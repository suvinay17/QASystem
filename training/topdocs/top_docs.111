The first half of the rugby season has given us a taste of how the game will
work once it becomes a non-stop year-round international sport. Over the
past 10 weeks, the Springboks have been in Wales, Scotland and Ireland and
Romania and Canada at Twickenham. The international games followed each
other rapidly.
After next year's Rugby World Cup in South Africa only three countries will
definitely pre-qualify for the 1999 finals - the two finalists and the
winner of the third place play off (a fourth may also pre-qualify if the
host is not one of the first three nations).
England may well pre-qualify as hosts but there is a good chance that
Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France will have to pre-qualify. The increase
in matches will stretch the international rugby calendar throughout a full
season.
One immediate result of this autumn's proliferation of internationals was to
marginalise non-international matches, namely the Varsity Match.
The internationals provided some pointers to world cup form. The Springboks
are nearly a great side. Against Scotland they were magisterial. They were
more fortunate the following week against a fighting Welsh side who have
found their pride and commitment again.
The Welsh had only one game plan and it did not involve using their
three-quarters. Instead Neil Jenkins, at fly half, kept the ball in front of
his forwards in the hope that the Springboks would give away penalties. It
nearly worked.
At least, in Derwyn Jones, the 6ft 10in lock, Wales now know they can win
line-out ball at will. It will be interesting to see if Alan Davies, the
Welsh coach, changes his one dimensional tactics for the forthcoming Five
Nations Championship.
For the South Africans, the Barbarian fixture in Dublin, was one game too
many. They graciously made five changes to their test team to give all their
squad the chance to play and thus revealed that they do not yet have a squad
that will win the world cup.
Few would disagree that in three of the five critical positions - at
full-back hooker and No 8 - they have, the best players in the world: Andre
Joubert, Ulrich Schmidt and Rudulf Straeuli. But at both half back positions
the jury is out. True, Joost van der Westhuizen, the scrum half, ducked and
dived to great effect against Scotland but his passing from the base of the
scrum was woeful and this meant that his fly half, Hendrik Le Roux, was
rarely ever able to impose his personality on his side's tactics.
Almost by error, the South Africans found a game plan based on their
emerging back row of Francois Pienaar (an inspirational captain and a public
relations dream), Ruben Kruger (the best player on tour) and Straeuli. By
their athleticism and presence this trio took games, shook them hard and
seized the initiative time and time again.
The Springboks looked tired alter the Welsh game. The time has come to move
the Barbarians game and follow the example of cricket. Cricket tours start
with a soft opener against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel. Visiting
rugby teams should start with the Barbarian fixture and the gate should go
to charity.
England easily, if somewhat clumsily, defeated a poor Romania XV and then
last week turned the screw against a battling Canadian side. The team is
beginning to settle - Simon Shaw, the uncapped Bristol lock, needs a few
games in the Five Nations' championships to bed him down ready for the World
Cup; Ian Hunter needs to be rehabilitated on the right wing and Mike Catt
will one day prove a brilliant deputy for Rob Andrew.
In the 1991 Rugby World Cup side, England finally decided that what mattered
most on the right wing was that the player would give no tries away and be
safe under the high ball. They chose a centre, Simon Halliday to play on the
wing. The same thought must be occupying Jack Rowell, the current England
coach.
He knows that Tony Underwood, who played on the right against Canada, is not
up to international rugby but he is unsure - rare for him - of the solution.
I suspect Philip de Glanville and Mike Catt will be tried out at some time
over the next few months.
England have developed an ability to raise their game for big matches. Their
15-a-side approach is how the game is played in New Zealand and Australia
and one effect is that the scorelines are much higher. Running rugby
involves a greater risk but is much more fun to play and to watch.
The Varsity Match was a classic. Cambridge emerged from the tunnel on to the
Twickenham turf slowly and deliberately reminiscent of the Scots under David
Sole four years ago at Murrayfield when the foe was England and a Grand Slam
was at stake. Cambridge played a wonderful game and deserved their win.
Naturally, it hurt, being an Oxford Blue, to see Oxford lose. At one time in
the second half they looked as though they were going to concede 40 points
but rallied and nearly won the match.
Cambridge used a tactic I had not seen before. At the maul, their forwards
did not pile in blindly hoping that somehow sheer strength would see them
through. They kept popping the ball up to the next player coming in. As a
consequence they ripped the Oxford defence to shreds. It was compelling to
watch.
Cambridge showed the northern hemisphere countries, who are fed up with
arguing the rights and wrongs of the turn-over law, a way to use it more
constructively.
The up-coming Five Nations Championship should have been moved to April so
the participants could have used it as the final stage of their build up. As
it is, the championships serve only to interrupt their preparations.
Scotland, unless they can drop Gavin Hastings, do not have a hope and will
win the wooden spoon. Ireland and Wales still have to demonstrate that they
understand the word variety. England and France again look as though they
will fight it out. England have so often been the favourites these past six
years, but have won only twice. The probability is that France will emerge
as the Five Nations Cup holders for 1995.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport: The Welsh dragon must roar - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELEVEN weeks ago I sat in the press box at Twickenham filled with
apprehension as England faced Australia in the final of the World Cup.
England had played heroically to defeat France and Scotland in eight days -
away from home, at that - but now, surely, their number was up against the
most gifted all-round team in the event.
So Australia's victory was not unexpected (they had beaten England 40-15
only a few months earlier). What was a surprise was England's stubborn
resistance. They outplayed the Australians in the second half when facing
the wind and outscored them by two penalties to one. Had England played to
their forwards, who were colossal that November afternoon, as they had in
their two previous matches, they could have beaten the Aussies.
But they did not. Instead they contributed enormously to a thrilling final
that did as much for rugby around the world as anyone could have wished.
Now here we go again. This afternoon England face Scotland at Murrayfield
and Wales play Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The 1991-92 five nations'
championship will not equal the World Cup in many aspects, if any. The
standard of play will be lower, the players less well-prepared and
motivated, but it is certain to add a bit of zing to life between now and
March 21.
During the World Cup, Finlay Calder, the Scottish captain, said he thought
the championship would diminish in significance in coming years,
overshadowed by the World Cup. I think he is wrong. The World Cup has raised
the public's awareness of the game and thus of the five nations. Rugby has
never been so popular; as a result, this championship is the most widely
anticipated ever.
Every ground will be full for the eight matches (610,000 spectators will
attend in all, paying Pounds 16m). England's home matches at Twickenham
could have been sold out three times over.
What makes the 1991-92 five nations so interesting are the questions that
can be asked: can England, under new coach Dick Best, win the grand slam
again? The odds are against them, even though they are the best team.
Successive slams have been won only three times in 82 years.
How will Scotland fare without the magnificent back row that was together
for 22 matches and outstanding scrum-half Gary Armstrong? Was Ireland's
stunning performance against the Australians in the World Cup quarter-finals
a fluke? The Irish have more match winners and more depth than for years and
they have, as Yeats said, 'still the indomitable Irishry'. What will these
virtues bring them in the coming weeks?
A much more significant question is whether Wales can make significant
progress towards parity with the other countries instead of being their
whipping boys.
This is an important matter to me. I am a Welshman. I was born in Wales of
Welsh parentage. My grandfather was involved in selecting schoolboy players
in Wales and remembers choosing a promising full-back named Vivian Jenkins.
I went to school in south Wales and on holiday in north Wales. I have sung
Welsh in Wales. I am Welsh from top to toe.
There was a time when I would have said it was good for Wales to lose a
match. It would puncture the complacency that existed around Cardiff. For
example, it would have been better for Wales if they had been run into the
ground by England in that notorious match in 1980, the match in which Paul
Ringer was sent off early on. Instead, a sordid game went down in Wales's
history as a glorious defeat.
Wales's third-place finish in the first World Cup in 1987 was also
unfortunate, for it papered over the cracks in their game. 'Well, boys, we
can't be that bad can we if we came third in the World Cup,' went the
argument.
But now, I have had enough of defeats. I am desperate for a Welsh victory.
Just as it used to be said that English rugby was strongest when Gloucester,
Coventry and Northampton were at their best, so British rugby is strongest
when Welsh rugby is at its best. Welsh rugby is the heartbeat of the game in
Europe. If Welsh rugby was as strong as it was 15 or 20 years ago, the
British Lions would be unbeatable.
When Welsh rugby is weak, as it is now, British rugby is diminished by far
more than one quarter. 'When Wales are out of rugby, rugby is out of sorts,'
says Tony O'Reilly. Welsh rugby is so out of sorts at present that only one
Welshman would get into a British Lions' side.
The good news for those from the land of the leek is that Alan Davies has
set about his duties as coach to the national team with flair and vision. He
replaced the Stakhanovite coaching techniques of his predecessor with a
lighter, defter touch. He raised the players' confidence, tried to make
rugby a game to enjoy, not endure. He has employed sportsmen and coaches
from other disciplines to talk to his players about fitness and has
recruited some of the most influential names from Welsh rugby of the past
two decades to help.
Whether it will be sufficient for Wales to achieve Davies's target of
winning one of their four matches in the five nations remains to be seen.
Wales have to play France at home, which is far better than facing them in
Paris.
England, however, must be faced at Twickenham. How Wales will set about the
task of countering the twin towers of Martin Bayfield and Wade Dooley,
England's gigantic locks is just one question that will be answered in the
next five weeks.
All I want is the start of a Welsh revival, a sign of something to sing
about. A strong Welsh team is good for the game. No one can deny that, not
even an Englishman.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Sport: Two codes, one language - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS

<TEXT>
SO YOU know your rugby union and your rugby league? You know all about the
schism of 1895. You can distinguish between the six-tackle rule and the
turnover law, a play-the ball and a penalty. You would not mistake Martin
Offiah for Andrew Harriman or Shaun Edwards for Dewi Morris. Most of all,
you realise that this afternoon both codes will be on display in London.
At Twickenham, headquarters of rugby union, Harlequins play Leicester in the
Pilkington Cup final and hope to do better than they did last year when they
lost in the last minute of extra time to Bath. A few miles north, Wembley
will resound to cheers of support for Wigan and Widnes as they compete for
rugby league's Silk Cut Challenge cup final.
Union and league, amateur and professional, 15-a-side and 13-a-side; the
shape of the ball is the same but in other aspects rugby union and rugby
league are, to paraphrase Winston Churchill's remark about Britain and the
US, two codes divided by the same game.
Rugby union is amateur, a game played by men who have other jobs. Rugby
league is professional, a game for which men are paid to play. That is
correct, is it not? Up to a point, but consider the following apparent
contradictions.
Bath, Llanelli, Leicester and Northampton and Gloucester rugby union clubs
probably turn over more money in a season than most league clubs.
Rugby league has one current star who can describe himself as a millionaire:
Ellery Hanley. Rugby union has two. David Campese has claimed he became
rugby union's first millionare three years ago. It is said he has been
joined by Will Carling, captain of England.
It is fashionable for rugby union officials (known, for a reason that has
never been quite clear to me, as alickadoos) to belittle rugby league. This
attitude is misplaced because, if anything, union has copied far more from
league these past years than vice versa.
In union these days it is commonplace to hear talk of a big hit, meaning a
fierce tackle such as that by Mickey Skinner on Marc Cecillon in the
semi-final of the World Cup. These big hits have come from rugby league and
are a direct result of the extra emphasis now being placed on upper-body
strength.
Australian rugby league players started the trend more than 10 years years
ago when they began to work with weights to develop their upper-body
strength. Previously they had concentrated on building up the torso and
legs.
When the Kangaroos (the Australian rugby league team) reaped the benefits,
the Wallabies (the Australian rugby union team) sat up and noticed what
their countrymen were achieving and added serious weight training to their
schedules. Since the 1987 World Cup, weights have become as much a part of
union jargon as drop outs, the 22 and the line-outs.
The scrum has never played a significant part in league. These days, it is
being downgraded in rugby union, too, as are rucking and mauling. These days
scrum-halves in rugby union put the ball in to the second row of their
scrums as a matter of course - as they have done for years in league. A
strike against the head is a rarity these days, like a try by a prop
forward. I have seen more than 40 games this season and from all the
hundreds of scrums in those games only once have I seen a scrum-half
penalised for a crooked put in.
That is not all: at the World Cup sevens in Edinburgh there were often more
players offside than onside; men standing almost on top of their opposite
numbers. This is beginning to happen in 15-a-side, too, and is another trend
that has spread from rugby league. So has the elaborate sign language
referees now use to explain why they blew their whistle - not to mention the
trend of miking referees for television.
If you think the lines between the two codes are clearly drawn then try
answering these questions: which clubs routinely draw 6,000-8,000 spectators
to a home game? Wigan do and so do Leeds, both of which are league clubs.
But, significantly, so do Llanelli, who have been so startlingly good in
Wales this season. There were 10,000 at Stradey Park on Wednesday night to
watch Llanelli clinch the league title. Bath would attract more spectators
if their ground was bigger. As it is, the capacity of 8,000 is reached at
almost every home game.
Which code offers its star players cars, houses, jobs, petrol money? Again,
the obvious guess is league, but increasingly the answer is union. There has
been a sea-change in the attitude to money and the like in rugby union, and
a new job, a sponsored car, help with a mortgage and money are commonplace
in the supposedly amateur code.
I think the two codes are closer together than ever. If I could not go to
Twickenham then I would climb on the Tube and head for Wembley.
Twickenham offers a confrontation between two outstanding flankers, Neil
Back of Leicester and Peter Winterbottom. At Wembley there is the chance to
see Jonathan Davies, arguably the most complete footballer of his time,
dazzling Wigan's all-star team and perhaps sparking an upset victory for
Widnes.
Frankly, I wish I could watch both matches live.

<TEXT>
Rugby league has overshadowed union this week, with the British Lions
beating the Kangaroos in the first of three tests.
At Wembley last Saturday, the English rugby league team, with one notable
exception, beat the Australian rugby league side 8-4.
The notable exception was the match winner, a Welshman, not any Welshman,
but former union hero Jonathan Davies.
His try just on half time came when Great Britain had been reduced from 13
to 12 men after their captain, Shaun Edwards was sent off for a tackle so
high and so dangerous that Edwards was lucky the referee did not award a
penalty try. Had he done so, the match - and almost certainly the series -
would have been lost.
Frequently in team sports, victory is not decided by the strategy of a
brilliant coach or his equally brilliant players but by the split second
action of an individual. Edwards' stupidity nearly cost his side the game.
Nearly.
Davies, at full back, and entering the line at the edge of the field, took
the ball on half way, sold an old-fashioned rugby union fly-half's dummy
and, because a league defence lacks the cover of the 15 a-side game, had
only one defender, the fullback, Brett Mullins, to take on.
Ten metres out Davies thought he would be caught and looked for support but
it had evaporated - testimony to his pace.
Davies made a split-second decision. He realised he had to find overdrive, a
gear everyone else thought he had been in for the past 40m.
'Try' went up the cry and even members of the press stood to give Davies a
standing ovation. The euphoria that swept Wembley could be smelt for minutes
afterwards.
Great Britain's win ensures full houses at Old Trafford and Leeds. But while
the game may never have been in better spirits on the field, all is not well
off it. Next year, Britain hosts the world championships. There is still no
title sponsor nor for that matter any sponsor of any description.
Rugby league does not want another competition sponsored either by
cigarettes (hooray) or alcohol. It wants to occupy the territory currently
occupied by its arch rival, union.
There is very little chance of that.
Meanwhile, in Cardiff, rugby union finally kick-started its international
season, (the Romania v Wales and Wales v Italy World Cup play-off games had
been a side show). In a dismal game, Cardiff succumbed to a very ordinary
South African side, now to be known, after some hesitation by the ANC
government, by their old name, the Springboks.
The four home unions are gunning for South Africa. This is because they
cannot face the future.
In the southern hemisphere the game has gone 'open'. Players are being paid,
in one form or another, contrary, it is true, to the spirit of the current
laws.
The game's base has moved since 1985, when the International Rugby Football
Board made its momentous decisions to hold the world cup and to hold it in
Australia and New Zealand.
In Australasia they knew the world of sport better. They had seen the
devastating effects of the Packer circus on cricket. What has happened? New
Zealand won the first world cup in 1987; Australia the second in 1991. In
1995, New Zealand, France, Australia and South Africa look the four most
likely semi-finalists.
France is the one leading northern country not eager to confront South
Africa over payments. This is because Jacques Fouroux, France's former
captain and coach, has said he is organising a professional circus, to take
place after the third world cup next year.
Fouroux has only four fixtures agreed but he does have television and
sponsorship deals in place. Hardly surprisingly, the games will be played in
South Africa. The only complication is that he has no players.
The home unions have lost the arguments. As Vernon Pugh, chairman of the
International Rugby Football Board, put it: 'The IRFB has been 10 years
behind the game. This has to change'.
As it is, the professional code is infinitely better as a spectator sport.
The game is harder and faster. It is simpler to comprehend. Every player
needs to be able to give and take a pass. The trick for each side, on the
surface a simple one, is how to break down one line of defence.
Quite the best thing that has happened to the laws is that the opposing side
must retire 10 metres rather than five after a tackle. It is this that has
added an extra dimension to the tactical part of the game.
The Australians use a huge variety of ploys. They are masters at running off
the ball. They do it at such speed and with such intelligence that I would
not hesitate to conclude, with two more tests yet to come, that these
professionals are the finest collection of athletes I have seen in this
country.
At the bi-annual IRFB meeting in Vancouver 10 days ago, the world's
governing body refused to make a decision on Pugh's report on the opening up
of the game.
'As I see it, what the Australian Rugby Union already has in situ, is what
we need to adopt throughout the world. No payment at club level; appearance
money for games played at provincial level and for our best players to be
salaried,' he said.
Going properly 'open' would of course mean that rugby union and rugby league
players could play either code at international level.
Union might try, each season, to contract every potential international
player to stop them playing the other code. But, even if this was legal and
I doubt that it would be, players would be able to move between the two
codes.

HAVE ANY industries been more closely associated with one sport than cotton,
and wool and coal mining with rugby league? As Geoffrey Moorhouse noted in
At The George, his book of essays about rugby league: 'The industrial
heartland of the north of England was powered by men who worked in the
mills, foundries and pits of the region . . . in time the majority of rugby
clubs in the north drew their playing strength from . . . these places.'
There is therefore, a particular piquancy that at the moment that Britain's
rugby league team has achieved its greatest success by reaching the final of
the World Cup at Wembley this afternoon, 30 pits are being threatened with
closure and British Coal is ending its sponsorship of Great Britain's rugby
league team.
Eighty thousand spectators will be at Wembley to watch Britain play
Australia, the world champions. Great Britain have improved so much recently
that the Australian coach said the current side would beat its predecessors
of four and six years ago by 30 points. Nevertheless, the Australians are
the favourites. They have held the Ashes since 1970 and won the World Cup in
1975, 1977, 1985 and 1988.
'They are the champions. They have beaten us in the past two Test series,'
says Jonathan Devereux, the burly Widnes back who was in Great Britain's
World Cup squad. 'Their record stands for itself and in Allen Langer they
have the outstanding player. If he was in our side then we would be
favourites. He has got everything. He has speed. He can read a game very
well. He has electrifying pace over ten yards, which is what he needs to get
through a gap. He can wrestle the ball clear of his opponents in a way that
is almost uncanny for a small man. He is a good kicker and he is very
tenacious.'
If Langer, a scrum-half, is a potential match winner for Australia, then
Martin Offiah is quite capable of doing the same for Great Britain. Offiah,
whose nickname is Chariots, is the fastest man on the field so long as the
injury he appeared to be carrying last Sunday when he played in the
Lancashire Cup Final has healed. Much will depend on him as it will, too, on
Gary Schofield, Great Britain's captain, playing in the centre, and on the
35-year-old warhorse, Kevin Ward, in the front row.
If Great Britain win, and it is an even money bet that they will, then they
will have demonstrated how much they have learnt from the Australians in the
past ten years.
A decade ago British rugby league hit rock bottom. It was time for change
and officials were dispatched from Britain to sit at the feet of men who had
once been their pupils. They discovered that Australian rugby league was
applying science to the art of football, setting scientifically determined
standards for everything from diet to fitness.
Whereas in Britain many training sessions included unopposed rugby, the
Australians favoured fierce physical contact in practice. This was one
radical change. Another that the British noted was the way the Australians
work with weights to develop their upper bodies. The British, up to then,
had concentrated on building up the torso and legs.
The result was a generation of massive, fast-running men like Mal Meninga,
the Australians' captain who is 6 ft 1 in and weighs 17 st 2lbs. This
afternoon he will face Gary Schofield who is 5 ft 8 in and 12 st 7 lbs.
Schofield is wiser and heavier than he was when he met Meninga in 1984 and
was thrown around like a rag doll, but he is still giving away five inches
and 65 lbs.
The Australians did not stop there. They trained hard so that they could
play the game at a fast pace. Having done all this, they set about shoring
up their defence so that it was well-nigh unbreachable.
'They put so much pressure on you when they have not got the ball that you
start to make mistakes' says Davies, a member of Britain's 1990 Test team.
As the years went by, the Australians refined all these skills, making
themselves more formidable still. One try in the second Test against Great
Britain in 1990 bore out everything they had been trained to do. The ball
was in play for 36 seconds and there were 16 passes before the try-scorer
touched down. No other team could live with such an athletic, skilful
approach.
The advances shown by the Australian rugby league teams were soon noticed by
that country's rugby union authorities as well. That code now produces big
men of great athleticism, trained to a higher level of fitness than ever
before. When these mastodons are teamed with key individuals in the key
positions such as scrum-half, stand-off and full back, then the entire team
whirrs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. The result is that the Wallabies won
the rugby union World Cup last year and there is no sign of their dominance
being ended.
As the Australians were pushing back the frontiers of the game, so in
Britain it was being professionally administered and marketed. In the days
of Eddie Waring commentating on BBC television on a Saturday afternoon,
rugby league was, frankly, a joke.
To my eyes, used to the rhythm of rugby union, rugby league was nothing more
than a series of crash, bang, wallop attacks. Six tackles and then something
had to happen. The game seemed one-paced, physically unambitious, tactically
sterile. 'Oooooop and oooonder' and 'he's taking an early bath' were
Waring's catch phrases.
Now it has become a game of considerable pace and skill - as you should see
this afternoon. It is as different from the rugby league of 20 years ago as
colour is from black and white television and jets are from propeller-driven
aeroplanes.
'Rugby League has remained unusually true to itself' noted Moorhouse, 'an
expression of values as well as a challenge and an entertainment now
embedded deeply in the lives of generations on both sides of the world . . .
But a game can be much more complex than patterns of athletic energy on a
playing field. It can reflect and embody various habits and attitudes that
amount to nothing less than a way of life and this game does.'
Like rugby union, rugby league is a game in its prime.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Sport: Scenes from a season - Rugby Union / The Five Nations
Championship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMEOS from the Five Nations' championship of the 1991/92 season, which ends
this afternoon:
Dublin, January 18. Wales surprisingly defeat Ireland, the World Cup
quarter-finalists. The one-point margin - 16-15 - is flattering to the
Irish. Welshmen are overjoyed and some former internationals, men who ought
to know better, are heard to remark: 'the Grand Slam next.'
The foyer of the Berkeley Court hotel five minutes' walk from Lansdowne Road
is crowded after the match. A Dublin student attending her first rugby
international is anxious to obtain the autograph of Ieuan Evans, the Welsh
captain. 'How do you pronounce his christian name?' she asks. 'The first
syllable is 'yi' as in yipes' she is told. 'Then you add the sound 'an' as
in 'and.'
Ten minutes later she returns, her cheeks flushed with pleasure. 'I met
Ieuan' she says, pronouncing the name almost perfectly. 'What a charmer. A
complete gentleman.'
The Irish players come down from their rooms and mingle graciously with
their own supporters and the few Welshmen who have gained entry to the hotel
of the Irish team. The Welsh are magnanimous in victory but the Irish, in
case anyone is in any doubt, are magnificent in defeat.
After the post-match dinner Alan Davies, the coach of the Welsh team, is
wandering happily around the foyer of the hotel savouring his first triumph
in the championship. A reporter congratulates him on victory and remarks
that he was lucky Tony Copsey, one of Wales's second-row forwards, had not
been sent off. Copsey was twice warned by the referee. Davies smiles
enigmatically and walks off.
Cardiff, February 1. The first home game in the championship for Wales is
marked by an outpouring of Welsh cliches. The Cwmbach male voice choir
brings some hwyl to the pre-match singing and song sheets are distributed
throughout the stadium. Players and officials from both teams are presented
to the Princess of Wales. Beverley Humphreys, an opera singer, leads the
singing of the national anthem.
This chauvinism is part of a campaign by the Welsh Rugby Union to promote
Welsh rugby. Other aspects of the campaign include naming the Welsh team the
Dragons and redesigning the national shirt.
One change brought about by Davies is consistency in selection. This Welsh
team is unchanged from the one that defeated Ireland. Wales show some fire
and verve in the second half but are 12-0 down at that point. Three
penalties by Wales in the second half are reminiscent of their revival from
6-15 behind in Dublin two weeks earlier. France win though, 12-9.
Dublin, February 15. Ireland, defeated by Wales and crushed by England, are
facing Scotland and 3-9 behind at half-time. Their stand-off, Ralph Keyes,
is booed by his own supporters for bad kicking. Long before the final
whistle spectators are leaving their seats. Mick Doyle, the former coach who
writes an acerbic column in the Irish Independent, was scathing after defeat
by Wales. 'Wales may be on their knees' he wrote 'but we are on our arses.'
After this latest defeat, 18-10, he is apoplectic.
Dublin is awash with Scots in kilts celebrating victory. They seem
impervious to the below-freezing temperature.
Twickenham, March 8. A dampness in the air does little to dampen the
occasion and drinks, jokes and laughter mixing well in the west car park
before the game. England are strong favourites to beat Wales and win a
second grand slam in a row, the first time this has been done since the
1920s.
As Will Carling makes yet another magnificent burst past Neil Jenkins he
reminds us that as an attacking full back he would be dynamite. The trouble
is he is dynamite as a centre.
England's performance is their worst of the season but for Wales there is a
word of praise from one of the gods. 'There is fight back in this side'
observes Gareth Edwards, the great scrum half. 'There is backbone that was
not there six months ago.'
Cardiff, March 21. Davies's period of office expires after the game between
Wales and Scotland this afternoon. He wants to remain as coach until after
the World Cup in 1995 and cool heads support him. Hot heads want more
success, however. Davies, they point out, has been one of the country's
least successful coaches, having lost five and won two matches since he took
over late last summer.
They are forgetting how bad Wales once were and how far the WRU have to go
to reach the level of competence of the RFU. Who will win in the struggle in
Welsh rugby, the Roundheads or Cavaliers, the cool heads or hot heads? We
must wait until April 2 when the general committee of the WRU meets to find
out.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Australia's shrinking violets - Rugby League; Britain
and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in Sydney, and
John Hopkins assess the two sides

<TEXT>
TIMID Australian sportsmen are about as common as possums in Pontypool. So
why are London and Sydney suddenly crowded with shrinking violets talking
down Australia's chances in today's Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley?
Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton set the tone before leaving for London, warning
that Australia's 2-1 victory in the Ashes series earlier this year was no
guide to form for the World Cup.
'Great Britain should be favourites. We haven't got much in our favour. If
we don't win at Wembley, our Ashes success won't mean the same. In football,
people have short memories,' Fulton moaned.
It doesn't seem to matter who you talk to. Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga and
experienced second rower Bob Lindner both warn that Australia will have
their work cut out to beat Great Britain.
Back in Australia, some of the experts are going even further. 'If I had to
put up my money I'd back the Poms,' 1988 World Cup star Wayne Pearce told
fans in Brisbane yesterday.
More is at stake than just the World Cup. Australia have towered over
international rugby league since 1970, the last time Great Britain won an
Ashes series. But they have never led the all-time league table.
This year's Ashes games left Australia and Great Britain with 52 wins each
since the first Test in 1908. A Kangaroos victory would justify Australian
claims that Sydney is now the centre of world rugby league.
So are the wily Australians serious, or are they trying to disarm the
despised Poms before sending out another team of fast-moving giants to take
the trophy back to Sydney, its home since 1975?
Fulton is clearly concerned about the long lay-off enjoyed by the players
since the end of the domestic season in September. Easy tour matches against
mediocre opposition like Sheffield, Huddersfield and Cumbria will have done
little to restore match fitness.
And taking a break does affect performance: the world club championship,
played in the Australian off-season, has never been won by an Australian
side, in spite of Australia's dominance at international level.
Secondly, Australia's pre-eminence over the last 22 years has encouraged a
focus on the domestic game, prompting many Australians to rate the local
Winfield Cup competition ahead of international games. Some commentators
fear the Kangaroos may not be hungry enough to win.
But the real cause of Australian caution is recent results, which suggest
that playing standards in other countries may be catching up, perhaps
heralding the end of Australia's long period of dominance.
The first crack in the facade appeared in 1991, when Australia unexpectedly
lost 24-8. in Melbourne in the first of a three match series against New
Zealand. More seriously, Australia were thrashed 33-10 by Great Britain in
June in the second Ashes Test, again in Melbourne.
For perhaps the first time two decades, the British made the Australians
look ordinary. Significantly, the match was played in the kind of soft
conditions the Australians are likely to face at Wembley.
Australia won the series after victories in Sydney and Brisbane, but no-one
who saw the Sydney Test will forget the electrifying sight of Martin Offiah
twice getting away on the left wing, each time denied a try by the narrowest
touch of boot on sideline.
Offiah's chances of escaping today must be improved by the absence of the
the injured Andrew Ettingshausen, the top class full back who forced him
into touch on both occasions. But as successive British tourists have
discovered, the structure of the modern game in Australia produces teams
which are very hard to beat. The Winfield Cup has expanded and strengthened
considerably since 1980, and now includes teams from Queensland, Canberra
and provincial New South Wales as well as Sydney.
The gradual enlargement of the competition has increased the pool of top
players and coaches available to the national side, and helped the game
maintain its dominance among Australia's four football codes, at least in
the core rugby league states of New South Wales and Queensland.
Ominously for British fans, the strengthening process is likely to
accelerate in the next couple of years, when the competition will be
expanded to include Auckland in New Zealand, adding all the emotions of
international football to the weekly league programme.
Like their British counterparts, Australian coaches put a lot of emphasis on
commitment, physical fitness and tough tackling. But the dry sun-baked
grounds also encourage speed and ball handling skills which are harder to
develop in the freezing dampness of English winters.
The Australians have benefitted over the last few years from the
inspirational captaincy of two outstanding players who epitomise all these
qualities: 'King' Wally Lewis from 1984 to 1990, and latterly Meninga,
Australia's most capped player and record scorer with 250 points.
Meninga's success in replacing the legendary Lewis has played a big part in
keeping Australia at the top of the rugby league tree, but it places a huge
responsibility on him in the final.
If Meninga and Allan Langer fire on the Wembley turf Australia's weasel
words over the last few days are likely to be quickly forgotten. If they do
not, all the advance excuses are unlikely to protect Fulton and his men from
a raucous reception back in Sydney.

FT  23 APR 94 / Sport: A World Cup of their own - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANET KELLOCK

<TEXT>
In January, Sue Brodie telephoned her friends Ramsay Jones and Sandra
Williamson to ask them out for a drink. That evening, at a pub in Leith,
Brodie sprung her surprise. The Netherlands had just announced that it could
not host the women's rugby union World Cup, scheduled for April. She
suggested that Scotland host the cup and the three of them organise it.
Brodie, Scotland's full back and the chair of the Scottish Women's Rugby
Union, Jones, Scotland team manager, and Williamson, Scotland's scrum half,
had just 90 days.
The three, with Sandra's husband George, contacted the countries which had
entered, rugby clubs around Scotland and potential sponsors.
Twelve countries agreed to compete, although Spain eventually dropped out
and was replaced by a hastily-assembled Scottish student team. Clubs offered
to host matches and use their contacts with local media to promote the
event. But sponsorship proved difficult to find. One company told Jones they
were not interested in sponsoring 'just a bunch of girls' trying to play a
man's sport.
Many of the competing teams struggled to pay for the trip. The US, Japanese
and Canadian players each had to find Pounds 1,000.
The teams were divided into four pools of three, but it quickly became clear
that they also divided into three classes, led by the US and England, who
were seeded to meet in the final.
The US started with a 111-0 win over Sweden and then beat Japan 121-0.
England faced tougher opposition. They played Scotland in a match that drew
a boisterous home crowd of more than 3,000 to Boroughmuir. Scotland produced
some of their best rugby but still lost 26-0.
The top teams have drawn surprised admiration from male spectators for their
ball handling and kicking. The accuracy of Karen Almond, England's place
kicker, against Scotland prompted flattering comparisons with male
internationalists. All the teams have shown physical commitment in the
tackle, even if not all of them have mastered the technique. At Boroughmuir,
the ferocity of the tackling by the Scottish centres drew pained gasps from
the largely male crowd.
For Brodie, Jones and Williamson the direct involvement ended after Wales
beat Scotland 8-0 in the quarter-finals last Sunday at Melrose. After the
match both teams did what rugby players everywhere do, they went to the bar,
exhausted.
Unlike most of the games in the World Cup, this had been a tense,
attritional, forwards' battle. Both sides had produced some moments of flair
and imagination but also made some stupid mistakes and decisions on the
field. While Brodie and Williamson nursed their pints and their bruises the
disappointment of defeat as players was mixed with the satisfying knowledge
that their bold plan to stage the World Cup had come off.
On Wednesday, Wales lost their semi-final 56-15 to the US while England beat
France 18-6. Tomorrow the US meet England in the final. Two weeks ago
women's rugby was a game that women should not be playing. By Wednesday
spectators were asking why men cannot produce such displays of running
rugby.

<TEXT>
Two weeks ago, I took one of the Sydney's new double decker trains to North
Sydney to watch the rugby union semi-final between Warringah and Gordon.
The ground has a Field of Dreams quality to it; it is a quaint and mellow
oval which could easily double as a home for a Palm Court orchestra and it
is owned not by Warringah or Gordon or by the Sydney or New South Wales RFUs
but by the local council. As such it plays home at weekends to the North
Sydney professional rugby league team and a host of rugby union sides,
something we, in England, find unacceptable, although why we do, is hard to
fathom.
Although Gordon caused an upset last year by winning the Grand Final -
Randwick, the best side, had done a Bath, losing their concentration, and
the match, in an early round - this year they have been a shadow of
themselves. Warringah, with a strongish pack and fielding the best player,
Mark Catchpole (son of the legendary Ken Catchpole), at scrum-half, were
favourites.
The game was played under floodlights to attract a larger crowd; the first
rugby league semi-final, which drew 40,000 to the Sydney Football Ground
that afternoon would have offered over-powering competition.
As I watched Gordon and Warringah my mind wandered, the game had little
attraction for the neutral spectator and I kept thinking that I had seen
parts of the ground before. It was not until later that it dawned on me that
the stands had come from the Sydney Cricket Ground when the 'hill' was
dug-up.
In the end, in front of 8,000, Warringah emerged the winners by 29-18 though
Gordon were much the better side. Warringah went on to lose to Randwick a
week later.
It was an unfair comparison but a week earlier I had been in the Bosch
hospitality suite at Ellis Park in Johannesburg to watch Transvaal narrowly
beat Western Province in the Lion Cup, South Africa's equivalent of the
Pikington Cup, in front of 42,000 spectators. That day, there were 20
prospective international players on show. At North Sydney there were none.
Sydney is essentially a village, you go to a bar or restaurant and bump into
the strangest of people. I ran into Sir Nicholas Shehadie who was Lord Mayor
of the city when I first visited in 1975 with the England rugby team. He
invited me to a game that weekend, the major rugby league semi-final between
Canberra and Canterbury at the SFG, where a month earlier the Wallabies had
beaten New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup with that tackle by George Gregan.
There was a buzz in the air. The media was excited and at the many
breakfasts, brunches and cocktail parties that morning, the talk was of the
game.
The ground, by Australia's best known architect, Philip Cox, ranks alongside
those at Murrayfield and Old Trafford. Sir Nick chairs the trust that also
looks after its neighbour, Sydney Cricket Ground.
We were joined at his table for lunch by, among others, a cabinet minister
and David Campese, the Wallaby back, fresh, or rather, unfresh from his
French Barbarian appearance in Paris against the Barbarians.
Big-spending rugby league club, Canberra Raiders, have had the most
brilliant season. Their full back, Brett Mullins is the best player in the
world and their line up also includes Mal Meninga, although he is well past
his sell by date.
Canterbury on the other hand are the local side made good, deeply embedded
in the culture of their south Sydney suburb. It is not unusual for them to
hold Greek or Italian family days. They have established a strong link with
the underclass in Sydney and they have carefully exploited their underdog
position.
The game was played in perfect conditions in front of a capacity crowd of
42,000. With just under two minutes to go to full-time, Canterbury led by
17-12. At the last, they succumbed to a try by the post and with the scores
level, the game went to over-time.
It was heart-in-the-mouth stuff and a replay seemed on the cards until
Canberra's Darryl Harrigan, a former New Zealand rugby union player,
squeezed in a drop goal late-on to take the game by one point.
All the talk - in South Africa, in Australia and in New Zealand - is about
how rugby union will go open. No-one, that is no one administrator or
player, has a blue-print that works beyond their own country.
In South Africa, the revenue from the provincial games runs into millions of
pounds. As a result, players are training five days a week and being
appropriately enriched for their full-time commitments. Nowhere else in the
world, except perhaps France, is this possible.
In Australia, Nick Farr-Jones, the captain of the 1991 Rugby World Cup
winners, suggested that the best solution for union, very much the poor
relation to League, was to: 'replicate the cricket scenario. We have grade
cricket, Sheffield Shield matches and internationals. The grade cricketer
gets nothing, the state cricketer receives appearance money and the
internationals are paid well.
'Rugby must do the same - club rugby doesn't have the support to pay
players; state and national rugby does. We must find a way to compensate the
players fairly for their efforts but l would advise against the players
giving up their day-job.'
Farr-Jones does not believe it would be wise for players just to play rugby
and not have some regular employment.
David Kirk, the All Black captain of the 1987 world cup winners, said in
Wellington, where he works as the adviser to the Prime-Minister, Jim Bolger:
'The change in emphasis in the game where players are seeking payment has
brought a greedier, less intelligent player into union.
'Too many of our current squad are unemployed or euphemistically employed by
unions or self-employed working somewhere in the so called sports business.'
Last Saturday, I watched quite the best game of rugby l have seen since the
All Backs demolished London at Twickenham a year ago, when I attended the
Auckland versus Otago match in New Zealand. The score, 46-30 to Auckland,
belies the quality of the skills on show. This was, I was told, how
Auckland, last season' champions, have been playing for three seasons and is
the legacy of a previous coach, John Hart.
I was fortunate to arrive in time fo the NZRFU Council's vote to decide on
who would coach the All Blacks for next year's world cup.
Laurie Mains, the incumbent, having lost an unprecedented four out of six
Tests this season was returned by 11 votes to eight. Poor John Hart was
defeated for a third time and will not stand again.
The debate about the 'coach' has dominated the news for three weeks and the
decision to re-appoint Mains became the lead story for the 1pm, 6pm and late
evening news programmes on all three TV networks.
That night, I saw a piece of graffiti: 'To win the world cup in '95, NZ
needs a coach not a Lawrie.' But do not write off New Zealand yet.

Something is wrong. Something is going right with English sport.
First, Terry Venables' appointment is applauded, second, Ray Illingworth
comes in from the cold to take the reins of the England cricket team and,
late yesterday, the Rugby Football Union continued this uncanny run of
common sense by appointing Jack Rowell, the Bath coach, to be the new guru
for the national side.
The announcement was expected on Monday - but its timing gives him the
chance of being fully involved with this afternoon's game.
Rowell's appointment will be widely welcomed, except perhaps by a few
die-hards within the RFU executive committee. Rowell's precise role will
need to be carefully defined over the coming months. He may want to merge
the role of manager and coach.
Dick Best is the present England coach, but the jury is out on his
contribution to the England set-up over the past three years. He is an
enlightened coach but his work for England has gone largely unnoticed. Geoff
Cooke has retained all the power in selection.
In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as
the pivot on which to base his England team. Without Barnes, a running
outside-half, Best lost the architect of his tactics.
Instead, we have had a diet of unrelieved boredom from the England camp, the
win against the All Blacks notwithstanding.
The England team, instead of building another dimension to their game, as
the Australians did between their Grand Slam in 1984 and their winning of
the World Cup in 1991, has gone from rags to riches to rags in an identical
period of time. And, in between, France and now Wales have made great
strides to catch up.
Cooke's control of the England team was suffocating the side. He needed to
relieve Carling of the captaincy and allow Dean Richards, one of his
bete-noires, the chance to lead the side until after next year's Rugby World
Cup.
Rowell's appointment may lead to a shake-up in the England team. He will
probably replace Andrew with Barnes and ask Will Carling to stand down as
captain. He is also likely to call on all his powers to ensure a fit Jeremy
Guscott at centre. If one player has been missed this season, it has been
Guscott.
We might just have reached the same conclusion over gifted Welsh centre
Scott Gibbs who has also been absent for the tournament. Without him though,
Welsh back play has matured and developed beyond expectations.
This is not just because of Neil Jenkins' coming of age, but because of his
right-hand man in the centre, Nigel Davies. For me, Davies has been the
player of the championship. Unsung and largely unheard of, he missed the
Canadian debacle in November and, through injury, the French game four weeks
ago.
But Davies has an acute tactical brain, safe hands and is a sound kicker.
Above all, he has one exceptional gift, he makes time for himself. The
Llanelli player will have his toughest game today against Carling. It will
be one to savour.
Romantics will want a Welsh victory. After all, there were supposed to be
only two teams in this championship, England and France. My how we all got
that wrong.
Commentators are already concluding that Wales' chance of achieving the
Grand Slam has come too early for the team. This is nonsense. Nothing comes
too early in sport.
Nevertheless, this is a wounded England side and there is nothing more
dangerous. They played so abjectly against Ireland that they still have
something to prove to their loyal supporters.
The side has developed a symbiotic relationship with them and they will want
to provide a game to talk about and a game with which to thank Geoff Cooke
for his sterling work over the past seven years.
The game again hinges on the play of the respective back-rows. Dean Richards
has that uncanny knack of always being in the right place at the right time.
His presence enables Ben Clarke to play a slightly wider game, one that best
fits the likes of Victor Ubogu and Tim Rodber. It is their pace over the
ground - which the Welsh lack - where the game will be won.
I do not see England being unduly bothered about tries in spite of the media
interest. They will want a win and will steel themselves to ensure it is by
the requisite 16 points so that they can claim the championship. I believe
they will do it. Twickenham is again host to another mighty occasion.

FT  05 FEB 94 / Sport: England's Back to the future - A preview of today's
Calcutta Cup game at Murrayfield / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England expects. England supporters expect a win this afternoon at
Murrayfield. They will not be too bothered by the score so long as it is a
win. A loss would be too frightening to contemplate. It would mean a triple
whammy of lost causes - the Calcutta Cup, the Triple Crown and the Grand
Slam.
England's famous victory against the All Blacks belonged to their
preparation for the 1995 World Cup, the venue for which is still in doubt.
For now it will have to be stored in the players' mental freeze frames.
Today, England begin their participation in the Five Nations Championship,
which is a tournament that has little or no bearing on the World Cup. Its
onlyplus is that it gives Geoff Cooke, Dick Best and Mike Slemen, the
England management and coaching team, a chance to build a squad of 25
international players, ready to anticipate the bigger prize. The reality is
that Scotland, Ireland and Wales have only the Five Nations Championship in
their sights.
Scotland still cannot believe that they have declined so quickly. A year ago
at Twickenham they looked to have the measure of England until Craig
Chalmers was injured and, after that Stuart Barnes produced that famous
'shimmy' in his own 22 and, aided by Jeremy Guscott, Rory Underwood scored
an audacious try.
Even in New Zealand, when the Scottish members of the Lions pack were shown
to be technically deficient, folk in the Border towns thought it an
aberration and, that once home, the players would prove their worth. Alas,
the horror story continued.
Ian McGeechan, coach to the 1993 Lions side, was able to conjure a Grand
Slam for them in 1990 yet this may well have been their nemesis.
Their own competitive structure is too insular and its talent is spread too
wide. Scotland desperately needs a Five Nations club championship. They have
again juggled their players after the defeat by Wales three weeks ago.
Chalmers may have left the stage for good, which would be a great loss to
Scottish rugby. He was always one for taking risks. Gregor Townsend, his
successor, has as much to carry on hisshoulders as Gary Armstrong, the
absent soldier, now returned. Armstrong will at least let Kyran Bracken, his
England counterpart, know he has been in a game.
When the England team was announced last weekend, there was jubilation
thatNeil Back of Leicester has at last, for whatever reasons, forced himself
into the side for his first cap. Back has the ability, rather like French
flanker Jean-Pierre Rives in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to take a game
by the scruff ofits neck.
His inclusion means England can play a wider game. Indeed, the tactical
options they have with him on board, are embarrassing. His speed tothe loose
ball, followed closely by Ben Clarke, playing in his favoured No 8 position,
means that the English backs will have a chance to run much more ball.
This will test the nerve of the Underwood brothers. Rory has not looked his
old self and needs one of his magical tries to convince supporters that he
has not lost his appetite for the game. His brother, Tony, needs to prove he
is a better footballer than either Mike Catt, of Bath, on the bench for the
first time, or Northampton's Ian Hunter.
Even without Back, the three quarters should be working with more ball
because of the brilliance of scrum-half Bracken's open play. He passes
first. Morris, his England predecessor, always checked the closerange
opportunities for a split second longer than was necessary and then passed.
Moreover, Bracken's pass is longer and gives Rob Andrew at stand-off more
space.
There was also a cheer in our household for the return of Jon Hall, theBath
captain. When international players fail to make the final trial - or these
days the new year training squad in Lanzarote - their playing ceiling is
lowered and they have to come to terms with playing only club rugby, going
on the after-dinner speech circuit and captaining Charity XVs on Sundays or
Gash XVs that open new clubhouses.
Such was my lot in 1980 when, after seven years of final trials and the odd
cap and tour overseas, I was asked to captain a rag bag of a Bath side
against Devizes RFC to celebrate their golden anniversary. It wasthe end of
April, the ground was concrete hard, and the kick-off was at 5pm on a
weekday afternoon - not a time to endear you to your employer when you have
already played 50 games in the season and used up every excuse in the book
as to why this game, above all the others, is vital.
We were losing, much to the enjoyment of the large crowd.
They ran yet another ball at us and, as I was watching this from my
unfamiliar position of fly-half, I thought that if they were to score we
would be sunk. From nowhere appeared a burly youth. He cut the winger down,
got up from the floor and immediately tackled the full-back into touch.
Wing fo rwards rarely consider such action in a friendly. This was no
ordinary wing forward. This was Jon Hall and I have followed his progress
over the past 14 years with keen interest.
He has had appalling luck with injuries and lesser mortals would have been
content merely to play. Not Hall. For him international rugby is a drug and
before he retires he wants one last chance to appear in a World Cup final.
He is one of the few players whose upper body strength is such that he could
have easily converted to rugby league.
At Lansdowne Road, in Dublin, Wales take on Ireland, where they have a good
record over the past eight years, with three wins from four games.
Ireland are always difficult at home and the crowd has become an integral
part of their game. They will need all their support.
Against France in Paris they were woeful and were lucky that it was the
opening game of the tournament. Wales look to have steadied their shipand
made some sensible selections. They should win but much will depend on the
weather.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: Big guns battle at the fortress / A look at the clubs
in today's cup final - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today fortress Twickenham (two huge raking new stands built; two to go),
again posts 'house full' notices. In the process, the gate for the
Pilkington Cup Final between Bath and Leicester will beat the 66,000 for the
Varsity match last December and set a new world attendance record for a club
game.
Bath and Leicester are by some way the leading two clubs in the four home
unions. They badly need a European club competition if they are not to grow
stale.
Leicester were the team of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before leagues
became established, the cup competition was the criteria by which success
was judged. Losing finalists in 1978, Leicester then won three cups in a row
and were losing finalists again in 1988 and 1989 (against Bath). It was only
last year that they began to re-emerge, winning the cup against Harlequins.
In the 1970s Leicester played a style of rugby which was exciting, open,
adventurous, intelligent and pacey. Generally they did this with a small but
perfectly competent pack and a fast-ish back-row. Critically, in the five
single positions on the field, hooker, number 8, scrum half, outside half
and full back they had five international players: Peter Wheeler, Gary Adey,
Nick Youngs, Les Cusworth and Dusty Hare.
A decade on there is only one international in these single positions, the
evergreen number 8, Dean Richards, the players' choice for player of the
year.
Bath, by comparison, were a joke side. I should know. I played for them for
four years. Under 'Grocer' Jack Rowell this has changed. Bath emulated
Leicester. They have done that very difficult thing. They have, like the
Australian national side, managed change successfully.
With Rowell being elevated to the England coach is this the end of the line
for them? Brian Ashton, Rowell's successor, has been his assistant coach. As
a player, Ashton was desperately unlucky not to be capped by England. He
was, with Jacko Page, one of the two best scrum halves in the country.
In the 1970s, Page played when England beat Scotland 7-6 - but he was not
selected for the Australian tour of 1975. Ashton went as the senior player
with Peter Kingston from Gloucester (also uncapped) as his deputy.
The week of the first international Ashton had a family bereavement and flew
home. Kingston won two caps and we never heard from Ashton again.
Under Rowell, Bath's success has been quite astonishing, beyond anything the
city has experienced before.
Leicester always had a more serious pedigree. Their annual game on Boxing
Day against the Barbarians, which dates back to 1909, has always been a
sell-out. Nevertheless, their comparative lack of success in the middle and
late 1980s forced them to advertise for a chief coach. They made the
sensible decision to bring in a fresh face, Tony Russ, from the Saracens
club and have worked hard to make the jump back to first class.
A win this afternoon would be a deserved return for their work.
It will not be easy. Bath are a formidable team, able to soak up enormous
pressure and score the winner when the game is two minutes into overtime.
Just ask Harlequins who lost in the semi-finals this year and in an epic
final two years ago.
It is now Bath who have the five internationals in the five crucial
positions: Graham Dawe (playing better than ever), Ben Clarke (ditto),
Richard Hill, Stuart Barnes and Jon Callard.
But, their best player of the season is undoubtedly Mike Catt who was capped
right at the end of the game against Wales. Catt reminds me of Jean-Claude
Gachassin, the free-thinking French three quarter of the 1960s who could
play anywhere and frequently did. He was rugby's equivalent of Johann
Cruyff, the Dutch soccer star.
In eight days, the builders will start hacking at Twickenham's West Stand.
Its replacement should be complete within 15 months. The RFU borrowed Pounds
24m before they knew that their share of the next television contract for
the Five Nations Championship would net them close to Pounds 12m.
Rugby's negotiators managed to keep two secrets. The first was that Sky, the
satellite channel, was never interested; the second was that the bidding
between ITV and BBC was very close. In sealed bids ITV offered Pounds 27m;
BBC topped it by Pounds 250,000.
Next Friday, at the Dorchester, rugby pays homage to the the Penguins and to
Tony Mason and Alan Wright, two stalwarts of Sidcup who founded the touring
side 35 years ago. Since then the Penguins have visited 32 countries
including the Soviet Union in 1977, Brazil in 1984 and Malaysia in 1994.
For players past and present, rugby is still the best amateur team game in
the world. The Penguin club epitomises this perfectly.

Rugby: Eagles 'Test' Their Wings
---
By Mark Jenkins</HL>
<DD> 11/17/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Thirty thousand boozy Welshmen welcomed the U.S. national rugby team to Cardiff Arms Park with a chilling rendition of "Myfanwy," the ancient Celtic hymn. 
Rugby is the state religion in Wales, and Cardiff Arms Park, the national stadium, is its holiest place. 

   So when the U.S. Eagles stepped onto the hallowed turf, they were regarded as a misguided flock of lambs offering themselves up for the sacrifice. 

   For the Eagles, the game that followed "Myfanwy" capped the team's grueling three-week tour of Wales. 
The exclusively amateur 26-man Eagles squad -- lawyers, bartenders, senator's aides and other assorted working types -- arrived last month and plunged into a battering series of encounters with top regional and club teams before taking on the national side. 

   "Touring anywhere is tough," said Eagle captain Fred Paoli, a Denver-based personal-injury attorney, "but in Wales it's murder." 

   After 10 days the Eagles were 0 and 3 against the "warm-up" teams. 
"So much for the easy part," snapped 26-year-old Eagle fullback Alec Montgomery after the team's 25-6 defeat by Glamorgan Wanderers. 
Along with his disconsolate teammates, Montgomery, a Harvard-educated investment analyst, hardly dared contemplate what lay ahead. 

   British journalists darkly predicted a drubbing by the Eagles' next opponents, Neath Rugby Club, the Welsh champions. 
The press was also declaring the tour a financial disaster for the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). 
Who in unemployment-stricken Wales would fork over #5 to watch their national team run rampant over so-called American all-stars who couldn't match local club sides? 

   But to the horror of the thousands of Neath supporters who did turn up to watch their club whomp the visiting Yanks, the Eagles made the Welsh club champions their first victims with a convincing 15-6 victory, running in two unanswered "tries" (touchdowns) and halting almost every Neath offense with the tooth-rattling tackles that have become an Eagle trademark. 

   "They hit us like they thought they were wearing football pads," grumbled one Neath player, sipping morosely on a pint of ale at the traditional postgame banquet. 

   The only person in Wales happier than Eagles manager Bob Watkins was WRU president Cliff Jones, who now sensed financial salvation for the Cardiff Arms Park "test" between the two national teams. 
Jones's spirits were further bolstered when, three days after their defeat of Neath, the Eagles steamrollered Pembrokeshire 21-15. 

   Within hours, the Eagles were being pursued by television and newspaper reporters, autograph hounds, and not just the occasional gaggle of giggling girls. 
"It's incredible," said U.S. Air Force Capt. Kevin Swords, the Eagles' 6-foot-5-inch, 250-pound lock forward. 
"Nobody knows who the hell we are in the States, but we're celebrities here." 

   The Eagles did not, in fact, come from nowhere. 
Unbeknownst to most Americans, rugby has enjoyed a long and distinguished history in the U.S. First played at Harvard in 1840, the sport soon spread from New England's soggy paddocks to the sunnier climes of southern California, where its popularity remains strongest. 

   In the early 20th century, as many as 26,000 spectators flocked to rugby games between the University of California and Stanford. 
The golden age of American rugby was the 1920s, when the U.S. won gold medals at both the 1920 and 1924 Olympics. 
Shortly after the 1924 Olympics, however, the International Olympic Committee cancelled rugby as an Olympic sport. 
Rugby continued to flourish all over the rest of the world, but without the Olympic incentive, the sport all but died in the U.S., and remained dormant for the next half-century. 

   Then came the turbulent '60s, with their tense combination of social rebellion and anti-war sentiment. 
On college campuses, rugby's free-wheeling but tough amateurism provided an alternative to football's hawkish image. 

   In 1975, the U.S. Rugby Football Union was formed, and soon afterward announced that it would be represented abroad and against visiting national teams by an all-star select side called the U.S. Eagles. 
Despite an unimpressive record on paper, the Eagles, who represent an estimated quarter-million active American rugby players affiliated with some 3,000 amateur clubs in all 50 states, have made friends all over the world with their no-nonsense brand of rugby, and nowhere more so than at this year's Rugby World Cup in Australia. 

   The Eagles were eliminated in the preliminary round, but not before posting their biggest-ever win over archrivals Japan and putting up spirited performances against two international rugby powerhouses, Australia and England. 

   And now, as if the Eagles have not had enough excitement for one year, the team found itself standing on the manicured turf of Cardiff Arms Park while the strains of "The Star-Spangled Banner" drifted off into the autumn mist. 

   On the ramparts of the stadium the Stars and Stripes fluttered alongside the Welsh dragon for the first time, while the 30,000 spectators below, who remained respectfully silent during the American anthem, erupted into a cacophony of boos and catcalls when the band struck up "God Save the Queen." 
When the last bar was played, the crowd launched into "Sospen Vach," the Welsh anthem. 

   It was clear from the opening whistle that the Eagles were in trouble. 
The enormous Welsh forwards drove their American counterparts backward from the start, turning the ball over time and time again on Eagles possession. 
After only two minutes of play, Wales fullback Paul Thorburne opened the scoring with a penalty kick. 
Three minutes later Glen Webbe stretched the Welsh lead to 9-0 with a try. 

   In stakeless exhibition games a powerful national team will sometimes go easy on inferior opposition in the interest of international rugby brotherhood, but in this contest the Eagles could expect no mercy. 
With the all-important Five-Nations Championship (England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) starting soon, Welsh players were out to win places on the squad for the tournament. 
And the Welsh coaches, criticized after poor performances by Wales against lowly Canada and Tonga at the World Cup, were not about to restrain their players in a mismatch against the upstart Yanks. 

   To cut a long and sad American story short, the final score was 46-0. 
It was the Eagles' worst defeat since their 1982 52-0 trouncing by England, and a huge setback for the team, described after recent encouraging performances as international rugby's sleeping giant. 
This dubious title was of little interest to the bruised, battered and bitterly disappointed Eagles slumped in the locker room at Cardiff Arms Park. 
All they could look forward to was a long flight home the next day, and the incessant and insensitive questioning of their co-workers on Monday morning. 

   "Sure it'll be tough telling people we lost that badly," said Alec Montgomery, enjoying his last taste of British beer at London's Heathrow Airport. 
"But Americans have to realize that compared to teams like Wales, we're novices. 
And don't forget, more than any other game, rugby is less about winning than playing the game." 

   "Yeah, right," said Kevin Swords, rolling his eyes. 
"Except we have to learn to play the game a lot better."

FT  20 FEB 93 / Rugby Union: Awkward Norster puts his expertise on the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LION-HEARTED defence by Wales in their Five Nations rugby union victory
over England two weeks ago has overshadowed one important aspect of the
game. The Welsh line-out work was superb. A supposed weakness was turned
into a strength.
This was a surprise, to put it mildly. Not long ago, Wales won only two
line-outs in an entire game against Australia, prompting one journalist to
write: ' . . . in the first half Wales won a line-out and in the
second-half, just to prove it was no fluke, they won another.'
The improvement is due mainly to Robert Norster, the Welsh team manager who
was one of the most effective line-out forwards in Europe during the 1980s.
He was awkward and thoughtful, determined and courageous, and these
characteristics helped him overcome a lack of inches. He is 6ft 5in and Wade
Dooley, England's big lock, is 6ft 8in - yet, in their meetings, it was
always Norster who came off better. Now he is passing on to his team what he
learned then.
The key to Norster's success as a player, and Wales' line-out performance
against England, is attention to detail. 'The line-out is a team
performance,' he says. 'It is not just about who jumps highest. You need a
bit of skill, accuracy and team-work. You have to work as a team, and we
did. I am happy to say that we won more than 80 per cent of our own ball
against England.'
There is much preparation before Wales play an international these days. The
technical department of the Welsh Rugby Union records each of their team's
games and those of future opponents. (A camera will be at Lansdowne Road in
Dublin this afternoon filming Ireland against France, to help Wales prepare
for their remaining matches in the Five Nations championship). Then,
sections of each match are compiled and sent to the players concerned.
Before the England game, the Welsh line-out forwards were sent clips of
England's line-out performances against Canada, South Africa and France
earlier this season. Then, at practice, Norster urged them constantly to try
new techniques and refine old ones.
He stressed variety and surprise. He made them rehearse their line-out
calls, routines and support systems. The result was that Gareth Llewellyn,
the big Neath lock, had his best game yet in the line-out for Wales and
fellow-lock Tony Copsey turned in a good performance, too.
It was typical Norster, who says self-mockingly: 'Even my friends would say
I am a bit over-regimented.' Derek Quinnell, the former British Lion who now
manages the Wales A team, adds: 'As a second-row forward, Bob was forever
organising people around him so that he could give of his best. He would
analyse his opponents and work out how best to counter them.
'He would sometimes make his opponents move forward to compete with him for
a ball, and sometimes make them go back. His style was to stand out of the
line-out and leap into it. He was very agile for a big man, spring-heeled, a
genuine leaper.'
Norster grew up in a hard school. Born in Ebbw Vale in 1957, his first rugby
experiences were with Abertillery; and he joined the famous Cardiff club in
1978, the year after he became a member of the Welsh national squad. Norster
did for his country in the '80s what another Lion, Delme Thomas, had done in
the '60s and '70s. Both won priceless line-out ball, often against bigger
and stronger men. In theory, neither was quite tall enough; but they made up
in technique what they lacked in physique. Both recorded outstanding Sargent
jumps, the method used to measure a standing jump.
As he developed, Norster acquired an uncompromising hardness. He needed it
in New Zealand when he played in two Tests for the Lions in 1983, and again
in one Test against Australia's Wallabies in 1989, as well as in 34
internationals for Wales between 1982 and 1989. He needed it, too, when
Wales beat England in the 1987 World Cup and, against the odds, at
Twickenham in 1988 - after which England coach Roger Uttley said ruefully:
'A player like Norster will always give you trouble.'
Most of all, Norster needed his hard-nosed attitude against Ireland in
Dublin in 1988 when chasing the Triple Crown (victories against all three
home countries in the Five Nations championship). Wales were up against it
and so was Norster, who had trapped a shoulder nerve after catching a
line-out ball and was in constant pain. Yet, he turned in a performance of
such courage that Stephen Jones was moved to write in the Sunday Times that,
in the second half, 'Norster grabbed hold of Wales and simply flung them at
the Triple Crown.' Wales won 12-9, sneaking home in the dying minutes, and
went on to win the Crown.
Even in rugby union's new professional atmosphere, it might surprise many to
learn that the Welsh players are backed up by their coaching staff, a
selection committee and selection adviser, two doctors, two
physiotherapists, a fitness adviser, a sports scientist, a match analyst and
a dietician. But it all tallies with Norster's philosophy. 'Attention to
detail has always been, and always will remain, an essential ingredient in
our preparation,' he wrote in the programme notes for the Wales v England
game.
At Murrayfield in Edinburgh this afternoon, we will see what ploys Norster
has thought up when Wales face the strong line-out threat posed by the
Scots. But you can be sure of one thing: like Baden Powell and the Scouts,
Norster will be prepared.

FT  05 MAR 94 / Sport: On the fast track to success - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We call them stadiums or pitches. Players call them tracks. And the fastest
track in Europe is the Parc des Princes, Paris. The reason? The French
national stadium, being a council-owned ground, is used for soccer and
rugby. The soil and the grass is specially prepared to cope with the
vicissitude of both games and one outcome is that the grass is considerably
shorter than at any of the other Five Nations venues.
Not only does this mean that the three-quarters have a chance to show their
pace, or lack of it, but the speed of the back-row to the break-down becomes
more important. One reason why so few away teams win at the Parc (Ireland
and Scotland have never won there; Wales did it last in 1975) is because the
game is much faster, and players succumb in the final quarter of the game.
It also explains why the scorelines are bigger than elsewhere.
England's brilliant wins in 1990, 1991 (World Cup quarter-final) and 1992
owe much to the way its forwards so dominated the scrums and line-outs that
France suffocated.
Parc des Princes has only a limited life. In 1999, the French Federation de
Rugby will move to a new stadium (also council-owned) being planned at St
Denis to house the World Cup soccer finals in 1998.
This is fortuitous, for it saves them raising the money to build or replace
stands, something which is currently exercising the Irish, the Scots and the
English.
St Denis will seat 80,000, an improvement of 25,000 on current capacity.
Bernard Lapasset, the French president, accepts that the enlarged capacity
may be a problem: 'We could have sold today's game out twice, but earlier in
the season we struggled with the Australians.'
Lapasset has helped change the face of French rugby since he succeeded the
ancien regime of Albert Ferrasse in 1992. The former Agen second row and
occasional No 8 (he won a championship medal in 1969 with the Under-21 side)
played most of his rugby in Paris - for Paris University Club and then for
the Custom Officials club which he helped found.
He still works for Customs, collecting tax debts. It was from this unlikely
rugby base that he made his way through the labyrinth of committees to
become assistant secretary, an honorary position, of the FFR, in the late
1980s. From there he challenged for the presidency in what he calls 'the
rugby wars of 1990 and 1991'.
Unlike England, where the tenure of the president of the Rugby Football
Union lasts a single year, Lapasset's term lasts four seasons and he is
likely to stand again in 1995. But, said Henri Bru, the rugby correspondent
of L'Equipe: 'It doesn't matter that for you the president lasts one year.
Dudley Wood (secretary of the RFU) is your president and everyone knows it.'
Two projects have exercised Lapasset's diplomatic skills. The first was
redefining 'amateurism' in the modern game.
'There is no definition of the word amateur. It is not a legal statute. For
us the word means the spirit of the game and that is what we must keep at
all costs,' he said. 'We do not want to play for money nor create a new
professional game. There isn't room in France with soccer, basketball and
tennis claiming so much of our attention and so much of the economic cake.
The critical element of rugby is its manner, its style, its traditions.'
Lapasset has forged a partnership with the players. Two months ago, after
eight months of negotiations involving all the international squad and using
great players such as Walter Spanghero and Jo Maso as a sounding board,
France became the first union to contract its players.
'Every player was asked to sign our player's charter. It sets out the terms
under which they are allowed to operate, including any commercial spin-offs.
Any player not willing to sign cannot be considered for national selection.'
Other countries have allowed players to have agents which has led in some
cases to national coaches and players sharing the same agent. This can lead
to conflicts of interest. The French have decided to run all the commercial
activities.
The charter enables players to earn money by promoting the game, a clear
contradiction of the International Rugby Football Board's laws on
amateurism.
Each squad player is allocated 200 kit bags which contain balls, jerseys,
videos and equipment to give to children. Players have visited schools in
Pau, Toulouse, Arras, Rennes and Paris. Targeting schools is new for rugby
in France, where sport is not part of the curriculum. These visits have been
a resounding success.
Meanwhile, the RFU has its own problems. It has called an emergency meeting
of the coaching committee for next Thursday. The successor to Geoff Cooke as
England coach should be announced at the executive meeting the following
day.
Over the past decade my old club Bath, under Jack Rowell, has managed to
change personnel while remaining successful. If the RFU hesitates over
choosing Rowell, English rugby will return to the hesitant years of 1970s
and early 1980s.

battle starts, one backbencher speaks against the majority / Rugby Union

<TEXT>
NEIL KINNOCK was at his most talkative. He had rung twice during the day
without getting through. Now the former leader of the opposition was in full
flow. He wanted to talk about rugby and specifically the international
championship, which begins this afternoon.
Whatever you might feel about his political views, Kinnock's thoughts on
rugby are worth paying attention to. He attended the same school as John
Dawes, the brilliant captain of the all-conquering British Lions of 1971. He
has dabbled in refereeing and when his constituency duties permit he has
coached mini rugby at London Welsh.
'Where would I put my tenner?' he mused aloud, and even on the other end of
the telephone you could detect the smile of pleasure on his face as he
considered the question. He, a patriot, was between a rock and a hard place,
forced to express too much admiration for England, anxious not to write off
Wales.
'England's backs are terrific footballers' said Kinnock. 'If Rory Underwood
played in the centre I would be very frightened. He has been under-exploited
on the wing and he is such a great defender. Carling is so creative and
courageous, Guscott is just magic to watch and Rob Andrew can do anything.'
In the end, though, Kinnock said he would not risk his money on England,
suggesting there were too many imponderables for Will Carling's team to be a
good bet for an unprecedented third grand slam in as many years. In this he
is almost alone.
Man for man England are far better than any other side. If you doubt this,
compare each England player with his opposite number in the other countries.
There are no Irishmen who are better, only one Welshman - Robert Jones is a
more accomplished scrum-half than Dewi Morris - and only a couple of Scots
and French.
Furthermore, I would back England against a side chosen from the best of the
four other countries, such is the hegemony and commitment they have built up
these past few years. If selection is based on talent alone, and nationalism
is kept out of it, then England should provide a record total of players for
the British Lions party to tour New Zealand this summer.
The French at Twickenham this afternoon are one of the two serious threats
to England even though they have lost the past five games against England.
Pierre Berbizier, the French coach, talks about this game as one in which
the quality of France's play is more important than the outcome. The French
are anxious to forget the bad-tempered games against England in the World
Cup in 1991 and the championship last February. Two Frenchmen were sent off
during this latter game and later suffered a large measure of humbug and
sanctimoniousness came from English officials.
The French are not saints. They have a tendency to kick, which to the
British smacks of cowardice because the victim is defenceless on the ground.
But England are not angels either and Kinnock is not the only person who
believes that the English forwards know how to antagonise their rivals and
have exploited this dubious tactic to their advantage in the past.
The new-look French team includes Jean-Francois Tordo, a flanker at hooker,
which seems a dangerous, though typically French, idea. Furthermore, the
French dislike Twickenham. They call it le cathedral and speak of it as one
might of a haunted building, as if shivers are running down their spines as
they do so.
'France on the right day might do it if everything goes their way,' said Bob
Dwyer, coach of the world champions, Australia. 'On such a day France have
the game to win though they have not developed much these past few years.
But as long as England are right, I can't see them losing.'
It will be no picnic for England against Wales at Cardiff where they lost,
surprisingly, in 1989. Wales are moving ahead slowly. They need regular
doses of dirty realism to puncture the sort of misguided optimism that burst
out after they had beaten Ireland last season.
It was hardly a convincing win - by one point and Tony Copsey was lucky not
to be sent off for landing a punch on Neil Francis that would have done
credit to Frank Bruno, if that is not being unfair to Copsey. It is true
that it was Wales's first championship win since 1989 but it hardly
justified the excitement that surrounded it. At the end of the game former
internationals such as Brian Price, J J Williams, Barry John were
cock-a-hoop. I heard one of them say: 'It's the triple crown now.'
Alan Davies and Bob Norster, as coach and manager respectively, have brought
some realism to the national team. Their off-the-field organisation is
almost as good as that of England and one cannot say fairer than that. The
problem that Wales have is they do not have enough good players in the front
and second rows nor do they have a stand-off. Most of all, they need an
on-the-field general in the way Dawes was when he captained Wales in the
seventies.
'If Wales are not psyched out in Cardiff' said Kinnock. 'If they get the
share of line-out ball that they got against Australia and if they can make
an tactical change ten minutes into the second half if things are not going
their way then they can beat England. I know those are a lot of ifs but it
can be done.'
My prediction is that England will top the table with four victories, France
will be second, Wales third, Scotland fourth and Ireland, who scored only
three tries last season, will be bottom again. I am seriously tempted to
place a tenner of my own on England. The white tornadoes have one more title
in them. If they win it for me, I will donate my winnings to a charity - of
Kinnock's choosing

FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: What England expects - Derek Wyatt looks forward to a
tactical battle at Twickenham / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England began last year's Five Nations Championship with a one point win
against France 16-15 and then lost by a point to Wales 9-10. If justice has
anything to do with rugby, England would have lost to France and beaten
Wales. The loss to Wales showed that Will Carling could not think on his
feet.
Two weeks ago against Scotland it was the same story. This time it was not
just Carling who failed to read the game but his lieutenant Brian Moore, who
led the pack. Time and again, Neil Back was exposed at the end of the
line-out; time and again the Scots cut off the route from Kyren Bracken, the
scrum half, to Rob Andrew, the fly half, and lured Bracken into unsupported
runs before ambushing him.
In recent years the public has revised its expectations from England always
winning, to England always winning with something in reserve. This afternoon
a one-point win for England over Ireland at Twickenham will count as a
national disaster. The team must not only beat the Irish, but must beat them
comprehensively; for the England management has decided that this is the
side that will beat France, the strongest team in the competition, in Paris
in a fortnight.
England's back play is constipated. I am tired of reading that the new laws
make it more difficult for the three quarters. At the Parc des Prince in
October, in the Second Test between France and Australia, Michael Lynagh
destroyed the French side by running and attacking them whenever he had the
ball in his hands. He hardly kicked at all.
Only Stuart Barnes and Mike Catt, both of Bath, can follow Lynagh's example
for England. Rob Andrew has a fine pedigree but his game has always lacked
vision.
Ireland will follow Scotland's lead and bombard Jon Callard with Garryowens.
Neither of the Underwoods is secure under high balls and Callard, who
remained largely untested against New Zealand, struggled when Scotland used
this ploy. I would have preferred Ian Hunter to play on the right wing to
act as a sweeper for Callard or even to switch with him in certain
circumstances. Gone are the days when wingers just stayed on their wings.
Tony Underwood missed a try against the All Blacks by carrying the ball
under the wrong arm so he could not hand-off his tackler. He did it again in
the Scotland game and again missed a try. He is fortunate the selectors have
such patience. In player parlance, he owes England one: in my book, he owes
England two.
For Ireland, Eric Elwood has been magnificent. Magnificent at kicking that
is. But the Irish strategy is hard to read. Elwood will soon be compared to
an illustrious predecessor, Tony Ward, who was frequently criticised for
playing just a kicking game. Will Elwood be allowed to play a wider game and
is he capable of it? Poor Simon Geoghegan - the Irish winger must be
starting to feel a forgotten man.
Against France, Ireland had one tactic: to kick the ball over the French
defensive lines. It failed but they went on playing that way and appeared
happy for Elwood to kick goals. Even though these tactics lost against
France and Wales, I doubt that they will be any different at Twickenham.
The French take an unchanged side to Cardiff where they have not lost to
Wales since 1982. The French front five is one of the heaviest in rugby
history, but the back row of Abdelatif Benazzi, Philippe Benetton and Marc
Cecillon could be severely tested. All three are specialist No 8s picked for
the lineout in spite of their lack of mobility in the loose.
The Welsh had done the psychologically difficult bit - they won their
opening game against Scotland and followed it up with a composed win against
Ireland. But their chance for their first Grand Slam since 1978, has been
undermined by injuries to their backs.
The shortage of tries and the increased importance of penalties, such as the
controversial kick for handling in a ruck that gave England victory over
Scotland, have exercised the rugby world this past fortnight. Since rugby is
supposed to be a handling game, I do not understand why it is an offence to
handle in the rucks, provided the player is not preventing the ball being
played.
The laws governing penalties are a muddle. The 'double' penalty that allows
sides to kick to touch and still gain the throw in has made line-outs even
more important. From the line-out the fly half then kicks the ball up in the
air in the hope of winning the scrum from the ensuing 'turnover' maul or
ruck. This is American football not rugby football.
The penalty laws have so changed the nature and balance of the game that the
international laws committee should reverse them at the end of these
championships. They could also add a rider that an offence committed in the
'penalty' area of the defensive side's 22 should result in a penalty in
front of the posts.

FT  17 APR 93 / Sport: Sevens brings home the cash - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NED HAIG and David Sanderson are the two Scotsmen credited with inventing
seven-a-side rugby late in the last century - the first tournament was held
at Melrose in 1883. I wonder what their reaction would be to the World Cup
Sevens tournament which began at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, yesterday morning
and finishes tomorrow afternoon?
Perhaps it is better not to ask. On the other hand, the Scots themselves
have given it an emphatic vote of approval. Tickets worth more than Pounds
1m have been sold and many more would have been sold if the rebuilding of
the west stand been finished. As it is, ground capacity is limited to
37,500.
The Sevens are brought to you by the same people who ran the full-scale
World Cup in Britain in 1991 - Rugby World Cup Ltd. ITV is transmitting
several hours each day. The sponsors are similar: Famous Grouse, Mizuno,
Bass Breweries and South African Airways. In subsidiary roles are Unisys;
Gilbert, the ball manufacturer; Umbro, the equipment maker; Medisport, the
supplier of medical equipment, and Citroen.
The World Cup Sevens is an ambitious title for an event that might in time
become as all-embracing as its name suggests but is little more at present
than an upstart cousin to the real sevens tournament the Hong Kong Sevens,
which was staged recently. The World Cup Sevens to that event is as
margarine is to butter.
There will be similarities, one of the most likely is that southern
hemisphere countries will dominate at Murrayfield as they did in Hong Kong
where the semi-finalists were Fiji, Australia, Western Samoa and New
Zealand.
Fiji, in particular, concentrate on sevens these days, perhaps to the
detriment of their performance at the 15-a-side game. They have competed in
25 events already this year and, in Waisale Serevi, they have the
outstanding sevens player in the world. Watch for him. He has a most
distinctive style: one minute he is lurking at the back of his team, some
way from the ball; the next, he will be running in for a try.
The Australians are making a big effort to win at Murrayfield, the undoubted
incentive being the chance of adding the sevens to their World Cup title.
Their team is built around David Campese (who is even more devastating at
sevens than at 15-a side), Michael Lynagh and the huge, strong and fast
forward Willie Ofahengaue.
Sevens is a lot more than half as enjoyable and half as good as the fuller
version. At its best, it can be sublime: seven men weaving intricate
patterns on a full-size pitch until one or two of them, by deft handling and
quick interplay, work a man clear. Then, watch him go  - sometimes, from 60
or 70 yards.
I grew up watching Ian Laughland mastermind London Scottish to victory in
the Middlesex Sevens in the 1960s, and then Gerald Davies dazzle his
opponents with speed and footwork when he helped London Welsh dominate this
event 10 years later. Those days are gone, along with pounds, shillings and
pence and the three point and four-point try. No longer are speed and guile
the two most important characteristics in sevens. A substantial physical
presence is just as important.
The Fijians and Samoans have brought a physical edge to sevens that has
turned it from a sort of high-speed touch rugby to a high-speed,
highly-physical game. The final in the recent Hong Kong tournament was
described by Dick Best, the England coach, as one of the most brutal games
he had ever seen.
Each player needs to be fast, most should be robust, and one or two in each
team must be play-makers. These are the characteristics needed to cope with
someone like Fiji's Mesaka Rasari who is 6ft 5in, more than 17 stone - and a
sprinter.
While the World Cup Sevens provides a feast of rugby, it is an
organisational nightmare: 24 teams - including many hardly known for their
rugby such as Latvia, the Netherlands, Korea and Spain - compete in four
pools of six. Minutes are vital. The semi-finals tomorrow start at 15.32 and
15.49 and the final iself at 17.16. Blink and you miss a match.
Weather permitting, the tournament will demonstrate the attraction of sevens
rugby. But there are doubts it will catch on in Europe as it has in the
southern hemisphere. Weather, fixtures, and the strength of the 15-a-side
game are all against the growth of the shortened game. So, you had better
make the most of it while you can.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Sport: Amateur? Pull the other one, chaps - Rugby Union /
How the code has discovered market forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO YOU thought rugby union was an amateur game? You thought it was the game
that was played for love and that those who wanted to play for money went
north, to play rugby league.
It was - once. But it is not any longer. The world has been stood on its
head. Rugby has gone from being a game of no money to a game of big money.
There is more money in the best rugby union clubs in England and Wales than
in the worst professional rugby league clubs.
For example, Gloucester handed over their commercial affairs to businessman
Mike Burton, a former England player, and in one season earned themselves
Pounds 140,000. Harlequins, the acme of rugby union clubs, signed a Pounds
350,000 four-year sponsorship deal with Flowers Bitter. A Heineken league
game between Swansea and Llanelli last month was almost certainly the first
club match in Britain to generate a turnover of Pounds 100,000.
For Llanelli, traditionally one of the richest clubs in British rugby, this
was the gilt on the gingerbread. This bonanza game came a week after the
club banked Pounds 18,000 for retaining the Welsh Cup last season. It came
within a month of the club receiving Pounds 10,000 for taking part in the
Heineken League and extending its sponsorship deal with Crown Buckley, the
brewers, for another three years for Pounds 150,000.
Such success among the leading clubs in the game is highlighted by the odd
exception. Bath, winners of the Courage League and Pilkington Cup last
season, nevertheless managed to lose Pounds 5,000. At Moseley's annual
meeting members were told the club was Pounds 120,000 in debt. Such
exceptions highlight the general situation, however.
With so much money sloshing around, it is no surprise that some of it is
making its way back to the players in one form or another. Here are some of
the things that have been said about money in rugby union these past 18
months:
A little over one year ago the coach of a leading London rugby club told the
following story. One of his most promising young forwards had come to him in
a state of some agitation having been offered Pounds 20,000 to move to a
particular club. What should he do?
The coach did not want to lose this player, whom he had coached since the
youngster had joined the club as a junior but the club had no money to pay
players. 'Go if you really want to' said the coach. 'Go with my blessing.'
Each member of England's World Cup squad expects to receive between Pounds
5,000 and Pounds 10,000 from their Run with the Ball campaign, launched
during the build-up to the World Cup and officially approved by the
International Board.
Danie Serfontein, the president of the Rugby Football Union, alleged that
some players had been offered Pounds 5,000 to switch clubs.
David Campese, the Australian winger, said he was rugby's first millionaire.
The Australian, allegedly earning Dollars 250,000 annually for appearing for
Milan, later said he was half joking. It is thought he was not joking at
all.
A leading player was being wooed by rugby league. Three businessmen got
together and by guaranteeing him Pounds 50,000 annually ensured he remained
in rugby union.
In South Africa, captaincy of one province is said to carry a salary of the
equivalent of Pounds 25,000.
'I know of a handful of players in the Scottish game who are paid for
playing,' wrote David Sole, the former Scottish captain, in his
autobiography . . . even small clubs in Wales are said to be paying players
Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 for each game. Sole alleges that one Welsh
international switched clubs because his pay was increased from Pounds 200
to Pounds 300.
It has become accepted practice for leading players to move from one club to
another. One forward approached two clubs, offered his services and asked
for a car in return. He was turned down by both. 'I now realise the best
players think the clubs have become benevolent societies for out of work
players' said David Watkins, team manager of Newport.
Some leading clubs are able to offer players a car, job and accommodation
and in very rare cases, all three.
A question: Is this money bad for the game? It has certainly changed the
face of it at the highest level. Rugby is fiercer. There is a real edge to
League games. The start of Northampton's match against Bristol in division
one of the Courage Leagues was as fierce as any game I have ever seen.
I dislike the abuse of the spirit of the laws, if not the laws themselves,
in rugby these days. Last Wednesday night during the game at Cardiff between
a Welsh XV and Italy, physios were on the pitch attending to injuries the
moment a player went down. Once upon a time, a trainer had to be invited on
by the referee.
By the same token, there is no adherence to the understanding that the
referee controls who is on the field. At one point while Wales were kicking
at goal two of the team's attendants were on the field handing out drinks.
And another thing. The replacement law is being used as a substitution law
in some countries. There is no observance of the spirit of the law which is
that a player can only be replaced if he is too injured to carry on.
So if everything else is changing, what is wrong with the arrival in the
game of large sums of money? Here is one way to control it. Name one home
game as belonging to the players in the way that footballers and cricketers
are granted testimonials and benefit matches and let them take the entire
gate, the money to be held in trust until they retire.
Rugby is played by thousands of clubs and market forces will determine which
gets the money and which does not. I suspect that in a few years the game
will comprise those clubs with money and the rest - and the rest will be the
majority. Is that such a bad thing?

FT  06 FEB 93 / Sport: When every tackle is a culture clash - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FRIEND Dai is a rational sort of chap. He lives near Birmingham (well, no
one is perfect) and writes calmly and only occasionally irascibly about
golf. There is nothing to suggest he has rabid tendencies. Yet, this man is
metamorphosed on occasions such as today when Wales are playing rugby
against England.
A couple of years ago, we were in Jacksonville, Florida, on the day Wales
faced England. In the early evening, Dai returned from telephoning home with
a smile as large as his stomach (which was, and is, ample). 'We stuffed 'em,
12-9,' he said. It did not matter that it was a rotten game. The only
important thing was that the men in red had won.
England versus Wales is, indeed, like no other rugby match. Wales against
Ireland is a meeting of (fairly) like-minded Celts. Scotland against France
has its own particular appeal, notably because the Scots have never won at
the Parc des Princes in Paris (or beaten France in Paris since 1969, for
that matter). But England v Wales has an edge that is sporting and
sociological, physical and political.
'Forget the All Blacks, the Wallabies, and the Springboks,' said David
Watkins, the former Wales and British Lions international. 'It's beating
England, the oppressors, that fires the imagination of every Welshman.'
In my view, the Welsh and the English are like the French and the English.
They are not meant to co-exist, and it is unfortunate that the two countries
are in such close proximity. One can sing, the other cannot. One can play
cricket, the other cannot. One owned the mines and the steel works, the
other worked in them. One bred sheep, the other stole them. One supplies the
water, the other drinks it.
Character and temperament are two differences that mark out the Welsh from
the English. Language is a third; Gareth Edwards and Barry John used to
confuse opponents by talking to one another in Welsh.
George Ewart wrote in The Strength of the Hills: 'No one can understand the
seriousness that is paid to rugby in Wales unless he views it as a social
and political affirmation of its nationhood. For a nation that has existed
for many years as subject to a more powerful one, it is the sheet anchor of
its self-respect.'
You need only a slight grasp of history to be aware of the sense of
injustice the Welsh can summon up against the English - and do, regularly.
Before the game in Cardiff in 1977, skipper Phil Bennett is said in his team
talk to have dwelled on every sociological and political slight delivered to
the Welsh by the English.
'They have taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our houses and
they only live in them for a fortnight every 12 months. What have they given
us? Absolutely nothing. We've been exploited, raped, controlled and punished
by the English - and that's who you are playing this afternoon.' (Wales won,
14-9).
In speech, England and Wales are two nations divided by a common language.
In England, the game is often known as rugger. In Wales, it is rugby - and
you will be laughed out of a pub if you start talking about rugger.
In literature, the difference is striking. England's rugby heroes are
described as if they are Greek gods. Of Ronnie Poulton-Palmer, it once was
written: 'The wondrous Poulton, the fleet and flaxen, a golden-haired Apollo
who stood as a symbol of the heart of England.' By comparison, the Rev Frank
Marshall damned with faint praise when he described Arthur Gould, of Wales,
a truly great player and one far superior to Poulton-Palmer, as: 'The
greatest centre three-quarter that has ever played.'
In their book Rugger, published in 1927, former England internationals
Wavell Wakefield and HP Marshall wrote: 'A man who plays (rugby) must be
ready to give and take hard knocks, but he will take and give them with a
grin. He will need courage and determination and a sense of humour, and he
must learn the meaning of unselfishness.'
Contrast that with this passage by Richard Llewellyn in How Green Was My
Valley, published only a few years later: 'But Cyfartha is like a
fisherman's net. The fly-half has been too clever and wants the try himself,
and on he goes, tries to sell a dummy, and how the crowd is laughing, for to
sell a dummy to Cyfartha is to sell poison to a Borgia.'
In spite of the two countries' differences, one date has considerable
significance for both: June 8 1987 when Wales beat England 16-3 in Brisbane,
Australia, in a quarter-final of the first World Cup. I think that was the
worst result for Wales and the best thing to have happened to England. The
Welsh reaction was to gloat - again proving themselves superior to their
oldest and bitterest rivals. The reality was that this victory covered
serious deficiencies. What was wrong quickly became apparent, and Wales
entered a trough comparable to that between 1923 and 1930 when they won only
nine of 32 games.
England, by contrast, began a recovery programme that has made them one of
the three leading nations in world rugby. In their past three meetings with
Wales, the English have scored 83 points, the Welsh only 12.
'Wales is proud of this victory. Welsh peers and labourers - with all the
intervening stratas of society - were united in acclaiming and cheering the
Welsh team. It was . . . a victory for Wales that probably is impossible in
any other sphere.' So wrote the Western Mail, the national daily newspaper,
the morning after Wales had defeated the 1935 All Blacks 13-12 at the Arms
Park. The same might be said if the Welsh win at Cardiff this afternoon.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Lions face extinction - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE time you have read this you will be one up on me, you will know the
score because the first Test against the All Blacks will be over.
I wish I could be more confident about the British and Irish Lions but
leaving aside my own prejudice that the whole idea of the Lions concept is
an anachronism, the selection of first Gavin Hastings as captain, and then
the old lags from England did not give me much confidence.
The English have this odd notion that a captain is the first name on the
cards, and then he invites his team to join him in representing his country.
But in the current regime of manager, team coach and specialist coaches, a
captain is more and more obsolete.
Hastings' experience of captaincy has demonstrated that under pressure he
has a tendency to go into his shell and see the game only in terms of his
own performance.
Will Carling is the most experienced captain. His record makes him the most
successful England captain this century but while he is a brilliant player,
he could not captain his way out of a tactical paper bag. He does not seem
mentally or physically fit. He played only 14 club games this season and on
the Lions tour he has struggled to complete a game. Furthermore, his abject
performance as both captain and player against France, Wales and Ireland
suggest that his star is on the wane.
Had the Lions selectors chosen the side first and then the captain, it would
have been a close thing between the maverick Stuart Barnes and the
irrepressible Dean Richards.
I sense that Carling does not want to be in New Zealand. He is a loner. He
is also Geoff Cooke's boy. Cooke was allegedly the only one to vote for
Carling as tour captain. Cooke's future as manager of the England team,
though written in stone until the World Cup in South Africa, still depends
largely on how his protege performs in the next Five Nations Championships.
England have, in Jeremy Guscott, the finest centre in the world. He can kick
equally well off both feet (and, even nonchalantly drops goals with
whichever foot he fancies at the time); who has pace with overdrive and who
is secure in defence but who yet may never realise his true ability. The
fault lies with Carling and, until Barnes replaced him this season, Rob
Andrew. They are instinctively defensive players and prefer to play a tight
restricting game.
This Lions tour may be the last of its kind, truncated as it is to 13 games
as compared to the Lions in New Zealand of 1950 (23 games), 1966 (25), 1971
(24), 1977 (25) and 198, (18).
The threat comes from the world cups of 1995, 1999 and 2003 and, the
possibility that a grand prix circuit might be arranged, if not by the rugby
unions of the senior international countries, then by the senior players.
Money has been a constant talking point among the players. The New Zealand
RFU has announced the All Black Club plan which will, whatever way you look
at, provide the players with a salary of more than Pounds 30,000 a year to
stop them playing for profit overseas. In New Zealand, that bedrock of rugby
union, all is not well.
John Kirwan chose to play in Italy, returning to New Zealand too late to be
considered for the first test. Kirwan, unlike David Campese of Australia,
who at least has Italian parentage, was not there just to visit friends. He
had a contract to play rugby.
Rugby union in New Zealand is under threat from rugby league and soccer.
Hence the announcement this week of the players' funds. Shamateurism is
breaking out all over. Of course, the International Rugby Football Board
could complain but it is toothless and happy to turn a blind eye so that its
power base is not further undermined.
Money was one of the problems on the first Lions tour in 1888 run by Andrew
Stoddart and Bob Seddon. Stoddart played cricket for England in Australia
and along with Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury thought a rugby tour there
would be welcomed.
After Seddon's death sculling on the Hunter River in New South Wales,
Stoddart went on to captain the Lions, and later, England and the formative
Barbarians. He was the first and last player to captain his country in
cricket and rugby.
He approached the Rugby Football Union for permission for such a tour. The
RFU gave its blessings provided the amateur regulations were enforced.
One of the 22 players chosen, A J Stuart of Dewsbury was banned from joining
the leaving party because he had made a deal with an outfitters to kit
himself out. Another player was apparently sent home when he was caught
discussing his chances of becoming a professional as an Australian Rules
player.
This seemed harsh. To raise tour funds and to the chagrin of the RFU, the
Lions played 19 exhibition matches of Australian Rules in Victoria, winning
nine.
It cannot have been coincidental that the next Lions tour, to South Africa
in 1891, was completely underwritten by Cecil Rhodes, prime minister of the
Cape.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Sport: Harlequin's last bow - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF SIMON Halliday has as good a game against Ireland at Twickenham this
afternoon as he had against Scotland two weeks ago, then the Irish had
better look out. At Murrayfield, Halliday was not just the dominant back nor
the dominant Englishman but arguably the dominant figure on the field. He
gave a performance of all-round play the like of which I have not seen for
many years.
Let us count the individual touches of England's right wing. They began with
Halliday catching the ball deep in his own half and near the right
touchline. Not much room to work with here. Boom] Halliday right-footed the
ball 40 yards down the touchline and into touch, a distance and accuracy
that a stand-off or full back would have been pleased with. It was a
reminder that he was good enough to kick two penalties for Oxford in the
1980 Varsity match.
This was followed by some mazy running. Halliday is 6 ft tall and strong
with it and on occasion is used to burst on to a flat pass at full speed.
Then he is about as easy to stop as a runaway car. Against Scotland he more
often demonstrated the art of elusive running, easily and light-footedly
shimmying past tacklers in a way that belied his 14-stone plus. One
remarkable run when he linked with Jeremy Guscott led to the try by Dewi
Morris.
In between this was some stout tackling in defence. 'Yes' said Halliday last
week when he cast his mind back to the Calcutta Cup match. 'In terms of
doing things right or wrong it probably was my best game in the
five-nations' championship. It was very satisfying, that game. I have played
at Murrayfield five times for England. The first time, 1986, was a record
loss - 33-6. The last was a record victory - 25-7. Since it was the last
time I shall play an international there it was nice to finish like that.'
Then Halliday was wearing the white of England. Now he was dressed in a
dark, double-breasted suit, the uniform of the City. Then he was intent on
doing his bit for England. Now he spoke quietly and seriously over lunch in
a City restaurant, a drop kick from his office at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
His open face was marked by the hint of a scar running down the side of his
right eye and blobs of bloodiness in the eye itself. The stitches, he
explained, were the relic of a collision with his Harlequins' team-mate and
England captain Will Carling. Halliday ran a finger tenderly down the fading
scar. 'A pure accident, of course,' he said.
He attacked his fillet steak. 'But that was not the best game I have played
for England,' he said. 'My best game was against Romania in Bucharest. I
laid the ball off well. For a centre that is the first responsibility. And I
helped to operate a smooth back line. That is another of a centre's
responsibilities.'
Alongside him that day was a young Englishman making his debut, Guscott.
Thanks in part to the service he received from his mentor, Guscott scored
three tries. Halliday, laying the ball off well, scored none.
There is a school of thought that says that the precocious Guscott has lost
his cutting edge in games for Bath since Halliday moved to Harlequins for
the start of the 1990/91 season. Not until Bath beat Leicester in December
did Guscott look as though he had recovered from the departure of his old
team-mate.
Halliday the Harlequin. There is a touch of the gilded youth about him, an
all-rounder on and off the pitch, one to whom things come easily. A graduate
of Oxford where he got a third in modern languages and classics ('you can
say I got an honours degree if you like') he speaks French well enough to
have acted as England's interpreter after the tense game against France in
the quarter-final of the World Cup.
He also represented Oxford at cricket and got close to a blue for squash. He
is, says a friend, devastatingly quick at crosswords, as is Rory Underwood,
the other England wing. Halliday's rugby career has been hampered by
injuries and selectoral quirks such as not picking him. Paradoxically his
ability to play both centre and wing at the highest level counted against
him.
Perhaps life mirrors sport after all. A strength of Halliday's is that he is
good at teamwork, doing what is best for a team without more than the odd
cheep of disapproval. It began at Downside School when he had one year as a
wing and two as a full back. It has continued for England  - 15 caps as a
centre, five as a wing. It is true at his job. As a salesman handling equity
funds on behalf of clients he works closely with five colleagues. 'You need
an ability to work in a structure and though others must say whether I am a
team man I think I have an ability to work in a team. I hope so.'
Halliday will be 32 in July. This is his last season for England. It is a
good time to finish. The World Cup is over. An England B team will tour New
Zealand this summer and he has no desire to be in it. He began his club
rugby with Harlequins and will end it there this season. Life turns full
circle. It is time for a change.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: The Cup that blotted out the fun - War and Peace
(Playing fields and battlefields) / It was the year of the World Cup and the
Winter Olympics, the bung and the bribe. Peter Berlin reviews the events of
1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The World Cup has grown so large that it blots out the sun for five weeks
and throws into shade other sports events for months before and after. But
around the orgy of marketing and broadcasting there was a normal sporting
year, with an abnormal number of extreme highs and lows.
The Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in February opened in a blaze of
publicity after Nancy Kerrigan, a figure skater, was attacked with a crow
bar during the US trials by Jeff Gillooly, the husband of her chief rival
Tonya Harding.
Kerrigan lost at the Olympics to Oksana Bayul of the Ukraine. In Britain,
24m people tuned in to watch Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean try in vain
to regain the Olympic ice dance title. Instead, the hero of the games was
the impossibly noble Norwegian Johan Olav Koss, an Easter Island man on
blades, who won three golds and set three world records.
The unfancied Welsh won the five nations championship in rugby, though
nobody could quite work out how they did it. Wigan won the double in rugby
league. But the visits of the Australian rugby league team and the South
African union side suggested that the centre of gravity in both sports
remains firmly in the southern hemisphere.
The balance of power in golf is also shifting south of the equator. Nick
Price of Zimbabwe won the Open and the US PGA. While Ernie Els of South
Africa won five tournaments, including the US Open, and a record Pounds
1.8m.
Cricket had its share of heroes and villains. Brian Lara broke Sir Garfield
Sobers' test scoring record with 375 against England in Antigua in April,
then joined Warwickshire, helping them to win three trophies, and scoring
501 against Durham at Edgbaston.
The England Test team continued to reel from crisis to crisis, pausing only
to raise their fans' expectations cruelly with competent performances
against West Indies in Barbados, where Alec Stewart scored two centuries,
and against South Africa at the Oval, where Devon Malcolm took nine wickets
for 57 runs to save the series. The nadir among many low spots was the
unseemly matter of the dirt in captain Mike Atherton's pocket. The England
team finished the year supine at the feet of Shane Warne, the Australian
spin bowler.
The Formula 1 drivers' championship was decided in the last Grand Prix in
Adelaide where Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill at speed.
Schumacher was widely accused of crashing deliberately to preserve his lead
in the championship. Like all the drivers, Schumacher is acutely aware of
the dangers of losing control. The whole season was raced under a pall after
Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in much-replayed crashes. If
Schumacher was so desperate to win that he was prepared to risk being a
posthumous champion, then he has crossed the line between bravery and
lunacy.
Perhaps the anti-blood sports league should found a branch to protect
humans. It could demonstrate at grand prix circuits, American football games
and boxing matches. Boxing resembles professional wrestling more every year.
But wrestling has better costumes, fitter performers and more plausible
fights.
Twenty years ago in Kinshasa, a superbly fit 25-year-old faced Muhammad Ali,
32 and deemed to be over the hill, for the world heavyweight title. Ali won.
George Foreman lost. It is a measure of how far boxing has decayed that in
November, Foreman, now an overweight, bald, grandfather, regained the
heavyweight crown.
It is easy to understand why Frank Bruno was so willing to foresake
pantomime in search of yet another last boxing pay-day, since there is less
and less difference between the two.
Tennis also needs a serious heavyweight champion. Martina Navratilova
retired; Monica Seles refused to unretire; Steffi Graf often played as if
she was thinking of retiring; and Jennifer Capriati, retired, was arrested
in a drugs raid, and then came back. The WTC raised the minimum age for
players to protect them from burning out. It then waived the rules to admit
two 14-year-olds with star quality: Martina Hingis and Venus Williams.
Pete Sampras finished the year as men's number one. He is the leader of an
elite of hard-working young men without charisma who hit the ball very hard.
The exception is Andre Agassi, who returned after a five-month lay-off and
won the US Open unseeded, pleasing those who still believe in genius.
The apex of the soccer year was not the World Cup final but the European Cup
final in May. Milan swept aside Barcelona 4-0 with a performance that seemed
to herald a new era for the club and the sport. Instead, the club's fortunes
have mirrored those of its owner, Silvio Berlusconi. In the autumn, Milan
lost the World Club final to Velez Sarsfield, a poor and unglamorous club
from Buenos Aires.
The World Cup in the US opened well. Fifa, world soccer's governing body,
had, it seemed, got it right. The stadiums were full; the referees enforced
new, harsher laws and, as a result, goals and play flowed.
A darker note entered in the second round after Diego Maradona was expelled
for drug-taking and Andreas Escobar was shot after scoring an own goal which
helped eliminate Colombia, one of the pre-tournament favourites.
Matches were staged at midday or in mid-afternoon to accommodate European
television viewers, and the soccer began to suffer.
Players had to work in conditions that ran from sweat-shop (New York),
through steel-foundry (Dallas) to Turkish bath (Orlando).
Teams that had spent five weeks playing in steam ran out of it in the end.
The final was a weary spectacle. It yielded no goals and was decided by the
inability of the cramped legs of Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio to keep
their penalties down.
The finals still yielded rich memories: Baggio's last-minute heroics, George
Hagi's guile, Hristo Stoichkov's explosiveness, Saeed Owairan's unorthodoxy,
Romario's gift for the unexpected, the Nigerian mix of delicacy and power,
the attacking teamwork of the Spaniards. The World Cup provided some light
in the year of the crash and the crow bar.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS much more at stake at Twickenham this afternoon than whether
Scotland can beat England in the 100th Calcutta Cup match between them and
win the Triple Crown of the Five Nations championship. The sub-text is this:
which of the two captains, Gavin Hastings of Scotland and Will Carling of
England, has the better game? The one who comes out on top is likely to be
named captain of the British Lions when the party to tour New Zealand is
announced later this month.
When the championship started in January, Carling was clear favourite. He
had led England to victory in 24 of 31 matches. Under him, England had won
two successive grand slams, were favourites to win a third, and had reached
the final of the 1991 World Cup. Carling, just 27, seemed to have it all
going for him.
Hastings, on the other hand, was the newly-appointed leader of Scotland
following the retirement of David Sole. After 41 appearances for his
country, during which he had scored 10 tries and nearly 400 points, his
abilities as a player were not in doubt. But he was untested as an
international captain.
How things change. England scraped home against France and then blew their
grand slam chance by losing to Wales at Cardiff. Suddenly, doubts were
raised about both the England team and Carling's suitability to lead the
Lions.
While this was going on, Scotland and Hastings thumped Ireland, lost
narrowly in Paris and then trounced Wales. Hastings, who missed five kicks
out of six against France, landed five penalties against Wales.
Carling and Hastings are bachelors, dashing and fearsome men who play rugby
as if to a script by John Buchan. Hastings thunders in from full back as
often as he can, relishing the opportunity to throw his 15-stone frame at
the opposition. Carling is lighter on his feet (he weighs just over 14
stone), very fast over 20 metres and has the upper body strength of a
wrestler.
Hastings, who is three years older and was first capped in 1986, one year
before Carling, has captained almost every team he has played in - Watson's
College, Cambridge University, London Scottish, the Barbarians. But, then,
so has Carling - Sedbergh school, England Schools, Durham University.
When it comes to deciding the captaincy of the Lions, two voices will carry
special weight. The first is that of Ian McGeechan, the Scottish coach who
also will coach the tourists.
'Gavin is very confident and very secure and positive in what he is trying
to do,' says McGeechan. 'Temperamentally, he is very sound. Because of his
size, he is someone we can work off. He can join the line well but, most of
all, he is good under the high ball. He has an outstanding reputation
world-wide; and if there is one thing he has done well this season, it is to
draw the new players in with the old players.
'I was pleased about that. I thought he was the right sort of person for the
role of captain, but there were those who said that he was not very
impressive as a club captain and, therefore, wondered why he should be made
captain of his country.
'To my mind, captaining one's club and one's country are two very different
jobs and I did not think you would know how he would respond until he was
given the job. His performances this year have got progressively better.'
Carling was first appointed captain when he was 22 and the youngest member
of the England team. It is easy to imagine the shafts of scorn that were
directed his way by some of the experienced forwards. Carling, after all,
was a fresh-faced squirt: public school, middle-class, officer material and,
to cap it all, a back, someone who did not get his knees dirty or soil his
hands.
He had to win his spurs with some of the hard-nosed members of his team and
Paul Ackford, the former England second-row forward, suggested as much when
he said not so long ago: 'Will is a good captain now.' The implication was
that, once, he was not. Carling's good looks, his success and his ability to
generate money have unleashed the green-eyed monster in many.
You could say that Carling is too smooth by three-quarters. He has, however,
a remarkable record. 'He is the most successful captain in international
rugby,' says Geoff Cooke, the England team chief who will manage the Lions.
Cooke was responsible for making Carling skipper in 1988, and has said it
was one of the best decisions he ever made. But he admitted: 'Eyebrows were
raised at the time. He was a newcomer to the team but we were looking for
continuity. We had lost several captains in quick succession and we wanted
someone who would hold his place.
'Rob Andrew was one candidate. Dean Richards was another and perhaps Brian
Moore as well. We looked at them all and came up with Will. He has to be
able to handle the off-the-field stuff as well.'
McGeechan and Cooke agree that a captain 'must have credibility among the
players' (to use McGeechan's phrase) - something which has not always been
the case on Lions' tours. 'You cannot earn respect as a captain unless you
first of all have it as a captain,' says Cooke.
So, will it be Carling or Hastings for the Lions? The choice is unenviable.
The sole blessing is that, for once, British rugby has two such good players
and captains from which to choose.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Sport: Northampton's mighty oak - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hopkins, the noted British sportswriter, will report regularly for the
Weekend FT on golf and rugby, joining a small band of regular commentators:
John Barrett (tennis), Teresa McLean (cricket), Keith Wheatley (yachting and
sports politics), and Michael Thompson-Noel (horse racing).
IT IS A matter of opinion whether or not Northampton is 'a dull place with
much nondescript modern development,' as it is described in the Blue Guide
to England. But suggest that its rugby team and its captain are dull or
nondescript and you will have to answer to some of the most partisan
spectators this side of Cornwall. This afternoon, coachloads of these
supporters will be at Twickenham to roar on - and I mean roar on -
Northampton in the Pilkington Cup final against Harlequins.
When the men in black, green and gold run on to the most famous rugby pitch
in the world, take a look at Gary Pearce, Northampton's captain. You can
hardly miss him. His neck is as wide as most people's thighs and his thighs
are as sturdy as the trunk of a tree. Wound around his head as protection
for his ears will be a yard and a half of sticky tape.
Pearce, who is 35, will probably be straining slightly as he leads his men
out, puffing his cheeks, pointing his toes, his large hands making the ball
look insignificant. He labours away at the game's pit face, the front row of
the scrum, where it can be dark and gloomy. As tight-head prop he is the
cornerstone of Northampton's scrum and as captain he is cornerstone of the
team.
He is the one who is never late on the team bus, never misses training,
always gets on with the job in hand and the man always proffered as an
example for younger players to model themselves on.
Pearce first played for Northampton three prime ministers, three general
elections and more than 13 years ago. He arrived from Aylesbury one Easter
and less than a year later was playing for England. Since then he has
acquired 34 more caps, the most by a prop forward, and has been on eight
tours for his country.
When you try to assess Pearce's assets as a rugby player you think of his
strength, which is considerable, and of how good he is at doing what you
might call the basic chores of his job. You won't see him frolicking in open
play; his 16 3/4 stone sees to that. But his scrummaging technique is so
faultless it could come straight from the pages of a rugby manual.
'Gary has very strong legs and always keeps his back straight,' says Barry
Corless, Northampton's coaching coordinator. 'From this position he can
drive forwards and upwards the moment the ball comes in. That is why he is
so good. You see so many props with their heads down near their knees in a
scrum and their backs rounded.'
Northampton and their homely ground at Franklin's Gardens have been
transformed since the summer's day three years ago when a cabal of seven
members obtained the necessary majority at an annual general meeting to oust
the existing committee and take over the club. Not everyone liked what
followed. Soon the tumbrils rattled. Pockets of discontent formed and
remain.
But even those old members who have boycotted the club since the revolution
could not deny the transformation effected by the new management. Three
years ago the club was struggling near the foot of the second division. This
season it finished eighth equal in the first.
Last season Northampton won the national sevens and reached the semi-finals
of the cup, thus drawing in more spectators. This has had such an effect
that membership has trebled - one afternoon last season as much money was
taken from one game as in the whole of the previous season. Northampton have
set a record for ticket sales for this afternoon's final - more than Pounds
130,000.
The Saints go marching in all right, taking coachloads of supporters
wherever they go. Every rugby club in the county will have at least one
coach full of supporters at Twickenham this afternoon, which is more than
can be said of Harlequins. The size of Northampton's invading force will be
considerable, even if it is smaller than Cornwall's army was in the final of
the divisional championship recently.
Last Saturday Northampton travelled to south-west London to play Rosslyn
Park in what was the last league game of the season for both clubs.
Roehampton looked at its best and spectators stood around, drinks in hand,
enjoying the warmth of a spring afternoon. The result was a foregone
conclusion from the moment Park scored in the second minute. The final score
was 48-0.
It seemed a shocking result for Northampton, who were only three players
below full strength, and to get some perspective on it I sought the views of
two of the most distinguished members of the home club.
Phil Keith-Roach, Rosslyn Park's former hooker and now coach, is as much a
part of the club as the netting that stops the ball flying out of the ground
and on to the Upper Richmond Road.
'Gary Pearce is so good technically there's no reason why he shouldn't go on
until he's 40, provided he stays free of injuries,' said the indomitable
Keith-Roach. 'I played against him in my last game for Park. I broke my neck
and thought I'd better retire. Mind, I was 42 at the time.'
Then I came across the massive figure of the club's president and former
England international, Andy Ripley, who beamed down benignly from behind his
John Lennon spectacles. I thought I would soften him up with an easy
question first.
'How are you?' I asked.
'Dancing on the end of a sunbeam, thank you very much,' he replied.
'And what did you make of that performance?
'Northampton are an unusual side,' he replied. 'They haven't got many stars
and they were obviously not very interested this afternoon. Next weekend one
of two things could happen. They could raise their game and win. Or they
could be overwhelmed and lose by a record margin. I'm not quite sure which.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: Championship on the line - A look at the key tactical
battles in today's international at Cardiff / Rugby Union: The Five Nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Five Nations Championship opens this afternoon with France (the
champions) playing rejuvenated Ireland, and Wales (the holders of the wooden
spoon) entertaining Scotland in Cardiff. These games will provide an early
test of how much the coaches have learnt from last season's experience with
the new laws.
This is the second year since the changes. Two changes have proved
particularly significant. The first is that if a penalty is kicked into
touch, the team doing the kicking is awarded the throw-in. As the number of
penalties has grown this has put a premium both on the line kicker, who
cannot afford to miss touch, and the line-out. Win the line-out and you win
the match.
The second-row forwards must now be better line-out performers than
scrummagers. The hooker must throw in better than he can hook. It does not
matter (as the French have shown) who throws in, as long as they throw
accurately.
Throwing has changed too. The two hookers in Cardiff today, Garin Jenkins
and Ken Milne take the ball behind their head (and therefore out of their
line of sight). Darts players throw from in front of their face and it makes
sense for hookers to follow suit, as does Sean Fitzpatrick, the New Zealand
captain.
The French won the first Test against Australia in October but this was a
fluke because they lost the line-outs. If the Welsh second row pairing of
Phil Davies and Gareth Llewellyn out-play the new cap, Shade Munro and the
old stager, Neil Edwards, as they should do, then Wales should win.
From the line-out the object is to cross the imaginary gain-line as close to
the forwards as possible. This has meant that all three back-row players and
the scrum-half try to batter their way through the first line of defence.
Expect endless variations on this theme from the Scottish trio of Derek
Turnbull, Robert Wainwright and Iain Morrison. The key is to make sure that
the ball comes back on your side.
When their teams win this position, the fly-halves, Gareth Jenkins and Craig
Chalmers will hoof the ball up in the air - the 'bomb' in rugby league, the
more prosaic Garryowen in union. When the ball comes down a defender will
catch it surrounded by the opposition who will make sure the ensuing maul or
ruck is inconclusive so their team wins the put-in at the scrum. This change
in the laws has altered the very nature of the game.
Wales have no players of sufficient individual brilliance to win matches on
their own. Scott Quinnell, Rupert Moon and Neil Jenkins at number eight,
scrum-half and fly-half respectively have to hold the side together. Jenkins
is having a fine season at club level but has struggled in his 17
internationals (much as Rob Andrew did during his first 20 caps). Wales so
badly need a fly-half. I hope it is his day.
The only certainty about Scotland is that they will turn up for the game.
They will need to experiment early on in the line-out by shortening them and
must not be afraid to run the ball from deep positions. Too often they have
waited until the last quarter of the game before gambling and too often they
have depended on Gavin Hastings' place kicking abilities.
Wales and Scotland fear failure and will keep their tactics simple. Both
teams will kick for yardage again and again. Wales must win. Scotland cannot
afford to lose.

<TEXT>
Since England's disappointing tour there in May, South African rugby has
hardly been out of the news. Fracas on the field has been matched by verbal
dust-up off it. Recently, Dr Louise Luyt, the SA President said in an
interview that rugby union would be professional by 1995, that Home Union
officials should be fired and that the 1991 World Cup was laughable.
No one within the hermetically sealed committee rooms of the four Home
Unions knows how to read the 'new' South Africa. It was not always thus.
Five years ago, when the political map of that country was more certain or
at least more dependent on the Afrikaner vote, rugby union, unlike nearly
every other sport in the world, helped prop up the political status quo in
South Africa.
There were no boycotts, no ban on players, referees or administrators
visiting the country from the body that pretended it represented the world
view of rugby, the International Rugby Board.
England toured there in 1984; New Zealand tried to tour in 1985 but a
successful court case led by the affable New Zealand rugby player Paddy
Finnigan QC stopped the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in their tracks in
the high court in Wellington. When Judge Casey deliberated at a special
sitting on a Saturday morning in Wellington, the whole of the country was
rooted to the spot. A packed public gallery trailed outside, blocking
traffic. When he found in favour of Finnigan the applause of the gallery
reached out, like a Mexican wave, to the streets and beyond.
New Zealand, whose own rugby union had toured South Africa without Maoris to
accommodate the apartheid policies of the South Africans, was posting notice
that it was growing up. Within months, the British Lions due to tour South
Africa in 1985, fearful also of a legal challenge, called off the tour. Only
the French, as ever, decided to break ranks, touring in 1990.
But there were two other tours. The first was the Andy-Haden-inspired
renegade tour of South Africa by a New Zealand Cavaliers side, and the
second was a group of international players who played in the white South
African rugby board's centenary matches in 1989.
Haden denies there was any incentive other than pride for the team he
secretly assembled. But the 1989 tour was altogether different. Such was the
subterfuge, allegation and rumour within the Welsh Rugby Union of the
amounts of money given to players and administrators who attended those
celebrations that a report was commissioned.
That report, of which there are three versions - one of over 2,000 pages,
one of about a 1,000 pages, and a shorter report of only 13 pages. I have a
copy of the shorter version. It states:
' . . . Had we been deciding this issue (payment) on the balance of
probabilities that, from the evidence heard, we would have found that most
(and quite possibly all) of the players were handsomely rewarded for going
to South Africa. By that we mean that they received money, and not just the
incidental benefits. At least one player received at least Pounds 30,000 and
others as much or broadly comparable figures . . .'
The report carefully lays the blame on the players but I am sure that the
administrators who attended were also well rewarded.
Who paid? Why, the South African Rugby Board under that wily old fox Danie
Craven.
The irony is that this report was carried out by Vernon Pugh QC, then an
innocent by-stander in Welsh rugby affairs. Three years later he is both
chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union and the International Rugby Football
Board. Two weeks ago, Luyt failed to appear at the interim IRFB board
meeting in Vancouver, where he was to be asked to explain his remarks on the
four Home Unions.
I would guess, therefore, that if you were Pugh, almost the last country you
would want to confront on and off the field currently would be South Africa.
Yet South Africa are in Wales and carrying all before them.
Once the sporting isolation was imposed, club rugby in South Africa
gradually became a bit-part player to the provinces. The provinces owned the
grounds and had the television and sponsorship. And with no one to play, the
country had little choice but to turn its provincial championship into a
mini-international series.
The gates were huge, frequently topping 40,000, often reaching the 65,000
capacity of the larger grounds. Consequently the amount of money piling up
was unreal in an unreal country. That money meant that South African rugby
union could stop its players following the country's cricketers to Australia
and England.
To keep them, deals were done. These started with inflated expenses and
turned almost into payments and then salaries. Luyt knows the score. What
irritates him is that he believes this is the direction all top-level rugby
union must go. He cannot fathom why the four Home Unions are hiding the
truth. He knows how much some of them were paid to come to South Africa in
1989.
Meanwhile, the side South Africa has brought to Wales and Scotland is good
verging on excellent. It is hard to see any real weaknesses except that the
team has not yet gelled completely and sometimes coasts when it is ahead.
There are some great players - Japie Mulder and Brendan Venter in the centre
and Mark Andrews and Dirkus Hatingh in the second row - but, as always,
South Africa takes time to settle when overseas. Just the public scrutiny is
hard for them to take coming, as they do, from a society that hid the truth
for so long.
They were last in the UK only two years ago when the last team of the Naas
Botha era played against England. Botha briefly played American football for
the Dallas Cowboys and yet was re-admitted to the amateur game immediately
his contract ended. On the field, Botha led South African rugby down too
many blind alleys because he saw the game only in yardage; making huge kicks
to take his forwards over the gain line.
Two years on, this side is fitter, faster, heavier up-front and stronger in
every position. Its only problem, apart from a still over-vigorous approach,
is that it cannot decide on a half-back partnership. Nonetheless, the
Springboks are preparing to be crowned world champions next year at Ellis
Park, Johannesburg.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: A change in view - A look at the battle over
television money / Rugby Union: Television Contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
English rugby's governing body, the Rugby Football Union, has decided that
it will not go it alone in the current television negotiations for the Five
Nations championship. The RFU's executive committee met yesterday afternoon
and decided to present a united front with its counterparts from Ireland,
Wales and Scotland.
Rugby's television contract from September 1, 1994 is for sale and as rugby
is a sport of political intrigue, the debate about who will win has caused
much commotion and emotion off the field. War broke out on the four home
unions television sub-committee when the RFU suggested that the traditional
equal split of everything needed reassessing.
The problem is that the French Federation de Rugby already has its own deal
for the Five Nations and for years has received more money than any of the
four home unions. The RFU was tempted to follow the French example.
At least yesterday's meeting means there will be an equal split of the
television revenues, but from only the domestic rights of the Five Nations
Championship. 'We're still thinking of a three-year deal,' said Dudley Wood,
the RFU secretary, 'but we wouldn't rule out a five-year option if the money
was right.'
When the Five Nations Championship television contract was last put out to
tender, three years ago, there were two bidders: ITV and BBC. ITV was
confident that having secured the 1991 Rugby World Cup it would win the Five
Nations as well. It did not. The BBC bid Pounds 10m which the four home
unions split equally.
But it was not quite that equal. Sport is not taxed in the Irish Republic,
so the Irish RFU's Pounds 2.5m is tax free. Wales' share was augmented by a
Pounds 1m contract with BBC Wales for club rugby.
The Four home unions need large amounts of cash. The English, Scots and
Irish are rebuilding their stadia. All are following England's lead in
expanding their infrastructure.
If a broadcaster came up with a generous five-year offer, the four home
unions would be compelled to take it. There are also signs that the RFU's
loyalty to the BBC may be wavering. 'We will have to go to the highest
bidder,' said Wood. 'We have the Twickenham West Stand to rebuild.'
For the first time, Sky Sports will be a contender. Sky follows Rupert
Murdoch's philosophy of using big sports events to build viewing figures.
Murdoch's Fox Network in the US has just paid Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
for NFL Football and has already made a play for the 1998 Winter and 2000
Summer Olympics. If Sky bids for world rights for the Five Nations for the
next five years it could push the price above Pounds 60m.
England's argument for more of the cake is irrefutable. Its team is the box
office draw and Twickenham was full for the London Division game against the
All Blacks, and the Varsity Match established a new record for a club game.
Wales could not sell out its fixture against Canada; Ireland failed to fill
Lansdowne Road for its game against Romania.
In order to attract the highest price the home unions will have to make
their fixture schedule more attractive. They can introduce a season-opening
fixture, for example a President's XV v a World XV (with the gate going to a
rugby charity; an idea that has been considered and turned down by
Twickenham). The Barbarians game could be moved to the beginning of all
tours and make way for a Lions match at the end. The Five Nations matches
could be played on both Saturdays and Sundays and moved nearer to the end of
the season to allow club and provincial rugby to breathe.
The four home unions sub-committee has been slow to understand the changes
in the media since the last television contract was negotiated. It simply
cannot afford to get it wrong this time.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Sport: Power but not enough glory - Rugby Union / Under
Dudley Wood England has grown rich. He tells Derek Wyatt his plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dudley Wood is a big lad. He needs to be. As secretary of the Rugby Football
Union, he sits on a rugby throne whose power and wealth has swelled in the
seven years that he has occupied it. Since 1986, the Rugby Union's business
has grown from Pounds 5m to nearer Pounds 45m; the staff from 50 to more
than 100. It owned the Twickenham ground, an assortment of allotments,
better known as car parks, and 26 houses nearby, now it has a rebuilt
stadium and a second ground complete with hotel in Wolverhampton. You have
to pinch yourself to remember that all this has happened while the economy
has been in reverse.
This increased financial strength has made England the dominant nation in
the talking-shop which some refer to as the Four Home Unions committee. But
on the field progress has stalled. The All Blacks triumphal progress round
Britain suggests that this afternoon's international will provide another
demonstration of the gap between England and the top nations in the southern
hemisphere. Wood is using his muscle to persuade the other home unions to
accept changes which serve England's aspirations rather than their own
interests. Wood plans changes to club rugby in Europe, in the way tours are
handled and in the five nations championship and the distribution of the
television revenue it generates.
'In future we will be looking to develop a Test series against an incoming
country like Australia. I suspect this would be two Tests. it would be nice
to think that we could hold one in the north and one at Twickenham. We had
the South Africans at Elland Road (Leeds United's ground) last year and this
year the crowds at Anfield (in Liverpool) and Gateshead for the New
Zealanders suggest there is a large audience for our game,' said Wood.
The reality is that with Pounds 28m raised to complete the north and east
stands at Twickenham - the latter is opened today - and the west stand due
for rebuilding starting in May,a two Test series would have to be played
entirely at Twickenham in the immediate future to maximise income.
Whether English rugby remains fashionable depends on how the team fares in
the world cup, due to be held in South Africa in 12 games', or 19 months',
time. Certainly, England's club structure, though heaving under the strain
of home and away Courage league fixtures, is vibrant and the envy of all,
save the French.
The Welsh, whose domestic league is sponsored by Heineken beer, want to
improve competition for their top clubs and have urged the creation an
Anglo-Welsh league. Woods said: 'There is no urgency to establish an
Anglo-Welsh league. The home and away fixtures must stay for one more
season, so we can best see how to adjust the numbers in the top three
divisions. There's no flexibility at present and if we had a bad winter I'm
not sure how we would fit in those matches cancelled.
'The four English clubs who met their Welsh counterparts the other day did
telephone me to tell me what they were doing. Of course, we understand that
these fixtures were and are important to them and add extra spice and
revenue. It is probably true too that at the moment the Welsh clubs need the
English clubs more than we need them. We have sponsorship deals to honour -
in Courage's case we've another three and a half seasons to go - and we
won't be dictated to by other sponsors.
'Adding more to the time-table would impact on the Five Nations which we
have been trying to push back towards the end of the season but we cannot
convince the French who do not wish to move their club competition. I'm not
sure we can expand it either. Romania is not the strength it was and our B
team has comprehensively beaten Italy and Spain so they must wait. America
is struggling and only Canada would be worth considering and two leagues of
five probably wouldn't work.'
The Five Nations Championships is the envy of all other sports. No-one in
their right minds would tamper with it, except . . . except . . . the
tournament is not serving the aspirations of French or English rugby.
The quality of the play in the five nations has fallen. The standards set by
Australia in the Parc des Princes three weeks ago against France and the
power of the All Blacks showed last Saturday against an embarrassingly weak
Scotland team, showed that it has become too inward looking.
While New Zealand has its sights on the World Cup in 1995, England has its
sights on the Five Nations and the World Cup. To some extent the Five
Nations is now an irritant in the preparation of the squad. Yet, it is the
proverbial jewel in the crown where television is concerned even though the
existing contracts are confused.
In France, the broadcaster Antenne 2 owns the rights for France's
championship home games until 1995. The BBC owns the rights to games in the
UK until 1994. Another UK broadcaster - Sky or ITV - could buy the rights to
the French games from Antenne 2 and put any new UK deal in jeopardy.
Ireland's state broadcaster RTE could do a similar deal. There is nothing to
stop them.
The Four Home Unions television sub-committee has not kept abreast of
developments in the European media and is still trying to formulate a
contract to put out to tender. Wood conceded as much: 'It has been a tricky
series of negotiations between the four home unions and about what we want
to put in the tender. We are aware of the holes that exist.'
In the past the four home unions have divided the cake into equal parts and
though Wood would not commit himself it is apparent that this will no longer
be the case. England, with the largest rugby population, will receive more
than the others, possibly as much as 40 per cent of the total.
The senior clubs, who want to negotiate their own television contract, shot
themselves in the foot a few weeks back. Racing at Ascot was called off and
BBC television offered to take the second half of the Wasps v Bath game live
for Pounds 15,000. The senior clubs refused, fearing it would harm their
gates that afternoon. Televising it would have given them some idea of the
pull of the leagues and some reaction from their sponsors.
It is sometimes easy to forget that all these developments have come about
because of the 15 England players who will try to stem the All Black tide
this afternoon. It is they who have created the increasing demand for the
game. Their development is being held up by the parochialism of the home
unions. If they had their way, I believe, they would want England to plot
its own future independent of the other three home countries.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Sport: Two clubs who have cracked their codes - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE not many days when I am torn between watching rugby union or rugby
league but today is one of them. This afternoon I could see the two
outstanding teams at their respective codes in action a few miles from one
another: Bath at Twickenham, where they will try to win the rugby union
Pilkington Cup a week after they wrapped up the league; and Wigan at
Wembley, where they will do the double if they defeat Castleford in the Silk
Cut Challenge Cup, having already won the championship.
Bath and Wigan are 250 miles apart yet joined by their outstanding success
in recent years at the two codes of the oval ball game. Bath have been the
dominant union club in England since the election before the election before
last. This is their seventh Cup final; they have won the previous six. They
have won the league title three times.
Wigan have found success at rugby league more recently. At the start of the
1980s they were in division two and facing bankruptcy. Such is their
transformation that if they win today it will be the third year in a row
that they have collected both of League's top prizes the Challenge Cup and
the Stones Bitter Championship: indeed, it will be their fifth successive
Challenge Cup.
The success of Bath and Wigan is often attributed to players and officials.
Invariably, however, there is one man who is oiling the wheels, whose
thinking sets the patterns, who can be regarded as the moving force of the
club.
At Bath it is Jack Rowell, the club's chief coach, who was recently
appointed coach of England's B squad. Rowell commands respect from his
players while retaining his distance from them. 'An hour with him is worth
five with anyone else,' a supporter said. Why? 'He talks such good sense. He
has one of the quickest minds I have ever come across.'
Rowell's work at Bath is in his free time, unpaid and voluntary. Rugby union
is an amateur game but it has not stopped him bringing the management
techniques and skill he employs as chief executive of Golden Wonder Foods to
the Recreation Field. He works tirelessly with his players, improving their
individual skills, making them more rounded players and thereby of more use
to Bath, making them what Wigan's chairman refers to as the complete
product.
Take Jim Fallon as an example. At Bath he has matured into one of the finest
left wings in the country, fast and, at nearly 15 stone, strong enough to
barrel his way past others. Victor Ubogu, the prop, is another who has been
brought on. As for Ben Clarke, the No 8 who joined from Saracens, he may now
be the best No 8 in English rugby.
Waiting in the wings are young men like John Mallett, the prop, and Audley
Lumsden at full back. One of the reasons for Rowell's success as a
businessman is his success with people. He is a natural pedagogue, a born
teacher and in the past 15 years at Bath he has worked the oracle with
successive captains, from Roger Spurrell to Simon Halliday and now Stuart
Barnes.
The man behind Wigan's rise achieved nothing as a player. For Maurice
Lindsay, Wigan was a cause he wanted to take up. He had the money following
the sale of his bookmaking business and the club was ready for a dose of his
cheerful common and financial sense and commitment. Ring Wigan in the early
evening after the office staff have gone and it is likely to be Lindsay who
answers the telephone.
He is running a multi-million pound business. The players earn an average of
Pounds 90,000; the minimum is Pounds 45,000. Including bonuses, the players
are expected to receive nearly Pounds 2m this season.
To meet this bill and other costs, an income of Pounds 3m is needed. Norweb
(the North West Electricity Board) is the club's main sponsor. Wigan were
always well-supported. Their average gate is more than 15,000, twice as many
as any other League club except Leeds and an astonishing tribute to the fans
and to the players. Thus match receipts make a significant contribution
towards the annual running costs of the club, as do a nightclub, smaller
sponsors and a shop selling associated products.
One of Lindsay's shrewdest decisions was to bring first the New Zealander
Graham Lowe and now John Monie from Australia as coaches. These two men were
at the cutting edge of the game in the Antipodes. Their success with Wigan
has tilted the balance of power towards northern Europe. In the vocational
aspect of his work, Monie echoes Rowell. 'I try to educate players to the
game, to understand themselves and their team mates. I'd like to think that
when I leave here they should all know enough to go on and become coaches.'
At Bath, Rowell has developed a blueprint that has withstood the scrutiny
and copying of coaching administrators at other clubs, such as Barry Corless
at Northampton. 'Orrell are a match for us in commitment, Northampton in the
way they have got the club organised,' says Stuart Barnes, Bath's captain.
'But at the moment and for the foreseeable future we have that ruthless edge
in will and determination.' There is no sign of this waning. They have lost
only two league matches at home since the league's inception.
For that matter, Wigan are in no danger of losing their dominance in rugby
league. Their crushing victory over Warrington last Sunday was their 22nd
victory in a row. Thirteen of their players will tour Australasia with Great
Britain this summer, the highest total ever from one club.
Wigan have swept every trophy except for the Premier trophy, and they could
win that this year. The double was rare enough until they first did it two
seasons ago. A treble would be unheard of, fantastic. But then Wigan are
just that, fantastic. Rugby Union could learn a lot from them.

SNOOKER: November 11 to 27, Royal Liver Assurance UK Championships, Guild
Hall, Preston.
The fight for the British title gets into full swing this week with the
bookmakers making Scotland's Stephen Hendry 2-1 favourite to take the Pounds
70,000 first prize. Ronnie O'Sullivan won the title last year, to become the
youngest-ever winner of a world-ranking event. At 5-1, he is second
favourite this time round and reckons the bookies have things about right.
In October, Ronnie, now 18, was voted Player of the Year, but says: 'Stephen
Hendry probably deserved it as much as me. He is still the one to beat.'
FOOTBALL: November 16, England v Nigeria, Wembley. European Championship
qualifying matches include: Northern Ireland v Republic of Ireland; Georgia
v Wales and Scotland v Russia.
When it comes to the football side of life, the biggest problem facing
England manager Terry Venables is finding good-quality opposition to test
his side in preparation for the 1996 European Championship finals. Romania
was a tough game, the USA a cakewalk and Nigeria should fit in somewhere
between those two. Still no place for Pounds 5m Chris Sutton up front, and
the Sutton v Collymore v Cole v Fowler debate rages on. Scotland manager
Craig Brown has named uncapped players John Spencer (Chelsea's Lion of
Vienna), Gerry Creaney (Portsmouth) and Darren Jackson (Hibernian) in his
squad to face Russia.
RUGBY UNION: Scotland v South Africa, November 19, Murrayfield
At Twickenham in 1969 everyone lost their heads. The demonstrators lost
their's, enraged by the regime that the touring South Africans represented.
And the Springboks lost their's, for in those days 'losing your head' was
the term used to describe the first defeat of the tour. Oxford won that day
and so, in the end, did the anti-apartheid movement. Now, on the first South
African rugby tour to Britain for 25 years, heads have again been lost all
round: first in the bloodbath at Neath, and then (in the traditional sense)
last Wednesday, when the Boks went down 17-15 in injury time to Scotland A.
That will have given the Scottish first team a confidence boost. But the
tourists are still very clear favourites.
RUGBY LEAGUE: Great Britain v Australia, November 20, the 3rd John Smith's
Test, Elland Road, Leeds.
The third and final Test of the series is one that the Kangaroos should and
probably will win, following their surprise defeat at Wembley and an easy
victory over the Lions at Old Trafford.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: Two hard Tests - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEON VILJOEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For England there is no respite. On Wednesday they were run close by Western
Transvaal, a provincial union so isolated and backward in the larger scheme
of things that its supporters proudly display giant flags of the old South
Africa.
England's tour of South Africa has so far proved a nasty shock to European
sensibilities. Which flag is which? And what to make of the 11 official
languages and the smell of cordite that follows them on to the rugby field.
England are supposedly testing the water ahead of next year's World Cup in
South Africa but they have hardly performed like potential world champions.
Thrown off balance by the aggression of their South African opponents, they
look vulnerable on the bone-hard playing surfaces of the high veld. Nor do
the rarefied air and the awkward bounce of the ball make survival any
easier.
They lost their first two games, to Free State and Natal. On Wednesday,
England looked no less tentative in their 26-24 victory over Western
Transvaal.
The one disruptive factor to which the English seem oblivious is the South
African ploy of speaking Afrikaans, to obscure lineout and other signals.
The language barrier may benefit Will Carling's charges. At least Victor
Ubogu, having not yet mastered Afrikaans swear words, has been unfazed when
singled out for verbal abuse. Physical abuse is another matter.
England's expanding casualty list, caused chiefly by the hard ground, as
much as their indifferent form, has convinced aficionados that their
two-Test challenge has already collapsed. If Free State and Natal can
dethorn the rose which such ease, surely South Africa will atomise them in
the internationals.
Two factors militate against this. Since its return to the world stage in
1992, South African rugby has been undermined by the very devices which
ensured survival through two decades of isolation.
The domestic Currie Cup competition has entrenched regional divisions to
such an extent that forging a new national entity may take years. Hard
evidence of the strength of provincial unions was provided by Transvaal's
win in the inaugural southern hemisphere Super 10 title last year, crushing
Auckland, from New Zealand, hitherto considered the best provincial team.
Two weeks ago Natal contested the second Super 10 final (albeit
unsuccessfully) against Queensland.
The South African captain, Francois Pienaar, was quoted in Australia as
saying that his provincial side, Transvaal, was a stronger unit than the
Springboks. This triggered a public outcry. Pienaar claimed he had been
misquoted, but whoever laid the words in his mouth was not far off the mark.
Had Pienaar not hurt his ankle the quote would almost certainly have
contributed to his losing the captaincy against England to fellow back row
forward, Tiaan Strauss.
The worst effect of the isolation era on the South African game has been an
erosion of refereeing standards. The comfy cocoon of so-called South African
invincibility was kept intact by officials badly out of step with world
standards.
This anomaly was exposed during the French tour to South Africa last season.
Like England, the Tricolores were no great shakes in the build-up to the
Tests, yet won the series 1-0, with a win and a draw.
South Africa could not adapt to the sudden return to an international
standard, applied by overseas referees in the Tests. I suspect England are
awaiting the arrival of the New Zealand referee Colin Hawke with
anticipation.
But poor refereeing does not explain why England have been so lacklustre.
Without the silky Jeremy Guscott, the backline appears wooden. Free State
played an attacking game to good effect by running first phase ball wide.
South Africa will also probe on the periphery, in part because they lack the
lineout forwards to match England.
South Africa's coach Ian Mclntosh, preoccupied with ball retention drills,
has been criticised for neglecting running rugby and the natural flair of
the South African three-quarters.
England might be looking increasingly dilapidated but South Africa's final
training session, with a bloated squad of 57 players, many of them injured,
sought refuge at a 'secret' venue; a sure sign of panic.
The Tests may turn on whether England can summon a heroic display from their
overworked pack. If England win another tryless victory, their fans can find
solace in the words of the late Boy Louw. Louw, one of South Africa's most
versatile forwards in the 1920s and 30s, was a national team manager with a
gift for the gab, if not for the English language.
Berated by the media after his team won by kicking all its points, Louw shot
back: 'Never mind. Just you looks at the scoreboard]'

FT  19 MAR 94 / As They say in Europe: A Titanic sinking on the rugby field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is reason to believe that today could be marked by extraordinary, even
catastrophic, events. If France lose their final match in the five nations'
rugby championship against Scotland this afternoon, there is fair chance the
team will be wiped out by a public driven beyond all reasonable levels of
tolerance. Even more amazing will be the sight of the French sports writers
disappearing en masse in a flash of spontaneous combustion, or flinging
themselves from the highest point of the Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh.
There will be different motives. The commentators on the France-Inter radio
station will be enraged by the unfairness of it all. Their reporting of the
(losing) game against England in Paris a fortnight ago was enlivened, for
me, by the succession of invisible fouls committed by English players, and
by a total ignorance of rule 13 which the referee (rightly) used to stop
Thierry Lacroix having a second go at a conversion attempt when the ball had
fallen over. 'We are all Europeans and therefore impartial, but really . . .
' said Eric somebody or other into his microphone.
The game also 'appeared' entirely different because, in the mouths of the
commentary team, the distinctly unandrogynous England hooker, Brian Moore,
emerged as Brie-Anne Morre, surely an American hooker.
In the newspapers, however, there was no feeling that France were victims.
The French writers decided, unanimously, that there was just one problem:
their team was no good. This was not just a matter of losing against
moderate opposition, nor of failing to play up to expected standards. It was
a failure of cosmic proportions - a sinking of the Titanic on the rugby
field. It was the kind of failure of which the former - and much-maligned -
England soccer manager, Graham Taylor, could only dream.
There were hints of catastrophe in earlier matches. The wide but
insubstantial victory over Ireland at Paris's Parc des Princes in the first
match raised doubts. Defeat by Wales in Cardiff rang alarm bells. 'Le feu
rouge,' shouted L'Equipe on its front page. This play on words meant either
Welsh fire or a red traffic light. After that match, coach Pierre Berbizier
commented: 'I preferred today's defeat to the victory of two years ago. I
know how we were beaten, but not how we won last time here.'
That was a hostage to fortune. For, by the time England arrived in Paris,
the press wanted no more understandable defeats but a victory. Especially
against a side that always beat them, especially at home.
Disaster struck: France were beaten 18-14. On page one, L'Equipe shouted:
'Change all this for us.' Page two was headlined 'The great fiasco', while
the newspaper declared the French XV to be brain-dead on page three under a
headline that read: 'The encephelogram is flat.'
Midi-Olympique was relatively phlegmatic: 'France is passing through its
worst crisis since the second world war,' it said, before asking: 'How has
France fallen so low?' It then opened what it called 'The burning dossiers
of tricolour rugby.'
In the nation's rugby capital, Toulouse, La Depeche du dimanche began its
report: 'This new defeat by England undoubtedly marks the end of a team
which, decidedly, has nothing more to give, not the savoir-faire, nor the
indispensable success at this level.'
It concluded: 'At the end of such a mediocre, yet poignant, match, it is not
appropriate to put forward ideas; a delirium of destruction cannot be
avoided.'
The 'poignancy' of the match came in the way England played. It consisted of
everything that arouses Gallic scorn, admiration and resentment. England
were boring, disciplined, resolute, unimaginative. A former national
fullback, Pierre Villepreux, wrote in Liberation: 'The English had no
doubts, even when France were dominant. They played on a tactical base which
they fully mastered . . . a game which brought together their culture and
education.'
In a typically Marxist interpretation of rugby, Villepreux concluded that
what counted was a unity of practice and tactics - something the French
lacked entirely.
There is a new team for today which excludes Olivier Roumat, the captain
against England, Wales and Ireland. L'Equipe proclaimed: 'It is not yet the
Regency, nor is it the end of the Empire.' There has been no 'delirium of
destruction,' though. Thierry Lacroix, whose missed kicks probably cost
France victory two weeks ago, said he was prepared for anything. 'We've been
slaughtered by the press and television all week,' he said.
But the critics are keeping their powder dry. After all, if Wales beat
England, as they will, and France beat a Scottish XV missing its best
player, scrum-half Gary Armstrong, as they will, France will finish second
this afternoon. Not bad for a side 'without aggression, will or
imagination'.

FT  02 OCT 93 / Sport: How Bath play the power game - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACK ROWELL is the managing dictator of Bath rugby club. The charismatic
coach from Hartlepool in north east England has created a centre of rugby
excellence that is the envy of the world.
His record since becoming coach at Bath in 1977 is extraordinary, having
already achieved success at the helm at Gosforth (Cup wins in 1976 and
1977), he has won 11 trophies since 1984 (four league titles in six years;
seven cup victories out of 10) at Bath.
After Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, took his club Randwick to five Sydney
premiership titles he became national coach. Rowell has not had such luck.
He has only just been re-admitted to the inner sanctum at Twickenham. Last
year Rowell took the England B side to New Zealand. This year he was shunned
and did not accompany the England A side to Canada in the close season
(where England lost a test to Canada for the first time). This was a
disgrace.
Three weeks ago, Rowell was given back the England A side and will prepare
it for the battle against the All Blacks at Gateshead on November 7. Rowell
should have his sights set on succeeding Geoff Cooke, the England manager,
after the 1995 World Cup and Bath know they must find a successor.
The favourite is Stuart Barnes, the England fly half, but he said: 'It's not
for me. It's natural that people should speculate that as I have been
associated with most of Bath's successes of the last decade that when I
retire I would want to take on Jack's role. But, I see it very differently.'
The balance of power in the club is changing. Many of those who have run the
club for the past four decades have found recent changes hard to accept.
Several were forced to resign at an extraordinary general meeting this
summer.
Roger Berry, a former chairman and player, said: 'The way rugby is going it
is inevitable that there are two heads to a club, the administration which
makes it possible for the game to be played at all levels right down to
minis, and the coaching and playing staff who create our success on the
field.
'It's clear that most senior clubs will have a chief executive officer
before the decade is out. The game is simply so big. No individual can run
the club. It's a 24-hour, seven days a week business and it has to be
professionally managed.'
'The problem,' said John Roberts, a former chairman and ckub captain, 'is
that a paid officer cannot vote under the existing rules of most clubs and
so might feel hemmed in. The ideal scenario would be two paid officials -
one who is head of administration and the other who is head of coaching but
they would be answerable to the executive committee of the club.'
Such a development would mean clubs having to pay Pounds 80,000 in salaries
which in turn means they would have to be turning over Pounds 800,000
(assuming a 10 per cent profit). Bath is not in that position.
Colin Gale, the recently retired honorary treasurer, said: 'Bath made a
profit of Pounds 35,000 after depreciation in 1989, less in 1990, a loss of
just under Pounds 5,000 in 1991 and a Pounds 55,000 profit in 1992. I doubt
if it will be more in 1993 because we were knocked out of the Pilkington
Cup.' The turnover of the club in 1992, net of VAT, was Pounds 450,000.
Bath is a small city with a population of 80,000. The ground could hold many
more than the 8,000 who regularly cram into its tight borders.
Bath's success has meant they have not had to enter the 'transfer' market.
Most of its players are local and in a previous decade would have gone more
naturally to near neighbours Bristol or farther up the road to Gloucester or
Newport. Those who have come from afar include Tony Swift from Swansea, Ben
Clarke from Bishop's Stortford, via Saracens, Victor Ubogu from Richmond (he
lives in London and travels down to Bath three times a week) and Stuart
Barnes and Jon Webb who both came from Bristol.
The rest - Guscott, Hall, Reed, Chilcott, Sole, Halliday and so on - were
drawn from the club's hinterland. Rumours abound that somehow the players
are either given incentives or paid. This was denied by Gale: 'We have to
send our audited accounts to Somerset RFU and they have raised the
occasional comment with respect to players expenses mainly in the region of
medical expenses (Pounds 25,000 in 1992) and travel expenses (Pounds 35,000
in 1992). But they have always confirmed to the RFU that our accounts are in
order.'
'The point is,' said Barnes 'that we do spend money on our preparation.
'Every one wants to beat us and most weeks our games are like an FA Cup
final for our opponents. This year with home and away in the Courage league
this will be heightened farther. For away games we leave Bath on Friday
afternoon and stay overnight in a quality hotel so that we are ready
mentally and physically the next day. (Away expenses, for all the club's
four senior and many youth teams, were Pounds 33,000 in 1992) There simply
isn't any other way to stay on top. We must be as professional prepared as
any first class athlete.'

FOOTBALL: European Champions League, November 23, IFK Gothenburg v
Manchester United.
Walloped 4-0 by Barcelona in their last game in Europe, United need to win
this one if they are to stand a good chance of reaching the knock-out stage
of the competition. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss the match,
after injuring a back muscle in the warm-up before Saturday's 3-0 win over
Crystal Palace - a victory that took United to the top of the Premiership.
Schmeichel was replaced by third-choice 'keeper Kevin Pilkington, but Gary
Walsh, who kept goal in the Nou Camp massacre, has recovered from a stomach
problem and will be fit for Wednesday. Too much was read into the Barcelona
defeat. The last time there was so much talk about English football lagging
the game elsewhere in Europe, it preceded a run in which Liverpool,
Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa totally dominated the European Cup.
                          *      *      *
CRICKET: Australia v England, Novemeber 25-29, 1st Test, Brisbane
Their performance was 'pathetic.' So said the normally mild-mannered England
team manager, Keith Fletcher, describing the tourists' dismal showing
against an Australian XI (effectively a second national team of Test
hopefuls) at the weekend - the final game before the first Test begins on
Friday at the Gabba. Captain Mike Atherton agreed: 'We really haven't played
well.' But Damien Martyn, Australian XI captain, yesterday refused to write
off England in the upcoming Ashes series. 'They will still worry Australia,'
he predicted. 'Graeme Hick and Graham Gooch look like being major forces for
them and I rate both Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton.'
Australia name their Test team today and, despite a glowing reference from
Martyn, fast bowler Merv Hughes could miss out on selection. One of the main
discussion points among the Australian selectors has been whether to recall
Hughes, after he missed the recent tour of Pakistan. Hughes took 3-46 in
England's first innings on Saturday, but is likely to be edged out of
contention this week by Damien Fleming, Glenn McGrath and Craig McDermott,
all of whom toured Pakistan.
                          *      *      *
RUGBY UNION: Wales v South Africa, November 26, Cardiff.
The repercussions of South Africa's violent clash with Neath are still
rumbling in Wales, and the Welsh Rugby Union is to study two videos of the
match at a meeting tonight in a bid to resolve the matter. However, the
Springboks will now have their minds on higher things. Francois Pienaar's
side answered several questions when they beat Scotland 34-10 at Murrayfield
on Saturday. They may be less eye-catching than
Australia, less disciplined than England or New Zealand and less spontaneous
than the French, but collectively they look a match for anybody.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sport: The revolution reaches Dursley - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS AGO, I played a few games of rugby for Dursley, the town where I grew
up, halfway between Cheltenham and Bristol.
My brother appeared for the first team. I struggled into the seconds when no
one was looking and you get an idea of how improbable, though enjoyable, it
must have been when I say that I played both hooker and full back, not to
mention positions in between, in my dizzy spell in the colours of Dursley.
Then, as now, Gloucestershire was a hotbed of rugby. Bristol and Gloucester
were as friendly as rival politicians and the Forest of Dean and Lydney were
places you went to only with a police guard. A middle level existed for
teams such as Stroud. And then you came down to the Dursleys of this world.
It was pretty coarse rugby even though we did not have to carry the posts
out on to the pitch to play.
The changing rooms were in the local Memorial Hall which was not a hall at
all but a glorified tin shed on the edge of the pitch. We did not have a
headquarters. A local publican, who was Welsh and, ergo, interested in
rugby, used to look after us.
At this time kicking to touch was allowed from anywhere on the field. As a
result play was a lot less open. The peel had become fashionable. Forwards,
the donkeys, were beginning to be expected to do more than jump at a
line-out and shove at a scrum. At Dursley, tactics were mentioned and ploys
thought up even though we were not well equipped to bring them off. We were
true amateurs, teachers, scientists, farmers, men for whom rugby was a
relaxation to be played on Saturday afternoons and it was not taken very
seriously.
All this came back to me last week when I spoke to John Darlaston, the
secretary of Dursley, to find out what preparations had been made for the
new season and how it had begun.
'The big change lately has been that we rebuilt our changing rooms and club
room during the summer,' he said. 'We did it using our own labour for little
more than Pounds 20,000. We get sponsored to the tune of Pounds 6,000 or
Pounds 7,000 each year and we need to have somewhere to entertain them.'
Sponsors were unheard of in my day and the only entertaining that went on
was when Fred Wilcox told his agricultural jokes.
Dursley run four teams and have about 75 playing members. 'We even managed
to lend the opposition nine players for a fourth team game last season,'
said Darlaston.
Then he said something that really brought home the difference between then
and now: 'Training began in the fourth week of June. We've been at it two
nights a week ever since.' From what I remember, training was fairly
haphazard. Actually, from what I remember training was non existent. Mine
certainly was. I cannot remember ever doing any. Perhaps that is why I did
not play very often.
Wherever you look in rugby, the talk is of leagues. Heineken have just paid
Pounds 2.1m to the Welsh Rugby Union to sponsor the leagues in Wales for
three more years and the leagues in England receive a similar sum from
Courage. League rugby, as opposed to rugby league, is crucial for the
Harlequins and Baths of this world but even at Dursley's level it has
considerable significance.
'We hope to move up from the third division of the Gloucestershire League to
the second division this season,' said Darlaston. 'We almost did it last
year. The top four went up. We finished fifth only because we couldn't
honour our match fixture against Cainscross.'
Bob Dwyer, the coach of Australia, has said he thinks the new ruck and maul
laws are making the game a combination of rugby league and basketball. That
was not a consideration down in Gloucestershire. 'The lads were a bit
shocked when they watched the All Blacks push the South Africans back 40
yards and then not get the put-in at the ensuing scrum,' said Darlaston.
'But they are not so concerned about the law itself. They don't think that
at our level it is going to make much difference.'
Dursley in the third division. Who'd have thought it? They have made an
inauspicious start to this, their 40th season, losing two of their first
three games. It has been difficult for their captain, Sid Smith, who was
injured in pre-season training.
'It is a bit tricky trying to generate some fire in the lads from the touch
line,' said Smith, a hooker turned back-row forward.
Good luck to Dursley, particularly this afternoon when they play Imperial
Tobacco from Bristol in the first round of the Provincial Cup, south west
region 2. I remember my time as a paying and playing member with affection.
Those days long before the breathalyser were happy times - Fred Wilcox's
jokes and all.

Tomorrow: US baseball play-offs.
These should have started, but they won't, because of the players' strike
and the owners' cancellation of the season.
Baseball's enlarged, TV-friendly, eight-team play-offs were to have started
tomorrow, but no-one will turn up. Result: for the first time since 1904
there will be no World Series winners - just losers.
Golf: October 6-9: Alfred Dunhill Cup, St Andrews Old Course, Scotland.
An end-of-term feeling hangs over St Andrews for the 16-team tournament that
tries to duplicate the nationalist enthusiasm of the Ryder Cup. The cast
keeps changing but Fred Couples, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite are due to play
for the US, the defending champions.
Rugby league: October 5: Leeds vs Australia; October 8: Wigan vs Australia.
Australia, the most muscular operators in the tiny pond of international
rugby league, have arrived in Britain.
Their hosts have arranged the itinerary so that their best players meet the
Kangaroos often and early, softening-up the tourists.
This week Australia play Leeds, whose player-coach Ellery Hanley is the new
Great Britain coach, then Wigan, the world club champions.
Soccer: October 8: European championships: Estonia vs Italy, France vs
Romania, Armenia vs Cyprus. October 9: Latvia vs Portugal, Croatia vs
Lithuania.
Italy were brought down to earth after losing the World Cup final when
drawing with Slovenia in their first European championship qualifier.
They continue their tour of eastern Europe with a visit to Estonia where
their chief adversary will be their old fear of failure. But Italy can
benefit from the knowledge that they cannot top France's collapse in the
World Cup qualifiers in Paris last year.
France lost their last two home games - the second to Bulgaria by two late
goals - to surrender a place in the finals. Eric Cantona (above), now
France's captain, blamed Parisian fans. France play Saturday's game in St
Etienne, where they face erratic Romania, World Cup quarter-finalists, and
the ghosts of recent Balkan humiliations.
Rugby union: October 8: South Africa vs Argentina. Kitch Christie, the
unorthodox new South African coach, makes his debut, shaking-up the back
division and, perhaps, South Africa's traditional approach.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rugby: All Blacks boosted by generosity of hosts - Derek
Wyatt previews the New Zealand tour, which starts today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE All Blacks open their 13-match tour this afternoon at a sold-out
Twickenham against the London and South-East Division. They are,
justifiably, worth their No. 1 status in the world, having disposed of the
British Isles, Western Samoa and Australia earlier in the year.
They will find the London side playing an expansive game which will suit the
likes of Will Carling, Damian Hopley, Chris Oti and Tony Underwood, but it
could stretch Huw Davies' abilities at full-back.
The All Blacks will play it tight, as they have done for the past 100 years.
Theirs is a game predicated on crossing the gain line as close to as many
forwards as possible. It can, therefore, be mind-numbingly boring to watch,
but it is ruthlessly effective.
Only Australia, over the past five years, has managed to beat them, and beat
them well - something they find quite alien. True, South Africa has the best
record against them at international level (23-17), but not in the recent
past and not since neutral referees were introduced.
Australia's success has come from matching the fire and fury of the All
Black forwards, and actually being superior technically in the front and
second rows. This, understandably, has sent shock waves through the New
Zealand community.
But, as well as settling for equality up front, the Wallabies have had a
dominance at half-back, centre and, when Campese is on song, out in the
darkest recesses of the three-quarters.
Will London show us the tactical nous to beat the All Blacks? I doubt it.
While much bar-room talk has been centred on Jeff Probyn's reinstatement in
the front-row, the game will not be won there (besides which, as far as
England is concerned, Vicar Ubogu is now a more complete player). It will be
won by the middle five: that is, the back rows and the half-backs. In these
positions, the All Blacks have the edge.
Of New Zealand's new boys, former All Black fly-half Wayne Smith says: 'Marc
Ellis is outstanding. Perhaps his versatility is a problem but he has
immense potential.' We shall have to wait until mid-week to see him,
however, as Steve Bachop is preferred today at first five-eighth (the New
Zealand term for fly-half; the inside centre is the second five-eighth).
Without Grant Fox, the All Blacks have the potential to play a wider game;
but if they lose their confidence, and if a kicker of goals does not emerge,
they will move inside centre Lee Stensness to fly-half in the Tests. Laurie
Mains, the coach, is a dour man who fears failure.
The tour itinerary leaves some questions unanswered. Why was the Lions tour
to New Zealand 'so murderous' (to quote former All Black captain David
Kirk)? How come the Rugby Football Union has ageed to play five matches in
England without the sixth being the Test match?
Instead, the All Blacks will head north to play three matches against
various Scottish sides before meeting Scotland. That means eight games
before a Test; for England, it will be 10 games before their international.
The authorities are being extraordinarily generous to their visitors.
The answer must be the workings of the four home unions and their tour
committee. With players grumbling already about the demands on them this
season, it does make some kind of sense to move the international season to
April and play it over four successive weekends on both Saturday and Sunday.
(In New Zealand, the provincial championship does just this).
This must be on the minds of sport executives at the BBC, ITV and Sky, the
three companies pitching for the television rights to rugby for 1994 and
beyond. Indeed, Geoff Cooke, the England manager, earlier this month called
the Five Nations championship too incestuous and suggested including Romania
and Canada).
If rugby is to become global, then some of its tradition must be re-shaped;
after all, the Derby is to move to a Saturday. The Five Nations should
become the Ten Nations and embrace America, Italy, Romania, Canada and Spain
in two leagues, with promotion and relegation. This would truly benefit
northern hemisphere rugby.
In essence, the problem for England is that it has become too successful. It
does not need the protection of the four home unions. It could have its own
more lucrative television contract. It could certainly demand that, in
future, it plays three Tests on tours against South Africa, Australia or New
Zealand - something the present understanding prevents it from doing.
By default, the existing set-up favours the incoming tourists. How typically
British.

Soccer: October 12. Friendly: England v Romania.
Matthew Le Tissier is hotly tipped to make his full England debut in this
match. Southampton's gifted forward has so far been limited to substitute
appearances for his country. But injuries to England internationals Darren
Anderton (Tottenham) and David Platt (Sampdoria) mean Le Tissier is likely
to start the game.
'Darren and David have been influential figures since I took over,'
England's manager Terry Venables said last week. 'But he (Le Tissier) has
started the season superbly; he is more impressive than ever.'
The evening also sees European championship games in which Scotland are at
home to the Faroe Islands and Wales away to Moldova. Other European
championship games on October 12: Austria v Northern Ireland, Republic of
Ireland v Liechtenstein, Denmark v Belgium, Macedonia v Spain, Turkey v
Iceland, Switzerland v Sweden, Ukraine v Slovenia, Greece v Finland, Russia
v San Marino, Malta v Czech Republic, Belarus v Luxembourg, Norway v

Netherlands v Germany.

Rugby union: October 12, Wales v Italy (World Cup ranking game), Cardiff.
October 15, South Africa v Argentina, Johannesburg.
Italy, an improving rugby nation, takes on one whose recent revival seems to
have faltered. The Italians beat Romania easily in an earlier match in the
group, while Wales only scraped by in Bucharest - a win which was typical of
recent victories, encouraging but narrow.
Since then Wales have lost skipper Ieuan Evans, the match winner against
Romania, to injury, and Scott Quinnell, their energetic back-row forward, to
rugby league.
                        *      *      *
Golf: October 13-16, World Matchplay, Wentworth.
Severiano Ballesteros, who has won the event five times, was spurned when
invitations were first handed out. The insult seems to have inspired a
return to form. He is in as a replacement for John Daly and the weekend
promises the entertaining sight of Ballesteros trying to extract revenge for
the slight by humiliating everyone concerned.
                        *      *      *
Motor racing: October 16, European Grand Prix, Jerez, Spain.
Two more slighted heroes return. Michael Schumacher (Benetton), banned for
the last two races, holds only a one-point lead over Damon Hill, even though
Hill has not beaten Schumacher this season in any race in which both have
finished. And Nigel Mansell returns from IndyCar racing in the US for the
last three grands prix of the season. Mansell, the 1992 world champion, will
join Hill in the Williams team, and will want to show he is still
competitive in a Formula One car.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Sport: Gloucester glory fades into crisis - Rugby Union /
John Hopkins chronicles the decline of a club that has failed to keep pace
with progress and faces relegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN the years, watching Gloucester play rugby at home has offered several
pleasures. They nearly always won at their beloved ground, Kingsholm, and it
is so close to the city centre. When covering a match there, the routine is
to park in the cattle market or near the cathedral, lunch at Moran's, and
then stroll to Kingsholm to see the elver-eaters consume another hapless
victim.
Sadly, though, this last ingredient has not been available this season.
Moran's flourishes, the cathedral remains a brooding presence and the
spectators are as partisan as ever. But Gloucester, for years one of the
strongest clubs in England, are in crisis. In the Courage leagues, the first
half of which ended last Saturday, Gloucester have tumbled to a position
perilously close to the relegation zone of the first division. The division
is being shrunk to 10 teams next season so four of 13 members will be
relegated this year.
At the start of the season, the clubs that seemed the likeliest relegation
candidates were West Hartlepool and London Scottish, which had come up from
the second division; Rugby, which had just avoided going down; and Bristol
or London Irish. You would never have thought of Gloucester as being in
danger. After all, last season they were semi-finalists in the Cup and
finished fourth in the league. Yet, the unthinkable has happened.
They have played six matches in the league and won only two, the second
being the victory over Saracens at Kingsholm one week ago. They have four
points and are equal ninth with another surprising struggler, Orrell. Last
season, Orrell finished second in the league, level on points with Bath, the
champions. Now, they and Gloucester hover just two points ahead of West
Hartlepool, Saracens and Rugby. Tenth place means relegation.
The troubles at Gloucester began last summer when 12 men, including England
star Mike Teague, left to join rival clubs. Undoubtedly, some of them were
poached, attracted by offers of a better job, a car, money, or some other
inducement. Gloucester officials refuse to dirty their hands in what they
regard as a rather grubby trade. Theirs is a one-sport city and there have
always been plenty of good local players from which to choose. When
Gloucester faced Leicester recently, every player was born within 10 miles
of the cathedral.
'We will not break the rules,' says Keith Richardson, the club coach. 'If
the RFU change the rules then that is a different matter but, at the moment,
we abide by the present rules. If we do not run a centre of local
excellence, who will? Somebody has to. If others have different systems, it
is up to them. It would be a tragedy for rugby union if a club like
Gloucester were stuffed by this sort of thing because the worst kind of
people would then be in the driving seat.'
Gloucester's style of play has, however, been rendered out of date by the
new laws. They have always played to their forwards; but forward dominated
drives, moving upfield in 20-yard surges, do not work now because if the
forwards are stopped and do not release the ball quickly, then a scrum is
awarded to the defending side.
If there is one scene that sums up everything about Gloucester rugby club,
its style of play and its supporters, it is this. Picture a night of stygian
gloom at Kingsholm with rain slashing across the pitch. Gloucester win a
ruck or a line-out and the ball moves to the stand-off, who hoists a
steepling kick. From the 10,000 spectators comes a roar of 'Glaw-ster,
Glaw-ster'. Meanwhile, all the forwards and many of the backs converge on
the man who is trying to catch the ball.
'Gloucester used to be a club you measured yourself against,' says Tony
Russ, the coach of Leicester. 'If you went to Kingsholm and won, that was a
mark of a reasonable side. But that is no longer the case.'
At times like these, of course, everything that happens is for the worse.
Gloucester could have beaten Leicester in September. In spite of having a
player sent off, they fought back from 8-22 to 21-22. Against Wasps a couple
of weeks later, they had territorial superiority, only to lose 14-9. In
fact, they lost each of their league matches by one score. To cap it all, in
beating Saracens they lost Marcus Hannaford, their scrum-half, to a wild
punch. They do not have a reserve. It never rains, it pours.
Even at their best, Gloucester were far from all-conquering away from home.
At Kingsholm, however, they were well-nigh unbeatable. So, although those
losses at Leicester and Wasps hurt, they were as nothing compared with the
home defeat by West Hartlepool, which had lost all its previous league
games.
There were signs of a revival when, first, Welsh club Pontypool and then
South Africa's Transvaal province were defeated. Drastic team changes lay
behind these victories. Out went the entire front row - including Peter
Jones, who had played for Scotland last season - and in came the front row
from the second team, the United. The team that beat Saracens showed seven
changes from the team defeated by West Hartlepool.
When the leagues started in English rugby, they increased the pressure on
first-class clubs. With this season's change in the structure of the
leagues, which means that four clubs go down to the second division, the
pressure is increased even more. Thus, Gloucester look vulnerable.
'We have always said here that as long as we can keep our own players, then
we do not need to worry,' says Peter Ford, the chairman. 'But we lost 12 in
the close season. It may be time to change our policy.'
The leagues start again on January 9 and, in the second half of the season,
Gloucester face London Irish, Northampton and Bristol away and Bath, Orrell
and Harlequins at Kingsholm. They need to win two and probably three of
these games - otherwise, they will be relegated. This does not bear thinking
about. But it could happen if they are unable to come to terms with the
modern game - both its playing and its administration.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Rugby: Botha carries 'Bok hopes - Philip Gawith previews
today's historic Test in Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's athletes are home after a less than triumphant return to the
Olympic Games following an absence of 32 years. Forty-second in the medal
table, with only two silvers, is not the sort of performance to satisfy such
a sports-mad country. .
Today, however, the countlry's rugby players have an opportunity to make
amends when the Springboks - as they are sure to remain known, despite the
efforts of politicians to kill the 'apartheid' designation - meet New
Zealand's All Blacks at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.
It is South Africa's first official rugby Test since they drubbed a weak
English side in 1984, and the first meeting between the two countries since
the protest-wracked 1981 tour of New Zealand by the Springboks.
In terms of national pride, there is a lot at stake for white South Africans
 -relatively few blacks play the game - over the next week. In keeping with
South Africa's generally somewhat breathless return to world sport, the
Springboks are also due to face Australia's world-champion Wallabies in Cape
Town next Saturday.
It is a schedule that ranks with the country's return to international
cricket last year when, with less than a month's notice, the South Africans
travelled to India to play three one-day internationals. They were
outclassed in the first two but won the third handsomely.
A similar pattern for the rugby players would not be unexpected. For a team
that has been out of international rugby for eight years, and which has
never played together, to take on two such powerful and settled combinations
is extraordinarily ambitious, if not foolish.
There is also the matter of rules. South Africans worry that isolation has
bred bad habits - particularly, lifting in the line-outs - which neutral
referees will penalise heavily. Indeed, the Australian official who will
handle today's match has indicated that he will crack down on illegal
line-out tactics.
There are, therefore, alibis in abundance should the national ego take a
pounding over the next week. Even so, Springbok supporters are pinning their
hopes of victory on two factors: home advantage and 34-year-old Naas Botha.
The Springboks can, of course, be beaten at home - the formidable 1974
British Lions proved that - but it is never easy. Botha, however, is
something else.
Almost certainly, the fair-haired fly-half and captain is the most
controversial rugby player South Africa has produced. He made his debut for
Northern Transvaal in 1977, aged 19, and has dominated South African rugby
ever since, apart from a brief period in American football in 1983 as a
kicker for the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots. His involvement in
professional sport caused fierce debate when he was then cleared to resume
his career in the 'amateur' rugby code.
Botha enjoys celebrity status in the Afrikaans media, which dwells lavishly
on his every move. But, despite his phenomenal talents, many rugby followers
outside the Transvaal accord him only grudging respect.
His precocious debut, and later captaincy of Northern Transvaal when they
were near-invincible late in the 1970s and early '80s, won him adulation in
Pretoria but enemies elsewhere.
Much of this was jealousy: rivals resented his match-winning qualities. They
attacked his style of play, criticising him for kicking the game to death
and never tackling. His quick temper did not help: his frequent involvement
in niggling off-the-ball incidents created an image as a poor sportsman.
Botha is certainly no angel, but it is unfortunate that his on-field gifts
have sometimes been obscured by his personality and private life. His
drop-kicking and punting abilities are legendary - testimony to superb
balance and timing - and his tactical sense impeccable.
He also has a well defined instinct of self-preservation. It is likely that
Michael Jones, the speedy All Black flanker, will have the task this
afternoon of trying to stop Botha. If he does not succeed, he can reflect
that other distinguished players, like Ireland's Fergus Slattery and
Jean-Pierre Rives of France, have failed before him.
Today's game and next Saturday's against Australia will be shown live on
ITV.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Pride of Lions with an English accent - John Hopkins
saves the British and Irish selectors the trouble of picking a party to tour
New Zealand / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW morning, those selecting the British Lions' rugby squad to tour New
Zealand this summer will announce their choices. Gentlemen, you need not
bother. I have picked the party for you. Take the day off.
Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the 1993 party is
easier to select than, say, those of 1983 and 1989. Players from England -
which is vying with New Zealand to be the second-best rugby nation in the
world - obviously should form the core of the party.
Some ground rules. First, I am selecting solely on ability. Lions' teams
have been dogged by regional parochialism. Imagine the scene: selectors
representing each of the four home unions gather round the table. As the
composition of the party takes shape, one selector realises that there will
only be a couple of players from his country. This will reflect badly on him
and colours his comments.
Since it is impossible for me to predict these outbursts of chauvinism, I
have ignored them altogether. How nice it would be to think there will be
none and that the best party is chosen.
The new laws have encouraged the up-and-under as an attacking tactic.
Full-backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. Gavin Hastings is
one and so, generally, is Jonathan Webb. And while neither is entirely
reliable with the boot (look at Webb against Wasps last Saturday), there
will be other goal-kickers in the party.
Wings? The Underwood brothers are scorching attackers and deadly finishers.
Ieuan Evans, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good
vice-captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months
ago. The fourth wing is a toss-up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and
Ireland's Simon Geoghegan. Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more
rounded player who can play full-back as well. Since versatility is an asset
on tour, I prefer Hunter.
Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first-choice
partnership in the centre. Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should
go. He is a rock-solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings. I give my nod to
Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de
Glanville.
Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand-off halves as
Carling and Guscott outside them. They complement one another. Barnes has an
edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving. He
demonstrated this brilliantly at Twickenham against Scotland. Andrew is a
doughty competitor and a good goal-kicker. The competition between them will
be keen.
Gary Armstrong is the obvious first choice at scrum-half. Will the other be
Dewi Morris, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or
Robert Jones, the quick-passing technician? Jones could have lost his chance
by operating behind a beaten pack for most of the season. Morris is my
choice.
No. 8? A man like Dean Richards is an essential component of a team in New
Zealand where at least some of the games will be played in mud. His
upper-body strength and ability to tie-up the ball will be invaluable. With
training every day, he should get a bit fitter, too.
If, however, the ground is dry and the game is expected to be fast and
loose, then Ben Clarke would be an acceptable choice at No. 8. He could even
play blindside flanker with Richards at the back.
Is Wade Dooley a spent force? I think not. If there are four better line-out
forwards in the home countries, then I am a Dutchman. He will benefit from
regular competition, which he does not get with Preston Grasshoppers.
Martin Bayfield should go along with Martin Johnson, who is known and
respected in New Zealand. Candidates for the fourth place as a lock include
Gareth Llewellyn, who has blossomed this season as captain of Neath; Neil
Francis of Ireland; and the Scots, Doddie Weir and Damian Cronin. Francis is
my man.
Kenny Milne and Brian Moore are certainties as the hookers, Jeff Probyn and
Jason Leonard as two of the props. I think that Nick Popplewell, the fiery
Irishman, and Paul Burnell of Scotland, should join them.
Flankers? Peter Winterbottom picks himself because he is one of the best in
the world. I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal
workrate on the open-side. Mike Teague is another New Zealand style forward,
a man who blossomed on tour in Australia four years ago and could do so
again this summer. Emyr Lewis was a leading candidate four months ago but
has not played at his best this season. Tim Rodber has come on at
Northampton under the aegis of Wayne Shelford and, like Clarke, could play
either at No 8 or flanker. He deserves a chance.
Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the
captaincy. It is true that Carling is the most successful captain in world
rugby. But that does not take in to account that he does not seem entirely
at ease with it and, more to the point, what goes with it  - the media and
all that. Hastings manages to do both with less apparent discomfort.
It might be a horrible mistake or it might be a moment of inspired thinking
to make Hastings the captain and give Carling a break from captaincy to
concentrate entirely on his own game. I plump for Hastings.
So there you are Lions' selectors, I have done the job for you in half the
time and at no cost. The party comprises 21 Englishmen, five Scots, two
Welshmen and two Irishmen. I must now duck my Irish and Welsh friends and
colleagues for having picked only two men from their country but I did say I
would select strictly on merit.
Thus the composition of my party is (English unless otherwise stated): G
Hastings, (Scotland) capt, J Webb, R Underwood, T Underwood, I Evans,
(Wales), I Hunter, W Carling, J Guscott, S Gibbs (Wales), S Hastings,
(Scotland) S Barnes, R Andrew, G Armstrong (Scotland), D Morris, J Probyn, J
Leonard, N Popplewell (Ireland), P Burnell (Scotland), B Moore, K Milne
(Scotland), W Dooley, M Bayfield, M Johnson, N Francis (Ireland), P
Winterbottom, N Back, M Teague, T Rodber, B Clarke, D Richards.

RUGBY UNION: England v Romania, November 12, Twickenham
There have been two talking points in rugby union over the last week. The
first was England's new manager and coach, Jack Rowell (see People Page),
backing down over his demand that his squad of players should not turn out
for their clubs on the Saturday before international matches. The second was
the oh-so-sharp pen of former England stand-off Stuart Barnes. Comments in
Barnes' recently-published autobiography led to England hooker Brian Moore
starting libel proceeding, and accepting a Pounds 4,000 out-of-court
settlement. Then, in his Daily Telegraph column, Barnes caused a furore by
claiming that England captain Will Carling was not pulling his weight at
Harlequins and should be replaced by Philip de Glanville in the England
side. Supporters are waiting to see how Carling responds in the first of six
matches that England play before next year's World Cup in South Africa.
MOTOR RACING: Australian Grand Prix, November 13, Adelaide.
One race left and one point in it. Damon Hill's win in yesterday's
rain-soaked, crash-riddled Japanese Grand Prix means that the 34-year-old
Londoner goes to Australia trailing Germany's Michael Schumacher by the
narrowest of margins in the race for the championship. Schumacher is still
considered to be the best driver around. But so was Jim Clark when Damon's
father beat him for the world crown.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Sport: Jersey that built a team - Derek Wyatt visits an
ambitious club with luxurious facilities / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT, the club's four top XVs trained until late. Each team had been
designated one of the four floodlit training pitches. There was a coach and
a team manager watching each side go through its paces for Sunday's games.
Other facilities on the club's 45-acre site include a sports shop, a
restaurant and bar, full-time medical support, accommodation, beach
volleyball, tennis, a golf range, and a basketball and volleyball arena.
After training, the first XV held an impromptu karaoke evening with wine,
cheese and salami provided by club stalwarts.
This morning, the forwards will go through some line-outs at the main
ground. When the side assembles for brunch tomorrow at an exclusive tennis
club, the players will mentally rehearse their play and discuss the
opposition. They will then make their way to their ninth league game of the
season knowing that a loss will deprive them of the leadership of the first
division.
The club is A S Benetton Rugby TV. The TV stands for Treviso, a small,
elegant town near Venice. Benetton, as it is more familiarly known, would
sit easily in the first division of the Courage League in England.
Its facilities are the best in the world. When I watched Benetton earlier in
the season against Milan, the team played a fluid and intelligent game
although it struggled in the line-outs. At the start of the season, Benetton
beat Gloucester at home; last year, the club lost by three points to Bath.
Being so closely identified with Benetton poses problems. Benetton is
Treviso. It has grown from a small clothing venture into a global brand and,
along the way, the family has grown and accommodated similar business
cultures including Nordica (ski clothing and ski boots), Prince (squash and
tennis), Siseley (leisure clothing), Nitro (golf balls), andLangert and
Grafalloy (golf clubs).
The assumption is that Benetton Rugby is flush with money, that all its
players are lire millionaires, and that there is a benefactor who will pay
until success arrives. This is not the case.
Fabrisio Gaetaniello, capped 39 times by Italy and its captain from
1974-1983, is the sports director for rugby at the club: 'Our contract with
Benetton is renewed annually with Luciano, one of the three Benetton
brothers. They are not our only sponsors but they do give us somewhere in
the region of L700m (Pounds 290,000) each year, about a half of what we need
to run our club.
'But we have nine or 10 sides each week. We have a fully fledged schools
programme in the region and supply coaches and coaching to eight of them;
we're dealing with 300 juniors from the age of seven and upwards.
'Plus, we have a newish stadium to support. We have built two stands to hold
12,000 spectators and we have plans to develop further.'
Success is what Benetton TV craves and it has been prepared to go to the
market place and attract the best coaches and players. Until 1992, its coach
was Pierre Villepreux; under him, the club won the championship.
The new coach is Wayne Smith, a former All Black fly-half. He has immersed
himself in the local culture and can speak and correspond in Italian. (The
Italian Rugby Federation has just appointed a French coach to the national
side who cannot speak a word of Italian). In Smith's first season, Benetton
lost the championship final to Milan, its arch-rival, for which David
Campese used to play - he has now been replaced by Jason Little.
'In New Zealand, so much of rugby is automatically inherent. Here in Italy,
there isn't that tradition,' said Smith. 'Rugby is not 100 per cent in their
culture even though, in Treviso, it is the main sport.
'My job is to create a winning side and, at the same time, plan the supply
of future generations of local players. The locals love the game here and it
is the main topic of conversation at the bars. At the same time, although
they talk fondly about it, they might struggle to know where the hooker
plays.
'As a consequence, although we are allowed only two overseas players per
team, they always occupy the decision-making positions. We have Michael
Lynagh returning to us this week and I brought in Rob Penney, the Auckland
No 8, to bring some dynamics to the forwards.'
Talk of Lynagh invariably raises the question about how much players from
the southern hemisphere are paid to play in the north.
'Michael is not paid by Benetton Rugby club,' said Smith. 'And, when John
Kirwan played for us, he also was not paid, either. I have read that these
players are on contracts with us at so much a game. This is absolute
nonsense. JR did not play in the first Test against the Lions because he
wanted to play for us in the final against Milan.'
Kirwan, who is married to an Italian - Lynagh is about to follow suit - has
a business in Treviso; Lynagh works for the main company, Benetton, in
public relations. Is this any different from all those English and Welsh
first division players who hold nebulous positions in 'public relations'? I
am not sure how 'jobs for the boys' translates in Italian, but this is how
all the leading clubs in the world now work.
Smith's wish is that the Italian clubs become involved in the planning of a
European league.
'We need more sides from the UK and France to play us,' he said. 'After all,
it is quicker to travel to London, Cardiff or Edinburgh than it is to play
Catania in Sicily.'
This, and the need for an overhaul of the Italian league structure so that
it is more competitive, is what keeps Smith involved. When he returns home,
you can be sure the club will continue to think big. My guess is that Bob
Dwyer, Australia's coach, will top their list.
Llanelli has provoked the Welsh and English rugby unions to open discussions
for an Anglo-Welsh league. This would be the saviour of club rugby in Wales.
It would not offer the big English clubs sufficient incentives, nor enough
fixtures of merit. England must look to the continent of Europe as well. It
is a European Cup, including French and Italian clubs with the English and
Welsh, that is required.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Sport: The turnover law that needs to be scrapped - Rugby
Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of appearances to the contrary, Twickenham was not full for
Tuesday's Varsity match. One seat was left empty when the ticket-holder, who
gets vertigo, discovered the height of the west stand's upper tier. She
retired to the car park and listened on the radio.
Perhaps she was the lucky one. The rest of us had to endure one of the
poorest Varsity matches since the mid-1960s - as poor, incidentally, as the
scratchy recording of the national anthem that was played before the start.
The Varsity match merits more than a worn recording. Why not a a band?
My main complaint centres not on the standard of play but the style, which
was a direct result of the new laws - especially, the turnover law. I left
my (Oxford) seat with a deep sense of disappointment.
The first I saw of the new laws was at Aberavon on a sunny afternoon last
September when Cardiff were the visitors. The home club had printed a list
of the changes as explained by Clive Norling, the referee. There were more
than 20 of them.
Cardiff won comfortably enough but Aberavon once caught their opponents
napping with a quickly-taken throw-in that almost resulted in a try. The
opportunism this law change was meant to encourage was evident.
Since then, I have seen one game each Saturday and a few in midweek as well.
It is clear that most of the changes are working well. The experimental
line-out variation, which says the catcher must use both hands or his inside
arm to grab the ball, is sensible: it stops players levering themselves up
on rivals' shoulders. I am glad, too, that the scrum-half can no longer dart
away from a scrum in a dummy move.
On the other hand, the turnover law has not worked at all well. It says: 'In
a maul when the ball becomes unplayable, the team not in possession at the
start of the maul will put the ball in to the ensuing scrummage.' It quickly
became known as the 'use it or lose it' law and, in principle, it seemed
sensible. Its aim was to encourage teams to ruck or maul the ball back more
quickly, so that play would be more dynamic.
In drafting this law, the International Board were accepting the perceived
wisdom that there is a New Age of rugby. The game is undergoing a
renaissance in style and popularity now that it has become a running,
handling affair in which forwards run like backs and backs tackle like
forwards.
Rugby is growing in popularity, for players and spectators, in a way it has
not done since, nearly 30 years ago, kicking to touch was banned from
outside your own 22.
Yet, on the evidence of this season in Europe, the turnover law has done the
opposite of what was intended. Teams get into their opponents' territory and
kick the ball high in the air as an attacking ploy, rather than run at them
and risk conceding the put-in at a scrum.
Furthermore, it encourages the defending side's back row to stand off at
rucks so they are ready to move around the field and end attacks. This means
that games become stop-start. In those I have watched this season, not one
has contained sustained attacking rugby.
The greatest try I have seen was scored by the Lions in South Africa in
1980. The ball went through 32 pairs of hands and the movement lasted 96
seconds before Mike Slemen, the wing, touched down.
Under the present turnover law, it would not have happened. The referee
would have blown up at the first ruck, after 14 seconds, and given a scrum
to the home side.
Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, hates the turnover law because it is
stifling initiative. Lyn Evans, the Oxford coach, said after Tuesday's loss:
'The game has less shape and pattern to it now.' It was not sour grapes.
Tony Rodgers, the long-time coach of Cambridge, agrees. 'Players are
stacking up in midfield. No wonder you can't get attacking moves going. You
have got to suck in the forwards, make them do their jobs of winning the
ball.'
Grappling for the ball in a maul, or getting it back with the feet in a
ruck, are legitimate skills of the game. Sadly, they have been devalued by
the turnover law, which encourages opponents to kill the ball because they
know they will get the put-in at the ensuing scrum. Thus, rugby is becoming
more defensive at a time when it is trying hard to do the opposite.
Fortunately, the turnover law is not written in stone; it is an experiment.
The IB will review it in the spring. My advice is succinct: scrap it and go
back to the old law.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Sport: Put through the ringer - Rugby Union / Tom Fort once
smuggled an All Black star into his Sunday team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the sights of the recent All Blacks' tour of Britain was the mighty
winger, Vai'aiga Tuigamala, a terrifying man, who felicitously combines the
destructive potential of a medieval battering ram with intelligence and
finesse of the highest order. Even in the All Blacks' sole defeat, by
England at Twickenham, there was one moment to savour.
The victim was the younger Underwood. As he took a high kick outside the
England 22, he was picked up by Tuigamala, in the manner of a splintered
tree trunk being shifted by a JCB. He finally hit the turf 15 yards back,
and tottered away, ruefully massaging his flanks.
Had the International Rugby Board's regulations on national qualification
been other than a standing joke, Underwood would not have had to suffer so.
For Tuigamala is hardly more of a New Zealander than I am a Frenchman. He is
a Samoan. He is not alone. The ranks of the two great southern hemisphere
sides are bursting with South Sea islanders. Apart from Tuigamala, the All
Blacks have Frank Bunce, Steve Bachop and Eroni Clarke from Samoa. Australia
have the indestructible Tongan, Willie Ofahengaue, and the Fijian flanker,
Ilie Tabua.
The Europeans are not above such shenanigans. Remember the hoots when former
Aussie Brian Smith pulled on the green shirt of Ireland - which turned to
howls when he left his adopted country in the lurch just before the World
Cup. By name, Damien Cronin may sound like a resident of Tannochbrae. But by
any meaningful criteria, he is English, as are his fellow Scots, Andy Reed
and Neil Edwards.
Nigel Redman, Jonathon Callard, Stuart Barnes and Simon Halliday of England
are all Welsh born. Tony Copsey of Wales is an Essex man with a 'Made in
England' tattoo.
Whatever the contortions over birthplace, citizenship and grandparental
domicile, these men are - to employ a colloquialism - ringers. And as the
longtime organiser of a rugby team which was ever oppressed by the need to
find 15 players, I am all for them. Gather thy bodies wherever thou mayest
is my motto - with one proviso, which I shall come to later.
Of course, there is a limit to the influence a ringer can wield. If the team
is useless, he will not be able to transform it into something else. One
Sunday, many years ago, the Welsh and British Lions winger, Clive Rees, was
strolling around the pitch on which we were about to play formidable
opposition. As usual, we were deficient in numbers, and the obliging Rees
was talked into helping out. I suspect he regretted it. We lost 54-0, and
not once were we broken-winded, clapped-out forwards able to secure the ball
for him to use of his greyhound pace.
I prefer to recall another occasion. We had progressed from the Rees era,
and were a reasonable side. But our opponents were better, and knew it. We
longed to puncture their air of superiority.
We had a Kiwi playing for us that season. He was called Rex Smith, and he
had played for Otago and was well-connected. We told him how keen we were to
beat this outfit for the first time, and he said he would speak to some
mates. On the evening in question he produced his two recruits. One
introduced himself as Earle - Earle Kirton, the former All Blacks number
eight (and currently the assistant coach). The other was called Sapsford. He
was a prop, 18st plus, and could run faster than anyone in our back
division.
It was he who did the damage. He took the ball, and thundered at them like a
buffalo with a mission. Their defence was demolished like brushwood, leaving
casualties stretched out on the ground. We scored. They kicked off, Sapsford
caught the ball and off we went again. It was murder, and the greatest fun.
The atmosphere in the bar afterwards was charged. They were subdued, we were
riotous. There were recriminations, which became increasingly bitter when
Kirton was identified. Our sportmanship was questioned, the future of the
fixture put in doubt. But the crosser they became, the more we smirked. They
had never thought much of us, but the worm had turned, and we had - to put
it crudely - stitched them up.
And that brings me to the condition I mentioned earlier. Yes, I believe the
game is richer for ringers, and it has been a privilege to see Tuigamala in
his pomp. But life is undoubtedly more comfortable if you make sure that
they are on your side.

FT  15 FEB 92 / Sport: They're lean and mean - Rugby Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN THE years there have been good England rugby teams and less good ones.
England's team in the current Five Nations' Championship is the best ever.
They proved that in the second half against Scotland and throughout the
memorable game against Ireland in which they scored six tries. Their
performance at Twickenham two weeks ago was remarkable because Ireland won
50 per cent of the possession and had the put-in at 15 of the game's 21
scrums. The mind boggles at what England might have done with more
possession.
If Will Carling's team beat France in Paris this afternoon, as they should,
and go on and win the Grand Slam, as they should, they will have proved
themselves the best European team in the international championships for at
least 30 years.
How they have done this is instructive. They have based their methods on
those of a successful club. A squad system was introduced and a team
manager, Geoff Cooke, appointed. Cooke has brought stability and consistency
to team selection. They were not always present before.
Cooke has also introduced mental training techniques. When he gave tapes for
mental rehearsal to Paul Rendall and Jeff Probyn, England's props, he
received a dusty answer. He did not give up however. Prior to the Irish game
he asked every player to write down six reasons why they wanted to play for
England and six reasons that motivated them to their best performances. Even
a seemingly simple exercise such as this had a benefit: it helped the
players concentrate their minds on the task in hand.
The most significant reason for England's surge forward is their dedication
to fitness. England's players are fitter than ever and whether or not they
bring home the bacon in the form of the grand slam this season, this
achievement can not be taken away from them. They are 25 per cent fitter
than Wales's, believes Alan Davies, Wales's coach, and much fitter than
Ireland's, too.
England tried to improve their fitness as long ago as the mid-1970s. It did
not work then any more than did the practice of having the selectors in
track suits on the pitch at training sessions, not to mention Larry Lamb,
the referee, Don Rutherford, a doctor and a physiotherapist and one or two
other well-minded but misguided England camp followers.
'I was told I had to run six miles in 48 minutes and be able to do ten 150
yard sprints each in 18 seconds,' recalls one England international of that
vintage. 'What use was that to me? It would not increase my speed over 30
yards and that was what I needed, explosive speed not stamina. Anyway the
senior players put an end to it. We were supposed to be tested at Aldershot
and only the scrum-halves and a couple of other backs turned up. The senior
players all refused.'
In 1986, McNab returned to work with the England squad and his principles
are now followed. A number of England players recently achieved oxygen
uptake figures measuring the capacity of the heart and lungs that would have
been respectable for highly-trained athletes. Although their weight and body
size have increased, body fat has diminished, in some cases to proportions
almost as low as marathon runners. England's rugby players are not just
mean, they're lean, too.
Rugby throws up famous players in groups of two or three: Mesnel and Sella
currently representing France, for example; Price, Windsor and Faulkner, the
Pontypool Front Row, for Wales in the 1970s; Marques and Currie, the England
locks of nearly 40 years ago.
A considerable part of England's current success is due to the centre
partnership of Carling and Guscott. Concentrate on one and the other is
away. They are fast in attack and strong in defence and two better centres
have not played together for England.
They are the heart of a potent three-quarter line. As other countries have
found to their cost, concentrate on Guscott and Carling and England wings
Halliday and Underwood, will go on a spree and, if they do not then Webb
will, as he did two weeks ago. As he surveyed the wreckage of his Irish team
at Twickenham Ciaran Fitzgerald observed: 'England's back division had
everything you could ask for - speed,teamwork and strength. They had a great
ability to penetrate, not with one single player but in numbers.'
There have been two mould-breaking British teams in the past 21 years. The
first was the 1971 British Lions, the first Lions to win a series in New
Zealand, and the second was the 1974 British Lions, who went unbeaten
through a Test series in South Africa. This current England team should be
regarded as mould breakers, too.

Rugby League. October 22, Great Britain v Australia, first John Smith's
Test, Wembley.
It was a shock, in 1982, when the fitness and technical ability of
Australia's touring side took British rugby league by surprise. This year
their style of play has been a shock too, for the Kangaroos' machine-like
qualities - grinding down opposition attacks and ruthlessly punishing
mistakes - have played second fiddle to fluent attacking rugby. So far they
have moved the ball so often and at such speed that, despite an
uncharacteristic number of handling errors, they have swept aside the
strongest club sides in Britain. The question is: will they continue this
swashbuckling approach at Wembley or revert to error-free football. Great
Britain, who proved their strength last
year with victory over New Zealand, have brought in Wigan's Shaun Edwards as
captain - a blow for Garry Schofield of Leeds who lost the job just two
Tests short
of equalling Mick Sullivan's
record of 46 appearances for his country.
Football. Uefa Cup, October 18, Trabzonspor v Aston Villa. European Cup,
October 19, Manchester United v Barcelona. European Cup Winners' Cup,
October 20, Brondby v Arsenal and Chelsea v Austria Vienna.
Johan Cruyff threatens 'all-out attack' by Barcelona when they visit
Manchester United in the European Champions' League. In truth they have
little choice: Barcelona, initially the bookmakers' favourites to win
United's qualifying group, surprisingly lost their previous game to
Gothenburg and now lie third in the table. As for United, manager Alex
Ferguson is not taking the threat lightly. 'Their names, that's the mental
thing we've got to conquer,' he says. 'We've all got a thing about names.
Romario, Stoichkov, Hagi - you are more frightened of the names than what
they actually do.'
In the Cup Winners' Cup, Arsenal are away to Brondby, of Denmark, while
Chelsea are at home to FK Austria Vienna. Arsenal swapped home and away
dates to avoid their fans travelling to Europe at the same time and on
almost an identical route to Chelsea's.
After their memorable victory over holders Internazionale Milan in the last
round of the Uefa Cup, Aston Villa travel to Trabzonspor of Turkey.
Boxing. October 23, WBO heavyweight title, Herbie Hide v Tommy Morrison; WBO
middleweight title, Steve Collins v Lonny Besley; IBF lightweight title,
Rafael Ruelas v Billy Schwer; non-title fight, Frank Bruno v Ray Mercer.
Hong Kong.
When Oliver McCall took Lennox Lewis's WBC world title last month, McCall's
promoter, Don King, once again gained virtual control of the profitable
world heavyweight title business. King's first move against the Lewis camp
was to announce that McCall may defend his crown against Lewis's old British
rival, Frank Bruno. It would be Bruno's fourth attempt at winning a world
crown. But he must first beat Ray Mercer, who once stopped Tommy Morrison,
the challenger for Herbie Hide's WBO title on the same Hong Kong bill.
