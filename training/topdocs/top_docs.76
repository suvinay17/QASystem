   A businessman was named a special Sioux
chief Saturday and pledged to unite Indians to regain land they
lost after gold was discovered, although some Sioux believe he is
``impersonating an Indian.''
   ``I promise you I will carry the battle lance of our people ...
until the Black Hills are once again ours forever more,'' Phillip
J. Stevens, of Irvine, Calif., told a crowd of more than 600 people
who attended a ceremony at the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation.
   Stevens, who wore fringed buckskins decorated with Indian
beadwork, was given a shield and headdress made of imitation eagle
feathers and the name Man Who Walks With The Shield. He could not
receive real eagle feathers under federal law because he is not an
enrolled member of a Sioux tribe.
   The plan to make Stevens a special chief to lead the land battle
was pushed by members of the Grey Eagle Society, a group of Sioux
elders, and other traditional-minded Indians.
   Chieftainships are unrelated to the legal governance of a tribe,
which under federal law is done by an elected president and council.
   At the ceremony, Stevens smoked a sacred pipe with Oglala Sioux
Chief Oliver Red Cloud, Northern Cheyenne Chief Austin Two Moons of
Montana and other leaders after singing and praying.
   ``We seek to injure no one in South Dakota. We only seek the
return of lands that are rightfully owned by the Lakota (Sioux)
people,'' Stevens told reporters.
   ``They (the Black Hills) are sacred to the Sioux people. They
are our altar to God. ... It is like stealing their church,'' he
said of the rugged area of western South Dakota.
   The federal government signed a treaty in 1868 saying 7.3
million acres of the region belonged to the Sioux, but then
abrogated the treaty and took the land after gold was found in the
Black Hills.
   Stevens supports a bill that would give the Sioux over 1 million
acres plus money, but says more money is necessary to improve
living conditions on reservations where unemployment reaches 85
percent.
   However, not all Sioux believe Stevens has earned the right to
become a special chief, and a historian said it's an unprecedented
title. Some argued Stevens was not an enrolled member of any Sioux
tribe and has not substantiated his claim to be a great-grandson of
Sioux warrior Standing Bear.
   Opponents also said he is splitting the Indian community and
could damage efforts to regain the land.
   On Friday, the Black Hills Sioux Nation Treaty Council filed for
a temporary restraining order in federal court in Rapid City to
make Stevens prove he is of Indian descent or stop making the
claim. The council advises the eight Sioux tribal councils on
treaty issues.
   The complaint said Stevens ``is impersonating an Indian,
claiming Indian heritage that is questionable.''
   No ruling was expected until sometime this week at the earliest.
   Stevens said at Saturday's news conference that he had given
Sioux leaders an affidavit signed by his father saying Standing
Bear was his great-grandfather. Two members of the Standing Bear
family appeared at the ceremony Saturday to support Stevens.
   Another supporter, Homer Whirlwind Soldier, said at the ceremony
that Stevens would have the status to negotiate with federal
officials for land. ``We send a general in to fight a general, so
we give Mr. Phillip Stevens the symbol of authority.''
   Stevens told reporters that he and other Sioux chiefs will ask
Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel to meet with them and set up a
public hearing on the issue.
   Stevens acknowledged that only one of the seven tribal councils
that support the return of the Black Hills has endorsed his
proposal and the plan to make him a special chief, but he said a
petition signed by Sioux people in South Dakota indicates he is
supported by a majority.
   ``I think that the will of the people has been neglected by the
people elected to do the will of the people,'' Stevens said.
   Stevens is an engineer who played a role in development of the
Minuteman III before he founded Ultrasystems Inc. in Irvine,
Calif., in 1969. He recently sold the $160 million-a-year
engineering company to devote his time to the Black Hills effort.
   Stevens, 58, supports legislation introduced by Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., that would return 1.3 million acres of federal
land in the Black Hills to the Sioux.
   The Black Hills region was deeded to the Sioux in the Fort
Laramie Treaty of 1868. But after gold was discovered by an
expedition led by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, prospectors
swarmed in and the treaty was abrogated in 1877. The Indians were
forced onto reservations in less desirable parts of the state.
   The Supreme Court in 1980 upheld a settlement for the land,
which with interest has grown to nearly $200 million. Most of the
Sioux tribal governments have refused the money, saying they want
the land.
   Bradley's bill would return about 1.3 million of the land
covered by the original treaty. It applies only to federal land in
the area of timbering, mining and tourism, and does not include
Mount Rushmore.
   Stevens argues the Sioux also should get up to $3.1 billion for
their loss of revenue since the land was taken.
   Bradley's bill, introduced two years ago and still not out of
committee, is opposed by South Dakota's congressional delegation.
   Many backers of Bradley's bill say Stevens' plan to seek
additional money would wreck the bill's chances in Congress.

   Your article on the Sioux Indian South Dakota land claim (page one, Dec. 24) missed the mark. 
The simple fact of history is that the Sioux Indians are a Minnesota tribe. 
It was only shortly before the white settlement of the Dakotas that the Sioux Indians moved here from Minnesota. 
If a truthful account of history means anything, the Sioux have a better claim to the Minnesota Twins' Metrodome than to the Black Hills. 

   Sen. Bradley mistakenly perpetuates the myth of the Black Hills as a Sioux holy land. 
All this does a disservice to the people who live, work and protect the beauty of the Black Hills. 
The shame of all this is the fear and anxiety it causes for landowners in South Dakota. 
Serious attention to this ridiculous land-grab raises questions about land titles.

   At night, in a one-room cabin here on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Charlotte Black Elk would lie in bed in the dark, listening to stories the Sioux elders told about the old days. 

   There were epic tales of "Sun Dances" and "Vision Quests," of battles and heroes and ceremonies rooted in tribal tradition. 
"We would imagine what we were hearing," recalls Ms. Black Elk, now 36 and an expert in Sioux lore. 
And always, she says, the Black Hills "were the place of our origin and the place we went back to." 

   Today, Ms. Black Elk and her husband, Gerald Clifford, are directing the Sioux's battle to reclaim the Black Hills, a 100-mile range of stubby mountains and pine-filled canyons that rise above the western plains of South Dakota. 
The two head the Black Hills Steering Committee, a coalition of eight Sioux tribes whose fight for federal holdings in the area has already taken on epic proportions of its own. 

   But their effort goes beyond the confines of just a bitter legal wrangle. 
In a broad sense, the Sioux's claim underscores the deep cultural and economic gap that still separates many Indians and whites in the rural West. 
Few whites comprehend the Indians' intense religious tradition -- a mystical relationship to ancestors and nature in which the Black Hills are "the heart of everything that is." 
And few Indians, in turn, have any stake in the Black Hills' white-oriented tourist economy of $600 million a year. 

   The Sioux have argued their claim through one or another federal arena for 64 years. 
In 1980, after the longest federal court battle in history, the U.S. Supreme Court condemned Congress's decision to take the Black Hills 110 years ago. 
The court called it a "ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealing" that was done to make room for hordes of gold-hungry prospectors. 

   Yet when the court awarded the Sioux $105 million in reparations -- but no land -- the Indians angrily spurned the government's money and took their fight back to their original nemesis: Congress. 
To further their cause, they have enlisted an unlikely champion. 
Sen. Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, has sponsored a bill to turn 1.3 million acres of federal land in the Black Hills into a Sioux-owned and operated national park. 
Only Mount Rushmore, deep in the Black Hills, would remain in federal hands. 

   So far, the bill has been bottled up by fierce opposition from South Dakota's congressional delegation, but the Sioux make it clear that they are in the battle for the long haul. 
The intensity of their commitment was evident in a recent skirmish with giant Honeywell Inc. 

   Earlier this year, Honeywell stumbled into the controversy by announcing plans to put an artillery range on 6,200 acres of remote Black Hills canyon land the company owned. 
The Sioux said the land was sacred and set up a prayer camp at the site. 
Honeywell executives wound up negotiating for their project in a tepee and finally scrapped the whole idea in October. 
"We kind of stepped into something more than we were ready for," a Honeywell spokeswoman says. 

   Black Hills residents, nearly all of them white, profess similar confusion. 
"We don't understand them, and they don't understand us," says Anelia Wright, the mayor of Custer, a Black Hills tourist town. 
White South Dakotans such as Mayor Wright fear that the Sioux claim, if successful, would dent the Black Hills tourist trade, the state's second-largest industry. 
More than three million tourists pour into the area each summer to visit a diverse collection of roadside attractions, from Reptile World to Mount Rushmore, the area's biggest tourist draw. 

   Sen. Bradley's bill would permit the Sioux to declare any land in the proposed park either sacred or in violation of the Sioux principle of "respect for the earth." 
The sites would be given the Sioux names "heart of the buffalo" and "sanctuary of everything that is" and would be closed to public access. 

   Critics are concerned that the bill offers no definition for either category. 
"This is very scary," says William Honerkamp, who heads the Black Hills Badlands and Lakes Association, a tourism trade group. 
Mr. Honerkamp fears that Sen. Bradley's bill "would make public lands, which are the backbone of our tourist industry, not-so-public lands." 

   Some angry Black Hills residents also insist that the Indians' claim is simply a land grab, no different from the one Congress exercised more than a century ago. 
Racial tensions run high. 
"The whites feel the Indians are trying to take our homes and our heritage," says William Sager, a third-generation businessman who runs a cafe in Custer. 
Adds Dean Murray, a druggist in nearby Hill City: "If this bill goes through, there's going to be trouble." 

   Tourism isn't a special concern on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 
Although Pine Ridge borders the southeastern corner of the Black Hills, few of its 18,000 Indian residents work there -- or work at all. 
Shannon County, which covers most of the reservation, has an unemployment rate approaching 85%. 
In the 1980 census, the government listed the county last in per-capita income in the U.S. 

   Sioux leaders say a more pressing concern than tourism is the Black Hills' religious significance. 
"Every peak has special meaning to our people," says Joseph American Horse, the chairman of the Oglala Sioux, whose tribal headquarters are on the reservation. 

   Mr. American Horse has made pilgrimages to Bear Butte, a stark volcanic outcrop near the Black Hills' northern perimeter where Indian worshipers have tied hundreds of brightly colored prayer cloths in the trees as tributes to ancestors. 
Ms. Black Elk says the Sioux believe that Harney Peak, a 7,242-foot mountain just three miles from Mount Rushmore, is the spiritual center of the universe. 
"All the Black Hills are sacred," she says, "every mountain, every cave opening, every valley." 

   Some historians, however, question the validity of this religious attachment. 
James A. Hanson, the head of the Nebraska Historical Society, says records kept by the Sioux tell of their discovery of the Hills around 1775, during a migration west from Minnesota. 
"Most of the Sioux's religious observances existed well before they ever saw the Hills," Mr. Hanson says. 

   Watson Parker, another Black Hills historian, says some of the Sioux's traditional stories were made up by local residents for tourist brochures, written to lure visitors during the 1920s and 1930s. 
"I wrote a few of them myself," says Mr. Parker. 

   The Sioux brush aside such objections. 
Timothy Giago, the publisher of the weekly Lakota Times, which is widely circulated on the Sioux reservations, says the tribes' oral history places them in the Black Hills well before 1775. 
Says Ms. Black Elk: "Scholars go to the written record and the written record is usually something the white man wrote." 

   Besides, Mr. Giago adds, the U.S. government signed a treaty giving the Sioux legal title to the Black Hills in 1868. 
"If you own a house," he says, "it doesn't matter who owned it first." 

   That 1868 treaty gave the Sioux "absolute and undisturbed use and occupation" of some 26 million acres spanning most of western South Dakota. 
The treaty lasted just eight years before Congress, under pressure from gold seekers, resketched its commitment. 

   Congress's revision took back more than seven million acres from the Sioux, including the Black Hills and the site of the Homestake Mine, the richest gold lode ever discovered in the U.S. and still an operating mine. 

   To make sure the Indians went along with the new treaty, Congress issued them a chilling ultimatum: Sign or starve. 
It threatened to cut off the supply of rations the government was providing the Indians, whose horses and weapons had been confiscated. 
Less than 10% of the male Sioux signed, but the government took the land anyway. 
When the details were ironed out, the Sioux ended up with almost nothing in compensation. 

   In its 1980 decision, the Supreme Court ruled narrowly that Congress acted illegally because it failed to give Indians just compensation for their land. 
But when the Sioux's lawyers brought back word of this victory, the Indians were enraged that it didn't include any land. 
They punctured the tires on their lawyers' car and chased them off the reservation. 
The Sioux still won't touch the federal money awarded them. 
It sits, now nearly $180 million with interest, in a government escrow account. 

   "The Black Hills aren't for sale," declares Mario Gonzalez, an Oglala Sioux attorney based on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 

   However, Mr. Gonzalez and others involved in the Sioux case say the tribes may have had unreasonable expectations of the courts. 
"Congress legally took the land by eminent domain, the way the government can take your house for an airport," says Marvin J. Sonosky, who represented the Sioux for 24 years. 
Adds Mr. Gonzalez: "The courts aren't capable of addressing the issues we want addressed. 
The only place left for us is Congress." 

   Enter "Tall Elk." 
The Sioux bestowed the title on Sen. Bradley in 1975 when the former New York Knicks basketball star visited the Pine Ridge Reservation to take part in summer basketball camps for Indian youngsters. 
When the Sioux approached Sen. Bradley in 1985, he agreed to sponsor their plan for the Sioux park in the Black Hills. 
He argues that it is legitimate for Congress to deal with the Sioux's claim "since Congress was part of the taking." 
Settling the Indians' complex demands, he admits, "will require maximum good will and understanding." 

   So far, those qualities are in short supply around here. 
Prickly relations between Indians and whites go back at least to 1874, when Col. George Armstrong Custer, the flamboyant Indian fighter, infuriated the Sioux by parading a party of U.S. cavalry-complete with brass band -- on a gold hunt through the Black Hills. 
Two years later, the Sioux, still angry over the intrusion, massacred Col. Custer and 225 of his troopers at the famous battle of the Little Big Horn in neighboring Montana. 

   More recently, in 1972, several hundred supporters of the activist American Indian Movement, including a number of Sioux, stormed the town of Custer. 
The contingent, protesting treatment of Indians by police and courts in the area, set fire to the town's courthouse and several other buildings. 
In response, Custer's 1,900 residents mobilized, posting snipers on rooftops and threatening to shoot to kill if the Indians returned. 

   Mrs. Wright, Custer's 67-year-old mayor, says Sen. Bradley's efforts have rekindled bad memories of that 1972 clash. 
"The Indians aren't entitled to the Black Hills," says the mayor, dismissing discussion of Sen. Bradley's bill with a wave of her cigarette. 
"My mind is closed," she says. 

   Only about 10% of the state's 600,000 residents are Sioux, and South Dakota's political leaders are virtually unanimous in their opposition to the Sioux's demands. 
"I don't think the Indians are legally, morally or fairly entitled to any of that land," thunders Sen. Larry Pressler. 
The South Dakota Republican says that the Sioux's claim has created "intellectual fascination" among liberal Democrats in Washington but that it is "overwhelmingly" opposed by his constituents. 

   Mr. Clifford, one of the leaders of the Sioux fight, helped draft Sen. Bradley's bill. 
He says that South Dakotans' concerns are based on "fear of the unknown" and that the language of the bill could be clarified to ease those feelings. 
"We're aware of the fears people have," Mr. Clifford says. 

   But recent infighting within the Sioux tribes has only heightened outsiders' unease. 
The Indians have been squabbling over a proposal made last month by California multimillionaire Philip J. Stevens, who claims to be a great-grandson of the Sioux warrior Standing Bear. 
Mr. Stevens suggests that in addition to claiming the Black Hills, the Sioux bill the government $3.1 billion in rent and mineral royalties for the territory. 
The Oglala, the largest Sioux tribe, recently voted to back Mr. Stevens. 
But other Sioux leaders say his proposal merely complicates matters and undermines the Sioux's land claim. 

   The Sioux are still deciding whether all the tribes will support Mr. Stevens. 
Whatever the outcome, the Indians say they are willing to be patient in their struggle to regain the Black Hills. 
Ms. Black Elk, who also heads Shannon County's Republican Party, notes that the Sioux are South Dakota's fastest-growing political bloc. 

   "The day will come when our opponents won't be in office anymore," she predicts. 
"And when that happens, we'll still be here with our claim."

   Your Dec. 24 article ("On the Warpath," page one) on legislation to return 1.3 million acres of land in the Black Hills of South Dakota to the Sioux Indian Nation paints a very unbalanced picture of a complex historical and legal matter. 

   In the late 1970s, I assisted the Sioux tribes on legislation to waive the legal doctrine of res judicata, thus allowing them to have their case heard by the Supreme Court. 
In fact, my speech in support of this legislation was quoted in the Supreme Court decision, U.S. v. 
Sioux Nation of Indians (1980). 
The Sioux prevailed in this case, and the court ruled that they were entitled to monetary reimbursement. 
My position is that the Supreme Court decision should be the final disposition of this matter, and many Indians in South Dakota agree.

   A widespread power outage struck parts of the West late
Wednesday afternoon, leaving cities in Wyoming and South Dakota
without electricity, authorities said.
   ``From what I've been told, it's a system-wide failure,'' said
Lt. Glen Talley of the Custer, S.D., sheriff's department. ``I've
talked to people at Black Hills Power and Light and they don't know
what the problem is.
   ``It looks like most of the Black Hills is without
electricity,'' he said.
   Cities known to have lost their power shortly after 4 p.m. MST
were Gillette, Wyo., and the South Dakota communities of Rapid
City, Spearfish, Belle Fourche, and Custer.
   In Gillette, police department Lt. Laurie Kadrich said police
were advising consumers to expect to be without power for at least
one hour, and possibly as long as three.
   ``The only thing we know right now is we're part of an area-wide
power outage,'' said Kadrich. ``We have strange power outages. Part
of the county is out, and part is in.''
   Utility officials could not immediately explain the outage,
which occurred in systems operated by the Black Hills Power and
Light Co., based in Rapid City, S.D., and the Portland, Ore.-based
Pacific Power and Light Co., which serves Utah, Idaho and Wyoming.

<TEXT>     What with one thing or another, a formal dedication of the Mount Rushmore
Memorial has been on hold ever since. But at long last, on this Fourth of July
in its golden anniversary year, the Mount Rushmore Memorial will be officially
ushered into our national park system.;    It's being billed as "a media
event," and I suppose I'll go even though I once had trouble with the idea of
sacrificing a perfectly good mountain to commemorate four politicians. But
I've mellowed a lot. For one thing, as politicians go, there couldn't have
been better choices. For another, the project seemed a good idea at the time
and we should try to judge events in the context of their times.;    And
there's no denying that Borglum did a whale of a job. His clay models at the
Sculptor's Studio near the visitors' center may seem crude, but the main work
is highly refined. If the thing had to be done, it couldn't have been done
better -- although it's difficult to understand how the money to build it
could be found during the Great Depression, while the money to repair cracks
in the carving is so hard to find today.;    Mount Rushmore is the great
public magnet of the Black Hills. No doubt about it. Millions of visitors go
into the heart of the Black Hills just to see those four faces, but then,
after a sandwich and a trip to the restroom, they're back on the interstate.
Too bad, for Mount Rushmore is just an added attraction; the main show is the
Black Hills region itself, an area that was beautifully photographed in the
Oscar-nominated epic, "Dances With Wolves.";    Nowhere else did so many parts
of the legendary West actually exist: forested mountains and deep canyons,
treeless plains, desert, cowboys, Indians, gold, prospectors, Custer's
cavalry, hell-roaring mining towns, buffalo herds. If there's anything on the
sundown side of the 100th meridian that qualifies as classic West, this is
it.;    I was an expert in such stuff by my 14th summer, thanks to Zane Grey
and the lurid yarns in Street &amp; Smith's Western Magazine. That was the year I
saw the Black Hills for the first time, and I wasn't disappointed. It was my
first look at real buffalo, real mountains and Sioux Indians. The only letdown
was in Deadwood when I stood at the graves of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill
Hickok and thought of having been born 80 years too late and missing all the
real fun.;    Then I turned and saw a character right out of Western fiction:
the last of the old Black Hills prospectors, Potato Creek Johnny in the flesh
-- a gnarled, bearded, ragged gnome of a man, no taller than I was, complete
with burro and gold pans and happy to tell a 14-year-old kid about the
half-pound nugget he found back in the glory days.;    Potato Creek Johnny
joined Wild Bill and Calamity years ago in the Mount Moriah Cemetery. They
have passed on with Custer and Crazy Horse, but the setting they all knew is
still there, as good as ever, a rich and genuine enclave of the Real West.;   
Maybe Deadwood isn't the hell-roaring gold camp it was when Wild Bill came to
town, but he could still find a little action. There's open gambling with
slots, blackjack and poker -- and there are signs on the doors of many Rapid
City businesses advising that knives and pistols aren't welcome on the
premises.;    South Dakota really consists of two parts: "East River" and
"West River." It's a valid distinction, for the West really begins at the
Missouri River. As you come out of the east on Interstate 90 and cross the Big
Muddy, you'll be near the south edge of the Fort Pierre National Grassland, a
vast reach of grass and sky of the kind pictured in "Dances With Wolves." This
place -- where you can still see the wind dancing, if not the wolves -- is
worth a short side trip. A hundred miles farther west you'll be skirting the
north walls of Badlands National Park -- a moonscape still being carved from
the volcanic ashes and clays of the Oligocene Epoch. Badger Clark, poet
laureate of South Dakota, called it a place where "millenniums winked like
campfire sparks/Down the winds of unguessed time.";    At the Badlands I
usually put on a certain hat. It was once South Dakota Wildlife Department
issue, a dressy Stetson now stained with sweat and bacon grease. My good-time
hat is generally reserved for special occasions and such good-time places as
the Badlands and Black Hills. Just a little farther down the road, on a clear
day, I know I'll see what looks like a distant storm front. A long low cloud
along the western skyline that is dark even in summer sunshine -- the Black
Hills of South Dakota. Those hills, like the old hat, mean adventure past,
adventure at hand and adventure yet to come.;    The Black Hills are "hills"
in name only. They easily qualify as mountains. Harney Peak is an impressive
7,242 feet high -- the tallest point east of the Rockies and the highest part
of what's known to geologists as "the Black Hills Dome.";    Back in the days
of two-lane main highways and 20-cent gasoline, the Black Hills were as far as
many of us could afford to go, or needed to. The region had about everything a
camper, fisherman, hiker or sightseer could want, and it was loaded with fine
tourist traps -- and still is.;    I have a feeling, though, that the Black
Hills have fallen a bit out of fashion as a prime destination, and I can't
understand why. It's said that only about 40 percent of the traffic into the
hills is "destination traffic.";    There are three basic components in a
successful vacation: enough time, enough money and something for everyone to
enjoy. The Black Hills rate high on all counts. Coming from the East, you'll
never get into the West any faster or with less gasoline. Coming from the
West, the Black Hills region and the West River grasslands are a grand
conclusion to eastward travel.;    In either case, there's a special added
attraction just before you get to the hills. A few miles to the east is
Badlands National Park; over on the west side, in Wyoming, is Devil's Tower
National Monument. If you come in from the south, there are Wind Cave National
Park and Jewel Cave National Monument.;    In the hills themselves, one of my
favorite places is Custer State Park -- a fine 73,000-acre mix of prairie and
ponderosa pine forest, with free-ranging buffalo, elk, coyotes, prairie dogs,
mule deer, antelope, prairie falcons, golden eagles, wild turkeys and even
bighorn sheep and Rocky Mountain goats in the rough breaks of French Creek.;  
 In the rugged heart of the Black Hills, igneous intrusions pierce the vast
dome of sedimentary rocks to form the spires of the Needles and the massifs of
Harney Peak and Mount Rushmore. That molten rock brought gold -- and the gold
would bring miners, cavalry and an Indian war.;    The Black Hills had been
made a permanent Indian reservation by the 1867 Laramie Treaty, but when the
Custer Expedition of 1874 'found gold among the roots of grass," a stampede of
fortune-hunters began flooding into the hills and trespassing on some of the
Indians' most sacred lands.;    I've been told by the Sioux that "when the
white man found gold in the Black Hills it was like striking oil under the
floor of the Vatican." This was a prime reason for the Indian wars of the
northern plains. And although the Indians would triumph briefly at the battles
of the Rosebud and Little Bighorn, the Black Hills would never again be
theirs.;    Gold is still big business in the hills. The Homestake Mine at
Lead is the largest underground gold mine in the world. In operation since
1876, it is also the oldest continuous producer. In August 1990, its total
production passed 36 million ounces. The diggings are now down to 8,000 feet,
with indications of ore reserves nearly half a mile deeper than that. There
are public tours of the upper workings and refinery, but none underground, and
this may be a chance to see some 24-carat ingots. Sorry, no free samples.;   
I've never done the Homestake tour, seen the shows at the Reptile Gardens or
Bear Country or visited the Green Door Brothel -- Deadwood's historic, but
inactive, sportin' house (no free samples there, either). I keep meaning to
see such places, but always seem to get hung up somewhere in the Badlands or
the breaks of French Creek, or in the 1.2 million acres of the Black Hills
National Forest. I keep going back to the Needles area and the trails on and
around Harney Peak and Sylvan Lake, where hot sun on ponderosa pine needles
smells just the same as it did in my 14th summer.;    The things that draw me
to the Black Hills and stay in my mind have little to do with Mount Rushmore
and the main tourist centers.;    I remember a day on the flanks of Harney
Peak when I climbed up into a jumble of immense granite outcrops and found a
grassy bowl only a few yards across. I could see by hoof prints that it had
been used by Rocky Mountain goats as a nursery. That was good enough for me. I
borrowed it from the goats for an afternoon siesta high above the main trail
and its hikers, staying until early evening when the smell of the open-pit
barbecue brought me down.;    Or the time when two of us rode our horses
through a herd of buffalo, and the tawny calves stopped frolicking to stare at
us, and my partner said: "I wonder what kind of buffalo they think we are.";

<LEADPARA>  'DANCES With Wolves" (nominated for 12 Academy Awards, including best picture

Costner's character makes friends with the Indians, whom he joins in a buffalo
hunt, which was filmed north of Fort Pierre on the 55,000-acre Triple U
Standing Butte Ranch. Owner Roy Houck stocks the ranch with as many as 3,000
buffalo.;    The movie's final scenes of a Sioux winter camp are in Spearfish
Canyon in the northern edge of the Black Hills.;    Painstaking research
produced a screenplay, costumes, sets and roles that seem true. The movie's
raunchy mule skinner, however, really lives in New York and bathes regularly.
The Hollywood wolf has never seen a buffalo, and painted Indians in real life
shop in suburban malls. And no, there weren't any buffalo killed during that
hell-for-leather hunt; those were mechanical animals on rails, made to fall in
clouds of dust. So like most movies, "Dances With Wolves" is illusion.;    But
there was no make-believe in the setting. Those vistas of treeless land
rolling toward far and open horizons really exist; if you can't see them
firsthand, the wide screen is next best.;    The superb cinematography truly
caught the clear light of the high plains with their stormy skies and flaming
sunsets, and the newly minted gold of cottonwood leaves beside a prairie
river.;    The Academy Awards are on March 25.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Casino Opens in Tiny Reservation Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gamblers drawn by $1 million jackpots and
pickup trucks as prizes are trying their luck at South Dakota's
first Indian casino, the newest hope of prosperity for the
hard-pressed Santee Sioux tribe.
   The casino, in the style of Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J.,
opened Tuesday with slot machines, card games and bingo on a dusty
plot of reservation land surrounded by cornfields outside
Flandreau, population 2,200.
   The town is small but the stakes are high for gamblers as well
as the Sioux, who stand to earn $750,000 to $1 million in the
casino's first year.
   Some of the slot machines offer a jackpot of $1 million. Others
offer new Ford pickups as top prizes.
   The tribe is the first of nine in South Dakota to receive state
permission to open a casino under the National Indian Gaming Act of
1988, based on a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that once a state
allows any form of gambling, Indian tribes can offer the same
games, without government restriction.
   ``It's cheaper than flying to Las Vegas and paying for plane
fare and hotels,'' said Sondra Feldman, who played the slots with
her husband, Norm.
   ``I think it'll go over good,'' said Mrs. Feldman, who lives in
nearby Sioux Falls.
   Jim Lewis, who developed the casino for the tribe, said he'll
make slightly less than the amount he estimates will go to the
Santee Sioux each year. He also wants to develop a supper club and
two hotels across from the casino.
   The casino's bingo section is hooked to the Megabingo network
that links bingo operations of other tribes. The network offers a
prize of $500,000 every night and $1 million on Saturdays.
   Thirty-five people were in line when the doors opened at 9 a.m.
By noon, Lewis estimated 300 people had gone through the casino.
Many in the crowd were retirees. Some people stopped by on their
lunch breaks. A check of license plates in the dirt parking lot
showed most were from South Dakota, with some from Minnesota.
   ``I think come this weekend, we should be seeing 3,000 people
through the doors,'' Lewis said.
   Flandreau is one of only two places where gambling is allowed in
South Dakota, which will soon join a regional lottery network with
neighboring states.
   Gambling began in 1989 in Deadwood, the Black Hills gold rush
town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876 while playing
poker. Since May, gambling has brought the town nearly 1,000 jobs
and strained streets, parking lots and water and sewer systems.
   The state Gaming Commission has approved gambling licenses for
at least 50 businesses in Deadwood.
   Casino supporters in Flandreau say it will bring much-needed
jobs and economic development.
   Indians are going through tough times in South Dakota. On nine
reservations, unemployment is about 80 percent and alcoholism,
drugs and poor health are severe. South Dakota has about 45,000
Indians, more than 6 percent of its population.
   Some of the gamblers pouring money into the casino's coffers
said they wouldn't want one in their hometown.
   ``It's not too good for the people,'' said Don Cover of Madison.
``It seems the people who can't afford to spend the most money. I
think they can come up with other ways to raise money.''

   Sam Eagle Staff still mourns the death
of the several hundred Sioux who fell in a cold, grassy valley when
U.S. cavalry troops opened fire on an Indian camp a century ago.
   ``We feel it was a murdering of our people without weapons,''
says Eagle Staff, whose uncle was one of the victims. ``What
happened there must have been a nightmare, something hard to live
with if you were there.''
   The Dec. 29, 1890, bloodshed at Wounded Knee was the last major
armed conflict between government troops and Indians. It also wiped
out the Sioux's last dream of ridding their lands of white
invaders.
   The Army called it a battle.
   The Sioux call it a massacre, a needless slaughter of mostly
unarmed Indian men, women and children by cavalry troops seeking
revenge for Lt. Col. George Custer's death at the Battle of the
Little Big Horn in Montana more than a decade earlier.
   Though they still feel hurt and sorrow, many Indians also see
the 100th anniversary as a chance to mend the Sioux Nation's sacred
hoop - their spiritual and cultural traditions.
   Riders on horseback are retracing the trail Chief Big Foot took
to Wounded Knee a century ago, and ceremonies will be held Saturday
in memory of those slain at the southwestern South Dakota site.
   The Lakota, which is what the Sioux call themselves, see new
hope for better race relations since South Dakota Gov. George
Mickelson proclaimed 1990 as the Year of Reconciliation between
Indians and whites.
   The anniversary offers the Sioux a chance to tell their side of
the story and to continue their effort to recover land,
particularly the nearby Black Hills, which they consider sacred.
   ``We want to send a note to everyone in the country and the
world that this type of thing will never happen again to any
Indians or any nationality,'' said Eagle Staff, a leader of a group
of descendants of Wounded Knee victims.
   The site lies in a valley flanked by pine-dotted ridges that
provide the name for the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the home of
the Oglala Sioux Tribe.
   In a tiny cemetery atop a small knoll, a chain-link fence
surrounds a mass grave where 146 Indians were buried in a long
trench. A tattered white flag flies over the site, and pieces of
cloth and bird feathers hang from the fence and flutter in the
wind.
   A stone monument for Big Foot and the people who died with him
stands to the side of the burial trench. Part of the message carved
in the stone says: ``Many innocent women and children who knew no
wrong died here.''
   What happened still is debated. Accounts from Indians and the
cavalry differed greatly.
   Government records show about 150 Indians were killed and 44
were wounded, while 30 or more soldiers died. The Sioux argue that
at least 300 Indians and perhaps more than 400 were slain at
Wounded Knee.
   The Sioux had been the dominant tribe in the northern Plains for
about a century after getting horses from other tribes and guns
from French traders. The Sioux warrior society peaked in 1876, when
they defeated Custer.
   Their fortunes rapidly went downhill after that, however, when
treaties stripped them of land and forced them onto reservations in
South Dakota.
   By 1890, the Ghost Dance religion had arisen with a promise that
the land and the decimated buffalo herds would be restored to the
Sioux and the white man would be swept away.
   After Sioux leader Sitting Bull was killed, Miniconjou Chief Big
Foot led a band of about 400 Sioux from central South Dakota to
seek refuge at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern
South Dakota.
   Cavalry troops found Big Foot's band, and by Dec. 29, the
rebuilt 7th Cavalry that Custer had commanded at the Little Big
Horn joined the other soldiers. Big Foot's camp was flying a white
flag.
   Accounts differ as to who fired first, but the shooting began
when the troops were collecting the Indians' guns. According to the
most common story, two soldiers wrestled with an Indian holding a
gun and the weapon fired.
   Army officers said a warrior took a rifle hidden under a blanket
and shot. When they heard that, the soldiers opened fire. The Ghost
Dance shirts worn by some of the Indians did not protect them.
   William Horn Cloud, 84, of Pine Ridge, heard the story of
Wounded Knee from his father, who was 14 when he survived the
fight. He and other descendants say soldiers drank heavily the
night before and wanted to settle an old score.
   ``They wanted revenge for Custer,'' says Horn Cloud. ``They were
there for one reason, and I guess they had a barrel of whiskey with
them.''
   Since they were in a circle, soldiers who died at Wounded Knee
probably were killed by their own gunfire, Horn Cloud says - the
same fusillade that cut down women and children as they tried to
escape to a nearby ravine.
   ``Those soldiers were shooting those screaming kids down,'' he
said.
   Each December for the past four years, Alex White Plume and
others have mounted horses and followed the trail that led Big
Foot's band to their death. They rode, he said, because they wanted
to change the future of the Sioux.
   This year's trail ride is the last one.
   White Plume, whose great-grandfather died at Wounded Knee, said
Sioux holy man Black Elk described how the sacred hoop of the Sioux
nation was shattered at Wounded Knee. Seven generations later, the
Sioux must mend the sacred hoop and rebuild themselves, he said.
   White Plume is not the only Sioux who is intent on looking
forward. The tribe lauds the governor's reconciliation effort.
   ``There is prejudice here in South Dakota. We hope to eliminate
this some day,'' said Eagle Staff. ``It can be done, but it's going
to take a long, long time. This is just the beginning.''
   The Wounded Knee Survivors Association asked Congress to issue
an apology, pay compensation to descendants and create a national
monument at Wounded Knee. In October, Congress passed a resolution
expressing ``deep regret'' for Wounded Knee. Many Sioux said it
wasn't much of an apology.
   But Eagle Staff said members of the survivors' group decided to
accept the congressional resolution as an apology, based on a
pledge that more attention would be paid to the national monument
and the compensation issue.
   Still, there is a lingering distrust. Some want the government
to revoke the congressional Medals of Honor given to soldiers who
were at Wounded Knee.
   Horn Cloud describes his idea for a monument: Some cannons on a
hill, with a statue of a soldier firing into a huddled group of
Indian children.
   ``His chest would be all filled up with medals for bravery,''
Horn Cloud said.

   Firefighters battling a 5-day-old,
16,500-acre blaze near Mount Rushmore National Memorial finally had
the weather on their side Friday as they worked to reinforce
existing fire lines before digging new ones.
   Brief late-afternoon thundershowers pelted parts of the fire in
the Black Hills National Forest, including the southwestern side
considered the most serious problem area.
   ``This southern portion of the fire got dumped on pretty good,''
said fire information officer Jerry Hagen. ``We don't think the
whole fire got rained on.''
   Rainfall amounts were not known, but firefighters getting ready
to go on the night shift were smiling during a 30-minute
thundershower and hail storm.
   Earlier, Dennis Neill of the U.S. Forest Service said the
showers helped lower the temperature and raise the humidity, but
also could bring stronger winds and the possibility of lightning.
   Lightning is believed to have started the fire Monday night in
Custer State Park. It spread Wednesday into the Black Hills
National Forest, site of the memorial to four presidents. Friday
afternoon, flames jumped a highway and 30 families were ordered to
evacuate.
   The blaze could be contained by Sunday night if the weather
holds, said Richard Homann, a spokesman for the state Division of
Forestry.
   In Alaska, meanwhile, 32 fires burned, four of which had
consumed more than 290,000 acres. Fires also burned on in
drought-parched timber and grassland in Wyoming, Utah and South
Carolina.
   The South Dakota fire threatened Mount Rushmore National
Memorial and the town of Keystone on Wednesday night, but it
stopped short of the tourist stops, both of which had been
evacuated. Mount Rushmore and Keystone were reopened Thursday, but
Custer State Park remained off-limits.
   The fire had burned an estimated 16,500 acres by late Friday.
Seventeen miles of fire line had been built and 64 percent of the
perimeter had been contained, Hagen said.
   The cost to fight the fire so far is $361,000, and it could cost
$1 million when all the expenses are tallied, Homann said.
   In Alaska, a blaze that had come within 10 miles of the Alaska
Pipeline was held in check for a second day. Northern Alaska's
major fires are a 126,000-acre blaze 15 miles north of Livengood; a
40,000-acre fire near Ambler; a 53,000-acre fire northeast of Fort
Yukon; and a 51,000-acre fire north of Central.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Wyoming, three fires in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
totaling nearly 1,500 acres were spreading firefighters thin in the
rough terrain. Although one of the fires was only three acres,
officials warned that it had to potential to rapidly become a major
blaze. The fire near Pinedale, at 1,300 acres by far the largest of
the three, was declared controlled Friday morning.
   Firefighters working on a 1,650-acre fire in Wyoming's Shoshone
National Forest continued mop-up work, and state Forestry Division
crews contained fires covering almost 2,000 acres in Converse,
Sheridan and Weston counties.
   _A wind-whipped fire in Echo Canyon in northern Utah doubled in
size overnight to about 650 acres, but fire bosses were optimistic
it would be contained late Friday, said Interagency Fire Center
spokesman Pete Hansen. Firefighters controlled both the 900-acre
blaze in Zion National Park and a 3,500-acre fire near the Nevada
border.
   _A 1,000-acre timberland fire near Nixonville, S.C., that jumped
plowed fire lines in five places Thursday was declared contained
Friday. Two water bucket-equipped helicopters helped contain the
blaze, which began Wednesday on land owned by International Paper
Co.

<HEAD>Gambling May Return To Town Where Wild Bill Hickok Played Fatal
Poker Game</HEAD>

   Gambling helped build the reputation of
this Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down during
a poker game 112 years ago. Now city officials hope a return to
gambling will help preserve it.
   Voters statewide will be asked Nov. 8 to approve a
constitutional amendment allowing the Legislature to permit limited
gambling in Deadwood with the proceeds dedicated to preservation of
historic buildings. Deadwood voters also would have to approve the
final plan by 60 percent.
   ``We've always said Deadwood has the potential to be the Aspen
of the Midwest,'' said Bill Walsh, an owner of the Franklin Hotel,
at one end of the colorful Main Street. He said he wants to see
gambling limited to a few card tables and slot machines in existing
establishments.
   Walsh said gambling will draw more visitors year-around,
creating more jobs in service industries and pumping dollars into
the economy of the entire Black Hills.
   But others oppose gambling on moral grounds and say the
Constitution shouldn't be changed for the sake of one town.
   ``I'm opposed to any kind of gambling,'' said the Rev. Dick
Ward, a United Methodist minister in Rapid City who is mobilizing
opposition statewide. ``It preys on people that are weak. It gives
them the idea that they are going to get rich quick.''
   South Dakota's 99-year-old Constitution forbids games of chance,
but allows the Legislature to approve gambling for charitable,
religious, educational or public spirited purposes. In 1986, voters
amended the document to allow a state-run lottery, which began last
year.
   Other attempts to approve gambling have failed, including one
that would have allowed all communities to make local decisions on
games of chance.
   But city officials claim widespread support for gambling. They
say people are committed to historic preservation, and the money
has to come from somewhere.
   Mayor Tom Blair said it will take about $20 million to save more
than 100 buildings. He said his town of 1,800 people is overwhelmed
by the task of restoring and preserving the buildings Deadwood
built a century ago when 10,000 people lived in this boisterous
mining community.
   ``We have had a real unique stewardship handed to us by the
National Park Service,'' Blair said, adding that Deadwood is the
only entire city in South Dakota to be registered as a National
Landmark.
   Age, neglect and fire threaten to destroy that legacy unless
expensive restoration begins right away, the mayor said.
   The city got a painful reminder of that last December when fire
destroyed two historic buildings in the heart of the commercial
district, stopping at the wall of Saloon No. 10 where Hickok, the
frontier marshal, was shot to death Aug. 2, 1876, while playing
poker.
   ``I think it's true that a lot of people had their eyes opened
up on this after this fire,'' said Herb Haist, city planner.
   Most of the city's buildings were erected in the 20 years
between 1880 and 1900, Blair said. Earlier buildings were lost in
previous fires.
   Stately brick buildings, now turned into tourist shops, line
both sides of historic Main Street. Grand houses perch recklessly
on the steep sides of Deadwood Gulch, forming a city seven blocks
wide and three miles long.
   People across South Dakota should vote for the amendment the
future in mind, Walsh said. ``So South Dakotans can say, `Hey, we
saved Deadwood. We saved a part of our past.'''

<DESCRIPT>  AMERICAN-INDIAN; OPINION; US; HISTORY; MOVIE; IMAGE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AFTER MONTHS of acclaim, Kevin Costner's film "Dances with Wolves" has become
an important psychological purgative for white America.;    We have finally
expelled from our imagery the traditional Hollywood Indian -- the shiftless
savage who can't hold his liquor -- and replaced him with the more complex and
authentic characters of Costner's story.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DANCING WITH MYTHS
HOLLYWOOD, COSTNER IGNORE HISTORICAL FACTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Paul W. Valentine is a Washington Post reporter.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Yet in our guilt-laden rush to embrace the new images, we risk creating a
new stereotype prompted at least in part by the Costner film, a sort of
romanticized flip-side caricature of the native American as all nobility,
wisdom and oneness with the earth.;    History suggests that that vision, like
all stereotypes, is oversimplified. It lumps all Native Americans into a
monolithic whole, rather than distinguishing among their rich, varied and
sometimes not so pretty parts.;    The temptation to exalt the Indian
nevertheless is great, given the Euro-American depredations against him over
the last 500 years and the instinct to compensate for our sins. Indeed, for
the last several years (and well before Costner's film was conceived), Indians
have enjoyed a resurgence in cultural pride and received support from a wide
range of white activists, authors, politicians and back-to-nature advocates.; 
  To varying degrees, these advocates have made three assertions about the
American Indian: that he is endowed with a unique reverence for the earth;
that his social conduct, buttressed by an ancient wisdom, is universally
guided by humane and egalitarian instincts; and that he has an immutable
ancestral claim to every acre of America.;    But history tells us that
Indians, like all other groups on the face of the earth, are a mixed lot with
an enormous and varied capacity for both good and evil.;    Death traps;  It
is well documented, for example, that while many tribes prior to the
Europeans' arrival carefully husbanded the land and hunted animals
selectively, others, such as the Arapaho of eastern Colorado, stampeded herds
of bison into death traps by igniting uncontrolled grass fires on the
prairies. Only the best animals were butchered. The rest were left for the
vultures or tribal competitors.;    "For many years afterward, animals could
not find food in such burned-over areas, and starvation would finish the
destruction," wrote historian Elizabeth Beaty in "Americans Before Columbus.";
   (When Europeans introduced the horse to the New World in the 16th century,
plains Indians began hunting more selectively, using swift riders to cull only
the best bison for meat and hides, while letting the rest go. The white man
continued to slaughter, often shooting the animals only for hides and assorted
trophies.);    Agricultural Indians in New England cleared land by
slash-and-burn technique, while more nomadic hunters and gatherers moved from
spot to spot seeking food, and strewing refuse in their wake. While such
despoliation was modest compared to the industrial pollution of late 20th
century America, in the scale of the times, it was considerable.;    The
second assertion -- that the Indian enshrined the virtues of brotherhood and
egalitarianism -- also finds spotty support in history.;    While there were
tribes that were free, peaceful and humane, others were totalitarian, warlike
and extremely brutal. Some practiced slavery, torture, human sacrifice and
cannibalism and imposed rigid social dictatorships.;    The Tahltans of
Canada, who fought constantly with their neighbors, killed male prisoners and
enslaved the women. Many Choctaws and Cherokees in the southeastern United
States in the 19th century owned African slaves, just like their white
neighbors.;    Iroquois brutality;    Among some tribes of the famed Iroquois
Confederacy, the punishment for murder was death to the perpetrator or, if he
fled, to a male member of his family. Adultery was also sometimes punishable
by death, but more frequently the offender had his ears or lips cropped or the
end of his nose cut off.;    While tribes as diverse as the Hopis of the
Southwest and the Slaves of subarctic Canada were known for their gentle ways
and humane treatment of the old and infirm, other groups were brutal in the
extreme. The Crees and Chipewyans of central Canada killed or abandoned their
old people who could not keep up with migrations.;    There's the third and
greatest assertion: that the American Indian has clear and unsullied title
from time immemorial to the land now occupied by whites.;    Let there be no
doubt: Invading Europeans since the 16th century literally took America, much
of it by force or subterfuge. But in the millenia before the white arrival,
the Indians were doing precisely the same thing to each other.;    The history
of Indian migrations into the New World from Asia is the history of group
after group displacing one another, fighting over land, water and hunting
grounds, redrawing the lines, making temporary alliances and often remaining
in one spot only briefly before moving on.;    Large inhospitable chunks of
North America were never settled at all or only so sparsely and erratically
that human occupation was in name only. Some tribes like the Hopis, Slaves and
Hares were peaceful, but many others were not only warlike but actively
imperialist.;    The entry of Europeans onto this scene 500 years ago was, in
an historic sense, simply an elaboration, an extension, of what had been
occurring during the millenia before their arrival-expropriation, war,
imperialism. But the new imperialists had the horse, the wheel and the gun.
Their influence, thus, was more pervasive and more lasting.;    The best
example of contemporary Indian claims to ancestral lands is the claim by
segments of the Sioux Indian nation to the Black Hills area of South Dakota
and Wyoming.;    In a narrow legalistic sense, the Sioux's claim is correct.
The whites took the land illegally, by force, and the U.S. Supreme Court has
so ruled. But in a broader, moral sense, the Sioux are on less firm ground.
The truth is that they came into possession of the Black Hills in the same way
-- by main force -- as the white man, and their claim is just as tenuous.;   
Relative newcomers;  The Sioux in fact are relative newcomers to the Black
Hills, arriving only in the mid-17th century, and then driving out the Kiowa
and Cheyenne tribes. The Sioux, in turn, had been forced from Minnesota and
southern Ontario by the hostile Ojibways. That is documented history.;    Less
reliable oral history and archeological evidence indicate that the Crows
occupied the Black Hills prior to the Kiowas and Cheyennes, and before them,
nearly 1,000 years ago, the Arapaho were there. One thing is certain: No
single group lived in the Black Hills permanently from the mists of time.
Rather, tribe after tribe, all culturally disparate, speaking different
languages, praying to different gods, squabbled over the land.;    The only
difference is that some of the later tribesmen had white faces. (box)  </TEXT>

   When Claire Scholz started making children's
bathtub puppets 10 years ago, she thought in terms of thousands.
Before long, she may be talking millions.
   Although her company remains tiny _ consisting of Ms. Scholz and
two other staffers _ her trademark Tub Buddies are getting
nationwide exposure in newspaper promotions. And her success is
providing production work for two factories in rural South Dakota
and valuable employment opportunities for handicapped workers in
the state.
   ``One nice thing about our stuff is that it can go into rural
areas where unemployment is bad,'' said the puppet maker.
   Ms. Scholz aleady has received the 1988 Governor's Cup for her
contributions to special education in South Dakota.
   ``They can do a lot more things than we allow them to do,'' Ms.
Scholz said of handicapped workers. ``There's a lot they can do
better than people off the street.''
   She stumbled into the business through contacts she made at a
New York product show. ``It is very much an industry of who you
know,'' she said.
   Her Drizzle the Dragon, for instance, is offered as a premium
for buying a brand of toilet bowl cleaner. Consumers who send in
proof-of-purchase seals from the product are eligible to buy
Drizzle at a reduced price.
   Ms. Scholz is also working on deals to feature puppets with
chewing gum, tea, life insurance and spark plugs.
   ``The danger of the premium industry is that it's a one-time
deal,'' she said.
   She said cartoonist Charles Schulz is working on a Snoopy design
to fulfill one company's request. Another firm wants Kermit the
Frog, one of the famous Muppet characters created by Jim Henson.
   On a recent trip to New York, Ms. Scholz toured Henson's
workshop. ``It was South Dakota girl goes to heaven,'' she said.
   Her puppets are good for product premiums because the price is
right, $3.99 to $5.99 retail, and the quality is high, she said.
   ``More and more the awareness is coming back to `Made in the
USA' products,'' she said.
   Ms. Scholz, 38, started manufacturing bathtub puppets in
Deadwood, S.D., in 1978 after spending several years traveling the
country doing street theater with a group called ``Dragons Are Too
Seldom Puppets,'' named after an Ogden Nash poem.
   In 1980, her company, now called ``Dragons Are Too Seldom
Inc.'', sold 20,000 puppets through individual gift and toy stores.
Two years later, she got into mass marketing, and by 1984, she was
selling 300,000 puppets a year, produced by 120 home seamstresses
in the northern Black Hills.
   Half a million Tub Buddies sold last year, and she hopes to
double that figure in 1988. In addition, she produces Rub-A-Dub
Glubs _ soft, fuzzy bath mitts shaped like a pirate ship or Noah's
Ark.
   Two new products, still being developed, are expected this
summer. ``We're kind of getting out of the bathtub,'' she hinted.
   As the company grows, pressures change for Ms. Scholz. When no
bank would lend her money to get started 10 years ago, she
persuaded private investors to take a chance. Later, she obtained a
Small Business Administration loan. Now she owns 93 percent of the
company.
   With success has come other problems. Ms. Scholz recently won a
copyright lawsuit in Boston against a company that made what she
calls ``bad copies'' of Tub Buddies.
   Gone are the home workers, replaced at first by a manufacturing
plant in Missouri, and later by the South Dakota factories
employing handicapped individuals.
   Prairie Trends, a for-profit factory, was set up by the Huron
Area Adjustment Training Center to produce about 200,000 puppets
this year. The 26 people producing the puppets include eight
handicapped workers who handle packaging and shipping.
   ``If we had more entrepreneurs like Claire we would have a lot
more work for our people,'' said Tom Meekins, executive director of
the training center, a private agency.
   In Sturgis, the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative has
been producing Ms. Scholz's creations for three years and will turn
out 450,000 pieces in 1988. The co-op is a public agency that
educates special students from 12 school districts. About 50
percent of the co-op factory's workers are handicapped.
   ``One more factory would be nice,'' Ms. Scholz said, if the
business continues to grow.

   Thousands _ maybe hundreds of thousands _
of motorcyclists are converging on this small, unassuming town from
all points of the compass. And they're finding the welcome mat out.
   Every year since 1940, the town of 7,000 on the edge of western
South Dakota's Black Hills has played host to motorcyclists out to
enjoy races, tours and general communal good times.
   The weeklong 50th Black Hills Motor Classic starting Monday is
expected to draw anywhere from 140,000 to 400,000 to a town that,
on a normal day, you can drive through in less than five minutes.
Most of the visitors own Harley-Davidsons.
   ``It's an extremely small-town-type atmosphere when the rally's
not here,'' said Marcy Myhre, executive director of the Black Hills
Motor Classic Board and nine-year Sturgis resident.
   ``This year it's going to be exceptionally big,'' said Randy
Billings of Phoenix, who is here with his wife, Karen. ``Every
Harley rider I know says he's coming up.''
   Last year's rally attracted only an estimated 60,000 people, at
least partly because of this year's anniversary, said Ron Paull of
Spokane, Wash. He and his wife, Jean, are running a T-shirt stand
for Spokane's Latus Motors Harley-Davidson for the fourth year.
   ``Everyone we talked to said, `Oh, my buddy didn't show up
because he's waiting for next year,''' Paull said.
   During the rally, Main Street and two other thoroughfares are
taken over by vendors like the Paulls selling every kind of biker
paraphernalia imaginable, from T-shirts to knife cases.
   By Wednesday, Main Street was a study in blue jeans, black
T-shirts and leather.
   While Hell's Angels from Ohio roared down Main Street, the
Paulls talked about how they first came to the rally as part of a
Christian bike group. They said that in the five years they've
attended, they've met people from France, Austria, Australia, South
Africa and West Germany, ``lots of West Germans.''
   The rally's reputation has hit the mainstream public
consciousness only recently.
   It was mentioned in an episode of the ABC series ``Roseanne''
last season. Roseanne Barr and her TV husband were visited by biker
friends, and one was asked if he would go to this year's rally.
   The response: ``Everybody and their dog are going to be there.''
   In 1986, a crew from the British Broadcasting Corp. filmed a
documentary on the rally. In 1988, actor Mickey Rourke rode his
Harley in from California.
   Last year, millionaire Harley lover Malcolm Forbes showed up
with his green and gold motorcycle, saying Sturgis is a ``mecca for
anyone who loves Harleys.'' Forbes died Feb. 25.
   Some rally-goers belong to established groups, such as Hell's
Angels, Banditos and Sons of Silence.
   A man was shot during one rally, but that's beyond the norm,
said Police Chief Jim Bush.
   ``It goes pretty well usually,'' said Bush, a 12-year veteran of
the 10-member force who's in his first year as chief. ``We've never
had a whole lot of great big problems.''
   However, with the predictions of huge crowds, a state task force
has been working with local officials since October to make sure
there's enough support for law enforcement, traffic control,
sanitation and firefighting.
   A few businesses have complained that not enough is done to
protect them during rally time.
   Despite that, ``I think overall, businesses feel good about the
rally,'' Myhre said.
   ``Most people, I think, accept it,'' Bush said. ``There's money
to be made, and they like the idea of the community being known
throughout the world.''

   Firefighters cut the final three miles of fire line through a
steep, rocky area on the southwest edge of a fire that stalled
Saturday after burning 16,500 acres in the Black Hills of South
Dakota.
   Meanwhile, a fire that scorched hundreds of acres in a Michigan
state forest forced the evacuation of about 200 people, Wisconsin
firefighters battled several fires in drought-parched areas of the
state, and Utah crews contained a stubborn blaze and hoped to have
it controlled by Sunday.
   Elsewhere:
   _ Firefighters brought the blaze in Wyoming's Shoshone National
Forest under control Saturday afternoon, helped in part by rainy
weather earlier in the week.
   _ Fires that have scorched more than 2,000 acres of Harriman
State Park in New York were contained, a park ranger said.
   _ A single-engine plane crash-landed on a highway in the
foothills behind Palo Alto, Calif., Saturday, triggering a small
brush fire and forcing closure of a five-mile stretch of the
roadway. Sheriff's Sgt. Gary Hoss said the pilot suffered minor
injuries in the incident just above Devil's Canyon.
   _ And firefighters contended with forest fires across eastern
Kentucky as temperatures soared into triple digits, and a Division
of Forestry spokesman called on the governor to consider declaring
a fire emergency in the state.
   In South Dakota, more problems arose when four new fires
started. Some of the 1,200 firefighters at the main fire scene were
pulled away to douse the latest blazes that apparently were started
by lightning Friday night, said Steve Libbey, fire information
officer.
   One of the new fires came within a half-mile of the Blacks Hills
Playhouse, a summer theater that was narrowly missed by the main
fire earlier in the week.
   Only one of the new fires, at Flint Hill west of Edgemont, had
been contained by Saturday afternoon, Libbey said.
   Roads skirting the northwest and northeast corners of
73,000-acre Custer State Park were reopened Saturday, but the park
itself remained closed to the public.
   Thirty families evacuated from an area just outside the western
park boundary were allowed to return home at their own risk, a fire
spokesman said. They had been ordered to leave Friday after flames
jumped Highway 87 on the southwest edge of the fire in the area
around Mount Coolidge.
   The main fire has been burning since Monday night. Fire
officials suspect lightning that ignited the extremely dry forest
in the north-central part of Custer State Park.
   The blaze, named the Galena Fire, is by far the largest fire
ever in the park, but not the biggest in the Black Hills, officials
said.
   In Michigan, residents who live near Clear Lake had to leave
their homes when a fire roared through Au Sable State Forest on
Saturday.
   The fire spread rapidly, burning at least 400 acres with 3{
hours, said John MacGregor of the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources.
   About 100 firefighters were battling the blaze, he said.
   ``We've got a good organization in place and a lot of good
equipment so we're in a good position to hold the fire,'' MacGregor
said.
   Authorities said the cause of the fire was still under
investigation.
   In Wisconsin, three fires near Portage burned a home, an acre of
grass and 26 acres of woods and grass. A sheriff's deputy suffered
minor burns and a firefighter suffered heat exhaustion fighting the
most extensive blaze, about five miles northeast of Portage.
   Portage Fire Chief Rick Trevaskis said the fire was started by a
farmer who was burning trash in violation of the statewide burning
ban.
   The lightning-caused Echo Canyon fire that charred 475 acres of
sagebrush and some aspen trees in Utah was contained Friday night,
said Interagency Fire Center dispatcher Lori Ensley.
   Containment of the Echo Canyon blaze followed recent battles
against a number of fires in Utah, including a 900-acre fire in
Zion National Park and a 3,500-acre fire near the Nevada border.

   PINE RIDGE, S.D. -- Out here where the winds are gritty
and vastness of the prairie makes cattle look like black dots
against the rolling landscape, the Lakota Sioux Indians once
lived free.
   The tribe has become known to millions through the film
"Dances With Wolves." The Kevin Costner movie depicts the
Sioux as a proud and hardy people who survived rugged prairie
life through a deep understanding of nature, strong sense of
community and rich spiritual life. "Dances With Wolves,"
based just after the Civil War, has won widespread praise for
its realistic portrayal of Native American Indians. It could
be a big winner at tonight's Academy Awards.

<TEXT>
   Little about this arid prairie land has changed in a
century. But for the descendants of the Lakota Sioux, life
today is a very different struggle for survival.
   Most Sioux Indians were run off their land more than 100
years ago into a reservation in the southwestern corner of
South Dakota, in Shannon County, far from the pristine
grasslands where much of "Dances With Wolves" was filmed. It
is one of the poorest counties in the nation. And nowhere are
conditions worse than on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,
home to 12,000 Sioux.
   The grim statistical litany of life on Pine Ridge tells
reams about what has happened to the Sioux in the 100 years
since the West was won. Sixty percent of youths drop out of
high school. Rapid City, the closest urban center, enjoys one
of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, but on the
reservation, 87% of adults don't have jobs.
   At Pine Ridge's only hospital, one in four babies is born
twitching and shaking with delirium tremens, the result of
their mothers' drinking during pregnancy; they will suffer
learning disabilities later in life. Pine Ridge's infant
mortality rate is 50% higher than that of Cuba, Costa Rica or
Bulgaria; fetal alcoholism syndrome and poor nutrition are
largely to blame. The incidence of diabetes is five times the
national average, the suicide rate double.
   Health care is limited. Last year, the hospital's 11
doctors handled an average of 9,636 outpatient visits each.
Right now, there's a hepatitis outbreak. "We're worse off
than Kuwait," says Alex White Plume, a member of the
executive committee that governs the reservation.
   Day after day, a steady stream of the needy visits his
cramped office in the Red Cloud Tribal Center. An elderly
woman with skin like tanned leather asks the tribe for an
emergency grant to help her pay the funeral expenses for her
young daughter who was killed, along with her unborn child,
in a car wreck on one of the reservation's unpaved roads. But
all Mr. White Plume can offer is some buffalo meat for the
traditional funeral dinner.
   He can't even help his own uncle, who is housing 23 people
in a two-bedroom home.
   Tribal leaders like Mr. White Plume say the Sioux's
current problems can't be separated from the past, and the
experience that robbed Indians of their ancestral lands,
their spiritual traditions and their dignity. Until 13 years
ago, federal law prohibited the Sioux from practicing many
spiritual rites on the reservation. Children caught speaking
the Lakota language at Catholic mission schools were
punished. "Over time, the Indian people internalized a sense
of hopelessness," says Rene Mills, a 44-year-old Sioux.
   The reservation land itself virtually assured that the
Sioux would languish. Their 1.7 million acres west of the
Missouri River are among the toughest in the state on which
to farm or ranch. A large chunk of Pine Ridge includes the
Badlands, a moon-like landscape where not even grass will
grow in the alkaline soil.
   A vast welfare system gives Pine Ridge's residents little
incentive to break the poverty cycle. "A person would have to
earn $7 an hour to do better than welfare pays them," says
Tom Cook, an Indian leader from nearby Chadron, Neb. Those
who take jobs must pay 30% of their housing costs, while
those who remain on public assistance live rent-free.
   The Sioux and their legendary chief, Sitting Bull, were
among the last holdouts against white settlers. Pine Ridge
includes Wounded Knee, where U.S. soldiers killed at least
200 Indians in a single day in 1890. Tensions have remained
high between the whites and Indians ever since.
   Border towns in Nebraska that got rich selling liquor to
reservation Indians used to attach signs to work sites that
said "No Dogs or Indians." Mr. Mills, who has a bachelor's
degree in sociology and a masters in education
administration, took $5-an-hour construction jobs to support
himself.
   The success of "Dances With Wolves" has stirred deep
feelings. Robert Grey Eagle, a Sioux lawyer, says the film is
helping teach whites that the Indians have much to offer in
their understanding of nature, concern for the environment
and deep inner life. "When I went into the movie theater, I
was just another insignificant Native American to most of the
other people there, one of those grim statistics hanging
around Rapid City," he says. "When I came out, I felt that
people were looking at me in a different light."
   Mr. Grey Eagle and his wife, Jeaneen, are part of a new
generation of Sioux leaders who believe the Sioux can break
out of the cycle of poverty that has enmeshed them since
1889, when their leaders, exhausted by battles with
land-hungry settlers and the U.S. military, agreed to move
the tribe onto reservations.
   Mr. Cook, for instance, with help from the non-profit
Christian Relief Services, is farming the reservation land
owned by his wife's family. He is using the Israeli drip
system of irrigation and Japanese style wind fences to deal
with the two biggest obstacles to farming in the region, lack
of water and high winds. Mr. Cook says one reservation farmer
earned $16,000 last year farming four acres of cucumbers,
cantaloupes and tomatoes. Mr. Cook is trying to get other
Indians interested in joining him in a farming cooperative.
   With a private grant and money she saved from working a
secretary's job, Mr. Cook's wife, Loretta, opened the first
Indian-owned business in Chadron, a shop that sells Sioux
jewelry and artifacts. Mrs. Cook's shop provides work for 107
Pine Ridge residents who hand-craft the items she sells.
   The reservation has its own radio station now, where most
of the programs are in the Lakota language. Tribal leaders
are trying to get approval for a television station to teach
Indian youths about their culture and spiritual traditions.
   And Mr. Grey Eagle is pushing tribal leaders to seek light
manufacturing for the reservation. He sees vast untapped
potential in the valuable mineral rights that sit beneath
reservation lands. There are natural gas deposits as well as
18 billion tons of zeolite, a natural substance used in cat
litter.
   But there are many obstacles. Few businesses have been
willing to venture onto the reservations. There are no banks.
In fact, there are only 14 private businesses on the
reservation: two gas stations, one hairdresser and 11 small
grocery stores. There are few paved roads.
   Just as difficult to overcome is the mistrust many tribal
leaders feel about doing business with non-Indians. They
offer many examples why: There's the meatpacking company that
received a federal grant to locate its plant on the
reservation and hire Indians, but did neither. And the
company that South Dakota Sen. Thomas A. Daschle says will
pay so little to dump waste on another reservation that he
derides the plan as "Dances With Garbage."
   The Sioux were even skeptical of Mr. Costner and his
production crew. The first week of location shooting, some of
the more elderly Indians complained that the $40 a day they
earned as extras wasn't enough, although co-producer Jim
Wilson said it was $5 more than extras normally receive on
non-union films. To keep up good relations, the producers
quickly agreed to increase the pay to $55.
   Tribal leaders have tried to regain 1.7 million acres in
the Black Hills, the mountains that ring much of the South
Dakota prairie, which they say the government took illegally.
The Supreme Court agreed with the Sioux and ordered the tribe
compensated, but didn't give back the land. The Indians have
refused to take their $300 million award, opting instead to
press their land claim in Congress.
   Now some Sioux see an opportunity in tourism. "Dances With
Wolves" has sparked interest in the Indian customs portrayed
in the movie, many of which are still practiced by the South
Dakota Sioux. Mr. Mills, who is the tribal tourism director,
is trying to identify all of the sites in the area with
special significance, such as Sitting Bull's grave, so he can
establish an Indian history trail ride.
   But the reservations are hardly ready to be showcased.
Most people live in old trailers or box-like prefabricated
government housing that has fallen into disrepair. There are
no hotels. Mounds of tires and piles of rusty car parts spot
the landscape. "How can you justify sending someone in a
$50,000 RV down an unpaved road to see the squalor that
exists on the reservation?" asks Deb Cottier, executive
director of the Chadron Chamber of Commerce.
   Instead, the chamber is considering attracting tourists by
building a re-creation of an Indian village.

   George Mickelson was 7 when he watched his
father, the governor, help sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski dynamite the
first rock from a rugged Black Hills mountain that the artist
wanted to shape into a likeness of Sioux Indian leader Crazy Horse.
   Mickelson, now governor himself, planned to help Ziolkowski's
widow set off another explosion today to mark the 40th anniversary
of the start of that project, which is still under way in western
South Dakota.
   Mickelson said his return to Crazy Horse Memorial, about 10
miles west of Mount Rushmore National Memorial, would follow the
Indian theme that life moves in circles.
   ``We've now come full circle,'' Mickelson said. ``It's something
I've kind of grown up with. It's special to me.''
   Ziolkowski died in 1982 at age 74. His wife, Ruth, and eight of
their 10 children have continued to blast and carve Thunderhead
Mountain.
   Mickelson said he remembers that at the time of the first blast,
many people were skeptical whether the project would be completed.
He said that over the years he's seen the dedication of Ziolkowski
and his family keep the dream alive as rock has been steadily
removed from the mountain.
   The project not only draws more than 1 million tourists a year
to help the Black Hills economy, but also helps improve relations
between Indians and non-Indians, the governor said.
   ``We tend to focus too much on our differences, when in fact
this gives us an opportunity to give a prominent role to a great
Indian leader,'' Mickelson said.
   Crazy Horse helped lead the Indians who defeated Gen. George
Custer at the 1876 battle of the Little Big Horn in Montana. But
after he and 1,000 starving followers were forced to surrender, he
was killed by a soldier's bayonet in prison in 1877 at an estimated
age of 34.
   Five Indians who fought with Crazy Horse at Little Big Horn
attended the first blast on the mountain.
   When completed, a statue 563 feet tall and 641 feet long will
show Crazy Horse astride a horse and pointing east to the Plains.
The statue will be so large that all four president's heads on
Mount Rushmore would fit inside Crazy Horse's head, and a 10-story
building could stand in the opening between the horse's back and
the Indian's outstretched arm.
   Ziolkowski said the statue would depict Crazy Horse's answer to
a white man who asked what had become of his lands. Crazy Horse
pointed over his horse's head and replied, ``My lands are where my
dead lie buried.''
   Ziolkowski, an acclaimed self-taught sculptor born in Boston,
worked briefly at Mount Rushmore, but didn't get along with chief
sculptor Gutzon Borglum.
   Then some Sioux leaders asked Ziolkowski to create a monument.
``My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red
man had great heroes, too,'' wrote Chief Henry Standing Bear.
   Unlike Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse is being carved in the round
so it can be viewed from all sides.
   And also unlike Rushmore, Ziolkowski's dream is financed
strictly by private donations and entrance fees. The mountain was
purchased from the federal government and is owned by Crazy Horse
Memorial Foundation.
   About 8.2 million tons of rock have been removed from the
mountain, which can be worked only in the summer, and it is
beginning to take on the rough form of Ziolkowski's dream.
   Family members say they don't know how long the project will
take.
   ``It's 40 years. We started with absolutely nothing. If it
hadn't been for Korczak, nobody would have started it,'' Mrs.
Ziolkowski said. ``As Korczak said, `It isn't how fast you go, it's
that you do it right and you never stop working.'''

Lou Diamond Phillips' latest role is causing controversy among Navajos, but 
South Dakota Sioux are honoring the multiracial actor for his portrayals of 
American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The Sioux have given Phillips, 28, star of the 1987 film "La Bamba," the 
honorary name Starkeeper, publicist Eddie Michaels said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The tribe will officially confer the name on Phillips at a ceremony later this 
year in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts has challenged the casting 
of Phillips as a Navajo policeman in a film based on author Tony Hillerman's 
novel "The Dark Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who played a Mexican-Indian in "Young Guns" and "Young Guns II," has 
said he is part Cherokee, Filipino, Scottish-Irish, Hawaiian and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Paradise, director of the American Indian Registry, said last week that 
Phillips had not provided documentation of his lineage.

   A quarter-million motorcyclists have
converged on this small Black Hills town to enjoy races, tours and
general good times.
   The weeklong 50th Black Hills Motor Classic has turned the town
of 7,000 on the edge of western South Dakota's Black Hills into a
motorcycle mecca.
   ``It's great, mind blowing,'' Marguerite McNeill of Queensland,
Australia, said Tuesday. ``It seems to have all ages. It doesn't
matter what or who you are.''
   Motorcycles are parked on the six blocks of Main Street that
have been blocked off to other traffic. Bikes are parked on both
sides of the street and in double rows down the middle of every
block.
   The visitors included lawyers, bankers, police officers, doctors
and housewives.
   ``This is just unreal to see this many people,'' said Burt
Trumbower, wearing leather and a diamond stud in his left ear, as
he surveyed Main Street. Trumbower, 45, a postal inspector from St.
Paul, Minn., was attending his 17th rally.
   Two wedding parties zoomed up and down the streets, and another
couple was observed taking vows in a nearby park with a bearded,
leather-clad man officiating.
   Some attending the rally belong to established groups, such as
Hell's Angels, Banditos and Sons of Silence.
   The rally started small in 1940, and was dedicated to tours and
races. The races are still held, but over the years the parties
have taken precedence.
   ``I bet most people don't know the races go on,'' said Bruce
Hubbard, president of the Black Hills Motor Classic Board, which is
part of the local Chamber of Commerce. ``They just come to ride
their bikes, maybe drink a couple of beers and talk to their
buddies.''
   The gathering officially began Monday, but bikers began arriving
last week _ along with extra law enforcement offiicers. The rally
runs through Sunday.
   The rally's relatively mellow mood was broken Tuesday night when
police shot and killed a man who'd broken into a home after
pounding a knife blade about 2 feet through a door, authorities
said. The man also had threatened at least one other person and
caused other disturbances, said Mike Jackley, Meade County state's
attorney.
   Authorities would not release the man's name.
   ``This is a very isolated incident,'' said Jackley. ``There's no
good rational explanation for it. I'd say from the reports I've
seen he definitely was not acting rationally.''
   For the most part, the crowd is friendly, said Harold Sykora,
chairman of a task force of state agencies providing support
services for the rally.
   ``They seem to be polite. If you bump into someone on the
street, they'll say `Excuse me' and be on their way. People come
here to have a good time,'' Sykora said.

   The first snow of the season fell in the Rockies Saturday, while
a cold front moving across the Plains into the northern Midwest
brought summerlike conditions to the Northeast.
   As much as 7 inches of snow had accumulated Saturday morning in
the northern and western mountains of Wyoming, and snow was
scattered over the mountains of western Montana and northern Idaho.
   In the northern Black Hills in South Dakota, 3 to 6 inches of
snow was expected to accumulate overnight. Snow over the Black
Hills on Saturday morning changed to scattered showers.
   Advisories were posted for freezing temperatures Saturday night
over North Dakota, western and northern South Dakota, Minnesota and
Upper Michigan. Freezing temperatures also were expected Sunday
morning in western Idaho.
   Temperatures dipped into the low 20s in parts of Colorado,
Idaho, Wyoming and Montana.
   Winds up to 35 mph buffeted parts of the California deserts, and
winds gusted to 45 mph in the southeast highlands of Idaho.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms ranged along the Gulf Coast
from Texas to Florida.
   The cold front moving into the northern Midwest created high
pressure in the Mid-Atlantic region, and the Northeast basked in
temperatures reaching into the mid-80s.
   Hartford, Conn., recorded 86 degrees in the early afternoon,
tying its high for the date set in 1959. Boston reached 86 degrees,
tying a record high for the date set in 1946.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 22 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo., and Kalispell, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at both Gillette, Wyo., and Livingston, Mont., to 98
degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
   Hurricane Klaus weakened to a tropical storm on Saturday and
drifted into the open waters of the Atlantic.
   The Caribbean island of Martinique was by far the hardest hit by
the storm. Heavy rain since Tuesday spawned landslides and serious
flooding that left at least six people dead and 1,500 homeless.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Black Hills gold rush town
where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in an 1876 poker game are
betting a little gambling will restore the local economy by
reviving the spirit of the Old West.
   Voters decide Tuesday whether to allow poker, blackjack and slot
machines in their community of 2,000, known a century ago as the
wildest, wickedest town on the Western frontier.
   At the 85-year-old Franklin Hotel on Main Street, owner Bill
Walsh talked about how Deadwood might secure its future by
promoting its past, particularly the story of Wild Bill, whose
bronzed bust guards the hotel lobby.
   The U.S. marshal and frontiersman was shot in the back of the
head during a poker game at a saloon called No. 10 on Aug. 2, 1876.
Legend has it he was clutching a pair each of aces and eights,
ever-after known by card players as the ``dead man's hand.''
   ``I think that Deadwood's identity, as far as a tourism type of
destination area, has always been tied to Wild Bill Hickok and that
shooting,'' Walsh said. ``When people come to Deadwood, they expect
the Old West.''
   A bit of a betting boom might stop the town's decade-long
economic decline by creating jobs to draw young people back,
supporting services for the elderly and helping to make Deadwood a
center for the arts, he said. Mayor Tom Blair estimated gaming
might generate $500,000 a year for historic restoration.
   ``We want to give that impression of an old Western mining town
in 1889,'' Walsh said. ``While we're trying to go forward
economically, we're going to the past to give us that boost.''
   But some Deadwood residents oppose the gambling plan, which they
doubt will provide much of an economic boost.
   ``There is opposition here in town, and it's asically on moral
grounds,'' said the Rev. Don Hadrick of the United Methodist
Church, adding that opponents have been too intimidated by the
overwhelming support to make much noise. ``It's not popular to be
in the minority on issues such as this.''
   Blair predicted the gambling, limited to $5 bets and 15 games
for each establishment, would attract at least another 200,000
tourists to Deadwood each year, mostly vacationing families
interested in Black Hills recreation.
   ``If you want the glitz and glitter of Atlantic City or the
glamorous entertainmemt of Las Vegas, you've come to the wrong
place,'' Blair said. ``We want the gambling to augment what we are
year 'round: a beautiful part of South Dakota with lots of things
for people to do both summer and winter.''
   Until last year, South Dakota's Constitution forbade all games
of chance except the state lottery and games for charitable,
religious, educational or public-spirited purposes.
   The Deadwood You Bet Committee, made up mostly of local
officials and business owners, has been trying since 1985 to start
limited gambling. The effort paid off in November, when voters
statewide approved a constitutional amendment allowing the
Legislature to authorize limited gambling in Deadwood.
   Lawmakers gave the go-ahead a month ago, but gambling can only
begin if 60 percent of Deadwood voters approve it Tuesday. About 70
percent favored the constitutional amendment in November, and a
recent telephone survey of 900 of Deadwood's 1,200 registered
voters confirmed widespread support, Blair said.
   Deadwood was founded on a desire for wealth and adventure: an
1876 gold strike in Deadwood Gulch brought 7,000 people to the area
in seven months. As Deadwood grew, so did its reputation as the
rowdiest mining town of them all.
   ``Sodom and Gomorrah were both dull, stupid towns compared with
Deadwood,'' author J.W. Buel wrote in an 1886 book called ``Heroes
of the Plains.'' ``In a square contest for the honors of moral
depravity, the Black Hills' capital could give the people of the
Dead Sea cities three points in the game and then skunk them both.''
   Town leaders hope the limited gambling will recall the town's
past without any of the lawlessness. If gambling is approved, the
next 20 years will see the restoration of Deadwood's buildings and
other facilities, the mayor said.
   ``I would hope that as you step back onto Main Street ... that
you really see you're stepping back 100 years in time.''

   A runaway forest fire that swept near Mount
Rushmore before turning aside today charred more than 10,000 acres
and prompted evacuation of up to 1,000 residents and tourists near
the national memorial, authorities said.
   ``When we told them (residents and campers) it was burning 1,000
acres per hour ... and it was three miles away, they kind of
believed us,'' said Sgt. Howard Brunner of the Pennington County
Sheriff's Department, who helped evacuate the town of Keystone late
Wednesday.
   Visitors returned to Mount Rushmore this morning, but it was
accessible only from the west. Superintendent Dan Wenk said smoke
was visible in the distance today, but there was no smoke at the
memorial itself.
   The blaze, which shot billows of smoke so high its pall was
visible 160 miles away Wednesday, also threatened the park's Game
Lodge, summer White House for two presidents. No structures have
been destroyed.
   ``It's a very serious situation,'' Jerry Hagen, fire information
officer with the U.S. Forest Service, said early today. The fire in
Custer State Park and the Black Hills National Forest was within
three miles of Mount Rushmore before switching directions and
heading south, said Richard Hohmann, a spokesman for the state
division of forestry.
   ``The fire behavior was so extreme and erratic that the fire
line was lost several times'' during the night, forcing
firefighters to retreat, Hohmann said.
   Since there are fewer buildings in the southern end of the park,
firefighters can now spend more time battling the blaze and less
time protecting structures, Hohman said.
   An estimated 1,000 firefighters, pilots and rescue personnel are
battling the blaze, Hohmann said. A three-mile-long fire line has
been cleared, but 20 more miles are needed to surround the blaze.
He estimated the line would be completed Sunday night.
   Cooler temperatures and lighter winds were forecast today, which
could help the fire-fighting effort, said Tom Farver, fire
information officer.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, Hagen said.
   All entrances to the park were closed Wednesday.
   The fire was fueled by a continuing drought that has created
extremely dry timber. Smoke was billowing thousands of feet into
the air and the plume was visible from Rapid City 25 miles away. A
haze from the smoke hung over a large part of western South Dakota
and was visible from Pierre, 160 miles away.
   Pennington County sheriff's officials knocked on doors in the
tourist town of Keystone and at the memorial asking people to leave
early today, Hagen said. He estimated between 300 and 400 people
were being evacuated; 600 were evacuated earlier from Custer State
Park.
   ``There was a continuous line of cars from Keystone to Rapid
City, but from all reports it went smoothly,'' Hagen said.
   Keystone, about two miles from Mount Rushmore, has only about
300 residents, but it attracts thousands of tourists. A National
Guard official in Custer estimated Wednesday night that 1,500 to
2,000 people would have to leave the area because it is the height
of the tourist season.
   Neither the town nor the monument was in immediate danger this
morning, but the evacuation was a precaution in case the fire
expands in their direction, said a dispatcher at the fire center
who refused to give his name.
   Employees who work at Mount Rushmore and park officials also
were asked to leave, Hagen said.
   Evacuees fled to a Red Cross shelter in Rapid City or to the
National Guard armory in Custer.
   Menashe and Abigail Barzilai of Winnipeg, Canada, their
month-old baby and two other children were five of the
approximately 170 people who spent the night at the Red Cross
shelter.
   The Barzilais, who had been staying at a Keystone motel, were
evacuated from Mount Rushmore during the evening lighting ceremony,
in which the granite faces are illuminated by floodlights.
   ``We left all of our things in a motel, including the
passports,'' Barzilai said today.
   ``Now we can't go back,'' Mrs. Barzilai said. ``About the fire,
I wasn't worried, but about the passports I was and I don't have
anything for the baby.''
   Authorities believe lightning started the fire in the
north-central part of the 73,000-acre park Monday night. It was not
spotted until Tuesday afternoon.
   The fire burned across the park's northern boundary and entered
Black Hills National Forest land Wednesday night.
   ``It makes you just sick to see the damage that's being done,''
said Gov. George Mickelson, who toured the area by helicopter
Wednesday night.
   Firefighters brought in bulldozers to build a line around the
park's State Game Lodge and sprayed water on it to save it. The
66-year-old lodge was the summer White House for presidents Calvin
Coolidge and Dwight Eisenhower.
   Custer State Park is the second-largest state park in the
nation. It includes the world's largest publicly owned bison herd
at 1,500 animals. The bison graze mostly in the southern part of
the park, away from the fire, but the blaze is burning in some of
the prime habitat for the rare big horn sheep.

   The Navy's newest ship made a splashy debut
as NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw's wife, Meredith, broke a
champagne bottle across the bow of the USS Rushmore to send it into
the muddy waters of the Mississippi River.
   The Rushmore is the second ship named for the Mount Rushmore
National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
   ``We don't get to see many ship launchings in South Dakota,''
Gov. George Mickelson said during christening ceremonies Saturday.
   But Brokaw found parallels between the dry farmland of their
home state and the oceans where the ship will sail.
   ``The people of South Dakota appreciate their oceans of land,''
he said. ``Our ancestors sailed into the state of South Dakota on
prairie schooners.''
   Nearly 300 sailors from South Dakota were killed in World War II
and through the Vietnam War, he said.
   The first USS Rushmore, also an amphibious landing ship, was
launched in 1944 and decomissioned in 1946.

<TEXT>
   The nation's legislators are having their usual headaches over
budgets and taxes, but they've also found time this year to debate
the merits of key lime pie in Florida, banana slugs in California
and gold in them thar Black Hills.
   It's all part of the perennial mania for naming official state
symbols for just about everything under the sun, from state song to
state insect.
   Supporters say the custom can boost tourism, get young people
involved in the political process and provide harmless comic relief
for lawmakers.
   Opponents say it wastes time and money and makes legislators
look foolish.
   ``It gets so tense in there sometimes. It's just too much,''
said Rep. Mary Vanderlinde in South Dakota, where this year's
Legislature designated the triceratops, a plant-eating dinosaur, as
the official fossil and Black Hills gold as the official jewelry.
   ``This livens it up, and then people will relax and get back to
work.''
   Black Hills gold was honored for its economic importance to
South Dakota. About 2,000 people work in the state's mining
industry and 500 more are employed in making jewelry from the gold.
   Minutes after the gold measure was passed by the House in
January, lawmakers adopted a second, tongue-in-cheek resolution
naming Vanderlinde the state's official jewel because she takes
gold shots for arthritis.
   ``Everybody's human, they enjoy a little touch of
lightheartedness like anyone else,'' said Elaine Knapp, an editor
who helps keep track of official state symbols for the Council of
State Governments in Lexington, Ky.
   ``Sometimes it becomes a tool for schoolkids to become involved
in state government and lobby the legislature,'' Mrs. Knapp said.
``It can also be a recognition of certain things that are
indigenous to the state.''
   The latter was the case in Rhode Island, where the Legislature
voted last year to designate the quahog, the Narragansett Indian
name for clam, as the state shellfish. The idea was pushed by a
junior high school shell club.
   ``We are a tourist state ... and we are an ocean state and if
for no other reason, we should recognize our fishing industry,''
said Sen. Jennie D. Day, the bill's sponsor. ``It's quite serious.
It wasn't done in jest.''
   She said the quahog is beginning to appear on tourist
information and billboards.
   Florida's House voted last month to name the key lime pie the
official state pie, inspired by a legislative report that
recommended the honor as ``an excellent way to promote a genuine
Florida product, since the pie can only be properly made with key
limes from Florida.''
   The measure has stalled in the Senate, where Rules Chairman
Dempsey Barron favors sweet potato pie more common to the Panhandle.
   In West Virginia, the Senate named the monarch butterfly the
state insect in response to a campaign by a group of schoolchildren.
   ``People think it's crazy, but you've got to encourage these
kids,'' said Sen. Mario Palumbo. ``This year, one kid got all
dressed up as a monarch butterfly. They were all excited.''
   The House proved less sympathetic, failing even to consider the
measure.
   On Thursday, the California Senate nearly squashed a proposal to
name the banana slug the state's official mollusk. Sen. Becky
Morgan had to settle for a chance to have the proposal reconsidered
in the future.
   ``These things are repulsive, I mean look at them.... The joke
has to stop here,'' said Sen. John Doolittle, as banana slugs oozed
around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of
the upper house in Sacramento.
   No such shenanigans were allowed this year in Indiana, where
House Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler and Senate President Pro Tem
Robert D. Garton specifically warned lawmakers not to introduce
frivolous bills for the biennial short session.
   ``It creates the wrong image for the Legislature,'' said Garton.
``It's a frivolous image. It creates the image that that's all we
do, and it detracts from the serious business.''
   But Mrs. Knapp in Lexington defended the practice of designating
symbols.
   ``It's not something that takes up a great deal of attention or
time,'' she said. ``I don't think anybody expects every minute to
be taken up with something serious. Maybe it's more harmless than
raising taxes.''

legendary Wild Bill Hickok just a few doors down Main Street.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DEADWOOD LIVENS UP WITH LEGALIZED GAMBLING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Destination: South Dakota  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But Goldberg's Grocery, founded in 1876, is no more. It's now Goldberg's
Gaming Hall and Soda Fountain, one of about 80 legal gambling establishments
that have blossomed in historic Deadwood since gambling was legalized 20
months ago.;   Limited gambling -- poker, blackjack and slot machines, with a
$5 bet limit -- became legal Nov. 1, 1989. That made Deadwood, historically
known as a wide-open town where illegal gambling and houses of ill repute
flourished, the third locale in the United States -- after Nevada and Atlantic
City -- to legalize gambling. (Other areas have legal gambling establishments
run by Indian tribes.);   Recently inaugurated Mississippi riverboat gambling
cruises and soon-to-open gaming halls in three Colorado mining towns took
their cue from Deadwood, whose Main Street gaming halls today are clogged with
modern-day fortune hunters.;   They're hoping to strike it rich at the poker
and blackjack tables or the 2,000 or so slot machines at Western-theme
establishments such as The Mother Lode, Calamity Jane's, Hickok's, Durty
Nelly's, Cousin Jack's, Deadwood Dick's, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
and, most recently, the Midnight Star, owned by Kevin Costner and his brother
Don.;   Legal gambling in Deadwood has been phenomenally successful in luring
tourists and generating city revenue and new jobs.;   An early projection by
the Deadwood U-Bet committee, which brought gambling to the city, was that $4
million would be wagered annually. But in the first 19 months, about $440
million was wagered, said Don Gromer, executive secretary of the South Dakota
Gaming Commission. Of that, $7 million to $8 million has gone to Deadwood for
historic preservation.;   Bill Walsh, principal owner of the historic Franklin
Hotel at the upper end of Main Street, estimates the number of tourists
visiting Deadwood has jumped from 250,000 annually before gambling to 1.25
million since. "Our goal is to reach 2 million," Walsh said.;   'Deadwood
would have died'; "Deadwood would have died without this," said Walsh, a
one-time Roman Catholic priest and a leader of the city's U-Bet committee. "We
would have lost all our history. Buildings were burning down right and left.
Fifteen percent of all the historic buildings in South Dakota are on Main
Street.";   They include Walsh's Franklin Hotel, opened in 1903 and once
considered the finest hostelry between Chicago and San Francisco. The hotel is
being restored, in part with preservation funding. Renovated suites go for
$90-plus a night for a double. Most are named after celebrities who have
stayed there.;   Over the years the Historic Franklin, as it is now called,
has hosted such notables as Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Buffalo
Bill, Babe Ruth, John Wayne, Jack Dempsey, Pearl Buck, Lawrence Welk, Casey
Tibbs, Sir John Wedgwood of Wedgwood China fame and, most recently, Kevin
Costner, who was a guest during the filming of the Academy Award-winning
"Dances With Wolves." Much of the movie was filmed nearby.;   Costners opened
casino; So impressed, apparently, was Costner that he and his brother
purchased what had been the New York Store, a clothing shop on Main Street,
and converted it to a gaming hall called the Midnight Star. The Costners
bought the building -- which sold BG (before gambling) for less than $100,000
-- for $1 million, a reflection of the sky-rocketing real estate prices.;  
Perhaps the most plush of Deadwood's gambling parlors, the Midnight Star
opened July 3.;   As a visitor to Deadwood for three consecutive summers, I
have watched gambling transform the city. In 1989, before gambling, Deadwood
was a dying town. In 1990, it was difficult to find a place to eat as retail
establishments were falling to the big bucks of gambling interests.;   Decent
restaurants can now be found, with first-rate rib-eye steaks for as little as
$7 or $8. Live entertainment -- including stage shows -- is now offered at
several establishments; and a decibel limit has been imposed on outdoor
speakers. Some of the Main Street gambling halls have added hotels.;   On the
downside, escalating real estate prices have driven many businesses to the
neighboring towns of Spearfish and Sturgis. The only remaining supermarket is
a Safeway, which has slot machines strategically located near the checkout
counters. Deadwood's auto dealerships have moved to Spearfish, as have other
retail stores.;   Deadwood's 80 or so gaming parlors are concentrated in a
four-block section of Main Street, with a few souvenir shops featuring the
distinctive pink-tinged Black Hills gold jewelry sandwiched in between.;   One
retailer who has held fast, however, is Agnes Ayres, the 74-year-old owner of
Ayres Hardware. A handwritten sign hanging in the door of the store -- founded
by Ayres' ancestors in 1877 -- makes it clear: "Do Not Ask. This Building is
Not For Sale. Don't Even Think About It.";   The Rev. Chuck Horner of
Deadwood's United Methodist Church acknowledges the economic value of
gambling, noting that Deadwood "was becoming a ghost town.";   But he shares
Walsh's concern about the flight of retail businesses from the city. He also
notes a rise in crime, particularly domestic violence and other social
problems such as gambling addiction.;   While it is now legal, gambling is not
a new phenomenon for Deadwood. Illegal but open gambling flourished in
Deadwood until a 1947 crackdown. It continued to operate underground until
1964. Even then, the bet limit was said to be $5.;   Organized prostitution
flourished until 1980, when federal agents closed the brothels by charging the
madams with income tax evasion.;   One of the most notorious of the modern-day
brothels was the Green Doors, which has been converted into a gambling hall
called the Green Doors Club.;   Gambling is far from the only thing Deadwood
has to offer.;   One can almost see such Deadwood characters as Wild Bill
Hickok, Calamity Jane, Preacher Smith, Potato Creek Johnny and Seth Bullock
leap from the pages of the past.;   Each night except Sunday, the capture of
McCall and his trial are re-enacted, beginning with a shootout on Main Street
and then moving to the nearby courtroom. Tourists are chosen as jurors.;  
Best-known of the city's characters is Hickok, who spent only a few months in
Deadwood before Jack McCall shot him in the back in Saloon No. 10. The poker
hand Hickok held -- two black aces, two black eights and the nine of diamonds
-- is still known as the Dead Man's Hand.;   Deadwood has a history unmatched
by many places in the Midwest or elsewhere.;   Gen. George Custer of Little
Big Horn notoriety set off the rush to Deadwood when he confirmed in 1874 that
there was gold in the hills. By 1876, gold seekers had flocked to Deadwood
Gulch, so named because it was filled with dead trees.;   The Gold Rush also
brought to Deadwood perhaps as many as 500 Chinese, who performed much of the
menial labor.;   They established a Chinatown, part of which is still in
evidence along Deadwood's lower Main Street. In addition to the lower Main
Street storefronts, there is a network of hidden passages below street level,
supposedly used by the Chinese to get from their homes to businesses where
they worked. Tours are available.  </TEXT>

   A late-season snowstorm blasted parts of the high Plains on
Friday, while thunderstorms, tornados and hail moved on to bedevil
the South and Midwest after deluging Texas with killer floods.
   In Texas, high winds from at least 18 twisters and large hail
damaged houses and toppled power lines and trees Friday after three
days of severe thunderstorms. No major damage or injuries were
reported.
   But in the East, many were surprised by unseasonable weather of
a different kind: Temperatures soared as high as the low 90s,
toppling records from Cape Hatteras, N.C., to Sault Ste. Marie,
Mich.
   Snow fell over parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska and Wyoming on
Friday, and wind from the icy blast toppled power lines,
temporarily blacking out up to 30,000 homes in the Black Hills of
South Dakota. Power was restored to most customers within two hours
of the early-morning blackout, power company officials said.
   Snow piled up to 7 inches deep in the Black Hills overnight, 6
inches at Gillette, Wyo., and 5 inches at Sundance, Wyo.
   Forecasters warned more snow and freezing rain could fall
Saturday over parts of the Dakotas, western Montana and Idaho.
   Snow was forecast Friday night in the mountains of northeastern
Oregon and the Cascade Range.
   A band of thunderstorms stretched from eastern Texas across to
Alabama and up through the Midwest on Saturday, producing small
hail at Des Peres, Mo., and freezing rain in Minnesota. Tornado
watches were posted in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
   In Texas, some communities ravaged Thursday by the storm system
began to return to normal Friday, but hard-hit Brown and Parker
counties in the north-central part of the state remained flooded.
   Workers struggled Friday to contain at least 2,500 gallons of
crude oil that spilled into Bass Lake, about 120 miles southwest of
Dallas, when pressure from high water burst a pipeline.
   They hoped to stop the oil from flowing down the Sabana River to
Lake Proctor, a water source for three counties.
   The line of storms was forecast to continue east Saturday,
stretching from Alabama to Michigan. Snow or rain was forecast for
the high Plains, while the rest of the country was expected to get
clear or partly cloudy skies.
   Among the spots where temperature records were broken Friday
were Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., 83; Toledo, Ohio, 87; Syracuse, N.Y.,
88; Boston, 92; Newark, 91 and Cape Hatteras, 89.
   The low for the nation this Friday was 19 degrees at Big Piney,
Wyo.

"The Wings of South Dakota.";    An average of just 25 people flew on the

state's large and small cities.;    "We feel bad it wasn't successful, but we
feel it wasn't a total disaster. We learned a lot from it," state
Transportation Secretary Dick Howard said. "We think we'll be back with it."; 
  The airline connected eight cities -- Sioux Falls, Aberdeen, Pierre,
Mitchell, Huron, Brookings, Yankton and Spearfish -- in the sprawling, rural
state. The system flew three routes, all linked to allow transfers in the
state capital of Pierre.;    The state hired GP Express of Grand Island, Neb.,
which provided the planes and flight crews.;    The airline, which had no
name, was designed for business travelers. Schedules allowed them to catch an
early morning flight, conduct business in another city and return in the
evening. One-way fares ranged from $32 to $192.;    For Spencer Ruff, a Sioux
Falls architect, the airline was a godsend. Previously he had endured
eight-hour drives each way to see clients in the Black Hills, 400 miles away.
The airline offered a two-hour flight.;    But Ruff understands why he no
longer has that option: "I sometimes sat on a 14-passenger plane when I was
the only passenger.";    The airline needed to carry 75 passengers a day, but
hauled only a third that number. The state paid $935,000 in subsidies, and
cities on the routes paid $177,000 to keep the planes flying from Oct. 9 until
Feb. 22.;    Subsidies were planned for the next few years until the airline
could survive on fares. But it was shut down after it became obvious that
subsidy payments would have to be much higher than anticipated.;    State
officials plan to study a scaled-down system that would again create an air
network to link South Dakota cities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A powerful late-winter blizzard whitened the Black Hills of
South Dakota, with heavy snow and winds up to 65 mph barreling
through parts of that state, Colorado and Nebraska on Friday before
moving east into Minnesota.
   Blizzard warnings extended from northeast Colorado across the
Nebraska Panhandle and northwest Nebraska into much of South
Dakota. Parts of Interstate 80 in western Nebraska were shut down.
   In South Dakota, Rapid City reported winds of up to 65 mph and
heavy snow. Nearby Lead and Deadwood had up to 3 feet of snow.
Sturgis had 20 inches, Spearfish, 18, and Custer and Hill City 14.
   Snow and strong winds also hammered the Nebraska Panhandle
throughout the morning and afternoon. Wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph
reduced visibility to near zero. Crawford received up to 16 inches
of snow.
   The blizzard also blasted the northeast plains of Colorado,
where winds gusted to 50 mph at Wellington, Akron and Fort Morgan.
   Wind-chill readings across much of North Dakota, were from 10
below zero to 25 below. Some interstates were closed.
   Snow also continued to fall across much of Wyoming, where Rock
Springs received 15 inches, Laramie, 11, and Cheyenne, 7.
   The storm moved slowly northeastward into Minnesota, where up to
3 inches of snow was measured north of Bemidji. Wind gusts of 49
mph were reported at Duluth.
   Elsewhere, cloudy skies prevailed across much of the Great
Lakes, with some snow across Upper Michigan. The rest of the nation
enjoying pleasant weather, with the Southern Plains and Middle and
Lower Mississippi valleys logging temperatures in the 60s and 70s.
The Atlantic Coast states reported readings in the 50s and 60s.
   On the West Coast, skies were mostly clear, except for fog along
the Pacific Northwest coast. Southern California had wind gusts to
40 mph.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 88 at McAllen, Texas.
   Saturday's forecast called for the late-season storm system to
bring widespread showers and thunderstorms from the lower Ohio and
western Tennessee valleys into the lower Mississippi Valley and
western Georgia. Blowing snow was likely from the Middle Missouri
Valley into parts of the Great Lakes. Snow and sleet were forecast
for central Wisconsin, with rain across the lower Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley and scattered snow in the northern Plains and central
Rockies.
   High temperatures should be in the 20s, 30s or 40s across much
of the nation, dipping into the teens across the northern Plains
into northern Minnesota and reaching into the 50s and 60s from the
Pacific Northwest through the southern Rockies, northern Texas, the
middle Mississippi, lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys into parts of

   A blizzard plastered the northern Plains with deep snow driven
by wind up to 65 mph Friday, endangering newborn calves and
stranding travelers along hundreds of miles of blocked highways in
Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming and the Dakotas.
   The storm barreled into Minnesota on Friday night. Blizzard
warnings were issued for the northwestern part of the state, and
wet snow and 35 mph wind made driving hazardous.
   Students heading home aboard two school buses were caught by the
storm Thursday and were spending their second night as guests at
two farms, one of which had no electricity.
   ``We feel it is in the best interest of the public to not, not
go out on the highway,'' said Capt. Pius Ternes of the North Dakota
Highway Patrol. ``We don't want someone getting stranded. It's just
a very dangerous situation.''
   ``We've mostly had people sliding off the road. We're not even
pulling them out. We're just getting people out of the vehicles,''
Nebraska State Patrol dispatcher Alex Haberkorn said in Scottsbluff.
   Several hundred pupils in Colorado spent the night in their
schools. Some travelers tried to sleep on the floors of a
courthouse. North Dakota Capitol workers were sent home Friday
about an hour after they arrived.
   There were numerous minor accidents as vehicles slid on ice and
snow, and many schools closed. Snow plows could not keep up with
blowing, drifting snow in many areas. Wyoming state offices were
closed, although the Legislature met.
   Hard-hit Nebraska was not expected to get relief until late
Friday or early Saturday. The storm was expected to track across
Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   Up to 40 inches of snow fell in two days in the mountains of
Utah at the Alta ski resort, with 37 inches at Snowbird. Three to 4
feet had fallen around Lead and Deadwood, on the edges of South
Dakota's Black Hills. Visibility in areas was down to zero.
   School bus driver Linda Barret and her 13 riders took refuge
Thursday at a farm some 20 miles from Harrisburg, Neb., when the
storm cut visibility, and bus driver Sharon Grubbs and her eight
riders, ages 7 to 13, wound up at a farm 17 miles from Harrisburg,
in far western Nebraska.
   They were still there Friday and planned to spend a second
night. The electricity had been out at the second farm, owned by
Jack and Karen Holt, since late Thursday.
   ``It's kind of like the old days,'' Ms. Grubbs said. She and
Mrs. Holt used a camping stove to cook meals while the children
huddled under blankets.
   Outside Scottsbluff, Neb., Jim and Elizabeth Davis of Hot
Springs, Wyo., spent about 15 hours stuck in their car before they
were rescued Friday. Davis, 68, said he and his 67-year-old wife
had apples and candy, plenty of blankets and a full gas tank.
   For one resort, the storm was too much of a good thing.
   ``We must have close to 4 foot. Even the ski slopes are
closed,'' said Bob Ekeren, manager of the Terry Peak Lodge in the
Black Hills. Snow buried cars at the lodge and would-be skiers
stayed inside Friday morning, he said.
   ``Right now you can't hardly see your hand in front of your
face,'' Ekeren said. ``I've never seen this much snow in my life.
It's just unbelievable.''
   Wind gusting to 60 mph was reported Friday morning at Fort
Morgan, Colo., and to 65 mph at Rapid City, S.D. Western Nebraska
had gusts to 50 mph.
   The wind blew off a 20-by-30 foot section of roof at a Rapid
City hotel, and it landed on three cars. No one was hurt. ``If
there would have been someone down there, it would have killed them
for sure,'' said manager Gregory Lester.
   Friday was the 100th anniversary of the start of the four-day
Great Blizzard of 1888 in the East. That storm claimed 400 lives.
   The weather threatened thousands of newborn calves, and ranchers
in the Nebraska Sandhills region worked around the clock to get
animals to shelter.
   ``The men are just exhausted. ... We worked all night long,''
said Marianne Beel. ``We had 300 calves born yesterday. We're
dragging them in, separating them from their mothers.''
   Dick Kjerstad, chairman of the South Dakota Beef Checkoff
Campaign Committee, said Friday the storm could be a severe blow to
the state's cattle industry. ``If it lasts another day, there could
sure be some big losses,'' he said.
   In the Nebraska Panhandle, all roads in and out of Kimball were
closed and Civil Defense Director Dan Jenson estimated 600
travelers spent the night in the town of 3,800 residents.
   Hotels and motels were filled, and residents opened their homes,
he said. But many spent the night at the Kimball County Courthouse,
and about 200 truckers slept in their trucks.
   ``I've never seen so many gosh-dang people,'' Jenson said.
   Interstate 80 was closed for more than 300 miles, from Walcott,
Wyo., to Rock Springs, Neb., because of snowdrifts and low
visibility. Many other roads also were closed in eastern Wyoming,
including almost 140 miles of Interstate 25, and in western
Nebraska.
   The closing of roads into Laramie, Wyo., marooned skiers at the
Snowy Range ski area, which has no overnight accommodations.
Co-owner Terri Collins said about 180 people spent the night on the
floor and tables and most were too tired Friday morning to go
skiing on 12 inches of fresh snow.
   ``We've got all the roads closed. People have to stay home,''
said Kathy Moan of the Wyoming Highway Patrol. She said roads in
and out of Cheyenne and Gillette were closed and the eastern part
of the state was immobilized Friday morning.
   About 100 miles of Interstate 90 was closed overnight in western
South Dakota, and sections of I-94 were closed in North Dakota.
Several northeastern Colorado highways also were closed, including
sections of Interstates 25 and 70, the State Patrol said.
   In northern Colorado, 250 to 300 of the 1,200 students in the
Weld County School District spent the night in schools because
buses couldn't get them home Thursday, said Superintendent Bob
Gudka.
   ``The kids are having a ball,'' Gudka said. As for the teachers,
he joked, ``we may have to get psychological help for them later
on.''
   He said parents in four-wheel-drive vehicles fetched some
students Friday morning and a few were sent home on a convoy of
buses accompanied by other four-wheel-drives.

<HEAD>Mount Rushmore Reopened After Fire Burns 13,000 Acres</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 23rd graf, `Firefighters gained ...,' to CORRECT that
Shoshone fire contained, not controlled.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters beat back a forest fire that prompted the
evacuation of more than 1,000 people near Mount Rushmore National
Memorial, allowing it to be reopened, while a second blaze nearly
brushed the Alaska Pipeline.
   In South Carolina, a 1,000-acre blaze jumped plowed fire lines
in four locations Thursday and ate up another 150 acres of timber
and brush dried by heat and drought, while land managers in Alaska
took a new tack in their battle against four fires raging over
270,000 acres.
   Fifty percent of South Dakota's Custer State Park fire, which
has burned 16,000 acres, was contained by Thursday night, said fire
information officer Jerry Hagen.
   ``We have 13 miles of fire line built at this point. We have 13
miles to go,'' Hagen said. ``We expect to have the rest of it
contained by 8 p.m. Sunday.''
   The weather was finally working on the side of the firefighters.
Instead of searing temperatures, high wind and low humidity, crews
this morning faced temperatures in the 60s, higher humidity and
light southeasterly winds at 6-10 mph, said Richard Homann, a
spokesman for the state Division of forestry.
   Although authorities today revised the number of acres upward
from Thursday's figure of 13,000, the fire didn't really grow that
much overnight, said Tom Farver, a public information officer with
the state Division of Forestry. He said officials used an infrared
scanner in an airplane Thursday to get a more accurate reading of
the acreage as well as pinpoint hotspots.
   About 1,000 people in or near the park, the town of Keystone and
Mount Rushmore were evacuated Wednesday night as the fire in the
Black Hills National Forest spread northward, but a wind shift
stopped the flames short of the granite monument of four presidents.
   Crews today planned to strengthen the fire lines on the west
edge and southwest perimeter of the blaze, Homann said.
   On Thursday, fire commander Bob Miller said, ``The objective
today was to keep the fire from spreading to the north toward Mount
Rushmore. That was accomplished.''
   ``With the exception of the facilities in Custer State Park the
Black Hills are open,'' said park superintendent Dan Wenk. ``The
fire is in a very small area of the Black Hills.''
   Mount Rushmore and Keystone were reopened Thursday, but Custer
State Park remained off-limits. The fire was four miles east of
Custer today, and Homann said an evacuation plan has been drawn up
for the town.
   The cost to fight the fire thus far is $361,000, and it could
cost $1 million when all the expenses are tallied, Homann said.
   In South Carolina, timberland near Nixonville defied
firefighters by jumping their lines.
   ``If we can get a good, wide break established tonight,
hopefully that'll take care of it,'' said firefighter Mike Remion
Thursday night.
   Instead of using water, firefighters plow up large fire breaks
to starve the fire and stop its spread.
   ``We can keep it under control but it won't actually be out
until we get some rain ... not just a little rain, but a lot of
rain,'' said forestry spokeswoman Jennie Morris.
   In Alaska, firefighters held a blaze in check that had come
within 10 miles of the Alaska Pipeline while land managers altered
their overall strategy because of debilitating smoke.
   ``Their goal has been to stop the fire from getting closer to
the pipeline,'' said Sue Mitchell, an information officer for the
Bureau of Land Management. ``So far, they seem to have been
successful. They have the head of the fire corraled between two
creeks and a fire line.''
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. spokesman Tom Brennan said the
pipeline stands in a large, cleared right-of-way, is constructed of
thick steel that has been heavily insulated, and was not
susceptible to serious damage even if the fire had reached it.
   Northern Alaska's major fires are a 126,000-acre blaze 15 miles
north of Livengood; a 40,000-acre fire near Ambler; a 53,000-acre
fire northeast of Fort Yukon; and a 51,000-acre fire north of
Central. All but the last are manned. More than 600 firefighters
are on the job.
   Elsewhere in a nation made fire-prone by drought and heat:
   _ Low winds and cooler temperatures helped to bring under
control today a 1,300-acre fire ignited by fireworks in Wyoming's
Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   _ Firefighters contained a 1,650-acre fire in Wyoming's Shoshone
National Forest, said incident commander ``Tut'' Anderson. The fire
was started by lightning two weeks ago.
   _ In Yellowstone National Park, three fires covering nearly
1,900 acres of backcountry were being allowed to burn themselves
out.
   _ A 920-acre brush fire in the Los Padres National Forest in
California was nearly encircled Thursday as firefighters made
progress against the slow-moving but stubborn blaze.
   _ Firefighters gained the upper hand Thursday on Utah brush and
range fires that charred more than 5,000 acres in three separate
areas, including 900 acres in Zion National Park.

   All main roads into Custer State Park were
reopened today, a week after lightning sparked a fire that
eventually burned 17,000 acres of timber and came within 3{ miles
of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.
   The fire, which was controlled Sunday afternoon, had been
contained within a 30-mile fire line a day earlier.
   Custer State Park is adjacent to U.S. Forest Service land that
surrounds Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in western South
Dakota. The 73,000-acre park is the second largest state park in
the nation.
   The park was reopened Sunday but visitors were not allowed back
into all of it Sunday because of traffic problems on the narrow
roads as mop-up crews worked, said fire information officer Lynn
Young.
   ``It's not because of the fire but because of all the vehicles
and the buses and the crews moving around doing mop-up,'' Young
said.
   Two fire crews and two engines continued working today, dousing
lingering embers until there is no more smoke. One helicopter also
was kept on alert and a bulldozer was used to clean out fire lines.
   In addition, roads and campgrounds were still being cleared of
fire debris and utility workers were restoring electricity and
replacing utility poles that were burned in the fire, said fire
information officer Richard Homann.
   The fire, which began July Fourth, was contained after
thundershowers moved through and doused the fire with about a
quarter inch of rain, Young said.
   Lightning from the storms started nine additional fires, but
they were handled by local firefighters, he said.
   ``It's enough to keep us a little nervous, but we haven't got a
big one going,'' he said.
   Young said the Black Hills were just entering the main fire
season, but the drought brought fire problems early this year.
   Elsewhere, firefighters in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in
Wyoming contained the last major fire burning in the forest, the
200-acre ``Pocket'' fire, beating a storm front expected to reach
the area later today with high wind.
   However, three fires in Yellowstone National Park covering
almost 1,900 acres continue to burn unchecked, although park
officials said rain slowed the flames somewhat. Because the fires
were started by lightning, officials will allow them to burn unless
the approach the park's northern border.

   Actor Kevin Costner has put up nearly $1
million to help his big brother open a casino in Deadwood.
   Dan Costner, 39, plans to turn a clothing store on Main Street
into a casino, restaurant and bar called the Midnight Star. Kevin,
35, and the clothing store's owners will be minority partners, Dan
Costner said.
   Dan Costner said his brother, star of ``Field of Dreams'' and
``The Untouchables,'' provided most of the $1 million used to buy
the property.
   The older Costner said he and his brother fell in love with the
Black Hills last year during the filming of ``Dances with Wolves,''
which Kevin Costner stars in, co-produced and directed.
   Dan Costner moved from California to Lead to meet state
requirements that majority owners of gambling operations be
residents of South Dakota.
   He hopes to open the casino next year.
   Gambling was legalized in 1989 in Deadwood, the Black Hills gold
rush town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876 while
playing poker.

   Crews using flame throwers fought fire with fire as a blaze
burned within six miles of Old Faithful, and authorities said arson
caused a South Dakota wildfire that destroyed 22 buildings and
forced 1,000 people to flee.
   Wildfires also chased hundreds of people from their homes in
Idaho, while in Alaska 1,200 firefighters battled wind-fanned
blazes that consumed 1.3 million acres, an area larger than
Delaware.
   Large fires, many of them kindled in drought conditions
aggravated during a hot, dry summer, also blackened regions in
Arizona, Oregon, Utah, Washington state and Montana.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel took a helicopter tour Wednesday
through thick smoke to view 10,000 charred acres in the southern
areas of Yellowstone National Park, which is suffering its worst
forest fire of the century. The blaze has scorched 109,000 of the
park's 2.2 million acres.
   Firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters lit
backfires in about 1,000 acres of meadow to burn fuel ahead of the
fire and direct it away from Old Faithful, the park's most famous
attraction, and nearby structures.
   Even so, the usual hundreds of summer visitors gathered every 75
minutes or so Wednesday to watch the famous geyser erupt into the
smoky sky.
   ``Fantastic,'' said Alain Dukan of France. ``We're not afraid of
the fires and we're not worried about it. They say fire is part of
the forest.''
   In South Dakota, firefighters worked around the clock to dig a
fire line around a 2,200-acre blaze that burned out of control in
heavy woods within two miles of Rapid City, and the fire was
declared 80 percent contained today. The fire destroyed 22
structures, including seven houses.
   On Wednesday night, officials thought 2,000 people had evacuated
their homes, but they said today their best estimate was that only
1,000 people left their homes. About half of them were allowed to
return home today.
   Don Kopp, a fire commander, said Wednesday the blaze was the
work of an arsonist.
   ``Whoever's doing it, they could burn down half of the Black
Hills if they want,'' said Kopp, adding that authorities have been
investigating a string of about 50 fires dating to May which they
suspect were set by the same person.
   He said a cigarette with a match inside was used to start the
fire that was spotted Tuesday. Such a device would smolder for a
time before bursting into flame.
   ``I'm not sure what we need to do to catch them, but we need to
catch them,'' Kopp said. The suspected arsonist has set as many as
to eight fires in one day, he said.
   In Idaho, a temperature inversion kept winds mercifully light as
crews worked to keep a 1,700-acre fire away from about 50 homes in
the Boise National Forest, 35 miles north of Boise.
   ``The fire is pretty active and moving to the southeast,'' said
Karen Palmer, Forest Service fire information officer. ``We don't
have a big handle on how much it's burned because there's so much
smoke.''
   Winds helped Alaska's largest fire grow to 409,000 acres, said
Sue Mitchell, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman. Most Alaska
fires were in remote areas and were let alone because they don't
threaten people or property.
   In Washington, more than 350 firefighters battled a fire fanned
by 20 mph winds and temperatures near 90, which raced across the
ridge of the Cascade Mountains on Wednesday, tripling its size to
3,600 acres within a few hours. Firefighters in northeastern Utah,
meanwhile, used a rainstorm to contain a 5-day-old,
fireworks-caused blaze that charred 1,955 acres in the Flaming
Gorge National Recreation Area.
   Firefighters also contained a lightning-sparked wildfire that
burned an estimated 3,400 acres of remote terrain in northwestern
Arizona. About 50 people evacuated because of a 650-acre blaze in
Montana expected to go home today. About 70 homes were evacuated
Wednesday at Coulterville, Calif., because of a brush fire blamed
on a careless smoker.
   In Yellowstone, Hodel voiced confidence in the National Park
Service's controversial ``let it burn'' philosophy for wilderness
areas in which people, buildings or roads are not endangered. But
he said the excessively dry conditions might make a difference.
   ``The problem is to decide when you have a prescribed burn or
when you have a fire you want to fight,'' Hodel said. ``In the dry
conditions, they're taking the view that any fire that begins they
will try to fight it.''
   Ben Clary, Yellowstone assistant superintendent, said park
officials largely will follow the existing policy on natural fires.

   A major snowstorm that dumped up to 7 feet of snow shut down
travel in the upper Midwest Saturday and whipped up 15-foot waves
on Lake Superior, while crews worked to reopen highways across the
Plains where hundreds of people had been snowbound for two days.
   ``It's a little better than yesterday but not much,'' said
Roberta Welsh, Nebraska State Patrol dispatcher at Scottsbluff.
   A South Dakota woman was killed Saturday when her car skidded
and rolled over on an icy interstate, the state Highway Patrol said.
   High school basketball fans spent the night stuck in a Minnesota
arena after a regional playoff, and two busloads of Nebraska
schoolchildren snowbound at isolated farms got to go home.
   Up to 7 feet of snow stranded skiers on Terry Peak in South
Dakota's Black Hills and 15-foot drifts were reported near Badlands
National Park. In the hard-hit Nebraska Panhandle, 31 inches of
snow was reported at Chadron, with 10-foot drifts at Crawford.
   The Cheyenne County, Neb., sheriff's department worked through
the night and all day Saturday to reach people believed stranded in
vehicles in the Sidney area, said dispatcher Harlan Sage.
   ``We'll be lucky if we don't find someone out in the country ...
dead possibly,'' said Kimball ambulance director Jim O'Brien and
Kimball County Sheriff John Thacker Jr. They said the storm was the
worst to hit western Nebraska in at least 18 years.
   An elderly couple from Springview, Neb., were rescued Saturday
by a relative on a snowmobile after spending the night stuck in
their pickup, said Keya Paha County Sheriff Gary Sell.
   Blowing snow kept visibility down to about one-quarter of a mile
around O'Neill, Neb., forcing the town to cancel its annual St.
Patrick's Day celebration, said Holt County sheriff's dispatcher
Arlene Fox.
   More than a foot of snow fell Saturday in sections of northern
and central Minnesota, and it was whipped up by 50 mph wind that
closed the Duluth airport for six hours. Waves estimated at 15 feet
topped some seawalls along Lake Superior, the National Weather
Service said.
   Hundreds of Hutchinson High School girls' basketball fans,
including the school band, were stranded overnight in Mankato,
Minn., by snow and zero visibility after a victory in regional
playoffs. The seven busloads of fans stayed in Mankato State
University's arena while the team got motel rooms. The motel said
they checked out Saturday morning.
   Up to 10 inches of wet snow was dumped on northern Wisconsin,
miring countless vehicles on highways near Lake Superior.
   ``It looks like everybody's on an ego trip, wanting to see how
far they can go'' before their cars get stuck, said police Capt.
Jerry Moe at Superior, Wis., just across the lake from Duluth.
   Snow also fell across northern Michigan. ``We're getting a
blizzard,'' said state police Sgt. Larry Brown at St. Ignace at the
southeastern tip of the Upper Peninsula.
   On Terry Peak in the Black Hills, skiers had been snowbound
since Thursday, and Terry Peak Lodge manager Bob Ekeren said 7 feet
of snow had fallen by Saturday. ``We're out of bread and meat and
potatoes. We're making soup.''
   ``There's three, four feet of snow on top of cars. We can't even
find them,'' Ekeren said at the lodge, at an elevation of 6,700
feet.
   Crews in Wyoming, Nebraska and South Dakota worked Saturday to
reopen roads that had been closed by drifting snow and zero
visibility, some since Thursday.
   More than 200 miles of Interstate 80 across Wyoming and into
western Nebraska reopened Saturday and north-south I-25 was
reopened in Wyoming. But many other roads in eastern Wyoming
remained closed, the Highway Patrol said.
   The reopening of I-80 allowed travel for the first time since
Thursday out of Kimball, Neb., where some 700 people had been holed
up by Saturday in motels, private homes and the Kimball County
Courthouse. ``We're getting some people down the road,'' said Carl
Farmer of the sheriff's office.
   Conditions in Kimball were ``a tad better. We can see across the
street but we've got a long ways to go,'' said a woman who answered
the phone at the Kimball civil defense office Saturday morning.
   A 200-mile section of I-94 in North Dakota, closed Friday
afternoon, was reopened Saturday. Parts of a 265-mile section of
I-90 in South Dakota were reopened but a 75-mile section between
Kadoka and Ellsworth Air Force Base remained closed, with 15-foot
drifts in the Kadoka area, said Highway Patrol Lt. Ed Assman.
   Residents of Rapid City, S.D., began digging out under bright
sunshine but some people were stranded in their homes with drifts
up to the second floor.
   The storm caused the South Dakota Democratic Party to postpone a
statewide caucus called for Saturday, when the party was to decide
how to apportion 15 of the state's national convention delegates.
The caucus was rescheduled for the following Saturday.
   Two busloads of children who had been stranded in isolated
farmhouses in western Nebraska since Thursday got home safely
Saturday afternoon. The 21 children were being driven home from
school when the sudden blizzard caught the drivers by surprise.
   Road crews reached driver Sharon Grubbs and her riders, ages 7
to 13, Saturday at the farm of Jack and Karen Holt, about 17 miles
from Harrisburg. All the children left the farmhouse and Ms. Grubbs
said she probably would try to drive the school bus home Saturday
night.
   Mrs. Holt and her visitors were without electricity from
Thursday night to Saturday morning.
   Driver Linda Barrett and her 13 passengers were able to leave
Agnes Wynne's farm when roads were cleared Saturday.
   A neighbor on a snowmobile took buffalo meat, eggs and bread to
the Wynne farm Saturday morning because food was running short,
Mrs. Barrett said.

<HEAD>Debates On Ballot Issues Overshadow Other Campaigns In South Dakota</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bitter debates on a proposed tax limit and
two measures aimed at protecting the Black Hills from surface mining
dominated the campaign in South Dakota, where the presidential race
appeared very close heading into Tuesday's election.
   State party officials described the battle between George Bush
and Michael Dukakis as a tossup, and the two candidates made late
campaign appearances to bid for the farm vote that could decide who
takes South Dakota's three electoral votes.
   The harshest words of the campaign were exchanged by supporters
and opponents of a proposed constitutional amendment to limit
property taxes and two measures calling for stricter reclamation
standards and higher taxes on surface mines. A plan to allow limited
gambling in Deadwood faced no organized opposition.
   Democratic Rep. Tim Johnson appeared to have a comfortable lead
as he sought a second term as South Dakota's lone member of the U.S.
House.

   Long strings of motorcycles roared out of
western South Dakota on Sunday as the weeklong 50th Black Hills
Motor Classic came to a violence-marred end.
   The event drew an estimated 300,000 bikers to the area. Its
mostly peaceful, festive mood was dampened by a Saturday night
shooting and stabbing brawl involving the Outlaws and Sons of
Silence motorcycle gangs. Three men were injured.
   By Sunday, the event had claimed 11 lives. Nine people died in
traffic accidents, one person was killed by carbon-monoxide
poisoning in a tent, and police shot and killed a knife-wielding
Australian man who charged the officers.
   Law officers issued 1,060 traffic tickets and 2,143 warnings,
and made 202 drunken driving and 73 drug arrests. Officials
reported 133 traffic accidents, 78 involving injuries.
   The fight occurred Saturday night at Gunner's Lounge and Casino
on Main Street, usually a hangout for Hells Angels during the
event, officials said. Two Sons of Silence members were
hospitalized in stable but serious condition Sunday with stab
wounds, said Meade County Sheriff Floyd Cleland. A member of the
Outlaws was treated for gunshot wounds and released.
   The stabbing victims will be charged with aggravated assault,
and the gunshot victim may also be charged, Cleland said.
   ``It sure puts a damper on people having a good time,'' said
Matt Waller of Gillette, Wyo., who operated a food stand near the
Main Street bar where the fight occurred.
   By Sunday morning, the scene on Main Street appeared to return
to normal. Bikers again rode and walked the route around a huge
cluster of motorcycles parked down the center and along the length
of the street.
   The violence didn't take anyone by surprise.
   ``As I've said before, the potential is there,'' Cleland said.
``These people all drink booze, take drugs and carry knives and
guns.''
   ``With this amount of people, you know there's going to be
things happen. There's going to be accidents. There's going to be
fights,'' said Bill Kienast, who works at a truck-building company
in Oshkosk, Wis.
   Marcy Myhre, executive director of the Sturgis Area Chamber of
Commerce's Black Hills Motor Classic Board, noted that last year's
rally drew only 60,000 people.
   The week went well, except for a few incidents of violence, she
said. ``We put a lot of effort into it, and it's too bad things
like that have to happen.''
   Some Sturgis residents have tried to stop the rally, but most
seem to accept and even enjoy the crowds that invade the town of
7,000 one week each year. According to conservative estimates, the
bikers and other visitors spent at least $34 million in the town
and surrounding Black Hills.
   ``A lot of them feel it was a little too much, but a lot of them
realize this is a once-in-a-lifetime crowd, too,'' Myhre said.
   Sturgis residents Ken and Barb Grosch were on Main Street
Saturday night _ before the riot _ recorded images of people and
motorcycles with a video camera.
   ``It's nice to see a small, boring town come alive,'' said Mrs.
Grosch. ``I think it's great, but after a week or so I'm ready to
see them go home.''
   Main Street was the center of activity, with thousands of
motorcycles parked in the middle of the street and at the curb, and
bikers sporting leather and tattoos as they gathered around their
``hogs.''
   Merlin Rosen, a veterinary student from Fort Collins, Colo.,
posed with two boa constrictors wrapped around her neck and arms.
   ``Everybody has to stop and look, and there's always the
attraction of being seen,'' she said.
   Biker gangs weren't the only ones who showed up for the week of
races and other events. There are many motorcycle enthusiasts among
the well-heeled; the late Malcolm Forbes attended last year's rally.

IN THE SPIRIT OF CRAZY HORSE by Peter Mathiessen Harvill Pounds 9.99, 646
pages
IF YOU think Rodney King got a bum deal, spare a thought for Leonard
Peltier. Since 1977, the American Indian activist has been serving a double
life sentence for the murder of two FBI agents after having been convicted
on the flimsiest of evidence.
Unfortunately for Peltier, there was nobody with a camcorder on the scene to
show what really happened. On the other hand, he does have Peter Mathiessen,
the distinguished writer and traveller, whose In the Spirit of Crazy Horse,
now released after nine years of legal wrangling, comprehensively proves
that Peltier is the victim of a perversion of justice every bit as cynical
as the one that caused the recent rioting in Los Angeles.
Peltier is a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), a radical civil
rights organisation set up the 1960s to agitate on behalf of North America's
beleaguered native people. After a series of heated confrontations with
white authority, most notably occupations of Alcatraz Prison and Wounded
Knee, site of the 1890 massacre of innocent Sioux by the US Cavalry, AIM
were targeted by the FBI as a subversive organisation on a par with the
Black Panthers and the Weather Underground.
AIM's activity soon came to be centred on the sprawling Pine Ridge
Reservation in South Dakota, home of the Sioux descendants of Crazy Horse,
where violence, fuelled by government-sponsored goon squads, had become
endemic. The inevitable shoot-out took place in June 1975, leaving two
Federal agents and one Indian dead.
Although 30 AIM warriors were on the scene when the shooting occurred, only
four were charged, and just one, Peltier, was convicted. Even before the
prison door rang shut, however, gaping holes in the Government's case became
apparent. Ballistics reports had been doctored and denied, prosecution
witnesses coached and intimidated - the government never even established
that Peltier was on the scene, much less that he was the triggerman. As
Mathiessen patiently establishes, it was prejudice and a thirst for revenge,
rather than reason and prudence, that put Peltier behind bars.
But Mathiessen does more than simply unravel the government's prosecution.
He also establishes how the US government, through a policy that vacillated
between neglect and hostility, created the murderous atmosphere at Pine
Ridge, an atmosphere in which the seemingly cold-blooded execution of two
law enforcement officers could be seen as an act of self-defence.
The author then shows how the two agents may very well have caused their own
death by bursting into an Indian camp in a botched attempt to draw fire,
whereupon they could call in the cavalry to finish off AIM. But Mathiessen
lays ultimate blame for the whole affair at the feet of the military and
industrial interests who saw AIM preventing them from grabbing the rich
uranium deposits beneath the Black Hills badlands where the Sioux had been
exiled a century earlier.
Not surprisingly, Mathiessen's impassioned yet cogent book brought down the
ire of the authorities when first released in 1983, inspiring some Dollars
50m worth of libel suits which caused it to be withdrawn from circulation
for nearly a decade while the author and his publishers defended themselves
in court. Thankfully, Mathiessen kept on the case during the years, coming
up with an epilogue that provides what is perhaps the book's most
sensational bit of reportage - an interview in 1990 with a hooded, anonymous
AIM warrior who admits that it was he, not Peltier, who gunned down the two
agents at close range.
One of the book's most gratifying elements is the manner by which Mathiessen
balances his outrage at the treatment of Peltier and his people with the
cold, cool tone of the investigative reporter. He lets everyone have their
say, be they drunken goons or dedicated warriors, gung-ho FBI agents or
wizened Sioux medicine men. In the end, you are left with the feeling that
everybody involved with the shootings at Pine Ridge was a victim of a
government engaged in strip-mining not just the land but an entire people's
culture.
Upon finishing this book, one finds it impossible to believe that Peltier
can still be in prison. Perhaps the coming Oliver Stone film based on the
book will finally set the man free. And lest British readers feel too smugly
critical about the American judicial system as it lies exposed here, they
should bear in mind the fact that eight US courts defended Mathiessen's
constitutional right to express the opinion that various officials, from the
Governor of South Dakota right down to FBI Field agents, behaved like liars,
thugs and conspirators. In the British courts, he would have been paying out
money to the men who railroaded Peltier until long after the prisoner had
finished his term.

<TEXT>
   Activists Abbie Hoffman and Dennis Banks, who've run afoul of
the law in bucking the system, say they've also learned how to make
a buck during their years as political gadflies.
   Hoffman, the antic activist who once offered a pig as a
presidential candidate, says he's been cutting it up long enough to
know how to work an audience as a comedian, rather than just as an
advocate who uses humor.
   Banks, the former Indian activist, noted that something good has
come of all his economic development work in South Dakota. He and
his wife have decided to open a limousine service there.
   Hoffman speaks at more than 50 university campuses a year at
$3,000 an appearance, but the 51-year-old former Yippie was in San
Juan Capistrano, Calif., on Tuesday for a comedy gig at the Coach
House.
   ``This isn't new, this comedy stuff, because I was a bit of a
stand-up comedian during the '60s,'' said Hoffman, who gained
notoriety as one of the Chicago Seven defendants charged with
inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic national convention.
   ``The difference is that, in the '60s, they shot and threw bags
of garbage at me, so this seems pretty tame by comparison,'' he
said.
   Banks said recently he plans to open a limousine stall at the
Rapid City Regional Airport terminal and operate a shuttle between
there and Rapid City and Pine Ridge. He also wants to add one or
two 15-passenger vans to the business.
   Banks' Limousine Service,``specializing in your taste for the
finer things in life,'' will offer free roses or a bottle of
non-alcoholic champagne to customers.
   His market will include airport travelers, tourists who want a
private ride through the Black Hills and Indian, and government
officials who travel regularly between Pine Ridge and Washington,
D.C., Banks said.
   ``I thought there was a market there because I had been
experimenting with economic development in the past two or three
years since I got out,'' said Banks, referring to his release from
prison in South Dakota.
   Banks, 56, became famous during the tumultuous days of American
Indian Movement activism, which peaked in 1973 during the
occupation of Wounded Knee. He served about one year in prison in
connection with the 1973 riot at the Custer County Courthouse.

<HEAD>Officials Seek Ways To Combat Isolation of Rural America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bus that stops in Rushville five days a
week is a lifeline for 72-year-old Evelyn Trenkle.
   But she and the other 1,200 residents in the northwestern
Nebraska town face losing their bus service and joining the ranks
of thousands of rural Americans who live beyond the scope of
scheduled bus, rail and air service.
   ``We're just so isolated out here, I don't know what we'd
without it,'' said Mrs. Trenkle.
   Rushville, near the South Dakota border, is 400 miles from Omaha
and 30 miles from Chadron, the nearest community of any substance.
   Arrow-Black Hills Stage Lines runs the bus that stops in
Rushville. Two years ago, the company announced it would
discontinue the route, from Rapid City, S.D., to Omaha, because of
low ridership, said Jim Maly, schedule manager.
   The bus is still running because towns along the route joined
with the state and federal governments to work out a subsidy, but
the bus could be threatened again when the subsidy runs out, Maly
said.
   The isolation of rural America concerns not only residents, but
also the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   ``Too often, if you live in a rural community, the bus may no
longer come to town, nor may rail or air service be available,''
said Martin Fitzpatrick Jr., administrator of the Agriculture
Department's Office of Transportation.
   ``Many rural communities are now truly at the end of the line,
with limited access to any form of public transportation,''
Fitzpatrick said.
   His office, along with the U.S. Department of Transportation's
Urban Mass Transportation Administration and the United Bus Owners
of America, have spent a year studying rural transportation
problems.
   That work will culminate with a three-day conference beginning
Monday in Omaha to develop a plan to ``reconnect rural America.''
Among those scheduled to speak are Gov. Kay Orr, Sen. Larry
Pressler of South Dakota, and Rep. Virginia Smith of Nebraska.
   ``During the last year, a new effort has begun to reconnect
rural America. We hope this national meeting will consolidate those
efforts for the future,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   ``We've learned that while service to rural communities indeed
has been lost in many cases, there are a variety of ways rural
transportation needs can be met,'' he said.
   ``For example, flexible point-to-point routes tailored to
particular passenger needs are beginning to take the place of
traditional, fixed-route systems. Also, rural passenger needs
sometimes can be dovetailed with the shipment of goods in sparsely
populated areas.''
   Steve Sprague, the United Bus Owners' vice president for
government affairs, said the conference should provide a blueprint
for both governmental agencies and transportation providers.
   ``We want to try to pick and choose the most appropriate way
communities and states can begin to build that intercity
transportation service,'' Sprague said. ``When we walk away from
Omaha we will know, hopefully, what are the best patterns to
pursue.''
   While Sprague concedes that many see the 1,600 bus owners and
operators represented by his group as part of the problem, he says
the association's participation in the yearlong study proves the
group wants to be part of a solution.
   Federal, local or state subsidies for private carriers serving
rural America can help solve the problem, he said.
   ``There is a middle ground somewhere between full public and
fully private transportation that has not been identified for rural
communities,'' he said.
   But even with boosts like the subsidy provided to the Rushville
bus route, service is far from guaranteed there. The $200,000
subsidy is a fixed sum, and Arrow-Black Hills will have to
re-evaluate continuing the service when the money runs out, Maly
said.
   While many stranded by the loss of bus service stay home when
they're lonely or ill, Mrs. Trenkle says she would move to a town
with bus or rail service.
   ``I don't believe I would stay here; I just couldn't,'' she
said. ``I wouldn't be able to get anywhere. There are a lot of
people like me who are elderly and can't drive too far who need the
bus service.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky, Indiana, Idaho and Minnesota voted to establish state
lotteries, while South Dakota endorsed legalized gambling in
Deadwood, the Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned
down playing poker 112 years ago.
   Voters in South Dakota approved by nearly a two-thirds margin
Tuesday a constitutional amendment giving the Legislature authority
to set regulations for gambling. Deadwood voters ultimately will
have to approve the idea by 60 percent.
   The plan would permit slot machines and card games, with proceeds
going toward historic preservation in the town.
   In Kentucky, voters approved by 61-39 percent an amendment
allowing a lottery.
   The vote was a ``victory for Kentucky's children, senior citizens
and Vietnam veterans,'' Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said. He asked the
General Assembly to enact lottery legislation during a special
session beginning Nov. 28.
   In Indiana, voters approved by a 5-3 margin a proposition to
remove the state constitution's ban on lotteries and other forms of
gambling.
   ``The legislators still have to approve a lottery,'' said Paul R.
Oakes, chairman of an anti-gambling group. Legislators in January
begin deciding how a lottery will be run and how its projected $150
million in annual revenue will be spent.
   In Idaho, pro-lottery forces overcame a media blitz by opponents
and narrowly won support for a constitutional amendment authorizing
a lottery.
   In Minnesota, a state lottery measure was approved 59 percent to
41 percent.
   Since approval of a constitutional amendment requires a majority
of all voters casting ballots, a 60 percent majority is generally
considered the minimum needed to ensure passage because many voters
skip the constitutional questions.
   The Minnesota Legislature now must decide whether a lottery will
actually be established.

<TEXT>
   Wild Bill Hickok was shot in the head
during a poker game in Deadwood more than a century ago, but the
city's voters have bet that restoring gambling will give a shot in
the arm to the gold-rush town's economy.
   Residents voted 690-230 Tuesday to allow poker, blackjack and
slot machines, with the city's cut of the proceeds to be used to
restore and preserve buildings in the historic Black Hills
community of 2,000.
   An amendment to the South Dakota Constitution last year provided
that gambling limited to $5 bets would be permitted in Deadwood if
60 percent of the city's voters approved it.
   South Dakota is the third state to allow casino gambling,
joining New Jersey and Nevada.
   Melodee Nelson, head of the Deadwood You Bet Committee, said
legalized gambling should boost the economy, increase tourism,
create jobs and help hold down property taxes.
   ``But let's all remember it's first and foremost a funding
mechanism for historic preservation,'' she said. ``That's what it
started out as. That's what it's always been.''
   Supporters hope the games can begin this summer, said Bill
Walsh, owner of the 85-year-old Franklin Hotel. He said the
restoration of gambling is about as important as the arrival of the
first train in 1890.
   ``It's here, and we want to all jump on the train and ride this
thing for the betterment of the city of Deadwood and the state of
South Dakota,'' he said.
   About 50 supporters of the measure gathered Tuesday night in the
hotel lobby, which is guarded by a bust of Hickok.
   But their celebration was subdued by the outcome of the mayoral
election. Mayor Tom Blair, a gambling supporter, ran into trouble
in his re-election bid. Blair finished second in a three-way race,
and now will face first-place finisher Bruce Oberlander in a runoff
in two weeks.
   Some residents quietly opposed a return to gambling on moral
grounds, and argued that the games wouldn't provide that much of an
economic boost.
   ``I don't know that I'm as disappointed as much as I'm hurt by
this, when people aren't looking at moral issues here,'' said the
Rev. Don Hadrick of the United Methodist Church in Deadwood.
   Supporters think gambling will help make the area a final
destination for tourists, instead of just a stop on the way to
Yellowstone National Park, the Rocky Mountains or Mount Rushmore
National Monument, which is about 50 miles away.
   They have predicted gambling could attract at least 200,000
additional tourists a year. It also could provide $500,000 annually
to further promote tourism by restoring an Old West look to the
city founded when miners flooded the area afer the 1876 discovery
of gold in Deadwood Gulch.
   Before gambling begins, a South Dakota Gaming Commission will be
appointed to write regulations.
   Deadwood owes much of its tourism reputation to Hickok, the U.S.
marshal and frontiersman who was shot in the back of the head in
1876 during a poker game in a saloon called No. 10. Legend has it
he was holding a pair each of aces and eights, known since as the
``dead man's hand.''
   Gambling has been illegal in South Dakota for about 100 years,
but illegal games flourished openly in Deadwood saloons as recently
as the 1930s and '40s.
   A law passed by the Legislature this year gave the state 40
percent of any gambling taxes and other revenues, with Lawrence
County to get a 10 percent cut. The city of Deadwood was left with
all the tax and fee revenue remaining after the expenses of
regulating the games are paid.

   A forest fire that consumed more than 4,000 acres of timber in
South Dakota's Custer State Park burned to within 4{ miles of Mount
Rushmore late Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of
people over 40 square miles.
   The evacuation, which involved 600 people earlier Wednesday, was
broadened when the fire burned across the park's northern boundary
Wednesday night and entered Black Hills National Forest, site of
the granite memorial to four presidents.
   Gov. George Mickelson said it was likely the fire would get
worse.
   ``It makes you just sick to see the damage that's being done,''
he said after touring the area by helicopter.
   Afternoon winds hampered efforts to douse a 1,500-acre fire in
the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming, but crews in the
Shoshone National Forest to the north were controlling the way a
1,650-acre fire was burning.
   Three other fires in Wyoming covered about 1,900 acres of
backcountry in Yellowstone National Park, while firefighters
battled 850-acre blazes in both a Utah park and a Southern
California forest.
   The three other Wyoming fires, one of which covered 1,800 acres
in the northwestern corner of the park, were set by lightning
strikes. Park crews were allowing them to burn because the fires
were not threatening any structures.
   Extremely dry conditions in Custer State Park were contributing
to the spread of the South Dakota fire, which authorities believe
was started by lightning Monday night.
   Firefighters had difficulty building a fire line because the
blaze was burning in a very steep, rocky area, fire spokesman Jerry
Hagen said. Planes were dropping fire-retardant chemicals once an
hour, but Hagen said the fire was nowhere near being contained.
   The fire earlier was estimated at 6,000 acres, but Hagen said
thick smoke made that number faulty, and it was revised to 4,000
acres.
   About 125 people living around Mount Rushmore National Memorial
were told to leave their homes late Wednesday night as a
precaution, said Custer County Sheriff Vernon Sprague.
   Officials also advised residents of Keystone, about two miles
from Mount Rushmore, to go to a Red Cross shelter in Rapid City or
an armory in Custer. Although Keystone only has about 300
residents, officials said up to 2,000 people might be in the area
because it's the height of the tourist season.
   Hagen said the 40-square-mile area area evacuated was mainly
national forest land but added, ``It looks to me like there's some
private land, some homes and some mining claims.''
   One firefighter was hurt, but his injury was not believed
serious, Hagen said.
   Smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air, with the plume
visible in Rapid City, 25 miles away. A haze from the smoke hung
over a large part of western South Dakota and was visible from
Pierre, 160 miles away.
   All entrances to the park were closed Wednesday and 600 people
were evacuated. Authorities said no structures had burned, but
buildings were not considered safe.
   The fire had been burning toward the northeast but switched to
the northwest Wednesday and was 7-8 miles south of Mount Rushmore
National Memorial.
   Mickelson declared an emergency, releasing state resources to
fight the blaze, and planned to view the fire by helicopter, said
his press secretary.
   In Wyoming, gusting winds that spread the fire in the
Bridger-Teton forest Tuesday built again Wednesday afternoon,
threatening crews' hopes of containing the blaze by evening, said
forest spokesman Fred Kingwill.
   A volunteer firefighter was taken to the Salt Lake City Burn
Center with serious burns on his hands, arms and chest, Kingwill
said.
   The fire, burning in sagebrush, juniper and aspen groves near
the southern end of Fremont Lake, was sparked by Fourth of July
revelers, the Forest Service said.
   In the Shoshone National Forest, fire commander ``Tut'' Anderson
said, ``The fire now is responding to our management as opposed to
us responding to the fire behavior.'' The blaze was touched off by
lightning almost two weeks ago.
   In Utah's Zion National Park, firefighters carved fire lines
around half a blaze that blackened heavy oak and manzanita brush
and Ponderosa pine, officials said.
   About 120 firefighters were battling the lightning-caused blaze,
and another 80 were standing by, said Park Superintendent Harry
Grafe.
   The fire began June 19 and was allowed to burn in a small area
until Sunday, when winds up to 60 mph spread the flames, said Chief
Ranger Bob Andrew.
   Winds eased to 10 mph Wednesday and Andrew said fire bosses
predicted they would contain the blaze by Thursday evening.
   No injuries or property damage were reported.
   Another southern Utah fire broke out and consumed about 3,000
acres by late Wednesday on Bureau of Land Management and private
land about 3 miles north of Beryl , fire dispatcher Wayne Hunt
said. The cause was undetermined.
   About 290 firefighters as well as air tankers battled a brush
fire in Los Padres National Forest near San Luis Obispo in Southern
California, authorities said.
   Temperatures were in the 90s, humidity was low and moderate
winds of 5 mph to 15 mph fanned the blaze but no structures were
threatened, said Juanita Freel, a forest spokeswoman.
   The cause of the blaze, which broke out Tuesday afternoon, was
undetermined.
   In Kentucky, state forestry officials responded to 26 fires on
567 acres Tuesday, spokesman Townley Bergmann said. At least three
of the fires reported Tuesday remained burning Wednesday and 14 new
fires were reported by Wednesday afternoon.

   High winds and dry tinder fueled a fire
that was burning uncontrolled Sunday night in the Black Hills
National Forest, authorities said.
   ``It is a very large fire,'' said Dick Hawthorne, a dispatcher
at the U.S. Forest Service's Pactola office. ``At one time one of
our fellows called in and said it was about a mile long.''
   The fire was 60 percent contained by fire breaks Sunday evening
after burning an estimated 350 acres, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Dianne Reimers. Winds were expected to kick up again
Monday, but officials did not expect the fire to get much larger,
Ms. Reimers said.
   About 140 firefighters were working to contain the blaze, which
they hoped to have under control by Monday afternoon, she said.
   No one had been evacuated, she said.
   Earlier Sunday, when the Forest Service measured winds at 40 mph
and gusts at 50-60 mph, Hawthorne said about a dozen homes along
Sheridan Lake Road southwest of Rapid City were being monitored.
   Temperatures reached 80 degrees around noon in the Rapid City
area Sunday before a cold front came through and dropped readings
to 50 degrees by 3 p.m.
   The fire-danger index for all of South Dakota was rated
``extreme'' Sunday because of high temperatures, winds and low
relative humidity readings, the National Weather Service said.

<HEAD>Controversy Among Christians and Jews Over Passion Plays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Americans seeking a
profound religious experience will flock this year to elaborately
mounted passion plays, an art form that has been a source of
centuries of suffering for Jews.
   The plays in places such as Eureka Springs, Ark., and Spearfish,
S.D., evoke controversy among Christians and Jews about whether
they promote one of history's cruelest anti-Semitic stereotypes:
that Jews bear a collective guilt for all time for Jesus' death.
   The passion play, portraying Christ's death and resurrection,
dates to the 13th century. The famous passion play in the Bavarian
village of Oberammergau began in the 17th century as collective
devotion for surviving the bubonic plague.
   In the post-Holocaust era, many Jewish and Christian leaders are
questioning the effect of passion plays that retain some of their
medieval origins by portraying Jewish antagonists of Jesus as
``degenerate, loathsome, almost subhuman creatures,'' according to
an American Jewish Committee study.
   ``I think we are in a transition period in terms of
understanding the impact of the Christian Gospel on Jews and
Judaism,'' said the Rev. Vincent A. Heier of St. Louis, a Roman
Catholic priest who is vice president of the National Association
of Diocesan Ecumenical Officers.
   ``One of the problematic areas is passion plays.''
   Passion plays range from lavish professional productions to
small church-organized affairs at carnivals. The Institute for
Outdoor Drama at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
lists nine major U.S. passion plays.
   More than 200,000 Americans are expected to flock to the 1990
Oberammergau Passion Play, which is held every ten years in the
West German town. Officials at the Great Passion Play in Eureka
Springs expect 300,000 people to see their annual production in its
23rd season.
   Play organizers in Oberammergau, partly in response to concerns
raised by American Jewish leaders and some Catholic scholars,
decided to make changes in this year's production such as dropping
the horns from Jewish high priests and protraying Judas as a
confused rather than a coldly mercenary figure.
   But those who have raised similar concerns report mixed success.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a
``really terrific'' set of guidelines for local parishes to be
responsive to issues of anti-Semitism in passion plays, according
to Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director
of the American Jewish Committee.
   One play that the committee said has shown vast improvement is
the Holy Family Passion Play in Union City, N.J.
   Others, such as the non-denominational productions in Arkansas
and South Dakota, have been resistant to change, according to some
observers.
   ``Part of it is we are really out of touch, both Christians and
Jews ... with the sensitivities of the other,'' said the Rev. John
Kelley, who took part in discussions on the Oberammergau production
for the National Secretariat of Jewish-Catholic Relations of the
U.S. Catholic Conference.
   He said a fairly common reaction among Jews is that all passion
plays should be banned, while the first reaction of many Christians
is highly defensive, saying there is nothing in the Scripture that
could be offensive to anyone.
   The Great Passion Play in Eureka Springs, which runs April 27 to
Oct. 27 this year, is the largest, and some say most problematic,
of the U.S. productions.
   Marvin Peterson, executive vice president of the Elna M. Smith
Foundation, which manages the production, said anti-Semitism was
not at issue because the production sticks as close as possible to
biblical accounts.
   Others say the production is historically inaccurate and jarring
in what a 1984 American Jewish Committee study called its
``malevolence'' toward Jews.
   Roslyn Borg, area director of the St. Louis chapter of the
American Jewish Committee, said the production isolates Jesus and
his followers from Judaism, costumes Jesus in white and his Jewish
antagonists in black and portrays Pontius Pilate as a somewhat
compassionate ruler who was easily influenced by the Jews.
   Critics contend other popular passion plays, such as the Black
Hills Passion Play presented in South Dakota and in Lake Wales,
Fla., are filled with distortions.
   Despite such concerns, a resurgence in religious interest in the
nation has increased the popularity of passion plays, Kelley said.
   ``If anything, the number of them seems to be growing,'' he
said. ``As people have a sense of need of religious experience, we
are going to be using this art form more, rather than less.''

<HEAD>Snow, Ice and Winds Keep Midwest Frozen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Midwest was socked by a winter storm Monday, with up to a
foot of snow burying parts of South Dakota and wind chill
temperatures plunging to 45 degrees below zero.
   Much of the East Coast and the South basked in sunshine.
   The large winter storm brought widespread ice and snow from
Indiana to Montana, making driving conditions very hazardous.
Portions of Interstate 90 in southern Minnesota were closed because
of poor conditions.
   A number of car accidents was reported in southern and central
Minnesota and in northeast Indiana.
   In Illinois, up to 8 inches of snow blanketed Rockford, and the
western suburbs of Chicago had 7 inches.
   Temperatures were bitterly cold from Minnesota across the Dakotas
to Wyoming and Montana. Wind chill temperatures dropped to around 45
below zero at Jamestown, N.D., Livingston, Mont., Douglas, Wyo., and
Rapid City, S.D.
   Winter storm warnings for heavy snow were in effect for Minnesota
and most of the Dakotas. Snowfall ranged from 6 to 12 inches with
over a foot in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
   Winds were gusty as well. Winds whipped to 46 mph at Russell,
Kan., and to 69 mph at Guadalupe Pass, in western Texas.
   The cold air was to spill into the Southwest on Tuesday morning.
A frost warning was in effect for inland valleys of Southern
California and a freeze warning was issued for the deserts of
southwestern Arizona.
   But sunshine prevailed across most of the East Coast and Gulf
Coast states. Afternoon temperatures ranged from the teens and 20s
over northern New England to 60s and 70s across the Gulf Coast
states. Readings were in the 70s over much of Texas and southern
Louisiana, and the 80s over southern Texas and southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees below zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 84 degrees at Harlingen
Texas and Fort Myers, Fla.
   The nation's low Monday morning was 21 degrees below zero at
Warroad, Minn.
   Tuesday's forecast called for snow from northern Michigan across
the upper Mississippi Valley and central Plains to western portions
of the southern Plains; sleet and freezing rain from central and
northeast Oklahoma, and over portions of New York and Pennsylvania;
snow through parts of New England; showers and thunderstorms from
the lower Great Lakes across the Ohio and lower Tennessee valleys
and the middle and lower Mississippi Valley to the southeast half of
Texas; rain along the northern Pacific coast with snow inland over
the northern Plateau region; and windy over the central and southern
Plains.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits and teens
from Minnesota through the northern and central high Plains to the
northern Rockies; in the 50s and 60s through the middle and south
Atlantic coast states, the central and southern Appalachians, the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys, much of Arkansas, central Texas, the
desert Southwest and much of California; into the 70s in the central
Gulf Coast region; the 70s and 80s along coastal Texas and most of
Florida; and in the 20s, 30s and 40s around the rest of the nation.

   Former President Gerald R. Ford's
boyhood home that has stood empty for nearly 20 years will be sold
because efforts failed to turn it into a museum.
   ``It's almost a lost cause,'' said Steele Taylor, chairman of
the Grand Rapids Arts and Museum Commission. ``We can't get anybody
interested in fixing it up.''
   The federal Veterans Administration acquired the four-bedroom
house in 1972 when the owner defaulted. Three years later, after
Ford became president, the VA donated it to the city.
   The commission had trouble raising the estimated $51,000 to
renovate the home into a museum because Ford lived in at least
eight homes in Grand Rapids, said Jim Kratsas, curator of the
Gerald R. Ford Museum.
   City records show Ford lived in the white two-story house from
1923 to 1930, from the time he was 10 years old through his junior
year at the Grand Rapids South High School.
   In a 1989 letter to museum director Timothy Chester, Ford wrote:
``I have no objection to _ in fact, I endorse the sale.''
   Museum officials have asked the city's Historic Preservation
Commission to designate the house as a historic landmark to protect
it from demolition.
   Helena Jones, 86, who has lived next door to the Ford house for
20 years, said sentimentality aside, she hopes the house gets sold.
   ``He wasn't president that long,'' Jones said. ``We've got
enough things named after Ford.''

   Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite says he
has something in common with every ``red-blooded human being'' _ a
fascination with dinosaurs.
   Cronkite was doing his part last week to publicize the great
beasts of the past, spending time in Montana to film a documentary
series on dinosaurs.
   ``It's a fascinating project,'' he said Friday as an
international crew filmed a segment northwest of Great Falls, Mont.
``It's something that I think will make an impact in America.''
   The four-hour series produced by Canadian, British and German
television will be shown in the United States on the Arts and
Entertainment cable channel about a year from now.
   Cronkite, 73, spoke with owners of the Bynum Rock Shop, who
found the bones of baby dinosaurs that led to discovery of a key
fossil site. The crew also has filmed a fossil dig near Circle,
Mont., where the most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex was
discovered two years ago.

   Lou Diamond Phillips' latest role is causing
controversy among Navajos, but South Dakota Sioux are honoring the
multiracial actor for his portrayals of American Indians.
   The Sioux have given Phillips, 28, star of the 1987 film ``La
Bamba,'' the honorary name ``Starkeeper,'' publicist Eddie Michaels
said Friday.
   The tribe will officially confer the name on Phillips at a
ceremony later this year in the Black Hills of South Dakota,
Michaels said.
   The watchdog group the American Indian Registry for the
Performing Arts has challenged the casting of Phillips as a Navajo
policeman in a film based on author Tony Hillerman's novel ``The
Dark Wind.''
   Phillips, who played a Mexican-Indian in ``Young Guns'' and
``Young Guns II,'' has said he is part Cherokee, Filipino,
Scottish-Irish, Hawaiian and Hispanic.
   Bonnie Paradise, director of the American Indian Registry, said
last week that Phillips had not provided documentation of his
lineage.

<HEAD>Storm Spreads Heavy Snow Over North-Central States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wintry storm marching across the continent hit the northern
Plains with up to 18 inches of snow Monday, and high wind, poor
visibility and icy roads combined to close schools.
   By afternoon, snow fell over much of the northern Plains region
and the upper Mississippi Valley, while rain extended from eastern
Nebraska into the upper Great Lakes region and northern sections of
the lower Ohio Valley.
   The storm had produced more than 3 feet of snow in California's
Sierra Nevada range on Saturday, and on Sunday dumped 10 to 20
inches of snow at many ski resorts in Colorado.
   Western South Dakota got the heaviest snow Monday with 18 inches
at Spearfish and Galena, both in the Black Hills.
   Northerly wind blowing at 20 to 50 mph in South Dakota reduced
visibility to near zero in blowing snow, and produced wind chill
readings calculated as low as 30 degrees below zero.
   Visibility was zero to one-fourth mile in parts of the northwest
and southwest corners of the state. Roads were snowpacked and
slippery throughout the northwest with light to heavy drifting in
many areas.
   Dozens of schools were closed across parts of South Dakota and
southeastern North Dakota.
   Cass County, N.D., Sheriff Donald Rudnick said it appeared most
people heeded warnings about dangerous travel conditions.
   ``That's one good thing, we haven't had a lot of stalled cars
because it looks like most people weren't out in it,'' Rudnick said.
   In Richland County, N.D., dispatcher Lori Kubitz reported a
number of vehicles were blown off icy roads. ``The wind is blowing
so hard that the plow trucks can't even spread any sand on the
roads,'' she said.
   Strong northerly wind, gusting to 50 mph, ushered cold arctic
air across the Plains, and sharply reduced visibility in blowing
dust across parts of Kansas, the National Weather Service said.
   Strong southerly wind ahead of an approaching cold front helping
temperatures in the middle Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio
Valley warm into the 50s and 60s, with some readings above 70
degrees.
   Peoria, Ill., hit a record 71; St. Louis, Mo., had a record 72;
and Springfield, Ill., had a record 72.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 8 degrees above zero at
McCall, Idaho.

   Casimir Ziolkowski steps from his battered old Blazer to where he is working on a broad shelf near the crest of Thunderhead Mountain. 
To some this place would simply be a mammoth chunk of scarred granite, but Mr. Ziolkowski sees something far different as he walks amid the scattered rock and heavy equipment. 

   Using his work-hardened hands and soft-spoken voice, Mr. Ziolkowski describes a gigantic figure of a bare-chested Indian on horseback that rests within the mountain. 
He says it was there before he was born 34 years ago and that it may still remain uncovered when he dies. 
Yet pulling the image of a long-dead Sioux from the rock is the driving force in his life. 

   To some, the idea of undertaking a project that transcends generations and pays but a fraction of what one's skills could otherwise earn might seem hard to comprehend. 
Not so for Mr. Ziolkowski, nor for any of his five siblings who join him in a common task. 
Theirs is a story of dedication, family love and a father unlike any other. 

   Mr. Ziolkowski's father, Korczak, was called many things in his lifetime, from "crazy fool" to a "modern-day Michelangelo," but it's a safe bet he was never called average. 
Orphaned in Boston at the age of one, Korczak grew up abused and overworked, and though he never had a lesson, he took to sculpting in an almost magical way. 

   His portrait of the Polish pianist-statesman Paderewski was an award-winning, overwhelming success at the 1939 New York World's Fair. 
That work, as well as others -- including the Noah Webster statue in West Hartford, Conn., quickly transformed the young sculptor into one of the most recognized artists in New England. 
At the time it seemed as if his was a career with no boundaries. 

   Then in 1947 the World War II veteran headed to the wilderness of the Black Hills of South Dakota to take on a challenge unlike any the world had ever seen. 
Having watched the U.S. government carve a tribute to four of its greatest leaders into the side of a mountain in his people's sacred Black Hills, Sioux Chief Henry Standing Bear wrote to Korczak asking him to carve an Indian memorial. 
He told Korczak, "My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man had great heroes, too." 

   Korczak's plans called for the single largest piece of art in the world. 
The image of the famous chief Crazy Horse, long hair blowing in the wind and an outstretched arm pointing out over the head of a hard-charging horse, would be 563 feet high and 641 feet long. 
For comparison, that's taller than the Washington Monument, and the four stoic faces of Mt. Rushmore all would easily fit within the carved head of Crazy Horse. 
The carving would also be done in the round, a three-dimensional undertaking that could be seen from all directions. 

   Korczak started with just $174, and the work went slowly. 
The first year was consumed with building a home amid the ponderosa pines. 
The next saw him erect a 721-step staircase that served as his only route from bottom to mountain top for more than a decade. 
The need to repair antiquated equipment often had him scaling the seemingly endless flight of steps several times a day. 
And there was more standing in the way of Korczak's dream than just hard physical labor. 

   "He really started with nothing," says Mr. Ziolkowski of his father. 
"He not only did the work, but he also struggled for recognition and support. 
He felt strongly that the government should not pay for the project. 
Twice he turned down chances at millions of dollars in federal aid while he struggled along with private contributions and his own money. 

   Korczak dedicated the remainder of his life to shaping the monument as a tribute to the glory and tragedy of the American Indian. 
His final words to his family from his deathbed in 1982 were, "You must work on the mountain, but you must do it slowly -- so you do it right." 

   There were many who thought that the dream would die with the dreamer, but it continues on. 
Rather than having faded, it's stronger than ever. 

   Nearly a mile from where Mr. Ziolkowski and others work on the mountain, Ruth Ziolkowski, the late artist's widow, drinks from a coffee cup marked "Grandma" while she completes the chore of the moment -- planning a dinner for 30 guests. 

   A silver-haired woman with the kind of beauty and spirit that time can't erode, Mrs. Ziolkowski oversees the entire operation, monitoring the progress of the mountain as well as the Visitor Center and nearby Indian Museum of North America. 
It's a job almost as big as the mountain itself, but Mrs. Ziolkowski admits that she has plenty of help. 

   As for the construction, realizing his own mortality Korczak left three volumes of detailed directions for finishing the monument. 
"Nine of our ten children are still in the area and with one exception all are involved," said Mrs. Ziolkowski. 
"Six of them are here on a daily basis. 
We never forced them to stay; all have had a chance to see the other side of the fence yet most have come back." 

   "Growing up here and watching {Korczak} work on the mountain with such sincerity really wore on us," said Mr. Ziolkowski as he tried to explain his reason for staying. 
"That plus all of the obstacles. 
Oftentimes we weren't too popular with others. 
First, they thought we were just plain crazy. 
Second, we were Polish, and third, they didn't like it that we were doing something for the Indians that some hated. 
But rather than drive us away, that bonded us together as a family. . . . 
We're close -- very, very close." 

   But the tide seems to have changed as the sculpture enters its fifth decade this summer. 
More than eight million tons of rock have been removed from the mountain, and when compared with a 1/34-scale replica of the finished project, the mountain is showing marked progress. 

   There still are problems; weather often limits the workers to just five months a year, and despite the contributions of a million visitors a year and a strong grassroots support system, money is always needed. 

   Yet the most asked question is no longer if but when the project will see the fulfillment of the great sculptor's dream. 
"The important thing isn't when it's finished, but rather that it is finished someday," says Casimir Ziolkowski. 
"Our father always said that if the mountain wasn't finished his whole life would have been wasted. 
I guess we kind of feel the same way. 
At first I thought I was doing it for him but now I know I'm doing it for me and my children as well. 
Now I know why he wanted his children and grandchildren to get involved."

   About 40 mustangs have found a new home
at a 4,300-acre wild horse sanctuary on the rugged South Dakota
range.
   ``We're going to do our best to make this a success for years to
come,'' said Bob Burford, director of the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, which sponsored the sanctuary and its dedication
Wednesday.
   The horses joined about 150 others already running free on the
sanctuary in an isolated southern Black Hills canyon.
   The mustangs were rounded up by the federal government from
public lands across the southwestern United States. The wild horses
in some areas were in danger of starving to death because natural
food sources no longer existed.
   The horses also were a nuisance to private landowners. Some have
been found slaughtered in Nevada.
   Nevada Gov. Dick Bryan earlier this week pledged full state
support to help federal officials in their investigation of the
rifle killings of nearly 300 wild horses.
   All the shootings occurred in remote central Nevada within a
40-mile stretch north of Austin, an isolated Nevada town on U.S.
50. Federal investigators said the horses died over a six-month
period.
   But at the sanctuary in South Dakota, state officials said they
think the wild horses will be a popular tourist attraction,
particularly during the state's centennial next year when attention
is focused on South Dakota's frontier and western heritage.
   The driving force behind the sanctuary was Dayton Hyde, a
lifelong rancher and the founder of the Institute of Range and the
American Mustang.
   ``They're having fun,'' Hyde said. ``They spend a lot of their
time just running. They take off like school children.''
   Hyde said he hopes to develop a wild horse museum at the
sanctuary, featuring films about horses and a history of the horse
in the West's development.
   ``I want a front porch from which you can see the horse herd
along the Cheyenne River,'' he said. ``This is some of the most
beautiful country in the West. Not enough people get to see it.''
