ILLINI OFFENSE STALLS, BUT DEFENSE STIFFENS TO KEY 21-3 VICTORY

<P>
Fifth-ranked Illinois remained unbeaten in Big Ten play, defeating Wisconsin, 
21-3, Saturday at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Coach John Mackovic credited his team's defense, which had to play 
well because the offense was not productive. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively we had way too many turnovers, but fortunately our defense did 
what was needed," said Mackovic, whose team is 6-1 overall and 4-0 in the Big 
Ten. "They kept the pressure on Wisconsin's quarterbacks, which reduced their 
effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois fumbled five times and lost three, but the Illini defense also 
recovered four fumbles, held the Badgers (1-6, 0-4) to 15 yards rushing, and 
kept the pressure on Wisconsin quarterbacks Tony Lowery and Sean Wilson, who 
were sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery left the game in the third quarter with a bruised back. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jason Verduzco passed for two touchdowns and Wagner Lester ran for 
a third to lead the Illini offense. 
</P>
<P>
Lester, who played high school football in Racine, Wis., said the Fighting 
Illini were not looking ahead to next Saturday's showdown against Iowa, which 
holds a share of the Big Ten lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say we took Wisconsin lightly," Lester said. "We just didn't 
prepare for the physical game it turned out to be. They played real tough and 
came out and got right after us." 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez said Illinois' defense was as tough as any the 
Badgers have faced this season. "They are confident and physical and that's how 
you win football games -- playing like that," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
Verduzco threw a six-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Shawn Wax to open the 
scoring on the first play of the second quarter. The Illini got the ball back 
three plays later when Lowery fumbled on the Badger 23 and Erik Foggey 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Lester ran in from six yards out to give the Illini a 
two-touchdown advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin scored 26 seconds before the end of the first half on a 43-yard field 
goal by Rich Thompson. The field goal was set up by Scott Nelson's interception 
and return to the Illini 33. 
</P>
<P>
With a stiff wind and chilly temperatures affecting both teams, Illinois 
fumbled three times in the third quarter and the Badgers twice. Thompson also 
missed a 52-yard attempt in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois got its final touchdown on Verduzco's seven-yard touchdown pass to 
Elbert Turner with 4:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois is now 9-1-1 in its last 11 meetings with Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Iowa 56, Northwestern 14 -- Hawkeye tailbacks Nick Bell and Tony Stewart 
played only half the game at Iowa City, but Wildcat Coach Francis Peay saw 
about as much as he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I think about the pair of Tony Stewart and Nick Bell? Thank God we 
play Iowa only once a year," Peay said. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Rodgers threw for two first-half touchdowns and Bell scored three times 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (6-1, 4-0) plays at Illinois next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern (2-5, 1-3) dropped its 17th consecutive game to the Hawkeyes. The 
Wildcats haven't won at Iowa City since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes put the game away early by scoring touchdowns on five of their 
first six possessions, including 29 points in the second quarter. Coming into 
the game, Iowa had outscored its opponents 79-37 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our backs, I thought, both Stewart and Bell ran extremely hard, breaking 
tackles, twisting and turning," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said. "They've done that 
in several ball games. I try to rotate them to keep them fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Bell gained 136 yards in 16 first-half carries, and scored the game's first 
touchdown on a six-yard run. He also scored on runs of 16 and 26 yards in the 
second quarter to help Iowa build a 35-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who rotates with Bell at tailback, carried 15 times for 122 yards 
before coming out early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Michigan 45, Indiana 19 -- Wolverine quarterback Elvis Grbac completed 
14 of 18 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns as the Big Ten's top offense 
manhandled the conference's leading defense at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan safety Tripp Welborne set up scores with a 60-yard punt return and a 
pass interception. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Vaughn, the nation's rushing leader, gained 91 yards -- including a 47-yard 
touchdown run -- despite sitting out much of the game with a sore ankle. 
Vaughn's season rushing total is 1,011 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines improved to 4-3 overall and 2-2 in the Big Ten. The Hoosiers are 
4-2-1 and 1-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana got a touchdown late in the second quarter on an eight-yard pass from 
Chris Dyer to Rob Turner, who sprained his right ankle on the play, and on runs 
of one yard by Cal Miller and 16 yards by Vaughn Dunbar in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 55, Purdue 33 -- Tailback Tico Duckett rushed for 210 yards in 
34 carries and scored four touchdowns as the Spartans (3-3-1, 2-2) dominated 
the injury-riddled Boilermakers (1-6, 0-4) at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State had 34 first downs and 423 yards rushing, while Purdue was held 
to six first downs and six yards rushing. But Purdue did manage 253 yards 
passing, most of it coming late. 
</P>
<P>
Duckett scored on runs of two, 14, 15 and three yards. Hyland Hickson had 103 
yards in 16 carries, including touchdown runs of one and six yards. Sebeatian 
Small scored on a one-yard run and John Langeloh kicked field goals of 24 and 
33 yards for Michigan State.

STANFORD 80, WISCONSIN 72
Highlight: Adam Keefe scored 33 points, leading the Cardinal into the NIT's
third round.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And now, Keefe and his Cardinal teammates have one more stop on the road to
New York for the NIT final four. Stanford (17-13) will travel to Carbondale,
Ill., to face Southern Illinois (18-13) in a third-round game Thursday at 5:30
p.m. PST.;    Which means more folks figure to get to know Keefe. The 6-foot-9
junior center's polished inside game spoke volumes from the start as he scored
15 of his career-high 33 points in a 26-9 game-opening start that put
Wisconsin (15-15) at a disadvantage it couldn't overcome.;    "Out West,
basketball's not as big as it is in the East and Midwest," Keefe said. "All I
hear about out there are Perry Carter and Eric Anderson," he said, referring
to Wisconsin's Big Ten opponents from Ohio State and Indiana, respectively.;  
 But Keefe, who hit 14 of 21 shots and grabbed 14 rebounds, left them talking
about him after he held a get-to-know-you session with the Badgers.;    "I've
seen guys with more athletic ability, but not somebody with that ability and
the smarts he has," said Wisconsin forward John Ellenson, who opened against
Keefe defensively but gave way 5 1/2 minutes into the game.;    The Badgers
turned the ball over on seven of their first 10 possessions with little help
from Stanford's man-to-man defense.;    With Keefe dominating the offensive
end, Stanford cruised to its big lead in the game's first 7 minutes, 26
seconds as Keefe's size and strength rendered Wisconsin's man-to-man defense
helpless.;    It was too much for Wisconsin. With Willie Simms, who scored a
team-high 14 points, and Tim Locum scoring six points apiece, the Badgers
rallied. But Keefe's 21-point, 10-of-12 first half was enough to keep the
Cardinal in charge at halftime, 39-30, despite the absence of Andrew Vlahov
for all by nine minutes of the first half because of foul trouble.;    "I was
surprised with Andrew on the bench how well we did," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said of his 6-7 senior forward, in his second game back from an
ankle injury that sidelined him for 11 games.;    Just as surprised, in fact,
as Wisconsin Coach Steve Yoder was that his team duplicated its slow
first-half start after intermission.;    Wisconsin turnovers led to
three-point plays by Deshon Wingate and Keefe that made it 50-32 with 15:38
left.;    The Badgers' desperation full-court pressure defense in the final
4:41 made a slight dent. Stanford made 14 of 19 free throws in the final 4:25
to seal the victory. Kenny Ammann scored 14 points for the Cardinal, Wingate
had 11 and Marcus Lollie 10.;    "I don't know what it was," Yoder said,
rebutting the suggestion that the sloppy Wisconsin play was caused by nerves.
"Stanford was just the best team tonight.";    And Keefe was the best of the
best.;  STANFORD (80);            fg-aft-a tp; Vlahov    2-3 1-3   5,;

ILLINOIS, IN FIRST GAME AS NO. 1, LOSES TO MINNESOTA

<P>
After its long climb to the top of the hill, Illinois' fall from grace was 
swift. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Illini, the last undefeated team in Division I, were knocked off 
their perch by Minnesota, 69-62, Thursday night in a Big Ten Conference game at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tribute to our young men and how hard they worked to be No. 1," 
Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. "But (being ranked first) certainly doesn't 
help you win ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (17-1 overall, 4-1 in the Big Ten) was playing its first game since 
rising to the No. 1 spot Monday. In 1952, the last time the Illini were No. 1 
during the regular season, they were beaten by DePaul in their first game after 
reaching the top. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (11-5, 3-3) was effective in its zone defense, especially since 
Illinois lost standout point guard Kendall Gill, third in the Big Ten in 
3-point shooting, with a broken foot in its last game. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat the No. 1 team," Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said. "Sure, they could 
have played better. But I'm very, very proud of my Gophers." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota pulled off its second upset in 12 days, having beaten then-No. 5 Iowa 
on Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Burton had 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Gophers, but it was his 
passing that helped turn the game Minnesota's way. 
</P>
<P>
Burton made remarkable passes on three straight plays during a 13-0 run in the 
first half that gave the Gophers a 25-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so high because I've never played against a No. 1 team in college," 
Burton said. "We were juiced up tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota built its lead to 20 points with 9:56 left and held off a late 
Illinois rally. Kenny Battle scored 5 points in a 10-0 run that got the Illini 
within 61-59 with 5:16 left. Then Burton hit a basket, Lynch added 2 free 
throws and it was over. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 88, Duke 73 -- Brian Howard scored 23 points, and the 
15th-ranked Wolfpack handed the No. 8 Blue Devils their third straight defeat 
in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (13-3, 3-3), mired in a slump after winning its first 13 games, played 
without All-American Danny Ferry, who has been bothered by back spasms all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State (13-2, 4-1) had a 48-38 lead on Chucky Brown's basket with 
15:39 left, but the Blue Devils rallied and surged ahead, 63-61, on Robert 
Brickey's shot with 10:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
But N.C. State turned 3 steals into baskets and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Alaa Abdelnaby scored 24 points, and Brickey added 19, while Brown scored 15 
for the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 78, Wisconsin 70 -- Roy Marble got 24 points and became Iowa's all-time 
leading scorer as the 12th-ranked Hawkeyes downed the Badgers in a Big Ten game 
at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Marble, a 6-foot 6-inch senior, broke the record of 1,768 points set by Greg 
Stokes 4 years ago. Ed Horton added 22 points for Iowa (15-3, 2-2), which 
played its first home game since Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa led by 11 points at halftime and made it 53-40 on B.J. Armstrong's 3-point 
shot. But Wisconsin (15-3, 3-2) scored the next 3 baskets, including a 
3-pointer by Tim Locum, to get within 53-47 with 10:46 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin came within 66-62 with 3:42 left, but Horton scored 3 of Iowa's next 
5 points to finish off the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jones scored 27 points for Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 95, So. Mississippi 76 -- Pervis Ellison scored 26 points, and the 
third-ranked Cardinals trounced the Golden Eagles in a Metro Conference game at 
Hattiesburg, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 43-39 halftime lead, Louisville (14-2, 3-0) broke it open with a 
22-6 surge to open the second half and rolled to its 14th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Bates scored 17 points for Southern Mississippi (6-9, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 69, South Carolina 67 -- George McCloud hit a 3-pointer with 7 
seconds left to give the No. 11 Seminoles a Metro Conference victory over the 
Gamecocks at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina (12-4, 2-2), which took the lead on Terry Dozier's 2 free throws 
with 37 seconds left, couldn't get off a shot after McCloud hit. 
</P>
<P>
Tat Hunter scored 20 points for Florida State (15-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 100, Northwestern 68 -- Perry Carter scored 25 points as the No. 17 
Buckeyes rolled past the Wildcats in a Big Ten game at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Burson added 19 points, and Jerry Francis scored 11 for Ohio State (14-4, 
4-2), which took a 23-4 lead and never was threatened. Northwestern is 8-9 and 
1-6.

MICHIGAN GETS 700TH VICTORY DESPITE PURDUE'S ERIC HUNTER

<P>
Michigan was playing for history Saturday, but Purdue freshman Eric Hunter 
refused to be a mere footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-ranked Michigan became the second school in NCAA history to win 700 
games as Tony Boles scored three touchdowns, one on an 85-yard kickoff return, 
and the Wolverines held off Purdue and Hunter for a 42-27 Big Ten victory at 
Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, a true freshman making his first start, became the first quarterback to 
pass for four touchdowns in a game against the Wolverines. Hunter completed 27 
of 42 passes for 344 yards. Three of his four touchdown passes came in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is the first team in Division I-A history to reach the 700-victory 
plateau. Yale is the all-time NCAA leader with 753 wins. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue rolled up 389 total yards and Michigan 372. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the Wolverines to 7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Big Ten, 
setting up a showdown next week when they visit Illinois. Purdue dropped to 1-7 
and 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue played without Abe Hoskins, a second-string receiver from Omaha, Neb., 
who was suspended because of an arrest Friday on battery charges after an 
altercation with his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 31, Iowa 7 -- Wagner Lester scored two touchdowns and quarterback Jeff 
George completed 28 of 44 passes for 302 yards and a touchdown to lead the No. 
8 Illini in a Big Ten game at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, 7-1 overall, goes into its showdown against Michigan next Saturday 
with a 5-0 conference record. Iowa fell to 4-4 and 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Lester scored on a one-yard plunge with 12 seconds left in the first half and 
also on a 26-yard burst around right end with four minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 52, Northwestern 27 -- Jaymes Bryant handled the ball only twice but 
scored both times in helping the Buckeyes beat the Wildcats in a Big Ten game 
at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant scored two of the Buckeyes' three second-quarter touchdowns, running 63 
yards for one and catching a pass on a 46-yard play for the other. He suffered 
a collarbone injury on his touchdown catch with 59 seconds left in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Lee, who rushed for 157 yards in 24 carries, scored three second-half 
touchdowns as Ohio State (6-2 and 4-1) pulled away. The Buckeyes led 45-14 
after three quarters. Northwestern is 0-8 and 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 24, Wisconsin 22 -- Ron Goetz returned an interception 73 yards for a 
touchdown in the fourth quarter to turn back a Badger rally as the Gophers (5-3 
and 3-2) scored a Big Ten victory at Minneapolis. Wisconsin is 2-6 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
With 9:02 left to play, the Badgers, trailing only 17-14, drove to the 
Minnesota 30, but Goetz stepped in front of a swing pass and sprinted down the 
left sideline for the winning score.

Trent Jackson and the Wisconsin Badgers can finally take a winning season off 
their wish list. 
</P>
<P>
They took care of that Saturday by routing fifth-ranked Illinois, 72-52, in a 
Big Ten game at Madison, Wis., to clinch the school's first winning season in 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the list is a tournament bid. That has been even more rare than a 
winning season. The Badgers haven't received a postseason invitation since 
1947.

"It was a big victory for the team," said Jackson, who made five three-pointers 
and 10 of 15 shots to score 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes us one giant step closer to making it to the NCAA tournament, which 
has been our season-long goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers held a 32-18 halftime lead, and cold-shooting Illinois never got 
closer than 12 points in the second half. Jackson's jumper with 13:10 to go 
gave the Badgers a 47-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers are 15-7 overall and 7-6 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (21-4, 8-4) couldn't solve the Badgers' collapsing defense. Averaging 
88 points entering the game, the Illini were held 10 points below their 
previous season low. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Coach Lou Henson said the Badgers, who earlier in the season were 
hoping for a National Invitation Tournament bid, have a chance to earn a 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. bid. In addition to Illinois, their other 
homecourt victims include Michigan and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jones had 17 points for Wisconsin, and Tim Locum, who had four 
three-point baskets, scored 12. The Badgers lost to Illinois by 23 points 
earlier this season, and Saturday's victory was their first in the last 17 
games against the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
"Trent had one of his finest days in a Badger uniform," Coach Steve Yoder said. 
"It's a big game for us, but everybody is talking about the tournament and 
there is no tournament for us if we don't keep winning. If you keep winning, 
you earn that right to go. That's what we have to do. We got our 15th win and 
that's not going to get you there." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 106, Colorado 88 -- Stacey King scored 23 of his 28 points in the 
second half to help the top-ranked Sooners win the Big Eight game at Boulder, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
King scored four points and Mookie Blaylock had seven, helping Oklahoma take a 
24-8 lead, and the Sooners (23-3, 9-1) never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado (7-16, 2-6) cut the lead to 26-16 with 8:37 to go in the half, but 
Oklahoma surged to a 37-21 lead on a 3-point basket by Terrance Mullins with 
5:50 left. The Sooners led, 46-35, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
King helped Oklahoma build its lead in the second half, scoring the basket that 
gave the Sooners their biggest advantage, 101-78, with 2:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 102, Kansas 77 -- Danny Ferry had his jersey retired in pregame ceremonies 
at Durham, N.C., then scored 20 of his 26 points in the first half as the No. 
11 Blue Devils extended their winning streak to five games with an easy victory 
over the Jayhawks, who lost for the seventh consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas shot 55% in the first half, but the Blue Devils forced 15 turnovers, 
shot 62.9% and used an 11-3 run to start the runaway that helped raised their 
record to 19-4. 
</P>
<P>
Duke led, 53-34, at halftime and extended the lead to as much as 27 points 
before Kansas (16-10) scored the game's final basket. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 80, Boston College 69 -- The No. 4 Hoyas limited the Eagles to one 
basket in the final 5 1/2 minutes to easily win the Big East game at Newton, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (20-3, 10-2) also used excellent free throw shooting down the 
stretch, making the front ends of their last eight one-and-one situations. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College (9-13, 1-10) was led by Dana Barros with 23, including five 
three-pointers. Barros' three-point basket with 5:38 left cut the lead to 
63-61. Barros extended his streak of games with at least one three-pointer to 
63. That was the last field goal for the Eagles until Steve Benton's layup with 
51 seconds left, making the score 76-69. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 87, Providence 80 -- Derrick Coleman scored 22 points and led a late 
surge that carried the No. 6 Orangemen to their 20th consecutive victory over 
the Friars in a Big East game at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (22-5 overall, 8-5 in the Big East), has never lost a conference game 
against Providence (17-6, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
Marty Conlon, who scored a career-high 29 points for Providence, made two free 
throws to tie it, 72-72. But Coleman, playing the last seven minutes with four 
fouls, scored five points as Syracuse took a 79-74 lead with 4:42 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 89, Florida State 78 -- Elliot Perry scored 24 points and Ernest 
Smith added 22 to lead the Tigers to their second victory over the No. 7 
Seminoles in a Metro Conference game at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second disappointing defeat for the Seminoles (19-4, 7-3) in three 
days. They lost to Louisville, 78-77, in overtime Thursday night. The Tigers 
beat them, 99-82, in Tallahassee Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State (19-8, 6-3) maintained a fast pace and held the lead through most 
of the game. The Tigers twice took leads of 22 points in the second period, the 
last at 71-49 with 8:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsurgh 82, Seton Hall 76 -- The Panthers continued their mastery over ranked 
teams at home as Brian Shorter scored 26 points and Jason Matthews had 22 to 
lead Pitt to the Big East victory over the No. 14 Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers, who upset the then-No. 9 Pirates, 82-79, Jan. 28, overcame Ramon 
Ramos' 25 points for their fifth victory over a Top 20 team this season. Pitt 
earlier beat Oklahoma, Syracuse, Seton Hall and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews made six consecutive free throws down the stretch as the Panthers 
(14-10, 7-6) made 12 in a row in the final 2:14 of play until Rod Brookin 
missed a free throw with 16 seconds left. Pitt made 18 of 20 second-half free 
throws and 26 of 29 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt, which squandered an early nine-point lead when Seton Hall (21-5, 8-5) 
scored 15 consecutive points, took the lead for good when Shorter's layup with 
12:54 to play started the Panthers on a 7-0 run that made it 56-50. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 99, Minnesota 61 -- Matt Bullard scored 20 points and Roy Marble added 19 
at Iowa City, Iowa, to help the No. 15 Hawkeyes hand the Gophers their 12th 
consecutive Big Ten road defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (19-6, 7-5) also avenged an 80-78 loss to Minnesota (14-8, 6-6) earlier 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard, a 6-foot-10 transfer from Colorado, had his finest game since a knee 
injury put him out of the lineup seven games into the season. Playing with a 
brace on his left knee, he scored 14 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa led, 45-33, at halftime and outscored Minnesota, 16-6, at the start of the 
second half to take a 61-39 lead with 13:19 to play, and Minnesota never came 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern 70, Ohio State 69 -- Brian Schwabe made a free throw with 4 
seconds left to give the Wildcats the Big Ten upset over the No. 16 Buckeyes at 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State was playing its first game without leading scorer Jay Burson, whose 
college career ended with a neck injury suffered Monday night against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Lambiotte scored 23 points for Northwestern (9-14, 2-11), which overcame 
a 16-point deficit in the final eight minutes. Perry Carter scored 25 points 
for Ohio State (17-8, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 71, Georgia Tech 69 -- Rodney Monroe's two free throws 
with 14 seconds left gave the No. 19 Wolfpack the Atlantic Coast Conference 
victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The game's start was delayed about 15 minutes because snow and ice delayed 
North Carolina State's departure from Raleigh. The Wolfpack had only a 
10-minute warmup before the delayed tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the Wolfpack (17-5 overall), in first place in the ACC at 8-2. 
The Yellow Jackets (17-8, 6-4) played without starting forward Tom Hammonds, 
who has a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech tied the score, 69-69, with seven consecutive points, capped by 
Brian Oliver's two free throws with a minute left. Oliver had a chance to tie 
the score again with one second left, but missed both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt 108, Louisiana State 74 -- Barry Goheen scored 23 points and Barry 
Booker added 21 as the Commodores handed the No. 20 Tigers their worst loss of 
the season in the Southeastern Conference game at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (16-10, 10-4) led by five points at halftime and then pulled away 
behind Goheen's 17 points in the second half. LSU (18-7, 10-4) was led by 
freshman Chris Jackson, who scored 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodores opened the second half with a 23-11 run, 10 by Goheen, for a 
64-47 lead. Jackson tried to rally LSU with 13 points in the next 4 1/2 minutes 
to cut the margin to 72-65. But he was shut out in the final 9:16, and 
Vanderbilt broke the game open with a 17-0 run that made it 98-70 with 2:39 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 71, Kentucky 67 -- Michael Ansley scored 24 points and had 14 rebounds 
at Lexington, Ky., to help the Crimson Tide hand the Wildcats their fifth 
straight defeat in the SEC game at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first time Kentucky (11-15, 6-8) has lost five in a row since 1924-25, 
when the Wildcats opened the season with five defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Horry gave Alabama (17-6, 9-5) the lead for good, 64-62, on a 12-footer 
with 2:53 left. Kentucky's Reggie Hanson made a free throw, but Ansley made a 
jumper and David Benoit a dunk to give the Tide a 68-63 lead with 1:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
Florida 99, Tennessee 81 -- Dwayne Schintzius made 12 of 13 shots and finished 
with 27 points at Gainesville, Fla., to lead the Gators to their eighth 
straight SEC win. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston Chatman added 19 points, Renaldo Garcia had 17 and Clifford Lett 
scored 16 as the Gators (16-10, 10-4) won for the eighth time in nine games 
since losing to Tennessee Jan. 18 at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius, who made seven of eight shots in the first half and all five 
attempts after halftime, also had 11 rebounds. Florida's defense keyed a rally 
from a 10-point first-half deficit and held Dyron Nix, the SEC's third-leading 
scorer with a 23-point average, to eight points on four of 15 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Swearengen scored 20 points for Tennessee (15-8, 8-6).

BIG TEN ROUNDUP;

<P>
ILLINOIS' GRIFFITH RUNS FOR 263 YARDS AND TWO SCORES IN 28-23 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Griffith ran for a school-record 263 yards and scored two touchdowns to 
lead Illinois to a 28-23 Big Ten victory over Northwestern Saturday at 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith, who carried 37 times, broke the one-game mark set by Jim Grabowski, 
who gained 237 yards against Wisconsin in 1964. Griffith also set records with 
15 touchdowns this season and 33 in his career, two more than Red Grange, the 
Galloping Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really the story of the Galloping Grif today," Illinois Coach John 
Mackovic said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith scored an NCAA-record eight touchdowns in a 56-21 victory over 
Southern Illinois on Sept. 23. He gained 208 yards in 21 carries in that game. 
</P>
<P>
He needed 207 against Northwestern to finish the regular season with 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates were saying they would get me the 207 yards," Griffith said. "I 
was saying to myself, 'That's a lot of yards.' Basically, I can't do anything 
but thank my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith scored on a pair of two-yard runs for Illinois (8-3, 6-2), which will 
play Clemson in the Hall of Fame Bowl Jan. 1. Northwestern finished 2-9 and 
1-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini rolled to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter on Griffith's first 
touchdown, a three-yard run by Steve Feagin and a 14-yard scoring pass from 
Jason Verduzco to Jeff Finke. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Michigan State 14, Wisconsin 9 -- Hyland Hickson, with 134 yards 
rushing, and Tico Duckett, with 82, were double trouble for the Badgers at East 
Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Hickson ran for two touchdowns, both in the first quarter, and the Spartan 
defense held Wisconsin to 69 rushing yards as Michigan State (7-3-1, 6-2) won 
its fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Hickson finished the regular season with 1,128 yards. That, combined with 
Duckett's 1,376 yards, makes them the first Big Ten duo in 15 years and only 
the third in league history to combine for more than 2,000 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Duckett and Hickson are five yards shy of the Big Ten record of 2,509 yards by 
Ohio State's Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson in 1975. Since the conference 
includes bowl games in its records, the Michigan State runners appear certain 
to break the mark against USC in the John Hancock Bowl on Dec. 31 at El Paso, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin (1-10, 0-8) lost a school-record 13th consecutive conference game. 
The Badgers' last Big Ten victory was over Northwestern, 35-31, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously not crazy about our record, but we have some things we can 
build on," said Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin's first-year coach. "I was very proud 
of the effort that our kids gave today. It would have been easy . . . to come 
out here and go through the motions." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 28, Purdue 14 -- Vaughn Dunbar ran for 105 yards and three touchdowns 
at West Lafayette, Ind., and Mike Dumas set an Indiana school record with a 
99-yard interception return, although he fell a yard short of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (6-4-1, 3-4-1) intercepted four passes and recovered three fumbles by 
Purdue's Ernest Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers secured a berth in the Peach Bowl Dec. 29 at Atlanta, where they 
will meet a Southeastern Conference opponent, probably the loser of next 
Saturday's Alabama-Auburn game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's interceptions against Purdue included one returned 21 yards for a 
touchdown by Mark Hagen, one returned 25 yards by Damon Watts that set up 
Dunbar's first touchdown and the one by Dumas that set up Dunbar's final 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana, winning the annual season-ending battle for the Old Oaken Bucket, took 
a 21-0 halftime lead before Purdue's Eric Hunter passed 41 yards for a 
touchdown to Jermaine Ross early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (2-9, 1-7) reached the Indiana 24 late in the quarter, but a 
pass intended for Jimmy Young was intercepted by Dumas at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas returned to the Purdue one before he was knocked out of bounds by Hunter. 
Three plays later, after a penalty for illegal motion, Dunbar ran three yards 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The return by Dumas broke the Indiana record of 98 yards, set by Tim Wilbur 
against Michigan State in 1978.

PURDUE MANHANDLES NO. 25 INDIANA, 72-49 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Indiana Coach Bob Knight watched some good defensive basketball Monday night, 
but most of it was played by Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play badly defensively," said Knight after the ninth-ranked 
Boilermakers beat the No. 25 Hoosiers, 72-49, at West Lafayette, Ind., to 
maintain sole possession of the Big Ten Conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
"But, if we played decent defensively, they played extremely well. Their 
defense dominated our offense the vast majority of the time," said Knight, 
whose team shoot only 39%. 
</P>
<P>
Said Purdue Coach Gene Keady: "It's not very often you get to play a big rival 
and play that well on defense. I thought that was the best defense we've played 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
It was Purdue's biggest margin of victory over its archrival since a 120-76 
victory in 1969. The outcome might have been more one-sided if the 
Boilermakers, who were led by Stephen Scheffler's 18 points, had not cleared 
their bench with five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (19-4, 11-2 in the conference) opened a one-game lead over Michigan 
State as it swept the Hoosiers (16-7, 6-7) for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Connecticut 75, Providence 72 -- The legend of Nadav Henefeld, already 
sizable in Connecticut, grew again when the former Israeli soldier made a 
three-point shot at the buzzer in overtime to lead the Huskies in a Big 
Conference game at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld, a 6-foot-7, 21-year-old freshman, had four steals and a team-leading 
nine rebounds, but shot poorly most of the game, finishing with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
But with two seconds left on the 45-second clock, Tate George found Henefeld at 
the top of the key for an open jump shot that bounced off the rim, touched the 
backboard and dropped through. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Huskies (23-4, 10-3) ahead of Georgetown (9-3) for first 
place in the conference. The Friars dropped to 14-9 and 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin 82, Marquette 65 -- At Madison, Wis., Danny Jones scored 19 points 
and the Badgers got 10 points as a result of five technical fouls called on the 
Warriors in the 96th meeting of the intrastate rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin (13-14) opened the second half with a 17-6 run after leading, 32-29, 
at halftime. Tim Locum added 17 points as Wisconsin beat Marquette (12-11) for 
the fifth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Marquette Coach Kevin O'Neill was ejected after picking up his second technical 
with 15 seconds left. He paused to shake hands of players and coaches on the 
Wisconsin bench as he left the court. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State 89, Fresno State 83 -- Darrel White scored a career-high 25 points 
and Kendall Youngblood added 20 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Aggies in a 
Big West Conference game at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (14-11, 8-6) jumped to a 13-8 lead with 15:16 left in the half and 
never trailed. Fresno State is 9-14 and 4-10.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WITH TAYLOR BACK AT HELM, MICHIGAN DEFEATS IOWA, 26-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Taylor, playing for the first time since the season opener, passed for 
two touchdowns and ran for another to lead No. 5 Michigan to a 26-12 Big Ten 
victory over Iowa Saturday at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Elvis Grbac led Michigan to four victories while Taylor 
was recovering from a back injury suffered in a Sept. 18 loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor started Saturday and made his presence felt, completing 11 of 15 
passes for 179 yards and keeping the Hawkeyes off balance with his quickness 
and running ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did all right," said Taylor, who played the entire game. "I took 
what the defense gave me. Except for one bad pass and one bad read, I think I 
was able to take what they gave me and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who returned to practice two weeks ago, helped Michigan to its first 
victory at Iowa since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines improved to 5-1 overall and remained tied with Illinois for 
first place in the Big Ten at 3-0. Iowa is 3-3 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler said last week that Taylor probably would play 
Saturday, although it was thought that Grbac would start. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know whether Taylor would be ready or not," Schembechler said. 
"You've got to understand that Taylor had very little preseason practice. He 
played the Notre Dame game and was rusty and turned the ball over twice and had 
a bad arm, then got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at the end of the second week (of practice) if he had sufficiently 
developed, we wanted to play him. Frankly, I told him he'd start this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said Taylor played well, but he would have felt comfortable with 
Grbac playing. 
</P>
<P>
"But the experience for Michael Taylor will pay off in the long run," he said, 
"if we can get him back to where he was before he got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 9-6, at halftime, Michigan got touchdowns 3:24 apart in the third 
quarter. Taylor scored on a two-yard, fourth-down run with 5:49 left in the 
quarter to cap a 10-play, 63-yard drive. He flipped a screen pass that Tony 
Boles turned into a 45-yard touchdown play at the 2:25 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Boles weaved his way through the Iowa defense down the right side of the field 
and dragged safety Eddie Polly the final three yards into the end zone as the 
Wolverines moved ahead, 23-6. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa cut the deficit to 23-12 on Matt Rodgers' 18-yard pass to Peter Marciano. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which punted only once, then controlled the ball for more than six 
minutes before J.D. Carlson kicked a 22-yard field goal with 8:58 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 21, Purdue 3 -- Carlos Snow rushed for 149 yards and two touchdowns 
as the Buckeyes beat the Boilermakers in an error-filled game at Columbus, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, a junior, carried 18 times and scored on touchdown runs of one yard and 
three yards as Ohio State improved to 4-2 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The victory marked the first time Ohio State has won two games in a row in John 
Cooper's two seasons as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (1-5 and 0-3) had seven fumbles and lost one, while Ohio State 
fumbled three times and lost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 28, Minnesota 18 -- Anthony Thompson rushed for a career-high 216 yards 
and three touchdowns, moving within one touchdown of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. career record, to lead the Hoosiers at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the nation's rushing and scoring leader this season, had both of 
Indiana's first-half touchdowns and scored again on a 16-yard run with 29 
seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
His 58 regular-season touchdowns is one short of the record set by Army's Glenn 
Davis in 1946 and tied by Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett in 1976. Overall, including 
bowl games which are not counted in NCAA statistics, Thompson has 61 career 
touchdowns and a Big Ten record 370 points. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 4-2 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin 35, Northwestern 31 -- Running back Leon Hunt rushed for a 
career-high 116 yards and scored three touchdowns as the Badgers held off a 
late charge by the Wildcats at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin is 2-4 and 1-2; Northwestern 0-6 and 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin quarterback Lionell Crawford, benched after the first two games this 
season, got the start and scored two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards before 
hurting his knee late in the game.

<TEXT>  Records: Stanford is 16-13, Wisconsin is 15-14.; Stanford update: The Cardinal
enters this second-round game of the National Invitation Tournament after
beating Houston 93-86 Wednesday. The game marked the return of F Andrew
Vlahov, who missed the previous 11 because of an ankle injury. G Kenny Ammann
scored a career-high 29 points in that victory, and Stanford shot 60 percent
from the floor against the Cougars.; Wisconsin update: The Badgers, who
finished seventh in the Big Ten Conference, won their first-round game 87-79
over Bowling Green in overtime on Wednesday. F Willie Simms paced Wisconsin
with a career-high 31 points, including six in OT. Simms is the team's leading
scorer at 14.5 points. The Badgers, who own victories over Michigan State and
Illinois, lost to Stanford 70-66 in the teams' last meeting, during the
1976-77 season at Maples Pavilion.; Key to the game: Vlahov's ankle. If it
holds up for 35 minutes as it did Wednesday, the Cardinal can win.  </TEXT>

MICHIGAN, IOWA FIND LIFE ON ROAD TOUGH

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who thinks winning on the road in the Big Ten isn't difficult should try 
persuading Bill Frieder, the coach of 10th-ranked Michigan, and Tom Davis, the 
coach of eighth-ranked Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were upset Saturday, as the Wolverines were beaten by Minnesota, 
88-80, and the Hawkeyes lost to Wisconsin, 65-54. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Williams Arena is becoming a tough place to play for ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota won its fourth consecutive home game against a ranked team when it 
beat Michigan. The Gophers have defeated Illinois (then No. 1), Iowa (No. 5), 
Ohio State (No. 15) and Michigan in their last four games in Williams Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, 6-5 in the Big Ten, has been the conference's surprise team. 
</P>
<P>
"If this ballclub doesn't win another game, it's surpassed all my 
expectations," Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said. "We're 14-7. We're going to 
be a .500 ballclub even if we lose our last seven games. You can't take that 
away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Burton scored five of his 27 points during a 33-second span late in the 
game to put Minnesota ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
"We play hard at home and we win," Burton said. "I'm happy about it. But we're 
better than a .500 team." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder thinks Minnesota is better than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Minnesota really played a great game," he said. "They certainly didn't 
surprise us. That's the way they played against Iowa and Illinois and some of 
the rest of them up here." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is 18-5 overall and 6-4 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
At Madison, Wis., the Badgers not only upset the Hawkeyes, but limited them to 
their lowest point output of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (17-6, 5-5) never got closer than five in the second half in losing its 
second straight. The Hawkeyes entered the game averaging 91 points and had not 
been held below 67. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the aggressors at both ends and they never let us get running," 
Davis said. "It looked for a while like we would but then all of a sudden we 
didn't score in a while. With the tempo of the game, we couldn't get into the 
flow with our running game." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes moved to within eight points with 3:42 left on B.J. Armstrong's 
basket, but Trent Jackson and Tom Molaski made four free throws each and the 
Badgers increased their lead to 58-43 with 1:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson led all scorers with 24 points. Wisconsin (13-7, 5-6) ended a six-game 
losing streak to Iowa, including a 78-70 loss earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 93, Kansas 80 -- Senior guard Byron Irvin scored 22 points, including 
several key baskets in the second half, to help the No. 3 Tigers win the Big 
Eight game at Columbia, Mo., and give assistant coach Rich Daly his first 
victory in relief of the hospitalized Norm Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri, 21-4 overall and 7-1 in the Big Eight, won as Stewart watched from a 
hospital bed for the second consecutive game. He was stricken with a bleeding 
ulcer Thursday on Missouri's flight to Oklahoma, one day after the suspension 
of top assistant Bob Sundvold. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive loss for Kansas (16-8, 3-6). 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 86, Northwestern 69 -- The No. 7 Illini broke the game open in the 
second half, going on a 23-4 run to build a 60-35 advantage with 13 minutes 
remaining in the Big Ten game at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Hamilton sparked the surge with two quick baskets and Nick Anderson 
added a free throw before the Wildcats could score their first basket. Kenny 
Battle then added two free throws and a basket and Marcus Liberty made two more 
baskets, including a three-pointer, before the Wildcats scored again. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, 20-3 and 7-3, reached the 20-victory mark for the seventh straight 
season. Northwestern, led by Walker Lambiotte's 24 points, is 8-13 and 1-10. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 92, St. John's 69 -- The No. 9 Orangemen used their fast break to run 
away from the Redmen in the Big East game at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, which avenged a 65-63 loss to St. John's earlier this season, 
improved to 21-4 and 7-4 in the Big East. St. John's is 13-8 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse began the second half with a 12-2 run and went on to lead by 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 83, Villanova 77 -- The No. 11 Pirates, who had lost eight straight 
to the Wildcats, and had not won on Villanova's home court in 15 years, came 
from behind to win the Big East game at Villanova, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, helped by three-point shots by Gerald Greene and Morton, took its 
first lead three minutes into the second half and was ahead the rest of the 
way. Kenny Wilson's two free throws brought Villanova within 67-63 with 4:39 
remaining, but Seton Hall then went on a 9-1 spurt. 
</P>
<P>
John Morton scored 23 points for Seton Hall, 21-4 overall and 8-4 in the Big 
East. Villanova is 13-11 and 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 76, Marquette 73 -- Eric Knox scored 28 points, including 18 on 
three-point baskets, and Gary Payton added 24 at Milwaukee as the Beavers gave 
Coach Ralph Miller his 668th career victory, making him sixth on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Knox made his fifth three-point goal to give the Beavers (16-5) a 66-63 lead. 
Tony Smith pulled Marquette to within 66-65 with 4:48 left. Knox scored the 
next five points. 
</P>
<P>
Smith got Marquette (9-10) to within 73-71 on a jam off a steal, but the 
Warriors could get no closer. A Knox basket and three free throws by Payton 
accounted for the Beavers' final points. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 86, Maryland 60 -- A 16-0 run that covered five minutes during the first 
half helped the No. 14 Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast Conference victory at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
All five starters contributed to the run that helped Duke take a 22-8 lead. The 
Blue Devils, who shot 57.9% for the game, are 17-4 overall and 6-4 in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is 8-14 and 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 81, Michigan St. 75 -- Jerry Francis scored a career-high 27 points 
and led a late surge that helped the No. 16 Buckeyes in a Big Ten game at 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State, unbeaten in nine home games, improved to 17-6 overall and 6-4 in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State, which lost its third straight game, is 12-8 and 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 100, Penn State 67 -- Steve Berger scored 22 points, Chris Brooks 
had 20 and Herbie Brooks added 19 as the No. 15 Mountaineers extended the 
nation's longest winning streak to 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia, 18-2 overall, 12-0 in the Atlantic 10, has won the last eight 
games against Penn State played in Morgantown, W.Va., and 12 of the last 14 
games in the series. The Nittany Lions are 13-10 and 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 75, Wake Forest 70 -- Dennis Scott scored 22 points and Tom 
Hammonds 19 as the No. 20 Yellow Jackets held off a late rally in the ACC game 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech, 16-7 overall and 5-3 in the ACC, held a 10-point lead with a 
little less than 6 minutes remaining before Wake Forest cut the lead to 72-70 
on Sam Ivy's basket with 44 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Demon Deacons (11-10, 2-7) failed to score after that and the Jackets made 
the front end of three one-and-one free throw situations in the final 34 
seconds, one each by Brian Oliver, Hammonds and Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State 122, Tennessee 106 -- Freshman guard Chris Jackson scored 50 
points at Baton Rouge, La., to help keep the Tigers in first place in the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's 50 points was the most ever scored in the LSU Assembly Center. Pete 
Maravich, college basketball's all-time leading scorer, finished his career at 
LSU before the Assembly Center was built. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, second-leading scorer in the country, had a 53-point game against 
Florida earlier this season. He is averaging just under 28 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
LSU is 17-6 overall and 9-3 in the SEC. Tennessee is 14-7 and 7-5.

<P>
Ohio State tuned up for next Saturday's Big Ten showdown against No. 13 Iowa by 
routing Northwestern, 48-7, Saturday at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our squad to enjoy this victory tonight," Ohio State Coach John Cooper 
said, "because starting tomorrow afternoon everything will be about Iowa. We 
probably won't even look at this film tomorrow. . . . Maybe we ought to start 
working on (Iowa) tonight, as good as they are." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes will play the Hawkeyes at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State was never threatened against the Wildcats, scoring on its first six 
possessions. Raymont Harris scored two touchdowns and Kent Graham came on to 
throw a pair of touchdown passes as the Wildcats were assured of their 19th 
consecutive losing season. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about the ballgame was that we won handily, we played a lot of 
players and didn't have any serious injuries," said Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Frey sustained bruised ribs during a third-quarter sack, but Cooper said 
he expected his senior quarterback to be available for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State improved to 5-2-1 overall and 3-1-1 in the Big Ten by winning its 
third game in a row. Northwestern is 2-6 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smith rushed for 128 yards in 23 attempts for the Buckeyes, who built a 
27-7 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Michigan 38, Purdue 13 -- Allen Jefferson scored three touchdowns on 
short runs, but it was the Wolverines' special teams that did the most damage 
in this Big Ten game at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Ware scored once on a blocked punt and recovered a fumbled kickoff to 
set up another score for the Wolverines (5-3, 3-2). 
</P>
<P>
"We've always said and every coach will tell you, you can't overemphasize the 
importance of special teams," said Michigan Coach Gary Moeller. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue's Fred Akers, whose team dropped to 1-7 and 0-5, said: "Mistakes in the 
kicking game in the first half usually are disastrous. Those really were." 
</P>
<P>
Ware went 17 yards after Dave Ritter's block and recovered a fumble of the 
ensuing kickoff that set up a 16-yard touchdown pass play from Elvis Grbac to 
Desmond Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson, who carried the ball only six times for 24 yards, scored on runs of 
two and three yards and one yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, who intercepted two Eric Hunter passes in the first half, led 
31-6 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 45, Indiana 20 -- Hyland Hickson ran for 170 yards and scored 
three second-half touchdowns as the Spartans overcame a shaky first half and 
beat the Hoosiers in a Big Ten game at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Tico Duckett ran for 150 yards and a touchdown for Michigan State (4-3-1, 3-2), 
and quarterback Dan Enos added two short touchdown runs. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (4-3-1, 1-3-1) took advantage of Michigan State turnovers to lead, 
20-17, at halftime. But it was Indiana's turn to blunder in the third quarter. 
Ernie Thompson fumbled at the Hoosier 46 and the Spartans were in the end zone 
seven plays later, with Hickson scoring from 13 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Hickson then capped a 64-yard drive with an eight-yard run to put Michigan 
State ahead 31-20. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble by Indiana's Vaughn Dunbar was recovered by linebacker Dixon Edwards 
at the Indiana 39, and Michigan State scored four plays later on a 15-yard run 
by Duckett to lead 38-20. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's last serious comeback bid ended when, after driving 53 yards to the 
Michigan State 27, Thompson was thrown for a two-yard loss on fourth and one. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 21, Wisconsin 3 -- Tailback Mark Smith scored two touchdowns and 
Chuck Rios added a third and the Gophers held the Badgers to 36 yards rushing 
at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
The victory keeps Minnesota's Big Ten championship hopes alive. The Gophers are 
5-3 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a freshman, rushed for 73 yards in 20 carries and scored on a four-yard 
run in the first quarter and on a 16-yard shuffle pass from Scott Schaffner in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin is 1-7, 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
This was the 100th meeting between these two schools. Minnesota leads the 
series, 55-37-8.

CARLSON'S KICKS HELP MICHIGAN BEAT ILLINI

<TEXT>
<P>
J.D. Carlson tied a school record with five field goals as No. 19 Michigan 
defeated No. 17 Illinois, 22-17, in a Big Ten game Saturday at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we felt we beat a great Illinois football team," said 
Michigan Coach Gary Moeller. "I knew they would be back after they got blown 
out (54-28 by Iowa) last week." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson equaled the mark set by Mike Gillette in a 22-7 win over Minnesota on 
Nov. 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of field goals were really crucial," Carlson said. "It was a lot of 
strategy out there today. If I had missed, Illinois could have come down and 
put up some touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
His 51-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter bounced off the 
crossbar and through the uprights. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, 6-3 overall and 4-2 in the Big Ten, led 19-3 after three 
quarters and got a key interception by Vada Murray at their own two-yard line 
with six minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan then ran out the clock, driving to the Illinois 22 before time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my fault," Illinois quarterback Jason Verduzco said. "I read it wrong. 
I shouldn't have thrown it down there, but I did." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for the Fighting Illini (6-3, 4-2) who have 
lost five in a row to Michigan and haven't won at Ann Arbor since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson kicked field goals of 28, 51, 19, 18 and 18 yards. Freshman Ricky 
Powers, who ran for 113 yards in 23 carries, had a three-yard run for 
Michigan's only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Wax, who had four catches for 64 yards, caught a 30-yard touchdown pass 
from Verduzco and Wax tossed a 26-yard scoring strike to Steven Mueller for the 
Illini, whose other points came on a 32-yard field goal by Doug Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan had 432 yards, 303 on the ground. The Illini, held to 13 first downs 
and possession time of 20:04, had 215 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 28, Minnesota 16 -- The Spartans eliminated the Gophers from the 
Rose Bowl race by defeating them at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State (5-3-1, 4-2) kept its slim Rose Bowl chances alive, moving 
within one game of Iowa, which lost to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, who close the season against Northwestern and Wisconsin, have 
already lost to Iowa. Michigan and Illinois are also 4-2 and Ohio State is 
4-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State has already announced that it will appear in the John Hancock 
Bowl (formerly Sun Bowl) in El Paso, Tex., if it doesn't win the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland Hickson rushed for 97 yards and Tico Duckett had 76 to lead a Spartan 
ground game that gained 242 yards against Minnesota. Each ran for a touchdown, 
as did Courtney Hawkins and quarterback Dan Enos. 
</P>
<P>
All four Michigan State touchdowns capped long, ground-oriented drives. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's lone bright spot was the passing of Marquel Fleetwood, who missed 
the last game with a collarbone injury. He completed 16 of 27 passes for 164 
yards and scored on an 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 20, Wisconsin 7 -- Vaughn Dunbar rushed for 161 yards and one touchdown 
and Rob Turner scored on a 67-yard pass play as the Hoosiers beat the Badgers 
in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory in five weeks for Indiana (5-3-1, 2-3-1) and the 11th 
consecutive conference loss over two seasons for Wisconsin (1-8, 0-6). 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bonnell added field goals of 43 and and 41 yards as the Hoosiers kept 
alive their hopes for a bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue 33, Northwestern 13 -- Eric Hunter ran for two touchdowns and passed for 
another in leading the Boilermakers over the Wildcats in a Big Ten game at 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter completed 17 of 28 passes for 185 yards before leaving the game late in 
the third quarter with a bruised knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (2-7, 1-5) scored 21 points in the third quarter and Jarrett 
Scales returned a blocked punt 18 yards for a touchdown in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern dropped to 2-7 and 1-5.

A month ago, Minnesota had the worst defense in the Big Ten. After three games, 
the Gophers ranked last in every team defensive category and were giving up an 
average of nearly 36 points and 493 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same defense that shut out No. 20 Indiana, 12-0, Saturday at 
Minneapolis to keep the Gophers in a tie for the Big Ten lead. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Gutekunst took more direct control of the defense after a 56-0 loss 
to Nebraska, and the move seems to be paying off. With the defense showing 
steady improvement, Minnesota is 4-2 overall and 3-0 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers' shutout of Indiana was their first since blanking Illinois, 21-0, 
in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't an ordinary Hoosier team that the Gophers stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers (4-1-1, 1-1-1) entered the game averaging 41.8 points a game, 
fourth in the nation and tops in the Big Ten. They also led the conference with 
280.4 yards rushing per game and were third in total offense with 426.4 yards a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers held Indiana to 166 yards, including 63 in 27 rushes. Vaughn 
Dunbar, the Big Ten's No. 3 rusher with 109 yards a game, was held to 11 yards 
in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers got all their points -- two field goals and a one-yard sneak by 
Marquel Fleetwood -- after big defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Illinois 15, No. 24 Michigan State 13 -- Doug Higgins' fifth field goal 
of the game, a 48-yarder with 42 seconds to play, enabled the Illini (5-1, 3-0) 
to beat the Spartans (2-3-1, 1-2) at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-yard pass from Jason Verduzco to Steven Mueller helped set up the winning 
kick 59 seconds after John Langeloh gave Michigan State a 13-12 lead with a 
35-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins opened the game with a career-long 55-yard field goal and also 
converted on kicks of 28, 36 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois held a 9-3 lead before Michigan State drove 84 yards in 12 plays for a 
touchdown, with Dan Enos bootlegging the final yard for the score. It appeared 
the Illini had stopped the drive when Mel Agee sacked Enos at the 15, but a 
facemask penalty put the ball on the five, and Enos finally scored on fourth 
down for a 10-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins' 27-yard field goal with 7:27 left made it 12-10, but the Spartans 
drove to the 17 and got a 35-yard field goal by Langeloh to make it 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern 44, Wisconsin 34 -- Bob Christian carried 42 times for 220 yards 
and one touchdown and caught passes for two more at Evanston, Ill., as the 
Wildcats (2-4, 1-2) won a Big Ten game for the first time since November, 1988, 
when they beat Purdue, 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers (1-5, 0-3) haven't won a conference game on the road since winning 
at Evanston in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 42, Purdue 2 -- Flanker Jeff Graham caught passes for two touchdowns 
and threw to quarterback Greg Frey for another as the Buckeyes (3-2-1, 1-1-1) 
routed the Boilermakers (1-5, 0-3) at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who had a career-high 144 yards on four receptions, made three catches 
for 96 yards in the first half and caught a 48-yard touchdown pass from Frey on 
Ohio State's first play of the second half. He scored on a 58-yard touchdown 
play and also threw a 60-yard scoring pass in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue quarterback Scott Hoffman, making his first collegiate start in place of 
injured Eric Hunter, completed 31 of 54 passes for 317 yards, but he threw five 
interceptions. The 54 attempts is one less than the school record of 55, set by 
Scott Campbell in 1982 and matched by Jim Everett in 1985.

Digger Phelps didn't go for the tie because Notre Dame needs victories. 
</P>
<P>
Elmer Bennett made a three-pointer as the buzzer sounded and the Irish, making 
their annual run for the NCAA tournament, beat fourth-ranked Syracuse, 66-65, 
Saturday at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the three," Phelps said. "We were going all out and Elmer makes a 
great shot on a great pass from (LaPhonso) Ellis." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (14-8) won its first of six road games against ranked teams, ending 
Syracuse's 37-game nonconference home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse's last nonconference home loss was to Navy and David Robinson in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 32,747 fans, short of the 32,820 who watched 
Syracuse defeat Connecticut this season. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Owens' basket gave Syracuse (18-5) a 65-63 lead with four seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish called a timeout with two seconds remaining, but officials added a 
second on the clock. That gave Notre Dame enough time for Ellis to get the 
inbounds pass upcourt and into the hands of Bennett, who penetrated to the top 
of the key and launched an uncontested shot that sent Syracuse to its second 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was going to be long," Bennett said. "It seemed like it 
stayed in the air for 20 minutes. Then it went in and it was pandemonium." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse overcame a 13-point deficit in the final 12 minutes and took a 63-62 
lead on Stephen Thompson's layup with 1:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis made one of two free throws to make the score 63-63 with 43 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett scored 18 points, Keith Robinson had 13, Joe Frederick and Monty 
Williams added 12 apiece, and Ellis had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the 
Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Coleman scored 16 points for Syracuse, and Thompson and Owens each had 
14.

ROY MARBLE'S FREE THROW LIFTS IOWA PAST NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iowa used some aggressive rebounding and 23 points from Roy Marble to keep 
North Carolina off balance Saturday at Chapel Hill, N.C. But it took a little 
luck to put Marble on the free-throw line so the No. 9 Hawkeyes could beat the 
No. 6 Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina's Jeff Lebo missed a short jumper with 22 seconds left that 
would have broken a 97-97 tie, and a foul was called in a scramble under the 
Iowa basket. Marble, despite North Carolina protests that he had not been 
fouled, made a free throw with 11 seconds left to give Iowa (13-1) a 98-97 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Ed Horton, who missed 2 key free throws earlier, was the Iowa 
player fouled, but Marble, who made his 8 previous free throws, got the nod 
from officials after pleading: "It was me. It was me." 
</P>
<P>
Marble missed the first free throw, but he hit the second. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina Coach Dean Smith did not take a timeout to set up a play, and 
King Rice's long jumper was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (12-2) trailed by 8 points at halftime but took a 68-66 lead on 
a 3-point play by Rice with 13:41 left. It was the first of 14 lead changes in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 94, N.C. Charlotte 86 -- Andre Wiley came off the bench to score a 
career-high 29 points at Norman, Okla., including 8 in a late surge that helped 
hold off the 49ers, enabling the No. 4 Sooners to extend their winning streak 
to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey King scored 25 points and Mookie Blaylock added 24 for Oklahoma (12-1). 
North Carolina-Charlotte (6-3) got 33 points from Byron Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma, averaging 113 points per game, went cold in the second half and went 
6:44 without a field goal. A free throw by Henry Williams, who scored 22 
points, capped a 19-4 run during the Sooner drought and made the score 78-75 
with 5:18 left. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley scored 10 straight Oklahoma points as the Sooners opened an 88-78 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 84, Virginia 76 -- Christian Laettner scored 13 of his 15 points in the 
second half to rally the top-ranked Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference game at Charlottesville, Va. It was Duke's 13th straight win over 
the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia (7-5 overall, 0-1 in the ACC), which has not beaten Duke (11-0, 2-0) 
since the first round of the 1983 ACC tournament, held a 38-35 halftime lead, 
led by Richard Morgan with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, a senior guard, finished with a career-high 31 points but was hampered 
by foul trouble in the second half. He picked up his fourth personal with 18:31 
remaining and the Cavaliers leading, 43-38. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner, a 6-10 freshman, scored 12 of Duke's next 15 points, including 9 
straight in one stretch. He capped the run with a lay-in and free throw that 
put the Blue Devils ahead to stay, 53-50, at the 14:46 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 90, Seton Hall 66 -- Junior forward Derrick Coleman had 21 points to 
lead a balanced Syracuse attack and the No. 2 Orangemen handed No. 10 Seton 
Hall its first loss in the Big East game at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, bouncing back after its first loss of the season Wednesday night 
against Pittsburgh, never has lost to Seton Hall (13-1, 2-1) at the Carrier 
Dome in 9 meetings. The Orangemen are 18-1 overall against the Pirates since 
conference play began. 
</P>

Syracuse (14-1, 1-1) used its pressure defense to start a 17-4 run that turned

shots, Pervis Ellison hit a jumper, Payne scored 2 more baskets before Tony 
Kimbro capped the rally with a free throw at the 1:39 mark, giving the 
Cardinals their largest lead, 78-62.

technical for flipping his towel in the face of referee Ted Valentine with 7:25 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Jeff Gross narrowed the lead to 34-28. But Rice had 6 points

</P>
<P>
Missouri 84, Colorado 75 -- The Buffaloes led, 61-58, after 2 free throws by

CRUM SEES IT COMING, LOUISVILLE CAN'T GET GOING IN LOSS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Louisville Coach Denny Crum saw in his team a lack of enthusiasm as it prepared 
for Thursday night's game against Cincinnati and therefore was not surprised 
that the Bearcats came away with a 71-66 upset over the No. 8-ranked Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old adage that you get what you earn, and we earned a loss," Crum 
said. "I knew before the game we weren't ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Starks scored five of Cincinnati's final 11 points as the Bearcats turned 
back a late charge to win the Metro Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to go out and play hard, get the rebounds and stick them back 
in," Starks said. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which faces UCLA Sunday, turned the ball over 15 times and its 
starting guards, LaBradford Smith and Keith Williams, were one of 14 from the 
field. Cincinnati scored 15 points off Louisville mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in lackadaisical," said Louisville center Felton Spencer, who scored 
19 points. "We haven't been going as hard in practice the last two or three 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (9-2) rallied from a 37-26 halftime deficit to lead, 59-58, on 
Everick Sullivan's breakaway dunk with 4:07 remaining. But Cincinnati (8-3) 
regained the lead for good, 61-59, on Starks' three-point play with 3:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati, which posted its second victory in a row over Louisville in Freedom 
Hall, got 18 points from Banks and 15 apiece from Andre Tate and Levertis 
Robinson. Starks finished with 14. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 93, Wichita State 66 -- Terry Brown led five Jayhawks in double 
figures with 18 points as they made a school-record 11 three-point shots to win 
easily at Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (14-0) made eight three-point baskets in the first half to bring the 
Shockers (4-7) out of their zone defense, and took a 52-30 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Illinois 73, Wisconsin 59 -- Kendall Gill, whose eligibility was restored 
by the NCAA earlier in the day, scored 20 points and led the Illini over the 
Badgers in the Big Ten Conference opener for both teams at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Kaufmann added 11 points for the Illini (11-0). Danny Jones had 21 points 
and Willie Simms 18 for Wisconsin (9-4). 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bardo and Gill, considered one of the top backcourt duos in the country, 
were declared ineligible after officials learned they were not asked to follow 
all the steps on loan applications for used cars in 1989 -- a technical 
violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the NCAA determined that the loan terms were appropriate and 
proper payments were being made, both players' eligibility was restored. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State 87, No. 11 Louisiana State 80 -- Doug Hartsfield made a pair 
of breakaway baskets early in overtime and added two free throws with 22 
seconds left to lead the Bulldogs to a Southeastern Conference victory at 
Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
In beating LSU for the fifth consecutive time, Mississippi State (8-2, 1-1) 
used a school-record nine three-point baskets and beat the Tigers (7-2, 0-1) in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore All-American guard Chris Jackson, who scored 14 of the Tigers' 16 
points in overtime, had 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico St. 81, Pacific 60 -- James Anderson scored 16 points and Reggie 
Jordan added 15 as the Aggies held the Tigers to 30% shooting in winning the 
Big West game at Las Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State (11-1, 2-0) won its ninth in a row, matching its longest 
winning streak since winning a school-record 16 in a row in 1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 92, Tulane 68 -- Irving Thomas scored 23 points and Tharon Mayes 
had 22 as the Seminoles won the Metro Conference opener at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Christian scored 16 points and Anthony Reed 14 for Tulane (2-7), which 
played its first Metro game since the 1984-85 season, when the school suspended 
basketball after a point-shaving scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 88, Wake Forest 82 -- Tony Massenburg scored 21 points and the 
Terrapins equaled their 1989 Atlantic Coast Conference victory total by winning 
the opener at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 91, Utah State 66 -- Carrick DeHart scored 20 points and Gary 
Grey added 18 to lead the Gauchos in a Big West game at Santa Barbara.

SYRACUSE'S QUICK START FINISHES CONNECTICUT WIN STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syracuse got off to a quick start and Connecticut finished strong, but the 
sixth-ranked Orangemen emerged from Saturday's Big East Conference game with a 
90-86 victory at Syracuse, N.Y., before a Carrier Dome record crowd of 32,820. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Derrick Coleman scored a career-high 29 points as Syracuse avenged last 
month's 70-59 loss in Hartford, Conn. The Orangemen, who ended the Huskies' 
10-game winning streak, have won six consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"We really got out to a good start and that's what we had to do against this 
team," said Syracuse forward Stephen Thompson, who added 19 points. "Last time 
we came out slow and we never did get going. This time we wanted to come out 
fired up and do the job right." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Owens, who scored 21 points for Syracuse, said: "I think we kind of 
shocked them a little bit. We wanted to get out to a big start on them early, 
because when we get that kind of jump early, it's hard for anybody to catch up 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
But No. 8 Connecticut almost did. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse led, 81-71, with 2:10 to play, but the Huskies chipped away down the 
stretch. Syracuse made 17 of 22 free throws over the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"About a month ago when we beat Syracuse, people asked me what was wrong with 
Syracuse," said Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun. "I said, 'Nothing. Syracuse is a 
great basketball team.' Tonight, they put us in a hole early, and they didn't 
let us out of that hole. And we're not an easy team to keep in such a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse is 18-3, 7-3 in the Big East. Connecticut (20-4, 7-3) was led by Chris 
Smith's 25 points, all in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Missouri 107, Nebraska 85 -- Doug Smith scored 44 points, including 12 in 
a 23-9 run beginning the second half, as the Tigers won their 29th consecutive 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 6-foot-10 senior whose previous career high was 32, fell just two 
points shy of Missouri's single-game record. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (22-2, 8-1 in the Big Eight Conference), whose top ranking fell into 
jeopardy Thursday night with a 65-58 loss at Kansas State, appeared listless in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith scored six of the first eight points in the second half to help turn 
a close game into a rout. The Huskers (9-12, 2-6), who earlier in the week 
snapped a 17-game road losing streak with a 91-82 victory at Colorado, were led 
by Rich King with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 88, Iowa State 83 -- Kevin Pritchard scored 18 points and the 
Jayhawks took advantage of a four-point play late in the game to move into 
position for a return to the top of the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (24-1, 7-1 in the Big Eight) had to survive a shaky final minute to 
break a six-game losing streak at Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
Four other players scored in double figures for Kansas, which hosts Missouri on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (7-13 and 2-6) lost for the seventh time by five points or less. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas was clinging to an 82-81 lead when Mark Randall was fouled by Brian 
Pearson as Jeff Gueldner hit a jump shot from the top of the key. Randall made 
both free throws for an 86-81 lead with 1:03 left and the Jayhawks held on. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor 82, No. 3 Arkansas 77 -- David Wesley scored eight of his 23 points in 
the final two minutes at Waco, Tex., as the Bears avenged an earlier 99-84 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor's victory also snapped a 12-game Arkansas winning streak and handed the 
Razorbacks their first loss in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley, who missed 11 games because of a stress fracture of the right leg 
before returning on Wednesday against Texas, hit six free throws and got a 
basket off a steal in the closing minutes. For the game, Wesley hit 12 of 12 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 70-70, before Wesley took charge. The Hogs scored only two 
baskets in the final 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas was led by Lee Mayberry, who had 16 points. Todd Day, who was 
averaging 20 points, was held to nine. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas dropped to 20-3 and 11-1 in the SWC. Baylor is 13-9 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Duke 114, Maryland 111 -- Phil Henderson scored nine of his 26 points in 
overtime after the Blue Devils had to rally from an 11-point deficit in the 
final five minutes of regulation at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (18-4, 8-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) came back from a 103-102 
deficit in overtime with seven consecutive points, four by Henderson and three 
by Alaa Abelnaby, with 1:16 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After Jerrod Mustaf, who scored a career-high 35 points for Maryland, converted 
a three-point play eight seconds later, Christian Laettner hit the front end of 
a one-and-one free throw opportunity to give Duke a 110-106 lead with 42 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner led Duke with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Evers Burns then made a layin with 31 seconds left to get Maryland within 
110-108, but Henderson made two free throws two seconds later and Bobby Hurley 
sank two more to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, which lost for the 11th time in 12 games to Duke, dropped to 13-10 
and 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Georgetown 56, Florida 40 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 10 of his 14 points 
during a 16-1 first-half run to lead the Hoyas in a nonconference game at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (19-2) has won four consecutive games. Undermanned and undersized 
Florida (6-13) has not won since Jan. 13, dropping eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown trailed 9-1 and 15-10 before rallying behind Mourning to take a 
26-16 halftime lead. The Hoyas, who got 15 points from Mark Tillmon, never let 
the lead slip below nine points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Poole scored 12 points for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Louisiana State 119, Tennessee 113 -- Chris Jackson scored 49 points at 
Knoxville, Tenn., including 10 three-point baskets, as the Tigers took over 
first place in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson scored 17 points in a 31-13 run midway through the second half as LSU 
(19-4, 9-3) broke away from a 61-61 tie to take a 92-74 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston scored 43 points for Tennessee (12-9, 7-5). The Volunteers fought 
back to within 112-106 on a three-point basket by Greg Bell with 1:49 to play, 
but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 La Salle 99, Manhattan 78 -- Lionel Simmons scored a career-high 40 
points and moved past Elvin Hayes into eighth place on the NCAA scoring list in 
a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle (19-1, 10-0) never trailed in opening a 45-38 halftime lead. The 
Explorers pulled away with 16 consecutive points, seven by Simmons, that made 
the score 66-42 with 13:43 to play. Manhattan dropped to 9-13 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 Georgia Tech 94, No. 15 Louisville 84 -- Kenny Anderson scored four 
points and had four assists in a 17-7 run to open the second half as the 
visiting Yellow Jackets remained unbeaten outside the Atlantic Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech (16-4) made 21 of 29 field goals in the second half (72%), after 
hitting only 14 of 34 (41%) in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Scott led Georgia Tech with 30 points and Anderson finished with 29 
points, 12 assists and eight rebounds. LaBradford Smith scored 23 points for 
Louisville (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Michigan State 84, Ohio State 75 -- Steve Smith scored 25 points and

stretch in a Big Ten Conference game at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State (19-5, 8-3) made 14 of 23 shots from the field in the second

<TEXT>     "Whenever I go home, my mom teases me about my big butt," said Lincoln, a
senior defensive back. "Today, that big butt paid off for us.";   The loss
probably ended Notre Dame's hopes for a shootout for No. 1 against the Florida
State-Miami (Fla.) winner in the Fiesta Bowl.;   "This is the most difficult
loss I've ever been associated with," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said. "It's
the most disappointed I've ever been in my life.";   The Irish (8-2) led 31-7
late in the first half. Then Tennessee's Floyd Miley returned a blocked field
goal 85 yards for a touchdown 14 seconds before intermission.;   Tennessee
quarterback Andy Kelly threw for three TDs, the last to Aaron Hayden with 4
minutes, 3 seconds left. Notre Dame moved 66 yards to the Tennessee 9 to set
up a field-goal try. With Hentrich on the sideline with a leg injury, Leonard
got the call.;   "It felt good," Leonard said. "But then I heard the thump. I
looked up, and I realized it didn't have enough to get there.";   Lincoln, who
came in untouched from the left side, said: "I overran it, and I felt it hit
my rear end. It was the biggest play of my career, thanks to my behind.";

Oklahoma State Coach Pat Jones said.;   Colorado Coach Bill McCartney
downplayed the call, saying if Fauria wasn't open or wasn't far enough
downfield for a first down, James would have thrown it away and the Buffaloes
would have kicked on fourth down.; MICHIGAN 59, NORTHWESTERN 14: In Ann Arbor,
Mich., Desmond Howard scored on the first play and finished with 201

(3-5-1, 1-4) for 428 rushing yards in a 56-16 Big Eight romp in Columbia, Mo.
Missouri entered the game with the worst run defense in Division I-A. . . .
Jason Verduzco completed passes to 10 different receivers in the first half as

Hawkeyes (5-1, 2-1) had failed on five previous possessions in Illinois
territory in the second half. But they were able to stay in the game because
the defense blanked the Illini (4-2, 2-1) after giving up 250 yards and 21
points in the first half.;   The Illini's first conference loss allowed
Michigan to take sole possession of first place in the Big Ten.;   It was
Iowa's second straight come-from-behind victory. Rodgers threw a touchdown
pass with less than a minute to play in a 10-6 win at Wisconsin last weekend.;
  Iowa began its winning drive on its 31 with 9:05 left. Rodgers' 23-yard pass
to Danan Hughes on third-and-eight from the Iowa 43 kept the Hawkeyes moving,
and Rodgers scampered 11 yards on a draw play on third-and-five at the

the Buffaloes for the third straight year. Other than Nebraska, the last
conference team to beat the Sooners three consecutive times was Kansas State

an on-campus altercation, scored 13 points in the final 8:10 as the Seminoles 
(16-14, 6-8) held off a pair of late rallies by the Gamecocks.

NEWSWIRE: FORMER BADGER COACH JARDINE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Jardine, former Wisconsin football coach who had a heart transplant last 
year, died Friday morning of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for University of Wisconsin Hospital said Jardine's death was not 
due to rejection of a donated heart he received in transplant surgery on June 
16, 1989 at UW Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine, 54, was admitted to the hospital Wednesday when he complained of 
shortness of breath. His condition worsened and he was unconscious and being 
maintained on life support systems in intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine was the Badgers' coach in 1970-77, posting a 37-47-3 record in eight 
seasons. His only winning season was in 1974, when the Badgers went 7-4, 
including a 21-20 upset of Nebraska in a nationally televised game. In 1977, 
the team started 5-0 and won a spot in the top 20 rankings only to lose its 
last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine resigned Nov. 7, 1977, after the fourth consecutive defeat.

IT'S NOT PRETTY, BUT KANSAS GETS 85-74 WIN OVER OKLAHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After helping No. 2 Kansas to a sloppily played, 85-74 victory over 
ninth-ranked Oklahoma at Lawrence, Kan., Kevin Pritchard glanced at a score 
sheet and shook his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot 38%," he said. "That's kind of mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the rematch of the 1988 NCAA finalists, the Jayhawks (22-1, 5-1 in 
the Big Eight) led the nation with a field goal percentage of 54.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think this team could shoot that bad," Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sooners (15-3, 4-2) were held almost 40 points below their season 
average of 112.5 points by a Kansas defense that kept switching and 
experimenting throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Oklahoma was without its No. 2 scorer and No. 1 rebounder, William 
Davis, who did not make the trip because of disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
There were 55 fouls in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard and Rick Calloway led a Kansas run that halted Oklahoma's lone rally 
in the second half and assured the Jayhawks of their 14th consecutive win at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners cut Kansas' lead to 53-48 with about eight minutes left, but 
Pritchard's two free throws ignited a 15-6 run that put the game out of reach. 
Calloway, who led the Jayhawks with 20 points, scored eight in that stretch and 
Pritchard had four. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Michigan 77, Wisconsin 63 -- Both teams were missing key players, but the 
Wolverines' superior depth enabled them to win the Big Ten game at Madison, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (16-4, 6-3) was without third-leading scorer Sean Higgins, who 
sustained a stress fracture in his left foot in a 91-72 loss to Purdue last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers were without second-leading scorer Willie Simms, who was declared 
academically ineligible by the NCAA Friday. Simms dropped a class during the 
week, which put him below the NCAA minimum of 12 credits. He later added a 
class, making him eligible for Thursday's game at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mills scored 20 points for the Wolverines and Loy Vaught added 18. 
Wisconsin's Danny Jones had 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Georgetown 74, No. 18 St. John's 67 -- The Redmen lost their third game 
in a row, but they also lost power forward Jayson Williams, who reinjured his 
right foot three minutes into the Big East Conference game at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, St. John's second-leading scorer and leading rebounder, missed the 
first 10 games of the season because of a fracture in his right foot suffered 
in the first week of practice. He averaged 15.7 points and 8.3 rebounds since 
returning from the injury in October. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (17-2, 7-2), remained tied for the Big East lead, took advantage of 
Williams' absence, fouling out starting center Rob Werdann and his backup, Sean 
Muto, with more than six minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown made just four baskets in the final eight minutes, but the Hoyas 
made 11 of 16 free throws, three of the misses coming in the last two minutes 
when the outcome was apparent. St. John's (17-6, 6-4) led, 37-32, at halftime 
after closing the half with a 10-1 run.

<P>
The Orangemen (16-3) have won four in a row, three on the road. Florida State 
(13-10) has lost six of its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Owens sparked a 24-11 run that gave Syracuse a 42-27 halftime lead. Derrick 
Coleman scored nine points in the first four minutes of the second half as the 
Orangemen extended the lead to 55-32. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 64, No. 8 Purdue 53 -- Steve Smith made seven free throws in the 
final two minutes at West Lafayette, Ind., to help the Spartans deal the 
Boilermakers their first Big Ten loss of the season.

Purdue (16-3, 8-1), made only 29% of its shots, but rallied from a 14-point 
deficit to pull to within four points on Woody Austin's three-point shot with 
1:33 left. Smith, who had 22 points, then made two free throws. After Austin 
missed a three-point shot, the Spartans (17-5, 6-3) got the rebound and Smith 
made two more foul shots with 1:09 left to make it 61-53. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Connecticut 92, Providence 77 -- The Huskies extended their winning 
streak to nine games with an easy Big East victory at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Smith, who led Connecticut with 21 points, and John Gwynn helped the 
Huskies (19-3, 7-2) take a 21-point lead with 9:55 left. The Friars (12-7, 5-5) 
could get no closer than 13 the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 La Salle 89, Iona 73 -- The Explorers, led by Doug Overton, scored 24 of 
the game's final 32 points to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game 
at New Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle (16-1, 7-0) led at halftime, 47-37, but Iona (8-12, 3-6) fought back 
and took its first lead at 59-58 on a steal and dunk by Joey Johnson with 12:28 
left. Kevin Cooper's tip-in extended the Gaels' margin to 61-58. 
</P>
<P>
Overton ended a 3:52 scoring drought for La Salle with a basket that cut Iona's 
lead to 61-60 with 9:20 left. With the score tied at 65, he keyed a 13-2 run 
with seven points. He made two free throws, a three-point shot and made both 
ends of a one-and-one, giving the Explorers a 78-67 lead with 2:59 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Georgia Tech 90, Maryland 84 -- Dennis Scott scored 17 of his 26 points 
in the second half and the Yellow Jackets twice rallied from 11-point deficits

Xavier (17-2, 6-1) trailed, 44-40, at halftime as Dayton (11-8, 4-3) shot 56% 
and Walker made just one of five shots and committed five of 14 Xavier 
turnovers. But Walker made two layups early in the second half to put the 
Musketeers ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 94, Villanova 82 -- Darelle Porter and Brian Shorter led a pair of 
second-half runs that carried the hot-shooting Panthers to their third 
consecutive victory in a Big East game at Pittsburgh, despite a Big East record 
15 three-point baskets by Villanova.

Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (13-6, 6-4) rallied from a 75-65 deficit to within 79-75 on Jody 
Patton's two free throws with 1:36 remaining. But Kentucky (10-10, 6-5)

10 years. 
</P>
<P>

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / MAL FLORENCE;

<P>
COACH'S BARK WORSE THAN UNDERDOG BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some things never change, particularly football coaches saying they're worried 
about an out-manned opponent that they'll most likely beat by 40, 50, 60 points 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
However, Nebraska's Tom Osborne is aware that laudatory remarks about an 
outclassed team are subject to ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers will open the season Saturday against Northern Illinois, and 
Osborne, after cautiously observing that Nebraska "can have a good team," 
added: "But I do think it will be unrealistic for the fans to expect us to go 
out there and put on a tremendously polished performance because, No. 1 -- and 
I'm not going to say anything more about this because every time I do I get 
laughed out of the state -- they have a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Start chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Northern Illinois has a good team, in its class, one that had a 7-4 
record last season while beating the likes of Middle Tennessee State and 
Southwestern Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
And Northern Illinois did beat Wisconsin of the Big Ten last year, but who 
didn't? The Badgers had a 1-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, beginning its 100th year of football, is ranked No. 4 nationally in 
the latest Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Cornhuskers don't figure to lose many games this season with a 
nonconference schedule of Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota and Oregon State 
along with the predominately weak schedule in the Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's Joe Paterno is also concerned, publicly at least, in anticipation 
of playing Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We are coming off a losing season (5-6), and I think our kids are realistic 
that they are playing a very good football team," Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
That losing season didn't include a loss to Virginia, though, as Penn State won 
easily, 42-14. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but Virginia does have an edge -- as Paterno noted. The Cavaliers have "a 
game under their belt." 
</P>
<P>
He could have said that the Cavaliers were belted by Notre Dame, 36-13, in a 
game that was not as close as the score indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Will a coach ever say, "We play Possum College next week and we just scheduled 
the game instead of having a scrimmage"? 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of mismatches, Oklahoma opened the season last Saturday by 
toying with New Mexico State, 73-3. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma led at halftime, 38-0. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State Coach Mike Knoll, whose team is 4-30 in three-plus years, put 
the game in its proper perspective when he said: 
</P>
<P>
"We got beat offensively, defensively, in the kicking game, and we got 
outcoached. But nothing is ever as good as it seems, or as bad as it seems." 
</P>
<P>
It was Oklahoma's first regular-season game since the Sooners were put on three 
years' probation last December by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. The 
sanctions prevent the Sooners from appearing on live television this year and 
in bowl games for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have something to prove this year," Oklahoma offensive tackle Mark 
VanKeirsbilck said. "We want to show the fans and coaches we are a class team 
and a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's opening 19-3 victory over Stanford Saturday night in Tucson was 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
It was also an indication that it may be a long season for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
In Dennis Green's debut as coach, Stanford couldn't consistently protect its 
quarterback, redshirt freshman Steve Smith. Moreover, the Cardinal, 
historically a passing team, could gain only 34 net yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has an inexperienced offensive line, having lost five of its top seven 
players and three starters. 
</P>
<P>
How good is Southern Mississippi, which upset sixth-ranked Florida State, 
30-26, last Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden conceded that Southern Mississippi is a top-20 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Seminole halfback Dexter Carter has even higher regard for the Golden Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the teams that play them better watch out," he said. "They could 
be in national championship contention." 
</P>
<P>
Mismatch of the week: Miami vs. Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to get a victory under my belt just for the heck it," new Miami 
Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
That's as good a reason as any, considering that third-ranked Miami is a 28 
1/2-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising quote of the week is courtesy of Detroit Lions Coach Wayne Fontes, 
who said in assessing former USC quarterback Rodney Peete: "His talent has 
surprised us." 
</P>
<P>
Does Fontes live in a cave? In four years as USC's quarterback, Peete broke 
every meaningful school passing record, took his team to the Rose Bowl twice 
and was runner-up last year in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested USC Coach Larry Smith: "He didn't accomplish all of that by riding a 
bicycle around campus."

MICHIGAN TURNS BACK SETON HALL AGAIN IN REMATCH, 91-86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight months ago, he sealed Michigan's national championship victory over Seton 
Hall with a pair of free throws in overtime. In Saturday's rematch, Rumeal 
Robinson was again instrumental in leading the Wolverines over the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson scored 11 of his 26 points in the last eight minutes as No. 6 Michigan 
held off a late Seton Hall surge to win, 91-86, at Thomas &amp; Mack Center in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall lost all five starters from last year's squad, while Michigan 
returned four. "Therefore, it was just a basketball game we knew we had to come 
in here and win," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit to take a 75-74 lead with 
6:24 left in the game before Robinson answered with a three-point basket to put 
Michigan ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 11 of his team's last 21 points as Michigan (8-1) won its eighth 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Robinson's free throws in the closing seconds of overtime proved 
decisive in the Wolverines' 80-79 win. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Volcy had 25 points and Oliver Taylor 21 for Seton Hall (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Nevada Las Vegas 97, No. 16 Iowa 80 -- David Butler marked his return to 
the lineup with 18 points and the Rebels' smothering defense took its toll on 
the Hawkeyes in the first game of a doubleheader at Las Vegas.

THE PACIFIC 10; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A LONG WAY FROM PARITY TO CORVALLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific 10 football coaches constantly talk about parity, saying that the 
conference is relatively strong from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite, if early-season results are any indication. 
</P>
<P>
The league apparently has a doormat in Oregon State. The Beavers have already 
played the two weakest teams on their schedule, losing to Montana, 22-15, and 
to Kansas, 38-12. If Oregon State can't beat Nevada Las Vegas Saturday, it 
figures to be a long season for Coach Dave Kragthorpe's team in Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska lies ahead, and so do seven Pac-10 teams -- Stanford, Arizona, 
Washington State, UCLA, Arizona State, USC and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, coming off a 59-10 rout by Virginia, recorded eight sacks for 70 yards 
in losses while building a 31-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks, a perennial second division team in the Big Eight, aren't 
accustomed to routing anybody. The Jayhawks haven't had such an easy time since 
they beat Kansas State, 38-7, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It's the oldest ruse in any playbook, but it still works. 
</P>
<P>
We're referring to the gimmick play, the fumblerooskie. 
</P>
<P>
It worked for Air Force against Notre Dame last year, and it worked again for 
Arizona against Illinois Saturday night in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Rick Martin ran 24 yards for a touchdown around the right side with a 
purposely fumbled handoff as his teammates -- and Illinois players -- dashed 
off in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy gave Arizona a 21-3 lead on its way to a 28-16 victory over the 
previously 11th-ranked Illini. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Quiz: California's John Hardy ran 100 yards to a touchdown with an 
intercepted pass against Wisconsin, tying a Pac-10 record held by five other 
players, three from UCLA. Can you name them? 
</P>
<P>
Glyn Milburn originally wanted to attend Stanford and signed a letter of intent 
to that effect. It was invalid, however, because it wasn't signed by a parent 
and Milburn was 17 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
So the former Santa Monica High star enrolled at Oklahoma, the school his 
stepfather favored. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn played as a true freshman under Barry Switzer in 1988, gaining 124 
yards in eight carries, and scoring a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he turned 18 and no longer needed his parents' approval of his 
choice of schools, he transferred to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, 175-pound Milburn sat out the 1989 season but is now a 
multipurpose threat as a ballcarrier or kick return specialist for the 
Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn is a cousin of Rod Milburn, the 1972 Olympic gold medalist in the 
110-meter high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't have beaten USC today," said Washington center Ed Cunningham after 
the Huskies had hung on to beat San Jose State, 20-17, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, San Jose State also extended Washington before losing, 35-31. 
</P>
<P>
In barely getting by the Spartans, the Huskies maintained a recent trend, as 
noted by guard Dean Kirkland. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've been here, this team plays to its level of competition," he 
said. "Every game is close. For some reason, we rise (or fall) to the level of 
the opponent, whether it's the No. 1 or No. 100 team." 
</P>
<P>
Quiz answer: California's Jim Jurkovich against USC, 1940; UCLA's Jimmy Allen 
against Cal, 1973; UCLA's Alan Dial against Oregon State, 1986; Arizona's Chuck 
Cecil against Arizona State, 1986, and UCLA's Dennis Price against California, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Bruce Snyder said he has a physical football team after the Bears' 
28-12 victory over Wisconsin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal had 38 running plays and threw 22 passes. Last year, the Bears passed on 
seven out of 10 plays with quarterback Troy Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin, though, may not be an accurate gauge of Cal's new prowess. The 
Badgers were 2-9 last season. More will be known about Cal after it plays Miami 
Saturday at Berkeley.

Ten Conference victory over the 13th-ranked Buckeyes (6-2, 3-2) in Columbus,
Ohio.;   Iowa's players wore all-black helmets in memory of three Iowa
professors and a graduate student shot to death Friday by another graduate
student, who later killed himself. All the emblems, including the Tiger Hawk

was in Columbus when the shooting occurred, and the decision was made to
proceed with the game. A moment of silence was observed before the game.;  
"That tragedy back in Iowa City is so sad that I know it had a big part of us
winning, because I think our guys just gave that 20 percent extra effort,"
Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said.;   Rodgers completed 20 of 27 passes for 258 yards
before leaving the game with a sprained ankle late in the third quarter.;  
Ohio State, which came in averaging 255 yards rushing, was limited to 124
yards on the ground and 97 passing.;   It was only Iowa's second road win over
Ohio State since 1960. The game was played before 95,357, the largest crowd
ever at expanded Ohio Stadium.; MICHIGAN 42, PURDUE 0: Desmond Howard had 169
all-purpose yards, scored two touchdowns and tied two NCAA records as the
fourth-ranked Wolverines (7-1, 5-0) routed the Boilermakers (3-5, 5-2) in a
Big Ten game in Ann Arbor, Mich.;   Howard has caught TD passes in eight
consecutive games this season, tying the single-season record set by Auburn's
Terry Beasley in 1971. Howard also has caught TD passes in 10 consecutive
regular-season games, tying the record set by BYU's Mike Chronister in
1976-77.;   Elvis Grbac's two touchdown passes gave him 22 for the season,
breaking his school record of 21 set last year.; NOTRE DAME 38, NAVY 0: Rick
Mirer set a Notre Dame record for touchdown passes, throwing for three scores
and a career-best 303 yards as the No. 5 Irish (8-1) crushed the Midshipmen
(0-8) in South Bend, Ind.;   Mirer's 17th TD pass of the season broke the
school mark set by Bob Williams in 1949 and tied by John Huarte in 1964 and
Joe Theismann in 1970.;   Navy, which lost for the 28th consecutive time to
the Irish, matched its worst-ever start of 1948, when the Midshipmen went
0-8-1 before winning.; OKLAHOMA 28, KANSAS STATE 7: Mike Gaddis ran for 191

It was a day of upsets in college basketball, as six of the top seven teams 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
The only team to survive was No. 4 Missouri, which defeated top-ranked Kansas. 
No. 2 Georgetown was upset by unranked Connecticut, No. 3 Oklahoma fell to No. 
23 Arizona, No. 5 Syracuse was beaten by Providence, No. 6 Michigan lost to 
Iowa and No. 7 Illinois lost to No. 24 Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
The upsets began at Columbia, Mo., where the Tigers, who trailed by as many as 
nine points in the first half, came back to defeat Kansas, 95-87. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime there were a lot of sad faces," said Missouri's Anthony Peeler, 
who scored 24 points. "But we just talked about treating them as just another 
team." 
</P>
<P>
It was the 26th consecutive victory at home for the Tigers (17-1 overall, 4-0 
in the Big Eight), who made 18 of 29 shots in the second half. It is also the 
second consecutive season that the Tigers have defeated a top-ranked team on 
their home court. They beat then-No. 1 Oklahoma, 97-84, last February. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks (19-1, 2-1) led, 46-43, at halftime, but the Tigers scored the 
first six points of the second half and took the lead for good with 17 minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Brown brought Kansas to within 67-65 with 10:44 remaining. The Jayhawks 
pulled to within two points of the lead on three more occasions, the last time 
at 77-75. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smith scored 23 points for Kansas, 19 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut 70, No. 2 Georgetown 65 -- The Hoyas, the only undefeated 
major-college team after Kansas was beaten earlier in the day, lost when the 
Huskies connected on seven of eight free throws in the final 1:04 for a Big 
East Conference victory at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (15-3, 5-2) broke a 60-60 tie with 3:46 left on a three-point 
basket by Nadav Henefeld and never trailed again. The Hoyas (14-1, 4-1) got as 
close as 63-62, and made it 67-65 on a three-point basket by Mark Tillmon with 
32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies held the Hoyas scoreless for the first 7:03 and had a 14-0 lead 
before Alonzo Mourning, who had 23 points, scored on a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Arizona 78, No. 3 Oklahoma 74 -- The Sooners had shooting troubles all 
day against the Wildcats. But in the end, it was the shot the third-ranked 
Sooners didn't take that gave the Wildcats the victory at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Kermit Holmes cost the Sooners (12-2) a chance at the tying basket when he lost 
the ball out-of-bounds with four seconds left. The Wildcats' Sean Rooks was 
fouled one second later and hit two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats limited the high-scoring Sooners to seven-for-28 shooting in the 
first half and 24-for-69 for the game. The Sooners, who lost Tuesday to Kansas 
State, last lost consecutive games two years ago -- to Louisiana State and 
Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
Providence 87, No. 5 Syracuse 86 -- Junior guard Eric Murdock made a jump shot 
from the foul line with four seconds to play and the Friars defeated the 
Orangemen for the first time in 11 years in a Big East game at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 86-85, the Orangemen's Dave Johnson missed the the first free throw of 
a one-and-one with 33 seconds remaining. After Murdock's shot, Richard Manning 
of the Orangemen missed a short jumper in the lane as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars (11-4, 4-2), led by Murdock's 25 points and 16 assists, ended more 
than a decade of futility against the Orangemen (12-3, 3-3), who had won 21 in 
a row from the Friars since the league was formed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 78, No. 6 Michigan 76 -- Les Jepsen scored 13 of his 19 points in the 
second half and sank the winning free throws in overtime as the Hawkeyes 
overcame a 15-point deficit to stun the Wolverines in a Big Ten game at Iowa 
City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes (9-6, 1-4) broke a five-game losing streak. The Wolverines are 
13-3, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Rumeal Robinson, who scored 22 of his 28 points for the Wolverines in the first 
half, drove the length of the court but missed a flying, off-balance layup at 
the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ingram's layup with 39 seconds left in regulation gave Iowa a 71-71 tie 
and capped a 24-9 run in which the Hawkeyes rallied from a 62-47 deficit with 
11:24 left. The Wolverines had a 44-33 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bullard led the Hawkeyes with 23 points. Terry Mills scored 15 points for 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Purdue 81, No. 7 Illinois 68 -- At West Lafayette, Ind., the 
Boilermakers turned a 17-2 second-half run into a runaway to remain undefeated 
in Big Ten play while beating a higher-ranked team for the third time in their 
last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (13-2, 4-0) scored the first four points of the game and never was 
caught, taking a 17-7 lead in the first eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini (13-3, 3-3) trailed by 12 points with 14:43 left when the 
Boilermakers put the game out of reach by scoring 10 consecutive points and 
then adding another seven for a 21-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Gill scored 23 points for the Illini. Marcus Liberty, the Illini's 
leading scorer, was eight of 18 shots.

<P>
For Iowa Coach Hayden Fry, it was "the most frustrating day in my 38 years of 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
For Ohio State, it was the latest in a string of victories. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's maligned defense had its biggest day as the Buckeyes rolled to a 
28-0 Big-Ten victory over Iowa Saturday at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by two touchdowns by Scottie Graham and two scoring passes by Greg Frey, 
Ohio State registered its first shutout in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's last shutout victory was 33-0 over Minnesota in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State entered Saturday's game having allowed 27 points per game, and the 
Buckeyes were ranked last in the Big Ten in pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
But the Buckeyes shut down the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed we would play this poorly," said Fry. "We were terrible on 
offense and terrible in execution on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the most frustrating day in my 38 years of coaching. It was my most 
disappointing loss." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fifth in a row for Ohio State, 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the 
Big Ten, and keeps alive the Buckeyes' conference title hopes. Ohio State is 
one game out of first place with two games remaining. The Buckeyes play host to 
Wisconsin, then play at Michigan Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa fell to 4-5 and 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 89,536 at Ohio Stadium watched the Buckeyes score once in each 
quarter. Graham scored on a three-yard run in the first quarter and caught a 
nine-yard touchdown pass from Frey in the third quarter. Ohio State also got 
touchdowns on an eight-yard pass from Frey to Jeff Graham and a one-yard plunge 
by Dante Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 21, Minnesota 7 -- Courtney Hawkins caught nine passes for 197 
yards, including touchdowns of three and 47 yards, in leading the Spartans past 
the Gophers at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, a sophomore, moved into second place behind Andre Rison in Michigan 
State's record book. He needs five more catches and 45 yards to match Rison's 
record of 54 receptions for 966 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Enos completed 13 of 26 passes for 240 yards as the Spartans improved to 
5-4 and 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Scott Schaffner scrambled 36 yards for the Golden Gophers' lone 
score as Minnesota fell to 5-4 and 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue 46, Northwestern 15 -- The Boilermakers scored 32 points in the first 
quarter in routing the Wildcats at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Smith got things going when he blocked a punt and returned it 35 yards for 
a touchdown. It was one of three blocked punts Purdue had in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, the Boilermakers had not scored a touchdown in the opening period in 
their last 12 games, dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Purdue's second most productive quarter ever. The Boilermakers scored 34 
points in the second quarter of a 51-6 victory over Indiana in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a seven-game losing streak for Purdue (2-7 and 1-5) as 
Northwestern (0-9 and 0-6) lost for the 10th consecutive time.

making a 25th straight postseason appearance, longest streak in the nation -- 
rallied after Ole Miss (15-15) built a 49-38 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Malik Sealy added 19 points for St. John's (16-13).

<P>
Moments after being presented with his very own day, Lionel Simmons went out 
and made it his night. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, La Salle's high-scoring forward, was presented with a proclamation 
from the governor of Pennsylvania before Thursday night's game against 
Manhattan, declaring Feb. 27 as Lionel Simmons Day in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The senior forward then went out and scored 27 points to pass the 3,000 mark 
and move into fourth place on the all-time NCAA list as No. 14 Explorers 
cruised to a 100-60 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been so nervous in my life," said Simmons, who endured a two-day 
publicity buildup while needing only three points to hit 3,000. "My legs were 
shaking at the start of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, who has a career total of 3,024 points, passed Hersey Hawkins' 3,008 
for fourth place on the list with his last basket of the first half, a 
three-point shot with 1:51 left that gave the Explorers a 44-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Maravich of Louisiana State leads the list at 3,667, followed by Freeman 
Williams of Portland State (3,249) and Harry Kelly of Texas Southern (3,066). 
</P>
<P>
Simmons became the fifth Division I player to score 3,000 points, reaching the 
milestone on a free throw with 12:44 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids years from now we'll be able to say we played with one of the 
greatest players in the history of the game," La Salle Coach Speedy Morris 
said. 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  Ohio State had a plan: Keep the ball away from Desmond Howard. It was a good
plan. But the Buckeyes couldn't make it work.;   Howard had a 93-yard punt
return, the longest in Michigan history, and finished with 213 all-purpose
yards Saturday to help the No. 4 Wolverines defeat No. 18 Ohio State 31-3 in
Ann Arbor, Mich., and clinch the Big Ten Conference championship outright.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We intended to punt the ball out of bounds all day," Ohio State Coach John
Cooper said. "Now you can see why. That punt return was the play that really
broke our backs. Desmond Howard is a phenomenal athlete. I think they ought to
give him the Heisman Trophy right now.";   Michigan (10-1, 8-0) has won six of
the past seven games from Ohio State (8-3, 5-3), including all four during
Cooper's tenure as coach of the Buckeyes. Ohio State announced moments before
kickoff that Cooper had been granted a three-year contract extension.;  
Michigan will meet Pacific 10 Conference champion Washington in the Rose Bowl
on New Year's Day. Ohio State will play Syracuse in the Hall of Fame Bowl on
Jan. 1.;   Howard had 8 yards rushing, 96 on three pass receptions, 93 on the
punt return and 16 on one kickoff return.;   Howard, a leading candidate for
the Heisman, has scored 23 touchdowns this season. His 93-yard punt return,
which put Michigan ahead 24-3 in the second quarter, broke the school record
of 88 yards by Dave Brown against Colorado in 1974.;   After hauling in a
41-yard punt by Tim Williams, Howard split two tacklers at the 10-yard line
and then broke a tackle at the 18. He moved to the Ohio State sideline, picked
up a block from Dwayne Ware at the 30 and went the rest of the way untouched.;
  "It happened so fast," Howard said. "I thought about fair-catching it
because they were coming so fast. But I thought, 'This is the Ohio State
game.' The last block was able to spring me, and it was a foot race after
that."; MICHIGAN ST. 27, ILLINOIS 24: Safety Darrin Eaton took a fumble 24
yards for a touchdown and fullback Tony Rollin scored from 1 yard as the
Spartans (3-8, 3-4) turned three turnovers into 17 points en route to a Big
Ten victory over the Illini (6-5, 4-4) in East Lansing, Mich.;   Illinois will

   Forget regional pride. Scrap neighborly
cooperation. Wisconsin and Illinois have each accused the other of
besmirching its reputation, and the weapon of choice has been
selected: Saber-edged wit.
   The two Midwestern neighbors _ which for years have squabbled
over pollution, traffic, tourists, sports teams and bragging rights
for best chili _ are at it again, slashing at one another all over
the media dueling ground.
   Chicago claims the Badger State made the first thrust when an
advertising campaign distributed postcards that used the chalkline
of a homicide victim to portray Chicago and a chalked hopscotch
game to portray the ``tranquility'' of northeastern Wisconsin.
   The Windy City parried with one of its biggest defenders,
humorist Mike Royko, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the
Chicago Tribune.
   Royko called the advertising campaign by the Fox Valley Chamber
of Commerce a cheap shot that made light of his city's serious
crime problem. He wrote a column that dismissed Wisconsin residents
as ``cheeseheads ... content to chomp on bratwurst.''
   Royko wrote that the postcard was not ``sufficient provocation
for a verbal feud,'' then proceeded to paint a picture of Wisconsin
residents as deer-hunting, red flannel-wearing, cow-kissing ``farm
folk.''
   ``From its farms to its cities, you won't find kinder, simpler
folk anywhere, except in custodial care,'' he continued.
   Given all the barbs that have been traded between the two states
over the years, Royko said he was surprised by the angry reponse
from Wisconsin residents.
   ``They were frothing at the lips _ which is kind of goofy,''
Royko said in an interview this week. ``They struck the first blow.
   ``I responded to a very tasteless card,'' he said. ``There are
many people in Chicago who have been victims of crimes. Homicide is
not a laughing matter.''
   Radio stations and marketing agencies have done their best to
continue the war of words.
   ``The attitude is that Chicagoans think that Milwaukeeans are
just a bunch of hee-haw heads,'' said Mark A. Tuschel, who added
fuel to the furor with a radio spot produced by his Chicago-based
company, CW Media.
   The commercial for Little Switzerland Ski Hill, a resort near
Milwaukee, was aired on Chicago radio stations. In it, an announcer
tells some people the resort is near Milwaukee, and the group
responds with a raspberry.
   The announcer then says, ``You don't have to stay there, you
just drive through,'' eliciting a relieved cheer from the group.
   Tuschel revised the commerical after receiving complaints from
Wisconsinites, but he said the attitudes toward Milwaukee were not
of his making.
   ``If you stand on television with a cardboard wedge of cheese on
your head, you almost have it coming,'' he said, referring to the
hats frequently worn by fans at sports events in Green Bay and
Milwaukee.
   Bill Welch, president of the Fox Valley Chamber of Commerce,
conceded his office offended some people with its postcard
campaign, which was designed to attract people to Fond du Lac,
Appleton and Oshkosh.
   The homicide-hopscotch postcard compared crime rates between the
two areas and cited FBI statistics indicating Fox Valley is among
the 10 safest regions in the United States.
   Welch said he enjoyed Royko's rebuttal. ``I thought it was kind
of cute, and frankly, we appreciated it. To our mind, anything that
draws attention to the comparisons works to our benefit.''
   Mary Ladish, marketing director of the Greater Milwaukee
Committee, said Royko's column and the subsequent responses were
both part of the ``cultural divide'' enjoyed by humorists in
Wisconsin and Illinois.
   Ladish said her committee, which studies the development of the
Milwaukee metropolitan area, isn't concerned with the
``cheesehead'' jokes.
   ``Rather than just talking about image, we are working at
changing Milwaukee's image through very tangible means,'' she said,
citing efforts to market Milwaukee and its festivals, businesses
and restaurants nationwide.
   Royko said he thought his column was ``pretty funny'' and he
extended his sympathy to people ``afflicted with the lack of a
sense of humor.''
   ``They're pretty thin-skinned,'' he said. ``You read the column
and it's obvious I wrote it with my tongue partly in my cheek.''
   Wisconsinites take note _ Royko didn't say his tongue was
entirely in his cheek.
