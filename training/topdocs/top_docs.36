THE LETTERS OF SAMUEL JOHNSON: VOLUMES I-III, 1731-1781 edited by Bruce
Redford Oxford Pounds 25 each, c400 pages
THE JOURNALS OF JAMES BOSWELL 1761-1795 selected and introduced by John Wain
Heinemann Pounds 20, 412 pages
THE POPULAR conception of Dr Johnson, derived from Boswell's Life, as the
great fulminator and layer down of the law, becomes modified when his
letters are read consecutively. A new edition of his correspondence, the
most complete so far, brings out the many-sidedness of the man: Johnson the
loving husband with a sick wife, replaced soon by Johnson the widower who is
in spite of his own grief a constant support and morale-raiser for his
friends and fellow authors, men and women. Then there is Johnson the
freelance who is his own literary agent; and Johnson the dedicated classical
scholar, part of an erudite network of friends and colleagues regularly
exchanging information. All these Johnsons come through more powerfully than
ever before.
Many of the letters are well-known - not just from previous scholarly
editions, mainly the one in 1952 from Oxford by RW Chapman - but also from
Boswell and from being printed in full in books such as John Wain's Johnson
on Johnson where the texts of letters are taken from the Chapman edition.
'Chapman', said Wain, 'worked on Johnson's letters from 1919 to 1952; what
he did not know about them, I for one am content to go on not knowing.'
Not everyone, though, was so content with the Chapman edition. The American
Johnson specialist Bruce Redford, professor of English at the University of
Chicago, has been hard at work with his students for many years on an
entirely new edition of the letters of Johnson and now we have before us the
bulk of it in three volumes. This is called the Hyde Edition: it derives
from the Hyde Collection partly formed by Mary Hyde Eccles (Lady Eccles)
without whose scholarly enthusiasm this new edition would not have been
possible.
The first volume begins in 1731: Johnson, recently down from Oxford without
a degree, writes from Lichfield to Edward Cave, editor of The Gentleman's
Magazine, trying to interest him in taking some work. By the third volume
Johnson has become a famous man, having made his name with the appearance of
his Dictionary in 1757. He writes in 1781 to his friend Mrs Thrale, the
brewer's widow, assuring her that his affection for her is not diminished.
Before his death three years later he will break with her completely.
Redford found Chapman's edition inadequate in several respects. In his three
volumes Chapman printed, all told, 1,515 Johnson letters. Redford has
discovered 52 more and he 'strongly doubts the authenticity' of four printed
by Chapman which he has dropped from the canon. A recurrent problem for any
editor is Johnson's hand-writing, which is often difficult to decipher.
Chapman spotted mistakes made by earlier editors but then went on to make
some of his own. His 'Mr J Combe', for example, in a letter of 1770, turns
out in reality to have been Henry Thrale's nephew, Ralph Plumbe.
Clearly then, Chapman's has now been superseded by this new edition. It will
be completed by a further two volumes in 1994, one of letters from 1782-84,
and one containing appendices and a comprehensive index. The ordinary reader
will wish to ask, is all this no doubt admirable scholarly work of editing
going to alter our view of Johnson radically? Many of the texts of the
letters do in fact appear here in exactly the words they appeared hitherto,
including such famous letters as the one in February 1755 to Chesterfield
about the Dictionary ('Seven years, my Lord have now past since I waited in
your outward Rooms or was repulsed from your Door . . .') and the one to
James Macpherson of January 1975 in which Johnson spiritedly refused to
retract a single word of his view that the Ossian manuscripts never existed
and that the whole thing was a fraud - as indeed it was.
Nonetheless, Redford says of his edition that it 'aims ultimately to provide
the materials for a fresh assessment of Samuel Johnson, man of letters'.
Previous editors have, in Redford's view, seriously misinterpreted Johnson's
tone in his letters to Hester Thrale, and by reading them in this edition we
may now see how crucial these letters were to Johnson's discovery of his own
potential. They do not represent a great man humouring a tiresome woman, as
earlier editors tended to think, but are evidence of a deep mutual bond.
Among the material not included at all in Chapman, there are printed here 12
letters to the novelist Charlotte Lennox, author of The Females Quixote.
These, says Redford are 'outstanding in biographical significance'.
The Lennox Collection of 42 letters came to light in the Dunfermline branch
of a Scottish bank in 1964 and was acquired by the Houghton Library, where
the letters were edited and published by Duncan Isles. His work is fully
acknowledged in the copious footnotes to the Hyde Edition. When read in
Isles's edition in the Harvard Library Bulletin, the dozen Johnson letters
in the Collection - the ones printed here by Redford - are seen to dovetail
with letters to Mrs Lennox from several other eminent men, such as Lord
Orrery, David Garrick, Samuel Richardson, 18th century English gentlemen who
went out of their way to aid this gifted woman writer.
This is not to underestimate the importance of placing those letters written
specifically by Johnson to Mrs Lennox in the chronological context of his
entire correspondence and to find confirmed the admiration that he had for
her lively mind. This enhanced view of their relations is one of the fresh
perspectives opened for all Johnsonians by the appearance of this new
edition.
Johnson and Boswell speak nowadays with two different voices to two
different audiences. One voice addresses the professors and post-graduate
students whose field is 18th century English literature. The other voice
speaks to the audience represented by - in Johnson's own words - the common
reader. Boswell's journals have always been issued in two separate editions,
a popular one with a minimum of apparatus, and a scholarly one with the full
panoply of footnotes and textual glosses.
The latest book in the popular series is the one-volume selection from all
previous editions of Boswell's journals edited by John Wain. Boswell's
amorous hopes and disappointments, encounters with the famous and the lowly,
as he set them down, are one of the greatest literary bombshells to have
exploded in our century. From them Boswell emerged as a person in his own
right quite separate from Johnson. We can conveniently sample his whole
character here.
A sense of the need for a book about Johnson not seen exclusively through
the eyes of Boswell prompted Wain to write a fresh life of Johnson in 1974
and in 1976 to edit the book Johnson on Johnson (the 1000th volume in
Everyman's Library). The common reader might find the view from its nursery
slopes a useful preliminary vantage-point before scaling the majestic
heights of Redford's great new edition of Johnson's letters.

   The intimate letter as a literary form is gone. 
The technology -- one might almost add, ideology -- of reaching out and touching someone through optic fibers and satellite beams is eliminating the letter from even its simplest role of carrying a message. 
Some collections from the 19th and 20th centuries do stand out. 
There was nothing so fine in recent decades as the letters of Flannery O'Connor, published in 1979 as "The Habit of Being." 

   But the true high point of the letter as literature was reached some 300 years ago. 
We are given deep insight into that era in a slender, specialized, but rewarding, book, "The Converse of the Pen: Acts of Intimacy in the 18th-Century Familiar Letter" (University of Chicago Press, 260 pages, $11.95), by Bruce Redford. 

   The title comes from a letter by Samuel Richardson. 
The subtitle is paradoxical in that the intimacy and familiarity of such correspondence coexists with conscious craft and mannered conventions. 
It is also ironical, viewed from today. 
These "acts of intimacy" are not those relished by the readers of bed-and-bored fiction, nor is the familiarity of the kind that breeds contempt. 
"The Converse of the Pen," in the precise meaning of Hamlet's words, is "caviar to the general" -- the general run of people -- many of whom will not acquire a taste for it. 

   All devotees of Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, and their circle, know that 18th-century conversation was a performance, consciously shaped by its best practitioners of either sex, notwithstanding its improvisational nature. 
Letter writing was the sister art in "the unique craftsmanship of that age." 

   Six writers of letters are discussed by Mr. Redford, with passages from their letters in many moods, and secondary attention paid to their correspondents. 
The writers are: the prolific Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; two poets, William Cowper and Thomas Gray; the nobleman, politician, litterateur Horace Walpole; and James Boswell, biographer and keeper of journals. 
Finally, Samuel Johnson, whose letters to Mrs. Hester Thrale are called by Mr. Redford, "The 'Little Language' of the Public Moralist." 
They reveal Johnson in a mood of easy geniality unique in his writings, though later it modulates into anguish as the friendship ends, due to his disapproval of the widowed Mrs. Thrale's second marriage. 

   Although we are given many splendid excerpts, this is not a collection of complete letters but a discussion of their form, purposes and significance as revelations of character. 
This scholarly book, with many footnotes, pre-supposes a reader's familiarity with 18th-century English history and literature. 
There are many passages in French, untranslated; also, in Latin, translated except for the stray phrase. 

   Reliable report esteems Mr. Redford as a fine teacher at the University of Chicago. 
His own writing is uneven. 
At times one wishes it were de-academicized into the "easy Simplicity of Stile" in which Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was tutored. 
He rises to his best in the section on Samuel Johnson who, for all the distinctions of the others, is incomparably the enduringly great figure among those considered. 
(Mr. Redford is preparing a four-volume edition of the letters of Johnson.) 

   The account of that zealous correspondent, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, is another highlight of the book. 
Classically stoical, "She feels herself alone: a woman of superior intellect and learning who courts ridicule when she displays either; a wife of tender sensibilities married to an unresponsive husband; a friend mistrusted by most of her circle." 
With satirical wit she gives (as does Horace Walpole) wickedly funny verbal sketches of scenes and persons at the coronation of George III. 

   Least engaging are the two poets, though each strives for "the paradox of artful naturalness." 
Cowper builds a protective shell against the world, "a little Eden," in his country retreat. 
I agree with Lytton Strachey, who found Cowper's letters "stricken with sterility." 
Thomas Gray displays a literary allusiveness so compulsive that he seems to have no thoughts or phrases that are not shadows cast by someone else. 

   Mr. Redford dubs Horace Walpole "The Letter-Writer as Chameleon" (Walpole attributed such shifting stylistic coloration to himself). 
We see him in "a richly varied parade of identities: the vivacious gazetteer, the choleric politician, the equable historian, the aristocratic butterfly, and the meditative moralist" -- any or all of them, when writing to different persons about the same events. 

   "James Boswell among the 'Libertines'" deals sympathetically with the ever-ambitious, vulnerably insecure Scotsman's friendship and correspondence with Henry Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, one of the notorious rakes and great charmers of his time. 

   Boswell, watching Samuel Johnson writing to Mrs. Thrale, "wondered to see him writing so much so easily." 
It is that ease and openness that so charms in the closing chapter. 
"In all this," Johnson says in one letter, "there is nothing very memorable, but sands form the mountain." 
He promotes superbly, in Mr. Redford's words, "that sharing of experience which not only bridges a physical gap, but also turns absence into a rarefied form of presence."

Boswell's Life of Boswell

<TEXT>
   It is surprising to find James Boswell recording a spasm of reaction against his great, deceased friend, Samuel Johnson, upon whose "Life" he was then toiling. 
On Friday, March 7, 1788, he read Mrs. Hester Thrale Piozzi's published correspondence with Johnson. 
The former Mrs. Thrale and Boswell had always felt jealousy over each other's friendship with the lexicographer. 

   Boswell writes in his journal for that day that he is "disappointed a good deal," especially "in having proof of (Johnson's) fawning on a woman whom he did not esteem because he had luxurious living in her husband's house; and in order that this fawning might not be counteracted, treating me and other friends much more lightly than we had reason to expect. 
This publication cooled my warmth of enthusiasm for 'my illustrious friend' a good deal. 
I felt myself degraded from the consequence of an ancient Baron to the state of an humble attendant on an author; and, what vexed me, thought that my collecting so much of his conversation had made the world shun me as a dangerous companion." 

   In spite of that momentary bitterness of the Scottish baron (Laird of Auchinleck), it was as an author that he himself was happiest and holds his high place in English letters. 
One of his best friends, Edmond Malone, often "lectured me upon my intemperance and on my delaying Johnson's 'Life,' on which I was to rest my fame." 

   The passages come from "Boswell: The English Experiment, 1785-1789" (McGraw-Hill, 354 pages, illustrated, $24.95), edited by Irma S. Lustig and Frederick A. Pottle, and the next to last volume of the unparalleled journals, published in trade editions by arrangement with Yale. 
In today's jargon it could have been called "Boswell Under Stress." 

   His wife, "Peggie," the former Margaret Hamilton (her portrait is the frontispiece), was dying of consumption. 
The strains of the four years recorded here made the ordeal worse for both of them. 
Utterly unable to remain faithful to her, he still loved her dearly and excoriated himself for his weaknesses. 
Accepting an invitation to dinner, "I was inwardly shocked at my rage for pleasure, which made me leave a distressed wife, who never would have left me, even in the slightest illness." 
He rationalizes that, had he remained home, he would have "fretted and done my wife more harm than good." 

   The "experiment" of these years was his rash attempt to move, with his whole family, from his "narrow" field of law in Edinburgh to build a practice in London. 
The legal systems of Scotland and England differed greatly at that time. 
The transition was not successful. 
Ironically, his obsession to try it endorsed the rough jest Samuel Johnson addressed to him when they first met: "Sir . . . the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England!" 

   Not long after beginning this effort, in 1786, Boswell confided to his journal: "The truth is that imaginary London, gilded with all the brilliancy of warm fancy as I have viewed it, and London as a scene of real business, are quite different; and as the changes of fanciful sensation are very painful, it is more comfortable to have the duller sensation of reality." 
Yet he persisted in his fancy. 

   He deplored Johnson's "fawning" but is ruthless with himself as he records his own humiliating currying of favor and quest for patronage from a brusquely abrasive man, James Lowther, first Earl of Lonsdale. 
The editors rightly call the sharp characterization of Lonsdale an outstanding feature of the book. 

   Boswell's true friends are also vividly present. 
Edmond Malone, the major Shakespearean editor of the 18th century, was working on his celebrated edition of the plays. 
Yet he aided Boswell in editing and seeing through the press "The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides," published in 1785 -- Boswell's account of the famous walking trip about which Dr. Johnson also had written. 
Malone constantly exhorted Boswell to work on the "Life." 
After the biographer's death, Malone edited the third through the sixth editions of the massive work. 
Ms. Lustig justly says of Malone: "Few persons have contributed so selflessly and significantly to the work of another." 

   The best facets of Boswell's complex nature won him not only the devoted friendship of Johnson but also of such men as Malone, Sir Joshua Reynolds and John Courtenay. 
These and one or two others, who had been known as the Literary Club in Johnson's time, now took to calling themselves "the Gang." 
Their presence, with a host of other eminent persons, makes these journals an extraordinary portrait of an era in British literature, art, intellect and politics. 

   This volume closes with the well-attended funeral of Margaret Boswell, in Scotland. 
The writer and his two young sons, summoned from London, arrived too late. 
At Auchinleck, "my second daughter came running out from our house . . . in a burst of tears," with the account of Peggie's death. 
"I cried bitterly and upbraided myself for leaving her." 

   He writes: "It is not customary in Scotland for a husband to attend his wife's funeral. 
But I resolved if I possibly could to do her the last honors myself, and I was able to go through with it very decently. 
I privately read the funeral service over her coffin in the presence of my sons and was relieved by the ceremony a good deal." 

   A 14th volume yet to come will bring the Boswell chronicles to a close.

<HEAD>Washington's Johnson Crowd Furious Over `This Loathsome Book'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The people who worked for Lyndon Johnson in
this town are buzzing _ and often furious _ about a new biography
of their old boss that says he stole his election to the Senate in
1948.
   ``Why, why, why would a man want to spend this much of his life
writing about a fellow that he can't stand and whose reputation he
is so passionately bent on destroying?'' demands an injured Jack
Valenti, an aide in Johnson's White House.
   ``I think it is a dishonest biography,'' says Bob Hardesty, who
used to write Johnson's speeches and helped him write his memoirs.
``I don't think it pretends to be fair. I think it is the work of a
man with a burning, unnatural hatred for his subject. It only
presents a dark, evil, negative side of Lyndon Johnson.''
   The book, ``Means of Ascent,'' by Robert Caro pictures a
youthful Johnson who is willing to do almost anything to appease an
all-consuming political appetite.
   It is the second of Caro's projected four-volume LBJ biography.
Caro already has devoted 14 years to the task. The first volume met
with equal hostility from some Johnson fans. One book critic said
it demonstrated ``enraged animus against Lyndon Johnson.''
   The new volume is just out, but excerpts ran in the New Yorker
magazine and they were the talk of Washington's Texas community.
   Ex-Texas newspaperman Bob Mann, now teaching at Emory &amp; Henry
College in southwestern Virginia, says this week's mail brought
three sets of Xeroxed copies of the excerpts from friends who were
afraid he might miss them.
   Caro, in the book's introduction, acknowledges that he paints a
portrait of a despicable person.
   While ``bright and dark'' threads run through most of Johnson's
life, Caro writes, no bright thread is visible in a period when
Johnson ``was all but totally consumed by his need for power and by
his efforts to obtain it.''
   The book covers the years from Johnson's 1941 defeat for a
Senate seat in a rigged election to his 1948 victory _ by 87 votes
_ in a 1948 Democratic runoff over an enormously popular former
governor, Coke Stevenson.
   The theft by Johnson of that primary election has been fixed in
Texas lore for years, but Caro provides new evidence.
   The book also says Johnson pulled strings in Washington to
enhance the power and value of a Texas radio station that made him
a millionaire.
   And it says Johnson made shamelessly political capital from his
war career _ which amounted to flying under enemy fire for only a
few minutes, then accepting a Silver Star from Gen. Douglas
MacArthur.
   ``He didn't seize the Silver Star,'' says Horace Busby, a
Johnson associate for 20 years. ``MacArthur, who was a political
general, gave it to him to curry favor with Franklin Roosevelt, who
liked Johnson. What was Johnson to do _ throw it back?''
   As for LBJ's stolen election, Busby says: ``Johnson went before
a statewide electorate seven times after that and it was never a
factor.''
   Caro's critics say his legwork is meticulous and his writing
thrilling, but his viewpoint warped. They say he finds little good
_ or balanced _ to say about Johnson and nothing bad in Stevenson's
record, despite his touch of racism.
   History buff Jeff Patterson, an aide to Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, says Stevenson comes across as ``Saint Coke.''
   ``Caro sets out to make Johnson look like a real jerk,'' says
Patterson. ``Give me warts-and-all, but don't try to overdo it.''
   Political reporter David Broder, reviewing the book in The
Washington Post, said Caro's Johnson is ``a complete scoundrel''
and ``a lying, cunning, utterly unprincipled operator.''
   Caro did not respond to messages asking for a reply. ``We don't
want to respond to a single review,'' said Paul Bogaards, publicist
for Alfred A. Knopf, which has printed 250,000 copies of the book.
   Former Johnson aide Lloyd Hackler says Caro ``puts more emphasis
on the negatives _ and God knows Johnson had those _ than on the
positives,'' but adds: ``Its probably the best job of research that
anybody has ever done on Johnson.''
   Valenti calls Caro's work ``this loathsome book'' _ but admits
he read every word of the serialization and now will proceed to
read the book whole.
   Valenti mourns the impact the book is likely to have on
Johnson's place in history.
   ``Caro writes engagingly and that torments me,'' he says. ``This
may become the definitive Johnson biography.''
   But Hardesty says he has no such worries: ``Over a period of
time, when the historians have their say, he'll come out a
full-bodied figure, flawed but an attractive man who had a great
impact on the country.''

   Former President Lyndon B. Johnson bragged he was
a World War II hero, but he actually observed only 13 minutes of
combat, according to a book to be published next year.
   An excerpt from ``Means of Ascent'' published Monday in the New
Yorker magazine claims the Silver Star that Johnson said he won for
his heroism in World War II was awarded merely as a political
gesture by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
   The book, by Robert A. Caro, will be the second volume of his
comprehensive biography of Johnson, covering the former president's
``hopelessness and despair'' from 1941 to 1948.
   Caro writes that in the years after the war Johnson ``portrayed
himself as a war-scarred veteran of many battles on many fronts.''
   Actually, Caro says, Mr. Johnson saw combat in the South
Pacific, only as an observer, ``for a total of 13 minutes.''
   ``Not only did Johnson accept the Silver Star,'' the New Yorker
serialization says, ``he arranged to accept it in public. Several
times. Buying the decoration (in an Army-Navy store in Washington),
he took it to Texas, where, in a number of public appearances, it
was affixed to his lapel as if for the first time.''
   Caro said ``Johnson rapidly came to feel not only that he
deserved it but that he deserved more: that the Silver Star was not
a sufficiently high honor for such heroism as his.''
   George Christian, Johnson's presidential press secretary, said
Monday he never heard Johnson brag about his war record.
   ``I never heard him embellish it, although he did wear his
little Silver Star in his lapel,'' Christian said. ``It's
conceivable. A lot of people in World War II like to imagine they
did more than they did.''
   Caro's first volume, ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to
Power,'' was published in 1982 and won the National Book Critic's
Circle Award for non-fiction.
   Earlier, Caro won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of New York
power broker Robert Moses.
   Caro said Monday he spent four years near Austin researching
Johnson's early years. He said what emerged from his interviews was
a portrait less flattering than those found in some of the 17
Johnson biographies published before his.
   ``Texans are very honest,'' he said. ``They will not lie to you.
If you can find the right question, they will answer.''
   Lady Bird Johnson, the former president's widow, stopped
cooperating with him early in his research, Caro said. But former
Texas Gov. John Connally decided to talk to Caro only after reading
the first volume. Connally granted four days of interviews.

century poet

DR JOHNSON AND MR SAVAGE
by Richard Holmes
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 260 pages
THE LAST we heard of Richard Holmes was that he was engaged on a massive
life of Coleridge. The first volume - Coleridge: Early Visions - appeared a
couple of years ago to a bevy of appreciative reviews including the one in
this newspaper by the present reviewer. Having got Coleridge poised in
mid-career, Holmes seems to have temporarily deserted him to take a little
holiday. Holmes's idea of a holiday being to write a book, a shorter book
that required much less research - and the result is Dr Johnson &amp; Mr Savage.
One might be tempted to call it a quickie, but like everything Holmes does,
it is carefully written and argued.
The material mainly comes from printed sources, the chief being Dr Johnson's
Life of Richard Savage. In popular editions of Johnson's Lives of the Poets,
such as the Worlds Classics, this Life appears as one among many. The bulk
of them were written on commission by Johnson when he was famous as prefaces
for an edition of the English poets' works in several volumes. But the Life
of Savage was written and published more than 30 years earlier than the
others, in 1744.
Johnson wrote it the year after Savage died - at the behest of Edward Cave,
the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, the journal that printed work by
both Johnson and Savage. It was in Cave's office above the medieval arch at
St John's Gate in Clerkenwell (still there) that Johnson and Savage probably
met. Johnson was then an obscure young man of letters recently married;
Savage at 41 an established poet, capable at short notice of turning out
ringing panegyrics in rhyming couplets on anything under the sun. A bond of
friendship soon formed.
Both were penniless. They were so poor that they would spend the night
pacing the streets of London in animated literary discussion until dawn.
Savage also had more disreputable friends with whom he would go
pub-crawling. On one of his late-night visits to a tavern in the their
company, Savage became involved in a brawl in which a man was killed during
a sword-fight. Johnson was not present but gives an account of this in the
Life.
Savage was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of murder. It
was only after a vigorous campaign by his friends in high places that a
royal pardon was obtained. And it was after his release from prison that
Savage's career really took off with poems like 'The Bastard' - Savage
claimed he was the illegitimate son of the Countess of Macclesfield - and
'The Wanderer', enshrining his basic fantasies about himself. Then after a
period of glory his life took a turn for the worse again and he died
disgraced.
Savage was one of those impossible people who possess enormous, irresistible
charm until they become completely stoned when they turn into colossally
aggressive bores. He emerges in Holmes's account as a singular instance of
the Poet as both Charmer and Sponger, a kind of 18th century Dylan Thomas.
And Holmes reveals how thoroughly the young Johnson surrendered to Savage's
appeal.
Disappointed at not being made poet laureate by George II, Savage appointed
himself what he called 'Volunteer Laureat' to Queen Caroline and wrote an
annual poem in her honour - a splendid example of Savage's chutzpah, in
reward for which the Queen, who had a weakness for poets and flattery,
granted him an annual sum. But on her death this was discontinued, and
Savage was on his uppers again. A group of well-wishers and poets led by
Pope, generous in his private dealings, banded together to make up the
deficit on condition Savage left London for good and took up residence in
rural Wales where - they vainly hoped - he would keep out of mischief.
Exhibit B in Holmes's exhumation of the relations between Johnson and Savage
is Johnson's 'London: A Poem' (printed by Cave in 1738, the poem with which
Johnson first began to make a name for himself among the literati). In it
the poet laments the departure of a friend - one Thales - from London to
Wales: 'Tho' Grief and Fondness in my Breast rebel/ When injur'd Thales bids
the Town farewell . . .'
Much scholarly ink has been expended on the question of whether the hero of
the poem may be interpreted as being Savage. Holmes thinks he is and he sees
the poem as the forerunner of the Life of Savage. But in his Life of
Johnson, Boswell denied that Savage was Thales. The Boswellians point to the
poem's Latin original - the Third Satire of Juvenal. The original contains a
figure called Umbricius who leaves Rome in disgust at its mores to reside in
the country and Thales, they say, is merely a fictitious equivalent.
Holmes sees this as an attempt by the Boswellians to cover up Johnson's
early friendship with the scapegrace bard. Johnson had studiously not
revealed that he was the indigent nocturnal friend in his Life of Savage. It
was a youthful episode now best forgotten, incompatible with Johnson as the
stern moralist, the judgmental father-figure. John Wain endorses the lasting
influence of Savage on the young Johnson, in his biography of Johnson, but
says he 'cannot see that 'London' would have been any different if Johnson
had never met Savage'.
Holmes does us a double-service - firstly by reviving interest in the
raffish yet attractive figure of Savage who died in 1743 in Bristol's
Newgate jail; and secondly in positing a rather different, a more radical
and bohemian Dr Johnson, to complement the traditional figure of the Great
Tory Cham. But in his final claim that Johnson's Life of Savage also makes
him the founding father of the modern literary biographer, Holmes presses
his case a little too far.
Unlike those contemporary biographers who are able to set aside years of
their lives to complete their tasks, accumulating overwhelming detail,
Johnson was a literary journalist working severly against the clock. He
relied heavily on the 18th century tradition of anecdotes and is on record
as saying: 'I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of
Savage at a sitting; but then I sat up all night'. With respect - the
correct lineage is not Johnson, Holroyd, Holmes, Glendinning; but Johnson,
Sainte-Beuve, Strachey, Nicolson, Connolly.

<TEXT>
   President Lyndon Johnson was an ``awesome engine
of a man'' whose personality and deeds cannot be captured in a
book, a former aide said Thursday at a 25th anniversary symposium
celebrating LBJ's 1965 inaugural.
   Lady Bird Johnson and daughters Luci Turpin of Toronto and Lynda
Robb of McLean, Va., were among several hundred people who attended
the symposium of friends and former associates.
   Jack Valenti, special assistant to Johnson in 1963-66, said,
``Nobody knows better than the people in this room that Lyndon
Johnson was many-sided, contradictory, and no one near him, with
the exception of his wife, ever took the total measure of the man.
   ``And so it will be, that none of the written, or yet to be
written, volumes will be definitive on the work President Johnson
performed, on the deeds that he accomplished and on the flaws he
exhibited.''
   Valenti referred to the controversy raging over the second
volume of a three-volume biography of Johnson. The author, Robert
Caro, portrays the former president as a man without scruples who
stole his 1948 election to the U.S. Senate.
   Valenti, now president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said Caro's latest book, ``Means of Ascent,'' and the
earlier volume fall short _ ``way short.''
   ``Every Caro word is dipped in curare, every Caro page squirmed
with loathing. The cards are marked, the deck is stacked,'' he said.
   ``Almost anything that you could say about LBJ had a tinge of
truth except one thing _ you could never say he was dull,'' Valenti
said. ``He was an awesome engine of a man, and you and I in this
room will never, ever again see his like.''
   Former Democratic vice presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, a
Johnson assistant in 1965-68, said the United States ``needs
desperately the vision of a Kennedy and the political genius of a
Johnson and their can-do spirit to get our nation moving again.''
   ``Yes, I've read and heard about Kennedy's alleged womanizing,
and Johnson's alleged theft of an election,'' Shriver said in a
reference to Caro's version of Johnson's narrow 1948 U.S. Senate
victory over former Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson, who was lionized in
the book as a Texas hero.
   ``The only perfect man I've ever heard of is Jesus Christ and
the only perfect woman was his mother, Mary,'' Shriver said. ``So,
I'm not looking for any miraculous reincarnation of virgin birth _
most certainly I'm not looking for a Coke Stevenson.''
   The symposium, co-sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin
and LBJ Library, continues through Saturday.
   Johnson, who became president after the Nov. 22, 1963,
assassination of John F. Kennedy, won the White House on his own in
1964. He retired to his ranch west of Austin in 1969 and lived
there until his death in 1973.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: A chest for wild thoughts - Alannah Hopkin reads the
young Samuel Beckett's only novel, which is being published posthumously
next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPEARANCE of Beckett's first novel, Dream of Fair to middling Women,
has been welcomed by Beckett scholars. There was a ripple of excitement when
the actor Barry McGovern read extracts from it last week at its launch in
The Dublin Writers' Museum.
It is published in Ireland with a print run of 8,000 by The Black Cat Press,
a small Dublin-based company, founded by a cardiologist and Beckett-expert,
Eoin O'Brien, who is also the novel's co-editor. Eoin O'Brien is best known
in literary circles for The Beckett Country, a collection of photographs and
texts illustrating the Irish origins of Beckett's work.
He was chosen as co-editor of the novel by Beckett's literary executor,
Jerome Lindon, and worked closely with Edith Fournier, a lifelong friend of
Beckett and sometimes his translator. Beckett had strong misgivings about
all his early, pre-war works. O'Brien says that the decision to publish
Dream of Fair to middling Women was not taken lightly, but its appearance
today 'is at Samuel Beckett's own behest, expressed to me in talks on the
subject between 1975 and 1989.' Samuel Beckett died in late 1989.
Beckett's English language publisher, John Calder, licensed this one
hardcover edition to The Black Cat Press, chiefly so that the editor could,
says Calder, 'bring out a very special edition according to his own
specifications.' Calder will be distributing the book for Black Cat in the
UK.
The 'special edition' is at first glance a rather plain 241-page hardback in
a dark green jacket; its specialness lies in the quality of its typesetting
and proof-reading, both formidable tasks as Beckett uses idiosyncrasies of
punctuation and spacing and writes in at least seven known languages; he
also coins neologisms at a rate exceeded only by James Joyce in Finnegans
Wake. 'Verbal exuberance' is a recurring phrase in critical assessments of
the work.
In fact, the non-specialist dipping into Dream could quite easily suspect
that it is an undiscovered work by Joyce. And yet, while it is undoubtedly
under his influence, the 26-year-old Beckett often prefigures the mature
writer: 'Doubt, Despair and Scrounging, shall I hitch my bath chair to the
greatest of these?' Lines from the poetry fly by; Belacqua is the main
character, as in More Pricks than Kicks, and the location is Beckett's
Dublin. At times it reads like the footnotes from Watt.
And these are more than echoes. Beckett called this useful outpuring 'the
chest into which I threw my wild thoughts,' a chest which he later
plundered, seeing no immediate prospect of the novel as it stood gaining
publication. Some of the stories from Dream were assembled with others and
published as More Pricks than Kicks. O'Brien claims that it also served as a
starting point for later works such as Happy Days and Krapp's Last Tape.
Eoin O'Brien believes that the book will have an appeal beyond the coterie
of specialists, pointing to Dream's 'youthful zest,' which he hopes will
attract younger readers. John Calder sees it as a clever student
showing-off, great fun to read, and very much a young man's book. Some of it
is very funny, some of it is quite rude. It is a book without much in the
way of restraint, whereas later on he became very restrained.
James Knowlson, Director of the Beckett International Foundation at Reading
University, and Beckett's official biographer, is among those who welcome
the publication of this early work, while admitting that it is uneven: 'Very
brilliant in parts, and not so good in other parts.'
Like many first novels, even the great master's is to some extent
autobiographical, with thinly disguised portraits of friends and
acquaintances. Knowlson thinks that he can identify most of them; all will
be revealed in two years' time when the biography appears. Meanwhile stand
by for a barrage of speculation and learned commentary when Dream of Fair to
middling Women becomes available in the UK later this month (about November
10, price Pounds 18.99).

JOSIAH WEDGWOOD
by Robin Reilly
Macmillan Pounds 20.00, 412 pages
JOSIAH Wedgwood was not only at ease with himself and captivated by his job
in life - to make and sell pots - but also confident of his destiny and
certain of his success. He relished his wife, delighted in her pregnancies,
and viewed his growing brood with immense satisfaction. He knew how to make
friends as well as pots: Richard Bentley, Joseph Wright, Joseph Priestley,
John Flaxman, Erasmus Darwin, Matthew Boulton, Tom Byerly, and many more.
Of course, he did not escape blows of fate: the terrible trouble with his
leg, which had to be amputated; the terrifying fear of bankruptcy which,
from time to time, haunted the early years of capital-intensive expansion;
the perplexing dilemmas of the revolt of the American colonies and the
French Revolution; and, in old age, the growing certainty that his children
were unlikely to live up to his expectations. They became ladies and
gentlemen, not potters.
Yet, even at the worst of times Wedgwood glowed with optimism; his eupeptic
charactor reasserted itself with ease and hope was his second nature.
Combined with his exuberant character were exceptional skills - he was an
administrator of originality, a dedicated and persistent inventor, an
advertiser of genius, and an incomparable letter-writer. He enjoyed so
seductive a personality that he burst through the constraints of class as
easily as Dr Johnson.
Surely there can be few better subjects for a biographer? He found no
Boswell during his life, no GO Trevelyan as did Macaulay - only Eliza
Meteyard. Her two volumes in 1865-6 were lengthy and just short of
verbosity, adulatory almost to the point of absurdity, and partially blind
to the world in which Wedgwood succeeded. Nevertheless, her work remains
Wedgwood's major biography.
Oddly enough, Wedgwood created a difficult biographical problem. His letters
to Richard Bentley, his invaluable partner and his key to the world of
fashion and sophistication, are as splendid in their way as Boswell's or
Horace Walpole's. They are as good as those of any 18th century writer,
glowing with a rare intensity because Wedgwood was keenly aware of his own
ignorance and just as keen to abolish it.
Bentley gave him a sense of security and of a world beyond his ken. Bentley
guided him in religion, politics and the aims of society. At the same time,
Bentley was a man of considerable taste, at home in the arts but with a
sharp sense of what might sell. Indeed, they fitted each other like a lock
and key. Letters such as Wedgwood's to Bentley are very rare - indeed,
almost non-existent: articulate manufacturers are far rarer than four-leaf
clovers. So, there is always a problem for any would-be biographer: to avoid
relying too much on them. To some extent, Reilly avoids this trap, but not
entirely: the 11 years of Bentley's friendship dominate his book.
Wedgwood's life cannot, of course, be written in strict chronological order
if one is to evaluate properly his influence on England's developing economy
or to assess how revolutionary or not were his methods and inventions. How
far was he a pioneer of consumerism? Did his concern with technology, from
canals to thermometers, energise by their example the Industrial Revolution?
Reilly's solution of the problem is to interweave themes and chronology
sensibly enough, although sometimes it makes the book very uneven.
Except when dealing with purely ceramic matters, and the relationship
between Wedgwood and other Staffordshire potters or family matters, Reilly
is insecure. His better chapters - like that on Competition and the Market,
or The Lunatics and Other Enlightened Friends - are depend fundamentally on
others.
For the first, he draws heavily on Neil McKendrick's work of 25 years ago
although, given half a chance, he will rap McKendrick's knuckles for factual
errors from which he himself is far from immune. He is more generous to
Robert Schofield, whose work on the Lunar Society is the basis of the other.
Some chapters are very thin.
Unfortunately, too, Reilly does not possess a facile pen; his style is
wooden and his prose leaden. Nevertheless, I recommend you to read this
book. In it, you will recognise so much of a world you might have thought
alien to our own.

   BIOGRAPHY: Master Sgt. Samuel Kanyon Doe led a bloody coup April
12, 1980, that ended the rule of President William Tolbert, who was
killed.
   Doe's presidency has been characterized by numerous coup
attempts, murders and detentions of opposition leaders and
suppression of the country's press.
   Doe permitted elections in October 1985. When opposition parties
appeared to have won the voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed
ballots. The election commission Doe had appointed declared him the
winner.
   The election rigging triggered the worst violence yet under
Doe's rule. At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died,
including Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led a coup attempt.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989,
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.

COLERIDGE EARLY VISIONS BY RICHARD HOLMES (VIKING: $19.95; 409 PP.,

Literaria' (George Allen &amp; Unwin), is visiting associate professor of

<TEXT>
<P>
Reading Richard Holmes' award-winning biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge felt 
something like meeting face-to-face a person with whom I have worked 
long-distance for years. Here he is, with all of his faults and all of his wit, 
all of his astounding intellectual power, and above all with his richly 
engaging personality: Coleridge -- the great Romantic poet and literary critic, 
the theologian, the political theorist. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes plays his hand openly: He has written a courageous and tough-minded 
book. As he points out, "No biographer, since James Dyke Campbell in 1894, has 
tried to examine (Coleridge's) entire life in a broad and sympathetic manner, 
and to ask the one vital question: What made Coleridge -- for all his 
extravagant panoply of faults -- such an extraordinary man, such an 
extraordinary mind? The most radical thing about the present book -- the first 
of two volumes -- is simply that it is a defence of Coleridge in these terms." 
</P>
<P>
Offhand, that may not seem so radical, but in our times as in his own, 
Coleridge has provoked both hyperbolic praise and bitter condemnation. In this 
context, Holmes' work is indeed radical because he does not blink at 
Coleridge's faults, and yet he values both Coleridge's character and his 
achievements fairly. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Holmes has had to bridge gulfs of several sorts. Because Coleridge's 
interests and achievements were so broad, "Coleridgeans" easily divide into 
hostile camps: the literary theorists, the critics, the epistemologists, the 
theologians, the political theorists. Coleridge's personal life also invites 
sharply divided opinion: Lies, debts, drugs, plagiarism must be balanced 
against wit, generosity, genius and suffering. Given this situation, 
intelligent moderation can be a daring act -- and one that also requires 
considerable scholarship. I came away warmly impressed both with Holmes' 
personal integrity and with his scholarly judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' balanced yet sympathetic portrait rests upon a consistent narrative 
unity. He does not use biography as an excuse to string together analyses of 
major works. Nor is he trying to psychoanalyze Coleridge. I particularly 
admired the balance and insight of his accounts of Coleridge's early 
experiences because the primary documentary evidence often is so contradictory. 
For instance, all his life Coleridge elicited extravagant praise; in 
particular, he made an incredible first impression on others. Too often, this 
exaggerated praise collapsed into an equally exaggerated censure. Coleridge's 
discerning empathy, his verbal wit, his capacity for self-parody and, above 
all, his prodigious intelligence ought to have impressed anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Coleridge was always eager for approval; he was centrally, agonizingly 
insecure -- a pair of problems that he himself linked to the early death of his 
fond, approving father and to his mother's remarkable coldness. Having elicited 
the attention and approval he needed, Coleridge then had to cope with meeting 
expectations that would have intimidated far more confident men. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes maps out this pattern in well-documented detail but never uses depth 
psychology to explain it away. Instead, he uses the pattern to generate a 
lively dramatic tension: How talented is this chap anyhow? Will he make 
anything of himself? And if so, what? Is he going to make it as a poet? Or 
should he stick with the political journalism that has been so well-received? 
And is this German stuff yet another escape, or will it lead to something? 
</P>
<P>
The only personal or dramatic balance that Holmes misses, it seems to me, 
concerns Coleridge's opium use. Although duly noting Coleridge's arthritis and 
his recurrent bouts with rheumatic fever (in which severe joint pain is the 
most prominent symptom), Holmes at first seems to dismiss Coleridge's 
subsequent malaise in damp winter weather as some version of Seasonal Affective 
Disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes does not point out that Coleridge's pattern of opium use more nearly 
matches that found in people who take narcotics for legitimate reasons: When 
his symptoms subsided with warmer and dryer weather, he could decrease his dose 
with far fewer consequences than true addicts experience. Especially when 
rheumatic valve damage turned to congestive heart failure, Coleridge's mix of 
physical and psychological motives for taking opium became extraordinarily 
complex: the use of the word addict oversimplifies. Holmes does not explore 
these motives with the subtlety that I admire at other points in this book. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Holmes is bold and discerning in his portrait of Coleridge's work, 
including the plagiarism problem. In the disappointments of 1799, Holmes can 
"glimpse something new stirring in that extraordinarily flexible and 
resourceful mind: the hope of creating himself imaginatively out of the sense 
of failure itself." He contends that, for Coleridge, "the subject of failure, 
of lost imaginative power, could itself produce great poetry, vividly imagined 
and metaphysically argued." 
</P>
<P>
This very central argument probably will have a parallel in the next volume of 
this two-volume biography: that the failure of Coleridge's formal philosophic 
ambitions itself produced a philosophic theology and a literary criticism of 
extraordinary power and influence. Holmes' argument about Coleridge's 
significance is radical because Coleridge has been damned for his "inability" 
to propose an old-fashioned, closed, strictly logical philosophical system. Or, 
just as obtusely, Coleridge's philosophic and theological work has been written 
off as a disaster that smothered a fine poet. Holmes adeptly transcends these 
usual categories. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' work thus complements the massive re-evaluation that has slowly been 
built upon new or modern editions of Coleridge's writings -- especially the 
"Notebooks." This biography promises to integrate Coleridge's career as nothing 
else ever has, and thus to provide one basis for interrelating Coleridge's work 
in diverse disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleridge: Early Visions" will prove widely influential because Holmes' 
portrait is so accurate, so fully imagined, so wonderfully engaging in its own 
right. I'm ordering copies of this volume as gifts for friends who have heard 
me tell Coleridge stories for 20 years. Here: Someone for you to meet.

<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Adams by Ernest Samuels (The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: 
$25; 504 pages). 
</P>
<P>
"Porcupinus Angeliscus," Secretary of State John Hay called Henry Adams, his 
gossip, walking companion, close friend, and co-owner of the double mansion 
across from the White House which stands today as the Hay-Adams Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The fox knows many things; the porcupine knows one thing well," Sir Isaiah 
Berlin wrote. All his long life -- 1838 to 1918 -- Adams bore a porcupine's 
head upon a fox's skibbling legs. They trotted him restlessly from mastery to 
mastery without ever staying long enough to move in. 
</P>
<P>
Classical historian, philosopher of history, political insider, novelist, 
professor, muckraking editor, conversationalist, husband, grand Platonic 
(though unwillingly) lover, epicure, puritan and, for a year, a fastidious 
South Seas drifter: Adams was all these things, many of them with brilliance. 
Yet they all eluded him or, more accurately, he eluded all of them. When his 
brother, Charles Francis Adams Jr., asked his help in preparing a biography of 
their father, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Make any use of me that you like just as though I were real." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth in a line of famous Adamses -- John, John Quincy, Charles Francis -- 
Henry angrily struggled with the family curse of being so high-minded as to 
reach a summit and then drift off upwards. He ran all the races, and well 
enough to win; but because he could not allow himself to want the prize, he 
never quite ran any race at all. 
</P>
<P>
Except one, and that one without running. He wrote some of the most 
extraordinary sentences in American letters. His genius was a series of 
specific and powerful brilliancies that glitter in his best books and 
particularly in his collected letters. He was a master miniaturist who 
attempted murals and got lost. 
</P>
<P>
Even "The Education of Henry Adams," which carries along wonderfully for 
awhile, sinks struggling into its own quicksand of high-reaching and 
half-articulated thought. William James wrote Adams to commend the early parts 
of the book. But, he added cautiously, "a great deal of the later diplomatic 
history is dealt with so much by hint and implication that to an ignoramus like 
W. J. it reads obscurely." 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Samuels, who had spent his life on Adams' life, makes a spectacular 
effort to assay and describe the cloudy convolutions of such speculative works 
as "Mount Saint Michel and Chartres," and of Adams's theories on history. 
Sometimes, as with a long and devoted marriage, the features of Samuels' 
writing come to resemble those of its subject, both in its witty pinpointing 
and in its clouds. But even he tells us finally -- and it reflects Adams's own 
unsleeping self-awareness: 
</P>
<P>
"Adams could not either state his problem or wholly know what he himself 
meant." 
</P>
<P>
Samuels' three-volume biography was powerful and artful scrutiny of the man who 
doubted he was real. It is a classic, but three volumes in this case may itself 
constitute a kind of practical unreality. Now the biographer has condensed and 
refined his work into one volume, benefitting from additional material that has 
come to light. 
</P>
<P>
It starts off, appropriately, with a high-minded refusal. As a child, Henry 
observed his grandfather, John Quincy, declining to attend a Boston banquet for 
President Tyler. It was a protest against Tyler's slave-holding; even more, it 
was a slap in the face of the Boston financial Establishment for its 
complaisance towards slave-holding interests. 
</P>
<P>
Always a virtuous remnant, the Adamses were never at ease even in the city that 
most of us associate them with. Henry could not even abide its virtues -- nor 
ever quite get away from them. He called Boston "a provincial city in which 
intellectual life has foundered in moral earnestness." All his life he worked, 
not really successfully, to strip himself of what he called "my Bostonianism 
and finikin clinging to what I think best." When Harvard tried to give him an 
honorary doctorate, he wriggled and temporized and introduced so many caveats 
before refusing, that finally President Charles Elliot wrote stiffly reminding 
him that "You are not conferring the degree on yourself -- it is the act of the 
University." 
</P>
<P>
It epitomized his brilliant, hopeless, comical and rather grand pursuit of a 
three-legged contradiction: to be an Adams, to make a mark on a brawling, 
vulgar United States, and to infuse this cigar-chewing, money-grubbing, 
immensely vital country with the spiritual and cultural values of European 
civilization. It made him alternately reach out and pull back, whether as a 
Washington insider-outsider or as a celebrator of old-world sophistication and 
political dialectic. He managed to be an aesthete on close terms with the likes 
of Bernard Berenson, to be a parlor Marxist, and to be a genteel conspirator 
for Cuban independence. "Come and revolute Cuba," he wrote to Hay -- not yet in 
the government -- at one point. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, his salon was a privileged window on national politics. Everyone 
came by to tell him things. At the same time, along with his wife, Clover -- 
until she killed herself in an access of depression -- Mr. and Mrs. Hay, and 
several others of the elect, he set standards for snobbishness. Even President 
Rutherford Hays found himself snubbed one day when he walked over to join Henry 
and several of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels' volume gets in all in, along with Adams's travels, his writings, and 
the long unconsummated love affair, after his wife's death, with Elizabeth 
Cameron, another Washington grande dame. She sent him away, called him back, 
she would and she wouldn't. Finally, she didn't. Possibly this was to his 
relief; he wrote her with melancholy wit: "I am not old enough to be your tame 
cat. You are too old to accept me in any other character." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps wit -- melancholy, choleric, exhilarated -- was, after all, his true 
passion and bedrock reality. Certainly his letters, from which Samuels quotes 
generously and well, demonstrate it. This one-volume compression calls urgently 
for another: a selection of letters from Harvard University Press's six-volume 
set.

<HEAD>The Best Books in English</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So many books in the world. So what shall we read?
   Three British bookmen and 15 collaborators have produced a list
of 2,500 books they consider are the best in the English language.
   ``That's a lot of titles, but if you start young enough, we
think you could get through it. You could read a book a week if you
wanted to,'' said Brian Last, one of the three editors of ``An
English Library'' from Gower Publishing Co.
   Their book contains 15 categories of books, from fiction to
reference, and cites 11 books of the Bible in the Old Testament and
seven in the New Testament.
   Charles Dickens' novels and William Shakespeare's plays mingle
with the poems of the present poet laureate of England, Ted Hughes,
and modern American novels such as Ken Kesey's ``One Flew over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
   The new book is based on ``An English Library'' by the late
Frank Seymour Smith, a librarian whose choice ran to more than
5,000 books in 1963, none of them by a living author.
   ``Our changes take account of more modern tastes,'' said Last in
an interview. ``We wanted to remodel Smith, put in contemporary
writers and add new sections like world literature in English which
takes account of important authors in Australia, Canada, India and
Africa.''
   Last, 39, is managing editor of Scholar Press, a Gower
subsidiary. He and co-editors Nigel Farrow, 50, chairman of Gower,
and Vernon Pratt, a researcher at Lancaster University who is in
his 40s, say they compiled their list with the single aim of
extending people's enjoyment of reading.
   ``We all write, teach or publish books for a living but read
them for enjoyment,'' Farrow said.
   ``At the end of the day there is always the worry that we might
have left out something important but we have done as much
painstaking research as we could,'' Last said. ``We tried to
include everything that is first rate of its kind.''
   Smith put asterisks against his personal choices in what he
called the ``exhilarating wealth of genius in English books.''
   The editors of the new edition have not done the same but at the
request of The Associated Press, Last and Farrow (Pratt was
unavailable) selected their top books in each category. Here they
are, with the original publication dates:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ English and American Fiction: Charles Dickens, ``Little
Dorrit'' 1855-57. F. Scott Fitzgerald, ``The Great Gatsby'' 1925.
   _ World literature in English: the poems of Wole Soyinka, 1960s
onwards.
   _ Children's literature: Lewis Carroll, ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland'' 1865.
   _ Poetry: William Butler Yeats, 1890s onwards.
   _ Drama: William Shakespeare, ``King Lear'' 1605.
   _ Biography: James Boswell, ``The Life of Samuel Johnson'' 1791.
   _ Autobiography: Robert Graves, ``Goodbye to All That'' 1929.
   _ Essays and other prose writings: George Orwell, ``Inside the
Whale'' 1940.
   _ Travel: Freya Stark, ``The Journey's Echo'' 1964.
   _ Literary criticism: Samuel Johnson, ``The Lives of the Poets''
1781.
   _ History: David Thomson, ``Europe Since Napoleon'' 1957.
   _ Philosophy: John Stuart Mill, ``On Liberty'' 1859.
   _ The Bible: The Old Testament Book of the Prophet Isaiah. About
the 8th century B.C.
   _ Fine arts: E.H. Gombrich, ``The Story of Art'' 1950.
   _ Reference: ``The Oxford Companion to English Literature,'' 5th
edition edited by Margaret Drabble. 1985.

<TEXT>
   ``There was some argument over the American novel, and `Gatsby'
was challenged by `Huckleberry Finn' (Mark Twain),'' said Last.
   ``There was a problem with the poetry as we felt that (Geoffrey)
Chaucer, (Philip) Larkin, (Thomas) Hardy and (Andrew) Marvell had a
right to the top spot but we agreed that Yeats had the edge.
   ``It was enormously difficult to choose a play of Shakespeare as
all his plays should really be there, and on another day we might
have picked `Othello.'''
   The editors' final advice: ``If you don't like something, don't
plow through it. Reading isn't competition, it's enjoyment. The
classic you don't like is in our book because it is a classic.''
   ``An English Library'' costs $25.50. It is available in the
United States from Barbara Church at Gower Publishing, Old Post
Road, Brookfield, Vt. 05036.

<HEAD>Captured Liberian Leader Survived Many Coup Attempts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Liberia, Bjt
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberian President Samuel K. Doe took power in a violent coup a
decade ago and left power in the same manner.
   His capture Sunday by fighters loyal to rebel leader Prince
Johnson comes 8{ months after insurgents began their battle to
unseat him. The civil war has claimed more than 5,000 lives and
re-opened the ethnic divisions that Doe used to take power.
   Sixty-four people, including many of Doe's bodyguards, were
killed in the battle Sunday, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
Doe was reported wounded in both legs. The fight took place outside
the headquarters of the West African task force sent to end the
country's civil war.
   Doe claimed he had thwarted 30 attempts to topple him since
April 12, 1980, when he led a band of 17 sergeants who ended
domination of this West African nation by the descendants of freed
American slaves.
   Doe, son of an army private, personally led the charge into the
executive mansion of President William Tolbert, who was killed. The
sergeants publicly executed 13 other prominent Americo-Liberians
several days later.
   Born in blood, Doe's rule was characterized by numerous murders
and detentions of opposition leaders and suppression of the
country's press.
   In August 1981 he had five of his closest associates shot for
allegedly planning a coup against him. Later a president guard
commander was executed in similar circumstances.
   After more than five years of military rule Doe permitted
elections in 1985. The election rules Doe had approved required
presidential candidates to be at least 35 years old.
   His official biography listed his birthdate as May 6, 1952. The
year was scratched out, 1950 written in, and the biography handed
out to reporters.
   When opposition parties appeared to have won the Oct. 15, 1985
voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed ballots. The election
commission Doe had appointed declared him the winner.
   On Nov. 12, 1985, another former close associate, a sergeant who
like Doe had been named a general after the revolution, attacked
Monrovia. His men took over local radio stations and appeared to
control the city before Doe counterattacked.
   At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died. Brig. Gen.
Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led the coup attempt, reportedly was
disemboweled after being captured.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   Doe, in announcing he would not seek another term as president,
said he has survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be happy to
leave the ``burden of leading a country ... the political
harassment'' to someone else.
   The former master sergeant, described by foes as impulsive and
by friends as brave, visited the scene of a bloody assault by his
own troops on refugees in Monrovia. He met with victims and
promised to help them, and vowed to executed the masked soldiers
who had committed the attack.
   ``Remember that tough times don't last, only tough people do,''
Doe once said at a news conference.
   By all economic standards the country has declined sharply since
Doe took power. But it was already broke when he arrived. It had
huge budget deficit and a foreign debt of $800 million.
   The goal of his revolution had largely been simply to end the
rule of the elite descendants of American slaves. He also wanted
better pay and conditions for soldiers.
   Doe worked hard, taking college classes, speech tutoring, and
shifting from army fatigues to a three-piece suit.
   Since July, Doe had been holed up in his mansion as street
fighting raged in the capital. His troops _ many of them members of
his Krahn tribe _ reportedly refused to let him flee without
obtaining assurances for their own safety.
   The rebels have accused Doe of nepotism and stealing millions of
dollars of state money. They also hold him responsible for the
deaths of thousands of civilians killed during the civil war.

<HEAD>Johnson's Widow Says Criticism of LBJ Would Anger Her, If She Read

<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Lady Bird Johnson said Tuesday that some of
the things written about her husband would make her angry if she
read them, so ``the simplest thing is not to read them.''
   That was the closest the former first lady, meeting with
reporters before a speech winding up a Johnson administration
reunion, came to commenting on the furor over Robert Caro's ``Means
of Ascent.''
   The book, the second volume of a projected multi-volume
biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, has been sharply criticized by
Johnson associates and some reviewers who say it is unduly harsh on
the 36th president.
   Caro defends his research and says a more positive picture of
Johnson's achievements will emerge in later volumes.
   Mrs. Johnson, asked simply whether ``negative'' books and other
writings about her late husband made her angry, replied, ``I'm sure
they would if I read them, so the simplest thing is not to read
them.''
   The former first lady was interviewed in the front parlor of the
Woman's National Democratic Club, with pictures of herself and
other presidential wives on the wall. Visible through a window was
a garden she dedicated during the Johnsons' White House years.
   Mrs. Johnson was in Washington for a series of events in
connection with the 25th anniversary of Johnson's inauguration as
an elected president in 1965.
   In her speech, the widow of the man who was president from 1963
to 1969 dealt mainly with her work on behalf of beautification and
the environment, both while in the White House and since leaving it.
   Mrs. Johnson told reporters the reunion has been fun, although
``neither my eyes nor my legs are as strong as they once were.''
   She said she wouldn't want to be back in the White House, though.
   ``It's too much of a crescendo of activity, and when you are 77,
you want to lie in the hammock and savor the world.''

   Armand Hammer loves biographies. 

   The industrialist, art collector and self-appointed diplomat has written or commissioned no fewer than four books about himself, with a fifth in the works. 

   But Dr. Hammer's affection for literary introspection screeches to a halt when it comes to the work of a bespectacled journalism instructor who has spent nearly five years assembling the first unauthorized Hammer biography. 

   So perturbed is Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s venerable chairman by "Armand Hammer: The Untold Story" that he's trying to scuttle the book's planned publication this month by Time Warner Inc.'s Little, Brown &amp; Co. subsidiary. 
Lawyers for the 91-year-old executive complain it's "riddled" with scandalous falsehoods distressing to the doctor and his family. 
The lawyers have threatened to file suit in the U.S. and have already taken the first steps toward filing a suit in Britain. 

   Dr. Hammer declined through a spokesman to discuss his objections to the book, but the prospect of a rumble over the biography has hands rubbing in the book world, where controversy equals sales. 
Author Connie Bruck's timely inside look last year at junk-bond king Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. jumped to the best-seller list after the brokerage house fought bitterly with the author. 
Salmon Rushdie's nearly impenetrable "Satanic Verses" took off only after the Ayatollah Khomeni's death threats. 

   Speaking generally, "as a publisher, we're delighted when someone attacks our books," says Peter Osnos, associate publisher at Random House Inc., the division of Advanced Publications Inc. whose Ebury Press Ltd. subsidiary holds the British rights to the unauthorized biography of Dr. Hammer."It's the modern-day equivalent of being banned in Boston." 

   Steve Weinberg, the book's author, maintains that Dr. Hammer's dilemma isn't truth but ego. 
"He has spent so much time building his image and wanting to be remembered in a certain way that now he's troubled by cracks appearing because of the book," he says, maintaining that every detail in his densely footnoted work has been checked for accuracy. 

   While in many ways an admiring portrait, Mr. Weinberg's book looks at much that Dr. Hammer covered up or glossed over in his most recent, best-selling autobiography, published in 1987. 
It explores a questionable bankruptcy filing by Dr. Hammer's father, which a court-appointed official suggested was fraudulent. 
It finds that the doctor failed to mention plans to visit post-revolutionary Russia when applying for a passport in the early 1920s and recounts scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State Department of the doctor's early travels to that nation. 

   Moreover, Mr. Weinberg, who teaches investigative journalism at the University of Missouri, has unearthed documents indicating that although Dr. Hammer's insights on East-West relations are generally listened to, he has scarcely been the valued confidant of State Department officials and presidents as he has portrayed. 
Once he was even publicly ridiculed by Franklin Roosevelt, according to the book. 

   Letters by Dr. Hammer's lawyers, sent to Little Brown this summer and obtained by The Wall Street Journal, complain that the biography "is beyond redemption by correction," containing dozens of passages implying that Dr. Hammer "is and has been throughout his life unscrupulous and willing to attain personal goals and ambitions through criminal act, breaches of fiduciary duty or other unconscionable behavior." 

   Dr. Hammer's British lawyer, in a letter to Ebury Press, goes further, charging that "it is difficult to envisage a more despicable attack upon a gentleman who, throughout his long life, has done so much for his country and so much in the interests of health care and world peace." 

   Counters Mr. Weinberg, "the objections in the letters are both ludicrous and defamatory." 

   Such are the battles of unauthorized biography these days, in a market hungry for inside dope on the rich and famous. 
Authors and their subjects have squabbled for years; Oscar Wilde's advice to the famous was to outlive their biographers. 
Most lawsuits don't inhibit properly researched biographies in this country, although libel laws in England and elsewhere make opposition easier overseas. 

   According to the 41-year-old Mr. Weinberg, his decision to play Boswell to Dr. Hammer's reluctant Johnson came about almost by accident in 1984, when a friend considered and then discarded the idea of a biography of Dr. Hammer. 

   Though Mr. Weinberg wasn't aware of it at the time, Dr. Hammer soon knew all about his project. 
According to Dr. Hammer's lawyers, he had gotten the details from a copy of the publishing proposal, one that Mr. Weinberg angrily says Dr. Hammer wasn't entitled to have. 

   Little Brown beat out five competitors for the publishing rights, agreeing to pay a $160,000 advance for the book. 
And, starting in 1986, Mr. Weinberg wrote seven letters to Dr. Hammer asking for interviews. 

   Dr. Hammer never responded. 
Senior executives at Occidental avoided Mr. Weinberg's calls. 
Even the company's top spokesman, Frank Ashley, refused to return any of the 20 or so calls Mr. Weinberg made. 

   Though locked out of the company, Mr. Weinberg began contacting more than 1,000 people who had once worked for Dr. Hammer or otherwise knew him. 
About 700 agreed to talk. 

   Dr. Hammer's apparent displeasure with the unauthorized biography hung like a pall over the project. 
The Soviet government informed Mr. Weinberg, through its U.S.A. and Canada Institute of the Academy of Sciences, that is wasn't interested in aiding his research. 
Advice columnist Abigail Van Buren, a longtime friend of Dr. Hammer, agreed at first to meet with Mr. Weinberg but changed her mind after talking to one of Dr. Hammer's lawyers. 

   But others did talk, including Ms. Van Buren's twin sister, Ann Landers, and publisher Malcolm Forbes. 
Both spoke of Dr. Hammer in laudatory terms. 

   Countering the official silence from Dr. Hammer, Mr. Weinberg dug into dozens of cases of personal and commercial litigation, government investigations, divorces, property transactions and correspondence that have marked Dr. Hammer's long and active life. 
To add breadth to the search, he hired researchers from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv and studied documents originally written in a dozen languages, including Chinese and Estonian. 

   The letters by Dr. Hammer's lawyers arrived soon after the book was set in type, apparently based on a reading of a review copy. 
Copies of the letters were sent not only to Little Brown but also to J. Richard Munro, Nicholas J. Nicholas and Steven Ross, the top executives of Time Warner. 

   So far, the saber-rattling hasn't halted publication in the U.S.; Little Brown is distributing 50,000 copies to bookstores. 
In England, Ebury Press, facing preliminary steps of litigation, had agreed to wait at least until the end of last month before proceeding.

BIOGRAPHY: IN HIS SECOND VOLUME ON THE FORMER PRESIDENT, AUTHOR ROBERT CARO 
TAKES A BLEAK VIEW OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S LIFE FROM 1941 TO 1948 . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Everything about Lyndon Baines Johnson was outsized. His physical bulk, his 
energy, his ambition, his tirades, his deceptions and even his ears made 
Johnson a political mega-force. 
</P>
<P>
No less forceful is the work of Robert Caro. The former newspaper reporter has 
labored for 14 years to turn the life of Johnson into what will be a 
four-volume biography that, he says, will tell the darkness-and-light tale of 
how a poor boy from the lonely Hill Country of Texas acquired power in 
Congress, became a millionaire, clawed his way to the U.S. Senate in a "stolen" 
election, ascended with alacrity to become Senate Majority Leader and twisted 
arms as President to turn his civil rights initiatives into law. 
</P>
<P>
Caro's L.B.J. in the newly published second volume, "Means of Ascent" (Alfred 
A. Knopf), is unrelentingly dark. There is none of the 
Johnson-as-the-boy-wonder depicted in the first volume, the young congressman 
who brought electricity to the 200,000 farmers and ranchers of his rural 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The L.B.J. in "Means of Ascent" angrily stalks through the bleakest wilderness 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Johnson, the second volume of Caro's opus is ambitious and 
compelling. Even Horace Busby, a longtime Johnson adviser, who disagrees with 
Caro's savage evocation of the period, says: "My feeling is he's making the man 
a legend. Carl Sandburg would have to write another book about Lincoln to keep 
up with Caro." 
</P>
<P>
Knopf has dispatched 250,000 copies of "Means of Ascent" across the country, up 
from the original 200,000 first printing. The book is a main selection of the 
Book-of-the-Month-Club and six excerpts of it have appeared in the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Caro has spent seven years on each of his books: "Means of Ascent," "The Path 
to Power," which earned Caro the National Book Critics Circle award for 
nonfiction and "The Power Broker," Caro's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of 
New York's master-builder, Robert Moses. He has also spent part of the past 14 
years on a novel about the newspaper business, which he left in 1967. All he 
will say of it is that "it is immense." 
</P>
<P>
Working with his wife, Ina, a medieval historian and his research assistant, 
Caro has spent months at a time in Texas, reading some of the 34 million papers 
in the Johnson Library in Austin and driving rented cars thousands of miles 
across the state for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, Caro wants to be where Johnson was, to visualize what molded his 
subject, much as Francis Parkman, the historian Caro admires most, did when 
writing about the American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
When Caro didn't comprehend Johnson's upbringing in the lonely Hill Country and 
residents didn't trust that the city boy with the New York accent was committed 
to knowing them, he and Ina moved near them for parts of three years. He gained 
their trust and their unembellished memories. 
</P>
<P>
When he wanted to understand the area's loneliness, he took a sleeping bag and 
camped out on a ranch for four days, waiting as Lyndon and his brother, Sam, 
once waited for a car to come by so they'd have somebody to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 years of studying his subject at the Johnson Library, 787 document boxes 
filled with notes, memoranda, letters, telephone transcripts and speeches -- 
altogether about 629,000 pages of documents, have been delivered to Caro in the 
eighth-floor research room. 
</P>
<P>
Caro says he has dug deeper and wider than any biographer (there have been 21 
others) to understand Johnson. "Everything in this book," Caro says, "is true 
and documented beyond the possibility of any doubt. That's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
What Caro covers in "Means of Ascent" is a seven-year period in Johnson's life, 
from 1941 to 1948, when the future President saw his way blocked to power in 
the House of Representatives and election to the Senate. He had lost a special 
1941 Senate election and reluctantly stayed out of the 1942 race, to follow 
through on a promise to fight in "the trenches" if war brought out. 
</P>
<P>
He was no longer the pet of House Speaker Sam Rayburn or a President's southern 
protege after Franklin Roosevelt's death in 1945. He craved influence and 
money, but had neither. As he eyed the 1948 Senate election, Caro writes, it 
was "all or nothing." If Johnson lost, he'd return to a life he dreaded, to 
being ordinary and poor, like his daddy. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson of Caro's uncompromising portrait of these years "is unrelieved by 
redeeming social values," says Robert Gottlieb, the editor of the New Yorker, 
who has edited all of Caro's books for Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a picture corroborated by Johnson confidants like John Connally and 
Horace Busby -- who admit they can't fault Caro's reporting, just his 
conclusions. Connally, former governor of Texas and secretary of the treasury, 
says: "For whatever reason, Caro has painted the dark side of Johnson without 
the benefit of the doubt on anything. Why I don't know. But the problem in 
arguing with Caro is it's impossible to dispute his facts. I don't argue the 
facts, but the nuances and interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
Caro shakes his head at Connally's remarks. Connally refused to speak to Caro 
until two years after the publication of "The Path to Power." Says Caro: "My 
interviews with him were four days of the most fascinating interviews I've ever 
had. When we started talking, he was enthusiastic about the book. But since he 
started his own book, that enthusiasm has lessened. He told me the reason he 
talked to me was because I had gotten Johnson 'right on the head' and he didn't 
want me to write any more volumes without him." 
</P>
<P>
Says Busby: "I'm not detracting from his work, but Johnson was a many-sided man 
who was difficult to capture. Caro doesn't deal with the extreme sensitivity of 
the man, and I was closer to that side of him than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
From the start of his work, Caro's goal has been to separate legend from truth 
by speaking to people never interviewed before and pressing others to 
reconstruct events as they happened. Among the parts of the Johnson legend Caro 
disassembles: 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson's war service. After a desultory 10 weeks of inspecting shipyards for 
the Navy, a period enlivened only by parties and practical jokes, and after 
Roosevelt rebuffed him for high-level Washington desk jobs, Roosevelt sent 
Johnson to the Southwest Pacific to survey the war effort. While Johnson 
maintained that he played an important combat role, he was only an observer on 
a bomber that saw 13 minutes of action against Japanese Zero fighters. Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur awarded him the Silver Star. Back home, L.B.J. had the Silver 
Star pinned on him at public appearances, and became the increasingly heroic 
"Raider" Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson's wealth. As President, Johnson maintained that the broadcasting 
empire that started with buying the KTBC radio station in Austin in 1943 was 
built by Lady Bird. He had nothing to do with it. But Caro shows that it was 
Johnson's influence with the FCC that helped buy the station, change it to 
full-day operation and shift it to a better frequency. It was Lyndon who won a 
CBS radio affiliation for KTBC, unavailable to a rival Austin station. It was 
Lyndon to whom influence-seeking local lawyers and businessmen came with open 
pockets to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
Caro intended "Means of Ascent" to carry Johnson up to John F. Kennedy's 
assassination in 1963, but he stopped in 1948, the year of Johnson's "stolen" 
victory in a Senate primary runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The primary campaign matched Johnson, running as if for his life, and Coke 
Stevenson, the stoic former three-term governor who never made promises or 
presented a campaign platform. Stevenson won the primary by 71,000 votes, but 
it wasn't enough to avoid a run-off. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is why material that began as one chapter turned into 
two-thirds of Caro's book. 
</P>
<P>
"If I showed the 1948 campaign in depth, I could show things I've always wanted 
to show about American politics," says Caro. "I could show the full 
destructiveness of the new media politics on the political process. In Coke 
Stevenson, you had the old politics in a pure example. It was the end of an 
era; no one ever campaigned like this again in Texas. And here is Lyndon 
Johnson with his new politics and media manipulation. He didn't create the new 
politics, but he brought it to a new maturity." 
</P>
<P>
That the run-off was stolen is not disputed. But Caro disproves the myth that 
the votes filched in Johnson's name represented business as usual in Texas 
politics and that everybody did it -- even Coke Stevenson. Caro found that no 
race had ever witnessed a vote theft so massive, where thousands of votes 
shifted to Johnson for six days after balloting closed. Johnson's puny 87-vote 
margin of victory was contrived when the corrupt Rio Grande Valley political 
boss, George Parr, ordered Luis Salas, an election judge in Jim Wells County, 
to add 200 votes for Johnson. "If the votes were not for Johnson, "I make them 
for Johnson," Salas later said. 
</P>
<P>
Caro does not say Johnson directed the vote thefts. But he does not believe 
denials that L.B.J. lacked personal knowledge of what was being done in his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years, people didn't know what happened," says Caro, "and I said I 
wasn't going to write a biography of Lyndon Johnson where in the pivotal point 
in his career, I'm not going to know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not the election that tantalized Caro as much as Coke Stevenson, the 
symbol of the end of the old ways. In Stevenson, Caro found the perfect 
antithesis to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Caro wasn't prepared for Stevenson; he had barely heard of him until people who 
knew Johnson told stories of the cowboy governor's honesty. In the capital of 
Austin, Stevenson was known as the man who could not be bought. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1948 campaign, Johnson lied about Stevenson's positions; he 
insulted, mocked and aped him. Repetition was the key. But Stevenson wouldn't 
reply. Johnson's new politics trampled Stevenson's old politics. Unlimited cash 
let Johnson pound his message over the radio airwaves. Stevenson campaigned 
simply, driving into towns, giving speeches on courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
Connally says Caro "beatified" Stevenson to set up Johnson as "the man in the 
black hat. There was no balance at all. Stevenson was an old-style politician 
who was well-regarded; he sure wasn't all that beloved." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say anything about Stevenson's integrity, did he?" asks Caro. No. 
Caro nods, certain as ever, of the rightness of his portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Caro writes in an office on West 57th Street, not far from the apartment he and 
Ina, who were married 32 years ago, share on Central Park West. His workplace 
is spare: a stained white couch, dirty walls, unwashed windows, scratched wood 
bookcases, used file cabinets and a shabby desk. 
</P>
<P>
He arrives each morning about 8, but when thoughts rouse him from his sleep, 
he'll be at his desk before sunrise. He hates distractions; when he writes, he 
shuts off the telephone and answering machine. The mail slot on his door is 
blocked with a steel plate. 
</P>
<P>
He is an exacting perfectionist who doesn't think he's taking too much time to 
study Johnson and who believes that the truth takes time. He wonders why, after 
he's set down all the facts, people could disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that while someone may quibble with me," he says, "they'd be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For all his intensity and what Gottlieb calls "his free-floating anxiety," Caro 
is unfailingly polite and respectful. It's not difficult to visualize how Caro 
induces Johnson friends and intimates like lawyer Ed Clark, a Texas power for 
40 years, and contractor George Brown of Brown &amp; Root, which helped 
bankroll Johnson's campaigns -- men who had never talked to biographers or whom 
other biographers ignored -- to open up. 
</P>
<P>
"My models for interviewing are George Smiley and George Simenon's Inspector 
Maigrit," says Caro. "What distinguishes both is their empathy, how they 
understand what they're hearing rather than ask a lot of questions. I'm always 
writing 'shut up' to myself in the note pad." 
</P>
<P>
One Caro technique is to take interviewees back to key places to help them 
recall important moments in Johnson's life. In Volume One, he took Lyndon's 
brother, Sam Houston Johnson, back to the family home to re-create the searing 
arguments between Lyndon and their father. 
</P>
<P>
Caro almost always refuses to use a tape recorder, except for rare technical 
interviews. A wooden cabinet in his office stores precisely stacked piles of 
pads, each annotated on the cover with the people interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Many more notebooks will be filled before Caro is done. He is now writing about 
Johnson's Senate years in Volume Three, covering the period when Johnson became 
the most powerful majority leader in history. This time, threads of dark and 
light run together, as Johnson uses questionable means to pass early civil 
rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"His personality doesn't change," says Caro. "All the old traits, good and bad 
are there, but he's using them in a noble cause. To watch him tirelessly 
maneuver the civil rights legislation with his savage energy is fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
"If I portray him right," adds Caro, sitting on the edge of his couch, 
excitedly describing the work that lies before him, "we will never have to ask 
again what one aspect of political genius is. This is it. That's why I raise 
the relationship between ends and means. By the time you finish my four 
volumes, anyone who wants to talk about the relationship between ends and means 
will have the material." 
</P>
<P>
Caro has been observing Senate action from its overhead gallery and examining 
papers, memos, letters and telephone transcripts of Johnson's contemporaries. 
Caro says the most revealing information comes from the papers of lesser-known 
senators. "The story of how he came to power has never been told," he says, 
"because some of the collections have never been looked at." 
</P>
<P>
Caro is bluntly confident that he will come closer than any biographer to 
knowing the man who could muscle into law both the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution 
and the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
One person who disagrees with Caro's self-assurance is UCLA history professor 
Robert Dallek. He says that he's done the historical research that will yield a 
more accurate portrait of Johnson, which he will publish in two volumes, the 
first to be published late this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Caro is a muckraking investigative journalist who does a lot of interviewing, 
and he's painted a portrait of saints and sinners, with elements of cartoon and 
caricature," he says. "I've done interviews, but mine is based on 116 
manuscript collections. My books rest on the contemporary record more than the 
memories of people about events from 30 or 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Does Robert Caro hate Lyndon Johnson? No, says Caro. "Means of Ascent' was 
meant to be dark, but it is only seven years. Lyndon Johnson is not the sum of 
his actions between 1941 and 1948. His positive impulses, manifested in rural 
electrification in the 1930s and social justice legislation of the 1960s, did 
not emerge in this period. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to know this personality," says Caro. "It may be unpleasant to know. 
His presidency was a watershed in American history. The country changed. In a 
watershed, on the top of a divide; waters on one side run in one direction and 
on the other side, they run in the other direction. That was Lyndon Johnson's 
presidency. It wasn't solely because of his personality, but if you have a long 
list of factors why history changed during his presidency, the personality of 
this President has an unusually heavy weight in the equation. You have to 
understand that."

   Robert Caro can understand why some Lyndon
Johnson supporters are unhappy with with the second of a
four-volume series on the former president's life.
   Caro also felt disappointed. ``I really thought I was going to
love him,'' said Caro, author of ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson:
Means of Ascent.''
   ``When I started on the series, I thought he was like (former
New York Gov.) Al Smith. There were great similarities. They were
both very uneducated, physically unattractive,'' said Caro, who
wrote of Smith in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Power Broker:
Robert Moses and the Fall of New York.''
   ``But Al Smith, while he was a ruthless politician, I thought
Smith's motivating drive underneath was his desire to help his
people, like the Irish immigrants,'' said Caro, who has spent 14
years studying Johnson's life. ``I had the same image of Lyndon
Johnson when I started and it was an image that died hard.''
   What Caro claims to have discovered was that Johnson was a
self-centered politician obsessed with power, willing to do
anything _ steal a U.S. Senate election, wildly exaggerate his war
record, even risk his life _ to advance himself.
   Caro's first volume, ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to
Power,'' was published in 1982 and also riled some Johnson
supporters.
   Former Johnson aide Jack Valenti has accused Caro of being
``passionately bent on destroying'' the late president's
reputation. Bob Hardesty, a Johnson speechwriter who helped him
write his memoirs, called Caro's biography dishonest.
   ``I don't think it pretends to be fair. I think it is the work
of a man with a burning, unnatural hatred for his subject,''
Hardesty said.
   Caro denied bias. He said his assertions are supported by books,
newspapers, court documents, files obtained from the Johnson
Library and by interviews with Johnson's widow, Lady Bird, and
others.
   ``Means of Ascent,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf, begins with
Johnson's narrow defeat for the U.S. Senate in 1941 and ends in
1948 when Johnson beat former Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson by 87 votes
in a Senate race long suspected of having been stolen.
   Caro said that ballot boxes were stuffed and votes altered.
   ``I really believe that no fair-minded person can ever doubt
again that the election was stolen,'' Caro insisted, ``and not with
87 votes or 200 votes, but with thousands of votes. It was not
simply something that everybody did, this went further.
   ``The amazing thing to me is that there was doubt for so many
years. When you start reading the court transcripts, witness after
witness testifies the same way.''
   Caro also said that Johnson portrayed himself as ``a war-scarred
veteran of many battles on many fronts,'' but actually saw combat
in the South Pacific only as an observer and ``for a total of 13
minutes.''
   He wrote of a man who frequently humiliated Lady Bird, had a
lengthy affair with a publisher's wife and campaigned despite
potentially life-threatening kidney stones that caused fever and
excruciating pain.
   Caro agreed with his critics that his subject comes across
unfavorably, but said he felt compassion for him, referring to
Johnson's painful experiences growing up when his family was in
poverty.
   ``I tell you there are times when you really do feel like
crying,'' Caro said.
   Caro said more positive qualities that Johnson displayed as a
senator and then as president will be depicted in upcoming volumes.
   ``A Johnson person might say, `What is this? Where is the rest
of Lyndon Johnson?' The third volume, when he's passing civil
rights legislation, takes hundreds of pages and you really see him
doing something noble.
   ``He had those elements in him, great gifts. An empathy for
really the disadvantaged in society and a matchless gift for
mobilizing the powers of government.''

<HEAD>LBJ Admirers Gather for Reunion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angered by a new book picturing Lyndon B.
Johnson as a self-centered politician obsessed with power, admirers
of the 36th president are gathering here this week to celebrate his
``large and generous vision of America.''
   The occasion is a reunion recalling the 25th anniversary of
Johnson's inauguration as an elected president on Jan. 20, 1965.
   On Tuesday, a new 30-minute documentary film,``Lyndon Baines
Johnson: A Remembrance,'' was previewed at the Motion Picture
Association of America theater.
   Produced by Academy Award-winning documentary maker Charles
Guggenheim of Washington, the film presents an image of Johnson
hardly recognizable to readers of ``Means of Ascent,'' the second
volume of Robert Caro's LBJ biography.
   The book portrays Johnson in his youth as willing to do almost
anything to satisfy an all-consuming political ambition. Caro has
said a subsequent volume will show more positive qualities that
Johnson displayed as senator and president.
   The film, made up of black and white still photographs and the
voices of former Johnson associates, concentrates on Johnson's
labors on behalf of civil rights legislation and touches briefly on
the troubles that the war in Vietnam brought to his administration.
   It ends with journalist Bill Moyers, who was one of Johnson's
press secretaries, saying, ``He was many things: proud, sensitive,
impulsive, flamboyant, sentimental, earthy, mean at times, bold,
euphoric, insecure, magnanimous, but temperamental, melancholy, and
strangely ill at ease. He has such a large and generous vision of
America in his best moments as a prosperous, caring, just society.
This was a mind not given to rest, and neither, I think he would
say, should we.''
   On Friday, organizers say approximately 1,000 former White House
staffers, ambassadors, telephone operators and others from the
Johnson White House will gather for a social event to launch a
book, ``LBJ: The White House Years,'' by Harry J. Middleton,
director of the Johnson presidential library, with photographs by
the late White House photographer Yoichi Okamoto.
   ``I find it far more skillful and I think useful than Mr.
Caro's,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America and a former Johnson aide.
   Joseph Califano, a Johnson aide who later became secretary of
health, education and welfare in the Carter administration, asked
to comment on Caro's book, said of Johnson: ``Was he a tough
politician? Sure he was. Could he be a bare-knuckles fighter? Sure.
Were no holds barred? Absolutely. But what is totally missing from
Caro's book is any sense of what drove the man _ of the vision that
he had.''
   The observance is scheduled to wind up Saturday with panels of
journalists discussing ``In Search of LBJ'' under auspices of the
National Press Foundation and the LBJ Foundation, and former
Johnson administration officials discussing ``Social Welfare Issues
from the 1960s to the 1990s.''
   Many of the same group will gather May 5 in Texas for a two-day
seminar at the LBJ Ranch near Johnson City, Texas.

<HEAD>Historian: Johnson Didn't Steal Election; Others Did</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyndon Johnson didn't steal the
1948 Senate election, as a recent biography contends, but a
political boss might have rigged the election to get Johnson's
opponent, says a close Johnson associate.
   Joe B. Frantz, now a history professor, contends the election
was stolen for Johnson, possibly without his knowledge, by a
disgruntled south Texas political boss eager to derail the
opponent, Coke Stevenson.
   Johnson won the election by 87 votes out of almost a million
cast, collecting 99 percent of the south Texas vote.
   ``There's no question the election was stolen,'' Frantz said,
but he contends that political boss George Parr filched it to spite
Stevenson, not necessarily to help Johnson.
   Frantz said he revealed the information at a recent historical
society banquet because of accusations against Johnson by Robert A.
Caro in ``Means of Ascent,'' the second volume in Caro's biography
of Johnson.
   Frantz, a White House aide under Johson and former chairman of
the University of Texas history department, teaches at Corpus
Christi State University.
   Frantz put together the Oral History Project for the Johnson
Presidential Library in Austin, taping interviews with nearly 1,000
people, including Johnson's political enemies.
   He said his information about Parr's political vendetta against
Stevenson came from an interview he conducted with Stevenson when
the former governor was in his 80s. Stevenson died in 1975 at age
87.
   ``It would have been in the early 1970s,'' Frantz told The
Associated Press. ``He set me down and he said, `I'm going to give
you the straight story' ...''
   Stevenson and Parr had always been close allies, Stevenson told
Frantz, until Parr asked Stevenson, then governor, to name a
certain man judge at Laredo.
   Stevenson refused because ``the fellow was an absolute rascal
and into evey sort of political sin available,'' Frantz said.
   Parr promised revenge, the professor said.
   ``The feeling is that Parr decided, `I'm going to teach Coke
Stevenson a lesson and, at the same time, get in very good with the
new senator from Texas,''' Frantz said.
   Frantz was unable to locate Parr to interview him before Parr
died in the mid-1970s.
   Frantz said he interviewed the man responsible for disposing of
votes from a contested box before a recount could be held.
   He said he came away from the encounter convinced the south
Texans were guilty of stuffing the box, which disappeared after the
count, with illegal votes.
   ``They were a bunch of rascals,'' he said.
   Frantz said he thought Caro's characterization of Johnson in his
first volume, ``The Path to Power,'' was slanted against his
subject.
   He said that he felt that in the second book Caro expressed
annoyance ``as if Johnson had pulled off the dirtiest steal in
history. He doesn't see things in the context of the times.''
   ``We didn't know what a secret ballot was,'' Frantz said. ``I
grew up in Weatherford, and all the precincts used to vote in the
same room in the courthouse and all the courthouse hangers-on would
stand around and watch you.''
   It was not at all unusual for campaigners to know how a vote was
going before balloting ended, he said, and for people to round up
votes midway through the voting to counteract trends.
   ``I was sort of amused by Robert Caro's almost innocence in how
dirty all this was,'' said Frantz, former director of the Texas
State Historical Association. ``When the national press seized on
it, it's like he expected some sort of local paradox down here.
Actually it's no dirtier than anywhere else.''

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: BIOGRAPHER STRUCK GOLD ON GOLDWYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the start of the 9 years he spent researching and writing about the life of 
legendary Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn, biographer A. Scott Berg was given 
access to an old storage vault in the heart of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For a biographer, Berg told his audience at a book and author luncheon in Costa 
Mesa on Wednesday, opening the door to 60 years' worth of Goldwyn's papers and 
memorabilia was like an archeologist stumbling upon King Tut's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
"As I walked into this tomb, this musty fur vault, I saw nothing but wonderful 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heaped upon dozens of steel file cabinets were reels and reels of old films and 
hundreds of thousands of photographs from Goldywn's films and personal albums, 
which Berg mined for his book, "Goldwyn: A Biography." 
</P>
<P>
Opening file drawers, Berg discovered a telegram from writer Lillian Hellman 
during the blacklist days, thanking Goldwyn for his "very strong position in 
standing up to the rest of the people in town." There were gin rummy IOUs from 
Harpo Marx and a letter from Ronald Coleman shortly after the advent of talking 
pictures, in which the golden-throated actor pleaded: "Please, Mr. Goldwyn, 
don't put me into any talking pictures -- not with my voice." 
</P>
<P>
There was even a menu book kept by Mrs. Goldwyn, in which, after each Hollywood 
party she hosted, she logged what Gary Cooper and other stars ate and drank. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said Berg, "is a biographer's dream, to find this kind of day-to-day 
stuff, the real minutiae that made their lives different from our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a sold-out crowd of 740 gathered in the ballroom of the Red Lion 
Inn for The Times Orange County Edition's second annual Book and Author 
Luncheon, Berg, who spent 2 years sifting through the Goldwyn vault, proved to 
be as gifted a storyteller in person as he is on the printed page. (He was 
joined on the speakers' dais by novelist Amy Tan, whose first novel, "The Joy 
Luck Club," is a national best seller, and Maureen Reagan, who discussed her 
memoir, "First Father, First Daughter.") 
</P>
<P>
In describing the near decade it took him to write his Goldwyn biography, Berg 
said that early on he remembered an important bit of advice he received at 
Princeton from Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker: "People die, papers don't." 
</P>
<P>
Berg, who won a National Book Award for his biography of editor Maxwell Perkins 
a decade ago, said that upon seeing the wealth of Goldwyn documents available 
in the vault, "I remembered these papers are not going to go anywhere. If I 
really want to do this book I should start getting to people who knew Mr. 
Goldwyn himself." 
</P>
<P>
He acted none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first calls was made to Goldwyn star Merle Oberon, who told him to 
call her after the Christmas holidays. She died on Thanksgiving day. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be ghoulish, Berg said, but he made a list of all the people he wanted 
to interview, and he put them in the order of age -- and health. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sad to say about 60 of the 250 people I interviewed for my book are 
now dead," he said. "But I'm very happy to say, there they are: I talked to 
them. I got their stories. They are in my book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been most reminded of it this week with the passing of Lucille Ball, who 
became a great friend of this book primarily because her first job in Hollywood 
was as a Goldwyn Girl. And how lucky I was to be able to sit down with this 
Goldwyn Girl and have her tell me what it was like getting on the train in 1932 
(and coming to Hollywood). . . . Great stories for me to take down." 
</P>
<P>
Berg said he spent about 2 years conducting interviews for the book. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, he learned much about Sam Goldwyn, including the fact that when 
Goldwyn, a former glove maker, "jumped into the movie business," the first 
person he went to talk to was Thomas Edison. 
</P>
<P>
And the last phone call Sam Goldwyn received, according to his papers, was from 
Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, that is the history of the movies right there," said Berg. "My God! 
It's all in one place; it's in one life. And I can tell that story." 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, Berg said, he discovered that Samuel Goldwyn really did say 
"Goldwynisms," those "famous fracturings of the English language." 
</P>
<P>
"He did say, I'm happy to report, 'Include me out,' " said Berg, adding that he 
also discovered that half of the so-called Goldwynisms were actually the work 
of Hollywood wags. 
</P>
<P>
"But sure enough," Berg said, "he did say to Danny Kaye, 'Anyone who goes to a 
psychiatrist should have his head examined.' " 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  THE COMPELLING CONTRADICTIONS OF LBJ  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   IN 1964, I campaigned door-to-door for Lyndon Johnson as a 14-year-old Young
Democrat.;   At 18, I could barely say his name without swearing.;   At 22, I
stood in the freezing cold on the Capitol steps for the chance to pay my last
respects before his coffin.;   Before or since, I've never had such mixed
emotions about a president, and watching the two-part, four-hour "LBJ," which
begins tonight on PBS's "American Experience," brought them all back up again:
the hope, the hate, the hurt about what might have been.;   For Lyndon Johnson
was the last president many of us believed. He was also the first we learned
had lied to us.;   He was, as narrator David McCullough says here, like
something out of Shakespeare, a dozen characters in one who rose out of the
'60s like a colossus. His triumph was achieving more on the domestic front
than anyone but Franklin Roosevelt. His tragedy was the Vietnam War, which
overshadowed all he accomplished.;   Biographer Robert Caro, in his two
massive volumes, found in LBJ a black heart, and said he came to the Senate in
a stolen election.;   Black, white, in between; Robert Dallek, whose "Lone
Star Rising, Lyndon Johnson and his Times: 1908-1960" was published earlier
this year, found in him many more shades of gray.;   "LBJ" writer, producer,
director David Grubin, whose other work includes "Marshall, Texas" and
installments of Bill Moyers' "Creativity" and "A Walk Through the 20th
Century," sides with Dallek, who is interviewed throughout the series, while
Caro is nowhere to be found.;   Neither are several other folks such as
Moyers, the former Johnson press secretary who wants to do his own work on LBJ
someday; former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, who won't talk about the
Vietnam War; and former Sen. Barry Goldwater, loser to Johnson in the 1964
election, who remains outspoken about his foe's dishonesty.;   And nowhere is
there even a mention of Eugene McCarthy, whose seemingly hopeless challenge to
Johnson in 1968 helped bring an end to his presidency.;   The only time in
"LBJ" when we see McCarthy is in the background at a John Kennedy speech at
the 1960 convention in Los Angeles.;   Such an omission is quite glaring,
considering how thorough much of the rest of this evenhanded documentary is.
Grubin spent five years interviewing more than 200 people and poring through
4,000 miles of archival film to put together his absorbing finished product.; 
 Other voices; In addition to Dallek, we hear repeatedly from other Johnson
biographers such as Doris Kearns and Ronnie Dugger. John Connally and J.J.
Pickle are among the longtime Johnson political allies who spin wonderful
tales about their larger-than-life friend.;   Bobby Baker, who went to prison
for misuse of the power he got while working for Johnson in the Senate, heads
the long list of aides on camera, while other notables include Lady Bird
Johnson, Dean Rusk, George Ball, Sargent Shriver, Clark Clifford and Daniel
Ellsberg.;   Ellsberg, who would later leak the Pentagon Papers, went to work
in the Defense Department two days after the first incident in the Tonkin
Gulf, the trumped-up event that Johnson used to get a congressional mandate to
bomb, and later fight a full-scale war in, Vietnam.;   Despite that massive
deception -- and there is clear testimony here that Johnson knew he was lying
to Congress about the alleged attack -- Ellsberg surprisingly says that, at
one point in White House discussions about the war, he felt that Johnson "was
the only sane man at that level of government.";   That was early in the war,
however, before LBJ fell victim to the generals' siren song, ignoring those
who said escalation would only drag the country into a hopeless quagmire.;  
The reason he did that, Dugger says, is that he thought he "might just get
away with it.";   He didn't, and it meant the end of what he worked so hard to
build.;   The domestic successes; "LBJ," which is divided into four segments,
is at its best when it chronicles Johnson's whirlwind domestic accomplishments
and his inability to understand how rioting could occur after all he had done
for blacks.;   But they weren't the only ones he tried to help. He started
Medicare and the Job Corps, Head Start, the school-lunch program, public
television, highway beautification and the National Endowment for the Arts.;  
In short, he was not only, as Grubin describes him, "the last believer" in the
Vietnam War but perhaps the last believer in the power of government as well.;
  No matter what his other failings were -- and they are spelled out in detail
here -- Lyndon Johnson felt the United States could do better, that it could
be a great society, and he tried his best to make that happen. That alone
makes him different from the presidents who followed.;   "He was," Ronnie
Dugger concludes, "just interesting as hell. He was just fun to be around, and
you liked him. . . . I liked him when I was with him -- more than when I was
thinking about him.";   After four hours of "LBJ," you may not like him, but
you will think about him.  </TEXT>

RICHARD EDER: UNDER THE TREE OF LIFE -- IT'S SUPERMAC ; 
</P>
<P>
HAROLD MACMILLAN VOL. 2. 1957-1986 BY ALISTAIR HORNE (VIKING; $24.95; 741 PP., 
ILLUSTRATED; 0-670-82980-3)

<TEXT>
<P>
He would like to be prime minister like his grandfather, young Alexander 
Macmillan once announced, "and sit under a tree and read a book." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Macmillan, who started in his family's publishing firm and went back 
after a 40-year detour through British politics, never really left his books 
behind. In his periodic depressions -- "black dogs" he called them -- he would 
turn the government over to Rab Butler, his deputy, and go to the country for a 
couple of days to read Jane Austen. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life, as Alistair Horne's haunting biography shows, this clever 
and sufficiently ruthless politician drew courage, high spirits, images and a 
self-image from his reading. Power, which expends so many other people as it is 
exercised, expends the exerciser most of all. The loneliness demands 
replenishment. Macmillan found company in his books, and resonance. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, for example, his recreational delight was in the prime-ministerial duty 
of keeping an eye on Britain's state religion. He would receive the Archbishop 
of Canterbury and remark, afterwards, that whereas he, Macmillan, wanted to 
talk religion, the archbishop wanted to talk politics. For a moment, he was not 
the expansive leader of a shrinking empire, but Trollope in Barset. 
</P>
<P>
Horne's biography is a superbly detailed account of the career of one of the 
more active and intelligent British leaders of the century. This second volume, 
which begins in 1957 when Macmillan took over from Anthony Eden after the Suez 
disaster, covers his seven years in office and the long and extraordinarily 
fruitful retirement that ended with his death in 1986 at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
The book has its awkwardnesses. The need to cover, at least cursorily, the 
range of problems that confronted the prime minister month by month and year by 
year makes for choppiness. There are a few pages on the Middle East, on Cyprus, 
on NATO, on weapons, on the Russians; and a new round a year or two later. It's 
like tugging a body stocking up a well-fleshed body -- a nip here, a nip there. 
</P>
<P>
Its unique virtue is not the thorough record and analysis of the public life. 
Emerging from the account of victories and defeats constructed upon the backs 
of events, and the unmanageable procession of "nexts" that wear out any public 
career, we get a portrait of the character that conducted the life. 
</P>
<P>
I say "character" rather than "man," and "conducted" rather than "lived." The 
man remains elusive, as Horne himself declares, despite his unparalleled 
access: Macmillan's unpublished diaries and correspondence, and years of taped 
and untaped conversation. 
</P>
<P>
What we get is a literary character extracted by two remarkable authors. There 
is Macmillan's account of himself: sensitive and unsparing at the same time, 
and colored by art; and Horne's: enthralled and detached at the same time, and 
also colored by art. On a lesser scale, of course, but still -- Johnson by 
Boswell. To speak of a literary character is not to contest its truth. The tree 
Macmillan read books under was his tree of life. 
</P>
<P>
The public image that lingers of him is buoyancy followed by droop. In the 
first years of his government there was a kind of euphoric resurgence in the 
country. The Beatles and Carnaby Street were icons of trendiness; there was a 
renaissance in the arts and the beginnings of a tourist boom; and the economy 
seemed to be perking up. 
</P>
<P>
"You never had it so good" -- a campaign slogan -- almost seemed true. Abroad, 
the jaunty figure of "Supermac" in a white fur hat, trying to revive summitry 
with an explosive Khrushchev, or speaking of the "winds of change" in Africa, 
or knitting a comrade-in-arms tie with Eisenhower and an avuncular tie with 
Kennedy, contributed to the brightness. 
</P>
<P>
It was on a curve of decline, though. Macmillan was only one of a procession of 
British leaders to wrestle unsuccessfully with sluggish domestic productivity 
and energetic domestic consumption. Despite his passion to keep Britain as one 
of the world's Big Three, Macmillan had to accept the shrinking of his 
country's role in the world, a partnership with the United States that owed 
more to personal relations than to reality, and De Gaulle's crushing veto of 
Britain's entry into the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
It was these things more than the Profumo affair -- a sex scandal that erupted 
around a cabinet minister John Profumo -- that brought Macmillan low and 
discouraged him out of office. Without waiting for more considered medical 
advice, he decided that a prostate operation he was undergoing would 
incapacitate him permanently, and quit. He spent 23 years of subsequent good 
health regretting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Regret can destroy a public man. For a man of letters, on the other hand, it 
can open a world. Macmillan took an active guiding role in the affairs of what 
was then his family's publishing house. More than that, though, his voice was 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
As chancellor of Oxford University, he turned a ceremonial post into a podium 
for a cycle of spacious, witty and beautifully turned observations on the 
affairs of the world, present and past. The same golden words electrified the 
House of Lords when, at 90, he finally accepted the earldom that Queen 
Elizabeth had kept on open offer for the previous two decades. They astonished 
visitors, and in a series of letters and visits over the years, they provided 
solace to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of his friend. 
</P>
<P>
Filtered through his conversations with Horne, they turn an accomplished 
political biography into something much richer. It is a mosaic of vivid 
recollections, pungent comments on events and personages, and splendid 
observations by friends, old antagonists and the biographer. There was a 
quality in Macmillan's wit, as in Falstaff's, that encouraged the wit that was 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyant and suspicious, effervescent and depressed, capable of cutting irony 
and real personal and social compassion, Macmillan was an actor who wrote his 
own lines (with the help of Sophocles, Machiavelli, Burke, Lucretius, Conrad 
and Hardy, among many others). Harold Wilson, a fierce opponent and 
not-so-secret admirer, said that "his role as a poseur was itself a pose." 
</P>
<P>
Horne shows the poses. Macmillan did the effete Etonian snob to perfection; 
also the bookish gentleman with slipping eyeglasses, a stained cardigan and a 
Guards Regiment tie just showing. At 85, he was particularly good at suggesting 
senile collapse and then rising to deliver a stunning hour of elegance and 
passion. In office, he won the loyalty of his gifted subordinates by 
pronouncing all crises to be "fun" or "a bore," and by making a point of never 
coming in until late in the morning. He explained: 
</P>
<P>
"If you come to the Cabinet Room at 9:30 and start ringing bells you only upset 
them all . . . if you come down too early it's rather like an office too; all 
the work piles up, and you must let them have time to open the new letters, the 
urgent ones, the urgent telegrams, otherwise you become rather a nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
One can imagine an audience of executive overachievers ("He's always at his 
desk by seven, long before his secretaries," the publicity bio goes) listening 
to such advice. One hopes they might. It is the kind of thing that explains how 
this long-retired political in-fighter, statesman and besotted reader was able, 
in his ninth decade, to make his listeners feel wiser and more hopeful. It 
makes us feel that way too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Harold Macmillan, Volume II: 1956-1986." 
</P>
<P>
After John F. Kennedy's death, a deep affection grew up between his widow and 
the man who had been her husband's ally, friend, adviser and fellow-wit. When 
he was alive, Macmillan and Jacqueline Onassis would see each other whenever 
either was in the other's country. The extracts from letters between the two 
that appear in this book -- mostly unpublished up to now -- give a rare and 
moving glimpse of Mrs. Onassis' feelings and her ability to express them. 
</P>
<P>
Here, she replied to Macmillan's initial letter of condolence: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I become so bitter, only alone -- I don't tell anyone -- but I do 
truly think that any poor school child looking at the record of the 1960s -- 
could only decide that virtue is UNrewarded. The two greatest men of our time, 
you and Jack -- all you fought for and cared about together -- the Atlantic 
Alliance -- how full of charity were your relations always with each other even 
when unforeseen disastrous things like Skybolt happened. And how does it all 
turn out? De Gaulle is there (words deleted) and bitter old Adenauer -- and the 
two people who have had to suffer are you and Jack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And then I remember this summer -- when we lost our son Patrick -- and he 
showed me the letter from you -- in your own hand -- and you said -- in the 
midst of all your troubles -- 'Private griefs are so much worse than public 
ones' -- you were in the most terrible time of your life -- but you could write 
that way to Jack . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And here is the last part of Macmillan's reply: 
</P>
<P>
"I shall count it something I can perhaps do for Jack, just being a recipient 
of letters . . . I am writing this at home -- in this softly beautiful day, 
with the buds on the trees in the woods, just beginning to get that wonderful 
purple before the Spring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"May God bless you, my dear child. You have shown the most wonderful courage to 
the bitter outer world. The hard thing is really to feel it inside. . . ."

FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Biographer and historian - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The writer Sir Peter Quennell died on Wednesday at the age of 88.
The news will be heard with sadness by all who value purity and elegance of
expression in literature. Quennell was one of those for whom an ugly
sentence could cause more pain than an aching tooth.
He was a regular contributor to the Financial Times' weekly books page over
many decades. An eminent biographer himself, he was a natural choice to
review the lives of those famous or obscure authors who inhabit the highways
and byways of 18th and 19th century literature. His own extended
pen-portraits of Byron, Boswell, Baudelaire, Hogarth, Ruskin and others may
still be read with enjoyment.
But Quennell's link with the FT was stronger than that of an occasional
contributor. He was for many years joint-editor of the journal History Today
when it was part of the FT's stable of periodical publications, and he
worked from an office within the FT in Bracken House.
Quennell and his colleague, Alan Hodge, his co-editor, used to make a
striking contrast when they appeared together in the lift, the former tall
and matinee-idol-like in appearance, the latter with the anxious countenance
and concentration of a scholar. They were firm friends, however, and through
Hodge, who had served Brendan Bracken and Churchill, kept alive the spirit
of an illustrious past.
The then chairman of the FT, Lord Drogheda, was in the habit of sending
queries down about recondite literary topics to 'Peter Q' (as he always
called him) and receiving an instant response.
Born in 1905, Quennell was the son of C H B Quennell, the architect, and
Marjorie Quennell, a book-illustrator. The pair published jointly a number
of reference books of which A History of Everyday Things is the best known.
They sent Quennell to Berkhamsted Grammar School where he was a contemporary
of Graham Greene but, far from scarring him for life, it seems to have
equipped him with most of the resources required, not merely for success in
literature, but also socially.
In his youth no fashionable gathering was complete without Quennell's
handsome witty presence. He crops up with alarming frequency in the smart
memoirs of the period.
Quennell showed distinct promise as a poet in his youth, but then found his
true metier in biography and literary journalism. He reviewed for a variety
of journals with a long spell as chief book critic of the Daily Mail and he
was editor of The Cornhill Magazine in the 1940s.
Quennell had five wives and two children, a daughter Sarah and a son
Alexander, both of whom survive him. He was knighted in 1992.
Quennell was a delightful companion with an unexpected gift for mimicry, and
he will be much missed by his many friends, both for his conviviality and
for his lightly worn erudition.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Private View: The taming of a lion of literature - Stephen
Spender, a living monument of English letters, is 85 next week. He describes
how his idealism has made a compromise with life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1930s - Berlin, Spain, socialism and homosexual love - defined him. The
1990s have enshrined him, a relic of his age, the surviving limb of the
poetic quadruped that Roy Campbell called MacSpaunday - MacNeice, Spender,
Auden and Day-Lewis.
What happened in between? Stephen Spender, 85-years-old on Monday and with a
rare volume of new poems to mark the event, says that somewhere around the
middle of his life he became domesticated.
'I think I got so much involved in things largely to do with earning money
and supporting my family,' he said. 'I can't look back on my last 40 years
as a kind of legendary, private, personal thing.'
Do you mean you've been too successful for a poet? Too suburban?
'Yes, very bourgeois. Too much so, I think. And I regret that, very much. I
wasn't when I was young, because I went to Spain during the civil war and
lived with a friend of mine, a working-class friend.' (He means the youth he
called Jimmy Younger in his 1951 autobiography).
'And I don't go to pubs. I often think my life would be much richer if
anyhow I'd gone to pubs all the time.'
Why do you say that?
'Because I think this a very limited existence and a limited view of
existence. One has to realise that self-interest is a very high priority:
one's standard of living becomes a very high priority, you see. But that is
all to do with family . . . Then friends have been very important.'
The young idealist who used to talk of 'going over to the proletariat' has
lived in a rented villa in fashionable St John's Wood, London, since 1945.
The house is painted blue, inside and out. There he lives with his second
wife (his first marriage was brief), Natasha Litvin, a Russian pianist. They
have a son who paints and a daughter who writes: she is married to the
female impersonator Barry Humphries, which makes Spender Dame Edna Everage's
father-in-law.
I asked him if the bourgeois life had been bad for his writing.
'My writing would probably be different. I don't think it's really bad for
my writing. I mean, I think in a way my poetry is all one long poem. And I
think - I hope - that it's moved outwards from being about myself,
discovering my own identity, partly into discovering other people's and
partly about the historic period we've lived in. That's extremely important,
isn't it?
'There's something very unreal about middle-class life today. You can sit
eating a lamb cutlet and you have television on and you see a child in Asia
somewhere starving to death in front of one's eyes, or people being
murdered.
'What do you do? Do you stop eating the lamb chop, do you turn off the
television?' He laughed, tickled by the dilemma. 'I think you somehow have
to go on . . . facing the lamb chop and thinking, well, this is my life.'
He has written about the dreadful events of his century, but thinks a writer
cannot enter in too far. 'I mean, the real experience today is the 10
seconds before someone is murdered, in the concentration camps or something
like that. The reality of our time is of consciousness participating in its
own extinction, being destroyed, you see, in some terrible way.'
Poets, he said, had always been aware of moments in which poetry disappeared
into 'a terrible reality beyond itself.' It was what King Lear was about,
and why Dr Johnson couldn't read it. 'Johnson wanted to stay this side where
there is literature. I'm very conscious of doing that.'
Spender shows signs of the classic complex of the too-comfortable,
silver-spoon socialist. But he has not been entirely passive. Not only did
he go to Spain, he instigated Index on Censorship in response to a plea from
the Russian dissident Pavel Litvinov.
You have a CBE, I said accusingly, and a knighthood.
'My son was very upset when I accepted. I said all my friends have been made
knights - Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, though not Francis Bacon who
refused everything.
'What I'd really like is to be known to have refused a knighthood. I'd like
there to be an honours list with in the left-hand column the honours and the
right-hand column those who refused.' He giggled, and I saw the cheeky
Oxford undergraduate behind the old-ladyish face. 'It's just vanity,
absolute vanity.'
Are you going to tell me the best thing about a knighthood is being able to
get a table in a restaurant?
'That's exactly what was on my lips.' He laughed delightedly.
Spender seems gentle, naive and vulnerable. He is a lot tougher than he
looks. I mentioned his string of appointments, especially in the US, and
asked: Have you helped create your own worldly success?
'No I'm sure I haven't. No, I've never sought out anything. I really
haven't' But later, only half-jokingly, he said: 'There's a sort of danger
if you don't see your name in the newspaper you think you no longer exist.'
How do you react to being lionised?
'I suppose one does in a way. The answer is one quite likes to make an
entry, you see. On the other hand I am very glad that in England so little
is made of all that.'
Is it one of the recompenses of the writer's life that people come up to
you?
'I like that. I always wanted that. When I was a child I always longed to be
famous. Yes, I did really.'
He described a recent 'scraggy meeting of poets' adding: 'All the younger
poets received me very sort of politely, nicely and affectionately. I think
that's fun, in old age, if one gets a little affection and people are at all
grateful and respect you. You don't feel you've altogether deserved it, but
you think 'Thank God I've managed to escape universal contempt.' Don't you
think?'
As a poet, Spender has not been prolific - he has written essays, reviews,
journals, autobiography and fiction - and some critics say he has written
only a handful of great poems. His ambition from the age of 10 was to get
one piece into the Oxford Book of English Verse. He hopes he will be
included in 100 years' time - but for something other than his
much-anthologised 'The Truly Great.'
Have you ever thought about your obituary?
'No, I dread all that. People are beginning to write my obituaries now.' He
laughed uneasily. 'It's all about your sex life and things like that.
'It seems rather terrible that one can't write a poem without not only one's
own life being subject to biography but the lives of unfortunate people who
have been concerned with one suddenly dragged into the light.
'Biography can become a form of pornography in fact.'
Last week Spender won an injunction to suppress the British publication of
While England Sleeps, a novel by a homosexual American writer which
fictionalised the 'Jimmy Younger' episode in Spender's own life. And his
riposte to a recent, unauthorised biography was to lodge a 40-page catalogue
of 'mistakes' in the British Library.
I said: You've written yourself about your ambivalent sex life. Did you
marry and have children in order to get away from the homosexual ghetto and
the misery you thought you might have to endure?
'Well, perhaps,' he said cautiously. 'I think that every vocation requires
some kind of gift, doesn't it? What's rather marvellous today is that there
are homosexuals who are sort of gifted for being homosexuals.'
Auden, he said, was an example of a homosexual who had no gift for it: he
really wanted to be married and would have been a wonderful father.
'I am not really happy living with another man. I just find it a strain.'
Of course in the 1930s it was sort of fashionable?
'Yes it was. It was a sort of club. And if you forsook the club they were
very annoyed. They felt very let down, especially as it was a club of people
who were taking high risks . . . Well, not high risks like Mount Everest -
more Mount Skiddaw or something.' He laughed.
Is living in the 1990s interesting for you, or a struggle?
'I think it's still interesting. Anyhow to be a survivor is to mean that you
carry something with you which is of your generation. I feel I do carry
something with me which is of my generation and of my friends.'
This sense of being part of a continuum is described in Dolphins, the new
book of poems, where Spender reflects on Samuel Pepys' diaries, and writes:
No, when I read Pepys now, he and his cronies
Burn from their days and through my veins -
Their acts and passions one with those
Moving through mine]
Is writing, I asked him, an attempt to make sense of life or a prop for
life?
'No, it's a way of trying to make sense of life, and trying to do so as
clearly as possible. I've always tried to be as clear as I possibly could.
It's also a record of experience.'
Spender recently started keeping a diary again, not only in order to keep a
grip on names and events but to recapture, as he put it, 'the feel of things
and the sensation of people, the characters.'
Even at this stage of life?
'Yes, even at this stage of life. And also I do know rather interesting
people.'
So you explain life to yourself by writing about it?
'Yes, I do.'
And you give yourself a purpose for living as well?
'Well, my purpose for living would be just to do that, I think.'
It sounds circular, I said.
'I suppose. But why not?'
And it goes on until you drop off the perch?
'I hope so, yes. I think so. It becomes all one's life, so if one stopped
one would drop off the perch.'
Do you still suffer from youthful idealism?
'Yes, I think so, yes.'
But idealism is about the future. At 85 what kind of idealism can one have?
'At 85,' he said immediately, 'I think one should express no public opinions
because they may involve something such as you'd be prepared to die for -
and you're going to die for some other reason. You can't put your life on
the line any more, can you?
'I'm quite clear about that. I don't think I should express any opinions
about anything, publicly. Just try to go on writing my work, my thoughts, my
diaries.'
Aren't you supposed to be the village elder now? To sit in the sun with your
hands over the stick and provide a free consultation service for the
middle-aged who are trying to run the show?
'Yes, I know. That would be possible in the city state, like Athens, but I
don't think old people are in that position now, are they?'
What's the fun of being 85 if you can't hand down wise words?
There was a long pause. Spender was obviously working up a joke. Then he
began giggling: 'I think the fun of 85,' he said, spluttering with mirth,
'is that one won't have to live into the next century.'

<HEAD>Coleridge Biography Wins Whitbread Book Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the
British poet who wrote ``The Ancient Mariner'' and ``Kubla Khan,''
was named the Whitbread Book of the Year on Wednesday.
   Author Richard Holmes was awarded the prize and $36,300 for his
biography ``Coleridge: Early Visions.''
   The volume is the first part of a major series on Coleridge, who
was an opium addict and contemporary of William Wordsworth.
   ``The prize means basically that I will have time to write
more,'' said the former teacher after receiving the award at
Whitbread's, a brewing firm.
   Holmes's book was voted Biography of the Year by Whitbread
judges in October. Competitors for the Book of the Year were
October's winners in the categories of first novel, best novel,
poetry and children's novel.
   Last year's Book of the Year award went to ``The Comforts of
Madness,'' Paul Sayer's first novel about long-term psychiatric
hospital patients who cannot speak.

<TEXT>
   Here is a brief profile of Liberian leader Samuel K. Doe:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Samuel K. Doe was born on May 6, 1950, in Tuzon, Grand Gedeh
County.
   He attended R.E.B. Richardson Baptist Junior High School and the
Ministry of National Defense Radio and Communication School in
Monrovia.
   Doe joined the Liberian Army in 1969. As a master sergeant, he
led the bloody coup on April 12, 1980, that ended the rule of
President William Tolbert, who was killed.
   Doe's presidency has been characterized by numerous coup
attempts, murders and detentions of opposition leaders and
suppression of the country's press.
   He permitted elections in October 1985. When opposition parties
appeared to have won the voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed
ballots. The election commission Doe had appointed declared him the
winner.
   The election rigging triggered the worst violence yet under
Doe's rule. At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died,
including Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led a coup attempt.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989,
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.

<TEXT>
   "We are now ready to tackle Dickens. 
We are now ready to embrace Dickens. 
We are now ready to bask in Dickens. . . . 
With Dickens we expand." 
The speaker is Vladimir Nabokov in his lectures on "Masters of European Literature" at Cornell, known affectionately as "Dirty Lit" to the innocents of the Eisenhower age. 
At first it may seem improbable that the most vividly imperial artificer to practice in English since Joyce should praise the most popular novelist of Victorian England, indeed the most popular writer who ever lived. 
How could Nabokov, the elitist champion of High Modern Art, expostulate so warmly on behalf of the sentimental entertainer, the naive social reformer, the Father Christmas of English literature? 

   Because Nabokov's "Lolita" is perhaps the last Dickensian child: the heart of a tragicomic anatomy of culture and society. 
Because Nabokov -- like Joyce in "Ulysses," like Eliot in "The Waste Land" (which Eliot had thought to call "He Do the Police in Different Voices," a quote from "Our Mutual Friend") -- understood that Dickens's genius was for style and structures far below the melodramatic, comic or bathetic surface palpitations of his encyclopedic entertainments. 

   After the early years of our century, Dickens was taken off grandfather's shelf and reread. 
George Orwell and Edmund Wilson in the '30s and '40s, Lionel Trilling and Steven Marcus in the '50s and '60s gave us new ways to approach him. 
Today "Nicholas Nickleby" is theatrical legend, and a newly released "Little Dorritt" joins "Great Expectations," "David Copperfield" and more than a dozen others on the screen. 
Dickens is at once "Masterpiece Theatre" fodder and an academic classic -- there are Marxist, Freudian, social historical and scores of other exegetical Dickenses scampering amid footnotes and library stacks. 
He is the Shakespeare of the English novel. 

   Hence this new biography (Morrow, 607 pages, $24.95) by Fred Kaplan, whose biography of Dickens's great hero, the Victorian social critic and moralist Thomas Carlyle (dedicatee of Dickens's "Hard Times"), won much deserved praise when it appeared five years ago. 
Mr. Kaplan's life joins Edgar Johnson's 1952 biography of Dickens's "tragedy and triumph" and the highly intelligent late-19th century biography by Dickens's friend John Forster. 
It doesn't eclipse these predecessors, but it's likely to be the life for our times. 

   The quantity of new material from Dickens's letters and the attention to the minutiae of the Victorian literary business world -- which made Dickens rich -- consort easily with Mr. Kaplan's deft encapsulations of Dickens's 15 novels (his readings are psychoanalytic -- without jargon -- and sensitive to theme, image and structure). 
One finishes this large book as one finishes a long swim in Maine waters: invigorated and duly impressed by the force of the tide. 

   Charles Dickens was born in 1812 in the seaside town of Portsmouth, where his father was working as a navy payroll clerk. 
The family soon was on the move between Portsmouth, Chatham and London as the father scrambled for social status, overspent, lost his job and floundered on, announcing that "something was bound to turn up" to rescue him from ruin. 
In 1824 he finally was imprisoned for debt, and the 12-year-old Charles had to drop out of school and take a job labeling pots in a London shoe-polish factory. 

   Even after his father was released from jail, his mother saw no reason to release the boy from his humiliating confinement -- and Charles never forgave or forgot it. 
After four traumatic months in all, he was set free by his father and returned to school. 
At 15 he took a job as a law clerk and then became a court and parliamentary reporter. 
At 21 he began a series of newspaper sketches of London life and followed these "Sketches by Boz" with his early comic masterpiece, "Pickwick Papers" (1836-37). 

   He almost instantly became a celebrity and remained one until his death 34 years later. 
Dickens mirrored the age, both as "The Emperor of Cheerfulness" and, as Regency glee turned into Victorian gloom, the scourge of industrial greed, hypocrisy and self-destruction. 
While writing his novels, published in either weekly or monthly installments that eventually were bought by more than 200,000 readers, Dickens also founded an unsuccessful daily newspaper and two immensely successful weekly magazines. 
He conducted an exceptionally vigorous social life, endured an unhappy marriage with 10 children and a complex extended family, pursued an endless round of charitable enterprises, mounted private performances of amateur theatricals he often wrote himself, walked at least 10 miles a day in all weather, and made highly profitable tours of America in 1842 and 1867. 
At 46 he separated from his wife of 22 years and seems to have maintained a mistress. 
In the last nine years of his life he embarked upon a series of public readings from his novels, and he died at age 58 in 1870 of a stroke brought on by hysterical, compulsive overwork. 

   Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Mr. Kaplan's biography is its picture of Dickens's professional life and friendships: One senses anew the extraordinary competitive vigor of the Victorian imperial personality. 
Mr. Kaplan's objective presentation of the facts about the colossus of the age gives us a far better sense of its shape and scale than any facile charm might conjure up. 
His clarity is the highest form of respect and affection for his astonishing subject. 
There were indeed giants on the earth in those days.

   In her account of Erich Leinsdorf's American years (Leisure &amp; Arts, Jan. 21), Manuela Hoelterhoff omits one important name, the man who saved the anti-Nazi conductor from deportation to his native -- and, at the time, Hitlerite -- Austria. 
This was none other than Lyndon Baines Johnson, then a young congressman and protege of Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

   Robert Caro (in "The Path to Power," the first volume of his remarkable Johnson biography) records the historic moment. 
The two young (Viennese musical and Texas political) prodigies met in Washington's Mayflower Hotel at the behest of mutual friend, Alice Glass. 
There, Lyndon Johnson set wheels in motion that were to keep Leinsdorf from the tender mercies of the "Anschluss" and the Thousand Year Reich. 

   So let's hear it for LBJ. 
A standing ovation. 
And "bravissimo." 
Or, as Maestro Leinsdorf might be the first to say, "Ich liebe" Lyndon."

   Portrait of a Feminist Heroine

<LP>
   Simone de Beauvoir was an instant celebrity after the
publication of her pioneering feminist book, "The Second
Sex," in 1949. By the 1970s she was "sacred monster" to the
radical feminists whose sexual politics had supplanted hers.
She ended up a lionized if somewhat compromised figure.
Untrusting, self-absorbed, alcoholic, de Beauvoir doesn't
arouse much sympathy.
   Deirdre Bair has written a huge, heroic book that focuses
on de Beauvoir's contribution to intellectual history, though
the unflattering minutiae that fill many of its pages make de
Beauvoir look small and fallible. Ms. Bair seems predisposed
to take the optimistic view of her subject in this avowedly
"feminist" biography, "Simone de Beauvoir" (Summit, 718
pages, $24.95), even when history and her own hard research
shine a darker light.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During the five years before de Beauvoir's death in 1986
of cirrhosis, Ms. Bair, winner of the National Book Award for
her biography of Samuel Beckett, visited her at 11 rue
Schoelcher, where de Beauvoir lived alone with her books, TV,
travel collectibles, and a refrigerator which blocked the
foyer. Having flushed her morning vodka from her system, de
Beauvoir poured them each an ounce of Scotch.
   With the Montparnasse cemetery outside, they discussed her
life. De Beauvoir had told Ms. Bair she wished to be
remembered as a writer, not the feminist author of "The
Second Sex," and they considered forming a "biographical Hall
of Mirrors." When de Beauvoir died, Ms. Bair was left to her
own interpretations. The result is the woman as feminist
heroine -- the role de Beauvoir resented because it eclipsed
her other achievements.
   Working the often unheroic facts of de Beauvoir's life
into feminism's agenda is not easy. She was not, this
feminist biography notwithstanding, a woman's woman.
Threatened by intellectual female writers, she avoided them.
Lest her friends prefer one another, she prevented them from
meeting. She screened worshipful female students as partners
for her lifelong companion, Jean-Paul Sartre, apparently
seducing several first herself. In her autobiographical first
novel, about a love triangle, she kills off the rival
protagonist.
   Ms. Bair seems both to love and be appalled by her
subject. A voyeuristic prig whose unlikely pastime, in her
late teens, was masquerading as a prostitute in Paris bars,
de Beauvoir slipped past remonstrating Catholic parents to
the Sorbonne, where she performed compulsively well in
philosophy -- an unladylike department, by her mother's
standards -- and met Sartre.
   The couple got off to a great start. But soon he was
denting her thin emotional armor, swallowing handfuls of the
stimulant Corydrane as if they were vitamins and making
frenzied love to teen-agers. At one point, their world grew
so self-referential they fixated on each other's hands, with
Sartre looking on while de Beauvoir spent hours applying
garish nail polish (incongruous on a woman who wore torn
dresses and hated to wash her hair).
   In occupied Paris, despite paper rationing and censorship,
they furthered their careers. While Sartre played
buffoonishly at Resistance activity, forming an ersatz cell
as though no established movement existed, de Beauvoir
published for the first time, and from 1943 drew a weekly
paycheck from the German-run state radio. Ms. Bair handles
the charges of "moral collaboration" and "opportunism" by
adopting a strangely inappropriate language of "feelings."
They "did what they felt they needed to do in order to
survive. If they felt better about their actions by analyzing
and explaining them . . . their equivocations should probably
be judged accordingly."
   Following de Beauvoir's lead, Ms. Bair treats the genesis
and composition of "The Second Sex" sentimentally, quoting de
Beauvoir's remark about conceiving her 900-page masterwork
"almost by chance." She portrays de Beauvoir in a sober
ecstasy of research and writing, processing details of her
friends' lesbianism, Sartre's precepts, and books like "The
Kinsey Report" sent by her mostly long-distance lover Nelson
Algren. Finally, she cranked out the chapters fortified by
liquor and pep pills.
   Ms. Bair devotes much of the book's last third to the "The
Second Sex's" reception: jeers, obscene hate mail, awe,
international acclaim. De Beauvoir became public property,
like a film star, her "lopsided" relationship with Sartre in
the spotlight. In public a feminist bulwark, de Beauvoir
privately dismissed (Ms. Bair tells us in the notes) critics
of her perceived enslavement to Sartre: "I'm sorry to
disappoint all the feminists, but you can say that it's too
bad so many of them live only in theory instead of in real
life."
   The theory and reality of de Beauvoir's life were two
different matters. Born into the "belle epoque" and raised as
a spoiled bourgeois girl, she was a feminist by default: She
didn't fit well into the world of women as it existed, and
when she described her dissatisfaction she spawned a
movement. As one of its first leaders, she sometimes came up
short. And so her messy life occasionally locks the wheels of
Ms. Bair's big, sleek feminist vehicle.

THE LIFE OF GRAHAM GREENE VOLUME I: 1904-1939 BY NORMAN SHERRY (VIKING: $29.95;

<TEXT>
<P>
In securing Graham Greene's approval to write this biography, Norman Sherry 
tells us, he promised the novelist that he would retrace his arduous journeys 
through the more rugged parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Risking disease and death as he had done," he writes, ". . . I made journeys 
to Mexico (where I contracted dysentery in exactly the same mountain village, 
living in the same boarding house as he had done), Haiti, Argentina, Paraguay 
and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"In Liberia, a week after I had left that most corrupt of countries, during a 
revolution led by Sgt. Doe (now general and head of state), the previous 
corrupt leader was murdered and his supporters shot or had their throats cut. I 
had only recently interviewed some of these men." 
</P>
<P>
There is something grandiloquent and faintly absurd about this. If Sherry had 
tackled De Maupassant would he have felt obliged to contract a venereal 
disease? Does talking to government officials who were subsequently murdered 
really constitute risk of death? 
</P>
<P>
Boastfulness does not disqualify a biographer; Leon Edel is not a shrinking 
violent; neither was the late Richard Ellmann. But presumably boastfulness 
would be earned by the writer's perceptiveness and literary gifts; not by his 
blisters. The sad truth about this massive biography -- only the first of two 
volumes -- is that its energy is mainly physical. No doubt, those were hard 
trips; they seem to have done more for Sherry's self-confidence than for his 
insight, which is crude, or his writing, which is ungainly. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry's book describes Greene's comfortable but uneasy childhood as one of the 
children of the headmaster of Berkhamstead School, and later as a student 
there. It takes us through a mysterious adolescent breakdown, a course of 
treatment with a London psychoanalyst, his days at Oxford, his courtship, 
conversion and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
It tells of his life as a struggling and frequently failing young writer; and 
of the early successes -- "Stamboul Train" and "This Gun for Hire" -- which, 
sold to Hollywood, allowed his family to live with a little more ease. It goes 
on to describe the writing of "Brighton Rock," a religiously tinged thriller 
and his first masterpiece; and of his expeditions to Africa and to Mexico. It 
ends with 1939 and "The Power and the Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Greene chose Sherry, the latter tells us, partly out of admiration for a book 
he had written about Joseph Conrad. At the same time, Greene wrote a friend 
that his biographer-to-be "has the great advantage of not knowing me." 
Considering that Greene was reluctant to have a biography done at all, and only 
gave in at the urgings of relatives, the phrase has an odd ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose it is far-fetched to suggest that the elusive writer, noted for 
privacy, chose Sherry because he sensed convenient qualities of obtuseness in 
him. But it is remarkable how little, despite 12 years work and thousands of 
miles traveling, Sherry has managed to get beyond what Greene has already 
chosen to put out about himself. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's grueling trek through Liberia, for example, in the company of a young 
cousin, is vividly related. But the telling seems mainly to be a paraphrase of 
Greene's own book on the subject. The footnotes for these chapters largely 
consist of citations of "Journey Without Maps" followed by chains of 20 or 25 
ibids. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the chapters dealing with the writer's trip to Mexico draw most of 
their substance from Greene's "The Lawless Roads" and his novel, "The Power and 
the Glory." The results of Sherry's travels are relatively meager, though 
discussed at length and ploddingly. Sherry finds the old man whose toothy look 
inspired Greene's physical description of the Judas figure in "Power and 
Glory." It is quite a jump, though, to assert that this makes him the model for 
the character. 
</P>
<P>
In his research, Sherry had access to Greene's diaries (with an occasional page 
torn out), to a great deal of unpublished correspondence, and to interviews 
with friends and relatives. He also had a number of talks with Greene himself. 
These are curiously unreflected in the book; hardly ever do we get a reference 
to something Greene told the author. "You are grilling me," Sherry quotes him 
as complaining; if so, the heat was on low. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking new material is Greene's letters to Vivien 
Dayrell-Browning before they were married. He met her while at Balliol and fell 
violently in love. She was cool for a long time, but began to soften after he 
converted to her Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
The temper of the letters makes it clear that whatever else went into Greene's 
conversion -- one that would shape his most important writing later on -- Eros 
was at least as important as Grace. His, you might say, was a baptism under 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear one, Darling heart, marvelous wonderful adorable one, Angel, Loveliest in 
the world, Sweetest heart, Dear only one for ever, sweet one, old thing, dear 
desire," goes one courting passage. Later, trying to overcome her resistance by 
proposing a celibate marriage, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"And there'll be winter evenings, when we can make hot buttered toast for each 
other (do you like roast chestnuts? I do), &amp; there'll be summer days with 
the sea sparkling blue . . . &amp; days on the town, &amp; night expresses, and 
evenings sometimes, when we are both sleepy and tired &amp; we'll just read, or 
I'll write &amp; you'll put in a few touches to a design." 
</P>
<P>
It is not what we tend to think of as Greene's prose style. But after a few 
samples -- and long before Sherry exhausts what perhaps he regards as his 
richest trove -- the letters lose their relevance. After all, the meaning a 
love letter has for writer and recipient is not the meaning it has for a third 
party. In effect, we're reading a flawed translation. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental defect in this biography is not a matter of sources, nor a lack 
of assiduousness nor an overbalancing use of what Greene himself has written. 
It is in the mediocrity of the biographer's thought and style. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Greene as a baby: "His infancy went according to nature's and man's 
plan. For four months he was fed at his mother's breast." As a child: 
"Childhood and the innocent eye are temporary." Later on: "The world was not as 
he imagined." Crying at sad stories: "Perhaps this imaginative sympathy with 
the predicaments of others helped to make him a novelist." 
</P>
<P>
Describing a student prank -- Greene and a friend dress up as Gypsies and play 
a barrel organ on the street -- Sherry sees far-reaching implications. Greene 
was "challenging accepted principles, and experiencing life outside the bounds 
of society's protection, which involved hardship and danger (on a minor scale 
as yet), secrecy and disguise." 
</P>
<P>
As for the topographical accuracy of Brighton Rock, Sherry tells us that "what 
Hale observed in the Grand Hotel so must Greene have observed: They were 
drinking cocktails on the terrace." 
</P>

He also writes that Greene "was antipathetic to Mexico" (he didn't like the 
place); and that ". . . there are times when he smiles, with his transparent 
blue eyes giving an impression of blindness, when he unquestioningly looks 
beatific." Unquestionably.

Only those who admire Greene's writing are likely to want to read a biography 
that may fill 1,500 pages when it is finished. And few who admire Greene's 
writing are likely to put up with Sherry's.

HOGARTH: ART AND POLITICS, 1750-1764 by Ronald Paulson Lutterworth Press
Pounds 35, 568 pages
RONALD Paulson's biography of Hogarth appeared originally in two volumes in
1971. In the intervening 22 years much further research on Hogarth and his
period has been accomplished. Not least by Paulson himself, who is Professor
of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Constantly widening
his already encyclopaedic knowledge of this artist, Paulson arrived some
time ago at a point where he has was moved to cover the whole ground again.
He was especially enlightened by spending a week at the Tate scrutinising
the Hogarths in the exhibition of 1971 before it opened.
In 1991 Paulson published the first volume of a greatly revised biography,
Hogarth: The Modern Moral Subject, 1697-1732 (Lutterworth Press Pounds 35)
and in 1992 the second, Hogarth: High Art and Low, 1732-1750 (Lutterworth
Press Pounds 35). With the appearance of this final volume, Paulson sets the
seal on a major work of scholarship that includes both interpretation of all
the works and biographical narrative.
Hogarth's paintings and engravings were executed over a time-span that
begins in the period of Addison's Spectator, which he regarded as a kind of
Bible, and continues through the high Augustan era of Pope and Swift into
the world of Dr Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith. Although not as phenomenally
successful as his younger rival Reynolds, Hogarth represents a much more
significant response to the political and cultural development of the
period. Queen Anne died when he was three; George III was on the throne when
Hogarth himself died, aged 67, in 1764.
There are many points at which his work touches on contemporary literature.
Fielding was a friend and colleague; both as a novelist and as a magistrate
he shared Hogarth's concern about public order and his dread of anarchy.
Smollett was an enemy who satirised Hogarth as Mr Pallett in Peregrine
Pickle. Sterne's way of writing fiction was positively Hogarthian. Defoe and
Richardson both come into the Hogarth story. John Cleland's Fanny Hill
derives from Hogarth. Paulson raises his eyebrows at the absence of any
tribute to Hogarth in Ian Watt's standard The Rise of the Novel and similar
studies.
Hogarth was likewise deeply into poetry. One of Hogarth's earliest works was
a set of illustrations for the verse satire that preceded those of Pope -
Samuel Butler's Hudibras. Hogarth's genius for ridicule was already
riotously in evidence here. Busy crowded woodcuts foreshadow his main
painterly innovation - a pictorial work in consecutive parts, delineating
the progress of an anti-hero, or an anti-heroine, containing coded
references to historical and contemporary people. The tradition of the
'political cartoon' later developed by Rowlandson and Gillray stems from
Hogarth.
The Hudibras illustrations were followed by The Harlot's Progress - a close
kinship here with The Beggar's Opera, which Paulson sees as the transitional
work of the whole period and which Hogarth also illustrated. Then came The
Rake's Progress - a set of paintings aimed at a single purchaser,
accompanied by a parallel edition of prints for popular consumption that
were sold to the public by Hogarth from his workshop on subscription. This
doubling of painting and print was his usual practice: the prints were not
mere copies but often differed in points of detail from their originals.
In London, where Hogarth lived for his entire life, we are fortunate that
much of his best work is easily accessible, not only in galleries like the
Tate but also in those institutions with which Hogarth was associated:
Captain Thomas Coram's hospital for Foundlings of which Hogarth was a
governor - he designed the children's uniform - and St. Bartholomew's
hospital. Above all, there are the 12 fine Hogarths purchased by that great
18th century collector, Sir John Soane, architect to the Bank of England.
They are on view in the Sir John Soane's Museum, 12 Lincoln's Inn Fields.
They consist of the eight original paintings of The Rake's Progress series
and four large canvases done in the last decade of Hogarth's life when he
was exercised by the corruption evident in party politics - An Election.
Paulson deals with this sequence in fascinating depth, showing the contempt
that Hogarth had both for the candidates and the mob.
It was not only party politics that preoccupied Hogarth at this time but
also the politics of art. As a youth he served his apprenticeship as a
silver-plate engraver; he left his master before completing his seven-year
indenture; then he became an assistant to Sir James Thornhill with whose
daughter Jane he eloped. Setting up on his own as an artist-dealer in 1720,
he was much concerned about the protection of engravers' copyrights in their
own prints against pirates and succeeded in getting legislation through
Parliament in favour of the artists. He was active as an instructor at the
re-formed St Martin's Lane Academy and he joined the newly founded Society
of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (now the RSA) where the first annual
exhibitions of paintings in London were held.
Led by Reynolds, many leading artists left the Society and lobbied for an
English Academy on the lines of those in France and Italy. When this
resulted in the formation of the Royal Academy in 1768, Hogarth parted
company from them. He opposed the emphasis the Academy put on the copying of
canonical Renaissance models (prescribed by Reynolds in his annual
Discourses to the students). By contrast Hogarth believed that they way
forward for art in England was by direct, honest, often scurrilously
subversive observation.
Much of Paulson's final volume is taken up with Hogarth's theory of art.
Hogarth expounded it himself in The Analysis of Beauty in 1750 both in a
text and in two engravings. His gesture against the formal symmetry of the
continental ideal was to point to the wavy line, the sinuous shape made by
the letter S, as the basis of the Beautiful. His first print shows a
painter's yard full of statues in S-shaped poses and surrounded on its
border by stays, furniture and other examples of the S-bend. The second
print shows the S-shape as formed in their movements by a group of dancers
at a ball who are doing a minuet. The shape is wayward and variable -
elements of variety and surprise were crucial to his theory of art. Looking
at a painting also implied search. The spectator is encouraged to observe
the picture closely and decode it.
Here Paulson is invaluable. His glosses on the proliferation of emblems and
allusions in Hogarth's work amount to a social history of the period. In his
concluding chapter Paulson deals with Hogarth's last drawing, Tail Piece or
The Bathos made in 1764. At this time Hogarth was under attack from the poet
Churchill and in contention with both Burke and Wilkes. He inscribed on it
in capitals the word FINIS, a sentiment that will now be echoed by his
biographer, with a justifiable sense of triumph.

Closing the Book on a Reviewing Career

Collegial Toast

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Edmund Fuller, whose name and book reviews are familiar to Wall Street Journal readers, is that rarity today among writers-novelist, essayist, editor, critic, biographer, historian. 
In other words, a man of letters, a breed well known in the 19th century, but a vanishing species in the 20th. 
Nowadays most writers, even the prolific among them, are known in only one category or another. 

   For example, Edmund is the author of four novels over a span of years reaching from 1946 to 1970. 
His first, "A Star Pointed North," is durable enough to have been reprinted in 1965 as a Harper Perennial Library paperback. 
Another, "The Corridor," published by Random House in 1963, has appeared in a British edition and a Dutch-language edition. 

   His nonfiction work ranges widely, encompassing a history of the Green Mountain State, a critical study of George Bernard Shaw, a biography of John Milton and a perceptive survey of "Man in Modern Fiction" in which he compares (sadly) the changing view from former to present times as portrayed in novels. 

   As an editor he has compiled with notes and comments Samuel Johnson's "Lives of the Poets," Plutarch's "Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans," a Mark Twain reader and a selection of the great English and American essayists. 

   He has also been a teacher, in the classroom and beyond. 
He has taught at Columbia University, the New School for Social Research, St. Stephen in Rome, and, for a decade, at the Kent School in Connecticut. 

   Naturally his teaching experience resulted in textbooks. 
They include teaching editions of eight Shakespeare plays, "Four Novels for Appreciation," and an "Introduction to the Essay." 

   But enough. 
The shelf of Fuller books is sufficiently long to be impressive in both substance and variety. 
A mere listing of titles could be as tiresome as Homer's catalog of ships at the Trojan War. 
Better to read them than to name them. 

   One in particular is my favorite. 
In younger days Edmund decided to escape the "rat race" of New York where he was an editor in a publisher's office. 
He fled to a New England farm where he encountered just what you'd expect: snows, busted plumbing, recalcitrant pigs, bone-wearing labor and a cow who needed his ministrations for artificial insemination. 
Naturally he turned the experience into a delightful account, "Successful Calamity," literature from life. 

   Edmund showed up at the Journal back in 1963, still a relatively young man, bearded like a pard but already with gray hair. 
Soon, he was our chief book reviewer to the gratitude of successive book editors. 
He has written more book reviews than I care to count, all reflecting both catholic interest and impeccable taste and perception. 

   Now snowy white on top and with a Santa Claus beard, Edmund says he wants to flee this different "rat race" of newbound books piled high and regular deadlines to finish them, even though lately he has lazed along on a two-week schedule instead of every week. 
He professes he's weary even of that and wants to travel with his wife, Anne, or just loll in the Carolina sunshine where (for the second time) he's tasting rural living. 
But this time, no cows. 

   I find that retirement hard to believe. 
Lifetime habits die hard. 
I can't see him breaking the reading addiction, and I think once he succumbs to that he'll be seduced by the temptation of his typewriter. 
Or at least I hope so. 
And I hope he'll grace these pages now and then. 
If not, I'll miss his company and so will thousands of Journal readers. 

   ---
   Mr. Royster is Editor Emeritus of the Journal and the one who inveigled Mr. Fuller into gracing these pages.

   After losing a court battle for the right to
publish an unauthorized biography of J.D. Salinger, Random House
says it will publish ``a substantially new book'' about the
reclusive author and the legal wrangling over the first book.
   The new book, ``In Search of J.D. Salinger'' by Ian Hamilton, is
slated to arrive in bookstores in May. It will be both a biography
of Salinger, author of the 1951 novel ``The Catcher In the Rye,''
and tell the story of Hamilton's unsuccessful effort in 1986 to
publish ``J.D. Salinger: A Writing Life.''
   Salinger, who rarely leaves his Cornish, N.H., home and has
given only one interview in 35 years, came to New York to give a
deposition in the lawsuit against the first book. He claimed
invasion of privacy and infringement of copyright because the
planned biography reproduced some letters he wrote to his friends
and editors between 1939 and 1961.
   The letters had been donated to libraries and were open to
scholarly perusal.
   Last October, after months of appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court
let stand a lower court ruling barring publication of the biography
unless the quotations from and paraphrases of Salinger's letters
were deleted. The court said the letters still belonged to Salinger.
   Jason Epstein, the editor of the book, said, ``The original book
essentially survives within the new book.''
   Gerald Hollingsworth, Random House's general counsel, said, ``I
can't conceive of there being any well-founded legal problems with
this book.''
   Dorothy Olding, Salinger's longtime literary agent, said she had
expected Random House to go ahead with another book and she planned
to inform Salinger's attorney. She said she was certain Salinger
would have no comment.
   In a statement issued by Random House, Hamilton said: ``The new
version is a different sort of book altogether _ more of a literary
adventure story with the biographer as a leading character. ... At
the same time it raises key questions about the whole business of
`biography' _ what is it for, why do we write it, why do people
want to read it and so on.''

   However he is, or will be, appraised as a writer, Thomas Wolfe was a unique happening in 20th-century American literature. 
The huge man from Asheville, N.C., only 37 when he died, often behaved like a monster but also inspired loyalty in long-suffering friends. 
His touch of genius was a vein of ore in a mountain of rubble, a labor to extract and refine. 
In the 1930s he seemed a writer of intense appeal to youth. 
How many of today's younger readers, notoriously intolerant of descriptive prose, will accept him -- unless, ironically, as "different"? 

   David Herbert Donald, of Harvard, is an American historian and political biographer. 
He detoured from the main road of his career into an enormous labor of research and writing to produce another sort of work, "Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe" (Little, Brown, 580 pages, illustrated, $24.95). 

   "Definitive" is a risky adjective for reviewers, but a case can be made for applying it to Prof. Donald's book. 
Fifty years have passed since Wolfe's death. 
Several earlier biographies and many literary studies of him have appeared. 
Yet Prof. Donald is the first biographer since the deaths of the last of Wolfe's intimate colleagues, friends and family members, in whose lifetimes some things could not be published. 
He has had the first access to numerous materials. 

   It is a reasonably safe guess that no more data will come to light sufficient to cause the whole Wolfean trail to be retraced. 
Prof. Donald had the cooperation of every major Wolfe scholar. 
He has had the patience and literary sensitivity to keep all this in balance, though his judgment or taste may lapse on rare occasions. 

   So detailed a narrative of Wolfe's life often seems like an extended reprise of his own writings. 
Possibly no one purporting to write fiction was ever more autobiographical than Wolfe. 
Even so, he preferred often to speak of his "books" rather than of his "novels." 
His works, in spite of his efforts to invent, revert to a telling and retelling of his immediate life experiences, associations, and observations, so literally as to create complicated editorial and legal problems. 

   A great irony was his long struggle to be a playwright, from the early days of The Carolina Playmakers at the University of North Carolina to his studies with George Pierce Baker, at Harvard. 
Baker, who taught some of America's best playwrights, liked Wolfe and believed in his talents, but time confirmed that the essential theatrical disciplines of compression and the ability to work cooperatively with many people in a production, were hopelessly alien to Wolfe's temperament. 
As a collateral irony, the most sustained love of his life was for a considerably older woman, Aline Bernstein, distinguished in the theater as costume and scene designer. 

   Prose was his medium. 
Yet his incantatory, "luxuriant dithyrambs" were often poetic and sometimes seduced editors of his posthumous publications into casting passages into blank-verse typography. 
Repeatedly he proclaimed to Maxwell Perkins, his editor at Scribners, and to Edward Aswell of Harpers, that he was about to do a kind of writing he had never done before. 
He announced grandiose objective projects, yet always returned to the same spate of personal recall. 
The astonishing thing is how well he did it in the luminous best parts of his torrents of words. 

   At moments, Prof. Donald's objectivity seems scarcely to veil a distaste for Wolfe at his behavioral worst, and readers sometimes will be repelled and impatient. 
"Paranoid" is another risky adjective, but Wolfe certainly was that, frequently. 
He made shameless scenes, public and private, when the hair-trigger of his morbid sensitivities was touched. 
Family, friends, lovers, all felt the sting of his ingrained prejudices, including the rampant anti-Semitism that exacerbated his tumultuous bond with Mrs. Bernstein. 
Sinclair Lewis said ruefully, "You couldn't be a friend of Tom's any more than you could be a friend of a hurricane." 

   In passages from Wolfe's letters to Mrs. Bernstein, and varied jottings from his notebooks, Prof. Donald occasionally steps over the boundary of what would have been better left in the archives. 
Also, he has swallowed a few legends whole, whether at second hand or from Wolfe's boasts. 
I doubt that, wandering the streets of Montreux one night with Scott Fitzgerald, Wolfe reached up and pulled down electrical wires, producing a blackout. 

   Prof. Donald argues, unconvincingly, that Wolfe was more of a controlled artist than he was generally credited with being. 
Germane to that, the hottest literary debates have been about the roles of Messrs. 
Perkins and Aswell as editors. 
Mr. Perkins knew he would be "damned for it" someday, though his work with Wolfe made publication of "Look Homeward, Angel" and "Of Time and the River" possible. 
Mr. Aswell has been harshly attacked because it fell to him to shape publishable volumes out of the mass of manuscripts left after Wolfe's shockingly sudden death, in 1937, of cerebral tuberculosis. 

   Prof. Donald examines the problems of textual authenticity, with reproaches for both editors, yet seems to agree that without them the books might never have been published at all. 
His vivid account of the writer's life and thorough analysis of the textual debates make this biography an all but indispensable companion to the future reader of the books of Thomas Wolfe.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Issues of sex and power - Zara Steiner on the pros
and cons of this feminist biography of Eleanor Roosevelt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZARA STEINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT: VOLUME ONE 1884-1933 by Blanche Wiesen Cook Bloomsbury
Pounds 25, 587 pages
THIS biography of Eleanor Roosevelt would not have appeared 20 years ago.
This is not just a question of new documentary sources or even the current
preoccupation with the childhood traumas and sexual activities of our
political leaders, male or female. The new feminist biographers, and Blanche
Cook is one, insist that the issues of sex and power are as central to the
study of women's public roles as men's and that women's passions can provide
the key to their influence and importance.
Rather than the dutiful wife of an American president sublimating her
interests and passions, ER, as she is called throughout this account, is
portrayed as an assertive and independent woman who created her own feminist
agenda. Cook's biography is all the more provocative because in her own
memoirs ER deliberately obscured the historical record, minimising her
political ambitions and revealing almost nothing about her intimate private
life. Her closest friends remained silent and, for the most part, concealed
or destroyed the letters that would have opened Pandora's Box.
In this first volume of two, Professor Cook dwells on ER's complex
inheritance, the alcoholic but adored father and the beautiful if shallow
mother who died when Eleanor was eight. Eleanor's first moment of self
discovery occurred at Allenswood School in London's Wimbledon, where the
Strachey girls and other daughters of the enlightened, wealthy
Anglo-American elite received a disciplined but liberating education. In
this heady emotional and intellectual atmosphere the orphaned ER flowered,
gaining the inner self-confidence and broader range of sympathies so
important to her later development.
The debutante, secret fiancee and then wife of Franklyn Roosevelt returned
to New York to live the conventional life of her sex and class,
distinguished only by a difficult relationship with her domineering
mother-in-law, in whose house she and Franklyn lived, and by the sense of
entrapment and depression that came to engulf the young mother of six. It
was Franklyn's turn to politics and, above all, the shock of discovering his
love affairs that opened ER's inner gates.
Franklyn's flirtations and his almost exclusively masculine political life
encouraged Eleanor to become active in the 'new women's' political groups of
the 1920s. Here she made her first feminist friends, including the political
activists, Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, a lesbian couple who later lived
in a cottage on the Roosevelt estate and with whom ER enjoyed an intimate
personal and professional relationship for over 15 years. As her husband
climbed the political ladder, ER embarked on her own career in politics,
journalism for women's magazines, and part-time teaching at a girls school
bought and run by Eleanor and her friends.
Cook is particularly acute on the kind of bondage created by financial
dependence, whether between mother and son or husband and wife, and its
effects on the Roosevelt marriage and ER's quest for independence. She
catches the tensions created by Eleanor's double life during the early
stages of her husband's struggles with polio and the growing gap between
ER's mother-wife and politician-teacher roles.
The personal compromises and the totally unliberated treatment of her own
daughter suggest how incomplete was ER's emergence from the conventions of
the times, despite her strong female friendships and an independent power
position in an anti-feminist Democratic Party.
There is more in this volume about ER's emotional involvements than about
her political activities though Professor Cook sees them as equal parts of
the same story. These include not only Eleanor's close friendship with Nancy
Cook and others but also her relationship with Earl Miller, the handsome,
young bodyguard who became her companion, defender and champion.
The volume ends with the Roosevelts' move into the White House and the start
of what is described here as Eleanor's lesbian affair with Lorena Hicks, the
Associated Press's senior woman reporter. With so much of the evidence
missing and final conclusions always a question of judgment, Cook follows up
every lead and includes every detail.
If only she had used a more delicate brush when filling in the political
background and selected a wider range of colours when dealing with her male
politicians, we might have been spared some of the all too numerous
illustrations of FDR's shallow and opportunistic political convictions:
Professor Cook's claim that men enter politics for personal fulfilment while
women try to get things done is, even in terms of ER's odyssey, open to
question. A good feminist biography does not need to fight the war of the
sexes.
Commercial reasons apart, the decision to conclude the volume in 1933 raises
questions about the feminist approach to historical biography. In the
not-so-distant past, when little was known about the intimacies discussed
here, it was ER's outspoken political views and public causes that made her
an exceptional presidential wife and the focus of interest and intense
debate. Is it a hopelessly outdated suggestion to say that the sexual life
of any statesman or stateswoman is only of historical interest because of
what they did or accomplished?
If this first volume, written from a feminist perspective, brilliantly casts
its subject in a radically different light, the next must locate her in a
broader context involving issues that go far beyond those of power and
pleasure. It still remains to be seen where ER should stand in the pantheon
of feminist heroines. The focus on who she was and how she lived makes sense
only because of Eleanor's subsequent political and humanitarian
contributions.
If Cook finds the right balance between ER's private and public worlds, she
will not just have created a stir at a time when Hillary Clinton comes to
Washington but will have significantly advanced the cause of feminist
biography. As someone who regularly read Eleanor Roosevelt's syndicated My
Day column, I found this a fascinating and revealing, if disturbing, book. I
wait to read the next volume.

   Oscar-winning film director Oliver Stone
has apologized for wrongly depicting Syracuse police clubbing
college protesters in his movie ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Stone apologized in a letter that was sent to the Syracuse
Police Benevolent Association and addressed to all city residents.
The film won two Oscars at the Academy Awards on Monday night,
including one for Stone for best director.
   ``I took creative license to make my point, and sometimes
sacrificed smaller truths for larger ones,'' Stone wrote. ``There
is, I would like to point out, a disclaimer at the end of the film
to this effect.''
   The movie, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the life story of
Ron Kovic, and his passage from patriotic soldier to anti-war
activist.
   Based on a book by Kovic, the movie depicts city police officers
beating students during a campus protest at Syracuse University in
1970. City police officials denied that officers used violence to
stop college protests.

   Told that Robert Caro was in town, a
longtime associate of Lyndon B. Johnson cracked: ``Who let him in?''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning author says he expects to come in for
criticism in Texas for his dark portrayal of Johnson in the second
volume of his biography of the late president. But he thinks
critics are missing the point.
   ``I wanted to show the transformation,'' Caro was quoted as
saying in an interview published Tuesday in the Austin
American-Statesman.
   ``I don't write biographies just to show the lives of famous
men. I wanted to show what happened with American politics'' at the
dawn of a new age of media politics, he added. The turning point
was the 1948 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate between Johnson
and former Gov. Coke Stevenson.
   ``Nobody had ever run a campaign like that before,'' said Caro,
who in his book ``Means of Ascent'' portrayed Johnson as evil and
Stevenson as a romantic, heroic figure.
   Caro, 53, said the same vigorous reaction greeted his first
volume, ``Path to Power.''
   ``The initial reaction is controversy. After a while, all that's
left is the book. The book endures,'' Caro said.
   Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas, who was an aide and heir to Johnson's
congressional seat, said Caro ``made Coke a saint. We respected
Coke as a solid sort of conservative, but we didn't think of him as
a man of vision _ the saint of all Texans, he was just `Calculatin'
Coke.'''

   Thomas DeBarge, a member of the
DeBarge family band that scored hits with ``Who's Holding Donna
Now?'' and ``Rhythm of the Night,'' was sentenced to 2{ to 20 years
in prison on a drugs' charge.
   While acknowledging DeBarge's talents, Kent County Circuit Judge
Donald Johnston suggested Monday that ``perhaps success came too
quickly'' for the 32-year-old Grand Rapids native.
   DeBarge pleaded guilty in February to possession with intent to
deliver cocaine after being arrested by an undercover officer. He
asked that his sentence be delayed until he completes a
drug-treatment program, but the judge refused because it was
DeBarge's second cocaine-related conviction in four years.

   Some movie stars stayed clear of Hollywood
on Academy Awards night.
   Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon, Ron Silver, Jennifer Beales
and Alec Baldwin, all members of The Creative Coalition, met with
Gov. Mario Cuomo and state legislators Monday to promote
environmental bills.
   ``I think sometimes there's a skeptical attitude about
celebrities, that we just do quick hits,'' Reeve said. ``We are a
serious group.''
   The politically active artists' group have pledged to exploit
its celebrity status to promote legislation in New York state that
aims to protect the environment.
   ``State government has become more powerful as the federal
government has withdrawn from matters of concern to the people of
the state and the nation,'' said Silver, the organization's
president.
   The group supports Cuomo's proposed $1.9 billion environmental
bond act, and will identify lawmakers who try to block
pro-environment bills, Silver said.
   Environmental lobbyist Lee Wasserman said the celebrities could
prove a big boost.
   ``The reasons things don't get done on the environmental front
is the public isn't fully aware of how the process works,''
Wasserman said.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts: Prurience or the pursuit of truth? - Biography is one
of the most popular literary forms. But, says Jackie Wullschlager, its days
may be numbered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Auden thought it should never have been written. The critic Dame Helen
Gardener called it 'a directory for consenting adults.' From the liberal
Bloomsbury Set came calls for wholesale suppression. But thousands of
readers lapped up its story of homosexual love and intrigue, and it changed
the face of post-war British biography.
The book was Michael Holroyd's life of Lytton Strachey, first published in
1967 and re-issued, with much new material, next week. It is still a
marvellous read, and its fresh crop of sexual details - chiefly about the
amorous triangle of Strachey and artists Dora Carrington and Mark Gertler -
continue to interest. But this time round Holroyd's revelation will barely
raise an eyebrow, because the liberal biographical climate which the book
engendered in the 1960s has now become the norm.
No book since Strachey's own Eminent Victorians in 1918 has had a greater
effect on the way we interpret and reconstruct past lives, and to trace the
joint influence of Strachey and Holroyd on modern biography is to trace a
revolution both in our attitudes to sex and to art, as in our growing
fixation on the private lives of public figures. Is the tradition they began
still a liberating force in British culture, or has it now gone too far?
In 1918 Strachey blew the whistle on the earnest, tip-toeing Victorian style
of biography with his sarcastic account of 19th century icons such as
Florence Nightingale and General Gordon. Half a century on, Holroyd's
biography of Strachey turned the tables on the Bloomsbury writer, bringing
to the surface methods of interpretation which Strachey's malicious purring
had only implied. Discussing Strachey's affair with Duncan Grant, the madcap
proposal to Virginia Woolf - 'I was in terror lest she should kiss me' - and
the effect of schoolboy crushes on his neurotic experiences, Holroyd showed
that a full picture of an individual could only be drawn if it included
intimate details, the inner life as well as the output achievement. 'Rather
wonderful and terrible how all that can now be said,' wrote Nancy Mitford of
the book.
Modern literary publishing for good and ill, has never looked back. On the
one hand, Holroyd's spirit of openness and his elegant novelistic style,
burst the floodgates of biographical restraint and made biography a popular,
best-selling genre. Its highlights include some of the best books of the
last 30 years, such as Richard Ellmann's life of Oscar Wilde, Victoria
Glendinning's Trollope, Lyndall Gordon's Charlotte Bronte - all exquisite
accounts of the personal lives of writers within the context of their work
and times.
On the other hand, many recent books suggest that the post 1960s tradition
of tolerant, revealing biography is entering a last, decadent phase in which
all that matters is an artist's sex life. Extended speculation on the sexual
habits of Hardy and his second wife, for example, made Martin Seymour
Smith's massive scholarly biography of the writer, published this year, a
joke. Recent lives of Picasso and Brecht chronicled their lovers rather than
their work. And as new biographical subjects run out, lives of wives and
girlfriends - Lawrence's women, Madox Ford's lover, Flaubert's mistress -
replaced them, licensing pages of dull pillow talk. Where Holroyd or Ellmann
made biography an art form, the tail end of their tradition is degenerating
into vulgar tittle-tattle.
It is no coincidence that Holroyd and Ellmann's masterpieces are both about
homosexual satirists, Strachey and Wilde, who spent their lives trying to
change social and sexual attitudes. Strachey and Wilde's homosexual affairs,
outre poses, the flirtation with scandal marked them as outsiders and were
bound up with the mockery of repressive convention in their works such as
Eminent Victorians and The Importance of Being Earnest. As sexual pioneers,
their biographies cried out for a link between life, art and the wider
social panorama, and it is this which makes Holroyd's Strachey and Ellmann's
Wilde so entertaining and significant.
But take away this dimension, and catalogue Florence Hardy's efforts to
stimulate her ageing husband, or Picasso's pick-ups, and you are left with a
dull quasi-pornographic record masquerading as a serious book. For what
makes sex on the page subversive and interesting is social context. FR
Leavis used to tell his students that Strachey was responsible for the
outbreak of the second world war; Paul Johnson has argued that by destroying
patriotism, Strachey created a national emptiness which became the
homosexual recruiting ground at Cambridge for Soviet espionage.
It was these sort of links between culture and sexuality that made Holroyd's
1967 biography so inflammatory. In 1994, Holroyd's new material centres on
Dora Carrington, Strachey's adoring companion, and the second half of the
book is now also a biography of her. She attracted to their home the sort of
virile, charismatic young men that Strachey loved and married one of them to
ensure that their menage continued. Eventually, she wrote, a lesbian affair
'killed my desires for Les Jeunes Garcons pretty completely,' and when
Strachey died, she shot herself.
This tumultous tale has much gloss and few social reverberations, and is the
weakest part of the book. But so fashionable have flamboyant private lives
like Carrington's become for their own sake, that this new section has
immediately been seized upon to enter 1990s mainstream culture; a film,
Carrington, directed by Christopher Hampton, starring Emma Thompson and
Jonathan Pryce, is to be made of it and will open next spring. Nothing shows
more clearly the revolution in our attitude to private lives that Strachey's
and Holroyd's work has effected this century.
Strachey first weaved sex into cultural criticism - of Virginia Woolf's To
the Lighthouse, he complained that 'It is the lack of copulation that
worries me' - at a time when it was radical and provocative to do so. Now
the pendulum has swung the other way, and our culture goes so far as to
judge public or artistic achievement by private affairs, hence the
biographies which dismiss Picasso's painting or Brecht's plays because their
creators were irresponsible in bed, or the lives of Flaubert's and Madox
Ford's lovers, which accord their subjects artistic status because they
slept with great writers.
Since Lytton Strachey appeared in 1967, there have always been those keen to
curb this prurient interest - from a Spectator article in 1968, warning that
fears of Stracheyesque indiscretion would lead potential biographical
subjects to destroy letters and journals, to the Lord Chancellor's 1993
consultation paper on The Infringement of Privacy, which recommended
restriction of published material causing 'substantial stress, to relatives
or descendants'.
For the biographer, this form of censorship would be disastrous. But
contemporary biography is more endangered by its own decadent trends towards
sex'n'shopping lives than by outside restrictions. The new edition of
Holroyd's classic biography (Chatto Pounds 25, 780 pages) looks as bright
and undated as if it were written this morning - a tribute to its style and
insight, but also a comment on the fact that no new biographical tradition
has emerged since the 1960s. Where is the Michael Holroyd, or indeed the
Lytton Strachey, for the 21st century?

<HEADLINE>  VLADIMIR NABOKOV, THE ALL-AMERICAN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Books; Rehder, a researcher at Hewlett-Packard, is writing a book about Robert
Musil for a German publisher.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Princeton University Press, 783 pp., $29.95; WHO  was ever so unabashedly
American as to count among the most romantic sensations of mankind the first
American moon landing and among his most memorable pleasures "a triangular
gulp of canned beer"?;   Who's that distinguished man who befriended an FBI
agent at Cornell, lauded President Johnson for his "admirable" Vietnam policy,
and dubbed Sigmund Freud the "Viennese Quack"?;    Who ranked Pound a
second-rate poet and Dostoevski a third-rate writer?;   The man "as American
as April in Arizona" -- where he chased butterflies and wrote large parts of
"Lolita" -- is Vladimir Nabokov. And 14 years after his death at 77 he has
become almost a legendary figure.;   No doubt, a Nabokov renaissance is in
full swing. There's a new complete edition in Germany. He's being reclaimed in
Moscow and St. Petersburg as the prodigal son of Russian literature. Vintage
International has brought out his major works in a series of smooth, handsome
paperbacks, including a detective reader's delight, the "Annotated Lolita.";  
In 1989, Nabokov's son Dmitri edited "Selected Letters 1940-1977." A year
later, Brian Boyd published to unanimous acclaim the first volume of his
biography, subtitled "Russian Years." This new volume, "American Years," keeps
all the promises its predecessor ever made.;   No symbols, no Great Ideas;  
Boyd succeeds gloriously in blending the fascinating biographical story of a
remarkable man and a detailed, but imaginative, interpretation of the works
Nabokov wrote during his American years. At the same time, he avoids hunting
down "symbols" and "deeper" meaning and "great ideas," or proclaiming a
"moral" in Nabokov's plays and novels. For Nabokov there is a moral in
science, in scholarship, and in dealing with the Bolsheviks, whom he loathed
from beginning to end. But the distinction between "good" and "bad" in art
isn't a matter of eternal ideas, but a matter of talent, style, a sharp pencil
and an incredibly high intensity of work. There's passion in science, Nabokov
has often said, but there must be absolute precision in poetry.;   At the
center of Boyd's book stands, naturally, "Lolita." First published in 1955 by
the "pornographer" Maurice Girodias and his Olympia Press in Paris, it took
another three years of haggling and cajoling and luck to find a U.S. publisher
with enough muscle to defend it in court, if necessary. While "Lolita" was
making big waves in Europe, Walter Minton of Putnam's heard from a former
showgirl in Paris about the novel. On Aug. 18, 1958, "Lolita" hit the book
market in New York like a hurricane.;   The reviews were magnificent, and
detractors were just sufficiently outraged to add fuel to the fire. Very
importantly, the courts had been skillfully quieted in advance through a
careful campaign by scholars and critics who were beyond reproach. Early on,
Graham Green had selected "Lolita" as one of the three best books of 1955.
Dorothy Parker raved: "A fine book, a distinguished book -- all right, then --
a great book." Others were equally enthusiastic with their praise: William
Styron, Harry Levin, Lionel Trilling. "Lolita" was compared to James Joyce's
"Ulysses," one of the few classics even Nabokov admired. On Sept. 13 the New
York Times announced that "Lolita" had become the first book since "Gone with
the Wind" to sell 100,000 copies in its first three weeks.;   (Stanley
Kubrick's movie followed in 1962, with the late James Mason as Humbert Humbert
and Sue Lyon as Lolita. At present, director Adrian Lyne is planning a "more
sensual" "Lolita" with Dustin Hoffman. This new screenplay by James Dearden is
supposedly closer to the novel and perhaps also to Nabokov's own screenplay
that he wrote in Hollywood as a guest of Kubrick's. I, for one, am not holding
my breath to see how Mrs. Robinson's boy turns lecherous eyes on a Lolita who
watches Madonna videos and imitates Paula Abdul's cheerleading.);   Set free
by 'Lolita';   For Nabokov, "Lolita" meant, finally, financial independence.
He quit his job at Cornell, and brought to a close a distinguished academic
career that had moved him through Stanford, Wellesley, Harvard and Cornell,
from "lean lecturer to full professor." At last he was free to pursue the most
"intense pleasures known to man": writing and hunting butterflies.;   But
there's much more to Boyd's biography, and to Nabokov the professor and
author, than the sensations and success surrounding "Lolita." Nabokov himself
believed that he would be remembered by "Lolita" and his painstakingly literal
translation of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." This translation led to one of the
most ferocious, relentlessly public trans-Atlantic literary battles ever: his
feud with Edmund Wilson over prosody, exactness and fidelity to the original
text. A long friendship was sacrificed for literary and artistic principles.; 
 American readers may find the deceptively funny and deeply moving "Pnin" the
easiest book to enjoy. But beware: Toward the end of the book Nabokov himself
makes a surprise appearance -- well, not to spoil the innocent fun, but to
show that there is no innocence.;   Or "Pale Fire," a poem in 999 verses, with
a commentary which "is the book." There is, first, the literary genius, the
poet Shade, whose poem is edited with an amazing, and fake, learnedness by the
commentator Professor Kinbote. There are the playful games of word golf and
polyglot puns. But there's also the darker side of a deeper consciousness, and
a murder, and one of the saddest and simplest and most poetic lines in
American fiction, when Shade's daughter drowns in the lake at Lochan Neck.;  
Nabokov's last great success, "Ada," made the cover of Time magazine in 1969.
By that time, he was long settled in a comfortable hotel in Montreux,
Switzerland. Here the postal service functioned; there were no strikes and
demonstrations. Here he held court, wrote and gave interviews -- questions
submitted and answered in writing only, please -- because he hated the ad hoc
chat, the peeping questions into his personal life, and because he loathed
seeing his ramblings in print. He saw himself, as humble as ever, in these
terms: "I think like a genius, write like a distinguished author, and speak
like a child.";   Boyd's biography sets out to present all three, the
cosmopolitan genius of letters, the famous author of Russian and American
books, and the amazing path of a child born to stupendous wealth, growing up
in exile. The child became a man of letters, who protected his Russian
language like a threatened treasure, and a family man, who with wife Vera and
son Dmitri barely escaped Hitler in France. At 41, he began inventing and
living yet another full life when he came to America in 1940, his home for 19
years.;   Perhaps it is a pity that Nabokov kept so much to the Russian
emigrants when he lived in Europe. It prevented him from knowing other writers
who might have lived up even to his exacting standards; for example Robert
Musil, who also retreated to Switzerland. He read some Thomas Mann, whom he
quickly dismissed as artificial, along with Stendhal, Auden, Balzac. Or
perhaps it's for the better that he avoided the potholes of Western European
literatures. It may have helped him steer a clear route from the melancholic
rustle of Russian through the elegance of French into the rich simplicity of
English. For in which other language do you have the ability to describe, as
Nabokov did in the autobiographical "Speak, Memory," a baby's burp as a
"post-lactic all-clear signal" and still sound amusing? (box)  </TEXT>

   The Quintessential English Romantic

   To his lifelong friend Charles Lamb, he was "an archangel
slightly damaged." To his early disciple turned vociferous
critic William Hazlitt, he was a man "sunk into torpid,
uneasy repose, tantalized by useless resources, haunted by
vain imaginings, his lips idly moving." To almost everyone
who encountered him, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was
a dazzling force of nature. Part poet, part orator, part
metaphysical seer, he was a wordsmith who invariably beguiled
his auditors with an unstoppable stream of brilliant,
intoxicating talk.
   The cataract of talk even reached into posterity. "He
seems not a man," wrote Virginia Woolf, "but a swarm, a
cloud, a buzz of words, darting this way and that,
clustering, quivering, and hanging suspended." Yet Coleridge
was much more than a fountain of words. As his biographer,
Richard Holmes, shows in his superlative account of
Coleridge's early life, "Coleridge: Early Vision" (Viking,
409 pages, $22.95), he was in many ways the quintessential
English Romantic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than the grim and prosey Wordsworth, perhaps even
more than the flamboyant Byron or the ethereal Shelley,
Coleridge incarnated the spiritual aspirations of his age.
That he also incarnated its excesses and liabilities is only
too familiar. Coleridge the stalled writer, the irresponsible
dreamer, the shameless plagiarizer; Coleridge the opium
addict and burnt-out case: All that is as much a part of our
literary folklore as Coleridge the author of "Kubla Khan" and
"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
   In this first of two projected volumes, Mr. Holmes takes
us from Coleridge's birth at Devon to the eve of his
departure for Malta in 1804. He chronicles, in other words,
the career of the visionary Coleridge: the radical utopian
schemer and poetic innovator who dreamed of a commune by the
Susquehanna River in America and who collaborated with
Wordsworth on "Lyrical Ballads."
   He also writes of Coleridge the unhappy and perpetually
absent husband, the unrequited lover, the increasingly
despondent and drug-sodden waster. Still to come are
Coleridge the great literary critic, the religious thinker,
the public philosopher.
   The youngest of 10 children, Coleridge found his bucolic
home life shattered when his father -- a learned minister and
schoolmaster -- died in 1781. The young boy was promptly
packed off to school at Christ's Hospital in London, a
brutalizing place that nonetheless provided him with a good
grounding in classics and, eventually, a scholarship to Jesus
College, Cambridge.
   Coleridge was ferociously precocious, able to read a
chapter of the Bible when only three and blessed with an
extraordinary memory. But he proved to be a dilatory student
at best. Already at Cambridge his vacillating and irresolute
character was on full display. Mr. Holmes duly reports the
"wild expenditure on books, drinking, violin lessons, theater
and whoring . . . alternating with fits of suicidal gloom and
remorse." "Coleridge was," he notes, "a man who could confess
spiritual despair at midday; and dine out brilliantly at
midnight."
   But in truth it was restlessness, not sloth, that was
Coleridge's besetting vice. Would that more of us were as
productive as he] Always a prodigious walker, he once covered
263 miles in eight days. He was capable of writing 76
newspaper articles in five months or composing 50 blank verse
lines of a translation of Schiller's "Wallenstein" in a
single day.
   Yet he could not stay put. A planned three-month trip in
Germany with the Wordsworths stretched on for 10 months. As
usual, his wife, Sara, remained impatiently behind with the
children, one of whom died while his father was away.
Coleridge was as addicted to drawing up lists of impossible
works and projects as he was to opium. "He dreamed more than
he planned," writes Mr. Holmes, "he planned more than he
could execute {and he was} never still or concentrated for
more than a few weeks at a time."
   Mr. Holmes does not attempt to excuse Coleridge's
failings. But his enthusiasm for this damaged archangel
remains undiminished. Rather, like Coleridge himself, he
understands -- and lets us understand -- that "the hope of
recreating himself imaginatively out of the sense of failure
itself" early on became one of Coleridge's chief spurs to
creativity and reflection.
   In this, Coleridge could not have been more different from
Wordsworth. While Wordsworth was composing his great
Immortality Ode, with its vision of the past as a "perpetual
benediction," Coleridge wrote "Dejection: An Ode," meditating
on "A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,/ Which finds no
natural outlet, no relief."
   This account of the young Coleridge is a fit sequel to Mr.
Holmes's magisterial biography of Shelley (1974). Perhaps its
greatest achievement is to have reminded us of how complex
Coleridge was, how he managed to salvage an enlivening
passion even from disappointment and dissipation. "If he does
not leap out of these pages -- brilliant, animated, endlessly
provoking -- and invade your imagination," Mr. Holmes writes
in his preface, "then I have failed to do him justice." Few
readers, perhaps, will close this book unexasperated by
Coleridge's foibles; I think none will come to the end
unmoved by his painfully expansive genius.

Closing the Book on a Reviewing Career
---
A Critic's Notes
---
By Edmund Fuller</HL>
<DD> 05/05/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Of the reading of books there is no end and much reviewing is a weariness of the flesh. 
The paraphrase is too easy, but irresistible. 
For 23 1/2 years I have written columns about books for this newspaper. 
Now I feel it wise to withdraw from schedules. 
The decision rompts a few reflections. 

   It will give me a chance to read some books about which I shall have no duties, no deadlines. 
It will provide opportunity for me to put some words on paper, from time to time, without concern over whether they are ever printed. 
It will be enough if they remain as family chronicle. 
I shall not trap myself into commitments even to myself, but will let the spirit move me. 

   In a lifetime of varied mischiefs, it has fallen to me to write and to edit, as well as to review, books. 
The present thoughts, however, are preoccupied with some of what it means to read them. 
It has been argued that it is better for a person to read at any level of quality, even utter trash, than to read nothing. 
I'm not persuaded of that. 
A familiar saying, which never impressed me, is, "You are what you eat." 
Far more interestingly, as generalizations go: "You are what you read." 

   Recently, at Guilford College, not far from us in North Carolina, my wife and I heard a notable talk about education and faith by the elder statesman of American Quakers, Elton Trueblood. 
He laid special emphasis on one aspect of the printed word. 
Transcending time, space and languages of origin, it gives us the extraordinary freedom to choose the intellectual company we will keep, to select those with whom, in spirit, we will walk. 
That is a privilege. 
Moreover, to those who can see it so -- a minority, Elton Trueblood asserts -- in the highest sense it is a duty, in at least a due proportion of our reading time. 
Paraphrasing Joshua, "Choose you this day whom you will read." 

   Yet I don't want to sound solemncholy (my father made up that word, in my childhood, to go with melancholy). 
I love fantasy and romance in all their forms -- any great tale greatly told. 
I relish the masters of "nonsense" (the likes of Lewis Carroll or Edward Lear), which at its best is a fanciful form of sense. 
I like the playful and the trivial (in the spirit of Logan Pearsall Smith's "Trivia," which is not the game of the name). 
Samuel Johnson said, "There is nothing, Sir, too little for so little a creature as man." 

   It took experience to learn that, exalted as tragedy is, superb comedy is no less great. 
Building an intimacy with Shakespeare, we see his genius, in a differing mode, in his late comedies as much as in "Hamlet" or "Lear." 
Laughter at our follies, and the redemptive joy of seeing things resolved as they ought to be, are crowning human experiences. 
They teach us, also, as do such fairy tales as "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Sleeping Beauty." 
Awakening, in every sense, is a part of learning. 

   It has been my responsibility and pleasure, in these columns, to select the books I've reviewed, trying not to ride my hobbyhorses too hard, to consider diverse tastes and interests among readers. 
The choices have included novelists, dramatists, poets, historians, biographers, journalists, scientists, philosophers, as well as theologians of several faiths. 
Generally, outright trash has been avoided. 
Tricky exceptions were when I felt a point was to be made -- especially if the trash came from a writer of some literary pretensions, with the applause of a narrow establishment, so that a few voices (I've not been alone) were needed to say what the stuff really was. 
Inevitably, I remember three kinds of mistakes, the bane of every longtime reviewer: the books I overpraised, underpraised or overlooked. 

   There is another aspect of reading. 
We hear a great deal about illiteracy, the extent of which is a national disgrace. 
What we don't hear enough about is "aliteracy." 
"Aliteracy" is a recent term, which does not, to my surprise and dismay, appear in any dictionary I have at hand, including an American unabridged and the encyclopedic Oxford English Dictionary, with its latest supplements. 
Yet I have used it, have seen and heard it used, for some 10 years. 
"Aliteracy" is to literacy as "amorality" is to morality. 
It uses the prefix "a" in the sense of "without," to denote hosts of people who can read but who don't or won't. 
That is the wanton neglect, the deliberate discarding, of a heritage available to all. 

   The book is the greatest medium for general education, for the rich furnishing of a mind beyond utilitarian tools. 
Granted that in mathematics, the physical sciences, medicine and other technologies, more than the book is required. 
Yet otherwise -- an immense otherwise -- an education lies at hand to anyone willing to seize it. 
Books contain incalculable resources and rewards to fill a lifetime. 

   Finally, reviewers and readers of reviews can fall into a habit of thinking of books as the titles of the current season. 
Books are neither for one season nor for one reading. 
The good, or the great, in many genres, many languages, from any time, any where, are to be read and reread. 
You must find the limits of how much you can read, then choose some things old and some things new, and work out your own balance between them. 
We reread certain books many times across the phases of our lives and see new things in them each time. 
A good handful -- none more so than the Bible -- stays beside us through the whole of life. 

   I say goodbye to scheduled reviewing -- ambivalently, because I have loved the forum -- but not goodbye to reading. 
There's a chance that I might meet old friends now and then on this page. 
Meanwhile, to many persons who have written to me in all that time, only a few of whom I've been able to answer but all of whom deserved a reply, my apologies where due, but beyond all, my thanks.

FT  18 APR 92 / Books: An un-literary biography - Waugh without his art

NO ABIDING CITY: EVELYN WAUGH 1939-1966 by Martin Stannard JM Dent Pounds
25, 523 pages
GRAHAM Greene, in a much-quoted phrase, said that his friend Evelyn Waugh
was 'the greatest novelist of my generation'. Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford
in another well-known quotation: 'You have no idea how much nastier I would
be if I was not a Catholic . . . ' There is the challenge to the biographer:
to show how the literary genius co-existed with the cruel, tormented,
snobbish, offensive, reactionary old buffer.
The second volume of Martin Stannard's biography opens in 1939 with the
fashionable author of black comedies joining the Royal Marines as an
over-age trainee officer - or rather, as he saw it, as a Catholic crusader
in the defence of Christendom.
The love affair with the army was short, and painful on both sides. Waugh
came to feel that he was unwanted (which was true) and that the cause had
been dishonoured; his five days in Crete gave him a conclusive sense of
national disgrace. He began to turn his life into a fiction - 'sensitive,
Catholic, bundled out of a Protestant war because he would not compromise
his honour . . . ' writes Stannard. 'Everyone else had to be wrong . . . '
Here was the impetus for the post-war writings, and also for his short,
unhappy life; he retreated into a dream, a fixation with a romantic and
unreal past.
An important part of that fiction was his infatuation with the aristocracy.
He never truly belonged to it, he was reacting against his Golders Green
birth and his middle-class father. As his son Auberon has written: 'Although
the Waughs were an eminently respectable family . . . the gulf between them
and the carefree traditions of the aristocracy was as great as if he had
been a fishmonger's assistant'. That may be a bit strong but the idea can
stand: there must have been hypocrisy as well as eccentricity in Waugh's
life, which would have heightened self-parody and unreality and, in his
literary art, 'the confusion of social grace with moral worth' (in one of
Stannard's sharper phrases).
Stannard lingers over the detail of Waugh's increasingly isolated and
misanthropic years as country gent. His days were taken up with family,
church, library, increasingly distant friends, and drunken jaunts to London.
He was an old man long before his time.
His (second) marriage, one suspects, will remain mysterious: he must have
been an impossible man. His deficiencies as a father have been aired again
in his son's recent autobiography. The father said of his children: 'I can
only see them as defective adults, feckless, destructive, frivolous,
sensual, humourless . . . ' Was that a joke? Presumably not - the sentence
comes from his diaries. Was it self-parody?
The fundamental concern of his life was his Catholicism, and Stannard
rightly emphasises his obsession with the preservation and propagation of
the Faith, He awaited death for years. He was afraid of madness, and in The
Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold in 1957 he left a remarkable report on his own
breakdown. Stannard gives the episode a central place in his tale. Were
Waugh's 'voices' the result of an overuse of narcotics, as he afterwards
claimed, or, as Stannard suggests, did the drugs release 'a barrage of
self-hatred . . . his private catalogue of self-reproach'? If he was mad,
perhaps he should have bitten a few more of our novelists . . .
Stannard's biography is careful, readable, and appears exhaustive until one
realises its great weakness, which is that it too rarely illuminates the
most important area of Waugh's life - there is almost no sense of Waugh at
work as writer. There is a welter of detail about the minutiae of the years,
his wartime postings, his feuds with Cyril Connolly, and so on and so forth.
But what happened when this dyspeptic and lonely man closed his library
door, settled at his desk, and picked up his fountain pen? We are not told.
It turns out to be a curiously un-literary biography.

JOHNSON AND BOSWELL IN SCOTLAND: A JOURNEY TO THE HEBRIDES edited by Pat
Rogers Yale Pounds 25, 330 pages
TRAVELLERS, however jaded, usually see the need to enliven their accounts of
unfamiliar places with a sense of curiosity and excitement; their attitude
is the opposite of that affected by the Matabele emissaries, in Stanlake
Samkange's Zimbabwean novel On Trial For My Country, who have been told not
to 'keep on saying au] au] au] in amazement'. On seeing the sea for the
first time at Cape Town, one of them remarks simply: 'Ah] Today the river is
in flood'.
Dr Johnson, in remote regions, has no hesitation in exclaiming at
'mountains, waterfalls, peculiar manners; in short, things which he had not
seen before'. Johnson and Boswell in Scotland accentuates the drama of
travel by supplying two narratives to read alongside each other: Johnson's
Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775) and Boswell's Journal of a
Tour to the Hebrides (1785). While Johnson is busy observing 'peculiar
manners' and the like, Boswell is entertained and elated at being able to
view his thoroughly urbanised friend and mentor in an unaccustomed setting.
The pleasures of this double narrative are evident when the travellers come
across their first Highland hut. Johnson is full of investigatory fervour.
Luckily, 'to enter a habitation without leave, seems to be not considered
here as rudeness or intrusion'. 'True pastoral hospitality' prompts the
peasant woman inside the hut to invite them to drink whisky.
As Johnson gathers information, Boswell is sharply aware of the social
comedy generated by the situation. His companion's interest in primitive
architecture prompts him to ask where the woman sleeps, and she answers
'with a tone of emotion, saying she was afraid we wanted to go to bed to
her'. Rather cruelly, they derive great amusement from 'this coquetry of so
wretched a being'; each claims banteringly that it is the other who has
'alarmed the poor woman's virtue'.
Some of the narrative tension of the book is, of course, derived from the
close - but intermittently combative - relationship between the two men.
Returning from the Western Isles, Boswell is overcome with apprehension, as
he anticipates the meeting between his father, Lord Auchinleck, and Johnson,
his surrogate father: 'I was very anxious that all should be well; and
begged of my friend to avoid three topics; Whiggism, Presbyterianism, and -
Sir John Pringle.'
Johnson periodically annoys Boswell (a lowland Scot) by his rudeness about
Scotland. At one point, he declares that, until the Union with England, the
tables of the Scots 'were coarse as the feasts of Esquimeaux, and their
houses filthy as the cottages of Hottentots'.
Such analogies with far-flung regions are frequent, and not always
disparaging: once the two men reach the Highlands, they both excitedly
compare the scenes before them to the wilds of America. Boswell finds their
visit to one village 'much the same as being with a tribe of Indians', to
which Johnson replies: 'Yes, sir; but not so terrifying.'
The desire to leave dull familiarity behind is never expressed here quite as
strongly as it is in EM Forster's A Room with a View, when the heroine, in a
Florentine pensione, laments: 'It might be London'. Nonetheless, Johnson
seems gratified when his experience of feudal hospitality convinces him that
'the fictions of the Gothic romances were not so remote from credibility as
they are now thought'.
His pleasure in new and surprising sights is tempered by a vehement
repudiation of fantastic travel literature - the tales of monstrous beings
that proliferate in medieval travel narratives, and survive, in the 18th
century, in wild speculations about Patagonian giants and other curious
phenomena. Johnson opposes all such 'credulity', and is resolutely sceptical
about the poems of Ossian - works published by James Macpherson in the
1760s, in the guise of translations from a Gaelic epic.
Delight in novelty, moreover, cannot entirely deaden the awareness that 'to
live in perpetual want of little things, is a state not indeed of torture,
but of constant vexation'. Many contemporary travellers to the third world -
or to the English countryside on a Sunday - will sympathise with this
measured response to the absence of a shop on Skye.
In some other ways, Johnson's narrative may seem alien to late
twentieth-century readers: he feels none of the constraints of tourism,
which began to trouble travellers to Italy a few decades later, and his
Journey lacks any concept of a Byronic urge to move ever onwards, or to
place one's self-identity at risk. (Revealingly, he describes with approval
how, in ancient Gaul, Caesar came along and 'put a stop to' the engagingly
feckless plans of the Helvetians to wander off 'they knew not whither'.)
Boswell's narrative has more in common with contemporary travel writing,
simply because it often focuses on the personal feelings of the traveller
himself: he describes his fits of gloom, made worse by the experience of
being trapped on islands by bad weather.
Johnson, however, in his resolute pursuit of knowledge, touches on many
questions relevant to current debates about cultural difference. He is
scornful of the moral relativism that justifies any form of human behaviour
by showing it to be acceptable in some exotic region.
Montesquieu, for example, 'to support polygamy' tells you of the island of
Formosa, where there are ten women born for one man. The trouble with this
argument, Johnson cheerfully points out, is that 'he had but to suppose
another island, where there are ten men born for one woman, and so make a
marriage between them'.
Johnson and Boswell in Scotland provides immensely pleasurable reading; its
delights are increased by the thoughtful choice of illustrations, and only
slightly marred by the decision to cut Boswell's text, and supply the barest
minimum of explanatory notes.
Within the domains of literary criticism and of history, travel writing is
usually appropriated either by old-fashioned anecdotalists, snobbishly
preoccupied with the antics of aristocrats, or by proponents of the new
critical orthodoxy of colonial studies - which, as it becomes absorbed into
established systems of academic deference, is in danger of losing its
initial intellectual energy. Accessible and attractive editions of travel
writings, such as this, throw open the field to a wider readership, and
encourage a more diverse range of approaches.

<TEXT>
<P>
I can think of no better way to pass the time as we await the arrival of a new 
century than to read these letters of Henry Adams, who watched with great 
interest and trepidation the passing of the 19th Century and the arrival of the 
20th. The grandson of one president, great-grandson of another, living across 
Lafayette Square from the White House but constantly traveling the world, an 
observer and occasional behind-the-scenes influence but never an active 
participant in government affairs, Adams had a unique view of the events of his 
time. His "Education of Henry Adams" is perhaps the most brilliant intellectual 
autobiography in American literature. 
</P>
<P>
These letters to women friends, to nieces and brothers, to artists, scientists 
and statesmen and to many other friends and relatives, provide an insight into 
Adams' thoughts as his "Education" and its companion volume "Mont-Saint-Michel 
and Chartres" began to take shape. They reveal his passionate curiosity about 
unfolding events, his never-ending desire to find meaning in history and his 
sometimes astonishing power of prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
The first three volumes (published in 1982) of this six-volume set cover the 
years 1858-1891. The newly published, latter three volumes begin in 1892 and 
end a few days before his death at age 80, in March, 1918. More accessible than 
some of Adams' published writings, they provide perceptive commentary on all 
the momentous events of the period: the Panic of 1893, the Spanish-American and 
Boer wars, William Jennings Bryan and the silver question, the Administrations 
of Cleveland, McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, the sinking of the Lusitania and 
the beginnings of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
By far the greatest number of letters are to Elizabeth Cameron, the beautiful 
woman nearly 20 years his junior to whom he grew increasingly attached after 
his wife's suicide in 1885. According to Adams' biographer, Ernest Samuels, 
their relationship was apparently quite proper, in spite of gossip. She was the 
wife of Pennsylvania Sen. J. Donald Cameron and the niece of Sen. John Sherman 
(of the Sherman Antitrust Act) and Gen. William T. Sherman. Adams was usually 
quite restrained in indicating his feelings for her, but because of her 
intelligence and awareness of social and political power plays, he seems to 
have found her an ideal confidant. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' letters to Mrs. Cameron from Washington are, as the editors say, "the 
best court gossip an American has ever recorded." He wrote about the small 
dinners he attended at the Roosevelt White House and of what he had learned 
about the latest in national and international affairs when he entertained his 
friends the John Hays, the Henry Cabot Lodges, foreign diplomats and others in 
places of power. When he was away from Washington, she was his best informant. 
"Madame de Pompadour," he called her. "You are the only person who sees people 
and the world. You alone have the instinct, and take the trouble, and do the 
work." The same could be said of Adams himself. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' admiration for women, but regret at their wasted energies, is one of the 
themes in his letters that foreshadow passages in the "Education." In the 
chapter titled "Vis Inertiae (1903)," for example, he called contemporary 
American women a "failure." They had been set free, thanks to the greatly 
increased expenditure of artificial energy on their households, but their own 
potential energy was being wasted. As he wrote to a woman friend in 1905 while 
the "Education" was in progress, the American woman "has held nothing together, 
neither State nor Church, nor Society nor Family." To young George Cabot Lodge, 
however, he predicted that woman "is only beginning her career. . . . What will 
please her a century hence is a fascinating subject of reflection. . . . A 
branch of the sex is sure to break off as an emancipated social class. If I 
were beginning again as a writer, I think I should drop the man, except as an 
accessory, and study the woman of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Energies and forces, whether social, political or physical, are a major theme 
in Adams' letters, as in his published work. "Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres" 
explores the unity of religious belief during the Middle Ages as the force 
behind the building of the great Gothic cathedrals, while the "Education" is 
concerned with the multiplicity of energies that fragment the modern world. The 
contrast between the two periods especially impressed him, as he told various 
correspondents, when he went from Paris to Washington. Summers in Paris he was 
"living in the 12th Century," making daily excursions into the countryside to 
attend services at Chartres and "collect" spires and stained-glass windows. In 
the winter he returned to Washington and the 20th Century, amazed at finding 
himself in a "hundred-mile-an-hour country" whose rising power in the world 
astounded him. 
</P>
<P>
To his brother, Brooks, whose "Law of Civilization and Decay" (published in 
1895) was an important influence on his own work, he wrote about his interest 
in physics, which had been stimulated by studying the dynamos at the Paris 
Exposition of 1900, and of his efforts to calculate accelerating rates of 
energy consumption. Henry was convinced that at the rate the world was 
developing its power resources, it would "break its neck" in 30 years or so. 
"My belief is that science is to wreck us, and that we are like monkeys 
monkeying with a loaded shell; we don't in the least know or care where our 
practically infinite energies come from or will bring us to." 
</P>
<P>
By 1909, Adams had begun to study the writings of William Thompson, Lord 
Kelvin, on whose Second Law of Thermodynamics Adams hoped to build a scientific 
theory of history. His 1910 "Letter to American Teachers of History," intended 
to shake up members of the profession whom he believed were "dead as dormice," 
was a classic statement of fin-de-siecle pessimism. In it Adams proposed that 
thought, like other forms of energy, would gradually become dissipated. 
Civilization was declining, not progressing upward as the social Darwinists had 
been claiming. "Kelvin was a great man," he wrote to a friend in 1909, "and I 
am sorry I did not know enough mathematics to follow him instead of Darwin who 
led us all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Reading the letters makes one feel a part of the time; it is a painless way to 
read history. The editors have supplied excellent introductions, which give the 
reader an overview of Adams' activities. The notes are always helpful, although 
those that first identify a correspondent may be in an earlier volume and are 
sometimes hard to find. Identifying notes from volumes one to three are not 
repeated in these later volumes. There are good indexes in volumes three and 
six, covering the contents of the first and second series of letters, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The letters will be especially useful to scholars, but they can be read with 
great enjoyment by anyone who makes a little effort to learn the cast of 
characters. Adams is never dull. His witty, ironic style often amuses, even 
when he is discussing apocalyptic events. His perceptive observations on the 
beginnings of the 20th Century give us, looking back on it, a new understanding 
of what we have been through.

THE INTERIOR CASTLE: A LIFE OF GERALD BRENAN by Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 660 pages
THE STORY so far, just in case you have forgotten the details:
Carrington loved Lytton. Lytton, while tolerating Carrington, loved Ralph.
Ralph loved Carrington. In order to remain close to Lytton, Carrington
agreed to marry Ralph without being in love with him. Gerald was Ralph's
greatest friend after Lytton and like Ralph had fought bravely at the Front
in the world war. Ralph, Gerald and Carrington were in a situation similar
to that of Jules et Jim and Jeanne Moreau in the film. Their triangle
exploded and all but ended the friendship between the two men when Ralph
discovered Gerald had been making love to Carrington.
Then Lytton died aged 52 in 1932. Carrington, inconsolable, committed
suicide as she had threatened. Ralph married Frances, and Gerald went to
Yegen in Spain, in the remote then almost inaccessible Alpujarra. He
fathered a child, Miranda, by a 15-year-old Spanish peasant-girl, Juanita.
Then Gerald married Gamel Woolsey, a southern belle with poetic ambitions,
who had settled in England and had become the mistress of Llewelyn Powys.
She now went to Spain with Gerald. Gamel and Gerald brought up Miranda as
their daughter, sent her to boarding school, and then . . .
But hold on. I am starting to anticipate Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy's highly
readable, splendidly complete, marathon life of Gerald Brenan in which these
entanglements, some much written about already, starting with Michael
Holroyd's life of Lytton Strachey, are seen from a fresh, revealing angle -
that of Gerald. From the earlier biographies you might have concluded that
Gerald had played only a minor role in the Lytton/Carrington story, but it
now becomes clearer than ever before just how crucial his part was.
Gerald was formidably equipped with literary gifts that were slow to mature
alongside a combative nature. Throughout his long life he had close
friendships with, and influenced, many clever people of later generations as
well as making, through his books, a significant contribution to British
understanding of Spain. In all Gerald presents a testing challenge to a
biographer, and it is one to which Gathorne-Hardy has risen energetically.
The contrast with Lytton, with whom Gerald is sometimes compared on the
ground that he did for Spanish literature what Lytton had done in England
for French, is extreme. To begin, Gerald lived 40 years longer than Lytton.
He died in 1987, just short of his 93rd birthday. Again, Lytton, a
homosexual Bloomsbury guru, was by temperament a Cambridge intellectual, an
Apostle, a stay-at-home with a Gallic vision - the one occasion when he was
persuaded to venture abroad to visit Gerald, described in Gerald's
masterpiece, South From Granada, was a near-disaster.
By contrast, Gerald managed to combine the life of the mind with a life of
adventure and travel. His military father insisted he took the Sandhurst
entrance examination after Radley. But Gerald avoided going there by making
his first and greatest escape. He left home abruptly one morning aged 18 and
set off on a walk across Europe with a friend, Hope-Johnstone, his earliest
mentor. It was a crazy thing to do, but it set the pattern of his life, one
of defiant exile. Then and later, it was, financially, a precarious
existence subsidised by borrowing and spongeing. Gerald persuaded a rich
aunt to make him a regular allowance on which he lived for many years.
In 1914 he joined the army he had so recently avoided. He became an infantry
officer, an observer on the Somme, and was awarded the Military Cross. It
was the only time Gerald had a regular job. After the first war Gerald's
life divides into long periods of residence in Spain broken by short periods
of return to rural England. Gerald spent most of his life pursuing women
while simultaneously educating himself by reading voraciously in various
literatures. He always wanted to be a poet and continued to write poetry
into old age. He was at the same time full of plans for prose-books, novels,
biographies and cultural histories, some of which took years to mature,
others were half-written and jettisoned.
The fact that he did not publish much till late in life - his reputation as
a writer was only really secure in 1951 after the appearance of The
Literature of the Spanish People - means that Gathorne-Hardy is able to
concentrate on the inner man for long stretches. As his title, The Interior
Castle, implies, Gerald pulled up the drawbridge on his true self even more
firmly than most writers, and Gathorne-Hardy ruthlessly prises it open.
The attachment to women began early in classic public school style with an
infant pass at his Nanny. Gathorne-Hardy published an authoritative history
of the Nanny in 1972 and therefore deserves to be heeded when he claims it
may have been a voyage of discovery in bed with his Nanny that started
Gerald off on a long series of attachments to women of the lower classes.
At any rate, childhood left Gerald with a strong voyeur instinct that he
went to excessive lengths to satisfy in later life, taking a powerful
telescope with him on his country rambles. Confession of sexual longings as
well as of impotence are a feature of the innumerable letters he wrote to
friends like Ralph and Frances Partridge, David Garnett, Sir Victor
Pritchett. Gathorne-Hardy suggests that it may ultimately be as a
letter-writer that Gerald will be best remembered.
Fortunately the marriage to Gamel, both of them writing and translating in
their Spanish home near Malaga, worked well for many years. They were there
when the Civil War started. In an effort to understand what was happening
Gerald then began work on one of his finest books, The Spanish Labyrinth.
Gerald's sexual drive lasted well into old age. He developed a brief -
unfulfilled - incestuous passion for his daughter Miranda. After she was
whisked away and safely married to a French doctor, Gerald suffered another
seismic sexual upheaval through the appearance of a new-generation
Carrington, Joanna, daughter of Carrington's brother Noel.
After she had left, he installed other girl-friends to help him with his
work, to the chagrin of Gamel. Shortly after her horrific death from cancer
we find Gerald, now a chirpy 74, setting up house with Lynda, a pretty woman
in her late twenties, with whom he is writing a biography of St John of the
Cross. She continues to be his companion and minder for the next 16 years,
even after her own marriage. We have here an account of a household
consisting of her, her Swedish artist-husband Lars, her two children and
Gerald, a menage as extraordinary in its way as anything chez Lytton and
Carrington.
We also have some pleasant close-ups during this period of Gerald delighting
his friends in bookish talk, vying with the likes of Cyril Connolly.
Gathorne-Hardy himself enters the picture at this point as a welcome guest
of Gerald and Lynda's. But these occasional personal memories, often
confined to footnotes of which Gathorne-Hardy is obsessionally fond, do not
impair the writer's detachment in this rich portrait of a maddeningly
devious, brilliantly courageous, literary man.

   Since September, when Gill's article was published, the war has
raged between those who believe him and those who say Campbell was
innocent. Gill is unyielding: ``When he became a conspicuous public
figure and got a response of millions of people, then I had to take
up arms against him.''
   It is not clear that his efforts to alter Campbell's reputation
have had much effect. ``There's still an extraordinary interest in
his point of view. Sales have been excellent on the Campbell book
(`The Power of Myth') for the past four months,'' said Stuart
Applebaum, a spokesman for Bantam Books.
   Campbell, of course, is not around to defend himself; he has
been dead more than two years. Most biographers do not have living
subjects to contend with, and the dead cannot be libeled.
   But when Ian Hamilton attempted to write a biography of J.D.
Salinger, he found that the reclusive writer was very much alive
and willing to fight back.
   Salinger took Hamilton to court to prevent him from quoting from
his private letters, which he had copyrighted. Salinger won, and
Hamilton was reduced to writing a book about how he tried to write
a Salinger biography.
   Surviving relatives of cultural figures can be divided into
three camps.
   Some cooperate with biographers. Some have become biographers
themselves: When novelist and short story writer John Cheever died,
his daughter, Susan, disclosed his alcoholism and homosexuality in
a memoir, ``Home Before Dark.''
   ``I did it out of anguish and love,'' she said.
   Cheever's son, Ben, published his father's letters (including
sexually explicit love letters to men and women) and is preparing a
volume of his father's journals.
   But other survivors are reticent, and some are angry. Stephen
Joyce, grandson of James and Nora Joyce, was angered by Brenda
Maddox's use of a sexually explicit correspondence between the
Joyces in her book ``Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom.''
   Stephen Joyce destroyed letters he had received from his aunt
Lucia _ James Joyce's daughter, who spent time in a mental
institution _ and letters from playwright Samuel Beckett to Lucia.
Beckett had requested that his letters be destroyed; the rest were
destroyed to guard his aunt's privacy.
   ``I firmly believe that there is a part of every man or woman's
life, no matter how famous he or she may be, that should remain
private,'' Stephen Joyce wrote in a letter to The New York Times.
``Furthermore, I believe that the Joyce family's privacy has been
invaded more than that of any other writer in this century. Enough
is enough, even too much.''
   Writing in the Times, Janna Malamud Smith, daughter of novelist
and short story writer Bernard Malamud, said her family might burn
her father's papers.
   Biographers, she said, ``can extract a high and often hidden
price in exchange for satisfying our curiosity. Too often readers
end up with theories about Hemingway's identity confusion or
alcohol abuse, but lose their pleasure in his fiction. Some mystery
about the writer helps maintain the work. I remember how much my
father enjoyed knowing little about Shakespeare's life, relishing
the untethered quality that absence conferred upon his plays.''
   But Goldman says biography should not affect how we look at art:
``A biographer is concerned with the man _ a critic is concerned
with the art.'' Nor will Americans be culturally bereft if they
find their idols have feet of clay, says Kazin: ``If we had any
culture in America, it would be harder.''
   Mencken did not destroy his diaries. He placed them in the Enoch
Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, to be sealed for 25 years after
his death, and then to be opened to ``students engaged in critical
or historical investigation.'' He did not mention publication; the
trustees debated the issue before going ahead.
   The book is mostly a list of Mencken's daily doings, mixed with
a few observations about people and events and the complaints of a
notorious hypochondriac. Just a few words are objectionable:
``kikes'' and ``shrewd Jew'' and ``linthead,'' among them.
   The editor, Charles A. Fecher, says the diaries prove Mencken
was an anti-Semite and felt that blacks were inferiors. The
revelations led the National Press Club to consider renaming the
Mencken Memorial Library, and induced the winner of an award named
after Mencken to refuse the honor.
   But New York Times columnist Russell Baker, who knew Mencken
from his early days at The Sun in Baltimore, noted that there is no
evidence that Mencken ever acted in a bigoted way. The diary
entries were ``night faults,'' Baker said.
   Others argue that the offensive jottings were more reflective of
Mencken's times _ an era when words like ``kikes'' and ``hunkies''
and ``wops'' were the stuff of conversation _ than of Mencken
himself.
   What would Mencken have said? Should a man's private musings
affect the way his public accomplishments are regarded? ``The
public ... demands certainties. It must be told definitely and a
bit raucously that this is true and that is false. But there are no
certainties,'' he once wrote.
   But he also wrote: ``Nothing can come out of an artist that is
not in the man.''

   NEW YORK -- Basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson signed
a three-book deal with Random House, reportedly valued at $5
million.
   Since Mr. Johnson's announcement last month that he has
contracted the AIDS virus, he's been hotly pursued by a
number of publishers interested in his autobiography. Random
House, a division of the Newhouse family's Advance
Publications Inc., said it will publish Mr. Johnson's
autobiography by next fall, as well as two other books.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Random House said the second book, set for this spring,
will be a paperback guide to "responsible sexual behavior,"
co-written by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. All
proceeds from the safe-sex guide will go to the just-formed
Magic Johnson Foundation, the publisher said.
   Random House said the contents of the third book "will be
determined at a future time."
   The $5 million advance is one of the largest book advances
paid in recent years; Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf was recently
paid $5 million for his memoirs alone. Random House is
betting that there will still be widespread interest in Mr.
Johnson's autobiography even though a biography appeared just
two years ago, and two "instant" biographies including the
disclosure of his illness just appeared.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: More words on Woolf - But Anthony Curtis finds that
this overview avoids overkill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
VIRGINIA WOOLF by James King Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 699 pages
It may not seem like it to those readers suffering from Bloomsbury bulimia,
but as James King, professor of English at McMaster University, Ontario, is
at pains to point out, this is the first full-scale biography of Virginia
Woolf since the one by Quentin Bell in 1972.
The years that followed Bell's sparely written life of his aunt saw the
publication of the five volumes of her diaries and the six volumes of her
letters. Then Andrew McNeillie began to edit a complete edition of the
essays of Virginia Woolf (including all her scattered book-reviews, many of
which were originally anonymous). With the appearance recently of Volume 4
(The Hogarth Press, Pounds 35.00) this edition has reached the year 1928.
Two more volumes will take it up to Woolf's death in 1941.
Thus the millions of words she wrote both privately and professionally
during her tragically curtailed lifetime are now all in the public domain.
Even the laconic diary she kept at Asheham in Sussex in 1917-18 before the
move to Rodmell, hitherto only partially printed in Volume 1 of the diaries,
is now available in full in the current number of The Charleston Magazine
(Issue 9, available from Charleston Farmhouse, Firle, Lewes, BN8 6LL at
Pounds 2.95).
Faced by such a mass of primary material - not to mention all the secondary
and related sources that have mushroomed - an overview of the writer, the
self-destructive drives that accompanied her endless literary creativity,
her ironical exposure of the injustices perpetrated upon women, is surely
much to be welcomed. King has avoided over-kill and organised his book
judiciously. He uncovers the autobiographical elements in the works while
integrating his subject's development as an artist with the many intense
relations she had with other people.
These relations form a set of concentric circles - first the family ones
including female cousins like Madge Vaughan and older women like Violet
Dickinson, to whom as a girl Virginia was very close. Then the men, her
brother Thoby's Cambridge contemporaries who became Bloomsbury, including
Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf. Finally, a wider circle of writers and
artists like Katherine Mansfield, Vita Sackville-West, TS Eliot, Hugh
Walpole who were not part of Bloomsbury but whom she came to know intimately
as her fame spread.
King is a sensitive scholar who leads us patiently through a richly varied
life with fresh insights to offer about episodes familiar from earlier
accounts. The least judgmental of biographers, he cannot avoid presenting
Virginia's half-brothers, George and Gerald Duckworth, as the villains of
this Cinderella-like story. We have her word - in papers she wrote and read
to the Memoir Club, a small private society within Bloomsbury - that she was
abused sexually by both of them: by Gerald when she was six who fondled her
and by George, who tried to rape her in her bedroom after a dance.
The precise extent of the abuse remains obscure. One should remember that
Woolf was capable of fantasising - as in one spectacular instance after
Thoby's death; she pretended to Violet that he was still alive sending her
details of the improvement in his condition. But even without the activities
of the half-brothers Duckworth (Gerald was to become the publisher of her
first novel) she suffered a series of bereavements when she was growing up
that were in themselves more than enough to de-stabilise her finely poised
mind.
Her mother Julia's death in 1895 at the age of 49 was followed two years
later by that of her half-sister Stella, who had assumed the maternal role
in the family. Virginia was 15. Her tyrannical but lovable father Leslie
Stephen died in 1904 when she was 22; her brother Thoby died aged 26 in
1906; and her nephew Julian Bell was killed in the Spanish Civil War.
Her recovery from her breakdowns, to the point where she could write her
novels and reviews and even re-create the process of losing control of
reality in the character of Septimus Warren Smith, was a minor miracle.
Though innately anti-Semitic she found her personal salvation through
marrying Leonard Woolf, a Jew, who gave up a very un-Jewish kind of career
in the Ceylon Civil Service where he was rising meteorically up the
administrative ladder. He became instead a writer and a devoted husband. Her
lesbian tendency was already apparent and marriage did not eliminate it.
Marital sex was another of Leonard's sacrifices.
The marriage survived an endless series of upheavals, including Virginia's
intense sense of rivalry with other women authors, notably Katherine
Mansfield, and with her sister Vanessa with whose husband, Clive Bell, she
flirted outrageously, precipitating Vanessa's lifelong passion for the
homosexual painter Duncan Grant.
When Viriginia was 43 she entered upon her passionate friendship with Vita.
This did not become a long, full-blooded affair, like those Vita had with
Hilda Matheson and Gwen St Aubyn. According to King they only slept together
twice but afterwards remained firm friends. Orlando was as much a requiem as
a celebration.
The composer Ethel Smyth, another attachment, sends a breath of irreverent
fresh air through this hothouse informing Virginia that she hated everything
Bloomsbury stood for. VW's ups-and-downs in her relations with all her
friends were mirrored in her attitude to her work. She see-sawed
bewilderingly between exaltation and utter despair and was over-sensitive to
reviews and verbal criticism.
After King's thorough biography, which inevitably concludes with her suicide
in 1941 as the threat of Nazi invasion loomed, we will not need another life
of Virginia Woolf for some time to come.

In reference to Richard Eder's review of "Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography" by 
Dierdre Bair (Book Review, April 15), Mr. Eder writes of Sartre's final years: 
"Old and ill, he gave a series of interviews to Benny Levy, a young Maoist 
adept whom many of the old Sartrians saw as an evil genius, in which he notably 
reversed the existentialist notion of the autonomous man." What was Beauvoir's 
reaction to such goings on? 
</P>
<P>
Again, Eder according to Bair: "Beauvoir wept tears of rage when she read the 
manuscript. For her, the ideas she and Sartre had worked on were her life. For 
him, they were a corset that made him look stiff and old." 
</P>
<P>
I have to question, or at least wonder about, Ms. Bair's scholarship when I 
compare the above with the first volume of John Gerassi's biography of Sartre, 
"Jean-Paul Sartre: Hated Conscience of His Century." Gerassi, the authorized 
biographer of Sartre and friend to both Sartre and Beauvoir, writes, " 'Tell 
me, Sartre,' I asked him in 1979 during one of his rare moments of lucidity, 
'is it true that you have renounced the dialectic and found God?' He exploded 
in his famous guttural laughter. 'I tell them what they want to hear . . . but 
don't you print that until they have all published their new analyses. Think 
carefully, Gerassi. Right now, as France turns far right, all these 
opportunists will go with it. For the foreseeable future, they are the future.' 
" And Sartre concludes, "All I want out of the future, whatever of it there is, 
is to be read." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing that Sartre and Beauvoir were as close as any two people have ever been, 
I find it hard to believe that she was not let in on his little scheme. As for 
the rest of the book's scholarship, who knows? I just know that I won't be 
reading a book that doesn't even bother to look behind what are seemingly the 
most complete changes of opinion taken by any philosopher at any time in 
history.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Biographia Trollopiana - The latest life of a
Victorian writer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT BLAKE

<TEXT>
TROLLOPE by Victoria Glendinning Hutchinson Pounds 20, 551 pages
IN AN ideal world there would be some sort of central mart of exchange to
which biographers could apply for information about who else was working on
the same subject. This would be particularly helpful when the relevant
sources were in the public domain.
Official biographers who are given first and exclusive access to a person's
papers are in a different situation. Their work cannot be pre-empted. They
may or may not produce books worth reading, but at least there is no danger
of being forestalled. When Lord Beaverbrook invited me in 1950 to write the
life of Bonar Law, whose papers he owned, I felt safe on that score - if not
on others.
I was in a more perilous situation in 1958 when I decided, unprompted, to
embark on a biography of Disraeli, whose official life had been completed in
1920 and whose papers had been open to inspection for many years, though in
physically daunting conditions. I saw no way of ascertaining what might be
in the pipeline and resolved to take a risk, but I was momentarily dismayed
when a US professor published a book on Disraeli's youth which anticipated a
discovery I thought I had made about Disraeli's early sexual imbroglios.
Luckily for me the book was by a toiler in what Paul Johnson has described
as the 'Eng. Lit. Crit. Industry', and therefore unreadable.
These personal reflections are prompted by the remarkable outburst of
Biographia Trollopiana which has occurred in the last four years. When
Victoria Glendinning began her research in 1988 she had no idea that three
other authors - all of them American, as it happens - were busy in the same
field and had been for several years. The last serious life of Trollope, by
James Pope-Hennessy, had appeared in 1971.
There is no obvious reason for the revival of interest, no centenary or
other significant date, yet the appearance of four biographies, of which
this is the latest, coincides with the foundation of the Trollope Society of
London and New York which is publishing a uniform edition of the novels. It
also coincides with the placing of a memorial in Poets Corner in Westminster
Abbey and with a Prime Minister who is a Trollope fan (not the first to be)
and who took for holiday reading, no doubt as a relaxation from perusal of
the Treaty of Maastricht, The Small House at Allington, which Victoria
Glendinning, if she had to make a choice, would place among the seven best
of all the novels.
I have read only one of the three earlier biographies, Richard Mullen's
Anthony Trollope, A Victorian In His World (Duckworth 1990). Reviewing it
for the Financial Times I described it as 'a great literary biography, one
of the best to appear in recent times. It is unlikely ever to be
superseded'. I would stand by that verdict. Victoria Glendinning has not
superseded Mullen, nor has she made any such claim. What she has done is to
write a perceptive and sensitive study of Trollope's life and writings from
a slightly different angle.
Mullen saw the key to Trollope in his desire to be respected not only as a
novelist but as a serious writer who wanted to influence public life. Hence
the importance of his non-fiction works and, apart from those, his important
role as a Post Office official - inventor of the pillar box - and his
unhappy foray into politics when he stood in 1868 as an unsuccessful Liberal
candidate for the infinitely corrupt seat of Beverley.
Mullen saw Trollope's travel books and articles on British and US politics
as 'the best portrayal of his personality . . . I see his non-fiction as the
key to his fiction.' There is a great deal in this interpretation and
Richard Mullen's use of the travel books and his full analysis of the
affairs of the Victorian Post Office are very illuminating.
Victoria Glendinning's emphasis is rather different. She sees him as a man
with an outer and an inner life. Behind the bluff, noisy, seemingly
extrovert clubman, raconteur and shrewd man of business, there was a highly
emotional person who understood affairs of the heart, the ways of men and
women, the balance of power between the sexes in and out of marriage, with
an acumen unrivalled among the Victorian novelists.
She does not underplay his public life but emphasises that it was balanced
by another aspect, and she makes full use of his novels and autobiography to
explain it. The publishers make something of the first biography of Trollope
by a woman and Glendinning seems to believe that his wife Rose has been
neglected by previous writers. These matters of 'gender' can be overdone. In
fact there is just as much, if not more, about Rose in Richard Mullen's
book.
Trollopians should have both these biographies on their bookshelves, but if
they have space or money for only one I would, at the risk of the charge of
male chauvinism, advise Mullen's. His book is longer by 200 pages, more
scholarly in terms of notes and index, and equally well written. The major
sources in both books are the same and inevitably there is a great deal of
overlap.
It was brave of Victoria Glendinning to go ahead in the knowledge of these
forthcoming works but Trollope admirers will be glad that she did. Whether
the market can sustain four biographies of the same person in four years is
another matter. That is something for authors and publishers - especially
the latter - to consider, not for reviewers.
The Collected Shorter Fiction of Anthony Trollope, containing 42 short
stories, edited by Julian Thompson, will be published next month by Robinson
Publishing (Pounds 25, 959 pages)
