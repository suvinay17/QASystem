   The popular belief that President Woodrow
Wilson's wife ran the government after her husband's devastating
stroke in 1919 is ``pure nonsense,'' according to a historian at
Princeton University.
   History Professor Arthur Link, editor of a series of volumes of
Wilson's papers, said the 64th volume, to be published in February,
will prove that Mrs. Wilson served as a liaison but was not
effectively an ``acting president'' in Wilson's final year in
office.
   The volume quotes medical records and journals kept by Dr. Cary
T. Grayson, Wilson's personal physician and confidant. Grayson's
sons allowed Link to review the 70-year-old records in May.
   ``It is a popular belief, but it has gotten more into the realm
of legend than scholarship,'' said Link.
   Edith Wilson did make two crucial decisions following Wilson's
stroke, Link said. She covered up the extent of Wilson's illness
and thwarted suggestions that he resign.
   Link said Mrs. Wilson long denied being an acting president and
once told him she was ``never interested in politics.''
   Grayson's journals show that Mrs. Wilson served as a liaison
between Wilson and his advisers, but that the government was run by
his department heads, Link said.
   Wilson was president from 1913 to 1921. He suffered the stroke
in October 1919, never fully recovered, and died in 1924.

BROTHER WOODROW: A MEMOIR OF WOODROW WILSON by Stockton Axson, edited by
Arthur S. Link Princeton University Press, 297 pages
It is hard to remember that in 1918-19 Woodrow Wilson was the toast of
Europe. Streets, boulevards and squares were renamed in his honour. Even the
defeated Germans pinned their hopes to the American president's 'Fourteen
Points'. After decades of intense and acrimonious debate, Wilson is now
mainly of interest to the academic establishment. This unique portrait of
the president, written by his brother-in-law and friend of 40 years, is of
general interest and should appeal to anyone interested in the 'human side'
of American politics.
It is a warm and affectionate yet frank and critical study of a reserved and
introverted man. This collection of descriptive, anecdotal and analytic
essays is brilliantly edited and annotated by the doyen of Woodrow Wilson
studies, Arthur Link. What makes the Axson memoir so important is not only
the sense of intimacy conveyed by one of the very few of Wilson's
contemporaries in whom this reticent man confided but the sharpness of
insight shown by the author, a life-long bachelor suffering from recurrent
bouts of depression and who lived on and off in the Wilson household.
Wilson was mentor, friend and companion to his younger brother-in-law. The
affection between them was deep and long-lasting. The highlight of the book
is the account of Wilson's presidency of Princeton University and his battle
to reform not only its curriculum and lecture system but the special
position of the socially devisive Princeton 'dining clubs' still in
existence today.
Axson was professor of English at Princeton during this time and his essay
is the best and fullest record we have of this key moment in Wilson's
pre-political life. In the ensuing campus battle, Wilson showed many of
those same traits that made him one of the great American presidents but led
to his ultimate defeat over the League of Nations, for which he had
sacrificed so much.
A natural leader, highly intelligent and administratively gifted, Wilson was
also dogmatic, stubborn and inflexible. At the height of the Princeton
conflict, passionately engaged in the pursuit of his educational goals, the
university president rejected any possibility of compromise and turned his
back on colleagues who opposed him. Wilson proved insufficiently politic to
complete his reform programme, too unwilling to take advice and too aloof
from his colleagues to outplay his conservative opposition.
As Axson describes his own and others' efforts to moderate Wilson's
unyielding approach, one has a foretaste of what happened in Washington in
1919.
Wilson has been a favourite subject for the psycho-biographers. Axson's
study of the president's father and his picture of Wilson's familial life is
as, if not more, perceptive than the best of these accounts. Axson's shrewd
character studies of Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan and other
contemporary politicians, his evocation of key political events, many of
which he witnessed, and the rich collection of personal and political
stories, comical as well as serious, convey a sense of immediacy no
historian can match. The fond but sharp assessment of Wilson's personality
in a final chapter is a beautiful piece of writing that seems to catch the
essence of a strangely elusive man.
There are few personal memoirs of Wilson; this is an exceptionally rich one.
To have such a valuable addition to the vast corpus of Wilsoniana, presented
in such a handsome and well-illustrated volume, is double bonus for the
reader.

<HEAD>Records Show Wilson Weakened By Disease During League of Nations

   President Woodrow Wilson's behavior was
affected by decreased blood flow to the brain during his
oft-criticized and ultimately futile campaign to have the United
States join the League of Nations, a historian says.
   Records that were never made public show that Wilson was
disabled by illness during the critical period in U.S. history
after World War I, said Princeton University history Professor
Arthur Link, editor of a series of volumes of Wilson's papers.
   ``It is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century,'' Link
said in a recent interview. ``The man who was most responsible for
building support for the idea of a League of Nations was struck
down just as his leadership was most needed. And he was struck down
by events over which he had no control.''
   The 64th volume in the series, to be published in February, will
reveal for the first time detailed medical records kept by Dr. Cary
T. Grayson, Wilson's personal physician. Grayson's sons allowed
Link to review the 70-year-old papers in May.
   Link said the records, with analysis by medical experts, explain
Wilson's poor performance in the months leading up to his
devastating stroke in October 1919.
   Wilson, a Democrat, was president from 1913 to 1921. He died in
1924.
   He won the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his peacemaking efforts
involving the League of Nations after World War I. However, he
failed to win U.S. support for the League, which fell apart before
World War II.
   Link said U.S. entry into the League of Nations could have
altered history.
   ``In a world with the United States playing a responsible,
active role, the possibilities of preventing the rise of Hitler
were limitless,'' Link said.
   Wilson failed to get the Senate to ratify U.S. membership in the
league because of what Link said was an uncharacteristic
unwillingness to compromise. The Senate wanted guarantees that the
United States would not be subordinate to the votes of other
nations in case of war.
   ``In his normal, healthy state, Wilson would have found
compromise with the large group of moderate Republicans,'' said
Link.
   Instead, Wilson was robbed of ``his ability at leadership, of
his normal shrewdness and deftness, of his marvelous management
skills,'' said Link. ``He would lose his train of thought, and get
confused. He would contradict himself, and eventually, blow his
cool.''
   Against medical advice, Wilson, then 63, took his message
directly to the people with a speaking tour of Western states in
September 1919. The decision to go over the Senate's head angered
the very lawmakers Wilson needed to court.
   ``The decision ... was not only irrational but in the
circumstances was bound to be futile,'' Link writes in the
forthcoming book.
   Dr. James F. Toole, director of the Stroke Center of the Bowman
Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Dr. Bert E.
Park, a Springfield, Mo. neurosurgeon, analyzed the medical records
for Link's book.
   Toole wrote that the records indicate Wilson suffered from a
disease of the carotid arteries in the neck, which hindered blood
flow to the brain, and hypertension, which worsened his condition.
   Park wrote that Wilson likely continued to suffer episodes of
internal bleeding following a 1906 stroke. This could cause injury
leading ``in time to recognizable behavioral disturbances that
typified Wilson from late 1919 onward,'' Park wrote.
   Link said the records should lay to rest the theories that
Wilson's problems were psychological.
   ``His failure in leadership instead derived from the ravages of
disease,'' Link said. ``History has judged Wilson as if he were a
well man during this period.''

   WASHINGTON -- David Bradford, a professor of economics at
the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, is the
leading candidate to become a member of President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers.
   According to Bush administration officials, Mr. Bradford
is the likely successor for Richard Schmalensee, who will
leave the council this summer to return to his teaching job
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bradford, a Treasury Department official in the Ford
administration, is best known in Washington for his work on
Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform, a Treasury document that
helped lay the seeds for the 1986 tax overhaul. He has
written extensively about taxes and advocates a system that
would tax consumption rather than income.
   Like Michael Boskin, chairman of the three-member Council
of Economic Advisers, Mr. Bradford earned his Ph.D. at
Stanford University in 1966. In addition to his work on
taxation, he has also been involved in attempts to apply
cost-benefit analysis to a wide range of government policies.
   Mr. Bradford is an associate dean, as well as a professor
of economics and public affairs, at the Woodrow Wilson
school.
   Mr. Bradford couldn't be reached for comment.

   President Reagan laughed when he was asked
about prospects for winning the Nobel Peace Prize, but aides in the
White House had their fingers crossed in hopes Thursday's award
will cement the president's place in history as a peacemaker.
   ``I'm superstitious _ since one hand is crossed the other one
can't be, because it would cancel the other out,'' quipped Nancy
Reagan's spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev have been
mentioned as top contenders for the $390,000 prize because of their
efforts in reaching the first superpower treaty banning an entire
class of nuclear weapons. According to the Nobel committee in Oslo,
which will announce the winner Thursday, 97 individuals and
organizations were candidates for the peace prize this year.
   The first lady long has been rumored to be the White House
resident most interested in seeing her husband crown his eight-year
presidency with one of the world's most prestigious awards.
   But Mrs. Crispen pooh-poohed the idea that Mrs. Reagan was
anxious for her husband to receive the golden medal, saying the
first lady's ``never said a word about it.'' And even if such an
honor didn't come his way, the couple wouldn't be disappointed,
Mrs. Crispen predicted.
   ``Going through elections and such, they're always set for
things to go one way or another. They are very realistic about
winning and losing,'' she said.
   When reporters queried Reagan about his prospects last week
during a visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
the president and his visitor broke out in big smiles and laughed.
   While Reagan said nothing, Shevardnadze quipped that it might be
``a good possibility'' that his Soviet boss and Reagan might meet
once again if they were to go to Oslo to receive the award.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no one in the
executive mansion has had any advance information on the
announcement.
   ``No one knows what will happen, it's not the sort of thing you
can anticipate, but it would be wonderful for the president if he
won,'' Fitzwater said.
   If Reagan were to win, he'd be the third U.S. president to do so.
   President Theodore Roosevelt was the first American to win the
award, receiving it in 1906 for his diplomacy in ending the
conflict between Russia and Japan.
   President Woodrow Wilson was granted the medallion for his
peacemaking efforts involving the League of Nations after World War
I.
   Any chief executive is reminded of the benchmark set by earlier
presidents, since Roosevelt's medal is on display across the hall
from the Oval Office in the Roosevelt Room.
   The 2{-inch golden medallion, encased in a 14-inch high
plexiglass cube, shimmers in a special spotlight on the mantel for
all to see.
   Wilson's medal is now in the possession of the Library of
Congress and will be placed on display at the Woodrow Wilson House
in November and December in observance of Armistice Day.
   Wilson's prize was bestowed in 1920 after he failed to win U.S.
support for his beloved League of Nations, ``and he felt very
vindicated by the peace prize,'' said Patricia Sullivan, the
director of the museum at the Wilson House.
   The Washington mansion was where the gravely ill president spent
his last days in virtual seclusion.
   Some think Reagan doesn't deserve the prize because of his
support for the Nicaraguan Contras in their war against the
Sandinista government.
   And Roosevelt, in his time, was viewed by many as the antithesis
of the peacemaker.
   ``The prize seems somewhat anomalous, inasmuch as it was awarded
to an outspoken advocate of armed force and a scourge of
pacifism,'' wrote John Milton Cooper Jr. in his study of Roosevelt
and Wilson, ``The Warrior and the Priest.''
   ``Yet it was not anomalous. The policies Roosevelt pursued in
the Far East and Europe were aimed at averting or containing
conflicts among the great powers and promoting international
stability. Behind both the appearance and the reality of his public
stances, the president lead an almost secret life as a sensitive,
subtle diplomat,'' Cooper said.

   British politician Neil Kinnock tried to sweep his
colleagues off their feet Wednesday when he serenaded them with a
vacuum cleaner in the House of Commons.
   The opposition Labor Party leader played a few notes on the
vacuum cleaner at a news conference to promote a summer concert
series in Wales, which will include a piece with the familiar
domestic device.
   The vacuum will be featured at a July 22 fthe past three decades marked
the golden anniversary by
quietly sketching another adventure.
   ``It's just another day for me,'' said Curtis Swan, 68, who has
been drawing Superman since the mid-1950s.
   Swan, who prefers anonymity to adulation, said he is amazed that
the cartoon character's popularity has sustained and even grown
over the years.
   He also said he plans to keep drawing.
   ``I'm never going to retire. I want to keep those fires
burning,'' he said. ``Discipline and work is what keeps you
going,'' Swan said Monday, Superman's 50th anniversary.
   Several years ago, DC Comics decided to revamp Superman's
character for the 1980s.
   ``They are trying now to make Superman vulnerable to certain
things, to work out his problems on a mental basis without
muscle,'' Swan said.
   ``They (the editors) are trying to show that Superman has his
limitations. He's more intimate with the ladies, especially Lois
Lane, and Clark Kent is more of a Yuppie ...''

   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker is going back to school _ as a professor.
   Volcker was named Wednesday to a professor's post at Princeton
University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs.
   He was graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School in 1949 and is
the first incumbent of the Frederic H. Schultz Class of 1951
Professorship of International Economic Policy.
   ``I'm somewhat intimidated by the fact that I'm having to go
back and do a little teaching. I'm hoping for a little assistance
to help me through those early stages,'' Volcker said.
   The former Fed chief, whose ambitions had remained unclear
following his departure from the job last August, said he declined
professor offers from other universities, including Harvard, where
he received a master's in political economy in 1951.
   ``I felt comfortable (at Princton). The school combines my
interest in the public service and in economic policy.''
   Volcker said he has not severed ties with Wall Street and that
his business connections will prevent him from teaching full time
at Princeton.
   During the 1988-89 academic year he plans to teach both
semesters at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

<HEAD>Woodrow Wilson's Name Restored on Prague Train Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-two years after Communists
removed Woodrow Wilson's name from Prague's main train station, the
government restored it today, in honor of President Bush's visit.
   Bush's one-day visit to Prague on Saturday, the first by a U.S.
president, coincides with the first anniversary of Czechoslovakia's
``Velvet Revolution.'' The term describes the mass street protests
that ended 40 years of Communist rule and restored democracy with
former dissident Vaclav Havel as president.
   Wilson's government was a leading supporter of Czech and Slovak
independence from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He recognized the
sovereignty of a de facto government set up by Tomas G. Masaryk in
U.S. exile before the two peoples joined as an independent
Czechoslovakia in 1918.
   Masaryk became Czechoslovakia's first president that year.
Wilson's support of Czechoslovak independence established warm
relations between the two nations and Prague's main train station,
a glass-domed building near central Wenceslas Square, was named
after Wilson to thank him.
   After the Communists took power in 1948, Wilson's name was
dropped and the terminal became simply the Main Station.
   Prague Mayor Jaroslav Koran said at a brief ceremony today that
``Wilson's station never stopped being Wilson's station...even when
frightened (Communist) rulers tried to wipe out'' the reference.
   ``Wilson has returned to Prague, where he always belonged, but
never visited,'' Koran said, adding that Bush's visit would
``complete the magic circle. As if with a message from our
ancestors, the president will visit for the first time ever.''
   U.S. Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, outlining the special
relationship between Wilson and Masaryk, said the station was
originally named after Wilson to show the recognition of
Czechoslovakia as a world country.''
   Bush is returning a visit made to the United States by Havel in
February. He was the first Czechoslovak president to visit America
officially.
   After the Czech lands were occupied by Hitler's army in 1939,
President Eduard Benes made a private visit to the United States
from exile in Britain. During the Communist era, America was viewed
as a beacon of freedom, and Czechoslovaks' unabated warm feelings
toward the United States are evident on the eve of Bush's visit.
   A simple white plaque unveiled at the ceremony bears a
photograph of Wilson and the inscription, ``On the occasion of the
first visit of an American president to Czechoslovakia, this
station has been renamed the Woodrow Wilson Station.''
   A 71-year-old woman was clearly pleased with the formal
renaming.
   ``That is what it was during the first republic and we are
comfortable with it,'' she said.

FIRST LADIES GET CORNER SPOT IN HISTORY

Presidents get their own libraries. John Kennedy's overlooks Boston Harbor. 
Franklin Roosevelt's overlooks the Hudson River. Ronald Reagan wanted his at 
Stanford University, but he had to settle for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And presidential wives? They get a corner in the Cerritos Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the only municipal book depository in the country 
dedicated to the nation's First Ladies and containing a First Ladies 
Collection. The section was created at the behest of local women, who insisted 
that the library, built in 1973, memorialize the contributions of women to 
community life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Enquirer Clippings 
</P>
<P>
Forget that much of the archival material -- most notably that about Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis -- consists of clippings from the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that under a picture of Mary Harrison someone put the date of her death 
as four years before she married Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
In Cerritos one can quickly find out what kind of woman married Calvin Coolidge 
-- a man so aloof that humorist Dorothy Parker, upon learning he was dead, 
quipped, "How can they tell?" 
</P>
<P>
Grace Coolidge, according to her biographer, was a "lively extrovert" and a 
teacher of deaf children who as First Lady became their spokeswoman and helped 
secure them a right to education. 
</P>
<P>
In Cerritos you can find out almost as quickly which of the nation's First 
Ladies had a degree in geology and spoke Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of five languages spoken by Lou Henry Hoover, who met her 
mining-engineer husband, Herbert, at Stanford University and after their 
marriage followed him to China where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
Want to know how Presidents romanced First Ladies? Look to the collection for 
two books of love letters by Woodrow Wilson -- to first wife, Ellen, and second 
wife, Edith. Wilson called both of them "my own darling." 
</P>
<P>
Soap opera writers in search of new material can check out "Cannibals of the 
Heart," a title that at least sounds more titillating than the "The Guiding 
Light." 
</P>
<P>
"Cannibals" chronicles the "Who's-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf"-like marriage of 
John Quincy Adams and wife, Louisa, whose sense of identity within the 
illustrious Adams family was so fragile that she titled her diary "The 
Adventures of a Nobody" and once suggested that "hanging and marriage" were a 
lot alike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accommodations to History 
</P>
<P>
The First Ladies Committee of the Friends of the Cerritos Library realized, 
though, when it began hanging First Lady portraits on the library walls that it 
would have to make some accommodations to history. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents often had more than one wife so the committee decreed that its 
portrait gallery be open to all presidential wives, not just First Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery includes Rachael Jackson, the love of Andrew's life, who was buried 
in the gown she would have worn to the Inaugural Ball. She became ill and died 
before her husband could take the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential wives' designation also explains why Alice Roosevelt and 
Caroline Fillmore made it to the wall of the library, if not to the White 
House. Alice died 17 years before husband, Teddy, and his second wife, Edith, 
moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Caroline did not marry Millard Fillmore until 
five years after he and first wife, Abigail, who later died, moved out. But 
there is no picture yet of actress Jane Wyman, the first presidential ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Some friends of the library, said Annette Creasy, a founding member of the 
library auxiliary group, have privately pondered the Wyman issue. The group is 
sensitive, Creasy said, to rumors that there might be a "rift" between Reagan's 
first wife, Wyman, and Nancy Reagan. The issue, Creasy suggested, will probably 
be resolved after everyone involved is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The First Ladies collection -- 170 books, 41 gold-framed pictures, six 
scrapbooks of news clippings and memorabilia that includes a pale pink leather 
handbag that belonged to Mamie Eisenhower -- is a mother lode of First Family 
trivia. 
</P>
<P>
Among the books: "Dog Days at the White House: The Outrageous Memoirs of the 
Presidential Kennel Keeper." Among the news clippings: a story about Margaret 
Wilson, daughter of Woodrow. She moved to India and joined a religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Eisenhower's biography of mother Pat Nixon is in the book collection, 
along with a tell-all tome about her called the "Lonely Lady of San Clemente." 
For real First Lady pathos, though, read "The Insanity File." It is about Mary 
Todd Lincoln's commitment to an asylum in her later years. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nixon's tenure in the White House helped spur the city to dedicate its 
library to First Ladies. Richard Nixon's wife spent part of her high school 
days in Cerritos when it was still called Dairy Valley. And, until the 
Watergate scandal when an unknown arsonist burned it down, the house in which 
she lived stood in the South Street park named for her.

<HEAD>Volcker Named To Princeton Professorship, Chairman Of Banking Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tiny investment banker James D.
Wolfensohn Inc. has gotten a big name to hang out his shingle at
the firm: former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
   Volcker was named Wednesday as chairman of the New York-based
firm, and also as a professor at Princeton University.
   The announcements ended the months of speculation over Volcker's
next career move that followed his decision last year not to accept
another term at the Fed.
   Volcker's international reputation and widespread connections
stemming from his tenure at the central bank were highly prized by
Wall Street, and his decision to join Wolfensohn represents a coup
for the firm.
   Volcker, who served as director of the Federal Reserve from 1979
to 1987, ``brings great experience in the whole area of finance and
general economic matters,'' said James Wolfensohn, the firm's
founder, president and chief executive officer.
   ``He's a great negotiator and will help run client relations and
add to the breadth of the services we bring to our clients,''
Wolfensohn said.
   Wolfensohn said the six-year-old firm specializes in work with
major American and international companies and their strategies in
mergers and acquisitions.
   He said he has known Volcker for at least 10 years.
   Volcker, who graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs in 1949, is the first to hold the
school's Frederic H. Schultz Class of 1951 Professorship of
International Economic Policy.
   The Princeton post and the position with Wolfensohn are
effective immediately.
   At a news conference Wednesday morning in Princeton, Volcker
said he declined professorship offers from a number of other
universities, including Harvard, from which he received his
master's degree in political economy in 1951.
   ``I had discussions with a number of Ivy League and non-Ivy
League universities,'' he said. ``I think it is fair to say that
there was a certain pull here for my alma mater, though I have a
another alma mater in the Ivy League.
   ``I felt comfortable here. The school combines my interest in
the public service and in economic policy.''
   Volcker said he intends to spend the coming months at Princeton
meeting with graduate students and attending a faculty seminar on
international trade.
   ``I'm delighted to have the opportunity to get the kind of
intellectual stimulus you can get here and I hope to contribute a
little bit,'' he said. ``I'm somewhat intimidated by the fact that
I'm having to go back and do a little teaching. I'm hoping for a
little assistance to help me through those early stages.''
   During the 1988-89 academic year he plans to teach both
semesters at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

   Seventeen Americans served as state or
territorial governors before becoming president, although most also
held senior elected or appointed federal office before winning the
White House.
   The two most recent exceptions are Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan. Michael Dukakis hopes to become a third.
   The list of former governors who became president includes some
of the most distinguished chief executives and some who are
scarcely remembered.
   Thomas Jefferson, who was governor of Virginia during the
American Revolution, tops the list. Jefferson, the third president,
doubled the size of the nation by purchasing the Louisiana
territory from France in 1803.
   He had some training along the way, being principle author of
the Declaration of Independence, negotiating the peace treaty with
Great Britain, then serving as ambassador to France and secretary
of state.
   James Monroe, another Virginia governor, became the fifth
president after serving in the U.S. Senate, as envoy to France,
Britain and Spain, and as secretary of war and state.
   Andrew Jackson was territorial governor of Florida four years
after defeating the Seminole Indians in that state.
   His successor, Martin Van Buren, was governor of New York after
serving in the U.S. Senate, and was Jackson's secretary of state
and vice president.
   Other 19th century presidents who had been governors include
William Henry Harrison of Indiana, John Tyler of Virginia, James
Knox Polk and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, Rutherford B. Hayes of
Ohio, and Grover Cleveland of New York.
   William McKinley, the 25th president, was governor of Ohio for
1892-96.
   Theodore Roosevelt, who was vice president and took office after
McKinley's assassination, had been assistant Navy secretary before
resigning in 1897 to organize the Rough Riders in the
Spanish-American War. He was governor of New York for 1899-1901.
   Woodrow Wilson, who had graduate degrees in law and political
science, was president of Princeton University before serving as
governor of New Jersey in 1911-13. He was elected president in 1912
and invaded Mexico in 1914, the year that World War I began in
Europe. He was re-elected in 1916 with the slogan, ``He Kept Us Out
of War,'' but declared war on Germany the following year.
   Calvin Coolidge served as governor of Massachusetts for 1919-20
and for 1921-23 was vice president to Warren Harding, who died in
office.
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt was governor of New York for 1929-33,
after serving as assistant Navy Secretary in 1913-20, a post which
deeply involved him in diplomacy and logistics in World War I and
prepared him for his leadership role in World War II.
   Jimmy Carter served for one term as governor of Georgia before
his election as president in 1976.
   Ronald Reagan, a two-term California governor, defeated Carter
in 1980.

AMBUSH SHOOTING;

<P>
NURSE KILLED TRYING TO AID MAN ON STREET

<P>
A private nurse who stopped her car in the hills above Studio City and 
apparently got out to help a man lying in the street was fatally shot Wednesday 
when the man stood up and pulled a gun, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in the ambush killing of 40-year-old Lucille Marie Warren 
at Montcalm Avenue and Woodrow Wilson Drive in an exclusive neighborhood of 
hillside homes. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was shot at 6:45 a.m. while on her way home to Inglewood, police said. 
She had left a house on Montcalm where she worked as a night nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said there were indications that she was the specific target of 
the fatal attack and may even have known her killer. Detectives are 
investigating whether Warren, who was divorced and lived with her two teen-age 
children, was involved in any personal disputes that could have led to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't appear to be a random encounter," said homicide Detective Mike 
Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motive Unknown 
</P>
<P>
While the motive for the shooting was unknown, police said, the killer may have 
been in the street because he knew that Warren was approaching and would stop 
if she thought someone needed help. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a nurse," said Lt. Ron LaRue. "If you knew she was a nurse, you could 
find a way to make her stop. The suspect was lying in the street and she 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Warren had been working at the home in the Montcalm cul-de-sac at least two 
months, police said. Officials of a Van Nuys-based registry of nurses, through 
which police said Warren was referred to jobs, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives would not name the person for whom Warren worked. Los Angeles real 
estate records list the large, gated property where police said she cared for a 
patient as belonging to Miklos Rozsa, 81, a composer and three-time Academy 
Award winner for the musical scoring of films. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing her night's work, Warren was leaving the cul-de-sac when she 
stopped at Woodrow Wilson Drive after seeing the man in the middle of the 
street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gun Pulled From Clothing 
</P>
<P>
When Warren got out and walked toward the front of the car, the man stood up 
and pulled a handgun out of his clothing. Police said they do not know whether 
the pair spoke before the man fired several times at Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was hit by gunfire at least twice, including once in the head, and fell 
mortally wounded in the street, police said. One other shot hit the windshield 
of her car, which eventually rolled into an embankment on the other side of the 
street. Police said the gunman ran to a car parked nearby and sped away. The 
victim was not robbed. 
</P>
<P>
A resident called police on a car phone after seeing the woman in the street. 
Coffey said several residents saw parts of the crime and provided police with 
descriptions of the gunman, his car and the sequence of events. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where she died at 
10:48 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
As police cordoned off the area, residents gathered nearby or watched from 
their windows. Police said the shooting, which occurred near a corner house 
owned by artist David Hockney, was unusual in the quiet, affluent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Violence is getting common all over the city," said a man who declined to give 
his name. "People pay a lot of money to get away from it but it doesn't always 
work." 
</P>

<TEXT>
   Medical records confirmed today that a
former president of Brandeis Univesity and his wife were among four
Americans killed in last week's fire at a luxury hotel, a U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman said.
   Also today, a tourism official said the fire safety procedures
of all Cairo hotels will be reviewed.
   Seventeen people were killed in the hotel fire early Thursday at
the Heliopolis Sheraton, which started in a garden tent restaurant.
   Among the victims were Prof. Marver Bernstein, 71, a former
president of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. and his wife,
Sheva Rosenthal.
   Spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba of the U.S. Embassy said the couple's
dental and medical documents arrived today, providing positive
identification.
   Bernstein was dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs at Princeton University before becoming
president of Brandeis in 1972.
   In 1983 he joined Georgetown University's School of Foreign
Service, where he taught both politics and philosophy and
coordinated the school's American courses program.
   He retired last year but remained as a lecturer.
   Bernstein was born in Mankato, Minn.. He married Rosenthal, a
native of St. Paul, Minn., in 1943, the Washington Post said.
   Also today, officials said security systems at Cairo's hotels
and firefighting equipment would be reviewed. Hamdy el-Shamy of the
Tourism Ministry said there would be ``coordination to organize
regular checks.''
   He said most of Egypt's luxury hotels had tents similar to the
one that caught fire at the Sheraton and that they were legal.
Officials have charged that the Sheraton set up the tent illegally.
   Survivors of the Sheraton fire have said there was no sprinkler
system or fire alarm, but Sheraton officials have insisted an alarm
was sounded when the fire spread from the tent restaurant to the
hotel.
   Scores of brightly colored canvas tents decorate many of the
country's major hotels to create a Middle Eastern flavor in
nightclubs and restaurants. They are popular with Egyptians and
foreigners.
   About 2.4 million tourists visited Egypt in 1989, bringing in
$2.4 billion in revenue.

   Diving in the Think Tanks

   Think tanks have become one of the nation's biggest growth
industries in the past 30 years, and there are now more than
1,200 of them. They churn out an endless stream of books,
monographs and reports. Their resident fellows bombard the
nation's op-ed pages with instant wisdom and provide the
brainpower for endless presidential commissions. The bookers
at "MacNeil/Lehrer" and "Nightline" would be clueless if the
talking heads from the think tanks were somehow decapitated.
But is the nation better off with so many think tanks?
   That is the question James Allen Smith tackles in "The
Idea Brokers: Think Tanks and the Rise of the New Policy
Elite" (Macmillan/Free Press, 197 pages, $24.95). His answer
seems to be a reluctant no. But his criticism is couched in
wording so vague, bloodless and, yes, think-tank-like, that
no guru-in-residence need fear that the "government of
experts" that Woodrow Wilson -- himself an Ivy League
academic -- warned us against has been unmasked.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What Mr. Smith does do very well is to trace the origins
of think tanks to the progressive era's belief that
government would inevitably become too complex and large for
mere citizen-politicians to manage. "Experts" would be needed
to analyze the growing mass of economic data the government
was collecting. Other experts would then come up with
solutions to solve the problems quantified by that data.
Robert Ely, a founder of the American Economics Association,
summed up the views of the era nicely: "We regard the state
as an educational and ethical agency whose positive aid is an
indispensible condition of human progress." It only took a
few thousand Richard Ely's and several trillion dollars to
create the modern welfare state.
   Not too many people would still agree with Ely's naive
optimism, but most of those who do seem to work in the 100 or
so think tanks clustered inside the Washington Beltway. They
now dedicate their lives to explaining why yesterday's
solutions to such problems as slum clearance or farm
subsidies haven't worked out as advertised. But surely, they
say, tomorrow's solutions will.
   According to Mr. Smith, there has been a counterrevolution
of sorts in the think-tank world. Until about 20 years ago,
most think tanks masqueraded as nonpartisan groups of experts
who made sensible, open-minded recommendations that
conveniently always seemed to call for more government.
Disillusionment with government has created a raft of
conservative "advocacy tanks" to challenge the thinktank
conventional wisdom. Disgust with liberal bureaucracy has
fostered a number of left-wing think tanks, the most notable
being the Institute for Policy Studies, founded by two
defectors from John F. Kennedy's intellectual salon.
   But it is free-market groups such as the Heritage
Foundation and the Cato Institute that have turned think
tanks into savvy intellectual retailers. "Like a film run on
fast forward, they compressed and accelerated developments
that had taken place over many decades in the social
sciences, universities, and older policy-research
institutions," says Mr. Smith.
   Heritage prepares timely studies on major issues and
distributes them to what it says are the "6,000 people" it
thinks are the "only ones who count" on a given issue. Who
are these 6,000 mega-heavies? They include every member of
Congress, 1,500 of their staffers, 700 executive-branch
officials, 1,000 academics, 1,000 journalists and a few
hundred talk-show hosts.
   Mr. Smith says this is a far cry from what the business
and foundation backers of the first think tanks wanted. They
hoped the think tanks would serve to educate the public and
provide a value-free basis on which to judge the efficacy of
public policies. Instead, think tanks have helped experts
monopolize political debate in this country. "What are we
for," Woodrow Wilson once wrote, "if we are to be
scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen
who are the only men who understand the job?"
   The mind conjures up a vision of a think-tank future:
6,000 experts in an arena schmoozing the 6,000 key people
they seek to influence. The two groups babble at each other
constantly, while the general public is locked out, sullenly
wondering what is going on inside. "The idea of a `public
debate' on an issue is merely an anachronistic fiction,"
writes Mr. Smith.
   The premise of modern government is that the increasing
complexity of society requires expert analysis to comprehend
it and large bureaucracies and budgets to manage it. But this
very complexity means that top-down, think-tank solutions are
doomed to failure. How can a think-tank expert in Washington
know enough to decide how much a doctor should charge for a
kidney operation in Wisconsin?
   The more complex the world, the simpler the rules of the
game should be and the more that information-age individuals
will be able to collect enough data to fashion their own
innovative responses to life's concerns. Think tanks, with
their focus on macrosolutions to what are essentially
microproblems, are ill-suited to such a world. That's one
reason why public policy is too important to be left to the
experts.

   President Reagan said he will nominate Frank J. Gaffney Jr. to succeed Richard Perle as the Pentagon's point man on arms control policy. 

   Mr. Gaffney, 34 years old, currently is Mr. Perle's deputy, and he is expected to continue Mr. Perle's hard-line stance on U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations. 
Mr. Perle announced March 12 that he was leaving his job as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy. 
He said he plans to write a novel. 

   Mr. Gaffney was deeply involved in last October's summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and in other administration skirmishes on arms control. 
Before joining the Pentagon in 1983, he was a staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and worked on President Reagan's national security transition team. 

   President Reagan also announced that he will nominate James H. Billington, the director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, to be the new librarian of Congress. 
Mr. Billington, 55, will succeed Daniel Boorstin, who has announced his intention to retire. 

   Mr. Billington formerly was a history professor at Princeton University. 
He has written books on Russian culture and other subjects.

   First they liked Ike, then they didn't like
Ike, then they liked Ike again: that's the pattern of historians'
appraisal of Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose place in history is still
to be fixed.
   Writing in the centennial year of Eisenhower's birth, historian
Alan Brinkley says there's something to be learned about America
and the American people from Eisenhower's see-saw reputation.
   Brinkley's view is pertinent since George Bush's presidency is
sometimes compared to Eisenhower's.
   Bush, like Ike, is prudent, uneager to expand government's role.
Like Ike, Bush is accused of lacking vision. Like Ike, Bush
presides at a time of peace and prosperity and is accused of doing
nothing about problems looming just below the surface.
   Bush, like Ike, is enormously popular in the polls. At this
stage, he seems as unbeatable as was Ike when he ran for
re-election in 1956.
   When people are suspicious of government, have been disappointed
by it and expect little from it, says Brinkley, their appreciation
rises for Eisenhower and his safe but inactive tenure.
   When people look to government for bold leadership and vision,
he says, do-nothing Ike falls in repute.
   Brinkley, a 1971 graduate of Princeton who was a snip of a lad
when Eisenhower was president, is professor of history at the
graduate school of the City University of New York. He reviews the
record in the Wilson Quarterly, a magazine published by the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.
   Jimmy Carter is undergoing the same sort of reappraisal that's
been Eisenhower's fate.
   Carter's stance as an outsider and his ``I'll never lie to you''
campaign seemed just the antidote to the disillusionments of
Vietnam and Watergate. But, plagued by events beyond his control _
the Iran hostage crisis and the oil embargo _ he left office
condemned as ineffective.
   Lately, building on his peacemaker's reputation forged in the
Camp David accord, Carter has been winning fresh respect for his
selfless pursuit of a better world.
   In Eisenhower's case, he was much loved by a people he did not
much lead.
   His presidency, says Brinkley, ``mirrored the success and
complacency that characterized much of American life during the
1950s,'' the ``I Love Lucy'' era.
   Genial Ike, war hero, played golf and bridge and palled around
with rich businessmen. Despite his popularity, historians had begun
finding fault with his record even before he left office.
   ``Throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s, scholars dismissed
Eisenhower as a bland mediocrity, a model of what a 20th Century
president should not be,'' Brinkley says.
   A 1962 poll of historians ranked Eisenhower 22nd out of 33
presidents, just above Chester A. Arthur. The charge was that he
failed to govern or inspire. Historians saw him as passive,
ineffective, even ``vaguely stupid,'' Brinkley recalls.
   By the end of the 1970s, however, a new verdict was taking hold,
partially because the Eisenhower papers had become available to
scholarship.
   No longer seen as the stumblebum, Ike now was regarded as
decisive and skillful, articulate, informed and commanding.
   In a new poll, in 1982, historians ranked him ninth, above John
F. Kennedy.
   This was post-Vietnam and post-Watergate. Ike was seen as having
shrewdly known the limits of American power.
   The evaluation arose from ``the profound disillusionment with
social activism that began during the late 1960s; the association
of liberalism with Vietnam, with economic instability, with racial
conflict and with the disappointing results of social policy
initiatives,'' Brinkley says.
   What doomed Ike to condescension had been ``his refusal to
accept the idea that government had a great and compelling
mission,'' says Brinkley.
   What raised him in estimation were those same qualities, he
says, at ``a time when many Americans came to question the
desirability of a powerful president and the feasibility of a large
and active government.''
   ``Nothing in Dwight D. Eisenhower's uneventful presidency
ensures him an important place in political history. He was not a
Lincoln or Wilson or Roosevelt, who led the nation through great
crises,'' says Brinkley. ``He was not a Kennedy or Johnson or
Nixon, who, for better or worse, charted new paths and left the
nation's public life forever altered.''
   Brinkley's verdict: Ike's reputation will remain ``a hostage to
Americans' fluctuating expectations of their leaders and their
state.''

   More than 60 years ago, James Stewart
arrived at Princeton University with an accordian and an ambition
to become an engineer.
   The engineer dream, the famed actor recalled Friday, was dashed
after just a year at the Ivy League school.
   ``College algebra,'' Stewart, 81, recalled with a smile, ``was
like a death blow.''
   But Stewart, who on Saturday will receive the school's highest
alumni honor _ the Woodrow Wilson Award _ said his prowess on the
accordian helped him gain his first parts in the school's Triangle
Club theater productions.
   ``Then the parts got a little bigger,'' Stewart said at a news
conference. ``I guess you could say I started in the acting
business through my accordian.''
   Stewart later stalled plans to study architecture in graduate
school to join Princeton classmate Joshua Logan in a summer stock
company, and one of America's most fabled acting careers was
launched.
   He starred in such films as ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''
``The Philadelphia Story,'' ``Harvey,'' ``Rear Window,'' and his
personal favorite, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   Stewart, an Academy Award winner for his acting, holder of
medals for his service during World War II, and recipient of the
nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom, said being
honored by his alma mater ``is one of the most important events of
my life.''
   ``I was a terrible student,'' said Stewart, who graduated in
1932. ``I started out with the idea that I wanted to become an
engineer because I was interested in aviation. After my first year,
every teacher, every man that I had anything to deal with, said the
same thing: `You're in the wrong racket. Engineering is not for
you.'''

   First they liked Ike, then they didn't like
Ike, then they liked Ike again: that's the pattern of historians'
appraisal of Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose place in history is still
to be fixed.
   Writing in the centennial year of Eisenhower's birth, historian
Alan Brinkley says there's something to be learned about America
and the American people from Eisenhower's see-saw reputation.
   Brinkley's view is pertinent since George Bush's presidency is
sometimes compared to Eisenhower's.
   Bush, like Ike, is prudent, uneager to expand government's role.
Like Ike, Bush is accused of lacking vision. Like Ike, Bush
presides at a time of peace and prosperity and is accused of doing
nothing about problems looming just below the surface.
   Bush, like Ike, is enormously popular in the polls. At this
stage, he seems as unbeatable as Ike was when he ran for
re-election in 1956.
   When people are suspicious of government, have been disappointed
by it and expect little from it, says Brinkley, their appreciation
rises for Eisenhower and his safe but inactive tenure.
   When people look to government for bold leadership and vision,
he says, do-nothing Ike falls in repute.
   Brinkley, a 1971 graduate of Princeton who was a snip of a lad
when Eisenhower was president, is professor of history at the
graduate school of the City University of New York. He reviews the
record in the Wilson Quarterly, a magazine published by the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.
   Jimmy Carter is undergoing the same sort of reappraisal that's
been Eisenhower's fate.
   Carter's stance as an outsider and his ``I'll-never-lie-to-you''
campaign seemed just the antidote to the disillusionments of
Vietnam and Watergate. But, plagued by events beyond his control _
the Iran hostage crisis and the oil embargo _ he left office
condemned as ineffective.
   Lately, building on his peacemaker's reputation forged in the
Camp David accord, Carter has been winning fresh respect for his
selfless pursuit of a better world.
   In Eisenhower's case, he was much loved by a people he did not
much lead.
   His presidency, says Brinkley, ``mirrored the success and
complacency that characterized much of American life during the
1950s,'' the ``I Love Lucy'' era.
   Genial Ike, war hero, played golf and bridge and palled around
with rich businessmen. Despite his popularity, historians started
finding fault with his record even before he left office.
   ``Throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s, scholars dismissed
Eisenhower as a bland mediocrity, a model of what a 20th-century
president should not be,'' Brinkley says.
   A 1962 poll of historians ranked Eisenhower 22nd out of 33
presidents, just above Chester A. Arthur. The charge was that he
failed to govern or inspire. Historians saw him as passive,
ineffective, even ``vaguely stupid,'' Brinkley recalls.
   By the end of the 1970s, however, a new verdict was taking hold,
partially because the Eisenhower papers had become available to

   No longer seen as the stumblebum, Ike now was regarded as
decisive and skillful, articulate, informed and commanding.

   The evaluation arose from ``the profound disillusionment with

initiatives,'' Brinkley says.
   What doomed Ike to condescension was ``his refusal to accept the

   What raised him in estimation were those same qualities, he

   ``Nothing in Dwight D. Eisenhower's uneventful presidency

nation's public life forever altered.''
   Brinkley's verdict: Ike's reputation will remain ``a hostage to
Americans' fluctuating expectations of their leaders and their

   Humanity owes much to Woodrow Wilson -- not least to his
vision of a world ruled by popular consent in which
aggression would be prevented or punished by the collective
action of the international community. This is the perennial
dream that in our own time George Bush has rebaptized the New
World Order.
   The Wilsonian vision had a codicil: the doctrine of
self-determination. "Every people," Wilson said, "has a right
to choose the sovereignty under which they shall live." What
principle could seem more unexceptionable -- indeed, more
logical -- than this? Self-determination appears the
inevitable deduction from the whole idea of democracy and
self-government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet the doctrine presents anomalies. Indeed, the American
tradition is quite equivocal on the subject of
self-determination -- an equivocation embodied in the
contrast between our two greatest presidents. As the
historian Betty Miller Unterberger has pointed out, we
celebrate George Washington because of his success in
carrying out a struggle for self-determination -- and we
celebrate Abraham Lincoln because of his success in
suppressing such a struggle.
   Self-determination was a noble doctrine when urged by
Americans against Britain in 1776; less so when urged by the
Southern states against the national government in 1861.
Woodrow Wilson himself was born in Virginia, and eight years
old when Lee surrendered at Appomattox; but as a scholar he
rejected the claims of self-determination and portrayed the
Civil War as the development that "completes the Union."
   His secretary of state, Robert Lansing, warned Wilson in
1918 that the doctrine of self-determination when propounded
without definitions and without criteria could be "utterly
destructive of the political fabric of society and would
result in constant turmoil and change." How, Lansing asked,
to define the "people" who have a right to choose their own
sovereignty? How to establish due process by which the
"people" make this choice? After all, the Civil War had
committed the U.S. to "the principle that a national state
may by force if necessary prevent a portion of its territory
from seceding without its consent especially if it has long
exercised sovereignty over it or if its national safety or
vital interests would be endangered."
   Wilson took the point. He was well aware, as he told the
British ambassador, that "pushed to its extreme, the
principle would mean the disruption of existing governments,
to an indefinable degree." He was initially opposed, for
example, to the dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Nonetheless, with appropriate qualifications, the principle
reshaped Europe after the First World War and was reaffirmed
by Roosevelt and Churchill in the Atlantic Charter in 1941.
   Self-determination thereafter went into eclipse when the
Cold War split so much of the world between two armed
ideologies. Now the end of the Cold War has brought the era
of ideological conflict to a conclusion. But it has not, as
forecast, brought an end to history. One set of hatreds gives
way to the next. Newsweek the other day quoted Simon
Petrovic, a Yugoslav political scientist: "Minorities are
going to be an acid test for all post-communist societies.
With communism all but disappearing, tribal instincts are
coming back." The era of ideological conflict is giving way
to a new and menacing era of ethnic, racial and religious
conflict. Yugoslavia is the tragic case immediately in point.
It will not be the last case.
   In retrospect, the Soviet empire can be seen as a de facto
equivalent of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. The
dissolution of the Soviet system after the Cold War, like the
dissolution of the Hapsburg system after the First World War,
has released pent-up national and ethnic aspirations -- and
antagonisms -- deeply rooted in history and in memory. The
disintegration of the Soviet Union and now of Yugoslavia
emboldens separatist movements all across Europe on both
sides of the old Iron Curtain.
   "Spain's Nationalists Press for Independence" was a
headline the other day in the New York Times. If Armenia is
independent, then why not Catalonia? If the Lithuanians enjoy
self-determination, why can't the Basques? And why not
Slovakia? Corsica? Brittany? Wallonia? Jersey? Scotland?
Quebec? Every minority contains minorities of its own. Where
does self-determination stop?
   Roger Thurow recently described in this newspaper the
activities in Geneva of the chief lobbyist of the Sorbian
(no, not a typo for Serbian) Nationality for Autonomous
Lusatia, a movement that sounds as if it had been invented by
Evelyn Waugh. In the old days Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and
Liechtenstein were harmless tourist attractions. Do they
perhaps now represent the wave of the future?
   And of course the new passions of self-determination are
hardly confined to Europe. The proliferation of microstates
with few people and no real viability but the same votes in
the General Assembly as the U.S. and China is likely to
become the bane of the United Nations.
   And microstates sounding off in the General Assembly are
innocuous compared to the cruel violence wrought across the
Third World by the rage for self-determination among peoples
living under the same sovereignty. Self-determination turns
too quickly into self-destruction. The fate of Beirut has
offered for some time a ghastly preview of a possible future.
From South Africa to Sri Lanka, from Israel to India, from
Angola to Trinidad, ethnic conflict is tearing nations apart.
"The virus of tribalism," the Economist has well said, ". . .
risks becoming the AIDS of international politics -- lying
dormant for years, then flaring up to destroy countries."
   The time has surely come to reconsider the doctrine of
self-determination and to incorporate the limitations that
Wilson himself acknowledged and that the experience of the
U.S. confirms. Small is not necessarily beautiful. The
objective should not be to give every people the right to
choose the sovereignty under which it shall live. It should
be rather to seek ways by which people of diverse ethnic,
religious and racial backgrounds can be brought to live
together in harmony under the same sovereignty.
   This is all the more urgently the case in an era that will
be marked more than ever before by the mixing of peoples. As
the 20th century draws to a close, a number of factors -- the
end of the Cold War, the development of swifter modes of
communication and transport, the acceleration of population
growth, the breakdown of traditional social structures, the
flight from tyranny and from poverty, the dream of a better
life somewhere else -- converge to drive people as never
before in mass migrations across national frontiers.
   For such reasons President Bush seems to me to be right in
not rushing to recognize the independence of the peoples
whose aspirations are currently breaking up the Soviet Union
and Yugoslavia. One can understand these aspirations. But
claims to self-determination can be contagious, and the
result can be to rend the political fabric of society.
Self-determination is OK up to a point. Beyond that point it
leads toward incoherence and anarchy.
   Consider our neighbor to the north, long deemed the most
sensible and sedate of nations. Yet, as Michael Ignatieff
(the Canadian-born and English-resident son of a Russian-born
Canadian diplomat; thus an example of the contemporary mixing
of peoples) recently put it: "Here we have one of the five
richest nations on earth, a country so uniquely blessed with
space and opportunity that the world's poor are beating at
the door to get in, and it is tearing itself apart. . . . If
one of the top five developed nations on earth can't make a
federal, multi-ethnic state work, who else can?"
   The answer to that increasingly vital question has been,
at least until recently, the U.S. But today, even here, the
outburst of multicultural zealotry threatens a spread of
separate ethnic and racial communities, a new tribalism. If
the U.S. can't continue to provide the world an example of
how to make a federal, multi-ethnic state work, then the 21st
century will be dismal indeed. But that is another story.

<TEXT>
   The key event of America's 20th century, as esteemed sociologist Robert Nisbet presents it, was Woodrow Wilson's intervention in World War I. 
A utopian moralism long fermenting in American life suddenly hit the world stage and its consequences were devastating for America no less than for the rest of the world. 
Almost overnight the U.S. became an absolute state. 
The president found himself able to set up boards and commissions that mobilized the nation's resources, including its thoughts, for war. 
In "The Present Age: Progress and Anarchy in Modern America" (Harper &amp; Row, 145 pages, $17.95) Mr. Nisbet remembers that his music textbook, as late as 1926, contained no German songs. 
They had all been removed in the great mental mobilization of 1917-1919. 

   The paradox was that "the Wilson War State" clamped upon the dispersed American people a form of closed national community far more drastic than anything that had happened in European states, the intellectual climate of which seemed much more promising for such proto-totalitarian experiments. 
There were several reasons for this. 
One was that Americans are perhaps more completely helpless in the face of a morally improving idea than skeptical Europeans. 
Another is the alarming disposition in the U.S. for solving problems by legislation. 

   Due process and the rule of law are great American virtues, but every virtue, as La Rochefoucault noted, is the shadow of a vice, and runaway legalism became American's emergent vice. 
The problem of alcoholism was instantly solved by the brilliant expedient of prohibiting alcohol by law, and the U.S. has ever since been solving by regulation every problem that moves, from race to how the sexes should be remunerated. 

   The story Mr. Nisbet tells is the tragedy of virtue ruining vast tracts of American life. 
A quixotic passion to set the world to rights became a democratic absolutism from which the domineering bureaucracies of today have sprung. 
Seldom in this century has the U.S. been without a grand national purpose, and each of these projects has advanced the bureaucratic domination of life. 
The New Deal took up where Woodrow Wilson left off. 
The Cold War kept alive the vast establishments of World War II. Even social services turned into the War Against Poverty under Lyndon Johnson. 

   It is no wonder that Mr. Nisbet finds "the prevalence of war" one of the central themes of the American century. 
Even as metaphor, war is an irresistible trumpet call blown by politicians seeking to spend more money and exercise more power. 
It invokes what Mr. Nisbet calls the Great American Myth, which also dates from 1917: the belief that an aroused America had the military power to do to Germany in a few months what the British and French had failed to do in as many years. 
Mr. Nisbet traces disasters like Vietnam to the resulting thoughtless bravado. 

   He reinforces the warning about parasitic military establishments already sounded in Paul Kennedy's "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers." 
Created less to serve the national interest than to promote a universal moral mission, the American military now constitutes a gigantic bureaucracy notable as much for its profligacy as for its inefficiency. 

   The Star Wars project is merely the latest adventure undertaken in the service of utopian grandiosities dreamed up by what Eisenhower famously called "the militaryindustrial complex." 
Mr. Nisbet notes that "when the cruiser Stark was badly crippled in the Persian Gulf . . . it was not the complex, exquisitely sensitive radar computer system that alerted the ship's commander and crew but rather a sailor in the crow's nest -- the oldest form of seagoing intelligence, we may assume, in history." 

   It is a familiar theme that Americans are too ready to believe that high technology will solve problems that in reality require moral effort. 
It is the moral degeneration of the U.S. toward which Mr. Nisbet's argument leads. 
The serious virtue of the Founding Fathers, who constitute Mr. Nisbet's continuing point of reference, has been steadily eroded by commercialism. 
Two of his many examples will suffice: the sporting hero becoming a profit-making corporation -- Budge and Kramer turning, God help us, into McEnroe -- and the transformation by which the honor of government service has been reduced to little more than a necessary preliminary to the indiscretions that earn the book advance, the profitable lecture tour and the consultancy arrangements. 
Americans today "hang loose" to their past, their honor, their jobs, and even their families. 
It makes for a thin texture of life. 

   "The Present Age" is thus a Jeremiad that belongs on the same shelf as other recent works that have dwelt upon the dangers of decline, such as those of Allan Bloom and Paul Kennedy. 
It has the advantage of being short and crisp, and written from the resources of a well-stocked mind. 
A subplot finds the intellectual roots of what is wrong with America in the thought of Descartes, Rousseau and Bentham. 

   This reviewer is skeptical of such judgments, just as he is puzzled by a couple of intemperate pages on the great-books courses in American colleges. 
There is, indeed, a certain preciosity about teaching great books as if we owed them a duty of piety, but in the present fashion-swept terrain of education, a concern with these totems of tradition is at least some anchorage in a past that, as Mr. Nesbit rightly complains, is slowly liquefying into a kind of sugary nostalgia. 

   The real horror of the kind of national decline Mr. Nisbet describes is its resemblance to Greek tragedy, in which every attempt to stop the drift merely seems to accelerate the decline. 
The true cause of the current American pessimism is that everybody knows that Ronald Reagan rightly diagnosed the problem in the late '70s. 
They know just as surely that the Reagan project has failed. 

   There is no lesson more portentous for the next century than that in modern Western societies, bureaucratized vested interests are virtually impossible to shift short of actual physical violence. 
President Reagan came to power pledged to shrink the state, and the bureaucracy has in fact grown by something like 13%. 
There are as many Americans locked in a culture of dependency on government as there were in 1980, and the defense budget has risen. 
Mr. Reagan's "debts, deficits and duplicities," as Mr. Nisbet gloomily concludes his argument, "appear to lead {the} nation and {the} world." 

   Fortunately, there's an awful lot of ruin in a nation, and Mr. Nisbet himself recognizes that there remain many good things about the U.S. Yet if America does in fact manage to avoid catastrophe in the coming century, it will be only because Americans have taken books like this one very seriously indeed.

   Shortly after Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1976,
he had a momentous three-way telephone conversation with
tele-evangelist Pat Robertson and his colleague Lou Sheldon.
Messrs. Robertson and Sheldon offered to prepare a list of
evangelicals whom President Carter might appoint to high
government office. The president-elect thought this was a
jimdandy idea, so long as he could have the list within two
weeks.
   A few days later, the pair flew to Plains, Ga., to deliver
the list to Mr. Carter. Inexplicably, the new president broke
down in tears. Mr. Sheldon mistakenly believed that Mr.
Carter was weeping because he was so touched by the gesture.
But the more canny Mr. Robertson immediately realized that
the president was crying because "the appointment process is
out of his hands." The cabal of sinister forces in the thrall
of Lucifer that secretly rules America would never seriously
consider any personnel suggestions advanced by the Pat
Robertsons of the world. It's nice to know that somebody in
the Carter administration knew what he was doing, even if it
had to be the Prince of Evil.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson is known to millions of Americans who have
velour tapestries of poker-playing doggies and Confederate
flags hanging from their walls as the chairman of the
Christian Broadcasting Network and The Family Channel, and as
the host of the talk show "The 700 Club," where his permanent
village idiot's grin gives him the appearance of a
trailer-park David Letterman.
   But Mr. Robertson is more than a smarmy tele-evangelist;
he is also an author, a philosopher and a statesman. In 1988,
he ran a serious campaign to win the Republican nomination
for the presidency, performing creditably in the sovereignly
bizarre state of Iowa before quietly fading away. During that
campaign, he briefly suppressed the all-round nuttiness that
is his stock in trade, hoping to fuse his huge following of
couch potato airheads with mainstream Republicans to form a
powerful grass-roots coalition. But mainstream Republicans
told him to get lost. Having been rebuffed by the electorate,
Mr. Robertson is now free to return to the spacecadet
political theories that got him off the ground in the first
place. Those theories are contained in his new book, "The New
World Order" (Word Publishing, 319 pages, $17.99).
   The way Mr. Robertson has things sized up, the current
disarray in the Soviet Union is part of a secret Russkie plot
to lull the West into a false sense of security. The August
KGB coup was deliberately "programmed to fail," so that the
U.S. would stop spending money on defense. Eventually, the
role of defending the world will fall to the hated United
Nations, whose armies will suppress Christianity, wipe out
free enterprise, force the entire planet to live under a
single government -- the New World Order -- and deliver
humanity into the hands of Satan.
   To understand how the World According to Pat reached such
a horrible impasse you must go back to the French Freemasons
of the 18th century, then work your way up through the
Bavarian Order of Illuminati and Buonarrotti's Sublime
Perfect Masters in the 19th century, which will take you
right up to Lenin and Woodrow Wilson, who were both working
for the American Money Trust, which, of course, financed the
Russian Revolution and bought Wilson's way into the White
House so that he could set up the Federal Reserve Board and
the IRS.
   "Until we understand this commonality of interest between
left-wing Bolsheviks and right-wing monopolistic
capitalists," writes Mr. Robertson, "we cannot fully
comprehend the last seventy years of world history nor the
ongoing movement toward world government." Well, I admit, it
did have me a bit confused.
   The New World Order is a predictable compendium of the
lunatic fringe's greatest hits. Included in its pages are the
usual mad ramblings about European money powers (we know who
they are) who hired John Wilkes Booth to knock off Abe
Lincoln, the significance of the Masonic symbols on the $1
bill, the secret clout of the Council on Foreign Relations,
the recall of General Douglas MacArthur, and the great
granddaddy of both ultra-right-wing and ultra-left-wing
conspiracy theories: the Trilateral Commission.
   In his energetically crackpot style, Mr. Robertson weaves
a wild tale of international and extraterrestrial
conspiracies, involving everyone from deposed Nicaraguan
dictator Anastasio Somoza to Alger Hiss to Woodrow Wilson --
an unwitting tool of Satan, whose role in the establishment
of the Federal Reserve eventually resulted in the nation's
abdication to the most Machiavellian creature of all time:
Paul Volcker. Indeed, the only credible idea in Mr.
Robertson's book is his oblique suggestion that demonic
forces may have been instrumental in the birth of the Fed and
the IRS.
   Still, as paranoid pinheads with a deep distrust of
democracy go, he's a bit of a disappointment. As he rambled
on and on about the Panama Canal and -- you guessed it -- the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, I found myself longing for some
of my other favorite Bonzo Dog Band materials. Where, for
example, is the stuff about JFK's secret meeting with Martin
Borman in the Bermuda Triangle? Where is the stuff about
extraterrestrials visiting the Mayans and telling them to
give the Spear of Longinus to Elvis? And what self-respecting
harbinger of doom would write an apocalyptic jeremiad without
once mentioning the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail?
   Amateur.

<HEAD>University President Believed Among Americans Dead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former president of Brandeis Univesity and
his wife are suspected to be among the Americans killed in last
week's fire at a luxury hotel, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said
Sunday.
   The spokeswoman said the bodies of Marver Bernstein and his wife
were believed to be in the Cairo morgue but she could not confirm
the deaths until a medical report was received. So far, she said,
they are listed as unaccounted for.
   Dr. Kamal el-Saadani of Cairo's central morgue said Friday that
a man with a similar name was among the dead and that the body of
an unidentified woman was thought to be that of his wife.
   If confirmed, the deaths would bring to four the number of
Americans killed in the hotel fire Thursday at the Heliopolis
Sheraton, in which 17 people died.
   According to The Washington Post, Bernstein, 71, was dean of the
Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at
Princeton University before serving as president of Brandeis in
Waltham, Mass., from 1972 to 1983. He then joined the faculty of
the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, where he taught both
politics and philosophy and coordinated the school's American
courses program.
   After his retirement from Georgetown last year, he remained as a
lecturer. Bernstein, born in Mankato, Minn., and Sheva Rosenthal, a
native of St. Paul, Minn., married in 1943, the paper said.
   Also Sunday, police said all Cairo hotels will be checked for
adequate firefighting equipment.
   Maj. Gen. Fahr el-Din Khaled, head of the tourist police, said a
police committee would check all hotels whether or not they have
canvas tents similar to the one at the Sheraton where the fire
started.
   ``This committee will prepare a comprehensive report which will
be presented to the tourism minister to take suitable procedures so
that such accidents do not happen in Egypt again,'' Khaled said,
according to the official Middle East News Agency.
   Sheraton officials have insisted that a fire alarm was sounded
when the fire spread from its garden tent restaurant to the hotel
building itself early Thursday.
   They said hotel workers tried to put out the blaze with
extinguishers, but strong winds caused it to spread so quickly it
became uncontrollable.
   Survivors said there was no fire alarm or sprinkler system.
   Egyptian officials have said the canvas tents popular at most
luxury hotels in Egypt are illegal because they are fire hazards.
   But spokesmen for four major hotels in Cairo contacted by The
Associated Press said their tents had adequate safety precautions
and there was no plan to dismantle them.
   It was not immediately clear if officials would ban the tents,
which usually house restaurants or nightclubs.
   Tourism is one of Egypt's main sources of foreign currency. In
1989, 2.4 million tourists visited Egypt, bringing $2.3 billion
into the country, according to official figures.

   Jimmy Stewart reminisced about
Hollywood's past and retired Adm. William Crowe addressed the
military's future as fellow alumni honored the two famed Princeton
University men Saturday.
   The Alumni Association gave Stewart its Woodrow Wilson Award for
undergraduate alumni distinguished in public service. The James
Madison Medal, the graduate student equivalent, was bestowed on
Crowe, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Stewart, 81, an Indiana, Pa., native, came to the Ivy League
campus more than 60 years ago with an accordian and hopes for an
engineering degree. He charmed an audience of 850 with
self-deprecating humor and strong opinions about the movie industry
today.
   He remembered his poor mathematics ability that dashed his
freshman hopes of being an engineer, saying he switched to
architecture on the ``advice of several people, including my math
teacher, to stay away from mathematics.''
   Summer stock theater after his senior year led to Broadway,
which led to an MGM contract. He has appeared in 80 movies.
   The two-time Oscar winner made it clear he prefers the Hollywood
of his early days in the business over today's Hollywood.
   ``I feel very strongly, looking back, that the big studio system
is the only real way to make pictures,'' said Stewart.
   ``You didn't sit at home waiting for a script you liked. You
were there every day. ... Frankly, I think if things were like that
today we'd be getting much better movies.''
   The studio moguls of the day, Stewart said, ``loved motion
pictures. They didn't need censors. They knew what was right for
the public. They hated sequels. You know, they make one today and
you get six more.''
   He told an anecdote about a man who approached him on a movie
set and told him:
   ```Yeah, yeah, I saw you in a picture. ... You were in this
room. There was a girl there. ... I don't know who the girl was.
You sort of went toward the door, and as the guy went to the girl,
I forget what he said, but he said something to you. You turned and
looked at him, and I'll never forget that look.'''
   Stewart told his audience: ``I knew exactly the picture. I knew
exactly who was in it. I knew exactly that turn and I knew his
reaction to the turn was the reaction I hoped I would get.''
   Crowe, who recently retired from the military to teach
geopolitics at the University of Oklahoma, received a doctorate
from Princeton in 1965.
   He cautioned against the United States too quickly reducing its
military in response to the democracy movement and new governments
in Eastern Europe and decreased U.S.-Soviet hostilities.
   He predicted turmoil until ``the power is sorted out.''
   ``We do not know as yet what the final replacement regimes will
look like,'' he said. ``I suggest it will be a tough and trying
time, if not a dangerous one.''

<TEXT>
   President John F. Kennedy, Harvard class
of 1940, couldn't resist some good-natured teasing when Yale
awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1962.
   ``As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledged America to be
the daughter of Europe, so I am pleased to come to Yale, the
daughter of Harvard,'' Kennedy told graduates assembled in the
courtyard of Yale's Old Campus on that sunny June day.
   ``It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds _ a
Harvard education and a Yale degree,'' Kennedy said.
   This year's presidential campaign has elevated what is perhaps
the oldest, most intense and most snobbish rivalry in America to a
new height.
   For the spoils of this contest will go either to a Yale man or a
Harvard man _ only the second time in 200 years that graduates of
the two schools have vied for the presidency of the United States.
   And the only other time it happened, in 1912, the Harvard man,
Theodore Roosevelt, and the Yale man, William Howard Taft, both
lost to a Princeton man, Woodrow Wilson.
   While Kennedy was a master at exploiting his Harvard education
for political advantage, Republican George Bush, Yale class of
1948, has tried to turn Democrat Michael S. Dukakis' Harvard
connections into a campaign liability.
   Bush, scion of a wealthy Greenwich, Conn., family, accuses the
Massachusetts governor, the son of Greek immigrants, of having a
``Harvard boutique'' mentality tainted by ``liberalism and
elitism.''
   Campaigning Saturday in Modesto, Calif., Bush said, ``I don't
want somebody from Harvard telling me what I can do and what I
can't do.''
   Asked about that statement at a news conference Sunday, Bush
said he did not want to take on the institution itself, asking
``How can I, a nice guy from Yale, feel that way about Harvard? Now
come on.
   ``I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in
(recent) Democratic administrations that come out of the same
liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said.
``There's an elite inside the elite there.''
   Dukakis, in turn, has tried to stay out of the Harvard-Yale
debate, saying his 1960 Harvard law degree and teaching stint at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government don't make him a Harvard man
at all.
   ``I'm a Swarthmore guy,'' Dukakis says, referring to the liberal
arts college in Pennsylvania where he received his undergraduate
degree.
   But Bush's Harvard line held little sting given his own Ivy
League connections. And it probably was lost on most Americans, who
view both Yale and Harvard as elite Eastern universities for the
wealthy.
   Dukakis campaign aides couldn't hold their tongues when outgoing
Education Secretary William Bennett, himself a Harvard Law School
graduate, asserted on national television in September that the
Harvard crowd ``with which Mike Dukakis runs ... think they're
smarter'' than most Americans.
   ``Bill Bennett spent seven or eight years getting an education
in Massachussetts and these comments are a clear indication that it
didn't do him a bit of good,'' shot back Mark Gearan, press
secretary at Dukakis' Boston headquarters.
   Harvard and Yale have eyed each other with haughty disdain for
nearly 300 years, since Yale was founded in 1701 by a group of
clergy worried about religious backsliding at the more liberal
Harvard, the oldest college in America. Harvard was founded in
1636, just 16 years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.
   ``We have been natural rivals almost from the beginning,''
George Pierson, the Larned professor emeritus of history at Yale,
said recently. ``We were the only two with the exception of William
and Mary that you could go to. After that, we both grew in the
favor of the Lord.''
   The Harvard-Yale annual crew race is the oldest intercollegiate
sports rivalry in America, dating from 1852. The schools refer to
their annual football contest as ``The Game,'' as if all others
hardly matter.
   Other Harvard-Yale presidential campaigns have been averted only
by quirks of history. The 1824 election would have pitted Harvard
graduate John Quincy Adams against Yale graduate John Calhoun, but
Calhoun dropped out and threw his support to Adams, who defeated
Andrew Jackson, who didn't have a college degree.
   The 1876 contest between Rutherford B. Hayes, a graduate of
Harvard Law School, against Samuel Tilden would have been a
Harvard-Yale matchup, except Tilden dropped out of Yale after one
year and graduated from New York University.
   Although this is only the second head-to-head match, Harvard and
Yale both boast presidents among their graduates. While Yale holds
the edge in their football series, 56-40, and Harvard holds the
edge in crew races, 72-51, Harvard holds a substantial lead in the
presidential sweepstakes: six Harvard graduates have held the
office _ John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Hayes, Theodore Roosevelt,
Franklin Roosevelt and Kennedy _ compared to just two from Yale _
Taft and Gerald Ford, a 1941 graduate of Yale Law School.
   Raymond Wolfinger, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, says most Americans don't give a hoot about
the Harvard-Yale rivalry.
   ``In terms of the mass public, the difference between Harvard
and Yale is nonsense,'' said Wolfinger, who earned his doctorate at
Yale.

   Scientific researchers in American universities
should be required to disclose financial relationships with industry
that might create conflicts of interest, a congressional
subcommittee was told Tuesday.
   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within
universities over a relatively short period of time,'' said Sheldon
Krimsky, associate professor of urban and environmental policy at
Tufts University. ``I have heard it said within the scientific
community that everyone gains from this marriage of academia and
commerce. Nothing can be further from the truth.
   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public
confidence in science.''
   Krimsky said that at least 45 per cent of the biomedical faculty
at Harvard, as an example, have formal affiliations with 36
biotechnology companies.
   He called for disclosure of financial interests related to
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants.
   Dr. George D. Lundberg, vice president for scientific information
of the American Medical Association, cautioned, however, that
barring researchers from working in areas where they had a financial
interest ``would be devastating, and we would lose many qualified
people and we would lose much information that would have come from
those people if they had worked.''
   ``A lot of things motivate human beings, and money's one of the
big ones,'' Lundberg said.
   He said that if he had been a journal editor in 1905 looking for
somebody to write an article on automobiles, he would have asked
Henry Ford.
   ``Would Henry Ford have been in conflict of interest? Totally,''
he said. ``Would I care? No. I'd love that. He'd know the most about
it.''
   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University who is
suing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on grounds that he
was fired for speaking out against conflicts of interest, said
university researchers ``are free to make undisclosed arrangements
with private corporations in which they often have equally
undisclosed personal roles.''
   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in
research and many have done so,'' he said. He argued that such
collaboration between universities and industries should be
accompanied by ``proper disclosure and procedural safeguards.''
   Noble criticized MIT's Industrial Liaison Program, in which he
said firms pay a membership fee to the institution and gain access
to research publications and other information.
   He told the subcommittee that ``nearly all the member
corporations of the ILP were multinationals with no necessary
allegiance to the United States, that fully half of them were
foreign, that 57 of them were major Japanese competitors, and that
the ILP had for nearly a decade been operating an overseas sales
office in downtown Tokyo.''
   Paul E. Gray, president of MIT, told the panel that the
institution ``would not operate this program were its only benefit a
stream of revenue.''
   ``The educational and research functions of this science-based
university require broadly-based understanding of industrial
practice and industrial needs,''Gray said. ``The ILP is an important
vehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principal
benefit to the institute.''
   Patricia K. Woolf of the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton
University, agreed that such arrangements can be beneficial but said
the subject needs further study.
   Dr. David Blumenthal, senior vice president of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, said that ``academic research
institutions must insist on disclosure of relationships with
industry that may create economic conflicts of interest.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the human resources
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, said, ``I
am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or
manipulated for personal gain.''
   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the
panel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to the research
community that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.''
   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struck
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way
of overall progress.''

Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. -- a company that recently filed a 
lawsuit against the county and is embroiled in controversy surrounding its work 
at the John Wayne Airport terminal -- is one step away from building a $7.9 
million sports complex at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved Cal State Fullerton's choice of Taylor 
Woodrow because the contracting company was the project's lowest bidder, met 
qualifications required by the California State University system and is 
involved with successful construction projects at Cal State campuses in Long 
Beach and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of Taylor Woodrow is expected in September when the Cal State 
University board of trustees vote on the selection. The complex is a joint city 
and university project. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William Winter expressed apprehension over the university's choice 
of Taylor Woodrow, saying the city is "relying completely" on Cal State 
Fullerton's report. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has "done some extensive checking on Taylor Woodrow and 
feel they can handle the job," Winter said. "We're just pleased that we were 
able to get a bid that meets our cost parameters." 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. has been under 
attack by county officials for alleged cost delays in its construction of the 
John Wayne Airport terminal. In May, the company sued the county alleging 
breach of contract after it was stripped of the $25-million road and parking 
garage contract at the airport. The company is seeking $7.2 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Orange County airport terminal, Taylor Woodrow California is 
involved in a $30-million project on the Anaheim Convention Center, which city 
officials have said is three months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd., a subsidiary of Taylor 
Woodrow Construction California Ltd., is involved in a dispute with the city of 
Laguna Niguel, which is threating to halt some housing construction on 99 acres 
of park land the company received. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, city officials still are confident in Cal State 
Fullerton's choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had numerous conversations with the university about its choice of 
Taylor Woodrow," said City Councilman Richard Ackerman, noting that the 
"airport issue" was a the primary topic. "But I feel comfortable with the 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman said a penalty clause is included in the proposed contract, and would 
fine Taylor Woodrow if it is not able to meet the completion date. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Bond, associate vice president for facility planning for Cal State 
Fullerton, said the company would be assessed a daily fine of $3,000 every day 
it goes beyond the completion date. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on whether the board of trustees approves Taylor Woodrow, 
construction is scheduled to begin Sept. 24. The project is expected to be 
completed by the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
According to state guidelines regarding the Cal State University bidding 
process, if a contractor meets the university's qualifications and guidelines, 
the school must pick the lowest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The university was hoping to build the complex for $6 million. But of the three 
bids submitted in June to the university, Taylor Woodrow was the lowest at $7.9 
million. The entire project is expected to cost $10.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Johnson, a consultant hired by Taylor Woodrow to act as the company 
spokesperson, defended Taylor Woodrow's record, saying the company is involved 
in a wide variety of jobs, and it would be unfair to compare the magnitude of 
the John Wayne Airport project to a project such as Cal State Fullerton's 
sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Rinella, Cal State Fullerton's vice president for administration, said the 
city plans to front the entire $10.2 million for the project, of which $4.7 
million will be paid back by the university through annual revenues based on 
its share of the Marriott Hotel.

<HEAD>Survey Says Kennedy Most Overrated American; Reagan No. 2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John F. Kennedy is the most overrated public
figure in American history, while his predecessor, Dwight D.
Eisenhower is among the most underrated, according to a sampling of
historians and journalists.
   Kennedy topped the voting among 75 prominent historians and
journalists surveyed by American Heritage magazine, with President
Reagan taking second place among the most overrated Americans.
   Neither was a consensus choice, however. Kennedy was picked by
eight of the experts; Reagan by four.
   The results appear in the July-August issue of American Heritage.
   Four public figures, all presidents, tied for first place in the
most underrated category, but only got two votes each: Eisenhower,
John Quincy Adams, Ulysses S. Grant and James K. Polk.
   Of Kennedy, historian and novelist Thomas Fleming wrote: ``I
write this with a lump in my throat. But the record shows that his
public relations approach to the presidency was an almost total
disaster for the nation, from the Bay of Pigs to the Berlin Wall to
the missile crisis to the halfhearted intervention in Vietnam.''
   Fleming was among those who chose Polk, the seldom-remembered
11th president, as the most underrated public figure. He called
Polk a ``hardworking and decisive'' president ``who brought a
program to the office and realized almost all of it. ... We could
use a large dose of his example today.''
   Eisenhower was the choice of historians Walter Lord and Arthur
Ekirch. When Eisenhower stepped down in 1961, Lord wrote, he had
``left the country strong and prosperous; the civil rights battle
was off to an important start at Little Rock; and Joe McCarthy had
been defused.''
   Presidents dominated both ends of the survey, with Woodrow
Wilson and Harry S. Truman tying for third place among the most
overrated figures. However, numerous non-presidents, including
several women, received votes.
   Among the women named as the most underrated American were
Eleanor Roosevelt, Abigail Adams, the radical theorist Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, transcendentalist Margaret Fuller and journalist
Sarah Josepha Buell Hale. Betsy Ross picked up a most-overrated
vote.
   Finally, these were the choices of University of Chicago
professor Martin E. Marty, who probably deserves a vote for most
original respondent of the survey:
   Most overrated American: Uncle Sam.
   Most underrated: John Q. Public.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis is trying hard to beat the rap that his experience as a
governor has not equipped him to handle national defense and
foreign policy.
   He has talked tough on military spending and driven an M-1 tank;
met with foreign leaders from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to French President Francois Mitterrand, and he has
extolled the virtues of governors who became president.
   Or three of them, anyway.
   ``Some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest
international leaders, were governors: Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow
Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt,'' Dukakis said in the first
presidential debate.
   He did not mention the last two presidents, both of them former
governers whose foreign policy performances have brought mixed
reviews.
   Ronald Reagan, a two-term California governor, is regularly
lambasted by critics who say he is unfamiliar with the nitty gritty
of national security. He is faulted for such acts as the 1983
invasion of Grenada and the 1986 bombing of Libya and for moving
slowly on arms control. His record as president will be tainted by
the Iran-Contra affair, as well.
   Jimmy Carter, who was governor of Georgia, is blamed by
conservatives for reacting poorly to revolutions in Iran and
Nicaragua and for allowing U.S. influence abroad to deteriorate.
   If elected, Dukakis would be the third man in a row to move from
the state house to the White House without having held a senior
federal job.
   Only one other former governor, Wilson of New Jersey, has become
president in this century without previously holding top elected or
appointed federal office.
   Franklin Roosevelt, lauded by Dukakis, was assistant secretary
of the Navy during World War I before he served as governor of New
York. Theodore Roosevelt held identical posts at the turn of the
century before becoming vice president and then president.
   Dukakis doesn't have those entries on his resume, but like
others before him, he is trying to ``create a lot of ersatz
credentials'' in foreign policy, said Stephen Hess, who was an aide
to former President Nixon.
   ``They go on trade missions. They join the Council on Foreign
Relations or the Trilateral Commission, which is what Carter did,''
said Hess, now a scholar at the liberal Brookings Institution in
Washington.
   Or they ride tanks and meet with foreign leaders.
   Governors who are elected president ``rely on a brain trust. But
so does everybody else, too, as the field becomes more
specialized,'' said Hess. ``Even Richard Nixon, who was truly
engaged in foreign policy and made it his life interest, brought in
specialists,'' notably Henry Kissinger, who served as his national
security adviser.
   Graham T. Allison Jr., a Dukakis foreign policy adviser, says
the Massachusetts governor's ``style as a leader and governor is
quite different from either Reagan or Carter.''
   Dukakis' ideas ``come out of interaction with other folks. There
is a combination of progressive values and pragmatism that is
something special. It is not classic liberalism,'' said Allison.
   Carter's view of the world was shaped by his career as a
submarine officer in the Navy and his devotion to his Baptist faith.
   He appointed a strong-minded national security adviser, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, a Columbia University professor of Soviet affairs, born
in Poland and deeply suspicious of the Kremlin.
   Carter appointed a very different personality as his secretary
of state, Cyrus Vance, a Wall Street lawyer and veteran of senior
government appointments who was deeply committed to diplomacy and
negotiations.
   ``There were two world-views spinning around'' at the top level
of government, said Hess, and the result was a sometimes confused
and vacillating approach to foreign affairs that ultimately brought
Vance's resignation.
   Allison said ``Carter was very interested in detail. He had
difficulty keeping his mind focused on the big picture, and was
unable to resist an overly expansive agenda.''
   ``Reagan is very effective at projecting a few central themes
but does not involve himself directly in the issues, neither in the
broad shape of the issues or in the details. But he has kept in
mind a few simple things and knows what a manageable agenda is,''
said Allison, who is dean of the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, where Dukakis once taught and
where he turns for much of his foreign policy advice.
   Conflicting views of the world at the top of the administration
``were not Reagan's problem,'' Hess said. ``He had a distinct point
of view that the people who were working for him had no trouble
following.''
   Reagan survived several overseas debacles, including the bombing
of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983, but his hands-off
management style contributed to the worst policy crisis of his
administration, the exchange of arms for hostages with Iran.
   Clearly ``Reagan has had trouble with national security
advisers,'' running through six in seven years, said Hess.
   Dukakis has not said publicly who he might appoint national
security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected. But among
those often mentioned for those two important posts are Allison and
two colleagues from the Kennedy School, Joseph Nye and Albert
Carnesdale, along with Madeleine Albright, a Czechoslovakian-born
Georgetown University professor who served in the Carter White
House.

   While politicians normally don't want to be
linked with women other than their wives, there's one gal that
candidates have been fawning over for more than 100 years.
   She's 151 feet tall and stands demurely in New York Harbor.
   Candidates and their image makers say there's no better company
to be seen in _ especially on coast-to-coast television _ than that
of the Statue of Liberty.
   So coveted is she as political company that the campaigns of
Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, and
Republican vice presidential contender Sen. Dan Quayle clashed over
which of them would hold the lady's hand this Labor Day.
   Quayle prevailed, but only because he asked first, according to
the National Park Service. As the statue's custodian, the Park
Service takes great pains to assure the statue does not show
favorites.
   Still, she has been always been a willing companion since her
dedication by President Grover Cleveland in 1886. Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon have all paid calls on the
statue during re-election bids.
   ``The Statue of Liberty is something special,'' says Greg
Stevens of Ailes Communications, media consultant for George Bush.
   For tugging at voters' emotions, the grandiose statue and her
dramatic surroundings are a better backdrop than any Hollywood set.
   The statue took its prime place in the World War I war bond
drives of 1917, replacing the female Columbia as the
personification of America, says Park Service archivist Barry
Marino.
   No less an image maker than Alfred Hitchcock dropped a villian
from the statue's torch in ``Saboteur'' about 27 years before
putting Cary Grant and Grace Kelly on Mount Rushmore in ``North by
Northwest.''
   ``There's more emotion packed in the Statue of Liberty than
almost anything else in America,'' Stevens says.
   President Reagan chose Liberty State Park in Jersey City, N.J.,
to kickoff the 1980 campaign that put him in the White House. The
Hudson River-front park offers a dramatic view of the statue
against the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan.
   Wilson, running against New York Republican Charles Hughes in
1916, led an elaborate parade to relight the statue's torch after
it was damaged by sabatoge. Roosevelt, campaigning against Alf
Landon in 1936, gave a dramatic radio address by the statue during
its 50th anniversary celebration.
   This year, along with Quayle and Dukakis, former presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson has used the park as a political staging
ground.
   Both Dukakis and Quayle wanted to appear Monday at the
two-island Statue of Liberty-complex: Liberty Island, where the
statue stands, and Ellis Island, where millions of immigrants
entered the United States in the late 1800's and early 1900's.
   Since Quayle asked first, Dukakis had to settle for a tour of
Ellis Island on Saturday. He escorted his mother, Euterpe, a Greek
immigrant who arrived in this country via the island.
   ``It's first come, first served,'' explained Edie Shean-Hammond,
a Parks Service spokeswoman.
   She said rangers follow strict guidelines in issuing permits for
speeches and demonstrations. Access for daily visitors always comes
first, followed by equal access for anyone seeking to use the
statue as a soapbox.
   ``We have to play this really close to the book,'' Ms.
Shean-Hammond said.

   Your June 30 editorial "The Democrats' European Disease" is largely on the mark. 
Europe's rigid labor laws appear to have turned labor into a fixed cost. 
While these laws may protect the lucky workers with jobs, they tend to militate against young workers looking for work. 
The relatively high European unemployment rates, especially among young people, support this hypothesis. 

   Your graph on employment growth, however, strikes me as misleading. 
It shows growth in total employment, without proper adjustment for overall population growth. 
Between 1970 and 1986, for example, the West German population remained stationary at 60.7 million while that of the U.S. grew from 205 million to 241 million. 
Consequently, over the same period the labor force (people working or wishing to work) in West Germany grew from 26.2 million to only 27 million (that is, by only 3%), while the U.S. labor force grew from 82.8 million to 115.5 million (that is, by more than 39%). 

   It is misleading to compare American with European growth rates in employment (and in gross national product, for that matter) without adjusting for these demographic trends, as is so often done on this side of the Atlantic. 
The American economy may have been a bit more productive in creating jobs than have its European counterparts. 
The main difference in economic growth, however, reflects the fact that our population is still growing quite rapidly while Europe's is not at all. 
Perhaps we are better lovers, but experts question even that hypothesis.

<P>
Poor George Bush. By temperament and training, he may be the best-qualified man 
in America to administer the foreign policy and the alliances we inherited from 
the 1940s, but history has given him an infinitely more difficult assignment. 
The world is being remade and, like Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. 
Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, Bush is doomed to work under the spotlight of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Will he throw away a historic opportunity for lasting peace -- like Wilson at 
Versailles? Will he concede too much -- like Roosevelt at Yalta? Or will he 
achieve the elusive goal that U.S. diplomacy has sought through a century of 
revolution and war, to create the foundations for a peaceful and prosperous 
world? 
</P>
<P>
These questions haunt the meeting between Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
Disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union blocked a peace 
treaty to end World War II and, since the '40s, U.S.-Soviet negotiations have 
been maddeningly difficult, frustratingly slow. Bush's predecessors won praise 
for even limited agreements with a recalcitrant Soviet Union, but historians 
will inevitably ask whether Bush, in the face of unprecedented opportunities, 
rose to the occasion with requisite wisdom and enough of "the vision thing." 
</P>
<P>
He will need plenty of both. The face of Europe changes day by day, and no one 
knows what it will look like in 10 years' time. Independence movements within 
the Soviet Union, the push for German reunification and the host of territorial 
claims and counterclaims that have kept Eastern Europe in turmoil for centuries 
threaten to plunge the world into a new generation of conflict. The Hungarians 
think about their "lost territories" to the east and south of their current 
boundaries; the Turks and Bulgarians nurse their ancient mutual grudge; the 
Albanians and Yugoslavs quarrel over Kossovo even while Yugoslavia's 
nationalities revive ancestral feuds; Romania wants the return of territories 
taken by Josef Stalin in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Security and territorial questions are bad enough; economic issues are even 
more grave. Despite all the encouraging talk from the West, there is no 
guarantee that market economies will send fleets of Volvos humming through 
dingy East European streets. Eastern Europe was poor before Stalin; it may not 
grow rich after Gorbachev. Historically, Eastern Europe has been the 
Continent's Latin America -- a region where economic potential was stunted by 
political and cultural obstacles. Worse, no country anywhere in the world has 
yet made a successful transition from communist to capitalist economy. 
Yugoslavia, where reform started earliest, is in deep trouble and the other 
reforming economies -- the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland -- have problems of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of economic trouble and political chaos should give us all 
pause. Eastern Europe may want to join the West, but the region could end up 
like the Middle East -- a hotbed of chauvinism and a breeding ground for war. 
It's been that way since the Goths fought the Romans; a Nazi occupation 
followed by a generation of communist repression may not have laid the 
groundwork for peaceful cooperation among these long-suffering peoples. 
</P>
<P>
This prospect is one problem confronting Bush, but it is far from the only one 
he faces. The economic problems of the United States, almost forgotten in the 
spate of news from Europe, are still with us: trade and budget deficits in 
excess of $100 billion a year; the value of the dollar still depends on the 
attitudes of West German and Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, the United States was a creditor nation; its economic supremacy could 
not be doubted. A war-ravaged world looked to America for its daily bread. Our 
economy, our technology and our political system enjoyed a global prestige we 
can no longer command. Bush has a weaker hand than his predecessors; we must 
all hope his skill as a player can make up for the deficiencies in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate difficulty facing Bush -- an unprecedented problem for 
recent times -- is how to keep the United States in the game. The great 
movements in Europe today -- the consolidation of the Common Market, the 
reconciliation of the Germanys and the liberation of the East -- are all out of 
our control. In the chaos of his collapsing empire, Gorbachev is closer than 
any of his predecessors to the dearest goal of postwar Soviet diplomacy: 
cutting a deal with Western Europe that excludes the United States. As many 
Europeans -- especially the Germans -- fear the Soviets less, they feel less 
need for the Atlantic connection. 
</P>
<P>
The history of this century teaches that the New World cannot afford to be 
isolated; Europe and America need one another. As the old Cold War rationale 
for the Atlantic Alliance fades, Bush must do more than rethink relations with 
the Soviets, he must find a new framework for U.S. relations with Europe as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
To make this work, he must find strategic partners in Europe who are willing to 
work with the United States toward a common vision of the future. This probably 
means Paris. Britain is too poor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has 
allowed herself to become too isolated to be of much use; the West Germans are 
preoccupied with their own concerns. Of all major European powers, France is 
most likely to see things our way. The French distrust Soviet intentions as 
much as we do, but they are as cautious as we are -- perhaps more so -- about 
the prospects of a strong, united Germany at the center of Europe. Like us, the 
French would like to see a rapidly growing world economy and a reduction in 
German and Japanese trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
Both Paris and Washington seem to understand the importance of cooperation. 
While relations between French and U.S. leaders have sometimes been chilly, 
Presidents Francois Mitterrand and Bush have cemented a warm personal 
relationship based on mutual respect. Reportedly, Bush believes Mitterrand is 
the most farsighted and realistic of West European leaders and like most 
Europeans -- Thatcher excepted -- Mitterrand greatly prefers Bush to his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Bush must regain diplomatic initiative with bold and imaginative strokes. It 
isn't easy to get out in front of Gorbachev, one of history's great 
scene-stealers, but Bush has one possibility. He can, in consultation with U.S. 
allies, call for a general peace conference to deal with the questions left 
over from World War II and new questions that rise from the ruins of Stalin's 
empire. A peace conference would have an even broader mandate than the Helsinki 
II gathering Gorbachev proposed Thursday, and would touch on some subjects -- 
such as the infamous Hitler-Stalin agreements -- that Gorbachev might prefer to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Peace conferences, or "conferences of nations," are the way the modern West has 
tied up the loose ends of one war and tried to avoid the next. While 
conventional negotiators focus on one specific issue, a peace conference works 
on all outstanding problems, always keeping one eye the new world order being 
created. 
</P>
<P>
A peace conference could find the appropriate framework for German 
reunification and take up the broader issue of Eastern Europe. In the current 
climate it will be possible to extend and strengthen the Helsinki Accords, 
perhaps including the right of appeal to international bodies in the case of 
violations of human rights. The French-backed concept of a European Development 
Bank with international -- including U.S. and Japanese -- participation could 
take firmer shape; the various East-West negotiations for arms reductions may 
make faster progress if part of a much broader process. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has the opportunity to succeed where Wilson and Roosevelt failed, but the 
window for peace may never open this wide again in our lifetimes. The hatreds 
of World War II have subsided; the bitterness of the Cold War is fading; every 
major power has more to hope for than fear from a general settlement in Europe. 
Gorbachev has indicated that the Soviets are ready to come to the table; bold 
leadership now from Bush will do more than assure his place in history. In the 
long term it can place the peace of Europe -- and the world -- on a firm 
foundation. In the short term it will put the United States back where it 
belongs: at the center of international affairs and in the forefront of the 
struggle for peace.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Has Powerful Weapon To Negotiate Trade
Accords</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-known deal between the White House and
Congress should make it easier for President-elect Bush to reach
agreements with the rest of the world on tough trade issues such as
the current dispute over hormones in U.S. beef.
   Beginning Sunday, the 12 countries of the European Economic
Community are banning all imports of meat treated with hormones _
including U.S. beef and veal worth about $100 million a year. The
Reagan administration promised to retaliate by raising duties on
European food shipped here.
   Counterretaliations and counter-counterretaliations are
threatened, in what some see as a potential trade war.
   Over the long run such conflicts can be limited by the United
States using the ``fast track'' for making trade agreements. A
series of agreements is being drafted by 96 governments in the
current ``Uruguay round'' of trade talks.
   Despite its name, the fast track is less important for its speed
than for the power its gives the president. Reagan signed the latest
version into law last August as part of a major trade bill. On
Wednesday he issued an executive order on regulations to implement
the new law.
   It associates key members of Congress closely with trade talks,
though not as actual negotiators. After an agreement is reached,
Congress is pledged to vote it up or down in 90 days _ no exceptions
or conditions, no internal bargaining over details.
   That differs from the usual relations between the White House and
Capitol Hill. Often the administration and Congress bargain for
months or even years over what goes into an important bill before it
becomes law _ or fails.
   The fast track allows the administration to make promises that
are bound to be unpopular in Congress, such as ending protection for
a small industry against foreign competition. Under the fast track
system the negotiators can gamble that Congress will accept the
entire agreement, even if many members dislike parts of it.
   Governments of other countries long have complained that they
cannot get firm commitments from a U.S. negotiator. They can make
firm promises themselves because the French or Japanese prime
ministers, for example, can threaten to dissolve parliament and
force members to fight a new election unless his promises are
supported. A U.S. president can't do that.
   Raymond Vernon, who negotiated for presidents from Franklin
Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter, tells a story about Lord Keynes, the
famous economist who came to Washington to get more aid for Britain
in World War II. Keynes was annoyed to hear one official after
another explain how Roosevelt favored many measures but Congress
would not approve them.
   Keynes dropped his usual politeness when one American, more
pompous than the others, began by saying:
   ``My government _ ''
   ``You know,'' Kenyes interrupted, ``you people don't really have
a government at all, in the usual sense of the word.''
   Many officials, Americans and non-Americans, fail to grasp the
difference between the American system and the parliamentary system.
Non-Americans often complain that the United States has gone back on
a pledge when a U.S. negotiator promises his best effort to get
something done and then Congress _ not operating on the fast track _
refuses to do it.
   Some blamed President Woodrow Wilson for World War II because he
negotiated for a League of Nations after World War I and Congress
refused to join it. Wilson failed to bring key senators close to the
negotiations.
   Vernon identified the inventor of the fast track as Richard L.
Rivers, a Washington lawyer who worked for the Senate Finance
Committee in 1973. President Nixon was trying to negotiate what was
first called the ``Nixon round'' of trade agreements. The White
House asked Congress for a law that would give him almost unlimited
power to negotiate, but allow either house to disapprove the result.
   Rivers said in an interview that he will always remember former
Sen. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., a key member of the Finance Committee,
fiery reaction to that proposal: ``That's not the way we make our
laws in this country.''
   The Supreme Court since has ruled that such ``legislative
vetoes'' are unconstitutional.
   Rivers wrote a memorandum that devised the fast track for
Talmadge and it became law as part of the president's authority to
negotiate. It was used under Nixon and President Ford to complete
what became known as the ``Tokyo round'' after Nixon resigned.
   Later versions of the fast track have been used under Reagan to
negotiate free trade agreements with Israel and Canada.
   In a recent book, ``Beyond Globalism,'' Vernon has proposed
widening it.
   ``There is a strong temptation to look for a mechanism in which
the main lines of trade policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy and
establishment policy will have been jointly explored between the
branches in an effort to identify the key assumptions, establish the
principal goals and iron out the gross inconsistencies,'' he wrote.
   But he added that it is difficult to envision an effective
dialogue between the president and Congress on so wide a range of
issues.
   Vernon, 75 years old, has retired as a professor of international
relations at Harvard University. His book was written with Debora L.
Spar, who was studying for a doctorate there.

<TEXT>
   Fire gutted a mansion designed to
resemble the White House, causing about $4 million in damage to the
estate that was once a West Coast retreat for President Woodrow
Wilson, authorities said.
   The 75-year-old house, which overlooks a 4.6-acre estate, was
owned for more than 10 years by Dovie Beams de Villagran, the
self-described mistress of former Phillipine President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   The fire Thursday night destroyed the roof and top floor, said
Fire Department spokeswoman Diane Johnson.
   Construction work was being done at the time and no one was
living at the estate, she said. The cause of the blaze was under
investigation, Johnson said.
   The mansion, designed by architect Sumner Hunt and built in 1913
for Houston lumberman Henry House, was visited frequently by Wilson
following his election in 1912.
   The house was sold by Beams two years ago. Officials would not
identify the new owner.

<P>
Like the rest of us, our Presidents are diverse. They are the children of the 
wealthy and educated, the children of the poor. They were born on historic 
plantations on the river banks of Virginia, in modest wood-frame homes on the 
Midwestern plain, on ranches in Texas cattle country. They are the sons of 
ministers, of farmers, of land barons, of laborers. 
</P>
<P>
And some of the homes where they were born are open to the public. To visit 
those homes is to be reminded of several things: Of our right to travel to 
those homes. Of our right to aspire to their position. Of their origins, which 
often were humble. Of our right to elect the leaders of our choice. 
</P>
<P>
When our nation was born on the Fourth of July, so were our opportunities. 
Let's celebrate with a quiz on some lesser-known facts about our Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Which two Presidents died on the same day -- July 4, 1826? 
</P>
<P>
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Which state produced the President who held office for only one day? 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky. David Rice Atchison, born in Frogtown, Aug. 11, 1807, who, as 
president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, effectively became leader of our 
nation for one day -- March 4, 1849, when President-elect Zachary Taylor, a 
staunchly religious man, refused to take office on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Which President's birthplace is claimed by two states? 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Jackson, born March 15, 1767, in Waxhaw settlement on the farm of his 
aunt near the North Carolina/South Carolina border, but before the border was 
drawn. North Carolina commemorates its favorite son with a highway marker about 
20 miles south of Charlotte. South Carolina celebrates its home-grown president 
with Andrew Jackson State Park on U.S. 521, north of Lancaster. The park 
features a picnic area, nature trail, camping and fishing facilities and a 
one-room schoolhouse and museum that contain artifacts of the period and the 
area. Call (803) 285-3344. 
</P>
<P>
What is placed in a time capsule beneath the site of Gerald Ford's Omaha 
birthplace? 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, during the Bicentennial, officials planted a time capsule beneath the 
President Gerald R. Ford Birthsite &amp; Gardens in Omaha. It contained, among 
other things, a six-pack of Falstaff beer, sealed but empty. In addition, it 
contained a football, a plastic telephone showing how the parts work, two 
manikins depicting 1976-era dress and income tax information from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Who was the only President to be married in the White House? 
</P>
<P>
Grover Cleveland, who in June 1886 married 21-year-old Frances Folsom, 
Cleveland's ward since her father died in 1875. Her father had been one of 
Cleveland's law partners. 
</P>
<P>
What profession did the fathers of Presidents Grover Cleveland and Woodrow 
Wilson share? 
</P>
<P>
Both were Presbyterian ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Which birthplace is on land still inhabited by a late President's widow? 
</P>
<P>
The L.B.J. birth site, at the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park near 
Johnson City, Tex., is on the ranch where Lady Bird Johnson sometimes resides. 
</P>
<P>
Which state is birthplace of eight Presidents and the final resting place of 
seven? 
</P>
<P>
Eight Presidents were born in Virginia: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, 
James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor 
and Woodrow Wilson. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Tyler, William 
Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy all are buried in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Which state was the birthplace of the second-greatest number of Presidents? 
</P>
<P>
Seven U.S. Presidents -- Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. 
Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren 
G. Harding -- were born in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Who is the only President born in California? 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Which President was born on the plantation where "Taps" was composed? 
</P>
<P>
William Henry Harrison (son of Declaration of Independence signer Benjamin 
Harrison, who also lived in the house, and grandfather of 23rd President 
Benjamin Harrison) was born on Berkeley plantation in Virginia. That is where 
"Taps" was composed in 1862 while Union Forces were encamped there during the 
Civil War, and where the first bourbon whiskey in America was distilled in 
1621. 
</P>
<P>
On what date was the Declaration of Independence formally adopted by the Second 
Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia? 
</P>
<P>
If you don't know the answer to this, ask any grade-school child. (Penalty for 
an incorrect answer is that you must go to work on Tuesday.) 
</P>
<P>
As a reward for successfully completing this quiz, here are a few Presidential 
birthplaces to visit at your leisure. They also are a reminder of how we began 
and who we have become. 
</P>

County. The original house burned in 1779. A memorial house was reconstructed 
on the site. A Colonial farm, kitchen and workshop also help show a typical 
plantation. The land is tilled by oxen and the crops are the same as those 
planted during Washington's childhood. Washington's great-grandfather, 
grandfather and father are all buried there, about 38 miles east of 
Fredericksburg, Va., near the Potomac River. Call (804) 224-1732.

in Hodgenville, Ky., in rolling hills in the central part of the state. The log 
cabin, which has been reconstructed on the original site, is now housed in a 
stately granite memorial. At the time the family lived there, Lincoln's father 
was a farmer. The family owned 348 acres, but probably only farmed a few acres 
at a time. The family of four, including Lincoln's parents and one sister, 
lived in the cabin until Lincoln was 2 1/2 years old. The visitor center 
contains a family Bible with Lincoln's name written in it. Three miles south of

leather chest, both made by Grant's father, who was a tanner. In 1890 the house 
was taken on a tour of the United States (either on a river boat traveling by 
waterways or by railroad flat car) so that the public could see it. The house 
later was returned to its original foundation, about 27 miles southeast of 
Cincinnati in the Clermont County village of Point Pleasant off Ohio 52. The 
birthplace is open April 1 through Oct. 31, Wednesday through Saturday, 9:30

is original. Open Wednesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call (212) 
260-1616. 
</P>
<P>
Woodrow Wilson (28th President): Born at about midnight, leaving the date in 
doubt, Dec. 28 or 29, 1856, in a Presbyterian manse in Staunton, Va. Built in 
1846 in Greek Revival style, the house contains furnishings and mementos of the 
Wilson family. The reception center exhibits items from Wilson's life as 
educator, statesman and President. A guided tour of the estate includes the 
12-room house with original furnishings, exhibits, the formal Victorian garden 
and Wilson's Pierce-Arrow limousine. Wilson's birthplace is open daily, except

p.m.). Don't miss the recorded tour narrated by Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. Call 
(617) 566-7937. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon B. Johnson (36th President): Born Aug. 27, 1908, in a small farmhouse on 
the banks of the Pedernales River in Gillespie County, Tex., about 15 miles 
west of Johnson City, in the Hill Country of south-central Texas. A 
reconstruction of the original farmhouse sits on the original site, rebuilt by 
Johnson in 1964. The Johnsons planned it to serve as a guest house for visitors 
to the LBJ ranch, but rarely used it as such. Because Lady Bird Johnson still, 
at times, lives on the ranch, the birth site is accessible only by a bus tour 
of the LBJ ranch at Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. The park, which 
also houses the Texas White House and the Johnson Family Cemetery, is open 
daily (except Christmas) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Call (512) 868-7128 or (512) 
644-7128. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon (37th President): Born Jan. 9, 1913, in a small frame house in 
Yorba Linda, Calif. It is under construction as the future site of a library, 
museum and archives. Furnishings and mementos from the original home have been 
preserved for use in the museum. Target date for opening the home is July, 
1990. Although it is not possible to get on the grounds, it is possible to 
catch a glimpse of the farm on the corner of Eureka and Yorba Linda boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald R. Ford (38th President): Born July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Neb. The house 
Ford was born in was destroyed by fire in 1971. In 1977 the site was bought and 
developed into a memorial. It houses a fountain and the Betty Ford Rose Garden. 
The original home was built in 1893 for $10,000, a high price for that period. 
When Ford was just a few weeks old, his mother separated from his father, 
Leslie King Sr., who was a well-to-do businessman. They divorced and his mother 
eventually moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., where she married Gerald R. Ford, who 
adopted Ford and changed his name from Leslie King Jr. The memorial, at 3200 
Woolworth Ave., is open daily, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan (40th President): Born Feb. 6, 1911, in an apartment above a 
bakery at 111 S. Main St. in Tampico, Ill. The building, which was later turned

undergoing restoration. The museum is open May through November, 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m., or by appointment. Call (815) 438-2130 or (815) 438-2815.

It's something akin to love that makes Monroe (Bookie) Clark spend most of his 
time and energy volunteering at his alma mater, Hoover High School. While he 
could be quietly enjoying his retirement from the insurance business, the 
64-year-old Talmadge resident is instead "getting pumped up," calling out the 
scores at the school's basketball games, or helping a foreign student learn to 
read, or ferrying a teen-ager to and from a summer job. Clark, who graduated 
from Hoover in 1943, insists he's just doing what anyone could do if they had 
the time. He says it's astonishing what a difference volunteering a couple of 
hours a week can make. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Clark, and 
Bob Grieser photographed him.

I was born and raised here in San Diego. When I was 9 years old, my folks built 
a home out in Talmadge, and I've lived there ever since. In fact, I don't think 
there's anybody who's lived in their house continuously like I have since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
I had polio as a kid. I walked better then than I do now. I went to Woodrow 
Wilson Junior High, and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. They usually 
wouldn't let handicapped kids go to public school. In those days, they didn't 
have any facilities. Someone on crutches, well, you never saw anybody on 
crutches. 
</P>
<P>
If you were handicapped in those days, in the '30s, they had a school called 
the Sunshine School you went to. 
</P>
<P>
My first exposure to regular school was at Sacred Heart Grammar School. I went 
there in sixth grade. Then the next year, the principal at Woodrow Wilson said, 
"Hey, we'll take Monroe in." My folks had to sign a waiver in case I got hurt. 
I was the only crippled kid in the school. 
</P>
<P>
And then I went to Hoover. That really expanded my getting around and doing 
things. In those days, in 1940, Hoover was one of only two highs schools. 
Hoover was the focal point of everything out there in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The war was on. Everybody had this great feeling for their country, their 
school, everything. When I went to Hoover, there were only two black kids, and 
one Japanese boy, and I can't remember any Mexicans. We had a lot of loyalty; 
there was no race prejudice there. 
</P>
<P>
I've only really been volunteering probably less than a year, but through the 
Kiwanis Club I've been involved in Hoover since 1953. The Kiwanis sponsor the 
Key Club at school, and we sold things at the football games. Now, I announce 
the basketball games, and I love it! It's fun being around the kids. 
</P>
<P>
I started thinking, "What can an individual do?" A teacher at Hoover said to 
me, 'Well, Bookie, you ought to come over here and get involved in our computer 
lab.' When I went in there, there was this little girl sitting there, reading 
with the help of a teacher's aide. I said, 'How could a clown like me help a 
young girl like that to read?' 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said, 'Just give me two hours.' I like a challenge. I said, 'You're 
on.' Now, a couple hours a week isn't enough for me. I go in, and by the end of 
the day, I am so pumped up. It's exciting that a fourth-grade Vietnamese girl 
wants to read to me. 
</P>
<P>
I see a great need for the community to get involved and do things. Why don't 
people who are sitting around volunteer a couple of hours a week at a school? 
Anybody could help. If a person would get involved, it's extremely interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The thing I'm interested in is getting other Hoover people to do little things. 
It's amazing what little things you can do to make an impression on these kids. 
</P>
<P>
I have a ton of friends who are getting ready to retire and are bored with 
life. I'm so doggone busy. . . . I consider myself the luckiest guy in the 
whole world. I can't walk nearly as good as I walked five years ago, and I feel 
like I'm doing 10 times as much as I did five years ago.

<TEXT>
   The landmark Sheraton Palace Hotel, a home
away from home for six presidents and armies of celebrities since
1875, has closed for the first time since the great earthquake of
1906 for a $60 million, 18-month renovation.
   ``It's very strange. It's very lonely,'' Donald Timbie, the
hotel's general manager and vice president, said Monday as the hotel
shut down.
   The quake, which destroyed much of the city, triggered a fire
which gutted the original, seven-story hotel. But 12-foot-thick
brick walls saved the shell and it was rebuilt to its current nine
stories and reopened Dec. 16, 1909, with other alterations in 1915,
1919 and 1925.
   Tenor Enrico Caruso was a guest as the temblor struck. He was
tossed from his bed and vowed, ``I will never set foot in San
Francisco again.''
   ``Actually, the earthquake only destroyed 8 percent of the
structure,'' said Jim Kilroy, the hotel's director of marketing.
``The fire did the rest.''
   The hotel has been host to Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, William
Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry
Truman. Warren G. Harding died there, in room 8064 on Aug. 2, 1923.
   Other notables who stayed at the Palace include Mark Twain, Oscar
Wilde, Charles Lindberg, Amelia Earhart, Charlie Chaplin, Nikita
Khrushchev and Winston Churchill.
   President Woodrow Wilson gave his famous League of Nations speech
there, and the Garden Court held the official banquet honoring the
opening session of the United Nations.
   King David Kalakaua of Hawaii, the last of the island's monarchs,
died at the Palace on Jan. 20, 1891.
   The hotel's exterior will not be altered. Neither will the Garden
Court, a 9,350-square-foot restaurant originally built as a carriage
entrance. It was declared a city landmark in 1969 and the only work
there will involve a clean-up and a change in color scheme.
   The last luncheon was held in the court Monday. The San Francisco
Opera Guild event drew about 12 people who sat at one table, dwarfed
by the huge room that features an arching dome of iridescent glass.
   The Market Street hotel, which has 525 guest rooms and 60 suites,
will add a swimming pool and health spa, along with about 5,000
square feet of meeting space.
   Market Street, which begins near San Francisco Bay and runs
through the heart of the city's business district, has undergone a
recent revival. The repaving and renovation of six downtown blocks
was completed late last year, and the opening last October of a
lavish new Nordstrom department store a few blocks from the hotel
has attracted visitors to the area.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following is the transcript of an
address delivered by President Bush on Saturday at Wenceslas
Square:
   Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, my Czech and Slovak
friends.
   It is a tremendous honor to me to be the first sitting American
president to visit this proud and beautiful country, and to be able
to join you on the first anniversary of the extraordinary Velvet
Revolution. What a powerfully moving sight it is.
   There are no leaves on the trees, but it is Prague spring.
   There are no flowers in bloom, and yet it is Prague spring. The
calendar says November 17, and yet it is Prague spring.
   Your declaration of independence claims the forces of darkness
have served the victory of light; the longed-for age of humanity is
dawning. Today, the freedom-loving people of the world can bear
witness that this age of humanity has now finally and truly dawned
on this splendid nation.
   Seven decades ago, an unprecedented partnership began between
two presidents, the philosopher Tomas Masaryk and the idealistic
scholar, Woodrow Wilson. It was a partnership as well among Czechs
and Slovaks to join together in federation. And yes, it was a long,
hard road, from their work on your declaration of independence to
this magnificent celebration today.
   I am proud to walk these last steps with you as one shared
journey ends and another begins.
   Our countries share a history. We share a vision. And we share a
friendship, a friendship Masaryk described to Czech-American
soldiers 70 years ago. He said, ``Do not forget that the same
ideals, the same principles ever unite us. Do not forget us, as we
shall never forget you.'' And that is why I'm here today - we have
not forgotten. And the world will never forget what happened here,
in this square where the history of freedom was written. The days
of anguish, the days of hope. So many times you came here bearing
candles against the dark night, answering the call of Comenius to
follow the way of light. These brave flames came to symbolize your
fiercely burning national pride.
   A year ago the world saw you face down totalitarianism. We saw
the peaceful crowd swell day by day in numbers and in resolve. And
we saw the few candles grow into a blaze. And we saw the square
become a beacon of hope for an entire nation, as it gave birth to
your new era of freedom.
   This victory owes its heart to two great heroes: Alexander
Dubcek - 22 years ago he led this nation in its first sweet taste
of liberty. His are the will and compassion that are the living
Czechoslovakia. And then President Havel, a man of wisdom, a man of
tremendous moral courage.
   In the dark years on one side sat the state, on the other side
Havel; one side tyranny, on the other this man of vision and truth.
   Among the first was Havel, and now there are millions. Today a
Europe whole and free is within our reach. We've seen a new world
of freedom born amidst shouts of joy, born full of hope, barreling
with confidence toward a new century, a new world born of a
revolution that linked this square with others - Gdansk, Budapest,
Berlin - a revolution that joined together people fueled by courage
and by humanity's essential quest for freedom.
   And for four decades, our two nations waited across the divide
between East and West, two peoples united in spirit and vision, and
yet separated by conflict. Today the United States and
Czechoslovakia stand together, united once more in our devotion to
the democratic ideal. And now with the division of Europe ending
and democracy ascending in the East, the challenge is to move
forward.
   In Czechoslovakia, from revolution to renaissance, across this
continent toward a new Europe, in which each nation and every
culture can flourish and breathe free. On both sides of the
Atlantic, toward a commonwealth of freedom based on our shared
principles and our hopes for the whole world, a commonwealth
inspired by the words of your great Comenius, written three
centuries ago, ``Let us have but one end in view, the welfare of
humanity.''
   A thousand miles to the south, this new commonwealth of freedom
now faces a terrible test. Czechoslovakia was one of the first
nations to condemn the outrage in the Persian Gulf, one of the
first to measure the magnitude of the wrong committed in the name
of territorial ambition.
   It is no coincidence that appeasement's lonely victim half a
century ago should be among the first to understand that there is
right and there is wrong, there is good and there is evil, and
there are sacrifices worth making.
   There is no question about what binds our nations and so many
others in common cause. There is no question that ours is a just
cause and that good will - that good will prevail, that darkness is
the - in the desert sky cannot stand against the way of light.
   I salute your courageous President when he joins us in saying
that Saddam Hussein's aggression must not be rewarded.
   Earlier today, I told your Parliament, ``We know this is a
difficult time for you, but also a time of extraordinary
optimism.''
   As you undertake political and economic reform, know one thing.
   America will not fail you in this decisive moment. America will
stand with you. We will continue along the road mapped out by our
Presidents more than 70 years ago, a road whose goal was described
by Woodrow Wilson, ``to bring peace and safety to all nations and
make the world itself at last free.'' For the past 70 years, your
Declaration of Independence has been preserved and cherished in our
Library of Congress. I say it is time for Masaryk's words to come
home. And as humanity and liberty return to Czechoslovakia, so too
will this treasured document.
   On behalf of the people of the United States, I am proud to be
able to tell the people of Czechoslovakia, 1989 was the year that
freedom came home to Czechoslovakia. 1990 will be the year your
Declaration of Independence came home to the golden city of Prague.
May it be, for future generations, a reminder of the ties that bind
our nations, and the principles that bind all humanity.
   In 1776, when our declaration of independence was first read in
public, a bell tolled to proclaim the defiant thrill of that
moment.
   That bell - we call it at home the Liberty Bell - has for 200
years symbolized out nation's deepest dedication to freedom,
dedication like your own. Inscribed on this bell are the words,
``Proclaim liberty throughout all the land.'' We want to help you
proclaim your new liberty throughout all this proud and beautiful
land, and so today we give to you our last replica of the Liberty
Bell.
   You know, one of our patriotic songs proclaims ``Sweet land of
liberty - from every mountainside, let freedom ring.'' And so when
bells ring in Wenceslas Square or in Bratislava or anywhere in this
glorious country, think of this bell and know that all bells are
tolling for your precious liberty, now and forever.
   And so now I am proud to ring this bell three times - once for
your courage, once for your freedom, and once for your children.
   May God bless Czechoslovakia. Thank you very much.

<HEAD>Once-Visible President Sinks From Sight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When organizers at Arizona State University
invited Ronald Reagan to give a speech last month, fewer than
one-fourth of the 10,000 tickets were sold in advance and the
former president agreed to waive his $50,000 fee.
   Reagan, who commanded vast audiences until he left office in
January ago, is now out of the limelight, retired into the select
club of former presidents that includes Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon
and Jimmy Carter.
   Occasionally, the former president pops back into the news. Both
President Bush and Vice President Quayle visited him this week in
Southern California. And his name came up more negatively in
repeated references during the Iran-Contra trial of former White
House aide Oliver North.
   Would one have expected a less reclusive retirement given
Reagan's popularity during his two-term tenure?
   Probably not, agree president watchers. They differ, however, on
whether it's the nature of the man or the nature of the system
which is responsible.
   ``It's not unusual and not at all atypical historically for a
former president to slip from sight,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, an independent
think tank.
   The advent of a new president is accompanied by a flurry of
media attention and public curiosity, Hess said, and the former
White House occupant generally just drifts away from power, Hess
said.
   Reagan, 78, works in his offices atop a Los Angeles skyscraper,
say his aides. He writes speeches on such favorite topics as the
need for a line-item veto, a balanced budget amendment and an end
to the two-term limit for presidents. He has joined the board of
the conservative magazine National Review and also is planning to
write his memoirs.
   Reagan has been virtually mum on the presidency of his
successor, and he is rarely mentioned in Washington.
   One way for former presidents to step back into the limelight is
to take a shot at their predecessor. Thus, Jimmy Carter made the
news in 1981 when he criticized Reagan's budget proposal for
placing too much emphasis on defense spending and not enough on
domestic programs.
   ``But most ex-presidents are obliging and they stay out of the
hair of the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' said
Benjamin Ginsberg, a professor of government at Cornell University.
   Bush also has been careful to avoid criticism of his
predecessor. Last month, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
admonished aides to refrain from unfavorable comparisons of Reagan
and Bush.
   Some former presidents have made a comeback several years later,
returning to vogue once a historical perspective of their
presidency has been established. Such was the case with Harry
Truman, who left office in 1953 an unpopular leader but was seen in
a far more favorable light in the 1960s and until he died in 1972.
   Presidents who cannot bear the obscurity of retirement are rare.
Theodore Roosevelt didn't want to be an ex-president so he ran
against fellow Republican William Howard Taft in 1912. His run
split the Republican vote, and gave Democrat Woodrow Wilson the
White House.
   ``Reagan is not about to upstage Bush,'' said Tom Korologos, a
lobbyist and Reagan friend who once served the Nixon and Ford
administrations as a legislative aide. ``Reagan did more for Bush
than any other president has done for his VP, and now he knows it's
time to get out of the picture,'' he said.
   Ginsberg and several other scholars and consultants believe Bush
aides are particularly anxious that Reagan maintain a low profile
for the time being. ``Bush lived in Reagan's shadow for eight
years. Now he needs to establish himself as an independent and
distance himself in some ways,'' Ginsberg said.
   Bush himself doesn't mention his predecessor very often as he
seeks to move subtly away from some of the domestic and foreign
policies known as the Reagan legacy.
   For example, in reaching a compromise agreement with Congress on
aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, Bush effectively killed future
military aid to the rebels _ a cause dear to Reagan's heart.
   ``It's a mark of Reagan's respect for Bush that he has bitten
his lip and avoided statements even on the things he felt so
passionately about like the Contras,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, who
served as Carter's domestic policy adviser and is now a political
consultant.

<TEXT>
ROSS PEROT is not a typical independent, or third-party, presidential
candidate.
He springs from no party, cannot be said to have created his own other than
informally, did not hold a convention and has no defined regional base,
other than possibly in Texas - all characteristics of most of those who have
previously sought to upset the establishment applecart.
There is always a small multitude of such candidacies on the ballot. Mr
Perot is on the ballot in every state, as is Mr Andre Marrou of the
Libertarian party, a fixture in almost every state since 1976. Others have
qualified in less than the full complement.
The most successful this century was that of Theodore Roosevelt, the former
Republican president, in 1912. His Progressive, or Bull Moose, party won 27
per cent of the popular vote, behind Woodrow Wilson's just under 42 per cent
but ahead of the official Republican candidate, William Taft, with 23 per
cent. He carried six states and won 88 electoral college votes, compared
with Mr Wilson's 435 and Mr Taft's eight.
In 1924 Robert Lafollette, a former Democrat also under the Progressive
banner, pulled in over 16 per cent, but carried only his native Wisconsin.
In 1968, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, also a former Democrat, headed
the American Independent party, got 13.5 per cent of the vote and carried
five southern states with 46 electoral college votes.
In 1948 Strom Thurmond, campaigning as a States Rights Democrat, but later a
Republican, won only 2.4 per cent of the popular vote but won four southern
states and 39 electors. Henry Wallace, FDR's vice president from 1941-45 and
the Progressive candidate that year, got only 12,000 fewer votes, but won no
state.
In 1980 John Anderson, the former Republican congressman and official
Independent, scored 6.6 per cent but won no state.
No third party or independent has taken the presidency, but both Theodore
Roosevelt and George Wallace won enough to determine who did, since both had
been identified with one of the two main parties.
Though the electoral college margins were wider, Wilson's 41.84 per cent and
Richard Nixon's 43.42 per cent in 1968 are the lowest popular vote scores
for a successful candidate this century. John Anderson hurt Jimmy Carter in
1980, but not enough to bridge the gap with Ronald Reagan.
Most independent candidacies wither as election day approaches. Mr Anderson,
for example, once enjoyed 20 per cent-plus ratings in midsummer opinion
polls.
But history again is no useful guide in assessing Mr Perot because he
started to run, then quit, and only got back in with a month to go.

days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   In 1958, the Roman Catholic patriarch of Venice, Angelo Giuseppe
Roncalli, was elected Pope, taking the name John XXIII.
   On this date:
   In 1636, Harvard College was founded in Massachusetts.

France, was dedicated in New York Harbor by President Grover
Cleveland in the presence of its sculptor, Frederic Auguste
Bartholdi.

<HEAD>Urban Poverty Seen Worsening and Escape Growing Less Likely</HEAD>

   Poverty in America's cities has grown more
persistent and concentrated over the last two decades and its
victims have less chance of escape, according to a report by the
National League of Cities.
   The study describes a changing face of poverty since 1970, with
the nation's poor more likely now to live in metropolitan areas and
concentrate in low-income neighborhoods.
   It said the proportion of children living in poverty has
increased and the likelihood of people climbing above the poverty
level has declined.
   ``Poverty in cities is changing in quality and intensity,'' the
report said. ``It is more persistent among particular households,
more concentrated within particular neighborhoods, and more isolated
from traditional avenues of escape.''
   The league released its report, ``Poverty in Cities,'' as nearly
3,000 municipal leaders gathered in Washington for the
organization's annual winter meeting, which runs through Tuesday.
   ``Both the figures and the trends are alarming,'' Alan Beals,
executive director of the National League of Cities, said in
releasing the report. ``Such conditions are devastating for those
caught up in it, especially children.''
   The report, an analysis and compilation of previous research,
said poverty in America declined through much of the 1970s, to a
rate of under 12 percent at the end of the decade. But a resurgence
brought the rate to more than 15 percent by 1985, and the average
rate for the years 1980 through 1987 was over 14 percent, the league
said.
   The portion of the nation's poor living in metropolitan areas
grew from 62 percent in 1979 to 70 percent in 1985 _ an increase of
7.6 million people, with the majority living in central cities, it
said.
   The report said the persistence of poverty _ that is, the length
of time a person remains poor _ has grown. It cited previous studies
of the proportion of urban poor in a given year who escaped poverty
the following year and said in the late 1960s, that figure was 32
out of 100.
   Called the ``escape probability,'' the figure rose to 37 out of
100 in the mid-1970s, meaning that poverty became less persistent,
but began declining and was 23 out of 100 by the early 1980s.
   ``There has been a substantial decrease in the chances that a
poor person will escape poverty within the following year,'' it said.
   An increase was also recorded in the proportion of poor residents
of big cities who live in neighborhoods that are classified as
extremely poor _ where at least 40 percent of residents live below
the poverty line. Among the 50 largest cities, the
concentration-of-poverty rate increased from 16 percent in 1970 to
24 percent in 1980 _ meaning nearly one-quarter of the large-city
poor lived in extremely poor neighborhoods.
   The report said poor neighborhoods of large central cities have
become increasingly isolated from the rest of the metropolitan
areas, with more clear differences in socioeconomic and physical
conditions.
   As more ghetto dwellers live in more isolated deprivation, their
opportunities for jobs, training and other means of climbing out of
poverty are reduced, it said.
   The study said blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites
to live in extremely poor neighborhoods, and poverty among blacks
was more persistent than for other groups. More than 21 percent of
blacks living in big cities were persistently poor throughout the 10
years between 1974 and 1983, it said, compared to a rate of less
than 3 percent for non-blacks.
   The poverty rate among children, it said, grew from 16 percent in
1979 to over 20 percent in 1985, which it called ``a startling
increase.''
   The report was written by Mark Alan Hughes, assistant professor
at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.

   That's the trouble with catchy phrases _
they're catchy.
   So when George Bush said yes, or at least maybe, to new taxes,
everybody in America already knew that he had said no 1,000 times
and said it in a catchy way: ``Read my lips _ no new taxes.''
   Bush is not the first president to break a campaign promise, but
he was so downright unequivocal that his about-face will go down as
part of the history of the Bush presidency.
   He put himself among the giants of promise-breakers:
   _Woodrow Wilson, who ran for re-election in 1916 on the slogan,
``He kept us out of war'' and five months later asked Congress for
a declaration of war.
   _Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, running against Herbert Hoover in
1932, accused Hoover of running up ``a deficit so great that it
makes us catch our breath.'' FDR, of course, became a deficit king
in office.
   _FDR, again, who in the 1940 campaign said, pretty
unequivocally: ``I have said this before but I'll say it again and
again and again _ your boys are not going to be sent into any
foreign wars.'' A year later, American boys were being sent into
foreign wars.
   _John F. Kennedy, who said in campaigning that it would take a
mere ``stroke of the presidential pen'' to end racial
discrimination in federally assisted housing. Once in office, he
took 18 months to issue a timid executive order covering very
little of the country's housing.
   _Lyndon B. Johnson who, even as his administration was making
plans to escalate in Vietnam, told voters: ``We don't want our
American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys.'' And, ``We don't
want to get tied down to a land war in Asia.'' Shortly thereafter,
he sent the first of 500,000 American boys into an Asian land war.
   _Ronald Reagan. He promised he would never deal with terrorists.
Then came the Iran-Contra affair in which he sought to swap arms
for hostages.
   What most presidents say when they feel compelled to splatter a
campaign promise is what Bush said: circumstances changed.
   Few blamed FDR for asking for a declaration of war after Pearl
Harbor. Few held his deficits against him when they saw the bread
lines shortening. And so when Bush says the deficit is getting
bigger than he'd ever imagined, big enough to threaten prosperity,
he is betting that people will go along.
   They probably will, if the rest of the bargain is kept: if he
keeps the economy perking.
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, says
whether the public forgives politicians for broken promises depends
not so much on the breaking as on the consequences.
   ``It may well be that he'll escape punishment and other
Republicans will feel the pain,'' says Buchanan. ``By time the 1992
election rolls around, there may be no consequences for Mr. Bush.''
   On this subject, a professor has written a book. He is Jeff
Fishel, professor of government at American University, and his
book is ``Presidents &amp; Promises.'' He tries to quantify broken
promises.
   He studied the campaign promises of five recent presidents _
Kennedy, Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Reagan _ and
compared them to proposals actually advanced when the candidates
became president.
   He puts the presidents' proposals in seven categories, the first
two of which are ``fully comparable'' (to campaign promises) and
``partially comparable.''
   If one adds the percentages, it turns out that Kennedy tried to
make good on more of his promises than any of the five; Reagan
scored lowest.
   But all batted over .500.
   Sixty-seven percent of Kennedy's proposals were made in
fulfillment of his campaign promises. For Johnson, it is 63
percent; Nixon 60 percent; Carter 65 percent; Reagan 53 percent.
   Fishel tracked 133 promises by Kennedy; 63 by Johnson; 153 by
Nixon; 186 by Carter; and 108 by Reagan.
   He calls his methods ``crude, very broad indicators ... that do
not and cannot fully address the complexities of candidate pledge
or presidential fulfillment'' _ but conclusive enough to find the
results commendable.
   He concludes it is ``remarkable that, once elected, every
president, from Kennedy through Reagan, has demonstrated
considerable good faith, seeking through legislation or executive
order to follow through on a majority of his campaign pledges.''
   Evidently he harbors low expectations. For that matter, so does
the public. In a Gallup Poll published at the end of May, 74
percent of the participants said Bush would not be able to keep his
no-new-taxes pledge. They read his lips, but maybe they'd read
history, too.
