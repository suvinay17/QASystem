   Archaeological exploration in Iraq has picked
up since the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, yielding rich finds
from the era 2,000 years ago when the powerful Assyrian empire
dominated the Middle East.
   The upsurge comes as President Saddam Hussein's government seeks
to bolster Iraq's self-image through excavation and rebuilding at
sites like Babylon that symbolize the nation's historical greatness.
   ``By appealing to history, Saddam encourages Iraqis to view
themselves as the heirs of a great civilization that flowered in
ancient Iraq while the surrounding world was lingering in
prehistory,'' a Western diplomat said.
   Iraq includes much of the ``fertile crescent'' of ancient
Mesopotamia where early rulers developed efficient armies and
sophisticated city administrations that rivalled the Pharaohs' Egypt.
   Ruined temples and palaces adorned with colossal stone
sculptures, archives of inscribed clay tablets, delicate goldwork
and ivory carvings illustrate the importance of early Iraqi
civilization.
   To help build morale during the recent eight-year war with
Persian Iran, the Iraqi government recalled Assyrian and Babylonian
victories in the first millennium B.C. against the ancient Persians,
portrayed as unscrupulous aggressors.
   Although the war was halted last August by a United
Nations-mediated cease-fire, history is still being promoted,
underscoring Saddam's drive to boost Iraq's role in the Arab world.
   In addition to the Iraqi teams, archaeologists from the United
States, Britain, Poland, West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan
were digging around the country earlier this year. Most will resume
work in the fall.
   Saddam also agreed in recent talks with American businessmen in
Baghdad, Iraq's capital, that a selection of ancient Iraqi treasures
would tour the United States.
   ``It's clear there's more than scholarship involved in all this
promotion of archaeology ... but the recent finds have been
spectacular,'' said a Western archaeologist, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   New excavations at three sites in the Assyrian heartland of
northern Iraq have unearthed a gold-filled royal tomb dating from
the 8th century B.C., as well as imposing sculpture and
architectural remains.
   At Nimrud, the Assyrian military capital 250 miles north of
Baghdad, Iraqi archaeologists found a stone chamber where two women
were buried along with more than 55 pounds of gold jewelry.
   Muzahem Mahmoud, the excavation director, said it was ``the
richest Assyrian burial known.''
   An inscription on stone in the tomb in wedge-shaped cuneiform
writing identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya, possibly the
daughter and grand-daughter of King Sargon who ruled an empire that
stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.
   The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial
chamber: ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I
pray to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in
the scorching sun after death. ... Let the ghost of insomnia take
hold of him for ever and ever.''
   The gold jewelry included diadems, necklaces, belts, bracelets
and anklets, and 50 pairs of earrings, as well as a bronze mirror
with an enamel handle encrusted in precious stones.
   At Ninevah, the Assyrians' administrative capital, another Iraqi
team unearthed a stone door carved with four lions that was part of
the city's fortifications in its last days.
   They also found arrowheads and skeletons of Assyrian warriors who
may have died during a siege by the Babylonians and Medes. Ninevah
fell in 612 B.C. after holding out for two months and was destroyed.
   Outside the ruins, the archaeologists found remnants of an
irrigation system built by King Sennacherib a century earlier to
increase vegetation around the city, as well as a stone terrace
where he constructed what the tablets call ``a palace without
rival.''
   Farther north near the border with Syria, British archaeologists
tentatively identified a 100-foot high mound as the remains of
ancient Tillule, another important military and religious center.
   The team found the base of a ziggurat, a temple shaped like a
stepped pyramid, that may have belonged to a shrine for the Assyrian
weather god, Adad.
   They also located sections of two roads believed to be part of
highways linking Ninevah with Syria and Turkey.
   ``Everything here tells us that this is a major settlement,''
said excavation director Warwick Ball of the British Museum. ``It's
only a matter of time before we find the clues to tell us that Tel
Al-Hawa is the modern name of Tillule.''
   He said the Assyrians used Tillule as a center for massing troops
before launching campaigns against Syria, Palestine and Egypt.
   At Babylon, whose kings succeeded the Assyrians as rulers of
Mesopotamia, a major project is underway to excavate and restore the
whole nine-square-mile area of the ancient city.
   The multimillion-dollar restoration will include the palace of
King Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th century B.C. king who built the
legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of
the World.
   The city quickly grew into Mesopotamia's largest population
center with around 1 million residents. But Babylonian supremacy
lasted less than a century before the city was overrun by King Cyrus
of Persia in 539 B.C.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein has offered $1.5
million to any Iraqi who can solve a 3,000-year-old puzzle _ how
King Nebuchadnezzar managed to water the fabled Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.
   Archaeologists are divided over whether the gardens, said to have
graced terraces hundreds of feet above the palm-fringed Euphrates,
existed. They reputedly were built by Nebuchadnezzar in the 6th
century B.C. to enchant his homesick queen, the Median princess
Amytis.
   The ancient Greeks considered the gardens one of the seven
wonders of the world, but Nebuchadnezzar made no mention of them in
his detailed writings, and no conclusive evidence they existed has
been uncovered.
   But the Iraqi government, which is rebuilding the city where
Nebuchadnezzar ruled ancient Mesopotamia from 604 B.C. to 562 B.C.,
believes they did exist based on findings by German archaeologists
who first excavated Babylon more than 75 years ago.
   Hussein, who is known as Saddam in Iraq and the Arab world,
announced a $1.5 million prize for whomever comes up with the most
plausible watering system, and $750,000 to the runner-up.
   The winning system likely will be used if the Iraqis decide to go
ahead and reconstruct the hanging gardens as part of their effort to
restore the crumbled city in what is now central Iraq.
   No modern technology can be employed in the watering system, only
the primitive tools available in 6th century B.C. Mesopotamia.
   Hussein said the contest is for Iraqis only and will be judged by
Iraqi archaeologists, but Iraqi embassies around the world
reportedly have been flooded with telephone calls, cables and
letters from foreigners eager to participate.
   Archaeologists have been excavating Babylon for decades but never
have been able to figure out how the Mesopotamians, without modern
pumping systems, watered the gardens that reputedly were on terraces
high above the Euphrates River.
   Legend says the terraced gardens had seven levels, and the most
likely method of watering them was a type of system that hauled
buckets up from the Euphrates.
   Some scientists believe the gardens may have been as high as 365
feet above the ground.
   Officials said scores of Iraqi engineers and architects have
ideas on how the Babylonians did it, but they refuse to give details.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported last month that Leonid
Khasenevich, an engineer from Minsk, claimed to have solved the
mystery and wanted to take part in the Baghdad contest.
   ``A hitherto unstudied hydraulics phenomenon, which I discovered
in 1982, helped me solve this puzzle,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Khasenevich, a hydrologist for 30 years, said that after
experimenting with models, ``I came to the conclusion that parts of
the construction may be unearthed on the Hill of Babel'' near the
biblical tower where God punished the people by making them speak in
different tongues.
   He refused to give details of his findings, but noted: ``I
believe the technology of water inlets was primitive and did not
require large mechanisms, which would have spoiled the beauty of the
famous gardens.''
   Robert Koldewey and Walter Andrae, the German archaeologists who
excavated Babylon before World War I, believed that underground
chambers beneath what were once the towering walls of
Nebuchadnezzar's palace were the foundations of the hanging gardens.
   Georges Roux of France, who spent years in Iraq, wrote in his
book ``Ancient Iraq,'' a respected general history of the country,
that in the cellars beneath the palace, excavators found ``an
unusual well with three shafts, side by side, probably used in
connection with a chain-pump.
   ``It is extremely tempting to see in this construction the
under-structure of the roof gardens, the famous Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.''
   Other experts believe the chambers were for storage and that the
gardens may have been west of the palace in an unexcavated area.
   The Persians destroyed the magnificent city in 539 B.C. What was
left standing crumbled into dust.

<HEAD>Saddam's Babylonian Dream Dashed by Invasion of Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BABYLON, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief archaeologist was picking dates
from a tree to kill time and ease her boredom in the legendary
gardens of Babylon, where Saddam Hussein wants to rebuild one of
the wonders of the ancient world.
   Shafeka Mohammed Jaafar has no work because Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait stalled efforts to restore the glory of Babylon, whose kings
ruled an empire that stretched over most of the Middle East.
   Saddam, the self-styled ``Knight of the Arab nation,'' fancies
himself a modern-day Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's most famous king.
   Iraqi laborers, many of them military reservists, have been
called up to bolster Saddam's army facing more than 330,000
multinational troops massed in the deserts of Saudi Arabia.
   Also, thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian laborers fled Babylon
after the Aug. 2 invasion.
   An estimated $100 million was spent on the project over the last
decade. But funds have became scarce as Saddam juggles a cash
squeeze brought on by the U.N.-supported embargo on Iraqi trade and
oil exports.
   A lone soldier with an AK-47 rifle now stands guard at the
entrance to Nebuchadnezzar's partially rebuilt Babylon.
   ``Before, our president used to visit us regularly, but after he
liberated Kuwait, he has not come even once,'' said Mrs. Jaafar,
47.
   ``He's very busy now fighting Zionist and imperialist forces,''
she added, nibbling at her freshly collected dates.
   More than 2,500 years ago, Babylon rose in the land of
Mesopotamia on the Euphrates River.
   Under Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon entered its golden age. Its
Hanging Gardens, one of the so-called ``seven wonders of the
world,'' long ago crumbled to dust. An artificial lake has been dug
to irrigate the future gardens.
   For 1,200 years, the Babylonians ruled an empire that flourished
as a cultural, religious and commercial center. According to some
traditions, the Garden of Eden in the Bible was in this land
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
   Under Saddam, a new Babylon has begun to rise again.
   An estimated 15 million bricks, baked as they were centuries
ago, have been used to rebuild the city's monuments. The plans are
based on archaeological evidence, cuneiform texts of Babylonian
characters and descriptions from ancient historians.
   Every 100th brick bears the name of Saddam in Arabic proclaiming
the Iraqi leader's efforts to reconstruct Babylon.
   To Saddam and many Iraqi officials, restoring Babylon is more
than an archaeological venture.
   ``After centuries we've got Saddam, a great leader who's going
to restore the past glory of our land. It's only Saddam who can do
that,'' Mrs. Jaafar said as she guided reporters through the ruins
of the 8-square-mile city.
   Iraqis are constantly told that Saddam can restore the lost
glory of Babylon. The state-owned news media and dozens of books
stress that Babylon once controlled the land that is now Iraq,
Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait and Israel.
   Reminders of Saddam are everywhere in Babylon, as they are in
the rest of Iraq.
   On the 55-mile journey from Baghdad south to Babylon, past oil
refineries and anti-aircraft batteries, Saddam's portraits appear
on almost every building, at gasoline stations and fruit stands.
   The road to Babylon branches off the highway before the town of
Hilla. At the entrance to modern Babylon, a small town of one-story
houses, stands a huge portrait of Saddam wearing an Arab keffiyeh
headdress with a white dove of peace fluttering over his head.
   ``Saddam is no ordinary leader and no ordinary president,'' said
Mrs. Jaafar. ``He is the new Nebuchadnezzar.''
   Portraits of Saddam and Nebuchadnezzar are displayed
side-by-side in Babylon and Baghdad.
   In the souvenir shop at Babylon, pamphlets and books carry
portraits of Saddam after the title page. Nebuchadnezzar is hailed
for his dual role as a civilian and military leader.
   The same image is projected in Baghdad in portraits showing
Saddam in fatigues or in Western suits.
   The Iraqi media refers to Saddam as ``father-leader,'' ``hero of
national liberation'' and ``standard-bearer of Islam.''
   Nebuchadnezzar is projected to Iraqis as the defender of the
``Arab nation,'' even though he lived 1,000 years before there was
such a concept.
   Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, took the people of Israel
into captivity for 50 years and fought for years against the
Persians - not unlike Saddam's 1980-88 war with Iran, the
modern-day Persia.
   Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 B.C., 24 years before the city was
captured by the Persians.

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein is invoking the cultural
glories of Iraq's ancient empires and their legendary warrior-kings
like Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon to enhance his claim to be the
new champion of the Arab world.
   The Iraqi president has rewritten history books and purports to
be a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, who founded Islam in the
6th century. He has employed more than 1,000 workers and spent
millions to rebuild Babylon, capital of Nebuchadnezzar's empire.
   Saddam seeks to rally support among the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems and legitimize his crusade against the West and
Israel in their eyes as he finds himself facing a U.S.-led
international quarantine for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Saddam's evocation of Iraq's ancient dynasties has given rise to
suspicions among other Arabs that he harbors imperial ambitions.
   Nebuchadnezzar's empire embraced Kuwait, now gobbled up by Iraq,
and what are now Syria, Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam, 54, has been shrouding himself in the mythology of
Iraq's historical heyday from the 6th century B.C. to the 8th
century to consolidate his power.
   Around this he has created an all-pervasive personality cult.
Huge posters and wall paintings of Saddam in noble pose are
ever-present, as are photos of him on front pages of Iraqi
newspapers.
   A plaque in the Shiite Moslem mosque of Imam Hussein in the holy
city of Karbala in southern Iraq shows a family tree that
supposedly proves that the former peasant boy can trace his lineage
back to Mohammed through the Hashemite kings of Arabia.
   The Information Ministry in Baghdad freely hands out copies,
although the accuracy of the family tree cannot be authenticated
and many non-Iraqi Arabs are highly skeptical of its provenance.
   But to help it along, Saddam has in the last couple of years
rehabilitated the once discredited Hashemite monarchy of Iraq,
overthrown in a 1958 coup and denounced as a British puppet regime.
   Iraqis like to point out that ancient Mesopotamia, in
present-day Iraq, is generally viewed as the cradle of
civilization. Mesopotamis means ``the land between the rivers'' _
the Euphrates and the Tigris.
   Archaeological excavations have produced evidence of settlements
dating from 7,000 B.C. The Garden of Eden is reputed to have been
at Al-Qurna, where the Euphrates and Tigris join.
   Saddam's most ambitious effort to project himself as the new
Nebuchadnezzar has been the resurrection of Babylon, the jewel of
Mesopotamian civilization.
   Saddam began rebuilding Babylon four years ago during the
1980-88 war with Iran. He brought in more than 1,000 laborers from
Sudan to toil in the desert heat on the banks of the Euphrates to
rebuild Nebuchadnezzar's Southern Palace and other parts of the
ruined city, 60 miles north of Baghdad.
   By encouraging Iraqis to steep themselves in the glories of
Babylon, and those of the great Mesopotamian cultures that
flourished around the cities of Nineveh, Nimrud and Ur, Saddam
sought to boost national morale as well as enhance his own dynastic
credentials.
   Nebuchadnezzar was tailor-made for Saddam's grandiose crusade to
portray himself as the savior of the Arabs against Israel.
   The Baylonian king sacked Jerusalem. He took the Children of
Israel into captivity for 50 years and fought for years with the
Persians, ancient enemies of the Arabs.
   Iraqi officials conveniently ignore, however, that the
Achaemenian Persians conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.
   Iraqi history books now refer to Nebuchadnezzar as the defender
of ``the Arab nation,'' even though he lived 1,000 years before
there was such a thing.
   Rebuilding Babylon has cost Iraq millions of dollars while the
country is saddled with a war debt estimated from $50 billion to
$60 billion.
   That does not include the $10 billion owed to Kuwait which the
puppet government Saddam installed there conveniently wrote off.
   Saddam has not restricted himself to identifying with
Nebuchadnezzar. He has likened himself to Hammurabi, who ruled
Babylon in the 17th century B.C. and is credited with drawing up
the world's first written code of law and with razing the cities of
his enemies.
   Mesopotamia was the center of the Parthian empire which emerged
in the 2nd century B.C. and lasted for 400 years. Its capital was
Ctesiphon, whose ruins lie near modern Baghdad.
   The Parthians came later and held back the Romans and the
Byzantine empire until A.D. 637, when they were conquered by the
Arabs sweeping out of the south to spread the new religion of Islam
by the sword.
   In 750, the Abbasids, whose capital was Baghdad, carved out an
Islamic empire stretching from what is now Pakistan to Morocco.
   This was the era of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid, when Baghdad
flowered as the center of Arabic culture and the beguiling city of
the Thousand and One Nights.

<TEXT>
   Songs written 6,000 years ago and deciphered
from stone tablets will waft through this fabled city on Friday as
Babylon relives the ancient days when it was the center of
civilization.
   Tens of thousands of people are expected at the huge cultural
extravaganza planned in Babylon, which is about 55 miles south of
Baghdad.
   The city was rebuilt by President Saddam Hussein at a cost of
about $100 million in an ambitious program to revive the splendors
of the past and to build a tourist industry folowing the eight-year
Persian Gulf war.
   For two weeks, Babylon's reconstructed palaces and temples will
echo with music, opera, dance and drama performed by troupes from
the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and 35 other countries.
   The focuses of the festival will be the 2,500-seat Greek
amphitheater, built in the 4th Century B.C. by Alexander the Great,
who died in Babylon; and the crown hall in the Palace of
Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled in the 6th century B.C.
   ``Babylon was the center of the world's civilization, arts and
culture and it is right that it regain that fame again,'' said Munir
Bashir, chief director of the festival.
   The first festival was held here in 1987, when Iran and Iraq were
at war. Last year's festival was held just a month after the
hostilities ceased under a U.N.-brokered truce.
   An estimated 100,000 people flocked to Babylon for last year's
festival, which featured artists from 24 countries, including
Brazilian guitarist Maria Liva Sao Marcos, the American Jeff Gardner
Jazz Quartet, the Leningrad Ballet and the Glamos Folk Group from
Norway.
   Only a handful of Europeans and Americans attended. But the
Iraqis expect more this year.
   ``Now that the war's over, we expect many more people,'' Bashir
said.
   A highlight, he said, will be an Iraqi troupe's presentation of
songs, dance and music based on ancient Babylonian music.
   The ancient music was played primarily on harps, some of which
have been found in the ruins of the city on the banks of the
Euphrates River.
   Bashir and other Iraqi researchers spent months unraveling the
notations on stone tablets to reproduce the primitive tunes, which
will be performed in public for the first time in millenia.
   Bashir, 59, is director of music at the Ministry of Information
and Culture and is the world's most renowned virtuoso of the oud, an
Arabic stringed instrument that was the forebear of the lute.
   The Iraqis claim that the ancient land known as Mesopotamia, or
``land between the rivers'' _ the Euphrates and Tigris _ was the
``cradle of civilization.'' It is also the reputed site of the
Garden of Eden.
   The Babylonians ruled an empire that flourished as a cultural,
religious and commercial center for hundreds of years. The legal and
social codes they developed were the first to provide for individual
and family rights and have influenced modern legal systems.
   Thousands of Iraqi, Sudanese and Egyptian laborers have toiled in
the blistering heat for the last few years to rebuild the
54,000-square foot Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, the Temples of
Nabashkhari and Ninmakh, the Processional Way, Babylon's main
thoroughfare, and the Ishtar Gate, named after the Babylonians' main
goddess.
   Officials said an estimated 15 million bricks, baked as they were
in ancient times, were used to restore the city's monuments based on
archaeological evidence, cuneiform texts and the description of
historians of the day.
   In other attractions at the festival, the Soviet Union will send
an Azerbaijani dance troupe, the Joyce Trisslet dance troupe is
coming from the United States.
   The amphitheater this year has been equipped with
state-of-the-art technology, including three-dimensional projectors,
to transform the performances at the ancient site into what one
official called ``a journey through time.''

<TEXT>     In time and tradition, the roots of modern Iraq run deep -- all the way
back to the Garden of Eden, which some biblical scholars believe was located
on the swampy plain between the Tigris and Euphrates, near the present-day
city of Basra.;    Here, more than 6,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of
Mesopotamia, Western civilization began to unfold. Here, archaeologists have
found the earliest evidence of organized human society.;    Despite assurances
by President Bush and Pentagon officials that shrines and places of
archaeological significance would be avoided in the air war over Iraq, a grim
reality of the current war is that civilization's ancient treasures occupy
sites of strategic military importance.;    "I don't want it to seem as if I
care more about ancient pottery than I do about people. The human cost of this
war is my greatest concern," says David Stronach, professor of Near East
archaeology at the University of California, Berkeley.;    "But I'm worried
about the ruins of the ancient cities," he says. "The power of the weapons
that are being used is very alarming. Certain mistakes are bound to be made.
There will be losses that we will all regret.";    Over succeeding centuries
in the ancient empires of Sumer, Assyria and Babylonia, great cities were
built and fine art was crafted. The first words were inscribed on soft clay
tablets, the first laws formulated and the first epic poem composed. The
ancient city of Babylon, whose Hanging Gardens were among the wonders of the
world, was also the place centuries later that the Talmud, the great source of
Jewish law, was written. With the rise of Islam also rose Baghdad, a center of
learning and literature.;    Until the invasion of Kuwait ground all
archaeological projects to a halt, Stronach had directed a UC team that was
unearthing the ruins of Nineveh, where the biblical prophet Jonah is believed
to be buried. Nineveh is within the boundaries of the modern-day city of Mosul
in northern Iraq.;    Mosul is also considered to be a prime military target,
home to three air-bases and two weapons manufacturing plants. But it is not
the only military installation that has been built near sacred or historic
sites: A concentration of Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guards is reported
to be south of Ur, legendary birthplace of Abraham. Rocket and ballistic
missile plants are believed to be located at Kerbala, the city sacred to
Shi'ite Muslims as the place where Husayn, grandson of Mohammed, was slain.;  
 Burying treasures;  The city of Samarra, north of Baghdad, where some of the
finest examples of Islamic architecture are preserved, is also the location of
one of Saddam's main weapons plants. And Basra, the legendary site of the
Garden of Eden, is also the location of a major oil refinery.;    One monument
Stronach considers particularly vulnerable is the Arch of Ctesiphon, just
south of Baghdad. Built in 550 A.D. as the main hall of a palace, this soaring
arch is a rare surviving example of the abilities of ancient architects to use
brick as if it were light as air.;    "This is the longest span of any
unsupported baked-brick arch in the world," Stronach says. "One shudders at
the possibility of it being blown to bits.";    Stronach also is concerned
about the fate of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, repository of priceless
treasures, including the cuneiform tablets on which are inscribed the Epic of
Gilgamesh, a poem that is the first written literature in history. Though many
of the holdings of the museum were housed underground during the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war, Stronach and other scholars wonder how the artifacts will fare
under the intense firepower of the technologically superior allied forces.;   
"There are reliefs from the ancient Assyrian civilization, royal tomb
offerings and cuneiform writings that have yet to be deciphered," Stronach
says. "These are the treasures of a priceless civilization that are in a very
real sense the property of all the peoples of the world.";    To Ali Muzafar
Khan, a Shi'ite Muslim from San Jose, the bombing raids threaten not only
precious architecture but the religious leader of many Shi'ites worldwide.;   
The Grand Ayatollah Abolghassen Khoi, the highest ranking Shi'ite Muslim
authority in Iraq, lives in the sacred city of Najaf.;    "We are really,
really scared about his safety and the safety of thousands of Shi'ites who
have gone there to seek refuge," says Khan, who adds that many Muslims have no
illusions about what it will take to oust Saddam Hussein from power.;    "He
is a stubborn man and to win this war will mean the destruction of Iraq. We
are praying for the safety of the people.";    Cultural blackout;  David
Pleins, an archaeologist and professor of religious studies at Santa Clara
University, equates the current blackout of news about civilian casualties in
Iraq with the "cultural blackout" of awareness in many people's minds about
the value of ancient civilizations.;    Such lack of awareness, he says,
allows people to harden themselves to the loss of blood and cultural treasure
that are the consequences of war.;    "We don't understand," Pleins says. "We
don't really know how devastating this is in terms of human life, cultural
life or historical life. There is a complete blackout of understanding.";   
Pleins, who has done most of his research in neighboring Jordan, says that in
the end, archaeology leaves him with an overriding sense of irony.;    "It
seems that we're always studying the engines of war: civilizations that are
built up and brought down with military conflicts," he says. "In the end,
we're left with the enduring legacy of the power of the war machine.";   
Stronach agrees. Before events forced him to leave Iraq, the UC archaeologist
directed a team that unearthed the remnants of an ancient war: skeletons of
soldiers, lances, arrowheads and other weapons. The remains led Stronach to
piece together a theory about how Nineveh, which was ruled by a brutal tyrant,
was defeated in the 6th century B.C. in a relatively brief conflict with the
technologically superior allied armies of Babylonia and Media.;    Stronach,
who expects to return to Iraq and finish his work some day, refrains from
drawing any parallels between the battle of Nineveh and the Persian Gulf war.;
   "But at the very least," he says. "I can appreciate the ironies."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Ancient City In Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have discovered the ruins of an
ancient Mesopotamian city that flourished 4,000 years ago and
rivaled Babylon.
   The site of Mashkan-shapir, 90 miles south of the Iraqi capital
Baghdad, has not been occupied since the city was sacked and burned
about 1720 B.C.
   The city was identified during the first six weeks of
preliminary surveys earlier this year after Elizabeth C. Stone, one
of the archaeologists, discovered a cuneiform inscription on a clay
fragment with the name Mashkan.
   ``We have a whole city plan laid out there for us,'' said Stone,
who, with her husband, Paul Zimansky, identified the site in
January.
   ``We know where the canals were, the cemetery, the palace and
religious quarters, the manufacturing area and the city wall. A
complete, undisturbed city _ that's what's really exciting about it
as an archaeological site,'' Stone said in an interview in The New
York Times today.
   Stone, an associate professor of archaeology at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, and Zimansky, an assistant
professor of archaeology at Boston University, said the city may
rank among the region's major archaeological finds of the past four
decades.
   Other scholars cheered the news of the discovery.
   ``It's always a happy day in archaeology when somewone nails
down the identity of an ancient city,'' said William Hallow,
professor of Assyriology at Yale University.
   Some said the find could be as significant as the 1985 discovery
of Tell Leilan, a northern Mesopotamian center that had been the
seat of a power king in the 18th century B.C. Other archaeologists
doubted that Mashkan-shapir would yield as much as Ebla, an ancient
city in Syria where voluminous archives were discovered in the
1970s and revealed a previously unknown language.
   Stone and Zimansky began exploring the site two years ago,
collecting artifacts on the surface and examining satellite images
of the routes of ancient canals that served the city.
   But they were barred from using aircraft to photograph the site
by Iraqi military restrictions. So Zimansky attached a camera to a
kite to obtain pictures revealing features that were not
immediately visible from the ground.
   The city survived for 300 years as a major trading and
manufacturing center with a population of 15,000. Evidence
indicated that it had been built in honor of Nergal, the ancient
Babylonian god of death, pestilence and other disasters.
   Stone and Zimansky plan more detailed mapping and excavation at
the site next year.

<HEAD>Ancient Winged Bulls Found in Northern Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed seven
2,600-year-old winged bulls and other artifacts in the first major
discovery for many years at the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh,
state television said Sunday.
   Manhal Jabur, chief of archeology in the northern city of Mosul,
was quoted on television as saying the discovery will shed important
light on the Assyrian civilization that extended from the Persian
Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea in the first millennium B.C.
   The television quoted Jabur as saying the discovery was made
several days ago by an Iraqi team in downtown Mosul, close to the
wall of ancient Nineveh.
   The artifacts found in the palace of King Esarhaddon, all
believed to be 2,600 years old, included the huge winged bulls, two
other large statues and other important findings.
   Esarhaddon, who ruled from 681-669 B.C., rebuilt Babylon after it
was conquered and destroyed by his father, Sennacherib.
   The son, known for mastery of both military force and diplomacy,
conquered Egypt, defeated Pharaoh Taharqa and seized his capital,
Memphis.
   Scores of Iraqi and foreign archaeological teams have dug at
Nineveh, about 250 miles north of Baghdad, since British explorer
Henry Layard uncovered huge stone sculptures and inscriptions in the
nearby Assyrian capital of Nimrud in the 1840s.
   Jabur said the seven stone bulls, which were considerably
damaged, were found at the southern gate of Esarhaddon's palace.
   Assyrian kings used winged bulls to decorate the entrances of
their palaces as if they were guards. The seven bulls are marked
with cuneiform inscriptions.
   Jabur said one statue represents a human body that could be the
legendary Sumerian hero Gilgamish. He is holding a lion's head in
his right hand and a sword in his left.
   Other artifacts found in the site were identified as tablets and
inscriptions that could contain important information about the
Assyrian king and his era.

<LEADPARA>  The Bush administration accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Wednesday of
endangering one of the world's most precious archaeological treasures by
parking two warplanes near the ruins of a temple in the ancient city of Ur.;  
 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said the Iraqi military command has placed
the two Soviet-made MiG-21 fighter-bombers "right next to the pyramid" at Ur,
a reference to the famous ziggurat of Ur-Nammu, the king who reigned over the
city-state about 2100 B.C.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ur was the capital of Sumer and the birthplace of the Biblical patriarch
Abraham. Its ziggurat, or temple, is perhaps the most spectacular
archaeological remain in Mesopotamia, the area between the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers known as the cradle of civilization.;    Cheney said the
decision to park the planes by the temple shows that Saddam should bear the
blame for unintended destruction of civilian neighborhoods, cultural sites and
other non-military facilities by allied bombers.;    Cheney, speaking to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the two MiGs were spotted by "satellite imagery
obtained just this morning." Saddam's regime placed the planes at the site
"obviously (in) an effort to use the archaeologically significant facility to
protect his military capabilities," he said.;    Contacted independently, two
specialists in Near Eastern archaeology confirmed that for several years
Saddam has placed military installations and equipment near ancient cultural
sites.;    Augusta McMahon, an archaeological researcher at the University of
Chicago, said Ur is bordered by and partly covered by Tellil, a military
airfield west of Nasiriyah, Iraq, a modern riverfront city. Both the modern
city and the airfield have been targets of allied bombing.;    McGuire Gibson,
professor of Mesopotamian archaeology at the University of Chicago, said he
last visited the Ur site a decade ago and noted that the airfield was about a
mile from the remains of the ziggurat.;    Gibson and McMahon expressed
concern that most of the archaeological sites left by successive ancient
civilizations that flourished in the area are now at risk, partly because many
are surrounded by cities, factories and other possible targets.;    For
example, in an area of northern Iraq once known as Assyria, the site of the
ancient city of Nineveh is surrounded by the modern industrial suburbs of
Mosul. McMahon, who has been to digs at Nineveh in recent years, said Mosul's
main oil storage tank is "right on a partially excavated tell (mound) next to
the palace of the Assyrian kings.";    Located nearby, said Gibson, is the
partly excavated throne room of Sennacherib, an Assyrian king. Covered by a
corrugated metal roof, the large oblong structure contains a number of
priceless relief carvings still affixed to the original walls.;    "That could
have been targeted as a storage shed," Gibson said. "I'm sure the oil tank has
been hit.";    McMahon said a rumor swept through the large Iraqi-American
population in Detroit in recent days that a massive brick arch in a
third-century palace in Ctesiphon, some 20 miles south of Baghdad, had fallen
in the bombing. But there has been no corroboration so far, she said.;   
Gibson said he was apprehensive about what he assumed was a lack of knowledge
on the part of U.S. military planners about Iraq's rich archaeological legacy.  </TEXT>

 -- Inscription at Babylon 
</P>
<P>
The tour guide at a reconstructed palace in Babylon described with enthusiasm 
the restored monuments of the ancient city -- the lion sculpture, the brick 
reliefs of bulls and griffins, the newly planted hanging gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Then she got to the throne room and, with a sweep of her hand, pointed to the 
empty platform. "This is where the leader Saddam Hussein had his throne. This 
is where Saddam Hussein sat," she said, voice rising in pride. 
</P>
<P>
The short, stout woman looked around at the quizzical faces, then caught 
herself with a nervous laugh. "I mean Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar. 
Nebuchadnezzar had his throne here." 
</P>
<P>
The guide could be forgiven for the gaffe, for even here at this 4,000-year-old 
site on the banks of the slow-moving Euphrates, the handwriting on the wall 
says that Saddam Hussein is Iraq's ruler for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, Iraq's president and self-described leader of the Arab world, has 
created for himself a regional personality cult unrivaled in the world of the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon creates a landscape in itself. Giant portraits decorate plazas, 
traffic circles and government and private buildings throughout the country. 
His mustachioed face greets you at the airport in black-and-white photos, at 
the currency exchange desk on color calendars, on roadside signs on 
superhighways into Baghdad, at hotel entrances, in government offices. (In the 
Information Ministry, one office has four portraits placed so that no matter 
which way you turn, he is there.) Television offers no escape: The nightly news 
relentlessly begins with reports of the president's daily activity. 
Neighborhoods are named after him. Sports arenas. Schools. Bridges. A slice of 
newly annexed Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
To view these images is to gaze at a conception of power and, in no small way, 
to get a glimpse of the national obsessions of one of the Middle East's most 
fractious societies. 
</P>
<P>
The fatherly image that dominates the personality cult clashes with the violent 
means that Hussein used to achieve and keep power. The assassinations, 
executions, jailings and persecution of political opponents have made it all 
but impossible for anyone to challenge Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
As for the image, wrote Middle East expert Frederick W. Axelrod in his book 
"The New Iraq," "Clumsy and rigid as they are, such attempts to inundate Iraq's 
political culture with the image of its energetic leader have, by their sheer 
weight, imposed on the public mind the suggestion that there is no true 
alternative to Saddam Hussein's leadership in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
In his countless public portraits, Hussein is presented as a man of the people 
-- of all the people in this ethnically and religiously split land. Sometimes 
he is shown as fatherly, with a child bouncing on his knee, sometimes wearing a 
Western suit for the benefit of businessmen and bureaucrats. Sometimes he is 
the desert chieftain in flowing robes, the hunter with Tyrolean hat and 
shotgun, the dandy in Panama hat and open shirt, the farmer in shirtsleeves 
trading chitchat with craggy-faced peasants, the statesman sitting in the gilt 
presidential chair. 
</P>
<P>
He is up to date, depicted standing in front of a futuristic landscape of 
skyscrapers or in a series of pop art portraits a la Andy Warhol. He is 
eternal, as in Babylon, where a billboard has him sharing a scene with 
Nebuchadnezzar near the tower of Babel. 
</P>
<P>
For Iraq's Shiite Muslim population, whose loyalty to a state dominated by a 
Sunni Muslim minority was long suspect, Hussein is revealed on posters at 
prayer, on a rug, palms up in a gesture of supplication, eyes looking to 
heaven. The image is striking given the secular nature of the quasi-socialist 
Arab Baath Socialist Party that Hussein leads. 
</P>
<P>
As a sop to Iraq's restive Kurdish population, Hussein poses in a blue robe and 
turban typical of Kurdistan. 
</P>
<P>
The personality cult flowered during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran, a 
conflict that began in 1980 and took hundreds of thousands of lives on each 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The war, initially a conflict over the waterway formed by the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers, became thoroughly identified with Hussein. Iraqis came to 
refer to the conflict as a new version of the ancient war between Mesopotamia, 
the historical forerunner of Iraq, and Persia, which was to become Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Military portraits are the most common homage to Hussein. He's a paratrooper in 
beret, an infantryman in helmet, a much-decorated officer holding a ceremonial 
saber. 
</P>
<P>
One painting shows him standing in front of a battlefield replete with chariots 
and bowmen. 
</P>
<P>
Such heavy-handed efforts to link Hussein's dictatorship with Iraq's past is 
one of the most striking themes of his self-aggrandizement. He tries to line up 
not only with the most ancient of rulers, but also with more recent ones who 
until just a year ago were viewed as corrupt pawns of foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he rehabilitated Faisal I, who led the Arab Revolt against Turkish 
rule in World War I. Faisal had been promised rule over Syria by his British 
allies but was betrayed and given Iraq as a consolation prize. Last year, 
Hussein renovated Faisal's tomb, along with those of other members of the royal 
Hashemite family, and he restored an equestrian statue of Faisal to a Baghdad 
square. 
</P>
<P>
The Hashemites were overthrown in a bloody coup in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has not stopped at just reviving the Hashemites' dignity; he has 
decided to join them, in a way. Conveniently, a family tree has been discovered 
in the southern town of Kerbala that purports to show that Hussein, just like 
the deposed monarchy, is related to the Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
Even Jordan's King Hussein, a Hashemite but no kin to Saddam Hussein, has 
started calling the Iraqi leader "cousin." 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein makes much of his tenuous contact with another Arab hero -- 
Saladin, the Medieval nemesis of the Crusaders. Both came from the same 
village, Tikrit, north of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
No ruler in ancient Mesopotamia is beyond association with Hussein. In the 
basement of the Martyr's Monument, a massive Baghdad shrine to the Persian Gulf 
War dead in the form of a split Oriental dome, a new exhibit traces Hussein's 
life in photos. There's the wattle hut where he was born, photos of him as a 
jug-eared schoolboy who got high marks in school in singing and history, of a 
gangly teen with only a hint of the mustache that would flourish later in life, 
of an underground revolutionary who tried to kill a prime minister and fled 
into exile, of a hunted nationalist exile in a variety of disguises, of a 
smiling leader with wife and baby.

<HEAD>In a War, Ur Becomes a Target</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If war comes to Iraq, it also comes to what's
below the surface there: the civilizations of Mesopotamia, the
cities of Babylon and Ur, ancient places where humanity learned to
write, to raise wheat and barley, domesticate animals and live in
cities.
   But archaeologists are surprisingly sanguine about the safety of
artifacts buried under the sands in Iraq's vast desert.
   Thousands of unexcavated sites and millions of clay tablets
whose writings have yet to be interpreted will survive, even if
Iraq and Kuwait turn into a battleground, these scientists say.
   ``Obviously, if war comes, there will be unexpected damage, but
I don't think it will be calamitous with regard to archaeological
sites'' except those near modern cities or other potential targets,
said Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
and an eminent archaeologist known for his years of research in
Mesopotamia's ruins.
   Among the potential targets, however, is the city of Ur, built
on the banks of the Euphrates at the dawn of history and said to be
the birthplace of Abraham, the biblical patriarch.
   What sits atop of Ur now is a major Iraqi airfield, almost
certain to be targeted in a war.
   And the fabled city of Babylon, dating back to 3000 B.C., is
just north of modern Hilla, an industrial city. A stray bomb
intended for Hilla could shatter Babylonian artifacts.
   Like most sites in Iraq, these two retain their secrets despite
150 years of research. Only a fraction of what is to be found has
been uncovered, Adams said.
   ``We probably have some knowledge, other than having walked over
the surface, of less than 1 percent, and it may be one-tenth of 1
percent, of the existing sites,'' he said. ``I myself must have
mapped 5,000 mounds or something in that neighborhood.
   ``So the treasures there to be unearthed over thousands of years
to come are enormous.''
   The prospect of war - and of Islamic hostility to Westerners -
raises doubts about the future of work in Jordan, Syria and
elsewhere in the region. The Iran-Iraq war and the Iranian
revolution of the Ayatollah Khomeini halted research in Iran.
   The threat of war raises greater concern about the safety of
antiquities stored in such places as the ``spectacular'' museum in
Baghdad, according to archaeologist Elizabeth Stone of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook.
   ``A direct hit would be catastrophic,'' she said.
   Stone is optimistic, however. She noted that on three occasions
during the Iran-Iraq war, when it seemed likely that Baghdad would
be bombed, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had priceless objects
moved out of harm's way.
   Saddam - who sometimes portrays himself as a latter-day
Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th century B.C. Babylonian ruler - is well
aware of the value of antiquities in ``fostering a time-depth in
the consciousness of the people,'' said Guy Van Beek, a Smithsonian
archaeologist who has worked in the Mideast for nearly three
decades.
   Van Beek said Saddam has been ``extraordinarily active'' in
encouraging excavations ``even given all his problems with war with
Iran.''
   ``It is always possible that a pitched battle can take place on
a site'' or that a general can decide an excavation would be a good
place from which to stage an ambush, he said.
   But short of those quirky events, he said, most archaeological
sites are far from cities or targets and unlikely to be in danger
of wartime destruction. The vast majority are 30, 40 or 50 feet
below the surface.
   Peacetime economic development - the flooding of a valley or
damming of a river - is generally more destructive to archaeology
than war, Van Beek said.
   And in wartime, he said, random bombing is likely to be less
destructive than the loss or looting of equipment and records and
the destruction of artifacts that already have been brought to the
surface.
   War, of course, brings the frustration of disrupting work that
may have finally begun to pay off after decades of digging.
Archaeologists sometimes wait in vain for decades to return to a
former worksite rather than starting anew elsewhere, he said.
   When Saddam seized Kuwait Aug. 2, no Western archaeologists were
known to have been stranded. Work had stopped during the hot
summer.
   Before the invasion, Stone was able to put in only three seasons
of work at the ``lost city'' of Mashkan-shapir which she and
colleagues discovered in Iraq. Some 3,700 years ago, she said, it
was ``one of the world's 10 most important cities.''
   Now she has no idea when she will be able to resume digging.
   ``We were just beginning to get a real understanding of the way
in which those cities worked,'' she said.

civilization started. Now, American planners, wary lest the fighting sweep
away treasures of the ancient world, are turning to an expert for advice.;

<TEXT>     Since then, one of the scholars, Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, has been asked by the government for information on
what sites to avoid as Operation Desert Storm sweeps through southern Iraq.;  
 "It is my understanding that they asked him for information and he supplied
that information," Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said Tuesday. "I
don't know what the specific information was and I don't know if it was the
CIA. It was government officials.";    Archaeologists who have worked in
southern Iraq are holding their breath and hoping that war will not shatter
too badly the treasures there that still inspire wonder and contain clues to
mysteries lingering over the dawn of civilization.;    "Iraq is one big
archaeological site," said Donald Hansen of New York University, who has been
excavating there for 35 years and would be digging now if it weren't for the
war. "None of us know anything specifically, but one can only assume, with all
that bombing, that some things have been damaged.";    Some scholars think
future generations will look upon anyone who destroys Iraq's buried history as
barbarians. And they suggested as much in their letter to Bush, though
couching the sentiment more gingerly.;    In World War II, allied bombers
spared German-occupied Paris, "the city of light," and avoided hitting such
rich repositories as the Vatican in Rome and the emperor's palace in Tokyo.;  
 "I suspect if we were making war on Egypt, we would be a lot more reverent,"
said the University of Chicago's McGuire Gibson. No one would dare bomb King
Tut's tomb or the pyramids, he said.;    Since 1964, Gibson has been digging
at Nippur, which for 6,000 years was the seat of the Mesopotamian religion,
"what Rome is to Catholics.";    Ten or 15 yards beneath the sands of Iraq are
perhaps half a million sites, including 100 or 200 ancient cities, most still
uncovered. They are the stuff of history yet to be recorded.;    They offer to
tell what life was like in the place where Judeo-Christian ideas were first
conceived, where the human race learned to write, to codify law, to raise
crops and animals, where Abraham was born and where both Jonah and the whale
are said to be buried.;    Gibson said scholars could list 20 crucial places
that should be spared. Because no damage has been reported at the excavations
at Babylon, near the industrial city of Hilla, he thinks allied commanders
have declared that site off limits.;    Gerrold Cooper of Johns Hopkins
University is sensitive to the perception that his profession worries more
about what the war is doing to objects than to people.;    Not so, he said,
but "we worry about the material damage because this is where we work; this is
our career.";    Elizabeth Stone of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook said she still was worried. No one can wave the allies away from bombing
Agade, capital of the first Mesopotamian empire, she said, because Agade
hasn't been located yet.;    "But if we want to know how the Mesopotamians
solved the problem of ruling not just a city-state but a population that
stretched from Iraq to the Mediterranean -- a huge empire -- that is the one
site that would tell us," she said.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Gold-Stuffed Tomb Unearthed at Nimrud in Northern Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed the
gold-stuffed tomb of two women in what appears to be the richest
discovery ever made at ancient Nimrud in northern Iraq.
   The 2,700-year-old tomb in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II
contained more than 55 pounds of gold jewelery including diadems,
necklaces, earrings, belts and anklets, the English-language
Baghdad Observer reported Friday.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, carried
details of the newspaper report.
   Nimrud, a sprawling site 250 miles north of Baghdad, was a major
city of the Assyrian empire that extended from the Persian Gulf to
the Mediterranean in the first millennium B.C.
   Ashurnasirpal II was a ruthless but brilliant military leader
who built the vast palace at Nimrud in the 9th century B.C.
   Scores of Iraqi and foreign archaeological teams have dug at
Nimrud in a century-and-a-half of excavations since British
explorer Henry Layard uncovered huge stone sculptures and
inscriptions there in the 1840s.
   The explorers included British archaeologist Max Mallowan, the
husband of author Agatha Christie, who excavated close to the newly
found tomb between 1949 and 1958.
   Some of Layard's and Mallowan's finds are displayed in the
British Museum in London, as well as in Iraq's national museum in
Baghdad.
   Muzahem Mahmoud, the Iraqi archaeologist who made the new
discovery, said an inscribed stone tablet found in the
32-by-14-foot burial chamber identified one of the women as Yabaya
of the Assyrian royal court, the newspaper reported.
   The inscription in wedge-shaped cuneiform script also placed a
curse on anyone who opened the tomb.
   ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb, or opens my grave, or
steals my jewelery, I pray to the gods of the nether world that his
soul shall roam in the scorching sun after death...Let the ghost of
insomnia take hold of him for ever and ever,'' it said.
   The other woman was identified only as a much younger person
named Taliya, the newspaper said.
   Yabaya's possessions included gold needles, a bronze mirror with
its enamel handle encrusted with precious stones, and tiny tongs
for applying kohl, a dark eye makeup, the paper said.
   ``We found more than 100 earrings beside her skull, some small,
some large. She had all her personal belongings buried with her in
the grave,'' Mahmoud said.
   The report said that rich royal tombs had been unearthed at
Ashur, another Assyrian city, but none contained as many precious
objects as the Nimrud grave.
   It said that although the Assyrian empire is well-documented,
there are few references to the role of women at the royal court.
   However, Queen Semiramis is known to have ruled Assyria for five
years at the end of the 9th century B.C.

   Tawfic Sofer, a retired cloth merchant and
caretaker of Baghdad's main synagogue, peered through the makeshift
peephole of an iron gate 10 feet high.
   When ordered by two government officials, from State Security
and the Information Ministry, the 65-year-old Iraqi Jew unlocked
the gate and swung it open.
   ``Welcome, welcome,'' he said several times in Arabic, his eyes
on the cars parked outside.
   Satisfied that the officials were alone, except for a foreign
reporter, he guided the group to the synagogue.
   President Saddam Hussein's government sometimes allows visits by
Western news media to the synagogue in downtown Baghdad, but
requires Iraqi officials to accompany them for ``security reasons''
that are not explained.
   Reporters are discouraged from visiting the synagogue on the
Jewish Sabbath, which runs from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
   Reminders of Saddam are omnipresent in Iraq, and the synagogue
is no exception. His portrait is on two calendars that hang on the
wall at the entrance.
   The square, white two-story synagogue was built in 1942 in the
middle of a bazaar.
   Its walls are covered with Scriptures written in Hebrew and
there are many shelves of old books. The synagogue's Torah scrolls,
the handwritten five books of Moses that form the foundation of the
Jewish faith, are on a raised platform, concealed by a black and
gold curtain.
   ``It is a very rich collection,'' said Sofer, a bachelor who
gave up his business to tend the synagogue after the last caretaker
died two years ago. ``We are fine and we do not want war. We are a
very small community, but we are surviving.''
   About 600 Jews live in Baghdad, 200 more in the port city of
Basra, 100 in the northern city of Mosul and 100 or so in other
areas of Iraq, he said.
   Iraq had a flourishing Jewish community of doctors, lawyers,
professors and businessmen with 65 synagogues when Iraq gained
political independence from Britain in 1932.
   Only two synagogues still function. More than 120,000 Iraqi Jews
moved to Israel soon after the Jewish state was born in 1948.
   Sofer said his ancestors and those of most Iraqi Jews came to
Baghdad from Babylon centuries ago. More than 2,500 years ago, King
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Jerusalem and carried the
captive Children of Israel back to the land between the Tigris and
the Euphrates rivers.
   Saddam often is compared with Nebuchadnezzar in the Baghdad of
today. Iraqi officials describe the Jews of Babylon as an ancient
Fifth Column who helped Persian invaders take the city.
   According to the oft-told story, which does not appear in the
Bible, the Babylonian Jews advised King Cyrus to destroy dams on
the Euphrates, thus lowering water levels in moats around the city
so his troops could enter.
   ``We do have problems,'' Sofer said of Baghdad's remaining Jews.
He paused, looked at the Iraqi officials and continued:
   ``Our problems are marriages. We don't have enough young men to
marry. We have at least 25 girls ready to marry, but there are not
enough eligible men.''
   Sofer said Iraqi Jews hav  only one shohet, the butcher who
slaughters animals and prepares the meat according to ancient
Jewish law.
   ``It is a big problem, but we are trying to solve it,'' Sofer
said. ``He has to work overtime. There is no other way. When he is
sick, we have a major problem.''
   ``We are very lucky'' that two rabbis serve Baghdad, he said.
   Like all Iraqis interviewed, of whatever faith, Sofer would not
say if people live in fear of Saddam.
   When asked whether he feared persecution if the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia attacked in an effort to force
Iraq out of Kuwait, he said: ``We pray there is no war.''
   ``The people here do not trust us, but we are not bothered. But
if there is war, we may face problems.'' Sofer refused to
elaborate.
   Iraq, a predominantly Moslem country, denies any persecution of
Jews.
   ``We have Jewish people studying in university,'' said an
Information Ministry official, who cannot be named under government
regulations. ``They are also in business.''
   He said Jewish businessmen, like their Moslem counterparts, were
free to travel outside Iraq.
   Saddam's government, however, carries on a regular propaganda
program to ``expose the Zionist movement's imperialist goals.''

<LEADPARA>  Is the Persian Gulf war the ultimate voyage toward a fiery end before a

nationwide.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Many pastors are trying to address it directly, and mostly calmly, with
answers straight out of the Bible.;    Some evangelicals, such as author and
scholar the Rev. Charles Dyer, see evidence of "the three signposts" found in
the Bible that Armageddon is near.;    "First, Israel must be in existence,
which was put in place in 1948. Second, world power must be revived in the
boundaries of the ancient Roman Empire, which we see beginning in the
realignment of European nations," Dyer said. "And third, Babylon must be
rebuilt.";    But instead of declaring, as does Revelation 16:17, "It is
over," many televangelists, "end-time" scholars and pastors are qualifying
their sermons, saying the current conflict might be a "foreshadowing,"
"prelude" or "preview" to the final conflagration -- but not the main event.; 
  "A lot of us are aware, watching and alerted to what's happening," said Greg
Laurie, a radio evangelist in Southern California.;    "After all, any time
something happens in the Middle East where the security of Israel is
threatened, it could tip the first domino of the prophetic calendar.";   
Shortly after the war erupted last month, Laurie began reviewing the Book of
Revelation, the prophetic story that details the world's last days, with his
Monday night Bible study class at the Calvary Chapel in Santa Ana.;    Laurie,
like many others, does not go too far out on a limb.;    "I'm not the kind of
person that makes statements that put me out there," he said. "I'm not a
prophet, and we have to be careful that we don't eat our words in two
months.";    America's 50 million evangelical Christians interpret Bible
stories as containing varying degrees of prophecy. Some see these rich and
vivid stories as highly metaphorical, to be read for their moral value and
sagacity.;    Yet there always have been those who combed the Bible,
particularly in the books of Daniel, Revelation and Ezekiel, for detailed
scenarios of the prophetic panorama, scrutinizing them not only for their
lessons about good and evil but also for times, dates and locations of
upcoming events.;    Over time, some have even pinpointed the "end time,"
naming Hitler, Mussolini and even former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as
the Antichrist who would drive civilization over the brink. These days,
however, only a few venture to be that specific.;    Among those who interpret
the Bible literally, speculation has been focused on the words of the enemy
himself.;    Although Iraqi President Saddam Hussein takes his cues from
Islam, he has startled many Christians with his religious imagery -- such as
when he said after the first allied air strike on Baghdad that it would lead
to "the mother of all battles" or when he said he had rebuilt Iraq to the
glory of ancient Babylon and likened himself to Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian
king who destroyed Jerusalem in the sixth century B.C.;    "The Bible does say
that Babylon will be revealed in last days," Laurie said. "Could this be
Babylon actually being rebuilt?";    The Rev. Ezra Williams, senior pastor of
the Bethel Assembly Gospel Church in Harlem, said his Sunday services have
been flooded not only with people who are questioning "the Bible relevancy" of
Operation Desert Storm but also by those who feel unable to cope with the
increasing economic turmoil.;    "I tell my people that we are living in a
crucial time in history when nations are positioning for the final battle of
Armageddon and they must do what they can for their brothers and sisters,"
Williams said. "But I don't say when it will happen. I just feel we must be
ready.";    In a poll taken a week after the war started, the Gallup
organization asked 1,011 people in telephone interviews whether they thought
this battle would be Armageddon: 15 percent said yes; 74 percent answered no;
11 percent were unsure.;    Yet so many people are wondering that popular
books about biblical prophecy are outselling more secular treatises about the
troubled region. In the last 10 weeks, 600,000 copies of John F. Walvoord's
recently updated "Armageddon, Oil and the Middle East Crisis" have been sold;
300,000 more copies are being distributed by evangelist Billy Graham.;   
Walvoord, 80, is considered the leading scholar of this very dramatic school
of biblical prophecy and was for many years the head of the Dallas Theological
Seminary, long an academic center of literalist study.;    Besides Walvoord,
Dyer, professor and dean of enrollment at Dallas Theological Seminary, has
seen this attention translate into "best-selling author" status.;    Dyer's
"The Rise of Babylon: Sign of the End Times," focuses on Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's efforts to rebuild the city of Babylon. Tyndale House
Publishers reports 129,000 copies of the book were distributed since its
release on Jan. 15, the deadline by which Hussein was to withdraw from Kuwait
or face U.S. military force.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   In a little mud-brick room on the ruins of
old Nimrud, north of Baghdad, an ordinary-looking Engishwoman
retired each day from the fierce Assyrian sun to plot murder.
   Locals on the archaeological dig knew the woman as Mrs.
Mallowan, a photographer. But the books she wrote in the crude
little room bore another name.
   Agatha Christie.
   As her archaelogist husband, Sir Max Mallowan, helped chart the
dawn of history in the desert hills, Miss Christie sat among
Mesopotamian relics and conjured cases for the fictional detectives
of her mystery novels.
   Her years after World War II at Nimrud, one of the great cities
of the Assyrian empire in 1400-600 B.C., capped decades of Middle
Eastern travel and archaeological work that left traces scattered
throughout her 77 books.
   Miss Christie first arrived in the Middle East in 1907, aged 17,
for her debutante season in Cairo, Egypt.
   ``We spent three months there and I went to five dances every
week,'' she recalled in an autobiography in 1965.
   She later set at least two novels in Egypt: ``Death on The
Nile'' and ``Death Comes As the End,'' a tale of love and murder in
the Thebes of 2000 B.C.
   A deeper relationship with the area began in the 1930s when she
took the Orient Express across Europe to Turkey and continued on by
train and car across the wild Syrian desert to Baghdad.
   There she met Mallowan. They spent most of the next 20 years
bouncing between Britain and archaeological digs in Iraq and Syria.
   ``She was very unprepossessing to look at,'' said the Iraqi
writer and critic Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, who first met her in 1949.
   ``She was a very charming woman to talk to, very attentive ...
with a dry sense of humor. You wouldn't know she was the great
Agatha Christie.''
   Jabra said she lived with Mallowan in the former home of King
Ali on the bank of the Tigris River. The house and its surroundings
made a cameo appearance in her 1951 spy novel, ``They Came to
Baghdad'':
   ``There was the persistent honking of motor horns, the cries of
vendors of various wares. There were hot disputes between small
groups of people who seemed ready to murder each other but were
really fast friends.''
   All of that seems true today, although the donkeys, horses and
mud-brick homes she described in the book are rapidly giving way to
Brazilian-made Volkswagens and concrete high-rises.
   The dusty, bouncing road to Babylon she recounts in that novel
is now a smooth highway.
   And the ``meaningless pile of ruined mud and burnt brick'' she
found there has been resurrected into a freshly whitewashed
reconstruction of King Nebuchadnezzar's 6th century B.C. capital.
   Baghdad's Rashid Street is still a major downtown thoroughfare,
as it was when Miss Christie first visited, although some of its
fancier buildings have decayed.
   The Tigris Palace Hotel where Miss Christie stayed still stands,
although she would never recognize the remodeled and cut-rate Ibn
Haitham as the graceful hotel that figured in her 1935 book,
``Murder in Mesopotamia.''
   British and American expatriates in Baghdad still gather weekly
in a play-reading circle that claims Miss Christie as an early
member.
   Archaeologists at the British Expedition office in Baghdad say
some of their furnishings are rumored to have once graced her
living room.
   Her mud-brick workroom still stands at Nimrud, although it's now
used as a storage room.
   The creator of the prim and proper Miss Marple has even had the
honor of a banned book. Her remembrances of life on the digs,
``Come, Tell Me How You Live,'' was blocked by Iraqi censors
because it was considered to be ``derogatory.''
   Miss Christie is still remembered at the charming but decrepit
Baron's Hotel in Aleppo, Syria, where she reportedly worked on
several books.
   But the owners of the Orient Palace Hotel in Damascus, the
Syrian capital, where she stayed on her first visit to the region,
did not recall her.
   The once-elegant hotel still has the marble floors and dim
lights she described. But paint peels from the hallway walls and
portraits of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini peer sternly out
from the front windows.
   The Orient Palace now accommodates the families of Iranians
killed in the war with Iraq who are flown to Damascus on state-paid
vacations.
   The Nabatean ruins at Petra in Jordan, backdrop for
``Appointment With Death,'' are no longer, as Miss Christie wrote,
``a full day's motor run across the desert'' from Amman, the
kingdom's capital.
   But Petra itself _ ``as real as _ as raw beef,'' she described
it _ remains the same.
   Writer-critic Jabra said most of Miss Christie's books are about
``the English in a foreign country'' and had little to do with the
locals.
   ``Her geographical descriptions are quite good, but her contact
with Iraqis was limited,'' he said.
   But he added she was ``very well-liked by Iraqis who knew her.''
She returned that affection in her autobiography.
   ``How much I have loved that part of the world,'' she wrote. ``I
love it still and I always shall.''

   Treasures even greater than those in King
Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said Zahi Hawass, director
of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient
cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's
buried. After all, Egypt is 97 percent desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut _ was found almost
intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist Howard Carter.
   It took Carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern Egypt's Valley of the
Kings.
   But Tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient Egypt's great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of Pharaoh Cheops, whose pyramid on Giza
Plateau is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at Sakkara, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the New
Kingdom, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C. Records say he wanted to be
buried in Egypt's Siwa Oasis, near Libya, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in Alexandria, the Mediterranean city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to Siwa to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said Sayed
Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As Egypt's population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in Egypt generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director Hawass said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September.
   In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of Luxor Temple. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is Giza Plateau's East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
Cheops pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
Hawass said.
   ``In Sakkara, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, Hawass said. These caches, which may explain the
Luxor Temple statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh Cheops, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is Cheops' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' Hawass said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after Cheops) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the Luxor find the Cheops discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of Cheops' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in Alexandria.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but Alexandria has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

<HEAD>Queen's Gold-stuffed Coffin Found In Ancient Nimrud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stone coffin filled with gold jewelry was
unearthed by archaeologists in the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud,
the official Iraqi News Agency reported Saturday.
   It was the second discovery of a gold-laden burial in Nimrud
this year.
   The agency quoted Muadad Saeed, Iraq's director of antiquities,
as saying the find included ``hundreds of gold ornaments and pieces
of jewelry.''
   He said they were believed to belong to Queen Ninli Shomi
Marmani, the wife of King Assirnasurpal II, who ruled from 884-858
B.C.
   The coffin was found 13 feet below ground and tablets in
wedge-shaped cuneiform writing also were associated with the royal
burial, Saeed said.
   Nimrud, the military capital of the ancient Assyrian empire that
stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, is 25 miles
south of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
   In April, Iraqi archaeologists unearthed a stone chamber at
Nimrud that contained the burials of two women accompanied by 55
pounds of gold jewelry. A stone inscription in the tomb in
cuneiform writing identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya,
possibly the daughter and grand-daughter of King Sargon, who ruled
Assyria in the 8th century B.C.
   The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the
burial chamber.
   ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I pray
to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in the
scorching sun after death ... Let the ghost of insomnia take hold
of him for ever and ever,'' it said.
   The gold jewelery included necklaces, belts, brcelets, anklets
and 50 pairs of earrings.

its original site while digging around to make bricks.;    The tablet contains
19 names in cuneiform script and is written in Akkadian, a language of
commerce and politics of the time. Each name is preceded by an amount of

dramatic account in the book of Joshua, the leader first defeated a coalition
of city-states led by Jabin, King of Hazor.;    Then, according to Joshua
11:10-11, Joshua "turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king
thereof with the sword . . . and he burnt Hazor with fire. . . . But for the
cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only
-- that did Joshua burn."  </TEXT>

   The gathering of nations to the brink of war in
the Middle East is a sign some evangelical leaders believe may
herald the most feared and sought-after age in Christianity -
Armageddon and the Second Coming.
   At least one fundamentalist television evangelist believes God
may call all born-again Christians up to heaven at any day. That
would usher in a seven-year period of destruction that only a third
of the world's population would survive before Christ comes to rule
over a world in which the lion will lay down with the lamb and
swords will be beaten into plowshares.
   ``Saddam Hussein is just kind of an activator bringing it all
together,'' said the Rev. Charles Taylor, host of the syndicated
television show ``Today in Bible Prophecy.'' ``It's time to rejoice
for the Christians. We're going home.''
   What has caused the current revival in speculation of the end
time is the resurgence of Babylon in the form of modern-day Iraq.
The ruins of the ancient city lie 60 miles south of present-day
Baghdad.
   Several of the Bible's prophetic books, including Isaiah,
Revelation and Ezekiel, refer to the rise and fall of Babylon. Some
believe Babylon's rise today may be the precursor of the final
battle between the Lord and the enemies of Israel, and the coming
of the savior to rule over the world.
   Few evangelicals are ready to don white robes and implore people
on street corners to ``Repent, the end is near!'' But some are
saying Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and menacing stance toward Israel
point toward the the final conflict between good and evil.
   ``I would not predict we are near the end of the age, although I
personally think we are,'' evangelist Billy Graham said.
   Religious movements built around predictions of Christ's Second
Coming have long been a part of U.S. religious history.
   In the 19th century, the Rev. William Miller caused thousands of
Americans to prepare for the Lord's Coming. Even after his
predicted dates in the 1840s passed by uneventfully, his work laid
the foundation for the Seventh-Day Adventist movement. Later in the
century, Jehovah's Witnesses grew into a national movement amid
similar predictions.
   More recently, some thought former President Reagan's foreign
policy, particularly his hawkish view of Soviet Union, may have
been based on a belief in biblical warnings of Armageddon being
started by invaders from the north.
   Saddam has done little to discourage speculation he may trigger
the final conflict. Seeking to exploit his nation's past glories,
the Iraqi leader has spent millions to rebuild Babylon. He also has
portrayed himself as the new Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian
warrior-king who sacked Jerusalem in the 6th century B.C.
   In seeking greater Arab support for his invasion of Kuwait,
Saddam also has spoken in increasingly ominous terms about Israel.
   ``History has gone full circle and we are coming back to these
lands,'' Graham said during a recent crusade. ``This is not another
Korea, it is not another Vietnam - it is something far more
sinister and far more difficult.''
   ``The circumstances are such that we see the culmination of
God's plan for planet Earth,'' said the Rev. Paul Schenck of New
Covenant Tabernacle, a large Assemblies of God church in suburban
Buffalo, N.Y.
   He added that he has mixed feelings about the possibility - ``I
will not be disappointed if my children grow up and I see my
great-grandchildren.''
   Most mainline biblical scholars give little credence to such
speculation. They say such analysis takes out of context biblical
passages that were written in a specific culture and time for
different teaching purposes.
   Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee puts it
bluntly: ``I would not give Saddam Hussein any place in a
theological end time.''
   Such criticism does not bother a fundamentalist such as Taylor,
who interprets the Bible literally and believes the bodily ascent
of Christians into heaven before Armageddon can happen at any time.
   ``Wars usually happen in the Middle East in the October period -
before the snows come and after the hot weather,'' Taylor said.
``The Lord would really have to put it on hold the way things are
going.''
   thers are less certain that the decisive battle between the
forces of good and evil is at hand.
   ``Even some of the most intense prophecy preachers are reluctant
to say, `This is it','' said the Rev. Richard Buhler, host of a
national radio show for evangelicals called ``Table Talk.''
   Some factors work against the theories linking Saddam and
Armageddon.
   For one thing, skeptics can cite references to Babylon's being a
great power holding the riches of the world at the time of its
destruction. The Rev. Chuck Smith, a radio evangelist based in
Costa Mesa, Calif., says the Iraqis could fit that description
within two years if they gain control of enough oil.
   ``God is focusing the attention of the world on the Middle East
to alert us to the fact time is running out,'' said Smith, whose
program, ``The Word for Today,'' is heard on 150 radio stations.
   Meantime, what does one do?
   Taylor is urging his listeners to make a final effort to convert
friends and relatives to born-again Christianity, while others say
Christians should look beyond the initial period of suffering to
promises of another paradise beyond Armageddon.
   ``Rather than forebodings of doom, these things to us are just
the prelude to a glorious new day,'' said Smith. ``Personally, I
believe the Lord will ... create heaven on Earth.''

<TEXT>
   A 4,000-year-old temple believed to honor a
goddess of healing is being unearthed in Iraq and may shed light on
ancient medicine and other aspects of life in Babylonian times,
archeologists say.
   Digging began in January on the relatively untouched structure
in Nippur. Nippur was the religious heart of Mesopotamia and the
site of many temples, but archeologists said they were surprised by
the size of this temple.
   Diggers have only uncovered about a sixth of the temple's
foundation, estimated to be 100 yards long and 40 yards wide, and
already they have discovered baked clay figurines in the shapes of
humans and dogs.
   The temple, believed to honor the goddess Gula, may shed light
on Babylonian politics, economics, medicine and social structure,
said McGuire Gibson, archaeology professor at the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute.
   ``We really still don't understand a lot about Mesopotamian
culture,'' he said Wednesday.
   Mesopotamia, the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in
what is now Iraq and Syria, was the site of several ancient
civilizations beginning some 8,000 years ago.
   Much of what is known about those times comes from clay tablets,
the equivalent of modern-day letters. Remnants of other temples in
Nippur and elsewhere have been examined piecemeal and have often
been disturbed by diggers who have removed important artifacts,
archaeologists say.
   Findings from the dig could supplement information from clay
tablets and show ``not what people say they did, but what they
actually did,'' said Harvey Weiss, an archaeology professor at Yale
University who was not involved in the dig.
   Gibson and his colleagues hope to find new insights into
Babylonian medicine. ``One figurine shows a man clutching his
throat; another shows a man holding his stomach,'' he said.
``They're obviously showing Gula where it hurts.''
   The dog figurines may have been left to honor the goddess, since
dogs were associated with Gula, Gibson said.
   There was a highly developed system of health care during the
period in which the temple existed. Doctors prescribed herbs. When
the herbs didn't work, magicians performed exorcisms or other
spiritual intercession, but that information is based largely on
information from clay tablets, said William Biggs, a University of
Chicago professor who studies such tablets.
   The best possible discovery would be an archive of medical
texts, which might have been stored in the temple, Biggs said.
``That would be tremendously important because most of the medical
texts we have are from 800 years later,'' he said.
   Gibson said he first found a corner of the temple in 1973, but
shifting sands prevented excavation.
   Digging is at a lull during the hot summer months, but Gibson
said he will return to the site in January. Archaeologists from the
Oriental Institute have been digging in Nippur for 40 years under
an agreement with Iraq, Gibson said.

<TEXT>
   Experts are restoring the spectacular
centuries-old castle of Al-Ukhaidir, a crumbling architectural
masterpiece and Iraq's oldest Islamic monument, as part of an
ambitious program to revive the nation's ancient glories.
   The $120-million restoration program also calls for the
conservation of other small palaces in the western desert, not far
from the Shiite Moslem shrines at Karbala and Najaf 100 miles south
of Baghdad, the capital.
   The restorations will make Iraq's early Arab heritage more
accessible to visitors and provide a contrast with the renowned
ancient sites of Ur, Babylon, Nimrud and Nineveh in the north of the
country, the conservators say.
   President Saddam Hussein is striving to bolster Iraq's image by
promoting its ancient greatness and its history of civilization that
dates back at least 6,000 years.
   During the 8-year war against Iran in the Persian Gulf, Saddam
portrayed Iraq as an Arab bulwark against Persian aggression by
recalling Assyrian and Babylonian victories over the Persians in the
first millenium B.C.
   Al-Ukhaidir characterizes that ancient glory. With its 48 towers
and thick walled fortifications still rising 65 feet above the
desert, it looms as a striking landmark visible for miles.
   The British scholar Gertrude Bell, who visited Al-Ukhaidir in
1909, called it ``a solitary magnificence which rose out of the
desert.''
   Two years later she concluded that the architecture was ``the
logical outcome of the period of cultural transition'' when Arabs
switched from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle.
   Historians and archaeologists differ on how old the castle is,
but agree it was built by an Arab emir or caliph in the century
after the Islamic conquest of Iraq in the mid-7th century A.D.
   ``Whoever built it, the castle testifies that the first Islamic
builders assimilated neighboring civilization ... an assimilation
which later expressed itself in a high order of artistic impulse,''
said Abdul Aattar Al-Azawi, head of the restoration team.
   The complex was built of rough stones hauled from surrounding
areas, with mud brick used for interior walls. It was coated with
gypsum, a soft white plaster, for protection against rain and the
sandstorms that still howl in from the desert.
   The palace filled most of the interior of the complex, featuring
a huge banquet hall, guest suites, guardrooms, a mosque and baths,
as well as two large assembly areas. The stairways on the walls were
broad enough for defenders to ride horses up to the battlements.
   The restorers, aided by a small army of Sudanese and Egyptian
laborers, are using traditional materials for the reconstructions,
including trunks of date-palms to replace missing roofs. Villagers
in the region still use that method in roofing their mud brick
houses.
   Al-Azawi said the castle was the ``first important structural
monument'' built by the Arabs after they established themselves in
areas formerly ruled by the Sassanian and Byzantine empires.
   ``No doubt the interaction and even borrowing from these
civilizations are still evident, but the Arab contribution can
easily be detected,'' he said.
   Warriors from the Arabian peninsula set out in the 7th century to
conquer the Sassanian empire.
   They occupied Iraq, but it was another century before the
Abbasids broke free from the Syrian-led Umaiyad dynasty and

   There are no inscriptions or records by which archaeologists can
establish the date the castle was founded. Oddly for such a
monumental building complex, Al-Ukhaidir isn't mentioned by early
Islamic poets or historians.

castle stood at a crossroads of caravan routes across the desert,
linking trading centers in Iraq and Syria.

camped in the ruined palace.
   They were evicted in the 1930s when the first restorations were
made. But they still flock to the area for water from nearby springs
and wells and for pasture for their cattle.

   Experts are restoring the spectacular
centuries-old castle of Al-Ukhaidir, a crumbling architectural
masterpiece and Iraq's oldest Islamic monument, as part of an
ambitious program to revive the nation's ancient glories.
   The $120-million restoration program also calls for the
conservation of other small palaces in the western desert, not far
from the Shiite Moslem shrines at Karbala and Najaf 100 miles south
of Baghdad, the capital.
   The restorations will make Iraq's early Arab heritage more
accessible to visitors and provide a contrast with the renowned
ancient sites of Ur, Babylon, Nimrud and Nineveh in the north of the
country, the conservators say.
   President Saddam Hussein is striving to bolster Iraq's image by
promoting its ancient greatness and its history of civilization that
dates back at least 6,000 years.
   During the 8-year war against Iran in the Persian Gulf, Saddam
portrayed Iraq as an Arab bulwark against Persian aggression by
recalling Assyrian and Babylonian victories over the Persians in the
first millenium B.C.
   Al-Ukhaidir characterizes that ancient glory. With its 48 towers
and thick walled fortifications still rising 65 feet above the
desert, it looms as a striking landmark visible for miles.
   The British scholar Gertrude Bell, who visited Al-Ukhaidir in
1909, called it ``a solitary magnificence which rose out of the
desert.''
   Two years later she concluded that the architecture was ``the
logical outcome of the period of cultural transition'' when Arabs
switched from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle.
   Historians and archaeologists differ on how old the castle is,
but agree it was built by an Arab emir or caliph in the century
after the Islamic conquest of Iraq in the mid-7th century A.D.
   ``Whoever built it, the castle testifies that the first Islamic
builders assimilated neighboring civilization ... an assimilation
which later expressed itself in a high order of artistic impulse,''
said Abdul Aattar Al-Azawi, head of the restoration team.
   The complex was built of rough stones hauled from surrounding
areas, with mud brick used for interior walls. It was coated with
gypsum, a soft white plaster, for protection against rain and the
sandstorms that still howl in from the desert.
   The palace filled most of the interior of the complex, featuring
a huge banquet hall, guest suites, guardrooms, a mosque and baths,
as well as two large assembly areas. The stairways on the walls were
broad enough for defenders to ride horses up to the battlements.
   The restorers, aided by a small army of Sudanese and Egyptian
laborers, are using traditional materials for the reconstructions,
including trunks of date-palms to replace missing roofs. Villagers
in the region still use that method in roofing their mud brick
houses.
   Al-Azawi said the castle was the ``first important structural
monument'' built by the Arabs after they established themselves in
areas formerly ruled by the Sassanian and Byzantine empires.
   ``No doubt the interaction and even borrowing from these
civilizations are still evident, but the Arab contribution can
easily be detected,'' he said.
   Warriors from the Arabian peninsula set out in the 7th century to
conquer the Sassanian empire.
   They occupied Iraq, but it was another century before the
Abbasids broke free from the Syrian-led Umaiyad dynasty and
transformed Iraq into Islam's most prosperous region.
   There are no inscriptions or records by which archaeologists can
establish the date the castle was founded. Oddly for such a
monumental building complex, Al-Ukhaidir isn't mentioned by early
Islamic poets or historians.
   Azawi is also working to piece together evidence suggesting the
castle stood at a crossroads of caravan routes across the desert,
linking trading centers in Iraq and Syria.
   When Gertrude Bell visited the castle she found Bedouin nomads
camped in the ruined palace.
   They were evicted in the 1930s when the first restorations were
made. But they still flock to the area for water from nearby springs
and wells and for pasture for their cattle.

<TEXT>     Is the Persian Gulf war the ultimate voyage toward a fiery end before a
blissful beginning? Will there be, as the Bible says, a battle of Armageddon,
followed by the second coming of Christ?;    Since Iraq overran Kuwait last
summer, a fervor has been building among millions of evangelical Christians
nationwide. Many pastors are trying to address it directly, and mostly calmly,
with answers straight out of the Bible.;    But instead of declaring, as does
Revelation 16:17, "It is over," most televangelists, "end-time" scholars and
pastors are qualifying their sermons, saying the current conflict might be a
"foreshadowing," "prelude" or "preview" to the final conflagration -- but not
the main event.;    "A lot of us are aware, watching and alerted to what's
happening," said Greg Laurie, a radio evangelist in Southern California.;   
"After all, any time something happens in the Middle East where the security
of Israel is threatened, it could tip the first domino of the prophetic
calendar.";    Shortly after the war erupted last month, Laurie began
reviewing the Book of Revelation, the prophetic story that details the world's
last days, with his Monday night Bible study class at the Calvary Chapel in
Santa Ana.;    Laurie, like many others, does not go too far out on a limb.;  
 "I'm not the kind of person that makes statements that put me out there," he
said. "I'm not a prophet, and we have to be careful that we don't eat our
words in two months.";    America's 50 million evangelical Christians
interpret Bible stories as containing varying degrees of prophecy. Some see
these rich and vivid stories as highly metaphorical, to be read for their
moral value and sagacity.;    Yet there always have been those who combed the
engrossing plots, particularly in the books of Daniel, Revelation and Ezekiel,
for detailed scenarios of the prophetic panorama, scrutinizing them not only
for their lessons about good and evil but also for times, dates and locations
of upcoming events.;    Over time, some have even pinpointed the "end time,"
naming Hitler, Mussolini and even former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as
the Antichrist who would drive civilization over the brink. These days,
however, only a few venture to be that specific.;    Among those who interpret
the Bible literally, speculation has been focused on the words of the enemy
himself.;    Although Iraqi President Saddam Hussein takes his cues from
Islam, he has startled many Christians with his religious imagery -- such as
when he said after the first allied air strike on Baghdad that it would lead
to "the mother of all battles" or when he said he had rebuilt Iraq to the
glory of ancient Babylon and likened himself to Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian
king who destroyed Jerusalem in the sixth centry B.C.;    "The Bible does say
that Babylon will be revealed in last days," Laurie said. "Could this be
Babylon actually being rebuilt?";    The Rev. Ezra Williams, senior pastor of
the Bethel Assembly Gospel Church in Harlem, said his Sunday services have
been flooded with people who not only are questioning "the Bible relevancy" of
Operation Desert Storm but also by those who feel unable to cope with the
increasing economic turmoil.;    "I tell my people that we are living in a
crucial time in history when nations are positioning for the final battle of
Armageddon and they must do what they can for their brothers and sisters,"
Williams said. "But I don't say when it will happen. I just feel we must be
ready.";    The Rev. Chuck Smith, a popular Southern California radio
evangelist, said dire circumstances, such as the drought, gang shootings and
bank failures, have gripped people in Southern California and compounded their
fears about the apocalypse.;    "People are wondering what is happening to the
world," said Smith, whose sermons are carried by 150 radio stations. "The
turmoil in the Middle East seems to be a final catalyst that has turned people
to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, something is happening, and we'd better find some
foundation to deal with it.' From there, I do tell them to turn to the
prophesies.";    In a poll taken a week after the war started, the Gallup
organization asked 1,011 people in telephone interviews whether they thought
this battle would be Armageddon: 15 percent said yes; 74 percent answered no;
11 percent were unsure.;    Yet so many people are wondering that popular
books about biblical prophecy are outselling more secular treatises about the
troubled region. In the last 10 weeks, 600,000 copies of John F. Walvoord's
recently updated "Armageddon, Oil and the Middle East Crisis" have been sold;
300,000 more copies are being distributed by evangelist Billy Graham.;   
Walvoord is considered the leading scholar of this very dramatic school of
biblical prophecy and was for many years the head of the Dallas Theological
Seminary, long an academic center of literalist study. But neither the
80-year-old scholar nor others at Dallas are committing themselves about the
biblical significance of this war.;    Most conservative Christian leaders say
they do not care to be identified as doomsday visionaries.;    John Newport,
the former academic dean of Southwestern Baptist Seminary in Fort Worth,
Texas, pointed out that most conservative Christians do not use the Bible as a
blueprint to determine what will happen in the world.;    "The Book of
Revelation should not be interpreted as a precise timetable," Newport said.
"It gives broad principles and shows how history is moving toward a crescendo,
with an Antichrist appearing in every generation."  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of marine experts says the ``seven
underwater wonders of the world'' could be lost without a global
effort to protect the world's oceans and seas.
   ``We're killing the oceans,'' said former astronaut Scott
Carpenter, one of a panel of experts who named the sites Friday to
focus public attention on the world's underwater environment.
   Rick Sammon, president of the sponsoring organization, CEDAM
International, said the selection was the start of an educational
campaign aimed at preserving ``the world's beautiful but very
fragile marine environment.''
   ``If a concerted effort is not undertaken soon to protect and
preserve our underwater wonders, they _ like the classic Seven
Wonders of the World _ could be lost forever through carelessness,
negligence or deliberate mistreatment,'' he said.
   The seven underwater wonders, selected by the 14-member panel of
marine scientists, conservationists and explorers, are:
   Palau, an island group in Micronesia; the northern Red Sea; the
Great Barrier Reef of Australia; the waters of the Galapagos Islands
off the coast of Ecuador; Lake Baikal in Siberia; the Belize Barrier
Reef; and the deep ocean vents in the middle of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans.
   An honorable mention went to whales as one of the great living
wonders of the seas.
   CEDAM International is a non-profit group of 1,000 mostly marine
scientists and conservationists based at Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
   The educational campaign will include collecting data and
publishing information packets about the seven sites, a documentary
series, a touring exhibit of underwater photographs, school
curricula on marine conservation and an art-quality photo book.
   Carpenter, an environmental consultant from Vail, Colo., blamed
the world's runaway population for the declining health of the
oceans and marine life.
   ``We've got to stop population growth and we've got to eliminate
our ignorance,'' he said.
   ``The ocean is a very delicate entity and people don't realize
that. Without healthy oceans, a healthy planet is impossible.''
   The 13 other panelists included representatives of the
Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society, the United
Nations, the New York Aquarium, the New York Zoological Society,
Wildlife Conservation International, the University of Maryland, the
federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO,
Australia's largest scientific and industrial research organization.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: French bounty from Susa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 324 BC Susa was the scene of what must be the mega-marriage of all time,
when 80 of Alexander the Great's generals and 10,000 of his troops tied the
knot with a veritable army of Iranian debutantes. Churchgoers may also
remember Susa as the city of king Ahasuerus (Xerxes) and his seductive queen
Esther. But Susa's place among the grand metropolises of antiquity has
recently fared less well than its neighbour Babylon or even Persepolis,
Susa's twin capital of the Achaemenid empire brought down by Alexander.
The Royal City of Susa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York should
go some way to setting the record straight. A sampling of the finest works
of art from the 4,000 years before Alexander paints a rich and varied
picture of life and culture in ancient southwest Iran. From a child's model
of a hedgehog riding a cart to statues of royalty, lavish jewellery and
other paraphernalia of court and temple life this is an engagingly exotic
offering which deserves an audience beyond hardened antiquarians. It comes
to the US on loan from the Louvre, where the bounty from a century's
enthusiastic if not always scientific digging by French archaeologists is
housed.
No other collection outside Iran could mount such a show and the Louvre is
to be commended for taking the opportunity of a face-life to the galleries
of the antiquites orientales to allow this material its first sojourn
abroad. New York is the sole venue.
Susa the capital of the Achaemenid Persians was the successor to Susa the
sometime capital of Elam, Mesopotamia's powerful eastern neighbour and
frequent adversary in battle. Most of the exhibition is rightly devoted to
this less well known people whose place in the parade of civilisation is
rarely done justice in encyclopaedias and school set texts.
The Sumerians invented the first system of writing but who ran a close
second? Probably not the Egyptians, but the Elamites. Among the most
intriguing objects are the clay tablets from around 3000 BC inscribed in the
Proto-Elamite script, accompanied by impressions of cylinder seals which
acted as a signature when rolled on the damp clay. The Proto-Elamite code
still awaits its Champollion but is assumed to record an early form of
Elamite. This strange language, later written in scripts which can be read,
is unrelated to any other known tongue.
From the same period are two of the highlights of the exhibition, a pair of
small but exquisitely wrought silver figures of an antelope and a seated,
clothed bull holding a vase in its outstretched hoofs. ('Animal Farm'
studies of animals carrying on like humans were a Proto-Elamite penchant.)
No finer examples of the silversmiths' craft at this early date are known
from anywhere in the world.
A thousand years earlier Susian potters decorated their wares with inventive
and sophisticated animal studies of dogs, snakes, ibexes and birds which
have survived their 6,000 years of interment almost unscathed. This corpus
is rightly celebrated as one of the apogees of the ancient ceramicist's art
 -again there is nothing in Mesopotamia or elsewhere at the time to match
it.
Lying near the Mesopotamian border, Susa was often at loggerheads with the
Sumerians, Babylonians and Assyrians. But the Elamites sometimes gave as
good as they got and many of the most famous Mesopotamian monuments were in
fact not found in Iraq at all but at Susa, whither they were triumphantly
carted off by a 12th century BC Elamite king with a name that sounds like a
Cherokee battle-cry - Shutruk-Nahunte. These Susian spoils - the richest
cache of Mesopotamian loot ever found - include the famous law code of
Hammurabi (the only significant piece not in the show) and sculptures and
narrative reliefs set up by Naram-Sin and other Akkadian kings to celebrate
their great buildings and battles.
The Met has a tradition of producing splendid catalogues which skilfully
meld sound scholarship to coffee-table design and the Susa offering is no
exception.
The Royal City of Susa ends this Sunday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

 -- You've heard of the seven seas and the Seven Wonders of the World, so why 
not the seven underwater wonders of the world. A panel of 14 marine scientists, 
conservationists and explorers named the sites to draw attention to the 
underwater environment and to urge a global effort to protect it. Former 
astronaut Scott Carpenter, now an environmental consultant, said: "We're 
killing the oceans . . . . The ocean is a very delicate entity and people don't

 -- A Miami couple who survived 66 days in a life raft in the Pacific returned 
home, each more than 50 pounds lighter. "We're going to rest -- and go away 
from the ocean for a while, to the mountains, the prairies," William Butler, 
59, said. Butler and his wife, Simone Butler, 56, said their boat was sunk by 
whales and they fended off sharks and subsisted on fish they caught and 
desalinated seawater. The couple was rescued by the Costa Rican Coast Guard. 
Waiting for them at the airport with other relatives and friends was Jessica

 -- Japanese Emperer Akihito's second son, Prince Aya, 23, has received 
permission to marry Kiko Kawashima, 22, a graduate student he has been seeing 
for four years. Palace and government officials made no official announcement 
but nearly all large newspapers and television networks carried the news about 
the prince who is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. Kawashima, who 
met the prince at Tokyo's Gakushuin University, sparked speculation about an 
engagement announcement when she visited the Akasaka Palace with her parents. 
The engagement must be approved by the Imperial Council, led by Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu. DAVE JOHNSON

   In the middle of this sun-baked
Anatolian plateau in western Turkey, U.S. archaeologists are
working to preserve the tomb of King Midas, around whom grew the
myth of the golden touch.
   Archaeologists believe the 2,600-year-old tomb is the oldest
standing wooden structure in the world.
   About 90 pyramid-shaped mounds of earth rise on the land where
the Phrygians had their ancient capital of Gordion.
   The largest and highest of the burial mounds is believed to be
the tomb of King Midas, believed to have lived from 725 B.C. to 675
B.C.
   The tomb chamber, within a mound about 150 feet high and 900
feet in diameter, has started to show signs of deterioration,
mostly because of lack of air circulation and the high rate of
humidity inside the grave.
   ``There are cracks in the north wall and the wall is slightly
bulging out,'' explained Professor Kenneth Sams of the University
of North Carolina, who has undertaken the preservation work in the
name of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.
   ``There is no imminent danger of collapse but we want to keep
this unique monument as it is for the coming generations,'' he said.
   The tomb was excavated in 1957 under the direction of the late
Rodney S. Young of the University of Pennsylvania.
   According to historians, it was the Phrygians who first
introduced the tumulus, or mound, burial style in Anatolia. This
small central Anatolian village is 60 miles southwest of the
Turkish capital city of Ankara.
   Thirty grave chambers have been excavated, 25 by the U.S.
excavators over the past few decades and the rest by the Germans in
1900.
   The Midas chamber was made of squared logs and an outer casing
of round logs of juniper and pine to take the pressure of the
rubble from a wall covering the tomb. Phyrgians built a roof and a
waterproof stone covering on top of the tomb and then covered it
with tons of earth.
   The body and funeral gifts were placed inside the rectangular
chamber, which measures about 320 square feet.
   Large white fungi today cover the upper sections of the wooden
chamber.
   ``They are slowly eating the wood,'' says Sams. ``We have to
bring mycologists (fungi specialists) here to determine how many
kinds of fungi exist here and why they find this place so
comfortable.''
   Sams said the archaeologists are in the preliminary stage of the
conservation work. First, they are trying to find the reason for
the fluctuations in the humidity, which ranges from a low of 35
percent to a high of 85 percent, while temperatures remain steady
throughout the year at about 60 degrees.
   The Phrygians moved into Anatolia from Thrace and the Balkan
peninsula in 10th century B.C. and became the major power in Asia
Minor in the 9th century B.C., inheriting the remains of the
Hittite civilization. They served as a cultural bridge from the
Hittites to the Anatolian civilizations of the Lydians and the
Greeks.
   They bequeathed to Greek mythology and Roman religion their
mother-goddess Cybele.
   Professor Ekrem Akurgal, one of Turkey's most prominent
archaeologists, said many Phyrgian kings were named Midas, but the
one whose tomb is being preserved is the great monarch who
established Phrygian hegemony in Asia Minor and is mentioned in
Assyrian tablets of the period.
   Akurgal said this Midas is the one on whom the legend of the
golden touch is based.
   According to the legend, Midas, son of King Gordius, was a
spendthrift who begged the gods for the power to turn anything he
touched to gold. His wish was granted but Midas nearly starved
because even the food he tried to eat turned to gold.
   The curse was lifted when he cleansed himself by bathing in the
river Pactolus, known today as Sart Cayi, famous for its golden
sands.
   The burial mounds are on a site on which, according to Greek
legend, Gordius tied his cart to a pole with an intricate knot _
the Gordian knot. Oracles said that whoever untied the knot would
rule Asia. Alexander the Great cut the knot with a stroke of his
sword, according to the story.
   Archaeologists today are particularly interested in the woodwork
of the Phrygians.
   In the Midas burial chamber, excavators found remains of tables,
inlaid wooden screens, bronze and leather belts, bronze cauldrons
and other items lying beside the skeleton of the king.
   A team of U.S. art conservators and archaeologists led by
Elizabeth Simpson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York are
restoring these artifacts.
   ``This extraordinary furniture from Gordion occupies a special
place in the history of woodworking and of ancient art in
general,'' she said. ``The inlay work is ingenious, the geometric
decoration bold and elegant.''
   The Phrygians used wood of contrasting colors and displayed a
unique sense of design in symmetry and patterns, she said. The
findings from the tombs are also important because very little
ancient wooden furniture has survived.
   The team members have so far restored two inlaid screens and a
wooden table that are on display in Ankara's Anatolian
Civilizations Museum.
   Their restoration work, sponsored by the U.S. Kress Foundation
of New York City continues at the laboratory of the Ankara museum.

Anatolian plateau in western Turkey, U.S. archaeologists are
working to preserve the tomb of King Midas, around whom grew the
myth of the golden touch.
   Archaeologists believe the 2,600-year-old tomb is the oldest
standing wooden structure in the world.
   About 90 pyramid-shaped mounds of earth rise on the land where
the Phrygians had their ancient capital of Gordion.
   The largest and highest of the burial mounds is believed to be
the tomb of King Midas, believed to have lived from 725 B.C. to 675
B.C.
   The tomb chamber, within a mound about 150 feet high and 900
feet in diameter, has started to show signs of deterioration,
mostly because of lack of air circulation and the high rate of
humidity inside the grave.
   ``There are cracks in the north wall and the wall is slightly
bulging out,'' explained Professor Kenneth Sams of the University
of North Carolina, who has undertaken the preservation work in the
name of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.
   ``There is no imminent danger of collapse but we want to keep
this unique monument as it is for the coming generations,'' he said.
   The tomb was excavated in 1957 under the direction of the late
Rodney S. Young of the University of Pennsylvania.
   According to historians, it was the Phrygians who first
introduced the tumulus, or mound, burial style in Anatolia. This
small central Anatolian village is 60 miles southwest of the
Turkish capital city of Ankara.
   Thirty grave chambers have been excavated, 25 by the U.S.
excavators over the past few decades and the rest by the Germans in
1900.
   The Midas chamber was made of squared logs and an outer casing
of round logs of juniper and pine to take the pressure of the
rubble from a wall covering the tomb. Phyrgians built a roof and a
waterproof stone covering on top of the tomb and then covered it
with tons of earth.
   The body and funeral gifts were placed inside the rectangular
chamber, which measures about 320 square feet.
   Large white fungi today cover the upper sections of the wooden
chamber.
   ``They are slowly eating the wood,'' says Sams. ``We have to
bring mycologists (fungi specialists) here to determine how many
kinds of fungi exist here and why they find this place so
comfortable.''
   Sams said the archaeologists are in the preliminary stage of the
conservation work. First, they are trying to find the reason for
the fluctuations in the humidity, which ranges from a low of 35
percent to a high of 85 percent, while temperatures remain steady
throughout the year at about 60 degrees.
   The Phrygians moved into Anatolia from Thrace and the Balkan
peninsula in 10th century B.C. and became the major power in Asia
Minor in the 9th century B.C., inheriting the remains of the
Hittite civilization. They served as a cultural bridge from the
Hittites to the Anatolian civilizations of the Lydians and the
Greeks.
   They bequeathed to Greek mythology and Roman religion their
mother-goddess Cybele.
   Professor Ekrem Akurgal, one of Turkey's most prominent
archaeologists, said many Phyrgian kings were named Midas, but the
one whose tomb is being preserved is the great monarch who
established Phrygian hegemony in Asia Minor and is mentioned in
Assyrian tablets of the period.
   Akurgal said this Midas is the one on whom the legend of the
golden touch is based.
   According to the legend, Midas, son of King Gordius, was a
spendthrift who begged the gods for the power to turn anything he
touched to gold. His wish was granted but Midas nearly starved
because even the food he tried to eat turned to gold.
   The curse was lifted when he cleansed himself by bathing in the
river Pactolus, known today as Sart Cayi, famous for its golden
sands.
   The burial mounds are on a site on which, according to Greek
legend, Gordius tied his cart to a pole with an intricate knot _
the Gordian knot. Oracles said that whoever untied the knot would
rule Asia. Alexander the Great cut the knot with a stroke of his
sword, according to the story.
   Archaeologists today are particularly interested in the woodwork
of the Phrygians.
   In the Midas burial chamber, excavators found remains of tables,
inlaid wooden screens, bronze and leather belts, bronze cauldrons
and other items lying beside the skeleton of the king.
   A team of U.S. art conservators and archaeologists led by
Elizabeth Simpson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York are
restoring these artifacts.
   ``This extraordinary furniture from Gordion occupies a special
place in the history of woodworking and of ancient art in
general,'' she said. ``The inlay work is ingenious, the geometric
decoration bold and elegant.''
   The Phrygians used wood of contrasting colors and displayed a
unique sense of design in symmetry and patterns, she said. The
findings from the tombs are alsoimportant because very little
ancient wooden furniture has survived.
   The team members have so far restored two inlaid screens and a
wooden table that are on display in Ankara's Anatolian
Civilizations Museum.
   Their restoration work, sponsored by the U.S. Kress Foundation
of New York City continues at the laboratory of the Ankara museum.

Norman Najimy, principal of the only school in Richmond, Mass., taught School 
Committee members a hard lesson in altruism. In tears, they fired him for it, 
just as he had asked. The financially strapped Consolidated Elementary School 
earlier had been forced to cut another $50,000 from the budget, and Najimy 
said: "My choice was easy. Cut two teachers or can one principal." Supt. George 
St. Pierre said the selfless action will save the district more than $40,000 
and help preserve computer, lunch and basic skills programs. Najimy will stay 
for the summer to help train a teacher-principal, who will get an extra $3,000 
per year for limited supervisory duties. "This was the shortest and saddest 
meeting in our history," committee member Donna Slowick said after the 
20-minute session in which Najimy was dismissed. St. Pierre said: "Most of the 
committee was in tears, including the chairman of the board."

 -- The Iraqi government is offering a $1.6-million first prize in an effort to 
learn how water reached the high terraces of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, 
one of the ancient world's seven wonders. INA, the Iraqi news agency, said 
engineers are being asked to develop a way to water the gardens built by King 
Nebuchadnezzar without modern pumps, to keep them authentic when they are 
renovated.

 -- Vice President Dan Quayle told the Young Republicans National Convention in 
Nashville that the anniversary was near for "Neil Armstrong and Buzz Lukens' 
walk on the moon." Astronauts Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the first steps on 
the moon on July 20, 1969. Republican U.S. Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens, 
however, was recently sentenced to 30 days in jail after being convicted of 
having sex with a 16-year-old girl. Quayle also called for the GOP to reach out 
to blacks and other minorities. He arrived on stage after "Dixie" blared from 
the loudspeakers as noisy delegates displayed a few Confederate flags. Young 
Republican Chairman Rich Jacobs later defended the song and the flags as shows 
of regional pride. But Thomas L. Hayes, one of about 40 black delegates, said 
he was offended and blamed fringe elements of the party. "These are intelligent 
people, and they know what the Confederate flag represents," Hayes said. DAVE

   British brewers and archaelogists wanting to know
how ancient Egypt made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a
brewery, read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the
liquid in ancient pottery.
   News of the three-year project, launched by a leading British
brewery and the nation's prestigious Egypt Exploration Society,
drew headlines in London newspapers on Friday.
   ``Brewers seek the Pharaohs' secret,'' said one. ``Explorers
seek the recipe for Tutankhamen's beer,'' boasted another.
   The Independent called it one of the first large-scale research
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a
commercial British company.
   When the researchers have figured out what went into brewing
beer in ancient Egypt, the brewery will try to reproduce it at its
laboratory in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.
   But Jim Merrington, corporate affairs director for Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries PLC, said he wasn't sure if the fine ale of the
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in British pubs.
   ``It is highly improbable it will appear on the bar, but it is
not beyond the realms of possibility,'' he told a news conference
Thursday in Edinburgh.
   He said the project will be based largely on archaeological
excavations at Tell-el Amarna, one of Egypt's ancient capitals
located 190 miles south of Cairo.
   Archaeologists from the society, led by field director Barry
Kemp of Cambridge University, are investigating a royal brewery
there attached to a temple built by Queen Nefertiti.
   She was the leading wife of King Tutankhamen's father, the
Pharaoh Akhnaton, whose name also was spelled Akhenaten or Ikhnaton.
   Tutankhamen reigned from 1333 to 1323 B.C. His tomb was
discovered in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in 1922. His solid
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the
imagination of the world.
   Merrington said Nefertiti's temple, each side of which measures
750 feet, had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread
for religious festivals. Both processes employ yeast.
   But no one knows what the beer tasted like.
   Ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several
different beers, ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a
finer texture.
   Wall paintings from Tutankhamen's day depict courtiers vomiting
after getting drunk on beer. Another wall painting shows Nefertiti
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel.
   Merrington said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of
the beer. If they're successful, he said, scientists working for
Scottish and Newcastle would use a chemical process to test those
samples to try to determine the ancient brew's taste and
consistency.
   ``Apart from what the archaeologists give us, we hope to examine
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in Europe,
America and Egypt,'' Merrington said. ``We will use 20th century
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe.
Then we will try to brew it.''
   Researchers on the project also will examine ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics, tomb models and written material for clues to making
the beer.
   ``The pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer, with
bakeries and breweries operating together,'' Kemp said. ``The
ancient Egyptians baked a kind of bread first, then used it as a
mash from which to brew the beer.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqis hardened by eight years of war with
Iran seem almost casual about the formidable buildup of U.S.
firepower across the border in Saudi Arabia.
   There is some concern about the embargo on trade with Iraq
ordered by the United Nations after Baghdad seized Kuwait, and some
suspicions about the causes of the crisis.
   But there is no smell of war along the noisy, bustling avenues
of this ancient capital.
   Instead, Iraqis willing to talk with Western reporters view the
threat of war with a mixture of bravado and Arab fatalism.
   ``What can I do about it?'' shrugged Mahdi Kathom, a 30-year-old
vegetable vendor in central Baghdad. ``If it happens, it is because
God lets it happen. There is nothing to do about it.''
   ``God willing, our president will solve this,'' said one
middle-aged woman who declined to give her name. ``Saddam Hussein
is a strong and wise man.''
   Many Iraqis question the motives of President Bush in sending
troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia. But a few, speaking privately
in this rigidly controlled society, say they are suspicious about
their own leader and his reasons for provoking the crisis.
   Some say Saddam underestimated the U.S. reaction and a few
others voice suspicions that he triggered the crisis partly to
challenge the Americans and raise his standing in the Arab world.
   For eight years, Saddam told his people they were fighting Iran
for control over the Shatt al-Arab waterway that spills into the
northern Persian Gulf.
   Then, on Aug. 12, just 10 days after the invasion of Kuwait,
Saddam acknowledged Iran's claim to shared sovereignty over the
waterway that some Iraqis believe they bought with the blood of
their loved ones.
   Saddam's peace overture secured his vulnerable eastern border,
freeing troops to confront the U.S. buildup.
   Some Iraqis say they now wonder why Saddam gave in on the
waterway and why he chose to invade Kuwait.
   But while a few quietly mumble their suspicions, Iraqis who
spoke openly defended the invasion and occupation of the country
they have long considered a part of Iraq, wrongfully separated from
the motherland by British colonial rulers.
   ``Forget Kuwait, it is a dream. There is no Kuwait,'' said one
Baghdad taxi driver.
   A few Iraqis said they have heard frightening assessments of
American military might on foreign radio broadcasts by the British
Broadcasting Corp. and Voice of America.
   But the state-controlled press has focused on dissent in the
West against the sanctions and the troop buildup. The Iraqi press
also has disparaged the ability of U.S. troops to fight against
battle-hardened Iraqis in the desert.
   Near the center of Baghdad stands the Monument of Saddam's
Qaddissiya Martyrs, a tribute to the dead of the Iran-Iraq war,
named after Babylon's victory over the Persians in 600 B.C.
   The marble monument covered with aqua tiles is in the form of
two halves of an Islamic dome. It is split to symbolize the Islamic
tradition that the dome of the mosque opens to allow martyrs to
ascend to heaven.
   It is one of the many military monuments in Baghdad. Another is
made from the wreckage of an Iranian war plane shot down over the
city.
   Madria Nasser Abdul Al-Mishadani, a 40-year-old woman walking
near the Qaddissiya monument, said Iraqi women are not afraid their
loved ones will be killed in another war.
   ``The women are not afraid. Aren't we Iraqis? Why should we be
scared?'' she asked.
   ``Why is the United States so upset over the invasion of
Kuwait?''
   ``The United States had less right to go into Panama than we had
to go into Kuwait,'' she added. ``We have tried to get Kuwait back
for 30 years.''
   A man walking near the monument, 40-year-old Salem Kalaf, said
that during the war with Iran people got used to hardships such as
the reduced consumption that the U.N. trade embargo might bring
again.
   ``We know about war. We saw missiles hit our homes and our
stores. And we lived through that,'' he said.
   The government indicated it will start rationing the sale of
some basic foods in the next few days. But it insisted the measure
was a precaution because of the sanctions and not a response to
shortages.
   Some lines have already formed outside bakeries for bread. But
while some say privately they are worried about shortages, most
Iraqis like Kalaf say publicly they are prepared to endure more
hardships.
   ``I am not afraid. Our country is strong and we can handle
this,'' said Mohammed Hussein, a 47-year-old Baghdad resident, who
said two of his sons were with the army in Kuwait.
   ``I want to tell the American people that their president is not
listening to us. We want peace,'' said Ahmed Abdallah, a
54-year-old Baghdad resident.
   ``It appears that most people do not want a war with Iraq. If
America is a democratic country, then Bush should listen to what
the people are saying.''

   Two firefighters were killed Thursday
while battling a blaze in a pine forest near the site of ancient
Olympia, police said.
   ``They were ahead of everybody else with a hose when the fire
outflanked them and just swallowed them up,'' an officer said in a
telephone interview from the nearby town of Pirgos, 195 miles west
of Athens.
   Forestry officials were unable to estimate the damage to the
forest of Palaiovarvassaina because the fire was still raging and
was fanned by strong wind, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Olympia, a sanctuary that was the site of the ancient Olympic
Games founded in the eighth century B.C., is located in lush pine
forests in the western Peloponnesos peninsula.
   Excavations have revealed part of the temple of Zeus, one of the
seven wonders of the ancient world.

   Tomorrow, for most Christians, becomes Jan. 1,
1900, the end of a decade. Ten years hence marks the end of the
millennium. But hold on a second. Says who? One man's millennium is
another man's humdrum day. The way years get numbered, you see,
depends on who's counting, when they began counting and what
they're counting.

   Repent, brothers and sisters, repent! The millennium is coming.
   Kind of.
   Kind of because this small planet does not, most decidedly, spin
to the same calendar. Worldwide there are at least 40 of them, each
marching to its own drummer.
   But just 10 years from New Year's Day, Christians will rip a
page off the calendar and Saturday 12-31-1999 will become Sunday
1-1-2000, the zeros lined up like cherries in a slot machine, like
a milestone 100,000 miles on the family clunker. (Killjoys say the
millennium really is 1-1-2001 because we count from one, not zero,
so 2000 is really the 10th year of the 1990s. Disregard them).
   But one man's millennium is another's numberless day at the
office. Moslems will uncelebrate the middle of 1420 A.H., Jews 5761
A.M. Ancient Greeks will observe the 694th Olympiad.
   Olympiad?
   The way years get numbered, you see, depends on who's counting,
when they began counting and WHAT they're counting. If you count by
the moon _ Moslems do _ a year is 12 lunar months based on 29 days,
12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.8 seconds from new moon to new moon. The
solar year is about 11 days longer, the 365 days, 5 hours, 48
minutes and 46 seconds it takes Earth to circle the sun. Eventually
by the Moslem calendar it's June in January. But who decided it's
January in January anyway?
   To begin with, the calendar is a convenience to mark the passage
of time. It tells you when it's time to move the sheep into the
hills, when to report for spring training, when to plant cotton,
when to pay bills, when to get married next Saturday and celebrate
the anniversary of such 10 years hence.
   Ancients just chased mastodons whenever they could find them and
didn't worry about dates until they settled down and began planting
crops. For that you had to know seasons. The clock of the heavenly
bodies in their unalterable cycles told them.
   The Egyptians knew the Nile was about to flood when Sirius, the
Dog Star, was on the horizon at sunrise. Plant. Australian
aborigines know it's time to hunt termites when Arcturus is on the
horizon at dawn. Eat.
   The Sumerians and Babylonians, first-rate farmers and no
dummies, had a good calendar. But it was based on the moon and
pretty soon you're planting wheat in December with predictable
results.
   ``The year hath a deficiency,'' would declare Hammurabi, the
great lawgiver, as he threw in an extra month. We call such
doctoring intercalation.
   The Babylonians also invented the week, maybe because seven was
their lucky number, maybe because it conveniently divided the
lunation into quarters. The Jews later reinvented the week based on
the seven days of Creation.
   Somewhere along the line Sunday became the first day because the
sun gave life. Saturday, at week's end, comes from the Roman god
Saturn who presided over old age. Old-time Teutons also named days
for gods such as Wodan, Thor and Fria. Guess what became of them.
   In Yemen the day begins when you can tell a white goat hair from
a black one. Moslems begin a month when holy men first report a
sighting of the new crescent moon. If it's overcast, they wait a
day and start counting again.
   ``The Mursi in southwest Ethiopia spend most of the month
arguing about what day it is. They spend the rest arguing about
what month it is,'' says LeRoy Doggett, editor of the Nautical
Almanac in Washington, D.C.
   ``If you don't have to catch a plane, the date may not really
matter.''
   The Soviets, in the flush of communist creation, tried a
five-day week in 1919, went to six days in 1932 and returned to
tradition in 1941. They also celebrate the October Revolution in
November, which we'll get to.
   The ancient Egyptians switched from the Babylonian moon to a
12-month solar calendar of 30 days each and tagged on five holidays
at year's end. In 238 B.C., Ptolemy III, also no dummy, put in a
leap day after checking with Sirius to make up for the fraction of
a day left over from 365 days in orbit.
   Meanwhile, in Rome, the Romans did as the Romans. Romulus,
co-founder of the city, devised a 10-month calendar of 304 days.
Winter months were ``useless'' and not counted. The year began in
Aprilis, from Latin ``to open,'' at the time of the equinox of
equal night and day.
   Romulus's successor, King Numa, added Januarius and Februarius
and came up with a 12-month calendar of 365 days. Not bad, but
still out of tune, made more so by high priests who were not above
subtracting a month to collect taxes sooner or adding some to
extend friends' terms of office.
   What with one thing or another, by the time of Julius Caesar the
calendar was three months out of phase with the sun. Caesar hired
the Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes. He added three months, just like
that, to 46 B.C. producing a year of 445 days and what justly
became known as ``the year of confusion.''
   This Julian calendar had the requisite 365 days, plus a leap
every third year. Caesar's birth month of Quintilis was renamed in
his honor. Guess where July comes from. Augustus Caesar fine-tuned
things by making leap year every fourth year. In HIS honor the
month of Sextilils was named for him _ by now you must know where
August comes from _ and a day was added to it to make 31 and not be
outshone by 31-day Julius. The Julian calendar was OK but lagged 14
seconds a year or one day every 128 years.
   But which year was it?
   The Romans started counting from Romulus and Remus, year one
being 753 A.U.C. _ anno urbis conditae, the year the city was
founded. The Jews toted up the begats and counted from Creation,
3761 B.C., before Christ to Christians, A.M. _ anno mundi, year of
the world _ to Jews. The Greeks counted in four-year periods _
Olympiads _ starting with 776 B.C. when Coraebus won the first
Olympic foot race. The Japanese counted from the first emperor _
660 B.C. _ and the Chinese from the first year of whatever dynasty
they were in. The Mohammadans weren't there yet.

<P>
Saddam Hussein's brutal thrust into Kuwait has been etched in black throughout 
the world, but there is no certain sign showing how it plays on the streets of 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-war protests, or even murmurs, are unknown in the capital, whatever might 
be on the Iraqis' minds. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's is a silent society, cowed by knock-in-the-night internal security. 
But in troubled times it can also be strongly nationalistic, streaked with 
pride over the country's hard-fought war that drove an Iranian enemy into 
submission in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
What do ordinary Iraqis want? How do they see themselves in the world? 
</P>
<P>
For visitors to Iraq, the answers are difficult to plumb, because most Iraqis 
have been conditioned to display exaggerated caution around outside influences 
-- a sort of safe-side xenophobia. Alert to the watchful eyes and keen ears of 
security agents and their informers, very few will speak with foreigners 
outside the demands of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Iraqis may now be wondering what they are doing occupying Kuwait, the 
country that helped them most in their war against Iran -- but if so, they are 
not wondering out loud," one Western diplomat who was based in the Persian Gulf 
region for years said in an interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat who was stationed in Baghdad throughout the Iran-Iraq War 
agreed. "You could never get close to ordinary Iraqis," he said. "The only ones 
we could talk to without putting them in jeopardy were our drivers, cooks and 
maids -- and they were all government agents."

But some signs emerge, often contradictory. For instance, educated and informed 
Iraqis often expressed disgust over the high-handed antics of Kuwaiti men who 
trekked north to Basra and Baghdad for whiskey-filled weekends, banned in their 
own country. For tradition-minded rural Iraqis, such behavior was even more 
shocking. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as Hussein opened the doors to small private business over the 
past two years, Iraqi merchants knew what their countrymen wanted: all the 
luxury items that filled the shops of the neighboring Persian Gulf sheikdoms. 
</P>
<P>
Along the broad streets of Baghdad, entrepreneurs stocked shelves with the 
latest household conveniences, import cosmetics and other symbols of the 
Western world. The Iraqis cannot afford the prices, and many good-life 
boutiques have gone sour, but customers still press against the windows for a 
covetous look. 
</P>
<P>
There is perhaps no sharper example of Iraqi desires than the long lines at 
embassy visa offices. After nearly a decade of banning foreign travel, Hussein 
-- who has not visited a Western capital in more than a decade -- relaxed the 
restrictions last February. Tens of thousands have jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't you?" a retired chemist told a visitor soon after the ban was lifted. 
"I want to go to the States." 
</P>
<P>
One benefit of Hussein's regime, which he describes as Arab socialist, has been 
a sharp jump in literacy in Iraq, making it one of the best-read nations in the 
Arab world. In art, architecture and literature, the country of 17 million 
produces at a worldly level. Galleries display abstract and Arabic-evocative 
paintings that have won critical praise in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, because they have been repeatedly drawn in by wars throughout 
their history, "they really do take pride in seeing themselves as the hard men 
of the Arab world," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
But the long years of Hussein's jingoism -- he has formally been in power since 
1979 -- his insistence that Iraqi culture is superior and his glorification of 
the ancient Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations have a dark side as well. 
</P>
<P>
One shameful example is the Iraqi treatment of the millions of foreign workers 
who have kept the economy running both during and after the war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Asian workers -- Filipinos, Thais and Pakistanis -- are treated shabbily in 
many Arab countries. The Iraqis have extended the behavior to their Arab 
brethren, Egyptians and Sudanese, as well. In a common scene at Baghdad's 
International Airport, hundreds of Egyptian laborers are forced to sit in the 
hallways while other travelers take chairs in half-empty lounges. 
</P>
<P>
And Hussein's regime can be equally brutal to its own people. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the gulf war, when things were going badly for Iraq and the strain was 
beginning to show on the populace, Hussein came up with a way to lower what was 
said to be a high rate of desertion from the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
Any deserter who was caught -- and that was most of them -- was taken to his 
home and executed in front of his family, which was then made to pay for the 
bullets used to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
One French diplomat, leaving Baghdad after several years there, had this to 
say: "This is a very heavy place. The things that are natural in most places 
are unnatural here. To take a picture, to go outside the city, to be irreverent 
-- all these are forbidden. When you see someone smile, you think you have made 
a big discovery." 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that unites (Iraqis) is fear -- fear of their government," 
Augustus Richard Norton, a Middle East expert at the U.S. Military Academy in 
West Point, N.Y., declared. 
</P>
<P>
But even the Iraqi leader cannot get it all his way, and in times of economic 
stress -- like these -- the government line is to blame the outside world. 
Iraq's crushing foreign debt, for instance, is portrayed in the controlled 
press as an alien imposition, a view credited in part for the invasion of 
Kuwait, which rejected an Iraqi demand for erasure of its war debts. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally hairline fissures appear on the surface of the ordinary 
Iraqis' hard shell. A few years ago, when the war with Iran was going badly for 
Iraq and casualties were high, an American visitor in Baghdad was surprised by 
the number of young men who nervously approached him to ask for help in 
obtaining a U.S. visa. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1986, the year of the "black flags" -- a symbol of mourning -- and there 
were so many war dead that virtually every residential street in the Iraqi 
capital was aflutter with them. Alarmed at the effect this sight was having on 
morale, the government banned the display of these homemade flags. 
</P>
<P>
But as the death toll mounted and food shortages worsened, the flags reappeared 
in spite of the ban -- a small but, in the Iraqi context, exceedingly brave 
display of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
These small gestures of dissent did not last long, however: The tide of battle 
began to change, for one thing, in part because of Iraq's then-widespread use 
of poison gas. But 1986 also was the year that Iraq passed a law making 
criticism of the government punishable by sentences ranging from seven years' 
imprisonment to death. 
</P>
<P>
The grim joke at the time was that, if you got sentenced to seven years, you 
might get lucky and have the punishment commuted to death. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the president's ego flows over his country in nightly newscasts: Hussein 
hosts Arab leaders, talks tough to the West, tours country villages surrounded 
by adoring children and a uniformed, black-bereted bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
What do the Iraqis think of it? How do they see their place in the world? No 
polls will be taken to tell. He is not appealing for support of himself or his 
policy. Hussein lays down the law, and his countrymen keep their counsel. 
</P>

   Americans marveled at the towering statue of
Ramses II in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaoh's
reign, but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of
someone else.
   New research indicates the statue was of a lesser-known pharaoh
who ruled 600 years before Ramses the Great was born. Experts say
it became Ramses because he had his artisans retouch the face and
inscribe his name.
   They also say the ancients would have been worshipping both
god-kings when they made offerings to the 24-foot statue of red
granite, which weighs 47 tons.
   No one doubted the statue was of Ramses when, in 1987, it was
pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in Memphis, the ancient
Egyptian capital.
   So positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff
from the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. A band played the
national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20-minute farewell salute.
   With American help, the statue was restored at Memphis State
University in Tennessee. Then it joined other Ramses artifacts
already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide
tour of U.S. museums.
   First at Memphis, then in Denver, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., and
Dallas, the colossus stole the show.
   But it isn't Ramses, says art historian Hourig Sourouzian, who
has spent years studying Ramses statues.
   ``It's Sesostris I,'' she said. ``Ramses touched it up, made it
more his style and put his name on it.
   ``Of course, when Ramses did this, the statue became Ramses. No
problem. But when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus,
they were remembering not only Ramses, but Sesostris.''
   Sesostris I also was called ``the Great'' and died in 1926 B.C.
He was a pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom, while Ramses was of the New
Kingdom, ruling for 67 years in the 13th century B.C.
   Ms. Sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large
Egyptian statues is that ``Ramses had so many of them, and his name
was so famous, that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to
have been his.''
   Nevertheless, she said, ``something disturbed me even then''
when she first saw the colossus in the mud of Egypt.
   ``The next time I saw it was on exhibit'' in Memphis, Tenn., she
said. ``It was beautifully restored, beautifully lighted, but when
I took a deep look, I said, `It's not Ramses.'''
   Rita Freed, who led the restoration team for the Institute of
Egyptian Art and Archaeology at Memphis State, said she first heard
of the Sourouzian research a year ago.
   ``It's excellent. I think she's right,'' Ms. Freed said by
telephone from the Boston Museum, where she now works.
   ``I didn't think anything about it until we brought the statue
to Tennessee,'' she said. ``Once we had it standing, I said, `Gee,
that looks Middle Kingdom,' but I must emphasize it's Ramses. His
name is on it and we've done a wonderful job of saving a
magnificent statue.''
   It is no secret that Ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues
of himself. He erected them throughout Egypt.
   Some depict him standing, some sitting. The largest, estimated
to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1,000 tons, lies headless in his
ruined mortuary temple, the Ramesseum.
   Perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at Abu
Simbel, southern Egypt.
   Ms. Sourouzian said she discovered Ramses the Great borrowed
colossal statues in his customary grand style. She reported finding
nine Sesostris I retreads.
   Both pharaohs had connections with Memphis, now Mit Rahina
village, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis contained several
colossi, including one of Ramses now in Cairo's Ramses Square.
   Another of him remains at Mit Rahina, on display where it fell.
A twin of the colossus that toured America, also a made-over
Sesostris, is in pieces at the Mit Rahina outdoor museum, Ms.
Sourouzian said.
   Discovering what is or is not the Ramses look hasn't been easy
for the Armenian-born scholr, who is a doctoral candidate at the
Sorbonne in Paris and co-author of the official catalogue of
Cairo's Egyptian Museum.
   Relics of Ramses and his family are everywhere in Egypt. He had
at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to
have fathered 167 children.
   About 300 statues of Ramses have survived, and Ms. Sourouzian
has used her artist's eye to examine them: clothing, expression,
muscles, size of the legs, items in each hand, the crown.
   Statues of Sesostris' era had one look, those of Ramses' another.
   ``In earlier times, statues showed fierceness because the
pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies,'' Ms.
Sourouzian said. ``Ramses, who truly was great, could have
portrayed himself on statues this way, but he preferred a faint
smile, a gentleness.
   ``A Ramses statue has a sweet expression. He has massive legs
and wears a longer kilt. He has a triangular or round face with
almost almond-shaped eyes, looking down. He wears a uraeus on his
crown,'' an ornamental cobra favored by New Kingdom pharaohs.
   The nine colossi that Ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs
and have straight mouths, rectangular faces, thick cheeks and eyes
staring straight ahead. The kilts are short.
   Despite Ms. Sourouzian's research, the identity of the colossus
scheduled to arrive home from America on Dec. 6 is not in question,
said Egyptian antiquities official Zahi Hawass.
   ``When the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient
Memhis, the name we'll put under it is Ramses II,'' he said.

<DATELINE>VALLEY OF THE QUEENS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the Queens.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   LeBlanc said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because Hathor's realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the West Bank across the Nile from present-day Luxor.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the Valley of the Kings. Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
   That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the
Kings. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the West Bank. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the Queens, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the Valley of the Kings.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' LeBlanc said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of Ramses II's powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
Nefret, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, Leblanc said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens.
It was Schiaparelli, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.

<DATELINE>LEPTIS MAGNA, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flood has severely damaged one of
the world's greatest ancient cities, and the Libyan government has
appealed for help in repairing the ruins of the once-glorious Roman
metropolis.
   A torrent of water rushed over Leptis Magna, about 75 miles east
of Tripoli, in November after several days of heavy rains sent
water over a dam three miles from the ancient trading center on the
Mediterranean coast.
   For three days, the rampaging river carried tons of dirt and
uprooted vegetation through the ruins, leaving mud yards deep in
such remarkable areas as the Roman Emperor Hadrian's baths and one
of two forums.
   Most heavily damaged was the Colonnaded Street, a 400-yard-long
road on which visitors strolled from the bath complex to the
ancient port. Much of the stone carriageway, lined with more than
200 marble columns with lotus designs, broke under the weight of
the floodwaters.
   The port end of the street disappeared and is now covered by a
small river. Near the heart of the ancient city, the waters reduced
the path to a jumble of stone blocks and columns fashioned from
Egyptian granite and Italian marble.
   Only the ancient market, theater and forum were spared the wrath
of the flood.
   Sandro Stucchi, an Italian archaeologist who surveyed the site,
estimated restoration would cost $33 million and take 10 years.
   Omar S. Almahgiub, superintendent of the archeological district
that includes Leptis Magna, said the Libyan government is hoping to
restore the site with help from the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
   ``We want to make an appeal to all people who love monuments,''
said Almahgiub, looking at the weeds sprouting from several inches
of sun-baked dirt covering the base of the basilica's pulpit.
   Almahgiub, who was born in Leptis and whose father was a
caretaker of the site, said Libya would provide the personnel to do
the manual work but doesn't have the technical expertise.
   Bekaddour Ouldali of UNESCO in Paris said the organization has
asked Italy _which colonized Libya until World War II _ to provide
funds for a archaeological supervisor, preferably Stucchi, and has
provided earth-removal equipment and a pump in case a flood strikes
again.
   An Italian Foreign Ministry official, Manfredo Incisa, says his
government is willing to help but is waiting for a more detailed
report from UNESCO.
   Little is known outside Libya about the disaster because Libya's
magnificent archaeological inheritance is not easily seen.
   Tourism per se doesn't exist in the state ruled by Col. Moammar
Gadhafi. A recent summer Tuesday brought only about a dozen
visitors to Leptis Magna, almost all of them foreign diplomatic,
construction or oil employees.
   In addition, lovers of archaeology must step delicately in
Libya, whose regime frequently rails against foreign imperialism.
For the more militant Gadhafi supporters, reminders of ancient
colonialism like Leptis Magna are unwanted souvenirs to be
destroyed.
   Italians began excavating the sprawling city about 1912, the
same year the Rome-based government of dictator Benito Mussolini
occupied Libya, which Italy controlled until the arrival of the
Allied forces in 1943.
   The flood halted dreams for extensive excavation of the harbor,
considered one of the best preserved in the ancient Roman world and
expected to yield many relics from Leptis' beginnings as a key
Phoenician port and later a prosperous Roman city.
   Leptis was founded by seafaring Phoenicians from Carthage as a
trading post in the first millennium B.C. As merchants developed a
brisk business in ivory, ebony, slaves, gold and precious stones
from Africa, the site was established as a colony of Carthage about
the 7th or 6th century B.C.
   In 101 B.C., Leptis became an ally of Rome and its residents
gained full rights of citizenship.
   The city prospered during the reign of Emperor Septimius
Severus, who was born here in A.D. 193 and whose arch of triumph
greets visitors.
   With the decline of the Roman empire, Leptis eventually
succumbed to the raids of Germanic tribes that maintained a kingdom
in North Africa in the 5th century, then to Byzantine rule in the
4th century and finally to an Arab invasion in 642.
   Its name may derive from a Phoenician combination ``li'' and
``bada,'' meaning town at the edge of the desert. ``Magna'' _
meaning great in Latin _ has been added to distinguish the town
from another Leptis in Tunisia.
   Libya's rich collection of archaeological sites include
prehistoric cave paintings in the south, the ruins of a Greek site
called Sabratha west of Tripoli, and various relics from the series
of conquerors.

   Archaeologists have dug up a wall in the heart of
the Roman Forum that could help them discover the secrets of the
founding of Rome. The city could be older than it thinks it is.
   The archaeologists say the dicovery also could find some truth
in the legend of Romulus and Remus.
   According to the legend, Romulus established Rome by building a
defensive wall around the Palatine Hill, the site where he and his
twin brother, Remus, were suckled in their infancy by a she-wolf
and reared by a shepherd. Romulus then founded Rome in 753 B.C., as
the legend goes.
   While the archaeologists don't believe they'll find any proof of
Romulus, Remus, the she-wolf and the shepherd, they do think they
might find some truth in the legend about the way Rome was founded
and when.
   Andrea Carandini, a University of Pisa professor who is leading
the dig, said archaeologists in May uncovered a stone wall on a
slope of the hill just at the spot described by the ancient Roman
historian Tacitus as the site of the wall that first defined and
protected Rome.
   Experts have dated the find to the 7th century B.C., but
Carandini said in an interview he suspects underneath it is an
earlier version of a defensive wall that could have been built a
century earlier.
   Archaeologists say reaching the wall could be the first tangible
piece of evidence to back up the story of Rome's legendary founding
in 753 B.C.
   But secrets of the earliest days of Roman civilization may stay
locked in the ground if the government fund that has financed the
dig for the last three years is not replenished. Carandini says the
team needs the equivalent of about $400,000 to continue.
   For now Carandini keeps digging.
   ``We will never discover the wall of Romulus because Romulus is
a legend, of course,'' he said. ``But I think the nucleus of the
legend is right, and in a way, we already proved this because
nobody believed that there really was a fortification of the
Palatine Hill.''
   The base of the hill eventually developed into the Forum,
ancient Rome's market and meeting place, now a major tourist
attraction.
   Experts who have observed the excavations say the discoveries,
if fully documented, will provide significant insight into the
little-known period between the 8th and 6th centuries B.C.
   ``It is interesting that the physical objects that (Carandini)
is discovering not only seem to be dated very early in the history
of the city but are related to the historical texts that talk about
the foundation of the city,'' said Richard Brilliant, a professor
of art history and archaeology at Columbia University in New York,
who visited the site in May.
   ``Whether or not conclusions can be drawn about the wall in the
development of the city is something much more research is needed
to demonstrate.''
   Alessandro Guidi, an official with the regional archaeology
office, said the find indicates that Rome may have evolved much
earlier than was once believed from a primitive village inhabited
mainly by shepherds into a more advanced society.
   ``This could be very important because it may be proof that
before the Etruscans conquered Rome, Rome already was a very big
center,'' Guidi said.
   The defensive wall, discovered about 10 feet below a grassy
surface, probably surrounded a ``pomoerium,'' or holy place, in the
city that had been founded with the gods' blessings, Carandini said.
   Above the excavated wall, archaeologist found remnants of houses
they believe date back to the end of the 6th century B.C. and
belonged to aristocrats of Etruscan origins.
   The houses probably were built after the defensive wall was
expanded to surround the seven hills of Rome, Carandini said.
   But it is what lies below the wall that may give real insight
into the founding of one of the world's most ancient civilizations.
   ``We go with clues like Sherlock Holmes,'' Carandini said. ``It
is the only way we have of checking the history of Rome, which at
this point is a legend. But I think a legend is another way of
writing history.''

<TEXT>
   The discovery of five ancient statues has
transformed a tranquil courtyard of Luxor Temple into an
archaeologist's dream.
   ``We want to discover who buried the statues, why and when,''
Mohammed Saghir, the Luxor area's director of antiquities, said as
diggers' picks and shovels turn the silty earth in search of more
statues.
   Since the Jan. 22 discovery of the well-preserved statues,
experts have debated whether more lie near them beside towering
columns on the north side of the courtyard of Pharaoh Amenophis III,
who ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C.
   The courtyard, just over 57 yards long by 50{ yards wide, is
considered the glory of Luxor Temple, a fabled remain altered and
reworked by many of ancient Egypt's best-known rulers.
   On a recent Sunday, four of the statues, covered in padded vinyl
and tied so only their toes peeked out, sat in their burial pit.
Workers dug around them as small boys carted basketfuls of dirt to
mounds near an outer temple wall on which Ramses II, in a chariot,
smites the ill-fated enemies of Egypt.
   Each digger hopes to be the next el-Rayees Farouk, chief of
temple workers, who was credited with finding the edge of a buried
granite statue base that had shielded the figures from generations
of footsteps.
   Farouk, in a brown galabeya, or robe, his head swathed in the
traditional scarf of southern Egypt, shouted orders to his men as
they excavated.
   They've found no additional large statues, but Saghir said the
dig had turned up a small bronze of the god Osiris, lord of the
underworld; part of a stela or commemorative plaque; copper tools,
and other small artifacts.
   Some light has been shed on mysteries of the discovery, one of a
number of group burials by ancient Egyptians.
   ``We know this burial was not accidental,'' Saghir said. ``These
statues were placed lovingly in the earth, their sides turned toward
the west. Not only did the ancients protect the statues by putting a
base over them, but they took the care to seal the pit with a layer
of gypsum and limestone chips. They wanted to save them for
eternity.''
   The base, a granite slab with two niches carved in it, apparently
once held two of the statues found in January. The general, and
later pharaoh, Haremhab, knelt in a rounded-off rectangle with
offerings before a seated creator god, Atum, that fit in a
rectangular niche, according to measurements.
   A third statue found in January is of the goddess Hathor, patron
of beauty and womanhood, and the fourth is a minor goddess, Yunet.
   Originally, the base lay on the ground inside the temple. At some
time, for reasons unknown, the ancients decided to bury the statues.
They put them in a hole, covered it with dirt, gypsum and stone,
then put the base on top and covered it with dirt _ much like the
layers in a sandwich.
   Saghir and others think the base may have provided protection, or
may have had some magical significance. It only actually covers a
quartzite statue of Amenophis III, which Saghir said was the most
important find.
   The statue depicts Amenophis III standing on a sledge to
demonstrate his divinity. Tomb paintings and small wooden statues
exist showing him in such a pose, but the stone statue standing more
than eight feet tall is unique.
   Over 34 centuries Amenophis III has remained among ancient
Egypt's most fascinating personalities. Early in his reign he
claimed to have killed 102 fierce lions. He brags in heiroglyphs on
the new statue that he controls land from Nubia, ranging from
southern Egypt through what is now northern Sudan, to the Euphrates
River to the east to the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. In
later life, Amenophis III preferred luxury to prowess. A patron of
the arts, he demanded magnificent monuments and the finest works
craftsmen could produce.
   The five statues show the masters' touch, and conservation
experts from Cairo will have the job of ensuring their safety in the
modern world. They have been moved from the courtyard to a special
storage area at Luxor.
   Saghir said he's just beginning to have the time to think about
what's been found. ``Finding something by surprise and discovering
it in a regular excavation give different feelings,'' he said.
   ``The first night after these statues were found I couldn't
sleep. I went to Luxor Temple at 11 p.m. and walked in the
moonlight. I went home. At 2 a.m. I went again to the Temple. I was
trying to decide what to do next. I was so afraid something would
happen to them. I knew at first sight we had a cache.''
   The statues may have been put in hiding for safekeeping during
the Assyrian invasion, he said. That west Asian empire conquered
Egypt in 671 B.C., and for years its soldiers ransacked and
plundered monuments throughout the country.
   However, Egypt suffered ups and downs as early as 100 years after
Amenophis built Luxor Temple, when the pharaohs began to decline
after the 66-year reign of Ramses II, and that may account for the
statues' burial.
   In Cairo, Rainer Stadelmann, director of the German
Archaeological Institute and one of the profession's most respected
scholars, said he believes the order in which the statues were
buried gives history a hint.
   ``The best choice'' for the time of burial would have been during
the reign of Ramses II, who expanded and redesigned Luxor Temple, he
said. ``Perhaps they bothered Ramses in some way or interfered with
his processions.''
   He reasons that the statues were grouped as they are for a reason.
   ``To me they represent the west, the setting sun,'' Stadelmann
said. ``If this is true, then we can expect in the opposite
courtyard to find another grouping, this time representing the east,
the rising sun.''
   He characterized his ideas as fantasies because the discovery is
so new, but said he expects that the statues lined the sides of the
festival courtyard in ancient times to produce a processional
journey for the sun god.
   ``We have these processions painted on walls, but in this case it
could have been done with statues. To the ancients it wouldn't have
mattered if the pharaoh were dead or if the statues later were
buried...
   ``The journey would continue.''

<HEAD>Modern Battleground Revealing Evidence Of Biblical Conflicts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   AFIQ, Israeli-Annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ With the thud of
modern artillery in the background, archeologists are uncovering
evidence that the Golan Heights was as fierce a battleground in
biblical times as it is today.
   ``The battles between the Arameans (of ancient Syria) and
Israelis were governed by the same geopolitical considerations as
today: Whoever holds the high ground has a strategic advantage,''
said archeologist Moshe Kohavi, head of a Tel Aviv University
expedition excavating four sites in the Golan Heights with the help
of American, Japanese, Finnish and Israeli volunteers.
   The sites are the Leviah Enclosure, a wedge-shaped promontory
over the Sea of Galilee with gorges on three sides and high walls
on the fourth; Tel Hadar, where a large royal ``winter palace'' has
been unearthed on the eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee; Tel
Soreg, a hilltop town on the Ein Gev river; and Rogem Hiri, which
has been nicknamed the ``Stonehenge of the Golan.''
   Afiq, a kibbutz where the archeologists are based, preserves the
name of the biblical Aphek, the 9th century B.C. battleground where
the Israelite King Ahab's chariots and foot soldiers defeated the
army of Ben Haddad, the Aramean king, who had conquered much of
Israel after sweeping across the Golan.
   ``Ahab fought for the same advantage as we do,'' said Kohavi,
alluding to Israel's battles with Syria for the Golan in 1967 and
1973. Israel annexed the 42- by 15-mile territory with its 20,000
residents in 1981.
   Although ancient sites dot the map of the Golan, most are
unexplored. The Syrians put the area off limits as a military zone
and foreign expeditions have for the most part avoided it since
1967 because it is still disputed.
   ``There are more ancient sites than modern ones,'' said Matti
Zohar, a Hebrew University of Jerusalem archeologist working with
Kohavi's expedition.
   Evidence to support the Golan's historical status as a
battlefield comes mainly from the cities' construction, especially
the high walls.
   An iron arrowhead was found at Tel Hadar and a dog-shaped bronze
finial, the top of a standard, was found at Tel Soreg.
   ``Weapons and armor were precious because they were made of
metal,'' Kohavi said. ``It was very expensive and was not left
lying on the battlefield. What is found is usually discovered in
caches or in tombs but this is rare.''
   City walls, the main entrance, private houses and public
buildings at Leviah indicate it was a city spread over 20 acres
rather than a fort or large cattle pen as previously believed. The
emphasis on walls and natural defense gives insight into life
during the Bronze Age, 3,000-2,000 B.C.
   ``The people lived in large cities, probably war-like ones, and
they chose their sites for strategic reasons,'' Kohavi said of a
half-dozen similar sites in the Golan. ``There was apparently no
major power to pacify the area.''
   ``These were large fortified cities that probably fought each
other like the Greek city states,'' he said, standing on the
ancient city's stone gate and sweeping his hand toward three large
squares stretching across about 100 yards, where Israeli students
from the Technion University in Haifa were digging out rows of
stone that were the walls of ancient houses.
   Leviah was an exciting find, Kohavi said, because it ``proves
that the Golan was a thriving population center'' as early as the
4th century B.C. ``and not a fringe area as had been believed.''
The pottery and building style also indicated links with ancient
Lebanon.
   Only a few miles from Syria, the distant rumble of tank and
artillery could be heard as Israeli troops conducted maneuvers.
``We can't escape from what's going on in today's Golan,'' said
Kohavi.
   Throughout the Old Testament period the Golan Heights, a
volcanic plain 1,650 feet above the Sea of Galilee, was the focus
of a power struggle between the Kings of Israel and the Arameans
who were based near modern-day Damascus.
   Its importance was recognized by King David, who sought to
neutralize the power of the ruler of the Land of Geshur, as the
Golan was known, by marrying his daughter Maacah. Their son Absalom
later led a rebellion against David.
   Kohavi, seeking the first archeological evidence to confirm the
biblical stories, believes one seat of Geshur government may have
been Tel Hadar, which was in a no-man's land between Israeli and
Syrian armies before 1967, and sits on a rise surrounded with weeds
and barbed wire near a crowded summer resort.
   Archeologists have unearthed a large royal ``winter palace''
there on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The palace, which
covered two acres next to what is now an amusement park, was
destroyed by fire at the end of the 11th century B.C. The most
visually striking aspect of the dig are granaries in the palace's
basement. An archaeologist bent and picked up pieces of burnt grain
more than 25 centuries old to show a reporter.
   A bulldozer helped remove large basalt stones from around the
entrance to the ancient palace. Among the finds were two delicately
carved legs to a basalt stoneware pot and a perfectly preserved
long-necked beer jug that was twisted and partially melted by the
intense blaze.
   At Tel Soreg, midway between the Sea of Galilee and Afiq,
volunteers sifted the remains of the settlement that was
continuously inhabitated for 2,000 years and is believed by some to
have been the biblical Aphek, a possibility Kohavi discounts
because it was too small to match the biblical descriptions.
   The Golan's battles even touched Tel Soreg, though it was out of
the path of armies marching across the plateau two miles away.
``When the Arameans and Israelites were fighting, the residents of
Tel Soreg built a high wall for defense,'' in the 9th and 8th
centuries B.C., he said.
   Zohar is trying to unravel the mystery of Rogem Hiri, which the
Druse Arabs have named the ``stone heap of the wild cat.''
   The four concentric circles of stone walls with a 6{-yard-high
mound of stones in the middle has been likened to Stonehenge, the
Neolithic stone circle in England. Like Stonehenge, it may have
been an astronomical observatory; the entrance marks the point of
sunrise on the longest day of the year.
   ``It has to be a burial site,'' said Zohar, standing on the
central heap of black volcanic stones. The cone-shaped core had
collapsed and the original structure resembled a stepped pyramid
like those found in ancient Egypt.
   Pottery found there this year dates the site to about 3000 B.C.

   Hassan Ragab's dreams once fit into a
bathtub. Thirty years later they cover an island in the Nile and
have made him not only Egypt's papyrus king but also Pharaoh of a
imaginary kingdom from the days of King Tut.
   The realm of the 78-year-old former diplomat and engineer is
Jacob's Island, a finger of land south of Cairo where he first
established a papyrus farm, then re-created a 3,300-year-old
village to give tourists glimpses of ancient Egyptian life from
flat-bottom barges.
   Papyrus is everywhere on the island.
   His love affair with the willowy river plant began in 1955,
after his appointment as Egypt's first ambassador to China. On a
countryside tour, he saw workers making paper by hand.
   ``I thought of my own country, once world-famous for producing
paper from the papyrus plant,'' he said. ``Everything was written
on it, from peace treaties to marriage contracts to medical
instructions.''
   But by the middle of the 20th century, ``papyrus was finished in
Egypt, except for a few ornamental plants,'' he added. ``I thought
how great it would be if I could start a little industry, making
paper again.''
   In 1960, with papyrus stalks he cut in Sudan, Ragab began
experimenting in his bathtub.
   No one else could help him, he said, because papyrus-making,
like mummification, was so sacred the ancients reserved it for the
Pharaohs.
   For six years Ragab cut papyrus pulp into strips, soaked them,
dried them, hammered and pressed them into sheets.
   Nothing worked.
   ``I was down to my last coin,'' he said. ``Even my family
thought I was stupid. One day my wife came in and gave me a choice
of her or the dirty bathtub.
   ``But fortunately, for the papyrus industry and for me, I
discovered my mistakes. I still had both a wife and a bathtub.''
   Ragab opened his first Papyrus Institute, which he called ``One
of the Seven Wonders of Modern Egypt,'' on a little houseboat in
the Nile in 1966, growing the plant in surrounding Nile shallows.
   His papyrus paper attracted artists, who duplicated tomb
paintings, golden faces of King Tut and ancient medical manuscripts.
   Lightweight and exotic, papyrus is ``the only true Egyptian
souvenir,'' Ragab said. Egyptian presidents give papyrus as gifts.
In 1984, President Hosni Mubarak went to Washington with a Ragab
portrait of the Sphinx with President Ronald Reagan's face instead
of a Pharaoh's.
   Ragab estimates his industry now earns $100 million a year
locally, $40 million internationally.
   But Ragab's success was too great. Hundreds of papyrus factories
sprang up, many making fake paper from banana skins or corn husks.
Few tourists could tell the difference.
   ``You even have two villages with 30,000 people who gave up
farming a couple of years ago, just to grow, make, paint and market
papyrus,'' Ragab said.
   He then had another idea.
   ``I realized there was no place for a tourist to learn about
ancient Egypt, about what he was seeing in the museums,'' he said.
``And I looked at Jacob's Island.''
   What he saw in his mind's eye was ``a living village from the
golden days of the New Kingdom, the time of King Tut and Ramses.''
   He started work on it in the early 1980s, hired actors to take
the roles of ancient Egyptians and by the time Dr. Ragab's
Pharaonic Village opened in 1985, he had poured $8 million into it,
a fortune built with papyrus.
   But tourist agencies avoided it and many still do. Tour books
didn't mention it and most still don't.
   But Ragab holds on.
   ``This should be the first stop for any tourist,'' said art
teacher Pat Cline, of Ingleside, Ill., in front of a scaled-down
Pharaonic temple. ``It teaches you so much. It's going to be one of
our favorite highlights of Egypt.''
   Equally as enthusiastic was Dr. Adel Ibrahim, a surgeon from
Huntington, W.Va., who had brought his wife and three children to
Egypt to learn something of his native land.
   ``It's a miracle,'' Ibrahim told Ragab. ``You've done Egypt
proud.''
   Ragab smiled.

   I enjoyed your May 15 page-one account of Rabbi Eliyahu
Avichail's search for "the 10 Lost Tribes of Israel," but I
did find a discrepancy. You state that the 10 tribes were
dispersed across Asia after the Assyrians smashed the First
Jewish Temple more than 2,700 years ago. It was not the
Assyrians who destroyed the First Jewish Temple in 722 B.C.,
but the Babylonians in 536 B.C.
   The United Kingdom of Israel was ruled first by King Saul,
followed by King David and then by David's son, King Solomon.
David made Jerusalem the capital; the First Temple was built
in Jerusalem by Solomon. Solomon oppressed the people through
heavy spending, taxes and forced labor. After his death, the
people asked his son, King Rehoboam, to lighten the burden of
government on them, but he refused. This denial led the
northern tribes (normally called the 10 tribes) to secede and
form a nation known as Israel under the leadership of King
Jeroboam. The southern tribes stayed true to King Rehoboam,
forming a separate nation known as Judah, with its capital at
Jerusalem.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Israel (the northern confederation) eventually established
its capital at Samaria (north of Jerusalem) under King Omri.
According to the Bible, Israel (NC) displeased God by its
worship of idols, and other sins, and as a result was
conquered by the Assyrians under Shalmaneser in 722 B.C. The
citizens of Israel (NC) were then dispersed as described in
your article.
   Assyria also attempted to conquer Judah in 701 B.C., but
was stopped short at Jerusalem when God intervened.
   Assyria in turn was conquered by Babylon in 626 B.C.
   Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar defeated Judah in 586
B.C., destroying Jerusalem and the First Temple.
   The people of Judah were deported to Babylon (modern Iraq)
for a period of 70 years. Babylon in turn was defeated by the
Medes and Persians under Cyrus the Great, who allowed the
Jews to return to Palestine to rebuild Jerusalem and the
temple. Persia was later defeated by Greece, which was
defeated by Rome prior to the birth of Jesus Christ.

   As much as I sympathize with Chima Onyeulo (a member of
the Ibo tribe of southern Nigeria) in his quest for a
homeland, it seems to me he has fallen victim to the idea of
"Ibo-Jewry." "Ibo-Jewry" was first proposed by a segment of
the British aristocracy to explain the plight of the Ibos
during the Nigerian-Biafran civil war. Moreover, the
revelations of Innocent the tribesman hardly qualify as an
irrefutable proof of "Ibo-Jewry."
   As a biblical scholar familiar with the Menelik dynasty of
Ethiopia, I can tell you that the only Africans who can
possibly lay any claims to Jewish ancestry are the Ethiopian
Jews. Following the love affair between King Solomon and
Queen Sheba of Sabo, a male offspring named Ebna Hakim, or
Son of the Wise One, was conceived. After his childhood days
in Ethiopia, he was sent to his father in Judea for tutelage.
On his way back to Ethiopia, his father sent some reluctant
scholars and priests to escort him back, thereby ensuring
that the teachings as contained in the "Kebra-Nagest,"
Ethiopia's holiest of books, which he authored, were strictly
adhered to. This is at least one of the versions of the story
of the Jewish migration to Ethiopia.
   The similarities between the Jewish and Ibo socio-cultural
evolution are by no means scientific determinants that result
in Ibo-Jews or Jew-Ibos. These same similarities could
readily exist between Ibos and an ethnic group in Yugoslavia
or in the Russian republic.
   Furthermore, the Ibos are forever grateful to the Jewish
state for the powerful assistance that it rendered during the
Nigerian-Biafran civil war. But that does not by itself
justify an Ibo exodus to Israel. I believe the Ibos are happy
right where they are. Remember, the blood of their heroes was
shed in their quest for justice in Nigeria.

<LEADPARA>  Long before Noah supposedly planted his vineyard after the Flood or the first
toast was drunk to Dionysus on the shores of Homer's wine-dark sea, the taste
of the grape was one of life's pleasures.;    Archaeologists have found
chemical evidence that people were making and drinking wine at least as long
ago as the fourth millennium B.C. (3000-4000 B.C.), the earliest established
occurrence of wine anywhere in the world.  </LEADPARA>

PAST.
3500 B.C.: IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR IN SUMER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     And a robust vintage it must have been, to have left a trace at all. The
bouquet was long gone, of course. But there inside an earthen jar from
Sumerian ruins excavated at Godin Tepe in western Iran were red-colored
deposits, a residue that chemists determined was rich in tartaric acid and so
almost certainly was the dregs of an ancient wine. Tartaric acid is found in
nature almost exclusively in grapes.;    "We're 95 percent sure," said Dr.
Patrick E. McGovern, an archaeological chemist who directed the analysis at
the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of
Pennsylvania.;    The results, determined by a technique known as infrared
spectroscopy, are reported in the current issue of a museum publication,
Research Papers in Science and Archaeology.;    Anthropologists said the
findings would yield insights into the economy and stability of a society able
to indulge in the production of a luxury item like wine.;    This should help
fill out the cultural picture of the fourth millennium B.C. in the Middle
East, a time of social innovation with the invention of writing, the
introduction of copper metallurgy and irrigated agriculture and the rise of
urban centers.;    Dr. Solomon H. Katz, an anthropologist at the University of
Pennsylvania and a specialist on the early history of beverages, said he
believes that the dramatic cultural changes of the period encouraged not only
production of wine but its consumption.;    Stress reliever;    People
probably imbibed to relieve the stresses of living in an increasingly complex
and urbanized society, he said.;    If the chemical analysis is correct, it
confirms the existence of wine about 3500 B.C.;    "We've broken the Bronze
Age barrier," Katz said, suggesting that the origins of wine-making probably
extend back several thousand more years.;    In "Vintage: The Story of Wine,"
Hugh Johnson, a wine expert, wrote, "We cannot point precisely to the place
and time when wine was first made any more than we can give credit to the
inventor of the wheel.";    Grape seeds from the seventh millennium B.C. have
been found in the Caucasus, near the Caspian Sea in what is now the Soviet
Union, but it is not certain that these were from domesticated plants.;    The
earliest firm evidence for wine had been in Egyptian texts referring to wine
at the beginning of the third millennium, the dawn of the Bronze Age.;    The
Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh from the same millennium celebrated the enchanted
vineyard whose wine was said to be the source of immortality. Wine must have
been common by the time of Hammurabi, the Babylonian king in the 1700s B.C.,
because his laws were explicit on the subject of when and how people could
drink.;    Wine symposium;    The new findings will be evaluated by
anthropologists and historians at a symposium this week on wine's role in the
cultural and economic development of earliest human societies.;    The
participants, invited by the University Museum, will get into the spirit of
their scholarship by meeting at the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville in the
Napa Valley.;    The unearthed Sumerian jar's telltale residues were
discovered by Virginia R. Badler, a graduate student in archaeology at the
University of Toronto.;    In research on the Uruk period of Mesopotamia, she
pieced together shards from pottery excavated at Godin Tepe in the Zagros
Mountains of western Iran between the modern towns of Hamadan and Kermanshah.;
   Red stain;    When Badler reconstructed one large jar from Godin Tepe, she
noticed the red stain on the interior at the base and on one side, evidence
that the vessel had contained a liquid and had been stored on its side,
presumably to keep the seal moist and tight and thus prevent wine from turning
to vinegar.;    Other evidence included the shape of the jar, with its narrow
mouth and tall neck that seemed suited for pouring out liquids, and the
presence of earthenware stoppers and funnels.;    Similar jars were found in
one room that appeared to have been where the wine was made or at least
stored.;    Across a courtyard, opened jars were excavated in what seemed to
be the residence of people of some affluence, judging from luxury items like a
stone-bead necklace and a marble bowl fragment found there.;    "Almost from
the start, wine is a high-end item, a status symbol," Katz said.;    In
previous studies, Katz traced the origin of beer, brewed from barley, to the
time soon after the introduction of agriculture in the Middle East about
10,000 years ago.;    Beer more available;    Since grain could be grown more
widely and be stored for long periods, beer became more readily available than
the seasonal, more perishable grapes.;    Katz said in an interview that he
was developing a hypothesis on the early history of wine. Even before modern
agriculture, people could have discovered ripe wild grapes that had fallen to
the ground and fermented.;    The yeast for fermentation comes naturally to
grapes, as the waxy white stuff on the skin. People who tasted these grapes
got a glow on, and figured out how to get more, first from wild grapes crushed
in a bag and then by domesticating the vines for higher production.;    With
the introduction of agriculture, people became more settled and could produce
more than they needed for subsistence.;    For the first time, Katz said,
people "had enough security and stability and foresight to be willing to
invest in the future.";    He noted that the olive tree is the classic
example. "It is said, you grow olive trees for your grandchildren," he
observed, "and it's much the same with vineyards."  </TEXT>

   Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient
cemetery in northern Israel and say the 3,000-year-old finds
indicate the Phoenicians were landlubbers before they went to sea
and dominated the Mediterranean.
   The Phoenicians emerged about 1,000 B.C. and established
city-states throughout the Mediterranean Basin from Lebanon to
Spain, surviving until Roman times.
   Pottery, jewelry and other remains of their cities show a
variety of influences from Greek cultures in the Aegean as well as
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
   But little is known of the origins of the ancient Phoenicians.
   Evidence uncovered by a Hebrew University team in the tombs at
Achziv near Israel's border with Lebanon point to a Semitic
background, either from the ancient land of Israel, also known as
Canaan, or further inland.
   The team declined to give a specific location of the cemetery
for fear of plunderers; they believe artifacts and gold may be
buried in the tombs.
   Elat Mazar, an archaeologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
said the architecture of the tombs carved into the bedrock linked
the early Phoenicians to the ancient Hittites, a Semitic people who
lived in what is now Turkey and Syria and had no significant
sailing tradition.
   ``We found a hole in the ceiling on the tomb which is
characteristic of Hittite burial chambers,'' she said. ``In their
cult of the dead, it was a symbolic link between the living world
and the world of the dead.''
   She added that the Phoenicians had a sophisicated society with
advanced sailing technology, refined tastes in jewelry and an
unparalled ability to adapt material from other cultures.
   ``There is no question they were more developed than the
Israelite culture of the time. They were Semitic and close to the
Israelites but different.''
   The pack-rat characteristic of borrowing from neighboring
societies made the Phoenicians something of a mystery, however.
   Patricia Smith, a British-born anthropologist and dentist
interviewed at her laboratory in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital,
said a study of the ancient human remains show the physical
features of the Phoenicians were Semitic.
   ``This was no Greek,'' said Ms. Smith, turning the skull of a
Phoenician and pointing to the wide skull, arch of the nose and the
high cheekbones. A cast of an Israelite skull from the same eighth
to seventh century B.C. period had similar features.
   From his teeth, Smith deduced that the man, 45 to 50 years old
when he died, suffered either from fever or hunger in his infancy
but was quite fit as an adult, with not a single tooth cavity.
   ``Apart from this hole in his head, he was very healthy,'' Smith
said of the Phoenician, who died of a powerful blow to the back of
his head, apparently struck by a heavy blunt instrument.
   The Israeli expedition unearthed about 50 skeletons from two
cave tombs measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet. The cemetery covers
seven acres and may contain the remains of thousands of Phoenicians
spanning almost the entire 1,000-year life of their society here.
   Ms. Smith said she hoped to use the remains, especially the
skulls, to recreate the general ``Phoenician look.''
   ``It will be very exiting to find out who the Phoenicians were.''
   Ms. Smith uses video cameras and still photography to recreate
faces. She employed the technique on behalf of the prosecution in
the trial of John Demjanjuk, a Cleveland, Ohio, autoworker
convicted last year in Israel of Nazi war crimes and sentenced to
death.
   She made a video that superimposed a recent video image of
Demjanjuk on a 40-year-old Nazi identity card to show it was the
same man.
   With the Phoenicians, she plans to use the same technique to
superimpose video images from ancient drawings of Phoenicians and
modern sketches over the skulls themselves.
   ``I would be able to define a type, but not an individual. We
should be able to tell how varied the Phoenicians were,'' she said,
explaining that a perfect re-creation was impossible without
knowing the features of soft tissue such as eyelids, ears and lips.

<TEXT>
   When Alexander the Great founded his capital
on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, he intended it to dominate the
world. It did, but not through military force as he imagined.
   Alexandria dominated through knowledge and culture, and at the
heart of its glory was the greatest library in the history of the
world.
   The Library of Alexandria lasted for hundreds of years after the
conqueror's death in Babylon at age 33 but it disappeared with few
traces early in the Christian era.
   Now, almost 2,000 years later, Egypt is embarking on a project
to restore Alexandria's cultural prominence by creating a new
library as a symbol of where Egypt's been and where it's going.
   ``We want others to see Egypt from the right point of view, as a
country of civilization,'' said Ahmed Fathy Sorour, Egypt's
minister of education, who is heading the project.
   ``We are much more than keepers of the pyramids. We are reviving
the concept of the Alexandria Library ... in order to prove to the
world that Egypt's civilization didn't go away but is a living
tradition.''
   The site is ready and the design chosen for the projected $180
million-complex that officials say will bring new life to an old
but honored city.
   The site is prime Mediterranean seafront, backed by the bustle
of Alexandria's 4 million people. On the horizon is the
10th-century fortress of Qait Bey, built where one of the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pharos Lighthouse, purportedly
stood.
   The design by the Norwegian architectural firm Snoehetta is for
the new Alexandria Library to be a sweeping circle of concrete,
steel, glass and stone _a symbol of the sun.
   If an international fund-raising drive now under way succeeds
and the project meets its schedule, the library complex will be
completed by 1995.
   Recapturing ancient glory won't be easy, for few cities have a
more impressive early history than Alexandria's.
   Founded in 331 B.C., it beckoned the greats of its time, who in
turn gave the world a harvest of their best thoughts and
inventions: the pipe organ, the Archimedes screw, the atlas and
12-month, 365-day year, grammar and geography, geometry and
trigonometry, steam and fire engines, coin-operated machines, city
planning, and cataloging.
   From Alexandria came news that the Earth revolved around the
sun. Alexandrian scholars calculated the circumference of the Earth
to within 50 miles and the length of the solar year to within six
minutes.
   Poetry and prose abounded. They emptied from the
Athens-Alexandria axis into ports around the world, Greek becoming
Roman becoming Western heritage.
   Alexandrian culture revolved around an academic complex called
the Moseion, a think tank for Mediterranean intellectuals with the
freedom and the means to create at will. At the heart of the
Moseion was the library.
   Both were thriving by 285 B.C., a half-century before
establishment of a second, even greater Alexandria Library known to
scholars as the daughter library. It eventually contained an
estimated 500,000 volumes, a trove so vast 120 parchment scrolls
were required to catalog it.
   The collection included the 200,000 volumes of the Pergamum
Library, carted away from what is now Turkey by love-smitten Mark
Antony as a gift for Cleopatra.
   Debate continues over the fate of the ancient Alexandria
libraries. Some historians contend they were destroyed during
Jewish revolts of A.D. 115-117. Others say Christians who rioted
against pagan ways in A.D. 391 destroyed them.
   There appears little evidence the institutions survived long
enough to be destroyed by Arab invaders hundreds of years later, as
many early Western scholars wrote.
   Whatever happened, the libraries and records about them were so
thoroughly demolished that nobody knows for certain what they
looked like or even where they stood.
   The idea to revive the Alexandria Library was born in 1974.
University of Alexandria officials saw it as a way to perpetuate a
literary and cultural heritage long associated with their city,
still an educational headquarters for more than 80,000 students.
   They decided the first step would be a new library, but by the
time Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, laid the cornerstone June
26, 1988, the library had become an academic and social center. It
was to include a conference center, a planetarium, a scientists'
Hall of Fame, a calligraphy museum and other facilities.
   ``It's unfair for others to look on Egypt only as a developing
country struggling toward its economic development,'' Education
Minister Sorour said. ``The West owes much to other cultures,
including Egypt and later the Arabs.''

   AL-MATARIYA, Egypt (AP) _ Ancient Heliopolis, where legend says
the phoenix was resurrected from its own ashes, is buried or in
ruins. But like the fabulous bird that brought it fame, the city
itself is emerging from the ashes of time.
   Egyptian archaeologists are discovering remains under farmlands,
in the shadow of apartment high-rises, down alleyways and in
mid-campus at Ein Shams University.
   ``So much is left, but there's so much trouble getting to it,''
said Mohammed Abdel-Galil, chief antiquities inspector for
al-Matariya, a crowded suburb six miles north of downtown Cairo. He
is heading the search for ancient Heliopolis, struggling to keep a
step ahead of a critical need for space to accommodate an exploding
population.
   The isolated temple columns, mud-brick houses, fallen obelisk,
decorated tombs with star-studded ceilings and pieces of mummies
hint of the glory of the lost spiritual center the Greeks named
Heliopolis _ City of the Sun. It honored the sun god Re, whose
temple complex dominated ancient Egypt's history.
   An elegant reminder of Heliopolis' past, an obelisk, stands in
New York's Central Park. Its twin, the misnamed ``Cleopatra's
Needle,'' graces the bank of the Thames River in London.
   The most impressive Heliopolis remnant in its original home is a
solitary obelisk of red Aswan granite, erected almost 4,000 years
ago by Pharaoh Senwosret I. It weighs 121 tons and towers more than
67 feet above a quiet park amid the daily hubbub of modern life.
   Gamal Fares Abu-Fares, a young antiquities inspector, plucked a
blue faience statuette from a desecrated brick tomb more than 2,000
years old.
   ``Grave robbers took the valuable things and tossed relics like
this one aside,'' he said. ``The whole area is one vast cemetery.''
   Nearby, an angry-looking man paced back and forth _ the owner of
the construction site where the tomb was discovered.
   ``Every time we find another relic, he shakes his head,''
Abu-Fares said, explaining that it means the owner can do no work
until the excavators finish.
   By law, construction cannot begin in Egypt without a permit from
the Egyptian Antiquities Organization certifying the site's
historical unimportance.
   In al-Matariya, where the probability is high of archaeological
significance, Abu-Fares spends part of each day riding through new
housing areas checking building permits. His reception can be far
from friendly.
   ``Sometimes, we get into fistfights,'' he said.
   Historians fear for the city whose intellect dazzled early
Mediterraneans. It gave the world the obelisk. Its mathematicians
and astronomers created a solar calendar, 365 days divided into 12
months.
   Ancient Heliopolis' high priests created a think tank that
beckoned the leading brains of the day: the law-giver Solon came, as
did the mathematician Pythagoras. Plato spent years absorbing
Heliopolis' storehouse of knowledge.
   The sprawling modern suburb that Cairenes know as Heliopolis lies
southeast of the ancient city, which covered what is now Al-Matariya
and nearby areas.
   For almost 3,000 years of pharaohs, Heliopolis stood undaunted,
bowing only to a brash young Macedonian, Alexander the Great, who in
331 B.C. founded a rival city 130 miles to the north, Alexandria.
   By the time Christianity took hold more than 400 years later,
Heliopolis _ called ``On'' in the Old Testament _ was a ghost town.
Its remains were slowly covered by sand or they were carted away to
build the medieval city of Cairo.
   In legend, ancient Heliopolis lives side-by-side with the
phoenix. That dying magical bird set fire to itself on the altar in
the great temple of Re, and a new phoenix would fly from the ashes
to heaven, a promise to the ancients of resurrection.
   But two years ago, the city became far more than legend to
construction workers digging the foundation for an engineering
school at Ein Shams University, named for the spring where ancient
Egyptians believed the sun took its daily baths morning and night.
   As they dug, they unearthed evidence of a tomb, the first of an
eventual 15 that archaeologists would find.
   On a recent day at the dig, a tin can sat on the ground, holding
hundreds of colorful mummy beads that once adorned the dead. Skulls,
pieces of mummies hacked by grave robbers searching for jewelry and
layers of mummy wrappings were clearly evident in the
cross-sectioned hillside, frozen in time.
   To the din of nearby construction, excavators gingerly removed
remains with picks and shovels.
   A mile away, inspectors are excavating a large cemetery with
tombs decorated for officials 2,500 years ago. Sarcophagi line
uneven ground where a high-rise had been planned.
   Al-Matariya's Abdel-Galil, a soft-spoken man, constantly tours
such excavation sites, trying to piece together the meaning of
relics saved from steam shovel and pile driver. His work takes him
bumping from one rocky road to another, from modern suburb to remote
village, a 10-minute trip through a time tunnel.
   He said the most important find so far is a mile-long double
mud-brick wall separating a suburb from farming fields. According to
surviving accounts of early travelers to ancient Heliopolis, the
wall stretched for more than three miles, surrounding an enormous
city.
   In a quiet village about a mile from the wall, Abdel-Galil walked
among columns heralding the exploits of pharaohs Ramses III and
Ramses IV.
   ``We think a large temple of Ramses III is near here, maybe under
the fields,'' Abdel-Galil said. ``We have to find out, but we have
problems. The villagers don't have a sense of history.''

FT  02 APR 94 / Death is outwitted by gods reborn in spring: The many
celebrations of rebirth at Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULES CASHFORD and JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow, in thousands of Christian churches around the world, millions of
men and women will celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. They will
rejoice - in the words of the Apostles' Creed - in the historical figure who
'was crucified, dead and buried. He descended into hell. The third day, He
rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right
hand of God the Father Almighty.'
Tomorrow, children will open their Easter eggs. Churches will be decked with
flowers and, in some parts of Europe, bonfires will blaze. But we might
choose to remember that, far more than 2,000 years ago - long before the
birth of Christ, and at almost precisely the same time of the year -
countless people celebrated the re-birth of their own particular god from
death.
They believed there was not just one god but many - or, rather, many
different names for the same one. In Bronze Age Sumeria, around 2,500 BC,
they called him Dumuzi; in Babylonia, Tammuz; in ancient Egypt, Osiris.
Later, in Phrygia, he was Attis; in Canaan, Baal; and, in Greece, Dionysos
and Adonis. All of these gods died and descended into the underworld.
It happened to 'goddesses' too: Inanna in Mesopotamia and Persephone in
Greece. Many stayed there for three days; some for three months. Then, they
were rescued. Death variously was outwitted, cheated, forced to barter, even
killed. Life won a respite, an exchange, a deferral, a victory. Like winter,
death's dominion was only temporary.
Can we be surprised if these celebrations of rebirth over the millennia of
human history always take place in spring? Yesterday, on the holy Friday
Christians call 'Good', millions mourned the death of the son of God,
crucified on a cross in Golgotha - 'the place of a skull'. The churches were
dim, the altars bare, the priests wore black, the hymns were melancholy and
despairing.
This is the wasteland, where death is the end and even God dies, slain by
human ignorance. At this darkest point in the ceremony, the cross becomes
the focus, for this instrument of death now appears as the Tree of Life.
In early Christian iconography, the cross is often depicted as a tree, both
cut and budding, with lopped-off branches and green shoots, as in the 13th
century Evesham Psalter Cross. In Byzantine art, crosses twist into branches
and curl over into sprays of flowers. Rarely are they the distilled
abstractions of later Protestant meditation.
In the third century, Helena, mother of the Roman emperor Constantine,
travelled many lands in search of the true cross. In legend, this was made
from the Tree of Life which stood in the centre of the Garden of Eden, at
the source of four rivers, and granted immortality.
Standing in counterpoise to the Tree of Knowledge, the cross, as the Tree of
Life, thus redeems the fate of Adam whose skull became the skull at
Golgotha, burying Death. In the magnificent 16th century mosaic at the
Church of San Clemente in Rome, death and resurrection are portrayed in one
image. Christ stands against the cross as the trunk and branch of the Tree
of Life, its joyously-spiralling leaves extending into the universe. The
cross is the Cosmic Tree at the centre of the world. For Christian doctrine,
the symbol of the cross as the Tree of Life is entirely intelligible within
its own tradition.
Yet, these are universal symbols, far more ancient than Christianity, and
their recurrence in the myths and folklore of the world is arresting and
fascinating. Osiris of Egypt was imprisoned by his wicked brother, Seth, in
a coffin. It was thrown into the Nile but was washed ashore and came to rest
inside the trunk of a tamarisk tree. He was released from the tree, dying
again and then being re-born, and a pillar of wood with four crossed
branches - the Djed column - was raised upright as the sign of his life
everlasting.
Adonis (the name Adonai means the Lord) was born from the myrtle, and
anemones rose from his blood; Dionysos was dismembered as the grapes from
the vine, wreathed in the ivy that is ever-green. Phrygian Attis was tied to
a tree of pine. Even the Buddha attained his supreme awakening as he sat in
meditation beneath the Bodhi tree.
Originally, the symbolism of the cross was a not a solar but a lunar image,
inscribed on neolithic pots as the four quarters of the moon, our first
source of measurement - an image of change and changelessness, time and
eternity.
Transferred to the earth and the solar year, the four points of the lunar
circle become the four directions of the universe, the four cardinal points
of the zodiac (the equinoxes and solstices), the four seasons of the
temperate climates, even the four phases of the day. In other words, an
image of totality in time. Symbolically, the cyclical waxing and waning of
the moon's light offered an image of transformation, for in its perpetual
return to its own beginnings it unified what apparently had been
dismembered. The moon 'died' and yet rose again out of the dark.
All over the world, and throughout a host of cultures, gods, goddesses,
heroes and heroines 'died' during the three days when the moon vanishes.
They went down into the underworld (like Inanna of Sumeria), or into the
belly of the whale or of the dragon (like Jonah in the Old Testament, Jason
of the Greeks, Raven of the Eskimos), or were, like Joseph, thrown into the
well.
Then, they were reborn: Persephone returned to her Harvest Mother, Demeter;
Inanna, naked in death but sprinkled with water, put back her seven veils
and ascended to the upper world. And Jesus, of course, also descended into
hell for three days before his resurrection.
Many, if not most, of the world's religious calendars are lunar in origin
and, for Christians, the drama of the moon's cyclical phases remains
reflected in the timing of Easter to the first Sunday after the first full
moon following the spring equinox.
Significantly, the rites of Christ's incarnation are governed by the solar
calendar and fall on fixed dates, since they are connected with the birth of
the sun (Christmas at the winter solstice, for instance, where Jesus takes
over the role of Sol Invictus from the Roman god Mithras). By contrast, the
Easter rites of his death, resurrection and ascension are governed by the
lunar calendar, because of the images of death and rebirth in the waning and
waxing of the moon.
Easter was named in the middle ages after the Saxon goddess of the dawn,
Eostre, whose feast was held at the spring equinox. Her sacred animal was
the egg-laying moon-hare, which gives us our Easter eggs. So, the underlying
language directs us continually to images of rebirth - the birth of the sun
from the dark of the night, the ascendancy of the light of the new year over
the darkness of the old, and the full moon as the sign of the resurgence of
life over death. And, finally, the cross is transformed from the Tree of
Death into the Tree of Life at the time when all nature buds from an
invisible source.
Perhaps the drawing of parallels, in symbol and ritual, between Christianity
and other mythologies might not have to be greeted, so many centuries later,
with cries of outrage and apostasy from the literalists. Christian theology
is, understandably, committed to the premise that earlier rituals were only
anticipations of the coming of Christ who was their apotheosis. Inevitably
it interprets other traditions in this light.
But the Christian Mystery need not be reduced merely by virtue of its
resemblance to other Mystery religions. Why need its participation with
other traditions in a common store of wonder and worship diminish its own
unique reality? Could it not rather be met with delight - even awe - that so
many of the world's people, have experienced the divine in a similar way?
When, for instance, Mary Magdalene first saw the risen Jesus, she took him
for the gardener - an image that would have been familiar to Mesopotamians,
for whom Dumuzi-Tammuz was known as the gardener in the garden of life.
When Mary, the mother, and Mary Magdalene are shown sorrowing on either side
of the cross, they can be compared with the sisters mourning Osiris. And, as
the Djed column was raised in ancient Egypt after the Nile's life-giving
inundation, the people cried 'Osiris is risen' just as, tomorrow, we
proclaim: 'Christ is risen.'
Why, though, should either festival be lessened by comparison with the
other? And, more than this, might not our own celebration - with our
advantage of the knowledge of both - be enlarged by an awareness of the
other? Not least on the ground that one way of loving our neighbours is to
include their humanity within our own?
