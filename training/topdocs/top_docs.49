   Your Aug. 9 Asides "ACLU Defends Satanism" states that a coven of witches in Rhode Island was able, via the assistance of the ACLU, to obtain tax status as a legitimate religious body. 
This obviously piqued your editorial ire. 
If you had bothered to do your research, you would know that witchcraft (also known as Wicca) is recognized by, among others, the U.S. armed forces as a legitimate religious practice. 
You would also have been able to tell your readers that Wicca far predates the advent of Christianity and therefore has nothing to do with either God or Satan.

   Witchcraft, which can be positive or negative, has little or no similarity to Satanism, except that they both deal with the unseen world. 
Such ignorance unleashed the Salem witch hunts three centuries ago. 
Incidentally, the Rhode Island tax ruling was certainly a correct one. 

   Rev. Douglas Scripture Boggs 

   Christian Light Metaphysical Ministries 

   Bloomington, Ind. 

   ---

   In your haste to discredit the ACLU you have played fast and loose with the facts on witchcraft. 
Witchcraft is not Satanism. 
This sad attribution was begun by the Roman Catholic witch hunters in the Middle Ages; relying on these sources is like relying on Nazis for insights on Jewish culture. 

   Witches and their covens are nothing more, and nothing less, than the remnants of the great, pre-Christian pagan religion of Europe and the Near East. 
Rather than worship a male god, witches revere the Great Goddess, an all-encompassing figure who appears even today in popular culture as Mother Nature or Mother Earth. 
Despite the lack of a bureaucracy, hierarchical priesthood or massive buildings, witchcraft assuredly falls under any definition of religion, precisely the point the ACLU was trying to make. 

   Richard Craig

   ---

   Satanism is a Judeo-Christian religion; Wicca is not. 
Satanism glorifies evil and can exist only in opposition to Christ and the Judeo-Christian god. 
Wicca is in opposition to no religion except Satanism, but only because Wicca opposes all manifestations of evil. 
Wicca is a religion of healing and nurturing. 

   I have never known a witch or a coven that believed in Satan. 
Satan is from an entirely different (and to us, recently developed) religion, and we deny his existence. 

   Morgan Greylock 

   Belleville, Ill. 

   ---

   You perpetuate the tendency for Christians to regard those who worship something different from their own God as uncivilized followers of the devil, and ready for conversion to what you might consider a real, tax-deductible religion. 
But witchcraft and other "pagan" religions began long before Christianity. 

   Just because witchcraft isn't as popular as Christianity doesn't mean its churches shouldn't be given the same rights and benefits of Christian churches -- every church is protected under the First Amendment's guarantees of religious freedom. 
We can't have laws favoring one religion while repressing others, otherwise we're doomed to return to the days of witch burnings and concentration camps.

<HL> Real Witches Today Don't Stew Newts, Not in Wisconsin --- Selena Fox's Coven Prefers Baked Lasagna, and Rites Show Ecological Fervor </HL>
<AUTHOR> Scott McMurray (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> BRIGHAM TOWNSHIP, Wis.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cloaked in a brown woolen poncho and cap, Selena Fox stands in the center of a stone circle. 
Gray clouds bear down on the hilltop site, threatening rain. 
A chill wind howls through the woods here behind her farmhouse. 
Arms raised, she and her audience of three shake gourd rattles and chant exhortations to the elements -- earth, air, fire and water. 

   Tonight the moon will be full. 
Now it's the witching hour. 
Ms. Fox is the witch. 
The audience -- except for me -- is her coven. 
And this is witchcraft, circa 1988. 

   "May humankind stop polluting the waters and may all ocean dumping stop," she prays to the west wind. 

   Witching has come a long way since Shakespeare's crones cackled of evil deeds and wagged their gnarled fingers at Macbeth. 
Ms. Fox, 39 years old, is a high priestess of the new witchery, known to its familiars as the wiccan religion -- wiccan being an ancient word for witchcraft. 

   Its following of 100,000 people, male and female, includes bankers and a tugboat captain; a survey of the faithful showed that computer-company employees make up the biggest single occupational group. 

   Most of these witches are still in the broom closet. 
Now as ever, a witch's lot is not a happy one. 
Witches face firing and housing discrimination, and only on Halloween can they act like others in public. 

   Ms. Fox and her husband and fellow witch, Dennis Carpenter, bought their 200 acres here after their landlord evicted them for being witches five years ago. 
Ms. Fox won't give the names of her coven members, except for her husband and her assistant, to ensure their privacy. 

   Like other religionists, Ms. Fox complains of apathy among her flock. 
"A lot of Christians only go to church on Christmas and Easter," she says, "and a lot of pagans only come out on Halloween." 

   Halloween, on the wiccan calendar, is also New Year's Eve, following Celtic tradition. 
Doctrinaire covens, such as Samantha River's Reformed Congregation of the Goddess in nearby Madison, hold that this Halloween is New Year's Eve of the year 9988. 
The year one of this calendar supposedly began at the dawn of agriculture. 
Ms. River, whose witch-name is Jade, claims about 125 members, all of them women. 
"Sorry," she says, "no men allowed." 

   Ms. Fox is one of the few witches with a public presence. 
She speaks at colleges and elsewhere, explaining that witchcraft is pre-Christian nature religion, not Satanism or black magic. 
She even addressed a World Council of Churches meeting on spirituality last summer. 

   "We're white witches. 
Think of Glenda, the good witch of the North in the Wizard of Oz," she tells audiences. 
Her coven, Circle Sanctuary, publishes a quarterly newspaper and maintains a legal nonprofit status. 

   Ms. Fox recently updated the chapter on witchcraft in the Army chaplain's handbook. 
Among other things, it tells chaplains that wiccans prefer cremation -- oddly enough, in the light of history. 

   Frank Medina, a Beloit policeman who serves on a state committee on cults and gangs, says, "I've gone to her rituals to see what's going on. 
They are a very open, almost childlike group. 
The problem is, people see witchcraft, Satanism and the occult as all the same thing." 

   "Selena runs the prime networking organization in the craft," says Margot Adler, a wiccan high priestess, National Public Radio reporter and author of "Drawing Down the Moon" -- the bible, so to speak, of contemporary witchcraft. 

   Last June, Ms. Fox performed a legal wedding ceremony on Martha's Vineyard for Ms. Adler and her groom. 
They didn't call it a wedding; in witch circles it is known as a "handfasting." 
This is believed to be the first to make the society pages of the New York Times. 
The handfasters jumped over a broom for good luck. 

   Otherwise, wiccans seem pretty ordinary. 
They were raised in more conventional religions -- Ms. Fox as a Baptist -- and discovered witchcraft on their own. 
As a child, she had several "mystical experiences," and beginning in graduate school served several apprenticeships under wiccan priestesses. 
She is a practicing psychotherapist as well as a priestess. 

   In addition to moon rituals, wiccans celebrate pagan seasonal holidays, some of which correspond to more modern innovations. 
The winter and summer solstices are both observed. 
So are ground hog's day, the mid-point of winter; May day, for fertility and planting; an August crop festival and, of course, Halloween. 

   Circle Sanctuary celebrates Halloween in two parts. 
The first is a private ceremony to remember and honor the recent dead. 
Occurring as plants die back in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, the holiday is a "thin time," when the living draw closest to the dead. 
Members also make the equivalent of New Year's resolutions for better lives in the year ahead. 

   High purpose concluded, witches begin the fun in the second part, a harvest and "samhain" -- Celtic for New Year's -- festival. 
It started in pre-Christian Europe with the leaving of treats on platters for dead relatives. 
Families too stingy to leave treats risked being haunted, or tricked, by the disappointed spirits, Ms. Fox says. 
Circle Sanctuary's wiccans attend a come-as-you-were party dressed as they think they dressed in a previous life, or as they dress in fantasy. 
This year Ms. Fox may get herself up as Lady Liberty to express her commitment to freedom of religion. 

   There will be a potluck dinner. 
No strange stews, mind you. 
"The dishes at wiccan dinners tend more toward baked lasagna than eye-of-newt soup," says Charlene Suggs, Ms. Fox's assistant. 

   The group performs rituals for special occasions. 
Circle Sanctuary did its part to fight the drought last summer with dancing and chanting. 
Coincidence perhaps, but within 48 hours, Ms. Fox says, it rained here. 
Then there was a ritual to help end the recent fires in Yellowstone National Park. 
"Maybe it was a coincidence, but they had their first snowfall the next day," Ms. Suggs says. 

   Theodore Arneson, chairman of the nearby Barneveld State Bank, negotiated the contract for the purchase of the farm by Ms. Fox and her husband. 
"She told me they were witches up front. 
I have no misgivings whatsoever," he says. 

   Mr. Arneson recalls that when a tornado devastated the nearby village of Barneveld in 1984, "she was up there in her Red Cross uniform the next day serving soup. 
She is a remarkable person in my opinion." 

   Others hereabouts seem bothered and bewildered. 
Shortly after moving onto the farm, Ms. Fox and Mr. Carpenter started improving their barn. 
Then they were told by zoning officials that they needed a zoning variance. 
Two days before a public hearing on the variance, a local fundamentalist church held a meeting and showed a movie about Satanism and the occult, with warnings about the evils of witchcraft. 

   At the hearing, a crowd jeered at the wiccans and grilled them about their religion for several hours. 
On both sides, the hearing quickly became known as the "Barneveld witch hunt." 

   For the past two years, the American Civil Liberties Union, citing freedom of religion concerns, has provided Ms. Fox with free legal services in the zoning dispute, which still isn't resolved. 

   Ms. Fox's farm straddles hills that were bypassed by glaciers in the Ice Age. 
Craggy rock formations held spiritual powers, according to Indian tribes that once roamed the area. 
Scandinavian settlers also felt the vibes. 
The village of nearby Mount Horeb is dotted with troll statues that harken to pre-Christian Northern Europe. 

   Ms. Fox says that on her first tour of the farm she was drawn straight up the hill to the site where her coven is constructing its stone circle. 
At each meeting the coven adds to the circle, about 40 feet in diameter and less than a foot high. 
Especially on the west, or "water" side, seashells lie in the rocks. 
North represents the earth, east the wind and fire the south, to round out the wiccan compass. 

   At the site, we join hands and rotate clockwise, chanting, "We are a circle, within a circle, with no beginning, and never ending." 
The coven blesses rocks and adds them to the pile, and the chant continues: "We are stewards of the land, we are healers." 

   A half-hour after the rites conclude, the sky clears and the sun comes out, as if by our summons. 

   Probably it is a coincidence.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To hear some of them tell it, there are more
witches in North America than you can shake a broom at. One of them
is an American who emigrated to Canada, a high priest of Wicca who
is campaigning for witches' rights. Among other things, he wants a
license to perform weddings.

   He's a Vietnam veteran who spends quiet evenings
watching Cary Grant movies and would like to be reincarnated as
Fred Astaire.
   But Charles Arnold is also Canada's most visible witch, a
second-degree high priest of Wicca, the religion of witchcraft.
   ``I don't melt if water is poured over me,'' says the
40-year-old clerical worker who is campaigning for legal acceptance
of his beliefs in both a male and female divinity, the potency of
magic and absence of original sin.
   Arnold began the quest last year when he asked his boss for paid
religious leave on the Wiccan holidays of ``Samhain,'' Nov. 1, when
witches celebrate the mortality of the body and immortality of the
soul, and ``Belthane,'' May 1, welcoming summer, life and fertility.
   Humber College of Applied Arts and Technology, which employs
Arnold in its hospitality office, denied his request because Wicca
is not recognized by the Canadian Council of Churches and lacks
tax-free charitable status.
   Arnold protested to a labor arbitration board which upheld his
grievance and said: ``Wicca is obviously a religion...the modern
survival of the ancient pagan religions of Western Europe.''
   But Arnold's victory was short-lived.
   The native of Washington, D.C., who served a year in Vietnam,
became an anti-war activist and emigrated to Canada 15 years ago,
had also applied for a license to become the first Canadian witch
authorized to perform weddings.
   In a March ruling, the Ontario registrar-general's office turned
him down. It questioned the legitimacy of his ordination and the
nature of the Wiccan marriage ritual, known as a ``handfasting.''
   Arnold blamed Ontario's Protestant establishment, although
Council of Churches official Edith Shore showed some sympathy for
the Wiccans. ``Christianity was a fringe group when it started,
too,'' she said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Arnold complained that the Marriage Act discriminates against
Canada's 5,000 witches by making it a crime, punishable by up to
six months in jail, to perform an unauthorized wedding.
   ``They should either license me or do away with the law
altogether,'' he said, noting that Wiccan weddings are permitted in
38 U.S. states. He had to travel to Montpelier, Vt., for his own
Wiccan wedding three years ago.
   The practice of witchcraft is fairly widespread in the United
States, but precise numbers are hard to come by.
   ``It's everywhere, every big city probably has a group,'' says
the Rev. W. M. Kent Burtner, a Dominican priest based in Portland,
Ore., who studies cults. ``I see it basically as a nature religion
not associated with Satanism, but that may be skewed because of
whom I get to meet as a Catholic priest. It's a write-your-own
theology sort of a approach and it runs a real broad spectrum.''
   Lady Sabrina, a high priestess in Nashua, N.H., estimates there
are ``a couple of hundred thousand'' members scattered across the
United States, including ``a couple of thousand'' high priests and
priestesses.
   Starhawk, a San Francisco high priestess and author of ``The
Spiral Dance,'' a book about Wicca, largely agrees.
   ``I just had a conversation with someone and we decided that
there were between 250,000 and 4 million of us,'' she says. The 4
million, she explains, would include all pagans.
   ``In any case,'' she says, ``there are more of us than there are
Unitarians.''
   Starhawk says many members are underground.
   ``There is a long tradition where it is not safe to be a
witch,'' she says. ``We don't necessarily announce it. Many
people's jobs would be in jeopardy.''
   Starhawk, an author and lecturer, teaches at a Catholic college
in Oakland, Calif. Her most recent book is ``Truth or Dare
Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery.''
   Lady Sabrina runs Our Lady of Enchantment, a Wicca mail order
school with 6,000 members representing 25 countries.

Witches in Rhode Island -- which was founded as a haven for religious 
dissenters -- hope that they, too, will gain public acceptance now that the 
state has recognized their sect as a legitimate religious group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Rosegate Coven want outsiders to see them as followers of a 
faith, not freaks who ride brooms and cast spells. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in a kitchen adorned with skulls, pictures of sorcerers, 
the obligatory broom and a humorous kitchen-witch, the members talked about 
their attempts to sensitize others to their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to combat centuries of conditioning. People have been conditioned by 
their religion . . . and society to ridicule us, not to take anything seriously 
that the Christian religion doesn't put forth," said the coven's high 
priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also known as Lady Genevieve. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't easily give up their misconceptions -- they really enjoy them," 
said Siegrist, 46, who is also director of the New England chapter of the 
Witches' Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last October, the group, which has about 40 members, decided to 
incorporate as a nonprofit religious group and apply for exemption from the 
Rhode Island sales tax. Recently, the state tax administrator reversed an 
earlier decision and approved the request. 
</P>
<P>
The framed exemption certificate hangs in the modest kitchen near an enlarged 
photograph showing the Rosegate "grove," the overall group of about 40 
initiates. The coven, or inner core of leaders, consists of about a dozen 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the intent wasn't to save the 6% sales tax," said Julian Bradford, 
who handles Rosegate's public relations. "It was to obtain the legitimization." 
</P>
<P>
The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church, decided to come 
out of the closet in part because of recent publicity about Satanists. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lumped with them for 800 years. It makes us stand up and say 
'enough is enough!' " Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
To believe in Satan, one first must believe in the Judeo-Christian tradition, 
Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wiccans believe in a deity with both male and female attributes, whose 
psychic energy can be tapped by anyone. Rosegate, a Wiccan sect, emphasizes 
metaphysics rather than simple magic, and does not use many of the props often 
associated with witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"In our tradition we are trying to eradicate needless superstition," said 
Siegrist. She cited as an example the use of crystal balls. "The ball doesn't 
have diddly. The power comes from within." 
</P>
<P>
From Siegrist's kitchen office, equipped with a copying machine, the coven puts 
out a newsletter eight times a year, keeps track of its 75-subscriber mailing 
list, arranges witchcraft classes and plans meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The group has a small building fund and hopes someday to open a center, 
complete with sanctuary and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Rosegate suffers little harassment overall, said Siegrist. A crank caller who 
repeatedly phoned during the interview was "really the first crank I've ever 
had to put up with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But "the mockery is always going to exist," said Bradford. "We're the victims 
of eight or nine centuries of bad press." 
</P>
<P>
When hostility surfaces, "we try our best not to return it," Siegrist said. 
</P>
<P>
The witches profess to be uninhibited about their beliefs but appear to be held 
back by their traditional upbringings. 
</P>
<P>
Sanura, 49, the secretary and musician of the group, said she has told only one 
relative that she is a witch. "Those Irish Catholics would disown me for sure." 
She would not give her Christian name. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford, who fought in Vietnam and has a "Mother" tattoo on his forearm, said: 
"We're very open about what we are because we have nothing to hide. We welcome 
the opportunity to educate others." 
</P>
<P>
He said others are accepting when they learn he is a witch. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy made broom jokes at work until he had a problem I worked out with a 
little magic," he said. Bradford, who works at an East Providence car 
dealership, would not elaborate on the problem or his solution, other than to 
say there was "no hocus-pocus, simply the application of proven metaphysical 
principles." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the coven has proved that it is legitimate, at least in the eyes of 
Rhode Island's division of taxation, what does it want now? 
</P>
<P>
"Give us a corporate broom to fly us to the Bahamas," Bradford said.

   A coven of witches in Rhode Island _ the

will gain public acceptance now that the state has declared them a

   Cheryl St. John doesn't cast evil spells.
She'd rather bake chocolate raisin bread than stir eye of newt and
toe of frog into a bubbling cauldron. And she carries her
broomstick in the trunk of her suburban sedan.
   ``I'm a good witch, but bad witches have more fun,'' she says
with a mischievous wink.
   By day, she's a 37-year-old computer programmer who dresses for
corporate success. By night, she's Lady Cassandra, the black-clad
high priestess of three covens of metropolitan Washington D.C.
witches who worship an ancient goddess of fertility.
   She's also a shaman, ``a sort of traveling chaplain'' who visits
divorcees, drug addicts, cancer patients and other witches who need
the healing hand of a spiritual companion in their time of
suffering.
   She takes along a canvas gym bag stuffed with the tools for a
portable altar _ a goddess image, chalices, incense, candles,
broom, hand-carved wand and a beribboned sword, her badge of
witching authority.
   The broom, incidentally, is not for riding the skies under a
full moon. The bride and groom jump over it for good luck at
witches' weddings, or ``handfastings.'' Following centuries-old
tradition, Ms. St. John uses her broom to make sure the altar's
``magic circle'' is swept clean of evil thoughts.
   ``I'm everything the pastor in your local church would be,'' she
says. ``I marry 'em and I bury 'em. I specialize in healing the
heart. I let the doctors work with potions, and I work with the
soul.''
   Her followers gather regularly around a coffee table altar in
Ms. St. John's townhouse in this Washington suburb for an evening
of meditation, worship and study of the Wiccan religion, a
nature-loving pagan faith with roots in ancient Western Europe.
   Her branch of the Wiccan tradition celebrates the feminine
virtues of life-giving, nurturing and respect for the environment,
with true equality of the sexes. She traces its origins to the
pre-Christian Celtic isles.
   ``We are the snakes that St. Patrick chased out of Ireland,''
says Ms. St. John, who regards snakes as holy.
   Eight times a year, her witches join hundreds of others in
forested parks or rented hotel ballrooms to celebrate seasonal
holidays on the Wiccan calendar with festivals of dancing, singing
and storytelling. The most joyful event, naturally, is Halloween,
which marks the Wiccan new year.
   Ms. St. John, a psychic who entered the witchhood eight years
ago, estimates there are 1,000 or more witches or serious students
of witchcraft in the Washington area, and perhaps 20,000 or more
throughout the United States. Other estimates range as high as
100,000, but nobody knows for sure.
   Most witches have stayed in the broom closet, fearful of job
losses, evictions, social ostracism and the vengeful wrath of
fundamentalist preachers if they're found out.
   Ms. St. John decided to go public when she became outraged over
accusations that witches practice devil worship and black magic, or
that they boil babies to obtain the fat for making altar candles.
   ``Most of our people use magic to heal themselves and bring what
we need into our lives,'' she said. ``There are a lot of wackos out
there, but we're as ethical a bunch of people as you're ever going
to meet. Our basic law is `do as you will, but harm none.'''
   It's not all toil and trouble, however.
   She may be a good witch, but Ms. St. John occasionally uses her
magical powers for some innocent fun.
   ``I use it to get parking places,'' she said. ``When my friends
and I go out to eat, I will visualize the restaurant in my mind and
visualize a parking space close by. When we drive up, it's there.
   ``You make it happen in your mind, and it happens,'' she said.
``That's what magic is all about.''

<HEAD>Witch Coven Wins Tax Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Witchcraft is a legitimate religion and
its churches, or covens, are entitled to the same tax breaks as
those of more established religions, the state division of taxation
has ruled.
   ``With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come
out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said Joyce
Siegrist, 45, high priestess of Rosegate Coven. She said the coven
has a core group of 11 members and 30 to 40 initiates.
   The ruling announced today by Tax Administrator R. Gary Clark
overturned an earlier decision that said the coven did not meet
criteria for being a church.
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
will no longer have to pay state sales tax for supplies.
   ``This decision demonstrates that, with a properly presented
case, even unusual or small religious groups can be treated equally
with more mainstream religions by the state,'' said A. Gregory
Frazier, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who announced the
decision. He represented the witches in an administrative hearing
in May.
   Hearing officer Sandra J. Murphy, who recommended that Clark
grant the exemption, ruled July 20 that the coven fulfilled most of
the state Supreme Court's criteria for determining the legitimacy
of a religion.
   The Wiccans are a nonprofit group, not set up for the purpose of
avoiding taxes, and have a litany or system of prayer, as well as
specific doctrines and practices that all members of the coven were
expected to follow, Murphy ruled.
   Last fall, when the tax exemption was denied, the division's
questions indicated that officials were focusing on the apparent
lack of formal theology schools for training wiccan clergy, and
also on their willingness to allow members to belong to other
churches, Frazier said.
   The latter argument was rebutted when the Rev. Thomas Ahlburn,
senior minister of the First Unitarian Church of Providence,
testified that his church and many Eastern religions also permit
their members to belong to other faiths, Frazier said.

   A coven of witches has won tax exempt
status in Rhode Island as a legitimate religious group.
   ``With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come
out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said the coven's
high priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also known as Lady Genevieve.
   Tax Administrator R. Gary Clark said he overturned the state's
initial ruling, that the Rosegate Coven did not qualify for a sales
tax exemption, because it proved on appeal that it met the
guidelines for legitimate church groups as set out by a 1986 Rhode
Island Supreme Court ruling.
   Administrative Hearing Officer Sandra Murphy said Tuesday that
she heard about 2{ hours of testimony in May and undertook
extensive research on her own before recommending the action that
Clark took on July 28.
   ``I'm happy that anyone who is practicing a religion in earnest
is able to do so without state impediment,'' she said.
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
has 30 to 40 members in Rhode Island and meets approximately three
times a month for rituals, said Siegrist.
   The core of the Wiccan worship is belief in a diety with male
and female attributes, whose psychic energy can be tapped. Although
the power can be used for good or ill will, witches do not use it
for destructive purposes.
   When the tax exemption was denied last fall, the division's
questions indicated tax officials were focusing on the apparent
lack of formal theology schools for training Wiccan clergy, said A.
Gregory Frazier, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represented the witches in the administrative hearing in May.
   He said officials also questioned the group's willingness to
allow members to belong to other churches while claiming coven
membership.
   That argument was rebutted when the Rev. Thomas Ahlburn, senior
minister of the First Unitarian Church of Providence, testified
that his church and many Eastern religions also permit members to
belong to other faiths, Frazier said.
   Under state laws, a religion must be a nonprofit group, not set
up for the purpose of avoiding taxes. It must have a litany or
system of prayer, as well as specific doctrines and practices that
its members are expected to follow.
   Clark said the connotation of ``witches'' may have made it more
difficult for the state.
   ``If all the facts were identical and they were not called
witches but were called brothers and sisters, for example, it
probably would not have been anywhere nearly so'' controversial, he
said.
   Murphy said she didn't think the decision would set a precedent.
   ``This was very logical, very straightforward and very
unemotional,'' she said, noting the coven is empowered by the state
to officiate over marriage and burials.

   ``I have performed marriages and have tax-exempt status, but I
only know 12 or 15 others who have tax exempt-status,'' she says.
``You really have to fight to get it.''
   ``Many of us in California perform marriages, but here if you go
through the trouble to sign the papers and take a blood test, you
can get licensed to perform marriages,'' Starhawk says. ``A dog
could get the license here.''
   Lady Sabrina, whose church is open to the public on Friday
nights, says she never heard of Charles Arnold, but that does not
surprise her.
   ``For a while a woman in Salem, Mass., who was picketing the
movie `Witches of Eastwick' became very well known. Since there is
no central organization, whoever makes the most noise becomes the
most prominent witch.''
   Arnold, a soft-spokeman man with a beard, says he was initiated
as a priest in witchcraft traditions dating back thousands of years.
   Each coven, grove or temple chooses its own rituals and vows.
Some covens meet in the nude, but Arnold's group prefers robes.
   He offered this description of a Wiccan wedding:
   Inside a magical circle, the male and female divinities are
summoned along with the guardians of the four elements _ air,
water, fire and earth.
   The groom's left hand is bound to the bride's right hand and
some choose to draw blood from their skin and touch like blood
brothers.
   Couples exchange rings, bracelets or floral crowns; step over
flames for purification and fertility, and jump over a broom to
symbolize household unity.
   Traditional gifts include bread (for plenty), silver
(prosperity), salt (health) and wood or coal (physical and
emotional warmth).
   Before the priest pronounces them husband and wife, he invokes
the couple ``to pleasure one another,'' Arnold says. ``We don't cut
sex off from the rest of life. We don't make a big thing out of it
either.''
   At the heart of the primitive religion lies the power of the
male and female in nature, symbolized by the god usually referred
to by the Celtic name Herne, and the goddess known as Cerridwen or
Athena or Isis, Arnold said.
   Wiccans also believe in the mysteries of magic, reincarnation
and in celebrating the rites of passage, such as first menstruation
and menopause.
   ``We go through life after life to learn and evolve and progress
to the point where we rejoin the god and goddess,'' Arnold says.
``Behind them, there is something we can't even identify, the unity
they come from.''
   Witches don't go around laying curses on people, and they don't
conduct human or animal sacrifices, eat babies or worship the devil
as depicted in folklore and comics, he said.
   But the craft does have a practical side.
   ``I mix up potions and my wife makes some of the finest liqueurs
you've ever tasted,'' Arnold says. ``I use wormwood and calendula
(a rare herb) in vinegar to take bruises away and lavender vinegar
for sunburn.''
   Arnold says he discovered his religion 10 years ago after
intuitively constructing a Wiccan altar in his home. A woman he was
dating happened to be a witch and was startled to see the altar.
   Leader of the 50-member Temple of the Elder Faiths in Toronto,
Arnold was raised in New Jersey by a grandmother who read tea
leaves.
   ``We believe that if you are meant to find the craft, you
will,'' he says. ``Many traditional Wiccans think we're growing too
fast and this will water down the religion and may actually destroy
it.''
   He said covens usually meet on eight sabbaths coinciding with
the year's solar and lunar cycles. The average age in his group is
27 and members include a real estate agent, a schoolteacher and a
naturopath.
   ``Covens are closer than most families. Members tend to be more
imaginative than most people and a little bit eccentric,'' said
Arnold, a published poet and expert on ritual body decoration.

<TEXT>     According to the witches, some of the police drew their service pistols
when they saw Bertram, the high priest of Minnesota's 100 or so practitioners
of Wiccan witchcraft, making gestures with his ceremonial dagger, actually an
ornate letter-opener.;    One of the dozen officers who came to investigate
the ceremony allegedly ridiculed the witches, accusing them of being
satanists.;    Hilary Pell, 35, a priestess of the Minnesota Church of Wicca,
said she was asked by an officer, "Do you worship the devil?";    She said she
told them she did not since Satan is a Christian concept. She said the Wicca
religion, which is derived from ancient pagan beliefs, focuses on the care of
the earth.;    Police spokesman Paul Adelmann insisted the problem "had
nothing to do with religion." He said the witches had a gallon jug of wine
(which is against park law), that the ceremonial daggers could be easily
construed as weapons in a dark wooded area and that some of the witches were
trying to control access in the fire ring area.;    Later, after some witches
lodged a complaint, Police Sgt. Vern Lee, occult crimes expert in the police
special investigations unit, and high priest Bertram (actually Philip Flom),
met over coffee and sought to patch up the misunderstanding.;    Lee said he
could appreciate the Wiccans' outrage. "I belong to a Masonic lodge and the
Shrine," he said. "You don't walk into those meetings."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Service Allows Witch To Observe Religious Holidays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force physical therapist who says she
is a witch has been given permission to observe eight holidays in
her faith, including All Hallow's Eve.
   Airman Patricia Hutchins, 21, who says she has been a wiccan, or
witch, for four years, asked the Air Force to allow her to take
time off from Lackland Air Force Base for religious holidays, just
as it does members of other religions.
   Witches generally believe that the sun, moon, earth and all life
are divine and are personifications of all creative energy.
   Base spokesman Bob MacNaughton said Lackland's chaplain, Col.
David Engler, wrote a letter to Ms. Hutchins' supervising officers
at Wilford Hall Medical Center, asking that they follow Air Force
regulations on religious freedom.
   MacNaughton said an Air Force regulation on accommodating
religious practices states: ``Members of the Air Force are free to
express religious beliefs in a manner that is consistent and fair
to all.''
   Ms. Hutchins said she was surprised by the chaplain's expedient
help.
   ``I have found that chaplains in the Air Force are very
open-minded,'' said Ms. Hutchins. ``I was surprised they did it,
but I'm very grateful.''
   Ms. Hutchins also will be allowed to observe days marking the
changes of the seasons.
   ``As far as we're concerned, wicca is not a hostile type of
faith,'' said MacNaughton. ``Her being a witch has not presented
any problems for her in her working place or anywhere else.''
   Among the days she'll be allowed to observe are All Hallows Eve,
Oct. 31, and days marking the changes of the seasons. Hutchins
traces her faith to Celtic Ireland.
   Ms. Hutchins' husband, who also serves in the Air Force, is not
a wiccan.
   Colleagues and co-workers haven't shunned her for her beliefs,
she said.
   ``Everybody has been really good about it,'' said Ms. Hutchins.
``I work with a lot of officers and they seem to be very
open-minded and have at least read about wiccans.''
   The daughter of a Protestant minister, Ms. Hutchins said she
doesn't know of any others in the Air Force who practice witchcraft.

'NEARER MY GODDESS TO THEE' MAY BECOME THE
CLARION CALL OF FEMINISM FOR THE '90S -- NEW
AGE, PAGAN OR TRADITIONAL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Spirituality  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If the events of the past few months are any indication, women are looking
for a spiritual connection -- for a way to push the boundaries of their
religious experience beyond the ordinary confines of traditional
Judeo-Christian monotheism.;    Consciousness-raising may have been the solace
of the '70s and career development the icon of the '80s, but the '90s offer a
very different option -- the spirit.;    Today's seekers, after all, are the
daughters of the feminist revolution. Not for them the victimized heroines and
saints of the past, or the patriarchal structure of the male-dominated
religions of the Old and New Testaments.;    Their touchstones are the pagan
religions, the pre-Christian earth-centered goddess cults that stress the
harmony of the universe -- offering equality rather than hierarchy, peace
rather than war, joy rather than guilt, ritual rather than rote.;    "It's
religion without the middleman -- including sex and drugs," says Margot Adler,
a journalist at National Public Radio and the author of "Drawing Down the
Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshipers and Other Pagans in America Today.";
   Practitioners estimate that the women's spirituality movement has as many
as 500,000 followers across the country.;    Whether mainstream, new age,
goddess-oriented (a point of view expressing a female- and earth-centered
style of worship rather than a specific body of liturgy) or wiccan (a mainly
British Isles paganism named from the Old English word for witch), today's
celebrants are as varied as they are hard to count.;    "It's definitely
growing, but you'll never get hard figures," says Adler, whose book was
originally published in 1979 and, with more than 100,000 in print, still sells
more than 10,000 a year. "A group of women can start a group and not tell
anybody, and you'll have a thriving group doing rituals and who will know?";  
 What can be traced is the flourishing book industry, mostly out of San
Francisco, that the movement has spawned. Two books published in 1979 --
Adler's and "The Spiral Dance," a more personal vision by the San
Francisco-based priestess known as Starhawk -- have been particularly
influential.;    Several threads are woven through the burgeoning movement: a
dissatisfaction with the way women are treated within traditional religions, a
yearning for ritual, a desire for a historical connection, despair over the
fragmentation of society and concern about the future of the planet.;    Says
Diana Hayes, professor of theology at Georgetown University: "Within
Christianity, theology and spirituality have been male-oriented,
male-dominated, because they are the ones articulating it. But we all are
affected by who we are, where we came from, our life experience, our
relationship with God.;    "So the challenge has been to get this realization
out in the open and to have the men who dominate theological circles realize
that they cannot speak for the rest of the human race. Women do not think or
act the way men do. Therefore our spirituality will not be the same as
men's.";    A gifted speaker with an easy sense of humor, Starhawk --
priestess of the Old Religion of the Goddess and women's spirituality
superstar -- is equally at home beating time in the center of a ritual or
working the crowd at the podium of a lecture hall.;    Early interest in
witchcraft;    She also at home with what she calls the "W" word ("witch").
"Unless we understand it, we don't know why a powerful woman is so threatening
and so frightening," she says. "There was a 400-year reign of terror
particularly directed against women who were then burned alive," she says,
likening the witch hunts to the African slave trade, the Holocaust.;   
Starhawk became interested in witchcraft in her late teens when she and a
friend did a student seminar on the subject at UCLA. Now she is at the
forefront of a movement to reclaim the word for positive use.;    The picture
of witchcraft that emerges within today's women's spirituality movement is a
combination of group therapy, positive thinking, stretching exercises, guided
visualization, song and dance, and even pot luck.;    Its goddess- and
nature-oriented precepts are similar to the Old Religion of prehistoric times
and societies that fell victim to the witch hunts and persecutions of medieval
and Renaissance Europe. It is earth-centered, individualistic and
peace-loving.;    Leading a group of women in Philadelphia through a series of
activities, the 40ish Starhawk looks not unlike the tall Jewish girl from Los
Angeles she used to be. But her soft-voiced, authoritative presence and
staccato chanting and drumming command her sessions with surprising power.;   
Use of chants;  Like many women's ritual leaders, Starhawk uses chants as a
kind of surrogate liturgy -- as a blessing, a uniting force, a backdrop to
movement and dance.;    In a visualization, she takes the group to an
imaginary crossroads in the sky. "Close your eyes," she says. "Reach out and
feel and touch and smell these roads until you find one that feels like a road
in the future. Go down the road. Know you can come back to this place of power
because it is you. And remember there are many roads to the future. The road
you chose is only one possibility.";    Starhawk spends about a third of her
time teaching ritual and spreading the faith at college campuses and other
forums. She feels that people crave it. "Even people who live in cities --
like most of us -- are still connected to the cycles of nature," she says.
"Doing ritual that helps you affirm that helps us not to feel cut off from the
larger life around us, the actual life support systems that sustain our lives."  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  REBORN AGAIN?
ERIC PRYOR, AN EX-PAGAN WHO ONCE RE-ENACTED AN
'EXORCISM' ON TV, NOW AVIDLY PREACHES THE WORD OF
THE PENTECOSTALS AS DOUBTS ABOUT HIS SINCERITY AND
MORALITY ABOUND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     He re-enacted an "exorcism" on Channel 5's "People Are Talking" show -- but
the woman he supposedly freed of demonic beings was actually his live-in
girlfriend. (She called him a "doctor." He isn't.);   Then, after organizing a
1990 "public cursing" of televangelist Larry Lea, he suddenly and inexplicably
converted to born-again Christianity. Now he's selling himself as "the witch
who switched" and finds himself in the middle of a dispute between the pagans
and the Pentecostals.;   He is Eric J. Pryor, age 32, a native of Suffren,
N.Y., who grew up in Woodstock. He has a long criminal record -- something he
willingly admits -- and has reportedly bragged about cheating people out of
their money. "I never said I was a saint," he says.;   He has, indeed, dabbled
in witchcraft for much of his life. But his latest incarnation is that of a
preacher, garbed in Army fatigues, who conducts his "Christian Gladiator
Ministries" out of San Jose's Jubilee Christian Center.;   It was quite a tale
of salvation and spiritual renewal -- a made-for-TV movie, at least -- until
Nov. 21.;   That night, ABC News reporter Diane Sawyer anchored an
investigative report on the network's "PrimeTime Live" exposing fraudulent
televangelists who manipulate their followers into giving them millions of
dollars.;   One of the show's targets was Larry Lea's Texas ministry, and
Sawyer raised serious questions about Pryor's reputed conversion and the TV
preacher's role in it.;   Pryor "was never a major leader of the pagans," she
said, citing his "long arrest record" and contending that the supposed
conversion "was accompanied by wining, dining and money.";   The program also
showed a tape of Pryor seeming to marry Sandra, his girlfriend, with the Rev.
Dick Bernal of the Jubilee Christian Center performing the ceremony -- even
though Pryor was, and still is, married to another woman.;   So, who is this
Eric Pryor? Born-again bigamist? Spiritual con artist? Or a misunderstood
convert to fundamentalism whose enemies are out to get him?;   The latter is
the role Pryor is playing most recently. Sitting in a back room Tuesday
afternoon at the Jubilee Center, a large charismatic church claiming 5,000
congregants, Pryor makes his case. On this day, the tall, gaunt, decidedly
pale Pryor is wearing a sleek suit and tie. His formerly long, bleached-blond
hair is trimmed, neatly combed back and dyed red.;   Efforts 'to shut me up'; 
 "I'm out to expose the fraud in the pagan community," he says, contending
that he is incensed at the accusations. He charges that the network expose
made use of questionable material gathered by Bay Area pagans "to shut me
up.";   Bernal explains the conversion process this way: He met Pryor on that
Halloween 1990 "People Are Talking" show, and their conversation continued at
the hotel coffee shop next door. Then he offered Pryor transportation money.; 
 "Wining, dining and money?" Bernal asks, referring to the ABC expose. "I gave
him coffee, nachos and cab fare.";   The "PrimeTime Live" report also cited a
Herb Caen column in the San Francisco Chronicle saying Pryor made $100,000
last year. Pryor vigorously denies it, maintaining that he's virtually
penniless. His only sources of income, he says, are "love offerings" from the
church and people moved by his preaching -- as well as sales of "From Pagan to
Pentecost," a $25 video version of his purported transformation. He gets $3 in
royalties per sale.;   Pryor also says he spends one day a month passing out
money to homeless people and inviting them to listen as he spreads the word.
"I do this because I've been there and I care," he tells them, "and this is my
way of serving the Lord I call king of my life, Jesus.";    As Pryor is making
his case, Bernal enters the room to offer his total support. At the same time,
however, the minister clearly is taken aback by Pryor's flashy attire,
extravagant jewelry and Rolex watch. "You're supposed to be penniless," Bernal
says with a chuckle, "and you're sitting here dressed like a riverboat
gambler.";   Later, Pryor explains that his watch, gold chains and bejeweled
rings -- some real and some fake -- are all simply more "love offerings.";  
The church has helped Pryor somewhat. It did find him a Santa Clara apartment,
Bernal says, insisting it was necessary to move him out of San Francisco in
response to death threats. Bernal also provides him with a small income --
$500 a month on top of his $600 monthly Social Security check, "but the money
didn't come until after he was converted." (Larry Lea had said on the ABC show
that Pryor was given $1,000 a month; he has since corrected that figure to
$500.);   Explaining the questionable marriage ceremony is a bit trickier,
however.;   Before Pryor and his girlfriend, Sandra, could be accepted into
Bernal's church, they had to get married, says the minister -- but Pryor was
quick to say that his wife, Nicole, had left him and he had no idea if he was
still legally married. On the advice of the church's lawyer, therefore, Bernal
says the ceremony was merely "a little spiritual ceremony, not a civil
ceremony.";   If it appeared more serious than that to ABC viewers, the
minister suggests, it's the fault of women in the church, who let it get out
of hand. Thus the tux, the wedding gown, the flowers and the marriage license
that they appeared to be signing. "My wife and some of the girls got
involved," says Bernal. "They wanted to make it special.";   Bay Area pagans
willingly agree they have been digging up dirt on Pryor's background. They
also concede that they passed on much of the damaging material used on the ABC
broadcast.;   Pagan backlash;   "I know that he has said things that are not
true," says Don Frew, public information officer for the Covenant of the
Goddess, a well-established pagan group. Frew produces a registered letter he
sent to Bernal warning that Pryor may be out to con the pagans, the Christians
or the world -- and is not to be trusted. He says Bernal never responded to
the letter.;   "I received the letter," Bernal says now. "To me it typified
the paranoia of the pagan community. They seemed to be looking for things that
aren't there. Eric's conversion was real.";   "The purpose of our doing what
was done on this was not to get Eric Pryor," says Eric Marsh, spokesman for
Bay Area Pagan Assemblies (BAPA) -- an organization made up of low-key
practitioners of Wicca, a nature-loving, goddess-worshiping sect, and various
New Age spiritualists.;   "We had someone here who was working through
falsehood to give pagans a black eye," says Marsh. "That continues to be our
reason for following this thing through and documenting it.";   Marsh is a
Wiccan, and thus is particularly miffed at Pryor for casting hurtful spells,
pretending to perform exorcisms and engaging in other other seemingly sinister
rituals.;   "He stirred up a frenzy of media attention," says Marsh, "but he
was talking about hexes and curses -- things that you simply don't do. He
claimed to be Wiccan, but he was not really involved in the Wiccan
community.";   Marsh says the televised "exorcism" ritual was "something we
have never seen before -- and it was also terrible P.R." Marsh also recalls --
and tapes of TV newscasts confirm -- that Pryor performed a bit of public
voodoo, using a black candle as Larry Lea's effigy, and cutting it in half
with a knife.;   "We were not supposed to be doing anything negative," Marsh
complains. "Claiming the effigy is equivalent to Larry Lea was completely
unethical and also serious bad juju. Other people started doing counter-magic
as soon as that happened.";   The "good" witches say they feared Pryor was a
fraud at worst, and real trouble no matter what. "If (Larry Lea) slips off the
stage and breaks his legs or something it is his own karma," Pryor said on one
TV newscast.;   Now, the reborn-again Pryor rails against pagans and gays in
the same frightening manner he had used to curse fundamentalist Christians. In
June, he spoke at a fundamentalist church in Cameron Park, and the local
newspaper quoted him as saying, "My goal is to destroy Satanism, humanism,
paganism, druidism and the practice of homosexuality in our lifetime.";  
Fringe character?;   "I would ask and even beg of Mr. Pryor that he produce
any information he can" about local pagans and their practices, responds Frew.
"He hasn't been on the inside of any major group. He has been on the fringes,
but he has never been a central player.";   As evidence, Frew cites letters
from pagan leaders Pryor claims to have known but who either can't remember
him or recall him as something of a fringe character. In response, Pryor
simply says he was a low-profile witch until he stepped forward to organize
the anti-Lea protest.;   "What do the pagans have against Eric?" asks Bernal,
the Christian fundamentalist preacher. "He has made it public that it is now
his calling in life to tell the world that witchcraft can lead to drug abuse,
alcoholism, murder . . .";   " . . . and self-mutilation," Pryor adds
eagerly.;   Recently, Pryor was guest speaker at an Assembly of God church in
Peoria, Ill., and the local paper reported straightforwardly that he preached
about making big money also being God's work: "There is nothing spiritual
about poverty. The Lord commands you to prosper.";   He is also quoted as
saying "tens of thousands across the country" once practiced paganism under
his leadership.;   It may not be reality, but it played in Peoria.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  I'M SURPRISED that your Religion &amp; Ethics editor chose to do a story on
Stephen Mitchell's new book ("The Gospel Truth?" Dec. 21) several days before
the very reason for the Christmas celebration. Not only does Mitchell, a
non-Christian, attack the character of the New Testament in "debunking" its
unified picture of Jesus Christ, but he adds nothing to the plethora of
negative and arbitrary scholarship on the subject.;   Scholars such as
Mitchell always ignore two obvious facts in their denunciation of the gospels.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Religion &amp; Ethics  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TIMING OF NEW TESTAMENT 'DEBUNKING' QUESTIONED  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Letters  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     1. The New Testament writers either personally followed Jesus or knew those
who did. The Apostle John, for instance, says, "We have seen, we have heard,
we have touched" (1 John 1:1-3). Mitchell wasn't there. He has no scholarly
basis to declare some 2,000 years later that John is a liar. . . .;   2. The
early followers of Jesus were mostly Jews. They believed what they experienced
because they believed in the God of the Old Testament. Miracles never
surprised them because the Hebrew Scriptures are full of miracles. Scholars
who ridicule the gospel stories rarely debunk the Hebrew stories along with
them. Yet both the Old and New Testaments are consistent in their portrayal of
the same God who offers love and help to the world.;   The only point on which
I might agree with Mitchell is that even if we could positively verify every
bit of history in the gospels, we still could not, on the basis of that
history, conclude that Jesus is God's son and the world's savior. That is a
matter of faith, the same faith that sustained hostages Terry Anderson and
David Jacobsen. Those of us who believe in Jesus as mature persons and mature
Christians do so because we have experienced Christ in the midst of life's
situations. And we can assert, not on the basis of scholarly duties, but
rather on the basis of an ongoing reality, that Jesus Christ is who the gospel
writers believed him to be.;   The Rev. Warren Angel; Congregational Christian
Churches; San Jose; Holy Scripture fiction; Stephen Mitchell has a right to
believe and say that Jesus is a fraud or a nut, and honor requires that he
forthrightly so state. Instead, he chooses to water Jesus down to another good
man and Holy Scripture fiction. As for Mitchell's advice to those horrified by
his scholarly "findings" to "take it in and deal with it" -- give me a break!;
  Jesus is either who he claims to be, God's son, or a fraud and a liar.
Mitchell believes Jesus to be a fraud and a liar and the Holy Bible a hoax.;  
Larry Malone; San Jose; Bad timing; In my judgment you used abominably poor
taste in featuring the views of Stephen Mitchell (with a half-page color
photo, no less) on your Religion &amp; Ethics pages the weekend before Christmas.;
  His effort to re-create Jesus and the Scriptures according to his own image
of what Jesus ought to have said and done results in an almost total
theological and spiritual emptiness. His ideas (heresies) are not new, as he
acknowledges. They don't even come close to defining the nature, power and
uniqueness of the Christian faith. Every generation witnesses attempts to make
of Jesus just another human philosopher.;   Readers, many of whom flock to the
churches on Christmas, deserve better from you.;   Gordon A. Selbo; San Jose;
Denying the truth; As a believer in Jesus Christ, I find nothing new or
shocking in what Stephen Mitchell writes or claims in his book "The Gospel
According to Jesus.";   Mitchell is just another in the long history of
educated, intelligent people fervently seeking a way to deny the truth that
struggles to occupy their souls, their minds and their hearts.;   Dan McAfee;
Campbell; Belittling Christianity; Stephen Mitchell's book denies the virgin
birth of Jesus Christ, denies that he performed miracles and termed most of
the stories about him as "myths and legends.";   Would the Mercury have
printed such an offensive article on the eve of the holy days of other
religions? Somehow I doubt it. It has become routine to belittle and offend
Christians and their beliefs.;   Carolyn M. Rose; Santa Clara; Lazarus and the
truth; As part of Stephen Mitchell's work, he has decided that the story of
Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead had no truth in it. While I can't claim to
be a biblical scholar, I wish to point out that even the story of Lazarus may
have factual substance. As most readers know, techniques such as
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation can and have revived the apparently "dead.";  
The Lazarus story certainly raises a distinct possibility that truth lies
behind it.;   Thomas Donaldson; Sunnyvale; Lack of scholarship; If I write my
version of U.S. history and delete all the difficult issues, all the wars, all
the inhumane acts because of my belief that the United States is an
enlightened nation, will you then feature my book and my life on the front
page of the Living section?;   That is precisely what you did in featuring
Stephen Mitchell's beliefs and his book.;   It is surprising how much distance
is given to those who want to rewrite the biblical record without any thought
to real scholarship. Does Mitchell understand anything about the
legal/historical method of proving events of the past? Does he understand
anything about bibliographic tests to prove the reliability of ancient
manuscripts?;   I don't think so.;   Bret Johnson; Pleasanton; Omissions and
biases; I believe that some serious omissions and biases were riddled
throughout the article "Reborn again?" (Religion &amp; Ethics, Dec. 14), about my
conversion from paganism to fundamentalism.;   A quote by reporter Dave
O'Brian says that I bragged about cheating people out of money. "I never said
I was a saint," he quotes me. However, he never qualifies that I was talking
about what I was like before I became a Christian.;   O'Brian also talks about
a re-enacted exorcism I did on Channel 5's "People Are Talking" show. He says,
"But the woman (Pryor) supposedly freed of demonic beings was actually his
live-in girlfriend. (She called him a 'doctor.' He isn't.)" Does the term
witch doctor ring a bell to any of you at the Mercury?;   Now, as for the
pagan community's comments, O'Brian states, "Bay Area pagans willingly agree
they have been digging up dirt on Pryor's background. They also conceded that
they passed on much of the damaging material used on the ABC 'Prime Time'
broadcast." O'Brian told me during the interview that the pagan material I had
presented to him was irrelevant. Irrelevant as in what -- when it is used
arbitrarily to hurt someone like myself?;   Don Frew of the Covenant of the
Goddess, an organization that O'Brian states is a well-established pagan
group, said, "I know that (Pryor) has said things that are not true." Don Frew
wouldn't know that truth if it jumped up and smacked him in the face. And the
Covenant of the Goddess is not a well-established organization; it's just a
bunch of burnouts grasping at straws and engaging in intellectual gymnastics.;
  As for Eric Marsh, spokesman for the Bay Area Pagan Assemblies, O'Brian said
that Marsh is a Wiccan and therefore particularly miffed at me for casting
hurtful spells and pretending to perform exorcisms and other seemingly
sinister rituals. "He claimed to be a Wiccan," Marsh says of me, "but was not
really involved in the Wiccan community." I showed O'Brian my BAPA (Wicca
community) membership card, but of course that counts for nothing, right?;  
All in all, if I was a nobody from nowhere, then why did these good witches
even bother showing up at my old New Earth temple public cursing ritual of
Larry Lea? Which, by the way, was the most widely documented cursing ever on
television.;   I gave O'Brian . . . footage of my temple and showed beyond a
shadow of a doubt that I was deeply involved in the pagan community. Or is it
that the pagan community can whine and moan and have its statements reported
as fact but when a Christian makes a statement of fact and verifies it with
filmed and written documentation, it has no meaning.;   Eric J. Pryor;

<TEXT>     Background: Raised a Methodist, she became disillusioned with her faith in
her teens. The years that followed were spent as an agnostic as she explored
different faiths. "All I found were religions that were too patriarchal, too
high-energy or loaded with the same problems.";    Four years ago, she

the control of their own destiny through karma and reincarnation. "Everything

convince her family.;    Working on: President of the Bay Area Pagan

pagans to find other pagans," she says. "We're not listed in the yellow pages
under churches." For the past three years, the group's monthly Gaia's Gateway
meetings at Palo Alto Unitarian Church have provided seekers of paganism a
place for informative talk and ritual.;    "BAPA's goals are outreach and
education," she says. "We want to make the public aware that we don't worship
the devil. And we want to break the negative stereotyping associated with the
practice of 'witchcraft.' " Long term, the organization would like to create
day care facilities, hospitals and nursing homes for pagans, like other
churches. In the meantime, members meet throughout the year for social events,
holidays and participate in fund-raisers to reach their goal.;    Home:

<LEADPARA>  Drunken sex orgies? Kestryl Angell asked with a laugh. "I have never gotten an
invitation." Angell is a witch and she was answering one of the usual dumb
questions about covens.;    The reason reporters were questioning her this
week is that she was taping what has to be the world's first TV talk show for
witches. The initial installment will run June 6 but don't look for it in the
listings. It's broadcast over a public access station in Arlington, Va.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ANOTHER TV FIRST: PRESENTING THE WITCHING
HALF-HOUR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  People .
Information in this column is from Mercury news wire services.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Angell is the host. The producer is her roommate Cheryl Costa, a.k.a. Lady
Cassandra, high priestess of Wicca.;    They describe themselves as "good
witches," which we think means they won't turn you into anything uglier than a
frog. They say they reject devil worship and black magic, being instead
devoted to love, trust and spiritual healing.;    Reporters on the set
describe the scene: Angell prepares an altar of burning candles, chalices, a
dagger, a pair of deer antlers, a tiny broom and icons of some goddesses whose
names the scribblers didn't catch. Her sacred space is purified by the wave of
a carved wooden wand, and whiffs of burning incense and the tinkling of a bell
give the heebie-jeebies to any evil spirits in the studio and makes them
hightail it.;    With a graceful shake of her long auburn hair, the blue-robed
priestess and her two guests sit on plump floor cushions on a braided rug
beneath the altar. Angell peers into the camera and says quietly: "Good
evening. I'm Kestryl. Welcome to my circle.";    The guests, by the way, were
Susan Hill, an electronics technician, and Diana Sunday, a technical writer.
Hill calls herself a modern Druid whose worship is "directed toward healing
the earth." Sunday follows shamanism, which evokes the world of animal
spirits.;    "After a hard day at work," Sunday explains, "I meditate and
imagine I'm a deer leaping across a meadow.";    Costa estimates that more
than 1,200 witches are living secretly in the Washington-Baltimore area but it
takes more than magic to get them to appear on TV. Apparently there's
something about announcing yourself as a witch that turns off employers,
neighbors, etc.;    Another problem of production was the usual one: money.
Costa says she conjured only enough to run local, half-hour biweekly shows for
one summer.;    Maybe the rest of us will get to see them through the magic of
reruns.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Pumpkin festivals are sprouting in some school districts, where
parents are trying to keep Halloween out of the hallways and off
school grounds because of its connection with witches and Satan.
   In Alachua County, Fla., Robert Guyer gathered the signatures of
about 200 fellow parents who think the holiday is a religious
celebration of Wicca, a modern pagan witchcraft cult.
   When teachers dress up like witches, ``what happens to these
little Christian kids like mine?'' asked Guyer, a University of
Florida law student. ``How are they going to feel when it's
dress-up day and they don't dress up?''
   Officials in Alachua County left the decision on Halloween to
school principals.
   In neighboring Levy County, the superintendent asked schools to
avoid using Halloween decorations and to cancel school celebrations.
   Halloween, which is being celebrated Tuesday night, apparently
sprang from an ancient ceremony honoring the Celtic god of death.
In medieval England, it came to be known as All Hallows' Eve,
celebrated before the feast day of All Hallows, now All Saints'
Day. As is the case with the pagan Christmas tree, few pay
attention to its religious origins.
   But Guyer cites a recent 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling in Atlanta that found that prayers before high school
football games violate the constitutional separation of church and
state.
   ``As Easter has been banned in favor of spring holiday, as
Christmas has been banned in favor of winter holiday, so, too,
Halloween should be banned in favor of fall holiday,'' he said.
   The Rev. Bill Ligon of Brunswick, Ga., agreed: ``Some of the
symbolism used for Halloween is used also by recognized religions.
I think the law as interpreted by the 11th Circuit should be
impartially applied to any religious activity at school.''
   Halloween's defenders say it has become a non-religious holiday.
   ``The witches and goblins of Halloween are no more believable
than Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy. ... Are they
going to ban those, too?''asked Charley Mack, a father of six in
Tallahassee, Fla., where several schools are inaugurating ``harvest
festivals'' in place of Halloween.
   In Texas, Harlingen Superintendent T. Carl McMillan responded to
parents' anxieties by asking principals to tone down celebrations.
   ``I asked them to review their practices and if they had
anything that depicted blood and gore to try to eliminate that,''
McMillan said.
   An elementary school in Amarillo planned to celebrate Pumpkin
Fun Day rather than Halloween.
   And in Frederick County, Md., three elementary schools have
discontinued Halloween events. At least one decided to hold a fall
celebration instead.
   ``I personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our
instructional curriculum,'' said John Thompson, a county school
official.
   Parents are upset by lurid descriptions of devil worship on
television and in rock music, said Fred Eisenbraun of the Rapid
City Cops for Christ, in South Dakota.
   Eisenbraun was in Worthington, Minn., last week to conduct an
Occult Awareness Seminar for teachers, parents and teen-agers.
   ``Satanists do not isolate themselves to New York, to Denver or
to Dallas,'' Eisenbraun said. ``They like rural areas, like
Worthington, Minnesota, or Rapid City, South Dakota, where there's
an availability of abandoned buildings, animals, and wide-open
areas where there aren't enough cops to check on them.''
   The popularity of slasher movies and costumes that imitate them
worry other parents.
   Movies like ``Halloween'' and ``Friday the 13th,'' are popular
enough to make their protagonists among the hottest-selling
costumes this year, outfitters say _ along with Batman and Jim and
Tammy Bakker.
   But Freddy Krueger, the ogre of Elm Street, isn't invited to the
Halloween party at the Bethesda Elementary School in Waukesha, Wis.
Students there were forbidden from dressing as characters in any of
the graphically violent movies, said Principal Nancy Marsho.
   ``We don't appreciate Freddy here at Bethesda,'' Ms. Marsho said.

   The Salvation Army violated a woman's
constitutional right to freedom of religion when it fired her
because she practices witchcraft, a federal judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Dan M. Russell of Biloxi ruled last week that
the Salvation Army cannot discriminate against witches because it
receives federal funds for some programs.
   Jamie Kellam Dodge, a former victim's assistance coordinator at
the Pascagoula-based Salvation Army Domestic Violence Shelter, filed
a $1.25 million lawsuit against the Salvation Army. She sought
reinstatement and compensation for embarrassment, humiliation, pain
and suffering. A ruling on compensation will be made later, court
officials said.
   Dodge, 28, was fired in August 1987 after she admitted using the
agency copy machine to copy Satanic-Wiccan rituals, according to
court records.
   ``If you could see it, you would agree it was horrible. It talked
about sexual things, around the fire, lots of things that are
contrary to Salvation Army policies,'' Raymond Brown, an attorney
for the Salvation Army, said Saturday.
   The Salvation Army has not decided whether it will appeal the
decision, he said.
   Dodge's attorney, David Frazier of Pascagoula, called Russell's
decision ``courageous.''
   ``He bit the bullet and did what a federal judge is supposed to
do, to cite tough decisions in an effort to follow the law,''
Frazier said.

   Massachusetts' ``official witch'' has begun a
letter-writing campaign to protest what she and other witches
believe are violations of their civil rights.
   Letters of complaint, stemming from news reports linking a
``witch'' to a cult of drug smugglers connected with the
ritualistic deaths of 15 people found near the Texas-Mexico border,
have been sent to major newspapers and television networks from
Laurie Cabot's Salem-based group, Witches League for Self-Awareness.
   ``We are not satanists, we do not do black magic or any evil
magic,'' said Cabot, who formed the 900-member group in 1986,
shortly after the filming of ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' a movie
witches said made them appear ``stupid.''
   In group literature, the league is described as a ``national and
international anti-defamation organization which is working to
protect the civil rights, dignity and public portrayal of over six
million Witches, Pagans and Pantheists.''
   The witches complained they have been ``portrayed in an
inaccurate, offensive and libelous manner which is in violation of
our constitutionally guaranteed civil right to practice religious
freedom, as well as freedom from harassment, discrimination,
persecution, or the incitement of the public to form adverse
opinions of members of a religious community.''
   Cabot, dubbed the ``official witch'' by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
in 1975, said Tuesday that she and other witches are part of a
legally recognized religion that is ``peaceful'' and devoid of the
evil doings associated with witchcraft stereotypes.
   The recent complaints sent to news organizations such as The New
York Times and NBC News stemmed from news reports about the
murderous cult of drug smugglers in Texas.
   Mexican police have termed Sara Aldrete, the missing 24-year-old
college student believed to be one of the cult leaders, a ``witch.''
   She has been linked to the 15 victims of the cult, some of which
were unearthed at a ranch south of the U.S. border last week.
   ``It's very loose terminology,'' said Cabot. ``These were drug
runners. What they were doing had nothing to do with witchcraft.
Witchcraft has no evil gods.''
   Cabot described witchcraft as a ``nature religion'' that uses a
mixture of astronomy, astrology and psychic powers to heal and make
things better. She said they use potions and cast spells to promote
well-being and general good.
   ``We have families, we have children, I belong to Kiwanis and
the Chamber of Commerce, you know,'' said Cabot, who once owned a
witchcraft store in Salem and is now writing books.
   She said the group hopes to ``re-educate'' people through the
complaints but added that they could someday take court action if
they believe their rights have been seriously violated.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The grim legacy of the 'witches' of Salem: Three hundred
years ago 20 innocent people were executed in a frenzy of demon-hunting.
Today, Salem's ghosts still haunt us
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BRIGGS

<TEXT>
THREE HUNDRED years ago on Tuesday an execution took place at Gallows Hill
near Salem Village, Massachusetts, which has since haunted America's
national consciousness. Seven women and a man were hanged for witchcraft,
mainly on the evidence of a group of village girls who were apparently
suffering fits and seizures after experimenting with the occult.
These victims turned down the chance to save their lives by confessing their
guilt. Three days earlier 80-year-old Giles Cory had been crushed to death,
with stones piled on his chest, for refusing even to plead before the
special court set up to try these innocent people. Up to this point, 20 men
and women, mostly humble people, had been executed at Salem.
This started an epidemic of denunciations and arrests in nearby towns,
during which more than 100 suspects languished in makeshift jails. The Devil
was abroad among God's people in New England, many of whom came to believe
that he might deceive judges as well as witches.
Tourists who watch reconstructions of Cory's death (complete with recorded
groans) at the Salem Witch Museum may see those events as belonging to a
remote and primitive culture. Yet now thousands of people openly choose to
be witches, attending covens and practising rituals. Thousands of books for
children are about witches, either benign or terrifying. Horror movies bare
their fangs at every other cinema and fill the video shops, while books and
magazines on the occult proliferate.
Although this explosion of interest in Satanism is mostly ersatz, recent
historical research is transforming our understanding of witchcraft in the
Western past and often suggests more disturbing parallels with modern
events.
It now seems that the most famous reincarnation of the witches of 1692, in
Arthur Miller's powerful play, The Crucible, may be a misleading view of the
true cause and significance of the witch hunt. For Miller, the victims of
Salem stand for the individual conscience against theocracy and 'the
repressions of order', with explicit reference to the odious Senator
McCarthy and his anti-communist crusade in the 1950s. Now, 40 years later,
even more sinister parallels spring to mind.
Witchcraft is back among us with a vengeance when families are torn apart on
charges of Satanic rituals supposedly attested by their own children. In the
UK, a series of ritual abuse cases were supposedly discovered by social
service investigators in the Orkney Islands and then in Rochdale, northern
England. These followed an epidemic of sexual abuse cases in Cleveland in
1987. In spite of obvious differences, these cases showed a strangely
similar pattern to that in Salem three centuries before: intense questioning
of children to produce the denunciation of adults; the inner certainty of
interrogators that evil practices were widespread; passionate denials of
guilt; and failures to obey the ordinary rules of evidence.
Miller focused on the principled defiance of theocracy by John Procter, a
man who, having fallen from grace through adultery with his maidservant,
finally tore up the confession that would have saved him, thus gaining a
moral victory over his persecutors. However, the true story of the hidden
evil in Salem Village is more subtle and has only been apparent since the
publication of a brilliant book by two young American historians, Paul Boyer
and Stephen Nissenbaum, called Salem Possessed, which finally fitted the
jigsaw together.
As Miller partly understood, the central issues were to do with the nature
of the community and the power struggle between individuals within it. Salem
Village (now Danvers) was the agricultural hinterland of the thriving port
of Salem, a dependent region lacking proper institutions and struggling even
to create its own church. The community was split between those linked to
the cosmopolitan, commercial world of the town and the poorer, less
sophisticated farmers further inland. There were two rival families from the
initial settlement: the Porters, who had grown rich from the town, and the
Putnams, whose land was being subdivided among too many children.
The epicentre of the witch hunt lay in the house of Thomas Putnam, eldest
son in the third generation. His wife and daughter were prominent among the
group of 'possessed' women. It was this group which gave the crucial
evidence of witchcraft, partly to protect themselves against suspicions of
satanic practices. They cried out in court that they had been tormented by
the accused and described visions which were held to prove that the accused
had made pacts with Devil to take possession of their souls. Putnam and his
family were the main supporters of Samuel Parris, minister of Salem Village,
another man on the economic downslope. Parris's insecurities did much to fan
the blaze of the witch hunt.
Thomas Putnam was a man with many grievances, much given to unsuccessful
lawsuits. One alleged he had been cheated over his wife's inheritance,
another - the vital one - was against his stepmother and his half-brother,
Joseph. His father had left his best land to this favoured child of his old
age, who had just married into the rival Porter family, and ostentatiously
sided with them in local politics.
Although they were never directly accused, these treacherous relatives and
the Porters were the real target for the family's anger. Almost every
accused person in the Salem trials can be connected with them in some way,
just as all the accusers were Putnams and their allies. It is highly
unlikely that there was a deliberate conspiracy. Since the weak were
attacking the strong, they could only do so in surrogate form - by imagining
a diabolical conspiracy.
Resistance began to mount when charges extended to people of real substance.
By the autumn of 1692, the leading Puritan ministers in the colony and the
Governor intervened to halt the trials; those in prison were freed.
Over the next 20 years various acts of public penance would try to atone for
what the Boston minister Cotton Mather, who was consulted about procedures
for the trials, called: 'Those errors whereby great hardships were brought
upon innocent persons, and (we fear) guilt incurred which we have all cause
to bewail with much confusion of face before the Lord.' Puritans knew how to
repent with a sincerity and force rarely shown by modern persecutors.
The persecution proved a disaster for its makers. Parris lost his position
as minister and any hopes of personal recovery. Within a generation the
surviving Putnams (other than the prosperous Joseph) had sold their
dwindling property and left.
Witchcraft prosecutions had rarely been much favoured by the churches, and
played little part in maintaining their authority, in either the old world
or the new. So the analogy conjured by the modern term 'witch hunt' - with
the show trials of Stalin or McCarthy is weak. Similarly, the traditional
witchcraft the colonists had brought from England bore little relation to
modern imitations. This 'old witchcraft' still exists in parts of rural
Europe, where a belief that one is bewitched has been known to cause death.
As recently as 1976 two brothers in Orne in France shot dead the male
'witch' they blamed for their misfortunes.
Then, as now, the basis of witchcraft had little to do with formal religion.
It is in a general sense pagan, with an immensely long history. By
comparison, the persecution of witchcraft was brief; after a scattering of
early trials in the 15th century, most executions in Europe took place
between 1580 and 1650. In all between 50,000 and 100,000 people were put to
death as witches.
Between a fifth and a quarter of these were men, while midwives, always said
to be especially vulnerable, were in fact rarely prosecuted. Educated
witch-hunters played only a marginal role; they were probably no more
representative of elite opinion than the zealous pursuers of ritual Satanism
are today. Most witches went on trial because their neighbours, who hated
and feared them, blamed them for specific misfortunes - usually the deaths
of spouses, children or animals - following a quarrel. Behind it all lay not
the clergy but their rivals, the local wizards and wise-women who functioned
as witch-doctors and were skilled in making clients articulate their
suspicions.
Population growth, economic change and harvest failures made the decades
around the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries some of the harshest ever
experienced by the ordinary people of Europe. It was natural that
accusations should multiply, and this would not have mattered so much if the
reaction had been confined to counter-magic and the occasional lynching.
Unfortunately, the pressure from below coincided with a temporary decline in
elite scepticism. The reasons for this are complex, but it should be
stressed that it was very relative. Critics of witchcraft prosecutions were
numerous and soon became more vocal, as happened in Massachusetts.
Accusations of diabolical possession was seen as particularly dangerous, for
fraud was readily suspected and quite often detected. Another famous case
was that of the Devils of Loudun in 1634, where a group of 'possessed' nuns
accused a local priest who was burned at the stake.
A sober look at witchcraft in history strips away almost all the
pseudo-historical clothing in which the modern witch cults have tried to
deck themselves. Some of their rituals and gods do have origins in pagan
culture, but the witches' 'sabbat', (a nocturnal Satanic meeting) existed
only in the imaginary world of folklore.
It is striking that many of the most lurid accounts in witchcraft trials
came from children and adolescents. This should be a reminder of the danger
of accepting their testimony in modern allegations of satanic practices. One
does not care to think too long on the nine-year-old girl from Lorraine who
told stories about going to the 'sabbat' in a cart with her whole family, as
a result of which her father, grandparents, uncle and aunt were all burned
in 1602. In later years she might have whispered to her confessor something
akin to the moving words of Ann Putnam Jr. when she was admitted to church
membership in 1706: 'I desire to lie in the dust and be humbled for it, in
that I was a cause with others of so sad a calamity to them and their
families.'
It is a poignant reminder that the real evil lies within ourselves, as much
in the age of child abuse as in that of 'demonic' possession.

ARTIST REFUSES TO PLAY IT SAFE;

<P>
CURTIS YORK'S POLITICALLY PROVOCATIVE PERFORMANCES REGULARLY STIR UP 
CONTROVERSY AND ANGER.

Some observers and art lovers are fretting over whether people who make art are 
going to turn timid in the face of congressional inquiries into federal arts 
funding. National Endowment for the Arts budget cuts today, rampant censorship 
tomorrow: That's the worst scenario, but, some feel, not an outlandish one. 
Will artists start reasoning that it's better to play it safe right now, until 
all this blows over -- thus employing a subtle form of censorship? Will they be 
hit with their own case of "The Wimp Factor"? 
</P>
<P>
A few may, but don't count on performance artist Curtis York. A former student 
of Utah's Weber State College and the University of Utah, York came to Los 
Angeles with $50 in his pocket to study with performance artist Rachel 
Rosenthal. After four years of presenting his own and others' work, York, 26, 
who wears leather clothes and sports a Mohawk haircut, has regularly stirred up 
controversy -- and some anger -- with a collection of politically provocative 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the working title of a piece planned for Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions: "Autoeroticurtis." Or his latest, at Highways in 
Santa Monica: "The United States of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
That's nothing compared to an early working title, which was -- Jesse Helms, 
are you listening? -- "Flaming Faggot, Burning Witch." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, York hopes that Helms, or one of his local allies, is listening. 
"This is especially meant for right-wing Christians to see. If their faith is 
strong enough, hearing a little truth about history won't shake it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, York warns: "The time to be polite is over. No one can tell 
artists what they can and can't do." 
</P>
<P>
It is a careful tightrope York is walking with "The United States of Christ." 
With his collaborator and longtime friend, author Frosti, the professional name 
of Scott Simpson, York says his intent is to deliver a warning against trying 
to bridge the separation of church and state as well as deliver a theatrical 
message of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Not an easy trick, considering the charged emotions surrounding some of the 
show's themes, such as abortion rights, and freedom of expression. Though a 
scene shows one of York's characters (he plays 15 in all), a Roman Catholic 
priest, flagellating himself to sexual ecstasy after flubbing a Communion 
ceremony, he also states: "I can't stress enough that this isn't an 
anti-Christian piece." 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist Rosenthal said, "He puts himself on the line morally and 
politically. His pieces are strong, but they're never a lecture. As a gay man, 
he feels threatened by religious fanatics and others who would suppress him. He 
has a fearlessness for confronting hard issues." 
</P>
<P>
York's use of complex and clashing currents in his work is consistent, even 
when it means disturbing his audience and friends. He freely admits that his 
1989 show, "Blackout," was "very sacrilegious and upset a lot of people." In 
response to "Meet the Mormons," which York, targeting the Mormon Church, 
performed last year with Robert Daniels at Highways, one letter writer to The 
Times condemned the show for "attacking prejudice with prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Frosti, York's pal since high school, said he was very offended by it, and told 
York as much. "I knew that Curtis was coming from deep personal pain when he 
did that show, but the Mormon Church as a whole shouldn't have been held 
responsible for some of his terrible experiences. Individuals should have. We 
were both raised in that religion. He had bad experiences; I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But, York reveals that after staging "Meet the Mormons" he went through "a 
forgiveness process. I forgave the Mormons I knew growing up, and I forgave 
myself." In many ways, that performance was the catalyst for "The United States 
of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Another was Frosti's research, triggered by his involvement in the pro-choice 
movement, into Roman Catholic Church history. Meanwhile, York had been 
performing in others' pieces, notably John Fleck's "Blessed Are All the Little 
Fishes" and the Peter Brosius/Dennis Cooper/Ishmael Houston-Jones work, "The 
Undead" (at the Mark Taper Forum's 1989 Taper Lab and planned for the Los 
Angeles Festival in September). 
</P>
<P>
"I was incredibly busy," York said, "but the ideas emerging out of Frosti's 
research demanded to be played out before an audience." Delving into Vatican 
history as a model of what happens when a religious institution assumes the 
power of the state, Frosti found useful material in books such as "Vicars of 
Christ: The Dark Side of the Papacy" by ex-priest Peter De Rosa and "Outline of 
Ecclesiastical History" by B.H. Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
A theatrical strategy emerged from the research, which was to draw parallels 
(through various characters York portrayed) between past and present. So such 
episodes as the Catholic involvement in the Inquisition, or the Vatican's 
ability to tax many of the royal courts of Europe, are interwoven with American 
Christian fundamentalist efforts to institutionalize school prayer, ban books 
or make abortion illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Why focus on Catholicism? "We're artists in the Western tradition," said York, 
"and the Catholic Church has been a powerful political force in the West. It's 
what we know. But there's a broader concern, and that is to show that it's not 
healthy for people to practice religious fascism and not know history. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised a Christian and with Christianity's humane morals, and I'm glad 
of that. It would be cool if everyone followed the Golden Rule -- 'Do unto 
others . . . ' -- which is what the faith comes down to. But when one's beliefs 
cross over from personal choices to attempts to influence others' choices, that 
is going too far." 
</P>
<P>
When York added that "no one should be prevented from practicing their 
religion," he meant this in a personal way. As a witch and follower of the 
Wicca faith, an earth-based religion, he is cognizant of the legacy of the 
persecution of witches by more traditional religions. "Nothing more could be 
done to my religion than has already been done to it." 
</P>
<P>
He winced reporting the methods of torture of suspected homosexuals during the 
Inquisition in Spain, France and Italy, revealed by Frosti's research. York 
said the show is "including historical material that hasn't been presented 
publicly before." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, York would like to go even more public than he already has. He 
would like to go back out on the road, possibly disturbing audiences along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I want to be internationally famous or anything," he said 
sheepishly, "but I think the content in my pieces deserves to be heard by more 
people than in L.A. and New York. I'd like to go off the usual performance art 
circuit, into cities like Tucson and Boise. There are open-minded people there, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States of Christ" continues at Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa 
Monica, today and April 1, 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $10. (213) 453-1755.

   Our friends at the ACLU's national office try to impress on us from time to time that the ACLU is a "decentralized" organization. 
A few more cases like the following, and we may have to sign on to this explanation. 
The ACLU in Providence, Rhode Island, got a tax administrator to rule that a coven of witches is entitled to the same tax-exempt treatment as any established religion. 
"With this ruling," said the high priestess of Rosegate Coven, "we witches will definitely be able to come out of the closet and take our place in society." 
Who would doubt it? 
If the IRS doesn't drive a stake through this latest ACLU creation, expect more Americans to declare themselves operators of a "religion."

   Ipsita Roy Chakrabarty, self-described
witch and former schoolteacher, is accusing officials of failing to
protect witches in West Bengal state, where at least 20 suspected
sorcerers were murdered last year.
   The 44-year-old housewife went public Saturday after Chief
Minister Jyoti Basu, the top government official of West Bengal
state, disclosed the slayings during a discussion on crime in the
state.
   ``Are we repeating and perpetrating the misdeeds and mistakes of
medieval Europe ?'' Mrs. Chakrabarty said. ``Why is there nobody to
call the killing of witches in present-day India brutal and
superstitious ?''
   Basu, who heads the Communist Marxist Party in West Bengal, said
April 27 that at least 27 people had been arrested in the killings
of the suspected witches in the eastern state, which borders
Bangladesh.
   Basu had no details on how the women were killed or who was
arrested, but he said the women were slain only because they were
suspected of practicing witchcraft.
   Tribal members in parts of West Bengal believe that many women,
especially widows, have the power to heal the sick and the ability
to cast evil spells. Women thought to be witches often are attacked
when misfortune befalls members of the tribe.
   ``There is no such woman as the storybook witch,'' Mrs.
Chakrabarty told a news conference in Calcutta, capital of West
Bengal state.
   ``It is unthinkable that Jyoti Basu, leading a Marxist
government which believes neither in God nor the devil, should
nonchalantly reel out figures of the murders of innocent women as a
piece of statistics.''
   Mrs. Chakrabarty said she is the eastern high priestess of a
Montreal-based coven, which she refused to identify further.
   She told reporters that she lived in the Canadian city when she
was a young woman before returning to her parents' home in Calcutta
in 1968 to complete her education. She majored in English
literature and taught at a prestigious secondary school before her
marriage.
   Her husband is a government official, but she prefers not to
publicize his name and job title for fear of repercussions. The
couple has a 10-year-old daughter.
   ``Witchcraft is not black magic, and it need not necessarily be
evil,'' Mrs. Chakrabarty said. ``It can be misused, but that
depends on the practitioner. Any science can be evil if put into
the wrong hands.
   ``I, as the high priestess of a witches' coven, claim that we
have worked successfully for the benefit of individuals who have
been suffering from various disorders,'' she said. ``We are not
superwomen, but we have succeeded in helping where conventional
science has failed.''
   Mrs. Chakrabarty said witches use water electrically charged by
touch or rock quartz to cure the sick.
   ``Our touch can calm. Our eyes can comfort or impart energy if
the need be so,'' she said. ``We believe that the powers we invoke
from the outer elements charge us with a certain strength, which
can pass onto others.''

   Saturday night, Jennifer Thoren hung up her stocking with
care, left out a cup of cocoa and cookies for Santa and went
to bed with visions of sugarplums dancing in her head. Yes,
Saturday.
   For 11-year-old Jennifer, Dec. 22 -- the winter solstice,
when daylight starts growing longer again -- is the day that
matters, not Dec. 25. 'Tis the season, solstice celebrants
say, for sending solstice cards, trimming solstice trees and
exchanging solstice gifts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Solstice predates Christmas by many centuries," says
Robert Brooks, a 54-year-old auto-plant machine repairman,
who lives in Madison Heights, Mich. Pagan solstice
celebrations date back 2,000 years before Christ was born, he
adds. "We feel the holiday was kind of taken over by modern
religion."
   Mr. Brooks happens to be an atheist, so he's prone to be
put out by all the hoopla celebrating the birth of Jesus. But
atheists are hardly the only ones who celebrated the winter
solstice yesterday. Wiccan followers, or witches, observe the
day with gift exchanges, decorated trees and candle-lit
ceremonies. Planet Drum, an ecological education group in San
Francisco, gathers hundreds of members around a bonfire for a
ceremony involving drumming and music. No one knows for
certain how many other people observe the day.
   Nacolle Parsons, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for one, feels
extremely "put upon" this time of year. "I get so tired of
{Christmas carols} being crammed at me. Everywhere, there are
Christmas sales. No one else's ideas get accepted," grumbles
Ms. Parsons, who manages a fan club for actor Mark Hamill.
   Not that solstice celebrants are a bunch of Grinches.
Children found stockings stuffed and presents under their
Christmas, uh, solstice trees yesterday morning. "You've got
to do something so your kids don't feel different or left
out," explains Ann Zindler, a housewife in Columbus, Ohio.
   Even Santa Claus is acceptable. Despite his historical
connection with St. Nicholas, solstice celebrants contend
that Santa is a secular figure in America, not a religious
one. "I'm not heartless," says Ellen Johnson, a homemaker in
Rockaway Township, N.J., who adds that her three-year-old son
"can enjoy the character just like everybody else."
   Jennifer Thoren strings popcorn for her family's solstice
tree, sings "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" and explains to
friends at her San Francisco school why she celebrates the
solstice. To make it easier, this year her mother, Pamela,
addressed children at her school about winter solstice, the
date when the Earth's axis begins to tilt toward the sun and
days start getting longer. "We think it's only fair for kids
to see the other side of the coin," says Ms. Thoren, a
health-care worker.
   Still, some things are avoided, even though there are no
set traditions for the winter solstice celebration. Patricia
Wilkinson, a homemaker in Phoenix, Ariz., shuns traditional
angel and drummer-boy ornaments for her solstice tree,
instead using homemade egg-shell ornaments adorned with
ribbons and buttons. "They represent a new beginning,"
explains Ms. Wilkinson. She and her husband, Walter, don't
exchange gifts on solstice; instead, they invite some of
their atheist friends over for a potluck dinner.
   But many solstice celebrants send solstice cards, with
greetings like, "Solstice Claus is coming to town]" and
"Merry Solstice." A few cards poke fun at religion, offending
some people. "These are anti-Christian {messages}, not
pro-pagan. They're vicious," says Rev. Donald Wildmon,
president of the American Family Association, a Christian
activist group in Tupelo, Miss. "These people see Christians
having a good time celebrating and they feel left out.
They're seeking joy but they'll never find joy by pulling
others down."
   Still, many historians say Christians appropriated the
holiday from the pagans. No one knows for certain when Jesus
was born, but "most scholars believe Jesus was born closer to
spring or summer," says Delores Carpenter, associate dean of
Howard University's School of Divinity.
   Winter solstice was being observed as a sacred celebration
of the sun god by ancient Egyptians as early as 1996 B.C. and
as late as about 274 A.D. in Rome, says Loyd Allen, associate
professor of church history at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   In the years following the first recorded Christmas
celebration in 336 A.D., Christians copied many solstice
traditions, including gift giving, feasting, the decorating
of evergreen trees and the use of holly, mistletoe, candles
and wreaths.
   Despite all the history, some solstice celebrants have
adopted a distinctly contemporary approach. When it comes to
music, computer programmer Chris Allen of Salt Lake City
eschews traditional carols, preferring such favorites as the
Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun." Says Mr. Allen: "It fits right
with the season."

<LEADPARA>  A national organization at the forefront of First Amendment challenges has
filed suit in Sacramento to block the Woodland Joint Unified School District's
use of parts of the controversial Impressions textbook series.;    The

the recent 2 Live Crew and National Endowment for the Arts controversies, said
the suit could provide leverage against other school districts that use the
series.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court on behalf of two
Woodland parents, is believed to be the first in California to challenge the
content of the textbook series. It contends that Impressions "endorses and
sponsors the religion of Wicca or Witchcraft" and "violates the First
Amendment's Establishment of Religion Clause." The suit requests an injunction
against use of "occultic portions of the curriculum.";    Scott Thomas, a San
Jose attorney, said, "By requiring participation in religious activity, the
state through the school district is sponsoring religion." Thomas is serving
as local counsel in the suit for the AFA, a conservative Christian watch-dog
organization. Bob Watt, superintendent for the Yolo County district, said
Wednesday that he had not seen the lawsuit and could not discuss it.;   
Impressions has been adopted for use in elementary schools in about 70
California districts. More than 20 districts have faced attempts to have the
series banned and four have returned the books to the publisher, Holt,
Rinehart and Winston. The publishing house is a subsidiary of Harcourt, Brace,
Jovanovich.;    In the South Bay, parents have complained about the books in
the Saratoga Union School District, which uses the series in kindergarten
through fifth grades, and the Campbell Union School District, where the series
is a supplement to the core literature program in kindergarten through fourth
grades. Thomas is a parent in Campbell and has opposed the use of the series
there.;    The books were challenged last year by parents in Union City's New
Haven Unified School District, too, but the district retained the texts.;   
Impressions, a colorful collection of classic and contemporary children's
literature, has won vehement supporters and opponents nationwide since its
introduction in the mid-1980s. Supporters praise it for engaging student minds
with quality literature rather than "dumbing-down" the writing. Opponents say
the books are too violent or graphic, encourage witchcraft or Satanism and
don't have enough "American-oriented" stories.;    The suit brought by the AFA
is believed to be only the second one in the country to challenge the content
of the books. The AFA brought a similar suit late last year against a district
in Ohio.;    The implications for other districts remain unclear. Elliot
Mincberg, legal director for the censorship watchdog group People for the
American Way, said, "It reflects an attempt to open up another front in this
cultural civil war.";    While the growing controversy may inhibit some
districts elsewhere from trying the series, the books are already so
controversial in California that the suit may have little impact, he said.
Mincberg said the AFA's claims about the books are "without basis."  </TEXT>

   Witchcraft is not uncommon in Mexico, where
open air markets sell magic amulets and powders and where one can
easily hire a witch to cast a spell on a rival.
   But an anthropologist consulted Tuesday said satanic rituals are
rare. Police believe such rituals were performed in the killings of
12 people in the northern border city of Matamoros.
   The bodies, including that of a 21-year-old University of Texas
student, were discovered in a mass grave Tuesday on a ranch just
south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Police said a satanic cult of drug smugglers killed them in
hopes that human sacrifice would protect them.
   ``This is the most horrible thing ever seen in the city's
history,'' said Enriqueta Hernandez, a reporter covering the story
for the Matamoros daily El Bravo. ``This is more like something you
would hear about in Veracruz or Oaxaca.''
   The southern states of Veracruz and Oaxaca are known for their
large numbers of ``brujos'', or witches, and their occult rites.
   But even in those areas, the rites are not considered
``satanic'' because they have no connection with the Christian
devil. The witches may sacrifice animals such as black-feathered
roosters, but ritual killings of human beings are almost unheard of.
   American anthropologists William and Claudia Medsen
differentiate between Mexico's traditional Indian witches and what
they call ``satanic witches'' in their 1969 book ``The American
Guide to Mexican Witchcraft.''
   ``The satanic witchcraft practiced in cities and towns is a far
cry from Indian witchcraft, although this distinction has been
ignored by anthropologists,'' they wrote. ``Indian witchcraft has
little or no connection with the Christian devil, who dominates the
suburban sorcery scene.
   ``The most feared witches in urban Mexico are those who make
pacts with the devil. A satanic witch voluntarily sells his soul to
the devil in exchange for wealth and power,'' the book says.
   An anthropologist at the National Anthropology and History
Institute said satanic cults are rare in Mexico because they are
elitist and expensive, in part because of drugs used in the
ceremonies.
   ``From colonial times, it never was successful'' in Mexico, said
the anthropologist, who asked that her name not be used.
   On the other hand, herbal medicine and use of witch doctors,
called ``curanderos,'' is common in Mexico. Most markets have
stalls where herbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or
bad spells or to cleanse a home of evil.
   Human sacrifice was common in the country's pre-Columbian Indian
cultures; the Aztecs killed thousands every year, usually captured
enemy soldiers, and practiced cannibalism.
   Human sacrifice is little known now, although not unheard of. It
is said to be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is
killed as part of the process of curing another.
   Tomas Rojas, a police reporter for the Mexico City tabloid La
Prensa, said one of the few cases he had heard of involved the
slaying of an unidentifed man whose headless body was discovered
about three months ago next to a hill in the northern part of the
city.
   Rojas said officials found the body near a circle of stones
enclosing a triangle. The head was found on the other side of the
hill.

   The killings linked to an alleged voodoo cult
of drug smugglers appear to be part of mixture of rites with
African and European elements, an anthropologist said Wednesday.
   Although human sacrifices were performed regularly in
pre-Columbian times, ``human ritual slayings are unheard of in
modern Mexico,'' said Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Veracruz Museum of Anthropology in Xalapa.
   ``Animal sacrifices are very common, however, as part of the
widespread superstition and witchcraft that exists in Mexico
nowadays,'' Winfield said in a telephone interview.
   Police in Matamoros, just across the border from Brownsville,
Texas, have uncovered more than a dozen human bodies apparently
used by drug smugglers practicing voodoo rites popularly known as
santeria.
   The smugglers apparently tried to offer the souls of others,
human and animal, to protect themselves from arrest and harm.
   Police had arrested several people and were looking on Wednesday
for the alleged ringleader, a Cuban in his late 40s named Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo.
   U.S. officials say Constanzo apparently introduced elements of
santeria, a Caribbean Hispanic version of voodoo influenced by
Roman Catholicism, to the area.
   Police said the victims' bodies were mutilated and that they
found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones in
the ranch.
   ``I'll have to have more information and maybe look for myself
before I can analyze this further, but from what I saw on
television last night this doesn't seem to be any Mexican occult
ritual,'' said Winfield, who specializes in pre-Hispanic cultures
and their religious influence in modern times.
   ``They seem to be a Russian salad of rites from various satanic
cults which the people indulged in, probably crazed by drugs,'' he
said.
   Winfield said ``lamps'' found at the ranch were actually small
shot glasses blackened with soot and filled with wax, with a wick
stuck in the middle.
   ``These are quite common in Mexican witchcraft and are typical
of the European-Roman Catholic black magic rites inherited from
Europe,'' he said. ``But other elements like the kettles seem part
of the Haitian-African rituals practiced in many places, including
Cuba.''
   Winfield said the African rituals were brought by slaves from
Africa and adapted locally to the Catholic religion. In Brazil it's
known as ``macumbe,'' and in the Hispanic Caribbean, it's called
santeria.
   ``They vary from place to place, but the main elements are
almost all the same,'' Winfield said.
   Santeria is well-known in Florida's Latin community, especially
since 125,000 Cubans immigrated from the Cuban port of Mariel in
1980. Animal rights activists there have complained that
practitioners torture animals and may steal and slaughter pets.
   Santeria priests say animal sacrifice is legal under Florida law
if done humanely. Priests say they kill only chickens, pigs or
goats _ never cats or dogs _ and dispose of remains in a sanitary
manner.
   Southern Florida has dozens of santeria shops, called
``botanicas,'' that sell statues of gods, books of incantations,
colored beads and scents.
   In Mexican marketplaces, herbs and other items are sold for
witchcraft and the work of witch doctors, who are powerful figures
in rural areas where Indians still live much the way they did
before the Spanish came.
   During the Aztec Indian empire and other earlier cultures,
priests sacrificed slaves or prisoners of war to the gods by
cutting their hearts out or flaying or skinning them alive.
   ``Usually this involved a ceremony, usually a fertility rite,''
Winfield said.
   ``In modern Mexico witchcraft is very common and there are two
types _ black magic, which mainly tries to cause harm to an enemy,
and white magic, which seeks to do good like curing a disease,'' he
said.
   ``And, yes ... it is common to sacrifice animals like black
roosters,'' Winfield said.

SALEM TO CELEBRATE 300 YEARS OF WITCHERY

<P>
Here at the scene of the Salem Witch Trials, Halloween is the biggest holiday 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Haunted Happenings, an 11-day annual event, culminates Wednesday when Laurie 
Cabot, Salem's official witch, leads a candlelight procession to Gallows Hill 
where in 1692, 19 men and women were hanged for being witches. 
</P>
<P>
The grim event is marked each year with such events as costume balls, a psychic 
festival, the retelling of mysterious legends in historic homes, and 
spell-casting workshops. 
</P>
<P>
All year long, the drama of those frightful real-life witch trials is 
re-enacted daily with plays recounting the court proceedings and hangings. It 
all happens at the 1845 stone church converted into Salem's Witch Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the Witch Museum. Do you believe in witches? Millions of our 
ancestors did," begins the Witch Museum narrator. 
</P>
<P>
Business is also brisk this week at nearby Crow Haven Corner, a witchcraft shop 
named for the crow-filled pine tree nearby. Crystal balls, books of Tarot, 
magic wands and love potions are selling like hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
"People have come here this Halloween season as always from throughout New 
England," said Alison Damario, Witch Museum education director. "But Salem is 
now preparing for a much greater, worldwide event -- a yearlong solemn and 
dignified commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Witch Trials." 
</P>
<P>
Tercentenary plans call for exhibitions, plays and lectures about Salem's year 
of madness, hysteria and terror. Harvard University will hold a 1992 seminar 
about Increase and Cotton Mather, the father and son Puritan ministers, and the 
roles they played in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
There will be 300th anniversary conferences here on 17th-Century theology, 
witchcraft literature, intolerance, and civil and human rights. An application 
has been made to the Post Office for a Salem Witchcraft Trials commemorative 
stamp. And a statue commemorating the trials has been commissioned. There also 
will be a choral production of "The Crucible," Arthur Miller's play about the 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
Salem will be the site in 1992 of family reunions for descendants of the 19 
persons hanged and of Giles Cory, 80, a convicted witch who was pressed to 
death beneath several tons of rock here. 
</P>
<P>
Essex Institute, founded in 1821 as the official repository for Witchcraft 
Court transcripts, is researching now an exhibit on what life was like here at 
the time of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The logo for the Salem Witch Trials Tercentenary is a gravestone rubbing of a 
face flanked by the dates 1692 and 1992. Salem is a derivative of the Hebrew 
word shalom meaning peace. But there was little peace in Salem in 1692. 
</P>
<P>
The madness began in the parsonage of Samuel Parris. There, Tituba, the family 
slave who was a native of Barbados, used stories of witchcraft to entertain the 
preacher's 9-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and his 11-year-old niece, Abigail 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly, both girls began acting strangely, uttering weird sounds, crawling on 
all fours and barking like dogs, staring blankly into space and writhing with 
convulsive fits. Dr. William Griggs was called to the parsonage and delivered 
his diagnosis: "They are under the spell of witchcraft." 
</P>
<P>
"Who is bewitching you?" demanded Parris. The girls said it was Tituba and two 
women already held in low esteem in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began the infamous inquisition. Before it was over, more than 400 persons 
were accused of being witches, 150 were jailed, 14 women and five men hanged, 
and poor Giles Cory crushed to death. 
</P>
<P>
At least three women and a baby died in prison. Several pregnant women were 
jailed as witches. Among those hanged was the Rev. George Burroughs, a Harvard 
University graduate accused of being a witch. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old girl arrested for being a witch spent more than a year in jail 
before being released. Even a dog was killed for being a witch. The dog's "evil 
eyes" supposedly sent his accusers into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
It was eight girls, aged 9 to 18, and five women who made all of the 
accusations. The entire volume of court testimony was based solely upon 
"spectral evidence" detailed by the accusers. The young girls and women made 
outrageous claims of witches tormenting and torturing them. And they alone were 
witnesses to the witches' work. 
</P>
<P>
The popular image of witches on brooms is derived from trial testimony of 
witches flying through the Salem skies on poles and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
"I am as innocent as the child unborn," Rebecca Nurse, 71, cried out during 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a petition signed by 40 of her neighbors attesting to her exemplary 
character, Nurse was convicted of being a witch and hanged. 
</P>
<P>
Her 17th-Century saltbox home is preserved in Danvers, five miles from Salem. 
Curtis White, 30, has lived in the Nurse home as caretaker for the last six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the house is not haunted by Rebecca's spirit, although some wish it were," 
said White. Danvers is also the site of the Parris church and parsonage where 
the witchcraft hysteria began. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Trask, 43, Danvers town archivist, is a direct descendant of five 
accused of being witches, including John Proctor and Mary Eastey, who were 
hanged. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not unusual around here to have witches on the family tree," allowed 
Trask. 
</P>
<P>
Trask, who also chairs the Danvers Tercentenary Committee, showed a visitor an 
original church record book and opened it to 1692. There, written in the hand 
of preacher Parris, was the first known report of witchcraft that year: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the devil has been raised against us and his rage is vehement and 
terrible and when he shall be silenced the Lord only knows . . ., " wrote 
Parris. 
</P>
<P>
The Danvers Archival Center and Essex Institute are the two best repositories 
of records and information on the Salem Witchcraft madness. Historical novels 
and scholarly books have been published about the event continuously since it 
happened. The interest lingers and, say historians, will not be put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many unsolved mysteries about the accused and the accusers of 
the trials, about so many things involved," said Trask. "That's what gives it 
its mystique. New writers keep showing up re-examining the event, always trying 
to mirror their generation, trying to understand it," he said. "There will 
always be new theories, like the recent one, for example, that contaminated rye 
made the girls hallucinate." 
</P>
<P>
A permanent exhibit of witchcraft at Essex Institute features artists' 
conceptions of three centuries of Salem witchcraft happenings, including the 
events described by the afflicted girls and women. 
</P>
<P>
One display at Essex has a bottle with human finger bones found on Gallows Hill 
(now a city park) in 1900 and a fragment of a coffin dug up there in 1783. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best known residents of present-day Salem is Laurie Cabot, 59, who 
has long black hair streaked with silver and always wears a black robe. In 
1977, when receiving an award from Michael Dukakis for her work with dyslexic 
children, the governor proclaimed her Salem's official witch. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot heads the Witches League for Public Awareness. She also gives psychic 
readings. Her daughter runs the local witchcraft shop. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to Salem to live 22 years ago to remind everyone that what happened in 
1692 had nothing to do with witchcraft. It was pure hysteria, madness," said 
Cabot. 
</P>
<P>
"The Witches League for Public Awareness is not a frivolous fringe group to be 
made light of or ignored. Witchcraft is a legally recognized religion in this 
country, a nature religion. The Earth is our mother." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween, she said, is known to witches as "Samhain" and is celebrated as the 
witches' new year. And where better to spend the holiday, said Cabot, than 
right here in Salem.

<LEADPARA>  Depending on which section of the Wiccan sisterhood grabs your interest,
Tuesday was Beltane, May Eve, Walpurgis Night, Cyntefyn, Roodmass or
Cethsamhain. In Czechoslovakia it was the annual "Burning of the Witches,"
which is why these Prague women put on their rock groupie outfits and went
frolicking on the banks of the Vitava River. In ancient Scotland, Beltane was
the day rents were due and debts settled. . . . We like the Czechoslovak idea

   Is That a Druid Temple in the Back Yard?

   Kent, N.Y. -- Are they root cellars or Druid temples?
   That's the question currently inflaming the intelligentsia
of Putnam County, a rocky chunk of exurbia some 60 miles
north of New York City. Its 247 square miles are home to
83,971 inhabitants and some 200 mysterious stone chambers
that were built either 150 or 3,000 years ago, depending on
who you talk to.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some of the best examples are in the woods off Whangtown
Hollow Road in this little community. And one of the
best-preserved chambers is on the property of longtime
resident John Murray.
   Partially covered by an earthen mound, the chamber is
about 5-foot-8-inches high, 6 feet wide and 15 feet long.
Whoever built it made good use of local materials: Small
rocks are stacked in the carefully balanced arch of a
corbeled vault, three enormous shingled slabs form the roof
and a couple more serve as the doorway and lintel. The
temperature in the chamber feels a good 10 degrees cooler
than outside and the stones drip with moisture. Mr. Murray
refers to the structure as "Dave Kent's root cellar,"
referring to a member of one of the town's leading families.
Members of the Kent Conservation Advisory Commission and the
Kent Historical Society, however, revere it as a Celtic
cathedral.
   Charlie Boyle, whose business card proclaims him an expert
in water dowsing and megalithic research, is in the latter
camp, one of the group that ardently supports the theory that
America was originally colonized by Celtic explorers who
sailed their coracles across the Atlantic in 1500 B.C. By
local legend, the explorers then came up the Hudson River to
mine the iron deposits in what is now Putnam County.
   Believers in the Bronze Age settlement hypothesis quote
Barry Fell, professor emeritus of biology at Harvard and the
author of "Bronze Age America" and "America B.C.: Ancient
Settlers in the New World." Mr. Fell contends that the stone
chambers, menhirs and dolmens are druidic calendrical devices
used to worship the sun. Proof of this, he claims, is that
many of the chambers face either east or southeast, line up
with the sun at the solstices, and contain stones inscribed
in Punic and Iberian scripts and Ogam, the script of the
ancient Irish.
   Mr. Boyle can read Ogam and is able to spot inscriptions
that might elude the untrained eye. At a meeting of the Kent
Historical Society held at Penny Krupman's house on Kentwood
Drive off Whangtown Hollow Road, he holds up a rock that he
stumbled across and speedily translates some scratches into
an enthusiastic, if garbled, proclamation from a sun god.
"This rock is loaded with thought forms," he says. "I call
these megalithic computer chips." "That's interesting,"
ventures Mrs. Krupman. "You bet your life it is," Mr. Boyle
responds.
   James Baker, another resident whose property boasts a
couple of stone chambers, is of two minds on the question of
their origin. He relates how a Fell disciple came to inspect
the caves on Mr. Baker's property and found some markings on
a stone wall that he deciphered as the Ogam for Baal, or Bel,
the sun god. But Mr. Baker, a retired high school history
teacher, admits that he could just as easily see the markings
as an incidental glacial scratch.
   Adding his own ingredient to the brew, Mr. Baker believes
that the stone chambers were simply colonial precursors of
silos and that Dave Kent's root cellar was, in fact, built by
one Moses Mead, a highway commissioner in the first half of
the 19th century who owned a large team of oxen and needed
someplace to store their winter feed.
   Further debunking the believers, Mr. Baker explains that
the eastern and southeastern orientation of the structures is
a function of agricultural necessity: "You do most of the
work in the early morning, so you'd want the light. And you'd
place the opening of the cellar away from the north so that
the roots wouldn't freeze. The fact that some face sunrise at
the winter solstice," Mr. Baker inexorably continues, "is
purely chance."
   But try telling that to Martin Brech. A retired professor
of philosophy, he thinks that the large chambers were used
for religious rituals and the smaller ones for meditation. In
fact, he has meditated in the chambers and he's convinced
that they're something special.
   Mr. Brech camped out in the Celtic cathedral on the night
before winter solstice and had such a powerful experience
that he wrote a two-page, single-spaced poem about it (". . .
nestled below mounded soft-bellied earth/proudly presenting
the mother goddess Womb . . .").
   At dawn the next day, Mr. Brech gathered a group of
people, including Mr. Baker, for a sunrise solstice service.
They sang the Shaker hymn "Tis the Gift to Be Simple" and the
rock anthem "We Are the World" among other songs. They also
chanted the Supreme Mantra from the Heart Sutra of Buddhism
as well as American Indian incantations. One of the
participants, a follower of Wicca, the religion of
witchcraft, brought a drum.
   "He was very helpful," Mr. Brech recalled. "He knew some
of the same chants." Everyone shared hot cider with a little
rum and then, in an informal ritual, put food in each other's
mouth -- trail mix.
   That kind of stuff just makes Ella Townsend snort. "Oh,
yes, says the 83-year-old Kent resident, "and then the drum
roll comes in." Farmers Mills Road, the main Kent
thoroughfare, was dirt when her family moved in in 1921, and
young Ella used to run errands for her father on horseback.
Often when she made her deliveries, farm wives would proudly
show her their stone root cellars stocked with turnips,
potatoes, carrots and even preserved fruits and vegetables.
"Putnam County is very rocky, so you couldn't dig foundations
for a basement," explains Mrs. Townsend. Stone structures,
carefully insulated from the cold and damp by a thick blanket
of dirt and sod, did the trick instead.
   A longtime member of the Kent Historical Society, Mrs.
Townsend was present the evening "two professors came and
gave a knowledgeable talk about these cellars being used for
religious services. Everybody swallowed it and Bobbie {her
friend, Barbara Adams} and I just sat there nudging each
other."
   Now that the weather's more enticing, the woods around
Putnam County are hopping with visitors less skeptical than
Mrs. Townsend and Mrs. Adams. Mr. Brech leads tours for the
curious, on behalf of the Kent Conservation Advisory
Commission. He claims to have attracted as many as 50 people
at a shot.
   Enrique Noguera, who lives across the Hudson River in
Kingston, is also in the guiding biz. He spends a lot of time
in Putnam County on behalf of the Early Sites Preservation
Association, of which he is executive director. Mr. Noguera
leads tours of the cellars as often as twice a month and
charges $25 per person (there's a discount for groups of six
or more). Mr. Brech refuses to accept money; he finds the
notion "subtly corrupting."
   What everyone agrees on, however, is that regardless of
their origin, the stone structures need to be preserved. The
threat is real. These days, it's a lot easier to reach Dave
Kent's root cellar (or Celtic cathedral, as the case may be),
thanks to a road bulldozed in by Ginsberg Development Corp.
"{Samuel} Ginsberg promised that he wouldn't destroy the
site," says Mr. Brech. "Yet he is going to have cluster
zoning there."
   Not if the Kent Conservation Advisory Commission, the Tree
Commission, PLAN Kent (Protecting Land and Nature in Kent)
and the Save Our Lakes political party have anything to do
with it. Rallying round the root cellars, they invoke
history, sanctity and what Mr. Baker calls "the mystery of
the woods."
   Perhaps they -- with a little help from the recession --
are having an effect. Mr. Ginsberg's development plans have
been halted for the time being. And a real estate agent
recently showing some property on nearby White Pond
emphasized its dilapidated stone chamber as a selling point.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Law enforcement journals are describing a
``satanic threat'' in America and seminars on occult crime are
attracting hundreds of police officers in cities across the
country. While some experts insist the threat has been exaggerated,
the Matamoros slayings have rekindled the debate.

   The ritual slayings of 15 people by a
drug-smuggling ring in northern Mexico underscore the need for
police to be trained to recognize the signs of all kinds of occult
crime, according to a growing group of ``cult cops.''
   While the Matamoros slayings apparently had nothing to do with
devil worship, satanism has become a hot topic in law enforcement
circles.
   Law enforcement officials nationwide note an increase in reports
of satanic grafitti, animal mutilations and signs that occult
rituals have taken place. But some say the threat is being
exaggerated.
   Nonetheless, a seminar on satanism and crime sponsored by the
Connecticut State Police last month attracted more than 300 police
officers from all over New England who wanted to learn how to
distinguish serious satanists from teen-age pranksters and how to
respond to each.
   Sober law enforcement journals are running articles describing a
``satanic threat'' and telling police how to spot evidence at crime
scenes that might be overlooked by those unfamiliar with cult
practices.
   Among the new breed of cult cops, sometimes derided as
``ghostbusters'' by their colleagues, is Detective Sgt. Alan L.
Alves of Freetown. Alves has never made an arrest for a satanic
crime and has found no evidence of human sacrifices. But he's
convinced such ritual murders are occurring.
   ``The organized satanists leave absolutely no evidence,'' Alves
says. ``They're killing. That's what they believe in. They have to
make sacrifices. They're killing babies.''
   The Matamoros killings were not related to satanism, according
to Thomas Wedge, a former Union, Ohio, deputy sheriff and the
author of ``The Satan Hunter.'' Wedge makes his living lecturing
about satanism, mainly to law enforcement groups.
   Wedge, reached in Baton Rouge, La., where he was conducting a
seminar for the state police, said the Matamoros killers were
practicing a black magic version of brujeria, an Afro-Caribbean
religion.
   ``This is not an isolated case by any means,'' he said, adding
that he knows of at least one other ritual killing by drug dealers.
   Wedge said brujeria is practiced by many Cuban criminals who
came to the United States on the Mariel boat lift.
   Other experts dispute Wedge's contention that brujeria was to
blame.
   Among them is Robert D. Hicks, a criminal justice analyst for
the state of Virginia, and a former police officer in Tucson,
Ariz., where he had firsthand experience with drug smugglers and
brujeria, which gets its name from the Spanish word for witch _
brujo.
   Brujo, who are found in the Caribbean, Mexico and in Hispanic
communities all over the United States, are witch doctors or wise
men who may also practice some magic, Hicks says, but the vast
majority are peaceful and law-abiding.
   Hicks says the Matamoros killers may have drawn on elements of
the religion to promise their followers magical immunity to
bullets. Or, the cult leaders, including Alfonso de Jesus
Constanzo, a Cuban-American, may have just had an appetite for
blood and wanted to terrorize competitors and police.
   ``In northern Mexico, drug trafficking is intensely
competitive,'' Hicks says. ``Nobody knows at the moment if
Constanzo actually has some deep, abiding faith that pushed him to
commit these crimes, or if he was just a slick operator who made it
up as he went along.''
   Hicks, who is writing a book critical of the ``satanism scare''
in law enforcement circles, says the real danger is that police may
begin trampling on the religious freedoms of those who practice
non-Christian beliefs, even though there is no evidence of
criminality.
   The FBI's chief expert on cult crime, Kenneth V. Lanning, and
other law enforcement officials contacted around the country said
there is no solid evidence that crimes committed by satan
worshipers are on the increase in America.
   ``I question whether there is a true increase,'' says Lanning,
supervisory special agent at the FBI's behavioral sciences unit in
Quantico, Va., who is frequently contacted by local officials
seeking help on cases with cult overtones.
   But Wedge insists satanists have been thriving on police
ignorance and disbelief.
   ``It doesn't really matter what you or I believe,'' Wedge says.
``It's what they believe that's dangerous.''
   Connecticut state police have noticed an increase in the number
of phone callers reporting satanic activity, particularly around
Halloween.
   ``We've only had incidents of things that could be classified as
a bona fide satanic ritual, and those things did not involve any
criminal acts except minor things like criminal trespass or illegal
bonfires,'' says Sgt. Scott O'Mara.

<HEAD>Navajo Culture Central to Hillerman's Books
^With BC-WKD--Hillerman, b0866</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For a mystery writer, there's probably
nothing more mysterious than Navajo culture. Author Tony Hillerman
is fascinated by it, and so, apparently, are his readers.
   Coming off his second straight New York Times best seller,
``Talking God,'' Hillerman continues to examine Indian cultural
themes in ``Coyote Waits,'' due for publication in June.
   A Navajo shaman is a pivotal figure in ``Coyote Waits.'' In
``The Dark Wind,'' the first of Hillerman's books destined for
film, Hopi religion comes into play. In ``Dance Hall of the Dead''
it is Zuni religion. In ``The Blessing Way'' and ``Skinwalkers''
Navajo witchcraft is a central theme.
   Navajo police Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Hillerman's main character, is a
skeptic about witchcraft, but in several books he refers back to
one of his early cases in which he failed to take it seriously and
several people lost their lives.
   In a recent interview, Hillerman said witchcraft is real enough
and common enough to the Navajo. Navajo acquaintances have given
him several anecdotes, but there are many examples in scholarly
literature, as well.
   Hillerman related a story one Navajo once told him about seeing
a witch.
   ``It always takes place in the evening or night,'' Hillerman
said. ``It was shearing time, lambing time, and it was one of those
copper sunsets. Right on the horizon a quarter-mile or so away, he
saw the witch, a skinwalker with the head of a coyote.''
   The boy's grandmother told him to run and get his .22-caliber
rifle, and the youth took a shot at the witch.
   ``I asked him, `Did you hit him, Kenneth?' He said, `Nah, it was
a Navajo .22.'''
   Another anecdote involves an elderly weaver who called in a
crystal gazer to counteract a witch. A Durango, Colo., businessman
and his wife drove the gazer out to the woman's home and watched as
he did his ritual, Hillerman said. Staring into the crystal, the
gazer claimed the witch was a neighbor and had buried something
down the road, presumably to cause her a problem.
   ``The wife sat next to the crystal gazer and got a real strange
look on her face,'' Hillerman said. ``She said, `My God, it was
just like watching television.' She saw the same things in the
crystal that he was describing.''
   Then they went to the spot in the road, and the gazer dug up the
thing.
   ``In the Navajo culture, all goals are toward harmony, being
peaceful, working together. People who turn against this are the
worst kind of people,'' he said.
   Hillerman, who says he has learned most of what he knows about
Navajos from books, has a framed drawing of Navajo ceremonial masks
above his desk. Each mask personifies a yei, or Navajo god. And the
ceremonies and masks continually turn up in his books.
   Kokopelli, the Water Sprinkler, is a key image in ``A Thief of
Time.'' A sacred mask of Talking God kept at the Smithsonian
Institution becomes a lethal weapon in the 1989 novel, ``Talking
God.'' And such rituals as the Blessing Way, the Enemy Way and
others give texture and color to Hillerman's stories, which mix
gentle Navajo traditions with the jarring intrusion of hard-edged
Anglo culture.
   For the latter, the author said, all he needs to do is read the
newspaper.

FOOTLOOSE: THERE'S A BEWITCHING AIR ABOUT OLD SALEM

SALEM, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year 1692 wasn't a particularly good one around here, what with 19 women 
being hanged for witchcraft and the Rev. Cotton Mather throwing fear into much 
of New England with his rampant Puritanism. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler heads finally prevailed when Mather's father, a president of Harvard, 
condemned the practice in a religious tract of 1693. Even the fiery Cotton 
eventually recanted, and things slowly got back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
All of which hasn't kept the Salem police of today from wearing witch shoulder 
patches, a newspaper from displaying a witch on its masthead, taxis from 
emblazoning them on their doors and the high school from making covens of its 
teams by using the old sorceress as a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
From its colorful past, Salem has grown into a lovely and very cultured town, 
give or take a few witch museums. It is the home of native son Nathaniel 
Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables and the spectacular Peabody Museum of 
maritime artifacts and Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
Just a couple of miles down the road is oh-so-affluent Marblehead, one of the 
prettiest of New England's port towns and the self-described "yachting capital 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly United, American, USAir, TWA, Northwest or Continental to 
Boston. From there, it's 30 minutes by commuter rail to Salem. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Allow two or three days for Salem and Marblehead, perhaps 
another couple for visiting fetching towns along the North Shore. Accommodation 
costs are moderate, fine dining the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: June through October are the best and busiest months here, a 
short spring rather bleak, winters only for the hardy. Halloween brings the 
witches back, along with an 11-day "Haunted Happenings" festival that's scary 
and fun. Getting around town is easy with The Hawthorne, a turn-of-the-century 
trolley (complete with history narrators) that stops at all the important 
places. We highly recommend this ride. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hawthorne Hotel (on the Common; $75 to $125 double) is a 
Federalist-style place with 18th-Century furnishings that was built by public 
subscription in the 1920s. Bedrooms are large, serene and have wonderful 
reproductions of period furniture. Choose between the elegant Nathaniel's 
dining room or the Tavern on the Green for your meals, the latter with lighter 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most enchanting inns we've seen lately is Marblehead's The Harbor 
Light Inn (58 Washington St.; $75-$95 B&amp;B double), an 18th-Century home 
meticulously restored, with four-posters, fireplaces, old brasswork, historical 
paintings, etchings and prints. Some rooms have a large private deck and 
Jacuzzi in the bath. There is also a rooftop walk where you may view boats 
coming and going in the harbor and the famed Marblehead Light. 
</P>
<P>
The Stepping Stone Inn (19 Washington Square North; $95-$125 B&amp;B double, 
May through October, $75-$105 March-April and November-December) is next door 
to Salem's Witch Museum and convenient to most of the town's attractions. It's 
an 1846 naval officer's home with eight bedrooms brought up to snuff with 
queen-size beds, original art and homemade quilts on the walls. Full breakfasts 
include such items as eggs Benedict, fine breads and your own silver pot of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You're close to the Atlantic here, and that means 
seafood that locals are almost snobs about, claiming never to have touched 
anything frozen. Cherrystone clams, lobster, halibut, scallops, sole and scrod 
are staples, with clam and fish chowders to get things rolling. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional New England clambake may be difficult to find, so watch the 
papers for church suppers and the like. There is also plenty of good Italian 
food in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Cherrystones (80 Newberry St. off U.S. 1) has every seafood 
imaginable. This is a large and rambling place, with wood floors and old 
Oriental carpets. Many locals have their big night out here. Try the super-rich 
lobster bisque and follow with swordfish grilled, blackened or broiled. There 
are also such dishes as smoked salmon ravioli, lobster and scallops Alfredo. 
</P>
<P>
Chase House (Pickering Wharf) is a great place for lunch right on the river 
leading to the Atlantic. Sit on a deck and feast on scallops and lobster hauled 
right off the boat to the back door. The original Chase House opened in Salem 
in 1872, and the new version is trying to bring back the magic of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
Two Italian restaurants in Marblehead that caught our fancy are Rosalie's (18 
Sewall St.) and Capucino's (40 Atlantic Ave.). Rosalie's features angel hair 
pasta with calamari, tomato, basil and garlic, then broiled swordfish with 
pesto butter. The fettucine melanzane and vitello Milanese also draw raves. The 
decor here is eclectic, with such items as old church pews, a wooden bar, an 
antique hutch and a marble table for serving. 
</P>
<P>
Capucino's recently was voted best Italian restaurant on the North Shore, and 
it should get another accolade for the mounds of food set before you. Choose 
from 11 kinds of veal, 16 pastas and eight seafood dishes, all with a distinct 
Italian accent. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: If you don't know anything about witches when you arrive in Salem, 
you will when you leave. Figuring out which witch house (there are three) to 
start with is your first problem. Try the Witch Museum for starters, then mount 
your broom and go from there. 
</P>
<P>
The Peabody is America's oldest continuously operated museum, housing a 
fascinating collection of ship figureheads, Polynesian masks, carvings, 
pottery, jewelry and textiles from India, Japan, Africa, China and the rest of 
Asia. Don't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
The Essex Institute, a museum housed in six old Salem homes dating to 1684, 
also has a main building with five galleries of furniture, dolls, toys, silver, 
glass, ceramics and military gear tracing the town's 18th and 19th Century 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668 and set in a 
complex of early homes and gardens. If you still have energy in the evening, 
take in a show at the North Shore Music Theater, where Ray Charles, Chita 
Rivera, Harry Belafonte, Jay Leno, Roy Clark and Tammy Wynette perform in 
Broadway musicals and concerts from April through December. It's a first-class 
and very professional operation from curtain to curtain.

   Is Goddess Worship
   Finally Going to Put

   In the beginning, there was no God. There was the Goddess.
She peered into the great void and created the Heaven and the
Earth, and in this new domain women ruled. The world was
peaceful and both sexes worshipped Her.
   But then, about 3,000 B.C., men decided they had a better
idea. They installed male deities -- among them the sun god
Marduk, who did in Tiamat, the mother of all gods, by pumping
air down her throat and blowing her to bits. Things, sadly,
haven't been the same since.

<TEXT>
   Or so say people like Ruth Barrett. Ms. Barrett, who lives
in Los Angeles, is a Goddess worshipper, one of a growing
number of revisionists who believe it's high time to give
credit where credit is due: It was a woman who molded Earth,
argues Ms. Barrett, and it is men -- and their male gods --
who messed it up. "We don't want men to wear dog collars and
be on leashes," she says. "But patriarchy must be put in its
place."
   So it is that Evie-Kaiulani Daufin, a lapsed Catholic, has
found spiritual enlightenment not in church but in the Garden
of the Goddess in Costa Mesa, Calif. On a recent sun-splashed
afternoon, Ms. Daufin, decked out in a grass skirt and bead
necklace in the shape of fallopian tubes and ovaries, joins
five others in the Garden (actually, someone's backyard) for
a fertility rite.
   They giggle as they plunge a 12-foot pole into a hole they
have dug in "Mother Earth." Then Ms. Daufin, a journalism
professor, dances with the other women around the Maypole.
The worshipers include a graying ex-nun who calls herself
Changing Woman. They purify themselves with burnt sage, sing
in a circle, clutch their wombs and beseech the Goddess to
make their lives more fruitful. Their wails reach a feverish
pitch and peak in a primal scream.
   Just another New Age fad? No way, says Judith D. Auerbach,
who studies gender issues at the University of Southern
California's Institute for the Study of Women and Men. "Women
first wanted to apply feminism to political and economic
realms, then to their families," she says. "Now, they want it
in their spiritual lives." Goddess worshipers believe that to
recreate a harmonious world, traits they consider male
(dominance, aggressiveness, competitiveness) must give way to
female "energies" (intuition, nurturing and compassion).
Women should be revered, they say, because they bear
offspring, and are thus linked to nature's cycles.
   "This isn't just God in drag," insists Susan Gitlin-Emmer,
an artist and Goddess worshiper in Reseda, Calif. To her, the
Goddess is earth-bound, represents harmony -- not hierarchy
-- among all living things, and can take on many faces.
Lunaea Weatherstone, who publishes a magazine on pagan
rituals, has fashioned an altar to the Goddess. It bears a
statue of Aphrodite, a crystal penis, purple candles, a
chalice and a shell. It is here, she says, that she worships
the Goddess on solstices, equinoxes and Groundhog Day.
   Goddess worship has been around for a long time, but a
recent spate of academic works on Goddess religions, and
growing debate in traditional faiths about male bias in
theology, has brought in a new wave of believers. Worship
groups -- mostly, but not exclusively, female -- have sprung
up from California to Massachusetts. Now there are Goddess
newsletters, Goddess books, a California Goddess hotline and
a monthly cable-television Goddess show (with host Starr
Goode). Ms. Barrett, a self-described witch, says she gets a
steady stream of students for her year-long course on the
Goddess. One big draw: the introductory lesson in spell
casting.
   In San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Circle of Aradia and
Women Spirit Rising, both worship groups, now stage elaborate
public rituals. During the equinox last fall, 200 women in
Long Beach, some dressed in embroidered robes, others naked,
streamed into a cavernous room lit by candles. One high
priestess, sword in hand, walked in a circle, calling out the
powers of earth, wind, fire and air. "Blessed Be]" the crowd
rejoined.
   Ms. Daufin attended that ceremony. "Women were singing,
wailing, jumping, planting seeds in an urn full of earth,"
she says. As the chanting became frenzied, the priestess
inveighed against rape and child abuse. Exhausted, everyone
fell to the ground.
   Judith Piquet, a Los Angeles actress and masseuse, prefers
a more private "mystery dance" when she prays. She
demonstrates: Standing beside two altars in her bedroom, Ms.
Piquet closes her eyes and sensuously slices the air with her
hands. She begins to breathe heavily. A look of ecstacy comes
over her face and, as her Rubenesque figure quivers, the
dance ends abruptly. "I am trying to dance out the separate
aspects of the Goddess in me," she explains.
   Ms. Piquet says she tried mainstream religions, but felt
they patronized women. "You've got the Father, the Son and
the Holy Ghost. Three men. Not a woman in sight," she says.
Three years ago, she moved into a communal house with four
women who worship the Goddess. "Everything fell into place. I
saw how devalued women had been," says Ms. Piquet. Some of
the women, she says, pray for the time when science will make
men unnecessary for procreation.
   Which isn't to say that all Goddess worshipers are
anti-male. Most worship groups say men merely need
enlightenment, that once they embrace the Goddess they, too,
can find greater glory. But some aren't so sure. To them, men
are "PJ's" short for patriarchal jerks, the font of the
world's ills, a lost cause, beyond redemption. Tempers can
quickly flare: When one Goddess magazine, Sage Woman,
suggested men could join the movement, some of its 3,000
readers canceled their subscriptions in protest.
   Barbara Malcolm, a graduate student at the University of
Southern California, videotaped a ceremony near Los Angeles
that was equally impassioned. The Ocean Amazons were meeting
that day, and the women were sharing war stories about PJ's
they once knew and loved. "Be with us now]" they beseeched
the Goddess. "Help us emerge from our dark traps of
self-doubt."
   They dug a hole in the ground and stuffed it full of
pictures of fashion models torn from magazines -- more male
objectification of women, the Ocean Amazons felt. "I am
incensed by Madison Avenue," seethed one. "Death to the
patriarchy]" she shouted, jamming an ad for liposuction into
the hole. Afterward, the women gazed at themselves in
hand-held mirrors. "I am Goddess," each intoned.
   But men who might feel alienated by all of this can take
heart: A new spiritual movement -- a sort of sexual
counterpoint to Goddess worship -- is gaining favor. This one
is called the "mythopoetic men's movement" and considers
itself a refuge from male-bashing, a place where men can go
to explore their own "gender-spirituality."
   When mythopoetic groups meet, the conversation tends
toward how women exploit men and objectify them as work
objects. The groups explore a masculinity of yore, one they
see as steeped in courage, compassion, fathering and
chivalry. Shepherd Bliss, a San Francisco psychologist,
guides mythopoetic groups into the woods, where they sing
songs, read poetry, revere warrior figures and beat drums.
"We want to recreate the wild man -- someone vital and
fresh," he declares.
   In one recent outing, he says, the men crawled on all
fours, pretending to be animals. They had mud fights, engaged
in bragging contests and urinated together on trees. They
made masks "to allow the primitive side to develop." They
cradled each other and meditated. "We cook for ourselves. We
tell stories. We spend a lot of time weeping," Mr. Bliss
says.
   Sometimes, on the hillsides around Los Angeles, the
spiritual movements meet. On a recent afternoon, a
mythopoetic group beat its drums above Malibu. The 200 men
were searching for lost masculinity and a link to Father
Earth. Their efforts were briefly interrupted, however, when
a group of Goddess worshipers, holding a ritual for Mother
Earth nearby, let go with their primal screams.
   Some of the men were enraged, but not Rick Welt. "There
was a sense of communication, of being whole with the women,
even if it just happened on a psychic level," he says. "It
was the epitome of sacredness in the 1990s."

I was horrified, but not surprised, at Michael Wilmington's review of "The 
Witches" (Aug. 24). The movie revolves around a plot by an organization of 
witches to turn the children of the world into mice. 
</P>
<P>
All the witches in the film are portrayed as ugly and evil old women. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are witches, and we celebrate and worship the Goddess 
(otherwise known as Mother Earth). The golden rule of witchcraft is "An it harm 
none, love, and do as you will." Witches believe that whatever you do, comes 
back to you threefold. Therefore we don't use magic at the expense of others. 
We have been slandered, tortured and burned down the centuries because we do 
not believe in the same God as the church (though we recognize other people's 
right to believe in whatever they like). 
</P>
<P>
"The Witches" is intended to be lighthearted fantasy. But what would 
Wilmington's reaction have been to a lighthearted fantasy called "The Jews" in 
which the Jews of the world were revealed to be ugly, evil people who plot "the 
destruction of every last child in England?"

<HEAD>`High Priestess' of Sex Church Guilty of Prostitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The priestess of the Church of the Most High
Goddess, who wears a red sequin strapless dress and fishnet
stockings, insists sex with hundreds of men is her religious duty,
but a jury says it's prostitution.
   Known as Sabrina Aset to her flock, Mary Ellen Tracy says she
takes part in an ancient, misunderstood Egyptian religion in which
sexual rituals put men on the ``path back to the divine.''
   But a Superior Court jury wasn't convinced, deciding after 3{
days of deliberations Friday that Mrs. Tracy, 46, was no more than a
prostitute working out of a Beverly Hills home that was a thinly
disguised brothel.
   ``I am not a prostitute,'' Mrs. Tracy said after the verdict.
``I'm very hurt by that. I'm a very sincere and honest person. To be
portrayed as some kind of money-grubbing schemer is really
devastating.''
   Jurors convicted her of operating a house of ill fame and two
counts of prostitution. Her husband, Wilbur Tracy, 51, was also
convicted of operating a house of ill fame.
   They face a possible six-month jail sentence and $1,000 fine on
each count when sentenced Thursday by Municipal Court Judge Marion
Obera. The ``church'' had drawn more than 2,000 male followers and
was born of divine inspiration, Mrs. Tracy said.
   The couple have vowed to appeal the misdemeanor convictions,
contending their activities are protected by the First Amendment.
   ``We were found guilty of heresy,'' Wilbur Tracy said.
   The Tracys contend that they worship the oldest religion in the
world, dating back to 3200 B.C. They said aspects of the religion
are found on Egyptian scrolls.
   Once a Mormon, Mrs. Tracy said she was ordained as the high
priestess by her husband in 1984. Wilbur Tracy said he had been
ordained as a high priest that year by a priestess he did not
identify.
   At various times as many as 10 other women acted as priestesses,
all ordained by Wilbur Tracy. The ``church'' is a Spanish-style
rented house near Beverly Hills.
   The sparsely furnished home had no pews or pulpit. The few wall
hangings included posters of movie stars and a framed nude
photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The Tracys advertise in a risque newspaper called the Hollywood
Press, in exchange for a column Mrs. Tracy writes for the paper.
   Men who want to attend the church phone ahead for an interview
with Mrs. Tracy, who decides whether to accept them. She claims to
have turned down many men who were insincere about the spiritual
aspect of the rituals and ``asked for massages and all kinds of
weird things.''
   When the men arrive at the church, they take part in a series of
rituals that include sexual acts with the priestess that Mrs. Tracy
says spiritually cleanses the men.
   ``What he's doing is symbolically giving up ... his very all in
order to have his sins wiped out,'' Mrs. Tracy said.
   The men then leave a ``sacrifice,'' usually money, in a practice
that Mrs. Tracy acknowledged ``gave the police a few problems.''
   Mrs. Tracy said that before she became a high priestess she had
never had sex outside of marriage, but that she has continued to
practice her religion with the help of prayer.
   ``I've always been very willing to do what God required, whether
to be monogamous or to have sex with a few thousand men,'' she said.
``It really doesn't matter. I try to be accepting or open-minded.''

<HEAD>Parents' Complaints About Devil Worship Cancel Halloween Events</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer students in ghost and goblin get-ups
will be parading through the halls of Frederick County schools this
Halloween because of some parents' complaints that the holiday is
linked to devil worship.
   Several schools have canceled traditional Halloween costume
parties, opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations instead.
Other schools are bypassing Halloween altogether, asking children
to dress up as storybook characters in conjunction with National
Children's Book Week in mid-November.
   ``I personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our
instructional curriculum,'' John Thompson, a county school
superintendent, said Wednesday.
   Other parents believe school officials have overreacted to the
15 to 20 parents who complained, Thompson said. But he said school
officials thought the parents had a legitimate concern.
   Larry Chamblin, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of
Education, said that although satanic activities have been brought
to the attention of school officials across the state, he had never
heard of Halloween parties being canceled in any other Maryland
schools.
   In Texas, similar parental complaints have prompted a school
district to considering limiting observance of the holiday, too.
   ``I asked the school board to ban Halloween because it's a
religious holiday,'' Janet Magee, director of children's education
at the 800-member, non-denominational Christian Fellowship Church,
said Wednesday.
   Tuesday night, the Harlingen Consolidated Independent School
District appointed a committee to examine Halloween's role in the
schools. About 200 members of area churches showed up, some wearing
orange anti-Halloween buttons.
   Committee members said they were not ready to decide on whether
to ban Halloween.
   Harlingen school Superintendent T. Carl McMillan said at a
Wednesday morning meeting he advised principals that ``in
situations where they were coming on strong with witches and
witches' brews and all that kind of stuff, perhaps they might want
to tone it down a bit and concentrate on pumpkins and that sort of
thing.''
   ``He agreed to take the yucky stuff out,'' Mrs. Magee said
Wednesday. ``Man, that's a major step.''
   But she wants all Halloween witches, witches' brews, ghosts and
goblins and what she calls ``the dark side'' out of the schools,
and hopes the school board makes the decision at its next meeting.
   ``The Christian religion is not allowed the same privilege in
the schools,'' she said.
   McMillan, however, said Halloween always has been seen as a
spoof of an old superstition.
   ``And kids have always looked on it as a fun time and a spoof
rather than anything serious like this,'' McMillan said.
   Frederick County School Superintendent Noel Farmer has not
issued a policy on Halloween, but at least three elementary schools
_ North Frederick, Walkersville and Hillcrest _ have discontinued
Halloween events. Others have changed the focus of the parties.
   Middletown Elementary School Principal Roy Clever said some
parents keep their children home from school to prevent them from
participating in Halloween parties. To keep the children in class,
the school decided to hold a fall celebration instead.
   ``We've requested that the students not come as witches and
goblins and ghoulish characters,'' he said.

   In Turin, Italy, the Roman Catholic Church has
six official exorcists to cast out demons. Magicians, seers, faith
healers, mind readers, astrologers and others dabbling in the
occult advertise regularly on television. Has Satan established a
stronghold in the ancient city famous for its religious icons?
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real or imagined, the devil is tormenting
this sober industrial city in northwestern Italy.
   Some believe a sinister presence lurks in the shadows along the
city's broad, arcaded boulevards and haunts the medieval squares in
the nearby mountain hamlets of the Piedmontese Alps.
   The city likes to be remembered as the former seat of the House
of Savoy dynasty, the first capital of a unified Italy, the resting
place of saints and religious relics, the home of the Fiat auto
empire.
   It's also the home of the Shroud of Turin, which some believe
was the cloth with which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of
Jesus Christ after his crucifixion.
   But Turin has a darker reputation as a haven for Satan and his
disciples.
   There is no proof, of course. But what is certain is that the
city has six official exorcists, an underground core of devil
worshipers and thousands of people dealing in the occult.
   Specialists in the occult maintain that Turin forms part of two
``magic'' triangles representing good and evil.
   Along with Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Lyon, France, the city is
reputedly a center of ``white magic,'' a positive force. Turin is
also said to join London and San Francisco as a stronghold of
``black magic,'' which is considered harmful or diabolic.
   ``Turin has always been a place of great spiritual and magical
ferment,'' says Giuditta Dembech, a journalist and author of the
book ``Torino: Citta Magica'' (Turin: Magic City). ``It has some of
the qualities of places like Mecca, Jerusalem and Lourdes.''
   The city first attracted widespread notoriety as a devil's
playground four years ago when Turin's archbishop at the time,
Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, appointed six official exorcists.
   Exorcism, the process of casting out demons, is an accepted
practice in the Catholic Church. Pope John Paul II has frequently
stated that the devil is a pervasive reality in today's world.
   The naming of the six exorcists in Turin followed a directive
from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for churches to
exercise greater control over exorcisms.
   ``Unfortunately some of our priests had gone a little too far
and were performing exorcisms too hastily,'' says Canon Giuseppe
Ruata, who heads Turin's pool of official exorcists.
   Two events in 1988 further contributed to the city's satanic
image.
   First, the pope spoke of the devil during a visit to Turin,
saying: ``From the history of salvation, we know that where there
are saints there is also another person who presents himself not by
his name but the name of others. He is called the prince of this
world, the demon.''
   Then, a month later, Turin hosted a weeklong conference on
demonology that bitterly divided local politicians, churchmen and
academics.
   Church officials deny Turin has a greater problem with the devil
than any other cities, pointing out that Milan tops Italy with
eight exorcists of its own. Milan has a population of 1.5 million,
compared with Turin's 1 million.
   ``Turin has an image it doesn't deserve,'' Ruata, 74, said in an
interview at the archdiocesan offices. ``I wouldn't make Turin out
to be the capital of the demonic empire.''
   Most agree, however, that Turin has an unusually high number of
magicians, seers, faith healers, mind readers, astrologers and
others dabbling in superstition and witchcraft. They advertise
continuously on private television and radio.
   ``There are more than 100 of these types of agencies in Turin,''
Ruata says. ``They charge $400 as the initial fee for removing a
spell. It's a huge form of trickery.''

   MOVING TECHNICAL WORKERS away from big cities can be difficult. 

   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I., recently failed to persuade several data processing executives to move to a new center in Florence, S.C. 
Some companies lose a third of their senior technical people in such moves, says Edward Perlin Associates, a consultant. 

   Planning helped PaineWebber Group Inc., which lost only 1% of a group of technical workers instead of the 50% it feared when moving the employees to New Jersey from New York. 
The company granted one-time 10% salary bonuses and operates its own commuter vans. 
When Equitable Life Assurance Society moved data processing workers to Leonia, N.J., from New York, it offered cut-rate mortgages and flexible work schedules. 
Everyone moved. 

   Senior staffers may refuse to move because they have many options in the job market and their families have community ties, Perlin says. 

   MORE "RABBI TRUSTS" were used to safeguard deferred pay last year. 

   The trusts, so named because a synagogue first came up with the idea, began gaining favor in 1986 when managers became worried their benefits could be jeopardized by hostile takeovers. 
Some 63 major companies now offer them, up from 17 in 1986, says Hewitt Associates, consultants. 

   But there's still some risk for executives. 
Creditors can claim the money held in rabbi trusts after a bankruptcy. 
So along came so-called secular trust funds, which can't be tapped by creditors. 
Unlike in a rabbi trust, an employer's contributions to a secular trust and the trust's earnings are taxable income immediately for the employee. 
But companies often subsidize this tax bite. 

   DOCTORS DEBATE whether residents' long work hours affect patient care. 

   In the wake of a New York teen-ager's death after her late-night admission to a hospital, some physicians responsible for training doctors argue that long hours aren't to blame for mistakes. 
Others agree with studies saying that limiting residents to 80-hour weekly service would reduce stress. 
The now-average 100 weekly hours are traditional, and some doctors deem them necessary to learn the course of a disease. 

   Nursing shortages and poorly trained graduates of foreign medical schools are more important causes of inadequate patient care, Dr. Norman Levinsky of Boston University Medical Center writes in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
States should provide funds for extra staff, argues Dr. Robert Glickman of Columbia University. 

   City hospitals need different staffing solutions than those with few evening admissions, doctors agree. 

   MANUFACTURERS AND MBA students will discuss careers during a University of Chicago Business School conference in April. 
Black Monday means fewer MBA grads seek Wall Street jobs, but many still fear that manufacturing concerns offer slow advancement. 
Richard Thain, the school's dean, says it is a shame to see MBAs with technical backgrounds selling bonds rather than working for manufacturers. 

   NEW PAY SYSTEMS such as gain sharing -- distributing companywide bonuses based on productivity growth -- are popular with employees when they emphasize both managers and workers' roles, says a study of 425 concerns by Hay Group consultants. 
But systems aimed only at cost-cutting, such as two-tier pay plans, fail to win favor. 

   QUALITY BOARDS: The number of companies whose directors include chief executive or chief operating officers of other firms has risen to 83% from 74% in the past year, says the annual study of boards by Korn/Ferry International, consultants. 
Directors' average compensation is $25,720, including committee fees. 

   CHILD-CARE AID is offered by only 12 states, says a study of state employee benefits for 1988 by Workplace Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based labor analysis firm. 
Forty-four states grant unpaid maternity leave, while 31 provide unpaid paternity leave. 
Many states said their workers are allowed to use paid vacation and sick leave time for parental leave. 

   WOMEN INCREASE their numbers and reputations as salespeople. 

   Dow Chemical Co.'s industrial sales staff is 15% women, up from 10% five years ago. 
American National Insurance Co., Galveston, Texas, doubled the saleswomen it employs in the same period. 
McCormick &amp; Co. of Hunt Valley, Md., says women account for 29% of its sales force, compared with 15% in 1985. 
A McCormick vice president attributes women's gains at the company to "a deep-rooted work ethic and a strong desire for success." 

   About 20% of all new hires in non-retail sales are women, says a survey by Sales Consultants, a division of Cleveland-based Management Recruiters International. 
Survey respondents claimed saleswomen have more of a work ethic than salesmen and offer clients more service, says Alan Schonberg, Sales Consultants' president. 

   Some executives say there aren't any sex-based differences among good salespeople. 
"You just have to be tough and smart," a Dow official says. 

   THE CHECKOFF: Democratic presidential candidates Dukakis and Jackson both were favored over Vice President Bush in a Communications Workers of America poll. . . . 
A Canadian priest in the religion of Wicca, or witchcraft, must be given religious holidays off, an arbitration board rules in Ontario.

<HEAD>23 Polynesians Convicted in Religious Witch-Hunt Murders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PAPEETE, French Polynesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted 23 residents
of a South Pacific atoll who claimed they were swept up by demons
or religious frenzy when they tortured to death six people during a
witch hunt.
   The seven-man, two-woman jury at the Tribunal of Papeete handed
down penalties late Thursday that ranged from three to 14 years
imprisonment for those who participated in the 1987 slayings.
   ``I find these penalties very heavy,'' said Roman Catholic
Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the highest-ranking church official
in French Polynesia. ``The repentance of the accused is sincere.''
   The defendants, mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of
Faaite, showed no reaction when the sentences were read. Another
suspect, a minor, will be judged in a separate proceeding.
   The 14-year sentence went to farmer Francois Mauti, 25, on
convictions of murder, complicity in murder and inflicting mortal
blows. He led a band of disciples that organized the violence in
Sept. 2-4, 1987.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' Mauti told
Judge Marcel Bihl. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   During the nine-day trial, the court heard defendants speak of
being swept away by evil spirits or religious enthusiasm as they
hunted down and killed neighbors they thought were possessed.
   The terror had roots in August 1987 visit by three women who
arrived from Tahiti, 300 miles to the west. The women claimed to
represent the Roman Catholic-affiliated movement Christian Renewal,
a group founded in the United States. Church authorities deny they
had any official role in the movement.
   The group already had a strong following on Faaite, a sandy
atoll where about 180 people live. The women, regarded as
``priestesses'' by the islanders, took over the community's
whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the religious
authority.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   Miss Silvia suggested demons were in their midst, defendants
said, and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow
islanders who failed to attend her daily services.
   ``My words were misinterpreted,'' testified Silvia, a
55-year-old dental secretary who was not charged. ``I only gave
prayers that cured those who were sick.''
   But the defendants said the mood of the once-placid atoll swung
between ecstasy and dread inspired by Silvia and her assistants.
The trio left Faaite in late August and anointed seven disciples to
continue their work.
   A few days later, a 14-year-old boy reported a vision that the
devil had possessed his aunt. The islanders gathered in nightlong
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised.
   They repeated the ritual with two other people. But Ioane
Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly denounced the women on Sept.
2. Maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck, beat and
drowned him, and threw his body on a bonfire built before the
church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one defendant said. ``It was
necessary to purify the village.''
   Five more people were killed over the next two days.
   Most islanders took no part in the carnage, but it was Sept. 4
before anyone established contact with Papeete, the capital of
French Polynesia, and reported trouble on the atoll.
   The mayor, who had been on vacation, and a Roman Catholic priest
arrived the next day with police.
   Psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic
Christianity, mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the
supernatural, produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated
island lacking institutional authority. The three visitors were not
put on trial because they left Faaite before the murders.

   A witch doctor from an indigenous
religious cult announced his candidacy for Venezuela's presidential
election by proclaiming himself the envoy of a local goddess.
   Romulo Abreu Duarte, 52, used drums, the chanting of spells and
two altars to Indian goddess Maria Lionza when he presented himself
Monday to election officials as a candidate of the Venezuelan
Orienting Spiritual Force.
   ``This is a 100 percent spiritual vote and the only one capable
of breaking up the two-party system in the queen Maria Lionza. I am
her envoy so that this mission is fulfilled,'' said Abreu.
   The witch doctor, clad in a business suit and a manatee-tooth
necklace, told reporters, supporters and onlookers that his
decision to run in the December presidential election began with a
revelation that came in a dream.
   The Maria Lionza cult is a mixture of nature-worship, witchcraft
and Catholicism which has thousands of followers in Venezuela who
look toward the legendary Indian chief's daughter for help in
solving problems.

   As the Christmas holiday approaches and government offices
everywhere struggle with the delicacies of extending neutral
"Season's Greetings," it is worth remembering how intrusive
the official voice of spiritual governance used to be. In the
Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, the Declaration of Rights
established it to be the "right as well as duty of all men in
Society, publicly, and at stated seasons, to worship the
Supreme Being, the great creator, and preserver of the
universe." Although every man was free to worship in his own
"season," still -- worship he must. The intent of the
legislature was clear: to promote Christian reverence and
piety among their constituents.
   Amid the proliferating trends of the 1990s, there are
signs that the crusade to reinstate the church into public
life is making a quiet, insidious comeback. Chief among the
suspect symptoms is the Supreme Court's willingness to hear a
case potentially challenging the way in which boundaries of
our secular autonomy are defined. In Lee v. Weisman, heard by
the court this fall, the nine justices were asked to
determine whether the invocation of God's name at a
public-school commencement exercise violated a student's
First Amendment right to be free of state-established
religion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The court has not handed down its decision yet -- and may
not until as late as next summer. But some already fear that
the reasoning governing the decision will portend the
beginning of the end of religious noninterference.
   Since 1971, when the court decided Lemon v. Kurtzman,
judges have been using the same test to determine whether the
intent of the Founders of the Constitution to have Congress
"make no laws establishing religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof," was being respected. The Lemon test, as it
has come to be known, mandates a three-pronged investigation
to discern whether a publicly ordained practice has a
legitimate secular purpose, advances or inhibits religion as
its principal primary effect, or fosters an excessive
governmental-religious entanglement. For more than 20 years,
the Lemon test has protected school children from chanting
prayers, atheists from taking religious vows, Seventh-Day
Adventists from working on the Sabbath, Christian Scientists
from receiving unwanted medical treatment, and non-Christians
from seeing creches spring out of their town halls.
   While not asking the court to overturn any of these
landmark decisions, the Bush administration did call on
justices to abandon the Lemon test, and reintroduce a "civic
acknowledgement of religion in public life." Under this new
test, religious practices would be allowed to proceed absent
proof of direct or indirect governmental coercion of
religious non-adherents. Some minor entanglements of church
and state, such as having the word of God ("in whom we
trust,") appear on our coins, or an ordained chaplain invoke
the name of God in his opening prayer to Congress, have long
been accepted as relatively innocuous departures from the
formal proscription against establishment.
   But while such "deeply embedded practices" (as they were
described by the Supreme Court in Marsh v. Chambers in 1983)
may serve the legitimately secular purpose of "solemnizing
public occasions" (as decided in 1989, County of Allegheny v.
ACLU), having school children at publicly funded commencement
services suffer through unwanted religious benedictions
serves no such end.
   If the Supreme Court rules to adopt such a test, it alone
cannot be blamed for infusing a newly religious tone into its
rulemaking. Some citizens are intent on inducing Solomonic
decisions from the justices on the most ethically fraught,
spiritually sensitive issues of the times. The conservative
sweep among religious fundamentalists, the sectarian wrath of
pro-choice lobbyists, even the mounting appeal of such
radical politicians as David Duke, all speak in favor of one
thing: substituting the voice of spiritual guide, or God, as
it were, for that of law.
   What explains this hunger for officially sanctioned
spiritual guidance? A look to the Puritanic past of the
country reveals clues. Then, as now, there was a burgeoning
sense of religiousness in the land. Just as people today are
spread out, often too diverse in cultural backgrounds to
share a common understanding of ethos, then too the
proliferation of hostile sects prevented a holistic community
from developing. As a result, local boards in effect became
moral surrogates for the people. These boards provided not
only positive spiritual guidance but also an atmosphere of
moralizing paranoia that ultimately lent legitimacy to the
practice of witch hunts.
   At the famous trial of Anne Hutchinson, the suspected
heretic, in 1637, the threat of nonconformism raised by her
novel interpretations of the faith-works controversy even
spurred the governor of Massachusetts to interfere. Although
he acknowledged the difference between civil and church law,
the governor nonetheless insisted that his right to intercede
rested on the state's having established the religion to
which Hutchinson was now expected to conform. He aligned
himself with the reigning Puritan minister of the community,
who preached the virtues of the "Covenant of Works" as the
only sure means of salvation. The governor claimed that God
had willed him to use civil means to effect church ways, and
subsequently voted to banish and excommunicate Hutchinson
from the Massachusetts colony. Much like the abortion-seekers
of tomorrow, Hutchinson was consigned to pursue freedom
across the state lines.
   While we have certainly improved in erecting a more
impermeable divide between church and state since Colonial
times, there are signs that government's efforts to infuse a
religious tone into the reading of our Constitution's
establishment clause are becoming more open, more aggressive.
   In the midst of a newly awakened movement toward religious
governance, the public has shown itself passively
acquiescent. Perhaps, contrary to the days of Puritanism, it
is the dearth of spiritual guidance in their own homes that
explains the compliance. Soaring poverty rates, the advent of
working mothers, increased racial and ethnic polarization of
neighborhoods and the fading autonomy of the local church
have all contributed to a lack of moral influence in the
home, especially for children. Pathetically, laws
establishing religious parameters of conduct may become the
new moral surrogate for some families in the 1990s.
   Exactly what may come of this misguided substitution of
assigned roles -- jurist as spiritual mentor, legislator as
itinerant preacher -- is yet unknown. Lee v. Weisman could be
the harbinger of a phenomenon whereby citizens defer to
officials the role of religious guide and spiritual mentor.
As in the Colonial era, deciding when government crosses the
proper lineand doing something about it -- could pose the
biggest challenge to our democracy in the 21st century.

   A jury convicted and sentenced
to prison 23 islanders for torturing and burning to death six
people in a frenzied witch hunt that terrorized their tiny atoll in
the South Pacific.
   The seven-man, two-woman jury at the Tribunal of Papeete handed
down the penalties late Thursday. They ranged from three to 14
years imprisonment for those who particiapted in the 1987 slayings.
Prosecutor Raymond Morey had recommended penalties ranging from
five to 20 years.
   The defendants, mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of
Faaite, showed no reaction when the sentences were read. Another
suspect, a minor, will be judged in a separate proceeding.
   ``I find these penalties very heavy,'' said Roman Catholic
Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the highest-ranking church official
in French Polynesia. ``The repentance of the accused is sincere.''
   The heaviest sentence, 14 years, went to farmer Francois Mauti,
25, on convictions of murder, complicity in murder and inflicting
mortal blows. He led a band of disciples that organized the
violence in Sept. 2-4, 1987.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' Mauti told
Judge Marcel Bihl. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   During the nine-day trial, the court heard defendants speak of
being swept away by demons or religious frenzy as they hunted down
and killed neighbors they thought were possessed.
   The terror had roots in August 1987 visit by three women who
arrived from Tahiti, 300 miles to the west. The women claimed to
represent the Roman Catholic-affiliated movement Christian Renewal,
but church authorities deny they had any official role in the
movement.
   The group already had a strong following on Faaite, a sunny
atoll of white sand that is home to about 180 people. The women,
regarded as ``priestesses'' by the islanders, took over the
community's whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the
religious authority.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   Miss Silvia suggested demons were in their midst, defendants
said, and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow
islanders who failed to attend her daily services.
   ``My words were misinterpreted,'' testified Silvia, a
55-year-old dental secretary who was not charged. ``I only gave
prayers that cured those who were sick.''
   But the defendants said the mood of the once-placid atoll swung
between ecstasy and dread inspired by Silvia and her assistants.
The trio left Faaite in late August and anointed seven disciples to
continue their work.
   A few days later, a 14-year-old boy reported a vision that the
devil had possessed his aunt. The islanders gathered in nightlong
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised.
   They repeated the ritual with two other people. But Ioane
Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly denounced the women on Sept.
2. Maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck, beat and
drowned him, and threw his body on a bonfire built before the
church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one defendant said. ``It was

   Five more people were killed over the next two days.
   Most islanders took no part in the carnage, but it was Sept. 4
before anyone established contact with Papeete, the capital of
French Polynesia, and reported trouble on the atoll.
   The mayor, who had been on vacation, and a Roman Catholic priest
arrived the next day with police, in time to prevent four more
executions.
   Psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic
Christianity, mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the
supernatural, produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated
island lacking institutional authority. The three women were not
put on trial since they had left Faaite before the murders.

JUDGE REJECTS CLAIMS OF THE SEX CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A religious group that claimed to absolve the sins of male worshipers by sexual 
intercourse with a female priestess is nothing more than a scam intended to 
hide the operation of a brothel, a federal judge said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne Jr. rejected arguments by Will and Mary 
Ellen Tracy of Canyon Country, who filed a civil suit to prevent the Los 
Angeles Police Department and city attorney's office from investigating or 
prosecuting their Church of the Most High Goddess. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys, convicted of prostitution charges last September, said U.S. 
constitutional guarantees protect the practice of what they claimed were 
ancient religious rites. 
</P>
<P>
During six days of testimony, Will Tracy, 52, said he received a revelation 
from God in 1984 to re-establish a religion he says was practiced in ancient 
Egypt. According to the revelation, his wife was required to have sex with 
1,000 men to achieve her status as high priestess of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that their testimony is incredible," Byrne said in his ruling. "The 
religion had really no basis to it other than sexual conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Male worshipers were required to make donations of cash or services to the 
church to participate in the rituals. The Tracys, who acted as their own 
attorneys, called the donations religious sacrifices. They said they received 
about $50,000 in donations in three years while operating the church in houses 
in West Los Angeles and Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The issue before the court, Byrne said, was not whether the religion exists. 
But he could rule, the judge said, on whether the Tracys exhibited a sincere 
belief in the doctrine they preached. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that each of the plaintiffs does not have a sincere belief," he said, 
calling the church "nothing but a shield" to protect the couple from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne noted that Mary Ellen Tracy, 47, ran ads in sexually explicit newspapers 
saying, "I love sex," and soliciting men for "hedonistic" rites. The couple 
said the ads merely expressed Mary Ellen Tracy's open attitude toward sex. 
</P>
<P>
"We find nothing wrong with sex," Will Tracy said. "Sex is a gift from God." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne also said that even if the Tracys were sincere in their beliefs -- and he 
conceded that was a possibility -- there is a compelling public interest to 
control such activities, regardless of the religious intent. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling against two Indian drug counselors 
who were fired from their jobs after admitting they had taken peyote in what 
they said were ancient religious rituals. The court held that the Constitution 
does not permit people to break the law in the name of religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Will Tracy said: "This means there is no religious 
defense in federal court." He called the judge's ruling "appalling" and 
promised to appeal.

<TEXT>     Unitarians are more likely to be divorced than are members of other
religious groups.;    And despite all the attention given to what devotees
call the New Age -- a spiritual movement that combines mysticism, psychology
and holistic healing -- the number of adherents, 28,000, is practically
insignificant.;    These findings are from a poll on religious affiliation
that surveyed 113,000 people around the nation, the largest and most
comprehensive effort to draw a portrait of religion in America.;    The
survey, commissioned by the Graduate School of the City University of New
York, confirms that the country is broadly religious and widely diverse, with
more than nine in 10 Americans identifying with one of a myriad of
denominations, from Presbyterian to Rastafarian.;    The survey also shows
regional and racial variations. For example, people in the Western states are
almost twice as likely to have no religion than people in the rest of the
country. The 17 percent of Oregon respondents who said they had no religious
affiliation were the largest such group of any state.;    Every 10 years the
Census Bureau asks Americans their income, their race and even how many
bathrooms they have. But fear of church-state entanglement has kept any
question about religion off the census questionnaire.;    That makes the City
University survey particularly valuable, other poll takers and sociologists
said. Martin Marty, a religion scholar on the faculty at the University of
Chicago, said that before this survey, knowledge of Americans' religious
beliefs had come from the denominations themselves or from much smaller
national polls that only provided a very broad picture of affiliation.;   
Marty said the data confirmed what already was known about larger religious
groups and provided previously unknown details about smaller ones.;    The
survey found that while 86.5 percent of Americans, or 214 million people, are
Christians, they identify in dozens of groups.;    Roman Catholics make up the
largest of these, with 26 percent of the nation's population, followed by
Baptists, Methodists and Lutherans, respectively. Jews are less than 2 percent
of the population, and Muslims are 0.5 percent.;    90% say they're religious;
 Even though these broad outlines were known before, Marty said he still
considered it "astonishing that in a high-tech, highly affluent nation, we
have 90 percent who identify" themselves as religious. "If such a poll were
done in Western Europe, the ancestral home of many Americans, you would run at
least a third or lower on every indicator," he said.;    Marty said he was not
surprised at the relatively low number of practitioners of Eastern or New Age
religions.;    "The exotic always catches the eye," he said. "But for most
Americans, they are fascinating things that they can pick up or drop but don't
change the level of commitment.";    Several of the surprises in the poll
shattered stereotypes about ethnic groups. After finding that most Americans
of Irish ancestry are not Catholic, the researchers speculated that this was
because so many are descended from Protestants from Northern Ireland and
others are the products of interdenominational marriages.;    The survey also
found that most Asian-Americans and most Arab-Americans are Christian, rather
than Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim. The authors said Christians from Arab and
Asian countries are more likely to emigrate to the United States.;    Finally,
the survey looked at marriage in light of religious affiliation. People
without a religious affiliation, it found, are least likely to marry.;    But
it found that the likelihood of being divorced is generally uniform across all
religious groups. Roman Catholics, with 7.5 percent currently divorced, are
only slightly lower than other mainstream Protestant and Jews, with 8.7
percent divorced. The Greek Orthodox have the lowest level of divorce (4.4
percent) and the Unitarians the highest (18 percent).;    Other findings; 
Among other findings:;    (check) Jews, with 1.8 percent (or 4.3 million
people), are the largest non-Christian faith represented. While a recent
estimate by the Council of Jewish Federations put the number of Jews at 5.5
million, the City University researchers did not include those who identify
culturally as Jews but not religiously.;    (check) The finding that Muslims
represent 0.5 percent of the U.S. population (or 1.4 million people) is also
less than previous estimates, which put the Muslim population at 3 million to
6 million. The difference might have to do with Christians from Arab countries
who identify culturally with the Muslim community but not religiously, the
pollsters speculated.;    (check) Of the nation's Muslims, 40 percent are
black, though less than 2 percent of the total black population is Muslim.;   
(check) The number of Buddhists (one million) and Hindus (500,000) was larger
than earlier estimates. Among smaller groups with fewer than 50,000 members
were, in descending order of size, Bahai, Taoist, Rastafarians and Wiccan.;   
The data were collected through telephone interviews with 113,000 adults from
April 1989 to April 1990 by the ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., on
behalf of the Graduate School of the City University. The margin of sampling
error for the nationwide statistics is less than one percentage point in
either direction.; CHART: Religion in America: Snapshots; From a telephone

   The King of the Witches for 25 years is dead and
his designated heir has fled.
   So the Witchcraft Council of Elders, which claims 100,000
members in Britain and thousands of adherents worldwide, voted
unanimously not to pick a successor.
   Alex Sanders was the first formal King of the Witches in about
500 years, said council spokesman, High Priest Nigel Bourne.
   The witch king, who died earlier this month at age 61, decreed
in a tape recording played at his funeral that his 16-year-old son,
Victor, should succeed him as king, said his widow, Maxine.
   But his son apparently has no interest in the job and has gone
to live with friends in the United States, she said.
   In any case, she suggested, perhaps a king is no longer needed.
The Council of Elders voted to that effect Thursday night.
   ``In the old days you had a king of witches because the crops
wouldn't grow, because the country was in danger or at war, or
something like that,'' she said.
   ``After a period of seven years he would be sacrificed. In
modern times we don't sacrifice them, but nobody in their right
mind wants the job. ... It is not necessary at this time. The crops
are doing very nicely, the babies are doing nicely.''
   The Sanders family clearly regard their brand of witchcraft as
the white, or benevolent, sort.
   Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative member of Parliament, told the
House of Commons last month that he believed witchcraft was
sweeping the country and endangering children. He said many people
convicted of offenses against children had been involved in
witchcraft initiation ceremonies.

FOR THOSE WHO FEAR FRIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERSTITION: FRIDAY THE 13TH IS TOMORROW, BUT FEAR NOT. A NORTHRIDGE CLASS 
TEACHES THAT 13'S BAD REPUTATION IS UNFOUNDED.

Thirteen is one of the scariest numbers, but when it lands on a Friday it is 
considered the unluckiest of days and is enough to keep people home. But a 
Northridge numerologist is trying to ease fears about the odd number by 
teaching a class just after this month's Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
"The number 13 is my favorite number," said Freda Amsel, wearing a necklace 
with the number 13. "It always turns up in my life and has always meant good 
things for me." 
</P>
<P>
She was born on the 13th, and often flies on that date, requesting row 13 on 
the plane. The names of her three sons -- whom she had well before she 
discovered numerology -- all add up to 13 when translated into numerological 
terms. The addresses of homes significant in her life -- her house of birth, 
first homes in New York and California, the home of her divorce and her present 
home -- all add up to 13. And this year is significant because Amsel turns 58 
(5 + 8 = 13). 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the 13 denotes a negative connotation I hope people will see its 
positive side," Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
But the superstitious may be delighted to know that this month's Friday the 
13th is the last one until September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge professor Eloise Klein Healy, an expert and author about 
mythology and legends, said the fear of 13 has always been associated with the 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it has been considered an extremely dangerous number," said 
Healy, an English professor. "There are 13 witches in a coven, so it is 
associated with witches. It is affiliated with an outside religion and the 
magic of numbers. In history, people were afraid of the number 13 because they 
feared anything magical -- like black magic. Look was happened to witches." 
</P>
<P>
Numerology is the study of positive and negative vibrations of numbers, made up 
by names and birth dates; a person choses to follow the vibrations for good or 
evil, Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
Amsel teaches her class at the Cosmic Connection Metaphysical Bookstore and 
Academy in Northridge, where owner Charlene Whitaker has read Tarot cards and 
astrology charts for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"The number 13 got a bad reputation because of this," Whitaker said, flipping 
out the "Death Card" from her Tarot deck -- cards used as an ancient form of 
fortune telling. The number 13 is on the card with a grotesque skeleton and a 
rising sun in the background. "This was never meant to be death as we know it, 
but transformation. It's about destroying the old and making room for the new." 
That, coupled with the death of Jesus Christ on a Friday made the combination 
ominous. He was the 13th one at the dinner table, Amsel pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wake up thinking it is Friday the 13th and bad things are going to 
happen, then we look for bad things to happen," Whitaker said. "Thought creates 
form." 
</P>
<P>
But 13 was very lucky for 13 bank employees in Clearwater, Fla., who bet $13 in 
the lottery on the Friday the 13th in April and won $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other significant 13s: 
</P>
<P>
* The "baker's dozen" in Europe means if you order a dozen, you get 13. 
Historically, it relates to 12 months of growing and harvesting crops and the 
13th is a new beginning of sharing. 
</P>
<P>
* The New York Stock Exchange and many hotels and office buildings have no 13th 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
* At 13, Jewish children become adults in bar mitzvahs or bas mitzvahs, another 
transformation, Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many misconceptions about 13 and the fears are passed on from 
generation to generation," Whitaker said. "People consider it fatalistic, until 
they learn more about it." 
</P>
<P>
The New Age philosophy of the late 1980s has peaked and people put the 
metaphysical stuff they learned to everyday practice, said Whitaker, who has 
classes at her bookstore in tea-leaf readings, crystals, self-healing, 
spiritual development and meditation. Her brightly lighted, incense-scented 
store doesn't carry materials about voodoo, black magic, satanism or 
witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"A good psychic reminds you of who you are and what your values and priorities 
should be, thereby releasing you of fear and worry," Amsel said. "Freed from 
your anxieties, you will be open-minded to directing your own course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Her classes are a bit of a history lesson. "In my class everyone is curious 
about the number 13 and even the most skeptical is fascinated by the 
information on the dollar bill," Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
She pulls out a dollar bill and points to the 13 rows of bricks on the pyramid, 
a symbol from the secret group of Freemasons that included George Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, as cited in "The Seal of the United 
States" by Paul Foster Case. The phrases "Annuit Coeptis" (He favors our 
undertaking) and "E pluribus unum" (From many, one) have 13 letters, the eagle 
carries 13 arrows in his left talon and the peace branch has 13 leaves and 13 
olives, according to Case's book. Although the country had 13 colonies to begin 
with, Amsel said the symbols are for a more spiritual purpose. 
</P>
<P>
(Amsel's next class on "The Mystery of Numbers" is scheduled at 7 p.m. July 25 
at the Cosmic Connection, 9250 Reseda Blvd. Admission is $10.) 
</P>
<P>
"The number is all or nothing at all," Amsel said. "You can make it have 
enormous potential for attainment or complete destruction, but it is up to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"Friday the 13th should be thought of like any other day," Whitaker added.

CHRISTIAN POLICE SERGEANT SEES SATAN AS AN ADVERSARY IN CRIME 
</P>

First came the 18-year-old La Puente machinist who shot himself with a 
.22-caliber rifle in 1984 while a tape of Ozzy Osbourne's "Diary of a Madman" 
blasted heavy metal anthems from his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, a partially burned voodoo doll with pins in its groin and heart 
was found nailed to the back door of a Baldwin Park dressmaking shop. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1987, seven people were arrested for ransacking an El Monte warehouse, 
where they painted "Suicidal Death Tribe" in giant letters on the wall and 
jammed a dead rat through the plaster. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, a Covina teen-ager pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty 
after he and a friend were accused of mutilating several cats and using the 
blood to scrawl "666" on an elementary school wall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Youths 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, they were all just troubled youths hoping to shock the rest of the 
world into paying them attention. But Randy Emon did not think so. 
</P>
<P>
Emon, a Baldwin Park police sergeant with 18 years on the force, saw a darker 
side to those incidents, a suspicion that has launched him on a bizarre and 
spiritually turbulent journey into the world of occult-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Emon has become a leading authority among a small but growing 
number of occult specialists whose expertise in such practices as satanism, 
witchcraft and Santeria is increasingly in high demand. 
</P>
<P>
Through his course at Rio Hondo College and consulting jobs, he estimates he 
has trained more than 600 California police officers in recognizing ritualistic 
crimes. Adding church and civic groups, he figures that at least 20,000 people 
have heard him lecture about animal mutilation, necrophilia and human 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Emon, a "born-again" Christian and father of three, has also been beset by 
personal conflict as he has immersed himself in a subject that is the 
antithesis of all he believes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Events 
</P>
<P>
Emon, 36, says his children have been possessed by demons just before he 
conducted seminars on the occult. He says his wife has broken out in rashes as 
she approached the boxes of demonic memorabilia that he stores in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
And he says a pentagram, the five-pointed star often used as a symbol by 
satanists, once mysteriously appeared etched in his carpet, disappearing only 
after he dropped to his knees in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel this stuff getting to you sometimes," Emon said. "I have seen 
firsthand the power that's there. I suppose, if I didn't feel a real calling to 
learn more about this, there would be a lot less pressure in my life." 
</P>
<P>
These are statements that are sure to raise the eyebrows of skeptics. Warnings 
about supernatural forces and gruesome rituals often seem overly alarmist, if 
not flat-out fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
But with the grisly drug-cult murders in Matamoros, Mexico, earlier this year 
and the self-styled satanism allegedly practiced by Night Stalker suspect 
Richard Ramirez, such notions have slowly begun to creep into the public 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occult-Related Crimes 
</P>
<P>
Some experts now say they hear of so many cases involving blood-drained 
animals, abused children and dismembered corpses that they believe occult 
rituals will be the crime of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you measure it against the tremendous gang and narcotic problems we have, 
it's still not a major issue," said Detective Patrick Metoyer, a 23-year 
veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a widely recognized expert in 
the field. "But it's something we had better be concerned with. Occult activity 
is definitely on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, as elsewhere in the state, documentation is still 
usually piecemeal and anecdotal. No police department has an officer assigned 
exclusively to such crimes. And authorities readily concede that they are not 
always equipped to decipher the clues left behind from ritualistic acts. 
</P>
<P>
That is where Emon steps in. 
</P>
<P>
When two decapitated chickens were discovered last month next to several small 
wax figurines, coconut pieces and shreds of colored cloth near a dry riverbed 
in South El Monte, it was Emon who determined that they were the remnants of a 
ritual from the Afro-Cuban religion, Santeria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Sacrifice 
</P>
<P>
No crime was committed because the animals appeared to have been slaughtered 
humanely, with a quick and clean cut, said Dan Sturkie, district supervisor for 
county Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
"But prior to this, it would have looked to us just like someone's leftover 
dinner," Sturkie said. "Now we're recognizing things more often for what they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
The same was true for Covina police who last April arrested two youths, ages 16 
and 17, for allegedly mutilating at least seven cats, scrawling satanic symbols 
with the blood and leaving the tails in a box at the Covina Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the kids were able to convince the D.A. that it was all a joke," said 
Glenn Myers, the Covina crime prevention officer. "But it was still pretty 
scary behavior. Randy was able to look at some of the stuff and let us know 
that we had a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Emon, an athletic, neatly groomed man who belongs to Cops for Christ, traces 
his connection with the occult back to 1985, shortly after Ramirez was captured 
and his obsession with satanic imagery revealed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incident in Church 
</P>
<P>
That same week, Emon said he saw a demon possess a woman during a Sunday church 
service, watching as her face grew contorted and she repeated in a deep 
masculine voice, "No, I don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
From that moment on, he said, he felt "a nudge from up there" to learn 
everything there was to know about the occult. He soon realized it would be a 
road paved with tension. 
</P>
<P>
One night, just before he was going to conduct a seminar, his eldest son 
developed a high fever as he lay on his bed, arms extended to the ceiling, 
crying, "Get away, get away." 
</P>
<P>
Emon said he placed the boy in cool water and prayed for him until the fever 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, his younger son screamed from his bedroom that he could not 
see. Emon said he wrapped his arms around him and prayed until his son's vision 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Mere Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"I realized many of the events which had occurred . . . were not mere chance, 
but the work of Satan and his demons striving to discourage my research," he 
later wrote in a Christian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Emon's experiences, however, are not shared by all in his field. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that's pretty far out," said Investigator Sandi 
Gallant, the San Francisco Police Department's occult expert. "I've certainly 
never been haunted." 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer, the LAPD's expert, said he has been invited to attend satanic rituals 
but was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see a darn thing," he said. "I didn't hear diddly-squat. I didn't see 
any devil come down." 
</P>
<P>
A professor emeritus of religion at USC even compared Satan sleuths such as 
Emon to those who conducted the communist witch-hunts during the red-baiting 
days of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
"You interpret what you find in the light of the glasses you look through," 
said Gerald Larue, who was named "Humanist of the Year" for 1989 by the 
American Humanist Assn. "You become obsessed with the enemy. And for a 
Christian, the enemy is Satan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spiritual Encounters 
</P>
<P>
But an occult expert at the Christian Research Institute in Irvine said 
experiences such as Emon's were genuine spiritual encounters that were typical 
of devout Christians who trespass in the demonic realm. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, these things are nothing short of the bizarre," said Craig Hawkins, a 
research consultant at the institute. "But for a person who believes that there 
really is a spiritual realm, that kind of thing is not impossible at all. 
That's what happens when you enter the domain of the demonic." 
</P>
<P>
Some say Emon's deep faith even enhances his expertise. George Belanger, a 
former drummer for the occult-rock band Christian Death, said Emon was 
instrumental in helping him leave satanism behind. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Christians, when they find out you're from an occult background, they 
freak out," said Belanger, now a "born-again" Christian who lives in Glendora. 
"But Randy was very sympathetic, caring and loving. I had a lot of painful 
memories and he had a real soft ear." 
</P>
<P>
Emon, who is also director of the Christian Occult Investigators Network, a 
nonprofit research group in West Covina, says he works hard to keep his 
religious views from interfering with his police work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freedom of Worship 
</P>
<P>
He stresses First Amendment rights in all of his seminars, cautioning other 
officers that satanists -- unless their rituals break the law -- have the same 
freedom to worship as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
His supervisor, Baldwin Park Police Chief Richard A. Hoskin, said that there 
have been no conflicts, but he acknowledged that the subject can get touchy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sensitive issue," Hoskin said. "As far as being an embarrassment, it 
hasn't really come to that. But we have tried to suggest to him that he not 
become actively involved in that while he's on duty." 
</P>
<P>
On- or off-duty, however, it's hard for Emon to escape the occult. The 30 to 40 
boxes of artifacts from his investigations piled in the garage of his suburban 
home serve as constant reminders of his encounters with the demonic. 
</P>
<P>
He has photos of decapitated pigs, record albums from heavy metal bands, such 
as Venom and Slayer, literary staples such as Anton LaVey's "Satanic Bible" and 
comic books with ads for "100 Ready-to-Use Mystic Chants." 
</P>
<P>
He has a Ouija Board that he says sent mystical messages to a teen-ager to take 
his own life. He has a cardboard shrine splattered with blood. And he has a 
small squirrel tail that he says was cut from the animal in a satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy is a unique individual," said Tony Palmer, whose Walnut-based firm, 
International Law Enforcement Training &amp; Consulting, hires Emon to teach 
occult seminars to police officers. "He lives this stuff. In many different 
ways."

<HEAD>Judge Says Sex Church Not Protected by Constition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple cannot claim their sex-based Church
of the Most High Goddess is a religion protected by constitutional
freedoms and thus immune from attempts to enforce vice laws, a
federal judge ruled Thursday.
   Wilbur Tracy, 51, and his wife, Mary Ellen, 47, argued that the
church, which promises salvation through sex in exchange for
monetary sacrifices, should be protected by the U.S. Constitution.
   The couple testified the church was based on an ancient Eqyptian
religion in which intercourse with Mrs. Tracy, alias priestess
Sabrina Aset, cleansed the soul as a purification rite.
   Proof came in the form of cash or other ``tokens of sacrifice,''
Mrs. Tracy testified Wednesday.
   Mrs. Tracy said she qualified as a high priestess for the
religion in 1986 by sleeping with 1,000 men over a two-year period.
   But U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne rejected the argument,
ruling after a five-day, non-jury trial that they weren't protected
from law enforcement prosecution by constitutional religious
freedom guarantees.
   The Tracys filed the lawsuit claiming city officials pursuing
prostitution charges violated her First Amendment right to
religious freedom. Named in the lawsuit were City Attorney James
Hahn and Police Chief Daryl Gates.
   Assistant City Attorney Bryon R. Boeckman said authorities
believe Mrs. Tracy and her husband used the church as a front for
prostitution.
   ``This is not a true religion,'' Boeckman said.
   Advertised in sexually explicit magazines, the church boasted
services run by the priestess wearing a strapless red-sequined
gown, high-heeled shoes and fishnet stockings.
   The sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit. The few
wall hangings in place included posters of movie stars and a framed
nude photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The Tracys filed the lawsuit while their misdemeanor criminal
convictions for prostitution and running a brothel are on appeal.
   They claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an ancient
Egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having sex
with church priestesses.
   She said initiates needed to confess and have sex before they
could be considered for sin ``negation'' and ``purification,''
   Then ``sacrifices'' of cash or other valuables were required to
show dedication to the church before having sexual intercourse.
   ``The rituals would end if there were no sacrifices?'' asked
Byrne.
   ``Correct,'' Mrs. Tracy answered. ``There is no purpose to
having your sins negated if you do not wish to emulate God.''
   She denied that she sought specific payment amounts. During her
criminal trial, testimony included allegations she demanded minimum
payments of $150.
   ``It's up to a person to decide if it's an acceptable
sacrifice,'' she said.
   She testified Tuesday that she collected about $50,000 in
donations during a three-year period, but did not keep records
regarding followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers.
   She acknowledged that about 50 percent of the men paid only one
visit and never returned.
   ``I don't think that's very unusual for any religion,'' she said.
