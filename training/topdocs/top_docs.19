<HEAD>Pollock Painting Fetches Highest Bid at Record-Breaking Auction</HEAD>

   A string of price records for contemporary
artists, including Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol, fell in
frenzied bidding at Sotheby's that fetched nearly $26 million, the
auction house said.
   ``I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this
evening,'' Lucy Mitchell-Innes, head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department said after Monday night's sale.
   The highest price bid was the $4.84 million an anonymous
Japanese dealer paid for Pollock's ``The Search,'' believed to be
his last canvas, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said.
   It was a record for a work of contemporary art, as well as a
record for the artist, she said.
   The auction of works put up for sale by various owners as well
as from Warhol's personal collection brought in $25,954,500, a
record for an auction of contemporary art, according to Sotheby's.
Of 74 lots offered, 65 were sold.
   Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including
Pollock, Warhol, Franz Kline, Cy Twombly, David Hockney, Willem de
Kooning and Richard Diebenkorn. Six paintings sold for more than $1
million, she said.
   ``The contemporary (art) world is now extremely aware of the
rarity of these really important paintings,'' Ms. Mitchell-Innes
said. ``People are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings
won't come up again. People kow this is their last shot.''
   Pollock's ``Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow,
black and white, had a presale estimate of $3 million to $4
million. The painting is from the Palm Beach residence of art
collector Belle Linsky.
   The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at
auction was the $3.63 million Jasper John's ``Out the Window''
brought in 1986 and the same amount for de Kooning's ``Pink Lady''
last May. Both paintings were sold at Sotheby's.
   The second highest bid Monday night was the $1.87 million a U.S.
dealer paid for Kline's ``Ninth Street,'' a black and white
abstract, Sotheby's said. Its presale estimate was $700,000 to
$900,000.
   The previous record for an auction of contemporary art was $18.9
million last May, according to Sotheby's.

<HEAD>The Artists: Tate Gallery Purchases Explosive Jackson Pollocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jackson Pollock was the American artist who
abandoned brushes and dripped and splashed paint straight from the
can onto canvases laid out on the floor and walls.
   His work was controversial in his lifetime and it has been
argued about ever since he died in a car crash in 1956.
   London's Tate Gallery has no doubt of his importance, and the
state museum of British and 20th-century art has just doubled its
holdings of Pollock works to six from three. It says that's more
than any other museum outside New York.
   Jeremy Lewison, the Tate curator responsible for American art,
said no other state museum in Britain has even one Pollock.
   ``The Tate now has Europe's finest collection of American
abstract expressionism,'' he said.
   That is the term for the painting style of Pollock and his
fellow artists _ Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Franz Kline and
Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner. An alternative term was ``action
painting,'' the invention of critic Harold Rosenberg.
   ``Pollock liberated the application of paint,'' Lewison said.
   Sir Alan Bowness, the Tate's director, is a Pollock enthusiast
and dismisses with a smile claims that Pollock and the other
members of the New York School of the 1940s and '50s were not true
artists.
   ``I am quite sure that Pollock's place in the history of art is
secure,'' he said in an interview. ``The three paintings we have
acquired are classic masterpieces and not simply innovative new art.
   ``Pollock was the first great American painter and one of the
major artists, if not the major one, of the mid-20th century. He
had a sense of his importance because he was the first to make
paintings like that. His work has elements of the work of Picasso
and Miro, but he did something completely new.''
   The three Pollocks, ``Birth,'' ``Summertime'' and ``Number 14,''
were painted between 1941-51. They had been on loan to the museum
since 1982.
   The director wouldn't say how much they cost, but said it was
``rather more than we would receive from the government in any one
year.'' The Tate's 1988 grant from the government for the purchase
of pictures is $3.375 million.
   The record price for a Pollock painting was the $2.5 million
paid at Sotheby's in New York last May for ``Number 26,'' painted
in 1950.
   Bowness recalled that when he was appointed director in 1980,
the Tate had three Pollocks and one of his priorities was to obtain
more.
   ``I went to New York at the end of 1980 to talk to Lee Krasner,
a very remarkable lady and an undervalued artist in her own
right,'' he said.
   ``She wanted to see her husband's work properly shown
internationally and loaned us these three works which her husband
had retained during his lifetime.''
   Shortly before she died in 1984, Krasner agreed to sell them to
the Tate over a four-year period because the museum couldn't afford
them all at once.
   The purchase has been made from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation
Inc., which is funded with the bulk of Krasner's estate, and has
granted more than $1.5 million to some 300 ``worthy artists who are
in need.''
   Bowness praised the foundation, saying he thought it a fine
thing that money from the sale of art should be ``recycled'' to
help artists.
   The most striking of the three works is ``Summertime,'' just
under 3 feet high and nearly 18 feet long, like a frieze. Pollock
laid out the canvas on the floor in 1948 and poured and dripped
paint and enamel over it in swirls and patches.
   The painting, first seen at the Betty Parsons' Gallery in New
York in 1949, expresses a sense of exhilaration and joy.
   Pollock wrote at the time, when he was living near the Atlantic
Ocean: ``My concern is with the rhythms of nature ... the way the
ocean moves. ... I work from the inside out like nature.''
   Pollock liked to paint on a big scale. Born in 1912 in Cody,
Wyo., his canvases took on the characteristic of what he called the
``vast horizontality of the land'' in the American West.
   His nephew, Jason McCoy, is a New York art dealer whose father,
Sanford, was an artist. Another uncle, Charles, was also a painter.
McCoy attended a recent reception at the Tate to announce the
Pollock purchases.
   ``Painting was always treated seriously in my family,'' recalled
McCoy, who grew up in Deep River, Conn.
   ``It had true meaning then _ something I think impossible to
conceive of now in the late 1980s. It wasn't about the monetary end
of it, but the genuine concern with the action of painting.''
   McCoy was 8 years old when his uncle died so he doesn't remember
too much about Pollock as an artist, although he does recall his
uncle giving him his first bicycle.
   Pollock lived on Long Island at that time, and while the boy
visited his house, ``his studio was not a place one toured
lightly,'' McCoy said.
   ``But young as I was, my childhood was infused with the belief
that Jackson Pollock was an important painter.''
   He said with a rueful grin: ``My father eventually stopped
painting to make a living. He went into printed circuits for
rockets.''

   A Picasso self-portrait, a town house by Philip
Johnson and Andy Warhol's ``Shot Red Marilyn'' are among the 4,529
artworks going on the block here during a 12-day, $600 million
auction frenzy that got under way Tuesday night.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, the city's biggest auction houses,
hope to ring up $572 million in sales, and Habsburg, Feldman, a
Geneva-based auctioneer, was expecting to bring in up to $30.5
million for 57 Impressionist and modern paintings.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of interest and purchasing power
around the world,'' said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's
North America. ``There is heavy buying from Europeans and
tremendous interest from the Far East, especially Japan. Korean
buyers are now emerging. And I would not count the Americans out,
either.''
   Sotheby's and Christie's were to auction 4,472 works, starting
with contemporary art sales this week.
   Among the paintings sold Tuesday night at Sotheby's were two
major drip paintings by Jackson Pollock: ``Number 8, 1950,'' which
went for $10.5 million, and ``Number 19, 1949,'' which fetched $3.6
million.
   The price paid for ``Number 8, 1950'' broke the record for a
Pollock painting, $5.72 million last year for ``Frieze.''
   Jeffrey Deitch, who bought ``Number 8'' for an anonymous
collector, called the price ``very advantageous ... Sometimes you
just get lucky.''
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973 and
inspired by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer,
sold for $5.7 million.
   Five sculptures by Claes Oldenburg were sold: ``Ice Cream
Sandwich,'' $370,000; ``Plate of Meat,'' $360,000; ``Bacon and
Egg,'' $450,000; ``Cheesecake from Javatime,'' $47,500; and ``Green
Beans,'' $240,000.
   Andy Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which portrays a ruby-lipped
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as first lady in 1963, sold for $750,000
_ more than twice the presale estimate.
   ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964 depiction of Marilyn Monroe, will be
offered at Christie's on Wednesday. The estimate for the signed,
synthetic polymer silkscreen on canvas is $1.5 million to $2
million.
   Other Christie's offerings include ``Colored Alphabet,'' a
12-by-10{ inch oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns, estimated at
$1.5 million. The theme ``is, in fact, the alphabet. But it's in
vivid, overlapping colors: various shades of blue, yellow and red
with some black,'' said Roberta Maneker, a Christie's spokeswoman.
   A Sotheby sale next Tuesday features Gauguin's ``Mata Mua,''
circa 1892, completed during the artist's first trip to Tahiti.
Estimated at $20 million to $25 million, it is being sold by Jaime
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, and Baron Hans
Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a member of the advisory board of
Sotheby's Holdings.
   The same day, ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait done in Paris
during the artist's ``blue period,'' is expected to command $15
million to $20 million. The seller is Wendell Cherry, president and
chief executive officer of Humana Inc., the Louisville, Ky.,
hospital management corporation.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow, is expected to fetch $1.5
million to $2.5 million.
   A Sotheby's sale of 20th century decorative arts Saturday will
include the only town house designed by architect Philip Johnson.
The two-story minimalist house was commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III. Andy Warhol called it ``the original New
York loft.'' Real estate taxes on it in 1988 came to $14,414.
   A Christie's impressionist sale on May 10 and May 11 is expected
to bring in $109 million to $149 million.
   The paintings include five Monets, including ``The Trees,
Autumn,'' estimated at $6 million to $8 million; seven Picassos; 10
Renoirs, including ``The Logue,'' ($2.5 million to $3.5 million),
which depicts a model and Renoir's brother, Edmond, a journalist,
peering through opera glasses, and four by Degas.
   The private collection of late movie producer Hal B. Wallis,
including two Monets, will be auctioned next week.
   Sotheby's is shooting for total sales of $260.9 million to
$340.8 million; Christie's aims for $169.9 million to $231.3
million.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Private sketches of Jack the Dripper's troubled psyche
 -Marina Vazey considers an exhibition of Jackson Pollock's collected
'psychoanalytic' drawings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARINA VAZEY

   IS EVERY scrap by a great
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or, at the least, both significant and controversial - artist of interest to
the general public as well as the scholar? Is every drawing, every piece of
evidence of help to us all in tracking the paths of genius and talent?
Moreover, should private notes and doodles be publicly presented? The secret
drawers of the studio turned out? The confidential files posthumously
exposed? These are increasingly pertinent questions for biographers - and
art historians.
Such speculation is inevitable in the face of the array of drawings
undertaken in the cause and course of psychotherapy by Jackson Pollock
(1912-1956), the first mythical character of American art, which have been
on view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. A complete and handsome
catalogue, Jackson Pollock: 'Psychoanalytic' Drawings by Professor Claudo
Cernuschi (Duke University Press) has also been published.
By his mid-30s, Pollock was probably the best known, or notorious,
contemporary painter in America, nicknamed Jack the Dripper, for his
innovative technique of pouring - even throwing - paint on to unstretched
canvas laid out on the studio floor. A member of the first generation of
abstract expressionists, the first American Ism to achieve international
recognition, he had been the subject of a picture story in Life - an
apotheosis indeed - calmly entitled 'Is he America's Greatest Living
Painter?', had represented America at the Venice Biennale, in a group show
now seen by some commentators as a conscious bid for cultural clout in the
early days of the Cold War, and had been the subject of a classic film by
Hans Namuth.
By 1958, under the inspired guidance of Bryan Robertson, Pollock's first big
retrospective was seen in Britain at the Whitechapel, and for the past four
decades Pollocks have been eagerly sought by all major museums: his 'Blue
Poles', the most costly contemporary painting of its time when purchased by
the National Gallery of Australia, was a cause celebre down under, and
graced an Australian postage stamp.
Pollock's noisy life, the subject of several biographies, continues to
command interest, while his art gains in stature, as admired in Europe -
unusually equally so in France and Germany - as it is in America. His
reputation as an artist seems relatively secure. So the question is, do we
need to see these drawings? For the public, do they cast helpful light on
his character, working methods, and illuminate his art?
The conquering hero came to New York as a student aged 15; born in Wyoming,
he had spent his childhood in California and Arizona.  He was a profoundly
neurotic and disturbed personality, as well as prodigiously prolific and
active; and in the course of his life had several sustained periods of
psychotherapy and analysis as well as in-hospital treatment, primarily for
alcoholism.
In the course of his first period of therapy, with Dr Henderson, who had
himself been analysed by Carl Gustav Jung, his analyst suggested that the
artist bring in his drawings as a means of expressing himself - Pollock
found conversation difficult - in the therapeutic situation. Nearly 25 years
after Pollock's death, Dr Henderson retrieved the drawings from his files,
exhibited them as a group, and put them on the market. Pollock's widow, the
painter Lee Krasner, went to court to prevent their sale; in her view their
public appearance violated the confidentiality of the doctor-patient
relationship. But in 1977 Krasner lost the case, and the drawings have been
in various collections since. So large a group has not been exhibited
together for more than 20 years, although they were first published as a
group in 1970, and are well documented in the Pollock catalogue raisonne
published in 1978.
The present exhibition and publication plays down to the point of
invisibility the Jungian interpretation of the drawings, and simply states
that the drawings are not the product of neurosis but the result of
Pollock's normal artistic practice. Thus there are quotation marks in the
title for the adjective 'psychoanalytic'.
Well, yes and no: Pollock studies seem all too often to reel from one
oversimplification to another. These drawings were not done for therapy,
they were part of Pollock's normal working practice, but they were used in
therapy. Pollock's communication was visual not verbal, and he was intensely
eager and receptive to a variety of visual influences, from Amer-Indian art,
heavily reliant on abstract symbols, the Mexican muralists, notably Orozco,
and, especially, Picasso and the surrealists.
These drawings do impress because of their elaborate linear structure, their
reliance on a beguiling and fascinating mixture of the representational and
the abstract, with eyes - say - or equine forms appearing from out of a
ferocious tangle of lines, stylised animal heads, stray limbs and animal
bodies, some of which appear as relatively straightforward Picassoid
variations. Anger and terror certainly are ingredients in a rather heady
emotional mix.
However, San Francisco owns a Pollock masterpiece, Guardians of the Secret,
a group of totemic figures emerging from a web of paint. To witness what
Pollock could do at the height of his powers in a full scale painting puts
the drawings into perspective as exercises, taking - in Paul Klee's phrase -
a line for a walk. After all, Jung based his study of symbols on art over
the millennia; Jungian symbols and archetypes are configurations used over
many cultures and periods. Pollock, as Picasso, drew upon this universal
seed-bed. What is characteristic of modernism in all its guises is the
wealth of visual material available to all as never before, simply in fact
of technical reasons: the abundance of museums, media and our ability to
travel.
These drawings are in fact simply a curiosity, piquant because they show
Pollock experimenting with an increasingly elaborate visual vocabulary,
playing with an increasing elaboration of form. But they were not created to
be put on public view, or to enter the public arena; they were private
works, and relatively slight. It is the circumstance of their creation, not
their actual presence, that provokes and teases. They are perhaps working
drawings of the psyche, but few are related directly to his major paintings
as we know them. Pollock's own statement, 'The source of my painting is the
unconscious' obscures as much as it illuminates, and these 'psychoanalytic'
drawings cast but fitful light on the creative process in general, and
Pollock in particular.

<HEAD>Warhol's Red Marilyn Sells For $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Warhol's portrait, ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964
depiction of Marilyn Monroe, brought $4 million at auction
Wednesday, a record for a work by the artist.
   The previous high for a Warhol painting was $3.9 million, said
Gloria Harris, a spokeswoman for Christie's. That painting sold
last year, also of the late actress, depicted her face 20 times and
is called ``Marilyn Monroe (Twenty Times).''
   ``Red Marilyn'' had a presale estimate value of between $1.5
million and $2 million. The actual selling price was $4,070,000,
Harris said.
   Harris said the auction Wednesday at Christie's fetched $31.7
million for 60 works of art. The auction of contemporary art
continues Thursday.
   ``Colored Alphabet,'' an oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns
sold for $3.5 million, the second highest price bid on Wednesday
but not a new record for a Johns.
   Other artist records at the Christie's auction included:
   _$715,000 for an Ellsworth Kelly painting, ``Black Triangle With
White.''
   _$880,000 for a Robert Motherwell painting, ``Elegy to the
Spanish Republic No. 134.''
   All prices include a 10 percent house commission.
   ``August Day,'' an oil on canvas painting by Franz Kline sold
for $2.7 million.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow brought $2.2 million.
   ``Things on the Wall'' by Roy Lichtenstein sold for $1,012,000.
   The auction Wednesday at Christie's is the second day of a
12-day selling spree at that auction house and its rival _
Sotheby's. The two houses are expected to sell 4,400 pieces of art
for more than $500 million.
   On Tuesday, record prices were set for 27 contemporary artists
at Sotheby's. Total receipts of $78.6 million there set a record
for a contemporary art auction.
   Another Pollock drip painting, ``Number 8, 1950,'' painting sold
for $11.5 million at the Sotheby's auction.
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973, inspired
by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer, fetched
$6.2 million.
   Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which depicts a ruby-lipped Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis as First Lady in 1963, sold for $750,000 _ more
than twice its presale estimate.
   On Saturday, a Sotheby's sale of 20th Century decorative arts
will include a two-story town house commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III.
   Christie's on May 10 and 11 will feature five Monets, seven
Picassos, 10 Renoir and four works by Degas.

MOCA GIVEN ART DONATION OF $60 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gift of classic modern and contemporary art, reportedly worth in excess of 
$60 million, has been donated to the Museum of Contemporary Art from the 
collection of the late Rita and Taft Schreiber. Although consisting of just 18 
works, it is in monetary and artistic terms by far the most valuable bequest 
yet received by the 10-year-old institution, MOCA director Richard Koshalek 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber collection, comprising only about 35 works altogether, has been 
universally admired by art professionals for its solidity and connoisseurship. 
The MOCA trove encompasses works by Jackson Pollock, Piet Mondrian, and Arshile 
Gorky, among others, and is regarded as the cream of the ensemble. It adds a 
significant historical and qualitative dimension to the museum's permanent 
holdings, Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Its large estimated value derives from the recent hyper-escalation in price for 
works of art at auction, which has virtually driven museums out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
The MOCA bequest was made by Schreiber's widow, Rita, who died earlier this 
year. Taft Schreiber, a director and executive at MCA Inc. and a Republican 
political activist of long standing, died in 1976. He was Ronald Reagan's 
Hollywood agent and became a friend and member of Reagan's informal "kitchen 
cabinet" when Reagan was governor. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Schreiber became a frequent visitor to MOCA in recent years. Their 
daughter, Lenore Greenberg, president of the board of MOCA, said, in a prepared 
statement, "It was my mother's wish that these works of art remain in Los 
Angeles where she and my father lived. It is especially gratifying that their 
collection is now to be given to MOCA for the enjoyment of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber gift, which includes works by 13 artists, covers the years 
between 1930 and 1960. The most prepossessing single object is Pollock's 
"Number 1," a classic "drip" painting of 1949. Executed in delicately woven 
skeins of autumnal color, the painting is considered one of the most lyrical of 
a group of pictures that represent one of the greatest aesthetic breakthroughs 
in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock, who died in an auto crash in 1956, attended Manual Arts High School in 
Los Angeles before moving to New York. Although psychologically troubled and a 
chronic alcoholic, he managed to invent a new form of "over-all" painting and 
is credited with being the first artist to directly release the contents of the 
subconscious in abstract pictorial form. 
</P>
<P>
Other works in the MOCA gift include Mondrian's "Abstract Painting" (1939); two 
versions of Alberto Giacometti's 1960 sculpture, "Tall Figure," plus his 
"Interior Studio With Three Apples"; Gorky's "Betrothal I" (1947); Pierre 
Alchinsky's "Pres de La Bete" (1960); Alexander Calder's "Portrait" (1964); 
Jean Dubuffet's "L'Ecoulment De La Ville" (1962); Morris Louis' "Pillar of 
Delay" (1961); Joan Miro's "Personnages dan La Nuit" (1949); two sculptures by 
George Rickey; Mark Rothko's "Yellow and Orange/(Red)" (1949); three paintings 
by Nicholas de Stael, and Mark Tobey's "Lake" (1959). 
</P>
<P>
The works will be exhibited at MOCA from June 3 through Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Another Pollock from the same period as "Number 1," but regarded as a less 
well-resolved painting, sold for $11.55 million last week at a Sotheby's 
auction in New York. Auction records for other leading artists in the gift, 
according to Sotheby's, include $5 million for Mondrian, $2.5 million for Miro, 
$6.8 million for Giacometti and $572,000 for Gorky. 
</P>
<P>
Koshalek praised the collection as "one assembled with extraordinary 
sensitivity, passion and clear-sighted discipline." He added that "with these 
works, we are able to strengthen the foundation of our museum, providing 
brilliant historical context for much of the work being created today." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly elated with the gift, Koshalek said that even if a museum had the funds 
to purchase, say, a valuable Pollock these days, they are scarce to the point 
of unavailability. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber group, he said, adds a crucial missing chapter in the museum's 
permanent collection. An earlier, $11-million purchase of 60 works from the 
collection of Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo gave the museum strength in 
Abstract Expressionism and early Pop Art. The 60-work collection of television 
producer Barry Lowen, bequeathed to MOCA on his death in 1985, lent it 
representation from the '60s to the present. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreiber gift adds a foundation of strong representation in the 1940s. 
Koshalek termed the Mondrian "essential to any collection" and called Gorky's 
1947 painting, "Betrothal I," "a pivotal work in the transition from Surrealism 
to Abstract Expressionism." Typical of Gorky's best work, it shows ambiguous, 
softly colored shapes in a gentle tan atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Gorky, who died in 1948, was an Armenian immigrant whose real name was Vosdanig 
Adoian. He is regarded as the artist who gave sensual reality to the ambiguous 
amoeba shapes of European biomorphic surrealists like Miro and linked them to 
the highly physical work of the Abstract Expressionists. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting by phone from Washington, Jack Cowart, head of the department and 
curator of 20th-Century Art at the National Gallery of Art said, "Bravo for 
L.A. It's a stellar group with a breath-taking level of achievement by each 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The works are monuments in the evolution of European and American art from the 
period before the Second World War to the early 1960s, and MOCA and the L.A. 
Basin are very, very lucky to receive them." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the National Gallery would have liked to receive the gift, Cowart 
said: "I think it is very right that this major portion of the collection 
should remain right there where it is (in L.A.). So whether the National 
Gallery or Chicago or Dallas or Atlanta would want it is a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
"The works were amassed by great, passionate and acute collectors who lived 
with their art and exercised a fabulous process of choice and connoisseurship." 
</P>
<P>
Koshalek pointed out MOCA's longstanding intention to collect "in depth," 
acquiring several examples of an artist's work rather than just one. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Giacomettis give us depth right off the bat. If you add the Schreiber 
Rothko to what we already have in the Panza group, we now probably have the 
best collection in the country." 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum's involvement with the Schreiber collection goes back to 
1983 when portions of it were included in the inaugural "The First Show," which 
presented works from eight private collections. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the MOCA gift, County Museum of Art director Earl A. Powell said, 
"We are pleased that these great works from the Schreiber collection will 
remain in Los Angeles. It is a very distinguished assemblage, particularly the 
Jackson Pollock." 
</P>
<P>
The museum was founded in 1979 and opened in a converted warehouse in Little 
Tokyo in 1983. Permanent MOCA headquarters, designed by architect Arata 
Isozaki, opened at 250 S. Grand Ave. in December, 1986.

   Works by 27 contemporary artists fetched record
prices as the annual spring art-buying frenzy got under way at
Sotheby's auction house.
   Reflecting a trend in the art world, about a fourth of the
buyers Tuesday were Japanese, said Lucy Mitchell Innes, a Sotheby's
spokeswoman.
   Among the records was $11.5 million for a Jackson Pollock drip
painting that the buyer felt was a bargain.
   ``I was extremely pleased to get it at what many in the trade
feel is a very advantageous price,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, who
bought ``Number 8, 1950,'' for an anonymous collector. ``Sometimes
you just get lucky.''
   The previous record for a Pollock painting was $5.72 million
last year for his ``Frieze.''
   Tuesday's sale, with total receipts of $78.6 million, was a
record for a contemporary art auction.
   Tuesday's auction kicked off 12 days of selling at Sotheby's and
Christie's, two of the world's biggest auction houses. More than
4,400 artworks are expected to be sold for a total of $572 million.
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973, inspired
by the suicide of a close friend of the artist, sold for $6.2
million. The record for Bacon was $1.76 million in 1987 for ``Study
for Portrait II.''
   Five sculptures with tasty themes by Claes Oldenburg also sold:
``Ice Cream Sandwich,'' $407,000; ``Plate of Meat,'' $396,000;
``Bacon and Egg,'' $495,000; ``Cheesecake from Javatime,'' $52,250;
and ``Green Beans,'' $264,000.
   Andy Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which portrays a ruby-lipped
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as first lady in 1963, sold for
$750,000, more than twice the presale estimate.
   All prices include a 10 percent house commission.
   Next Tuesday, Sotheby's sale of impressionist and modern
paintings and sculpture will feature Gauguin's ``Mata Mua,'' circa
1892, completed during the artist's first trip to Tahiti. Estimated
at $20 million to $25 million, it is being sold by Jaime
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, and Baron Hans
Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a member of the advisory board of
Sotheby's Holdings.
   The same day, ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait done in Paris
during the artist's blue period, is expected to command $15 million
to $20 million. It is being sold by Wendell Cherry, president and
chief executive officer of Humana Inc., the hospital management
corporation based in Louisville, Ky.
   Another Warhol portrait, ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964 depiction of
Marilyn Monroe, will be offered Wednesday at Christie's. The
estimate for the silkscreen work is $1.5 million to $2 million.

Two Jackson Pollock drip paintings expected to fetch millions were among the 
offerings Tuesday in the first night of a 12-day, $600-million auction of art 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock's "Number 8, 1950," estimated at $8 million to $10 million, and "Number 
19, 1949," estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million, were expected to ring up 
the largest prices at the opening of the sale by Sotheby's and Christie's, the 
city's biggest auction houses, and Habsburg, Feldman, a Geneva-based 
auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of interest and purchasing power around the 
world," said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America. "There is 
heavy buying from Europeans and tremendous interest from the Far East, 
especially Japan. Korean buyers are now emerging. And I would not count the 
Americans out, either." 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's and Christie's were to auction 4,472 works, starting with 
contemporary art sales this week, and hope to bring in $572 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Among the works to be auctioned Tuesday was "Triptych May-June," completed by 
Francis Bacon in 1973 and inspired by the suicide of the artist's close friend, 
George Dyer. It was expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the auction block was Andy Warhol's "Red Jackie," portraying a 
ruby-lipped Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as First Lady in 1963. Its estimate 
before Tuesday's sale was $300,000 to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Marilyn," a 1964 depiction of Marilyn Monroe, will be offered at 
Christie's tonight. The estimate for the signed, synthetic polymer silk-screen 
on canvas is $1.5 million to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Sotheby's sale next Tuesday features Gaugin's "Mata Mua," completed in 1892 
during the artist's first trip to Tahiti. Estimated at $20 million to $25 
million, it is being sold by Jaime Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin 
fortune, and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza.

   Christie's set record prices for 14 artists at a strong sale of contemporary art last night. 

   The New York auction house sold 60 of 64 works offered for a total of $19.5 million, a record for a contemporary art auction at Christie's. 

   The highest-priced painting at the session was a large 1962 work by Jasper Johns called "Diver," which sold for $4.2 million, a record for a work by a living artist. 
Christie's wouldn't identify the buyer. 

   Auctioneer Christopher Burge said: "It was the easiest sale in the world. 
In many cases, there were tons of hands." 

   The overflow crowd included dealers from around the world, actor Steve Martin and a large number of Japanese collectors. 

   The second-highest price was $3.5 million for a Jackson Pollock drip painting. 
It was bought by Japanese dealer Kazuo Fujii; he had purchased a Pollock for $4.8 million Monday evening at Sotheby's. 

   Prices continued strong for works by the late Andy Warhol. 
After heavy bidding, a Marilyn Monroe silkscreen went for $484,000. 
It was expected that it would bring an estimated $60,000 to $80,000. 
A Warhol silkscreen of Elvis Presley sold for $880,000, far above an estimate of $250,000 to $350,000. 

   Christie's is a unit of London-based Christie's International PLC.

CASHING IN ON A SELLER'S ART MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is cashing in on art at New York's upcoming round of big-ticket auctions 
and why are these collectors unloading their treasures? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the sellers aren't telling. 
</P>
<P>
While the auction houses thrive on highly publicized "single owner" sales 
featuring celebrated collections, the majority of items listed in auction 
catalogs are sold anonymously. In the catalogue for Christie's May 3 sale of 
contemporary art, for example, owners of only 11 of the 64 items offered are 
identified. In a comparable sale of 85 lots, on May 2 at Sotheby's, owners of 
only 18 works are named. 
</P>
<P>
Secrecy is essential in a business that prides itself on protecting the privacy 
of clients who don't want publicity about their financial affairs. But a survey 
of May auctions suggests several categories of sellers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Private collectors who plunge into a bull market when their taste has 
changed or their passion for the chase has cooled. Los Angeles collector Max 
Palevsky, for one, is selling "Shot Red Marilyn," a striking painting of 
Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol. The 1964 silk-screened canvas, valued at $1.5 
million to $2 million, is for sale on May 3 at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best Pop image," Palevsky said. "It's a vacuum. It's empty. It's 
completely blank, and that's what Warhol's art is about." 
</P>
<P>
Why sell such a quintessential Warhol? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good time" in the market, Palevsky said, referring to the artist's 
death in 1987 and his current retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. 
Furthermore, the portrait "is not a picture that I'm attached to." A set of 
eight variously colored "Marilyn" lithographs in his collection suit him better 
than the painting because "the repetition and changes in tonalities in the 
lithographs moderate the vacuity that's so hard to live with," said the 
collector whose acquisitive interests have shifted to Japanese prints and 
Arts-and-Crafts-period objects. 
</P>
<P>
A 1949 triptych by Jackson Pollock from the Los Angeles collection of Betty W. 
and Stanley K. Sheinbaum will go on the block in the same sale. Christie's 
expects the three panels to bring between $1.5 million and $2 million. The 
couple, who no longer collect contemporary art, decided to sell their Pollock 
as part of an attempt to "simplify" their lives and to make room for other 
artworks, Betty W. Sheinbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avid collectors who have been priced out of a rapidly escalating area of 
the market, some of whom sell their collections to finance their habit in less 
expensive territory. One example is Sotheby's May 9 auction of eight 
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, valued at $55.7 million to $66.8 
million, from the collection of Jaime Ortiz-Patino, a grandson of Simon I. 
Patino, who made a fortune in the tin mines of Bolivia. Ortiz-Patino said in a 
press release that he got into the Impressionist market too late and will use 
proceeds of the sale to acquire paintings from less expensive periods as well 
as silver, rare books and manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
Another is a $20-million sale of 17 landscape paintings, May 10 at Christie's, 
from a collection formed by the founders of G.D. Searle &amp; Co. 
pharmaceuticals. The decision to sell "reflects the fact that the market in 
those areas of the greatest interest to us, Impressionist and 
Post-Impressionist paintings, has outpaced our collecting resources," said 
Daniel Crow Searle in a prepared statement issued by the auction house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Museums that are pressured to marshal their resources as they attempt to 
build distinctive collections. The Newport Harbor Art Museum, which 
concentrates on post-war California art, is selling an 11-foot-by-9-foot 
painting of a palm tree by East Coast artist Jim Dine, valued at $70,000 to 
$100,000. The museum is selling the work because it already has a better 
example of Dine's work than the atypical "Palm Tree" (which was commissioned 
for the Newporter Resort and given to the museum when the hotel changed hands), 
said museum director Kevin Consey. Proceeds from the sale can be used to buy 
one or more works that are better suited to the collection, Consey said. 
</P>
<P>
Several other museums are auctioning works to benefit their acquisitions funds, 
which can't easily cope with today's prices. Sotheby's May 9 and 10 sale of 
Impressionist and modern art, for example, offers a Dresden landscape by Oskar 
Kokoschka and a Paris street scene by Kees van Dongen from the Art Institute of 
Chicago, two Renoirs from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and five works from 
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, including a small portrait by Henri Matisse and 
a Chaim Soutine still life. 
</P>
<P>
In the same auction, the Walker Art Center in Milwaukee is selling a bronze 
portrait of Rembrandt by late 19th- and early 20th-Century French artist 
Emile-Antoine Bourdelle to establish a purchase fund for contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charitable foundations with significant art assets that suddenly seem too 
valuable to keep. Two current examples have disappointed museums by removing 
long-term loans and hoped-for gifts from their walls. The Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art lost the late film producer Hal B. Wallis' collection of 
Impressionist art, put on loan there two years ago but now slated for sale May 
10 at Christie's. The collection of nine paintings, valued at more than $20 
million, is being sold to support medical research and conservation of natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of Duke Cosimo I de'Medici" by Jacopo da Carucci, a Florentine 
Mannerist known as Pontormo, which had hung for 19 years at the Frick 
Collection in Manhattan, will go on the block on May 31 at Christie's. Proceeds 
from the sale, expected to exceed $20 million, will go to the Homeland 
Foundation. The late Chancey Devereaux Stillman, the painting's owner, 
established the foundation to benefit Wethersfield House (his estate, now open 
to the public) and Catholic welfare and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heirs of collectors, some of whom have left instructions for their 
collections to be sold. Two groups of contemporary art offered on May 2 at 
Sotheby's fit this category: the Los Angeles-based collection of land developer 
Edwin Janss Jr. ($8.9 million to $11.5 million) and 19 pieces of Pop art from 
the collection of German industrialist Karl Stroher ($3 million to $3.9 
million). In the same sale, Pollock's "Number 19," a 1949 drip painting billed 
as "the most important Pollock to come to auction," will be sold from the 
estate of Baltimore collector Israel Rosen. Sotheby's has valued the work at $3 
million to $4.5 million, just under the artist's record of $4.8 million, set 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
May and November mark the high tides of New York art auctions. This year, 
during the first two weeks of May, Christie's and Sotheby's will offer an 
estimated $85.9 million to $113.1 million worth of contemporary art and $317.2 
million to $422.5 million of Impressionist and modern art. The Pontormo 
portrait will go on the block May 31 in a sale of Old Master paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of Sotheby's contemporary auction are the May 2 sales of the Janss 
and Stroher collections. The spotlight of Sotheby's May 9 Impressionist and 
modern sale is on the Ortiz-Patino collection. 
</P>
<P>
The May 10 sale of the Wallis and Searle collections are the big events for 
Christie's in the first half of the month, but talk about that auction is 
likely to fade by May 31, when the Pontormo goes under the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, auction watchers continue to wonder how much higher prices can rise 
and if there is any top of a market that has already left museums on the 
sidelines. Answers are not to be found by consulting the stock market or even 
the general economic climate because "art objects are unique and the art market 
is driven by the objects," said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
One must know what's coming up for sale in future auctions to predict the 
health of the art market, Marion said. "What's in the pipeline now is pretty 
incredible. I don't look for any slackening at all."

<TEXT>
   An 88-year-old Spanish immigrant who waited more
than four decades to have his novel published is among nominees for
fiction in the 1990 National Book Awards.
   Felipe Alfau was one of five novelists nominated in the fiction
category. Others included two first-time novelists, Elena Castedo
and Jessica Hagedorn, and writers Charles Johnson and Joyce Carol
Oates.
   The nominations were announced Thursday by the National Book
Foundation, the non-profit organization that sponsors the annual
awards.
   In the non-fiction category, authors were nominated for works
about the Morgan banking family, former President Nixon, American
artist Jackson Pollock and Harold Ickes, a member of Franklin
Roosevelt's cabinet.
   Alfau wrote ``Chromos,'' published by Dalkey Archive Press, in
the 1940s. The book is about the experiences of a group of
Spaniards who move to Manhattan in the 1930s.
   A translator for a New York bank before retiring, Alfau also
wrote the 1936 novel ``Locos: A Comedy of Gestures'' and is the
author of a children's book.
   Castedo, who grew up in Chile and worked at odd jobs while
traveling around the world, was nominated for ``Paradise,''
published by Grove Weidenfeld. The book is about a Latin American
ghetto family.
   Hagedorn, a poet, playwright and commentator for public radio,
wrote ``Dogeaters,'' published by Pantheon Books. Her first novel
explores native tradition and popular American culture colliding in
the Philippines, Hagedorn's homeland.
   Johnson, a professor of English at the University of Washington,
was nominated for ``Middle Passage,'' published by Atheneum
Publishers, about a newly freed slave's voyage on a slave ship
bound for Africa in 1830.
   Oates, who won the National Book Award for fiction in 1970 for
her novel ``them,'' is nominated for ``Because It Is Bitter, and
Because It Is My Heart,'' published by E.P. Dutton-William Abrahams
Books. Her 20th novel is about a young white woman and a black
classmate brought together by a murderous street fight.
   Finalists in the non-fiction category include:
   -Ron Chernow for ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking
Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance,'' publisher Morgan Entrekin
Books-Atlantic Monthly Press.
   -Samuel G. Freedman for ``Small Victories: The Real World of a
Teacher, Her Students and Their High School,'' publisher
HarperCollins.
   -Roger Morris for ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an
American Politician,'' publisher Henry Holt.
   -Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith for ``Jackson Pollock: An
American Saga,'' publisher Clarkson N. Potter.
   -T.H. Watkins for ``Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of
Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952,'' publisher Henry Holt.
   The two winners will be announced Nov. 27. Each winner receives
a $10,000 check.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Modern art valued at more than $60 million,
including a classic ``drip'' painting by Jackson Pollock, has been
donated to the Museum of Contemporary Art.
   The gift of 18 works by 13 artists is from the estate of Rita
and Taft Schreiber and also includes art by Piet Mondrian, Arshile
Gorky and Joan Miro.
   Schreiber, who died in 1976, was Ronald Reagan's Hollywood press
agent and a member of his ``kitchen cabinet'' when he was governor
of California. Mrs. Schreiber, who died earlier this year, was a
frequent visitor to the museum.
   ``It was my mother's wish that these works of art remain in Los
Angeles where she and my father lived,'' said the couple's
daughter, Lenore Greenberg, MOCA board president.
   The 18 pieces are considered the best of the widely admired
Schreiber collection, said Richard Koshalek, director of the
10-year-old museum.
   ``With these works, we are able to strengthen the foundation of
our museum, providing brilliant historical context for much of the
work being created today,'' he said.
   He said the collection was assembled with ``extraordinary
sensitivity, passion and clear-sighted discipline.''
   The works span from 1930 to the mid-1960s. Predominant among
them is Pollock's ``Number 1,'' a classic ``drip'' painting from
1949.
   Other works include Mondrian's 1939 ``Abstract Painting,'' Mark
Rothko's 1949 ``Yellow and Orange-(Red),'' two versions of Alberto
Giacometti's 1960 sculpture ``Tall Figure'' and his ``Interior
Studio with Three Apples.''
   Also included are Miro's 1949 ``Personnages dan La Nuit,''
Gorky's 1947 ``Betrothal I,'' Pierre Alchinsky's 1960 ``Pres de La
Bete,'' Alexander Calder's 1964 ``Portrait,'' Morris Louis' 1961
``Pillar of Delay'' and Jean Dubuffet's 1962 ``L'Ecoulment De La
Ville.''

<TEXT>
   The art market continued to be hot last night as Sotheby's sold $26 million of contemporary art, a record for a single session. 

   Part of the sale included a continuation of the Andy Warhol auction during which paintings owned by Mr. Warhol sold for $5.1 million. 
This brings the total sales for the late Mr. Warhol's belongings to $22.6 million, with only one more session to go today. 

   Mr. Warhol's art itself was a standout with a painting called "210 Coca-Cola Bottles" selling for $1.4 million, a record for the artist. 

   Numerous other records were set by the overflow crowd, which included Sylvester Stallone, Lee Radziwill, Bianca Jagger, many art dealers and a strong showing of Japanese collectors. 

   During the evening, a record price was also set for a Jackson Pollock, which sold for $4.8 million. 
This wasn't just a record for the artist, but was also the highest price ever paid for a contemporary painting at auction. 
The painting was bought by a Japanese dealer. 

   Other records included works by Franz Kline, Richard Diebenkorn, Cy Twombly and Joan Mitchell. 

   In a separate part of the sale, not reflected in the above totals, Sotheby's, a unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc., sold 15 works of art for $1.9 million to benefit a local AIDS program. 

   In the part of the sale that didn't include Mr. Warhol's collection, 43 works of art sold, nine didn't sell. 

   Richard Gray, a Chicago dealer said, "We've been blaming it all on the Warhol hoopla, but lots of things were very strong. 
The continued strength in the market surprises me."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: REPORTED SIGHTINGS: ART CHRONICLES, 1957-1987 BY JOHN 
ASHBERY EDITED BY DAVID BERGMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $35; 417 PP.)

Poet John Ashbery, whose "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" won the Pulitzer 
Prize for Poetry in 1975, is perhaps less well known for his art criticism. The 
best of these essays, written over the course of 30 years and ranging over such 
topics as Dada and Surrealism, the expatriate American art community in Paris, 
the careers of Jackson Pollock, Giorgio de Chirico, Henri Michaux, architecture 
and wallpaper, are collected in this volume. 
</P>
<P>
Ashbery writes as a keen, informed, but disinterested observer. Analyses of 
painterly qualities and habits recombine with personal responses or musings. "A 
painter like (Jackson) Pollock . . . was gambling everything on the fact that 
he was the greatest painter in America, for if he wasn't, he was nothing, and 
the drips would turn out to be random splashes from the brush of a careless 
housepainter." 
</P>
<P>
In his essay about expatriate American artists in Paris ("American Sanctuary in 
Paris") Ashbery writes of "the advantages of isolation" to the creative 
process, and the importance of breaking from tradition to claim an individual 
style. "It is as though (these artists) had given up all efforts at trying to 
please a public, whether French or American, and had gone back to pleasing 
themselves." But it is in his essay on the painter Esteban Vicente that Ashbery 
is at his most original and enlightening. The artist, Ashbery reports, has 
tried "to get rid of brushstrokes, which had begun to seem to him as something 
false . . . (and often) made to substitute for genuine passion and 
inventiveness in painterly abstract painting." Ashbery elucidates this 
sentiment with a recollection of a Mutt and Jeff strip, "in which Jeff went 
into business selling honey with a dead bee in each jar as proof of genuineness 
. . . frantic brushwork is often the dead bee in Abstract Expressionist 
painting." Elena Brunet

WARHOL'S 'MARILYN MONROE' FETCHES RECORD $4 MILLION

Like a wave in the high seas of a rising art market, an international crowd of 
contemporary art aficionados left Sotheby's in its wake and rolled on to 
Christie's Wednesday night to witness the opening of the second half of a 
series of big-ticket auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 1,200 was rewarded with a few moments of high drama when 
"Shot Red Marilyn," a vibrantly colored painting of Marilyn Monroe by Andy 
Warhol, brought $4 million from Kazuo Fujii, a Tokyo dealer. The quintessential 
Pop painting, from the collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Max Palevsky, 
was valued at $1.5 million to $2.5 million, but bidding soon soared past that 
figure. A few seconds later, the final bid passed the artist's record of $3.96 
million set last November. Applause burst out as Christopher Burge, Christie's 
president and auctioneer, brought down the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised. There was tremendous interest in the Warhol, but I just 
wanted it to set a record and it did," said Martha Baer, head of the auction 
house's contemporary art department. 
</P>
<P>
The 1964 painting bears an oft-repeated image in Warhol's work, but it has the 
distinction of being one of four "Shot" canvases, named for a shooting incident 
in the late artist's studio. "Shot Red Marilyn" was actually shot -- right 
between the eyes -- and repaired later. The canvas was in the collection of 
artist Robert Rauschenberg before Palevsky bought it at the Leo Castelli 
Gallery in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Another high point in the evening occured when Jasper Johns' tiny 
(12-inch-by-10 1/2-inch) canvas, called "Colored Alphabet," brought $3.5 
million from an unidentified European dealer. Burge almost knocked down the 
painting at around $2 million, but suddenly a cry rang out from the back of the 
crowded sale room indicating that another bidder had entered the competition. 
When the sale was complete, a man in the audience whipped out his pocket 
calculator and announced that the painting cost more than $25,000 per square 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such excitement, Wednesday night's numbers were not as big as 
Tuesday's. Christie's sold 60 artworks for a total of $31.76 million. That 
figure was well above the most optimistic estimate of $28.8 million but far 
less than Sotheby's record-setting $78.6-million sale of 103 items the previous 
evening. But most pieces offered at Christie's met or exceeded their estimates 
-- 15 of them setting records -- and only six lots failed to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two sales indicate the continuing strength of the contemporary 
art market, a riskier territory than older periods of art that have been 
securely established in history. While auction watchers often gasp at sharply 
escalating contemporary art prices, auction house experts insist that the 
market is behaving in a controlled manner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not berserk. It's just very, very strong," Berge said. 
</P>
<P>
One area of strength was seen Wednesday night in works by Abstract 
Expressionist Franz Kline, which twice broke his record of $2.3 million. No 
sooner did Kline's "August Day" sell for $2.75 million than "Scudera," said to 
be his last complete painting, brought $2.86 million from New York dealer Allan 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
A Jackson Pollock triptych from the Los Angeles collection of Stanley K. and 
Betty W. Sheinbaum, valued at $1.5 million to $2.5 million, sold for $2.2 
million to an anonymous American dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Lichtenstein's playful 1972 painting, "Things on the Wall," fetched its 
predicted price of $1 million from an unidentified American collector. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 records, three were claimed by well established women and all 
three sales roughly doubled estimates. Helen Frankenthaler's 1973 stained 
canvas, "Cravat," valued at $80,000 to $120,000, brought $220,000. Agnes 
Martin's pale striped painting, "Untitled 5," fetched $264,000 instead of the 
predicted price of $100,000 to $150,000. "King of Spades" by Joan Mitchell, an 
energetic abstraction valued at $180,000 to $250,000, commanded a price of 
$462,000. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the second part of Sotheby's contemporary art auction 
brought $19 million for 323 artworks, bringing the total for Sotheby's entire 
sale to $98.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's contemporary art sale continues today when 350 paintings, sculptures 
and drawings, valued at $6 million to $8 million, go under the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
Next week a new wave of art collector and dealers will roll into Manhattan for 
sales of Impressionist and modern art expected to total as much as $422 
million. Sotheby's will begin the new round of sales on Tuesday night and the 
following day. Christie's will take over on Wednesday evening and Thursday.

   Sotheby's sold a record $18.9 million of contemporary art at an auction last night. 

   The amount was a record for a single session of contemporary art, far exceeding the previous record of $13.2 million. 
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's, said it was a "truly remarkable sale," setting records for 17 artists. 

   The top-grossing lot of the evening was a painting called "Pink Lady" by Willem de Kooning that sold for $3.6 million, including a 10% buyer's commission. 
The painting ties the record for the highest auction price ever for a work of contemporary art, paid for a Jasper Johns painting last fall. 

   The evening's emotional high point came when a Japanese businessman successfully bid for another De Kooning, "Woman", at $2.5 million. 

   The businessman, Morimasa Ohkawa, chief executive officer of a Tokyo real-estate development firm, let out a scream when the auctioneer indicated his bid had won. 
The painting is an abstract, brightly-colored oil depicting a female. 

   The auctioneer, John L. Marion, said: "We've got a satisfied buyer. 
That's what I like." 
Mr Ohkawa said, through an interpreter, that it was his first auction ever and his first acquisition of a contemporary work. 
The interpreter said: "He feels very lucky because the price was much lower than he was prepared to go. 
He was willing to go to $3.5 million." 

   Mr. Ohkawa, wearing a tuxedo, said his private collection includes impressionist art and a great number of traditional Japanese works. 

   The painting was sold by Playboy Enterprises Inc.; it had been expected to bring $1.5 million to $2 million. 
In addition, Playboy sold another of the evening's top-grossing lots, a Jackson Pollock drip painting that went for $2,750,000. 

   Sotheby's is the auction-house unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. of London.

   Historical novel ``Middle Passage,'' which
chronicles the journey of a freed African slave returning to his
homeland, won the 1990 National Book Award competition for fiction
Tuesday night.
   Charles Johnson wrote the book, which takes place in 1830 and
tells the story of a terrifying voyage to Africa on a clipper ship.
   Ron Charnow's ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty
and the Rise of Modern Finance'' won in the non-fiction category
during the 40th anniversary awards dinner at the Plaza Hotel.
   The competition was marked by the presence of little-known
writers from small publishing houses and ``acute dividedness''
among the jurors who chose them.
   The five fiction works that were up for consideration included
three books by immigrant authors - the first novels of Jessica
Hagedorn and Ilena Castedo, and the 42-year-old second book of
Felipe Alfau, who is 88.
   Johnson, an English professor at the University of Washington
who wrote two other novels and a collection of short fiction, was
among two established writers in the fiction category. The other
was Joyce Carol Oates.
   Johnson's novel, published by Atheneum, uses the freed slave's
difficult trip as a catalyst for self-discovery and also marks a
passage for African-American fiction. The title refers to the
crossing of the Atlantic to America from Africa by slave ships.
   ``In this decade, we will see the emergence of black-author
fiction that will help us as a people and as a culture to move from
narrow complaint to broad celebration,'' said Johnson, 42.
   One of the fiction jurors, writer Paul West, said there was
``acute dividedness over nearly everything'' discussed by the
five-member panel that chose the nominees. He charged that ``ethnic
considerations, ideology and moral self-righteousness'' had
prevailed over style and merit.
   But Sonny Mehta, president of Alfred A. Knopf publishers, said
although the list of nominees was obscure, he saw nothing
``sinister'' in the choices.
   ``It looks as if they were looking around for books that have
not had their share of praise,'' Mehta said.
   In the non-fiction category, the four other finalists were books
about teaching, former President Nixon, artist Jackson Pollock and
Roosevelt Cabinet member Harold Ickes.
   Chernow's winner was published by Atlantic Monthly
Press-Entrekin Books. The book traces the ups and downs of the most
influential family in the history of American banking. It charts
the Morgan family's story and the changing relationships between
financiers and companies since 1838.
   ``My motivation for writing the book started with my concern
with what was happening in the 1980s,'' said Chernow, 41, of
Brooklyn Heights.
   He said 19th century bankers had ``a very different notion of
what business was, it was a gentlemen's club against today's wild
carnival of greed.''
   The National Books Foundation also honored Saul Bellow, Nobel
laureate and the only three-time winner of the National Book Award.
   The 10 finalists came from among 375 books put forward by 72
publishers. For the first time in years, none came from such
prestigious houses as Knopf; Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; or Simon &amp;
Schuster.
   Alfau's book, ``Chromos,'' was retrieved from oblivion by Dalkey
Archive Press, an Illinois publisher whose list amounts to about 15
titles a year and whose biggest seller has been a novel that sold
6,000 copies.
   The Spanish-born Alfau had his first novel, ``Locos: A Comedy of
Gestures,'' published in 1936. It was rediscovered and reissued
last year by Dalkey. When the publisher asked whether Alfau had
written anything else, he came up with ``Chromos,'' which he
finished in 1948.
   Castedo's ``Paradise'' was published by Grove Weidenfeld and
Hagedorn's ``Dogeaters'' by Pantheon, which has been warring with
its parent company, Random House, over Pantheon's tradition of
against-the-grain publishing.
   Atheneum brought out Johnson's ``Middle Passage'' and the Oates
book, ``Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart,'' came
from E.P. Dutton-William Abrahams.
   The other non-fiction finalists were:
   ``Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and
Their High School,'' by Samuel G. Freedman.
   ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician,''
by Roger Morris.
   ``Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and
Gregory White Smith.
   ``Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes,
1874-1952,'' by T.H. Watkins.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Fresh splash of green: Signs of recovery in the art market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A painting by Matisse was sold at auction in New York last month for a
record Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m) and a Monet for Dollars 12.1m. This week
in Paris a Van Gogh fetched FFr55m (Pounds 6.5m). And in London on Wednesday
a Goya was bought by the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, for Pounds
4.95m. The international art market is suddenly sprouting green shoots after
more than two years of decline and despair.
Undoubtedly a revival of interest in acquiring art, generated in the US, is
restoring confidence to the auction houses of Paris and London, and to
hard-pressed antique dealers. But the revival is selective and fickle. At
best it might persuade owners of important works of art that they can now
consign them to auction with a good chance of making a sale; at worst it
marks the end of the recession, but with any general revival still in the
future.
The fall in the art market was sudden and sharp. The cracks were already
appearing at the New York auctions in May 1990 when a Japanese paper
manufacturer, Ryoei Saito, bought a Van Gogh portrait for Dollars 82.5m and
a Renoir music hall scene for Dollars 78.1m, by far the highest prices ever
paid for works of art. Alongside the records there were a disturbingly high
percentage of unsold lots. By the next round of important art sales in
London in December 1990 the fall in demand was apparent. Christie's auction
totalled Pounds 10.3m, compared with Pounds 76.5m a year earlier, while
Sotheby's only managed Pounds 6.6m as against Pounds 76m in December 1989.
The auction houses were hit hard. Sotheby's fell into loss, and Christie's
saw its profits fall sharply. But they had partly been responsible for
creating the heights from which the market fell. They offered guarantees to
important sellers and loans to prospective buyers, encouraging speculative
purchases, especially among the Japanese. The fastest growing market had
been for post-1870 art which quickly came to represent almost 50 per cent of
auction houses' turnover in the late 1980s.
The recent sprinkling of high prices reflects a very different market. Most
dealers have too much debt, and too many unsold works of art, to be big
buyers, and the Japanese are almost totally absent - except as sellers. But
new collectors are appearing, many of them Americans who think that the US
is moving out of recession and that art looks a better home for surplus
money compared with the low interest rates offered by the banks. The Matisse
went to a first-time buyer, as did the Monet.
To date the revival in the art market is concentrated on undoubted
masterpieces, which have an international appeal, and works of interest
specifically to American buyers. Sotheby's auction of American paintings
earlier this month was its best in this field for 2 1/2 years, totalling
Dollars 11m. Latin American art is even more buoyant, reflecting the
resilience of the regional economies such as Mexico and Venezuela. At
Sotheby's, a brothel scene by Colombian artist Fernando Botero went for
Dollars 1.54m in an auction which brought in more than Dollars 10m and was
90 per cent sold.
There are also encouraging bids coming from east Asia. The Japanese are
still licking their wounds but the Koreans, Taiwanese and some Hong Kong
Chinese are competing fiercely for Asian works of art. Contemporary Chinese
paintings represent a new market which is helping auction houses make good
some of their losses on the impressionists. Last month, a painting by Zhang
Daqian sold for more than Pounds 600,000.
Even the tricky area of contemporary art is looking up. This is one area
where American artists, in particular the abstract expressionists of the
post-1945 New York school such as Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns, are
pre-eminent. This is the art sought by rich Americans, especially the new
rich. Charles Saatchi this month reckoned the market was strong enough to
absorb 14 works from his collection in New York. He was over-optimistic and
five were unsold but the most expensive, Andy Warhol's Marilyn X 100, found
a buyer at Dollars 3.74m. This was less than its estimate, and much less
than the Dollars 7m that Saatchi had been asking for it privately, but he
will have shown a profit on the picture. A work by Johns made Dollars 2.3m
and one by Pollock Dollars 1.98m. Both sold below estimate but at least the
owners, who probably paid comparatively little for the paintings in the
1970s, were prepared to risk exposing them at auction.
Prices for top quality impressionist and contemporary art have fallen by
about 40 per cent and are back to the levels of around 1988. But good
pictures now attract interest. In London an important Kandinsky abstract
made a solid Pounds 5.5m, the first time a modern work has broken the Pounds
5m barrier since the market collapsed. And although the first major work by
Francis Bacon to appear since his death was well below the Pounds 1m target,
its price of Pounds 735,000 would be regarded by many as fair. If sellers
are prepared to accept lower estimates on their works, there is now a
market.
But many owners are still chasing the prices of the late 1980s. This is
particularly true of British art, which is bought mainly by British
collectors and which mirrors the depressed state of the economy. A Turner
Venetian watercolour, which had set a record for an English watercolour of
Pounds 440,000 in 1988, was unsold last month, with bids failing to reach
Pounds 400,000.
Despite such setbacks, signs of an upturn in the art market are now reaching
the dealers and auction houses. In recent months, closures have become rarer
and trade is picking up.
The 17 dealers in London's Cork Street stayed open for a weekend last month
and enjoyed a high level of interest. One, Leslie Waddington, sold Pounds
250,000 worth of art; another, the Redfern, 20 works. The Bill Jackson
Gallery was visited by 2,000 people. Eskenazi, an oriental dealer, opened an
exhibition of rare Chinese lacquer on Monday and has already sold three
pieces to museums, with three more reserved.
Like the economy at large the art market's recovery is likely to be hesitant
and fitful. But as Christmas approaches, the mood is considerably more
cheerful than it has been for the past two years.

NEARLY FLAWLESS CACHE FOR MOCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When anything goes right in this world our tendency is to look for the catch. 
Last month the Museum of Contemporary Art was bequeathed a gift of 18 works 
from the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection, including prime examples by such 
masters as Jackson Pollock, Alberto Giacometti and Arshile Gorky. The news made 
the front page because the works are rare and rumored to be worth in excess of 
$60 million. It looked like a real windfall for art-hungry MOCA. 
</P>
<P>
The cache has just gone quietly on inaugural view until Oct. 18. The public -- 
surely incited to suspicion by such generosity -- now has an opportunity to 
stare this gift horse straight in the kisser. 
</P>
<P>
What they will see is a virtually flawless trove installed with such grateful 
reverence, it's enough to make you smile. The Pollock -- a classic 1949 drip 
painting called "Number 1" -- has a wall entirely to itself. As you look at it 
you can hear an awed and tremulous curatorial voice whisper, "And this . . . is 
our Pollock." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. No contemporary museum can regard itself as complete without an 
obligatory memento from the artist who managed to redefine painting after 
Picasso had apparently done it all. But this is no third-tier relic; it's a 
helluva picture with its tangled skeins of color electrified by crazy 
arabesques of white and silver. At different instants it looks like brambles, 
liquids and galaxies, but mostly it just looks like this amazing man-made thing 
that is like nothing ever made before it. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I ever saw a Pollock I just burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Turn around and there is a Piet Mondrian, a little 1939 job called "Composition 
of Red, Blue, Yellow." Actually, it's mainly a black-and-white grid with the 
colors squeezed off to the corners. It's so simple, but the interrelationships 
of rectangles set up fugal vibrations. You begin to understand that modernism 
was about the adventure of stripping art down to its barest essentials to 
discover the wonderful resonances of basic axioms. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the gallery housing the Schreiber donation, you have to walk through 
two others. One houses a roomful of pile-driver Franz Klines that are sort of 
like great jazz drum solos. The other has some big Mark Rothkos that throb with 
colors as dense as passages from Beethoven. Part of an earlier purchase from 
the Panza collection, they are intensely impressive. The mind says, "Hey, this 
is a serious museum." 
</P>
<P>
You walk into the Schreiber room and the mind does a double take. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, this is a really serious museum." 
</P>
<P>
The donation has vintage examples of classic modernism that are just what was 
needed to give the permanent collection a certain, well, gravitas. The ensemble 
has a golden spike quality that seems to anchor the institution. And it's 
instructively installed. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner there is an Alexander Calder sculpture and paintings by Joan Miro 
and Arshile Gorky that are like some great triple home run. Miro bashes the 
surrealist ball molding it into a funny kidney shape that makes it possible to 
be abstract and figurative at the same time. Calder -- on third -- slides into 
home plate shaping it into a biomorphic sculpture that is at once elegant, 
ominous and funny. Arshile Gorky races in from second (in New York), trips over 
Calder, making the base moist and sexy, thereby setting up the sensual, highly 
physical qualities of Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
Hold on fans! It's turning into a quadruple play! Mark Rothko turns the ball 
into a football and from a solid to a liquid, then sneaks it to Morris Louis 
who turns it into a liquid solid. Amazing. First time in history anybody ever 
batted in three home runs and made two touchdowns in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
The gift horse grins broadly. We search somewhat 
</P>
<P>
frantically for a yellow stain or two. Well isn't it a bit of an outrage that 
the little Mark Tobey isn't hanging closer to the Pollock for comparison? And 
isn't it a tragedy that the George Rickey mobile isn't moving and that it isn't 
close to the Calder, being that Rickey is Calder's finest and most underrated 
inheritor? 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK, so it's not exactly a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Not every work in the gift is a blockbuster or every artist a great master. On 
evidence, that just shows that the Schreibers collected for personal reasons 
and knew how to pick prime works by lesser known people. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't usually seem to matter that Pierre Alechinsky is far less revered 
here than in Europe, but the Schreibers found a wild little painting that shows 
him at his best. We tend to forget about Nicholas de Stael because he died 
early and leaned to decoration, but there is real poignancy in the three works 
here. The Dubuffet is unpretentious but captures the kernel of his Art Brut. 
</P>
<P>
None of that needs making up for, but if it did the Giacomettis would do it. 
Frankly, the artist is sometimes a bit too steeped in the celebration of 
European ennui and Angst but the two "Tall Figures" here find him at his best 
moment after the surrealist period. Nearly eight feet tall, each depicts a 
nubile young woman. Instead of the expected Lolita qualities we get spectral 
presences that impart serious thoughts about human vulnerability and its 
persistent tendency to triumph over its own weakness. 
</P>
<P>
For once everything went right. The Schreiber gift is unalloyed philanthropy in 
an era of shameless greed, artistic authenticity in an age of brass. Wow.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Warhol works disappoint - New York Art Auctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE biggest art sales of the year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
of impressionist, modern, and contemporary paintings and sculpture -
produced mixed fortunes for Sotheby's and Christie's in the opening two
sessions in New York this week, writes Antony Thorncroft.
Sotheby's sold only 53 per cent of the 78 lots on offer by value, for a
total of Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 5.7m). There was negligible bidding. The great
disappointment was Andy Warhol - with only two of 12 paintings by him
finding buyers. 'Old Telephone', painted in 1961, made Dollars 552,500,
below estimate.
It was a bad evening for Mr Charles Saatchi, who was trying to sell his
version of Carl Andre's bricks, 'Equivalent VI'. The Tate Gallery has never
been forgiven for paying Pounds 6,000 for Equivalent VIII, another group of
firebricks by Andre, but the price now looks cheap. Mr Saatchi was hoping
for Dollars 300,000 for his version; in the event they failed to sell.
Paintings by Franz Kline and Clyfford Still, both of which were expected to
top Dollars 1m, were also not sold. The more experimental sculpted works did
best, with auction records for Mark di Suvero's creation of weathered
timber, rope and nails (which fetched Dollars 470,000), and for Donald
Judd's construction of 10 stainless steel units fitted to a wall at six-inch
intervals (Dollars 233,500).
In contrast, Christie's was encouraged by its Tuesday auction, selling all
the top lots. The most important contemporary painting on offer this week,
'Number 19, 1948' by the leading abstract expressionist artist Jackson
Pollock, in which he dripped and poured paint on to the canvas, sold for
Dollars 2.42m, slightly above its top estimate, to a private European
collector.
A 1967 painting by Francis Bacon, 'Study for a portrait in a revolving
chair', was on target at Dollars 1.2m, while 'White Brushstroke I' by Roy
Lichtenstein, in which he parodied the spontaneous brush stroke which
characterised abstract expressionism, made Dollars 728,500.
There was keen bidding by European and American private collectors at the
Christie's auction. Other names to sell were Robert Rauschenberg, whose
'Nettle' fetched Dollars 717,500, and Jasper Johns, whose 1980 'Untitled'
realised Dollars 607,500.
The prices are well below levels of four years ago but they suggest that
more modest estimates attract buyers back to the market.

FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: A Contemporary gamble - New York Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOMAN POTTERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO SAYS that the market for Contemporary Art is in deep, deep trouble?
Listen to this for Christie's description of what it is selling New York
next week: 'A pantheon of the greatest Abstract Expressionist and Pop
artists represented by museum-quality works, many coming from distinguished
private collections. Reflecting a market trend, the traditional evening sale
of Contemporary Art now includes a broader range of artists and estimates to
accommodate a wider group of collectors.' Let's be honest, Christie's has
style.
At its big sale of Contemporary Art in New York this time last year, it sold
11 works for more than Dollars 1m and established record prices at auction
for ten different artists. Next week if it is lucky, it will manage to get
five paintings over the Dollars 1m mark and of those, only two - a Twombly
and a Kline - are likely to make more than a couple of million. And what of
records? Franz Kline's 'West Brand' is its main hope with an estimate of
Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m. If that goes past Dollars 2.86m which is the record
for Kline, then it will have one record.
Among this year's 'broader range' are many such works including an
attractive Motherwell of 1975, 'Pas de Deux, no 3', which is estimated at
Dollars 70,000-Dollars 90,000; it belongs to John Kluge, who is also selling
a Jackson Pollock (estimated Dollars 3-Dollars 500,000) and a Richard Linder
(estimate Dollars 1-Dollars 150,000).
With the free-fall in prices for works by Contemporary artists, some names
have held up better than others. Franz Kline is one of them; de Kooning,
Philip Guston and Cy Twombly are others. Christie's, taking care not to
flood the market, has one example by all these painters next week. One other
major painting on offer at Christie's is 'Bait' - a coloured silkscreen with
oil on canvas by Robert Rauschenberg (estimate Dollars 1.8-Dollars 2.5m).
The market's feelings about Rauschenberg are uncertain. Sotheby's had a
major painting by him in its sale last November. Although that sale was not
a success - 56 per cent of the lots were bought in and works by many big
names were left on the block - the Rauschenberg did sell. It brought Dollars
3.08m, but that was a good Dollars 1m less than the present estimate of
Dollars 4-Dollars 5m. Nevertheless, Rauschenberg is the main hope at
Sotheby's again next week. An important mixed media and collage on canvas,
'Rebus', that dates from 1955 is estimated at Dollars 4-Dollars 6m. This was
sold at the Victor Ganz sale in November 1988 when it was bought by the
Swedish collector, Hans Thulin, for a hefty Dollars 6.33m - a record for
Rauschenberg that still remains. It is estimated at a lower Dollars
4-Dollars 6m in next week's sale and it is being sold 'By order of the
Creditor' of a Scandinavian Private Collector: Mr Thulin one presumes.
This is not the sort of deal the auction houses like. It spells out in
easily understood Wall Street terms exactly what has happened to the market:
has Rauschenberg gone up or down? Whether the Rauschenberg in question is
good, bad or indifferent is neither here nor there; it was never acquired
for that reason.
After Rauschenberg, the next most important paintings at Sotheby's - at
least the most expensive - are two works by Twombly. These come from the
Saatchi Collection and their sale is part of a discreet dispersal process of
works from that collection which has caused ripples in the market over the
past year. Saatchi is also selling a Philip Guston of 1976 (estimated
Dollars 700,000-Dollars 750,000) as well as pictures by other artists.
These are all 'hot' names and many people have a vested interest in seeing
that prices for their work hold up. They, as much as 'the wider group of
collectors' whom Christie's is expecting are the ones who may be bidding
next week and for very good reason. If we see new records - or even high
prices - for new names, expect to see more of those artists in auctions next
Fall. Don't ask who is selling and never ask who is buying but beware:
today's market for Contemporary Art is for specialists - and not necessarily
art specialists.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Getting up from the canvas: A recovery in the market for
contemporary art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christie's sale of contemporary art in New York on Tuesday evening was a
tense affair. The market had been in free fall for almost three years. The
value of even major works by well respected artists had virtually halved.
Yet Christie's was offering an important composition by Andy Warhol, '210
Coca-Cola Bottles', a painting depicting seven rows of bottles stencilled on
to a silkscreen, with a hefty estimate of up to Dollars 2.8m.
Warhol's prices have fluctuated markedly since his death in 1987. And
although its early date, 1962, made the work important, the general feeling
was that Christie's, and the vendor, Martin Blinder, whose recession-hit
company sells art in shopping malls, had over-reached themselves.
In the event, bidding was brisk, with four potential buyers. The work was
finally sold to the Zurich dealer Thomas Ammann for Dollars 2m, well below
estimates but still a weighty price for Warhol, whose long-term reputation
is far from established. Christie's gamble had paid off and the market for
contemporary art, the most fickle sector of the arts trade, had given clear
signs of recovery.
'I am more than fairly pleased,' said Christie's expert Diane Upright after
the New York sale. Along with her rival Lucy Mitchell-Innes at Sotheby's she
had succeeded during the week in re-establishing a solidly based market in
contemporary art.
Prices may be considerably reduced on 1990 levels but at least there were
buyers, mainly American and European private collectors, for the select lots
which had been allowed to appear at the rostrum.
By concentrating on paintings that had not been on offer for many years,
that were in good condition and carrying low reserves, Christie's managed to
sell 82 per cent by value of its 67 lots for a total of Dollars 11.26m.
Sotheby's received Dollars 12.3m from 56 lots, and sold 76 per cent of its
works.
Both salerooms were lucky as well as bold. They each had an important seller
keen to dispose of desirable paintings at low prices. Sotheby's were
marketing a series of works owned by Charles Saatchi, co-founder of Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, and the dominant force in the contemporary
art market for over a decade. He is currently jettisoning important works by
artists he helped to popularise in the early 1980s so as to acquire the art
of a later generation as well as the occasional modern masterpiece. Saatchi
can afford to accept low prices since he bought the works for very modest
sums.
His imprimatur ensured that 'Bob's World', an early 'plate' composition (in
which broken plates are stuck to the canvas to create a greater physical
impact) by the controversial Julian Schnabel, sold for Dollars 319,000.
Other Saatchi paintings to sell included one of Cy Twombly's many 'Untitled'
canvases, bought by Saatchi's dealer Larry Gagosian for Dollars 1.65m, and
Dollars 627,000 for a pastiche of the Old Master Vermeer by the British
artist Malcolm Morley.
This was an auction record for Morley and underlined the growing
internationalism in the market for contemporary art. Traditionally,
Americans bought the abstract expressionism of the post-war New York
artists; Germans the work of their painters like Baselitz, Kiefer, and
Richter; and the French stuck with the Paris School. Now artists can cross
borders much more easily. Significantly, this week's sales brought the first
purchases from Taiwan, although the Japanese dealers, who entered this
market at its 1989 peak, were conspicuously absent.
Christie's sale centred on the works of Frederik Roos, the Swedish financier
who established his collection during the 1980's and who bought widely from
artists of various nationalities.
Roos died last year, aged 40 and loaded with debt, and Christie's has the
challenge of disposing of his collection. It has the advantage of
negotiating with a deceased estate, which helped it force low estimates and
reserves on the art. But even so, Christie's was amazed at its success in
marketing 188 of the best Roos acquisitions.
Virtually all were sold, for a total of Dollars 7.8m. Work by English
sculptors patronised by Roos, such as Tony Cragg and Barry Flanagan, sold
for auction record prices - Dollars 99,000 for a Cragg composition of three
giant bronze canisters, and Dollars 93,500 for a Flanagan bronze of one hare
balancing another on its nose.
Internationalism is not completely established - Sotheby's failed to sell
Saatchi's important nude portrait by Lucian Freud, 'Night Interior',
probably because the estimate of Dollars 500,000 was excessive for an artist
not well known in the US - but it is the best hope for the market's future.
For contemporary art still faces problems. There was very little buying this
week by dealers, who are sitting on enormous bank overdrafts in unvisited
galleries with vaults full of over-priced pictures.
And the main reason that the auctions were successful was that Sotheby's and
Christie's had fixed reserves even lower than those at last November's
auctions.
The market is in convalescence and is still far from buoyant. It was
noticeable that neither owners nor auction houses were willing to risk the
great icons of modern art - works by Jasper Johns or Jackson Pollock, de
Kooning or Lichtenstein, were not on offer this week.
Diane Upright reckons that the top price that anyone is currently prepared
to pay for a painting by a modern master is Dollars 10m. Three years ago a
de Kooning, 'Interchange', sold for Dollars 20.678m to a Japanese buyer and
a Jasper Johns, 'False Start', changed hands for Dollars 17m.
As the international economy moves out of recession, dealers and collectors
expect that the contemporary art market should continue to recover from its
sickbed. In any event, it will not lose its ability to shock.
The artist in keenest demand, whose prices have continued to rise during the
recession, is Robert Gober. His speciality is making creations of urinals,
beds, and, in particular, kitchen sinks. One of his beds, composed of
enamel, wood, cotton and wool, soared above its estimate on Tuesday to make
a record Dollars 180,000 - but also to create new doubts about the aesthetic
value of contemporary art.

<TEXT>
   William Stanley Hayter, an English-born painter
sought by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali for his
innovative printmaking techniques, died of cardiac arrest at age
86, it was reported today.
   Hayter, who died Wednesday in Paris, was a leading figure in the
Paris art scene for more than half a century.
   The Paris-based International Herald Tribune said in today's
editions that Hayter was credited with turning engraving into a
lively and experimental form that brought many famous artists to
work alongside him in his studio in Montparnasse.
   Among those artists who visited him at his studio, known as
Atelier 17, were Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jackson Pollock,
Dali and Picasso.
   Hayter was born in London in 1901 and graduated from Kings
College, London, with honor degrees in art and chemistry. He worked
in Iran from 1922 to 1925 for the Anglo-Iranian oil company but his
first interest was art.
   ``My father was a painter and a lot of people in my family
before, so I was messing about with painting fairly seriously when
I was a child. I was painting all the time when I was in the
(Middle) East,'' Hayter once said. ``I didn't do much with prints
till I came to Paris.''
   He quickly discovered and revolutionized the vanishing art of
original printmaking, bringing new techniques to the medium
including a method of color printing from a single plate instead of
having a separate plate for each tone.
   Hayter wrote two books that are essential reading for
printmakers, ``New Ways of Gravure'' (1949) and ``About Prints''
(1962).
   He lived in Paris from 1926 to 1939, then went to New York,
where he established his studio at the New School and gave an
impetus to American printmaking. He returned to Paris in 1950.

ART: A FRANKENTHALER RETROSPECTIVE OPENS SUNDAY AT LACMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist Helen Frankenthaler's mystique seems to be partly based on staying out 
of the limelight. Among art world insiders, she is almost as well known for 
living a privileged, quiet life on Manhattan's Upper East Side as for her 
lyrical abstract canvases. But since last June, when Frankenthaler's 
retrospective exhibition opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, she 
has been in the public eye almost constantly. 
</P>
<P>
The traveling exhibition, which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
on Sunday, set off an avalanche of profiles and reviews in newspapers and 
magazines. The 61-year-old artist has also turned up in less predictable 
forums. As a member of the National Endowment for the Arts advisory council, 
she responded last July to the controversy over Robert Mapplethorpe's and 
Andres Serrano's work by advocating "quality control." In a New York Times 
commentary, Frankenthaler took the unpopular position of worrying that the 
council might have begun to "spawn an art monster" while "endorsing 
experimentation." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, photographs of a youthful Frankenthaler and accounts of her 
associations with New York School artists cropped up in a controversial new 
biography on Jackson Pollock by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. And the 
February issue of Art &amp; Antiques magazine features Frankenthaler cheerfully 
posing in a Rolex ad. 
</P>
<P>
Has la grande dame, arguably America's most famous living female artist, let 
down her guard? Probably not. In Los Angeles for the opening of her show at 
LACMA, Frankenthaler was very much the well-bred, immaculately groomed woman 
who is unfailingly polite while measuring what she says to the press. She 
formed sentences slowly, answered questions concisely and almost never picked 
up an invitation to expand on any particular point. 
</P>
<P>
Painful as this public process may be, Frankenthaler seems to suffer none of 
the tyranny that is often attributed to artists' retrospectives. "I don't think 
a retrospective is a finality, it's a summing up, an opportunity to see where 
you have been and where you will go from there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed both with my first retrospective, at the Whitney Museum of American 
Art in 1969, and the current one that I made many discoveries. They had to do 
with the continuity of my painting but they also gave a clue to things that 
could be developed further." 
</P>
<P>
This second retrospective opened a full 20 years after the first, and 
Frankenthaler is already looking forward to the third. "I hope there will be a 
next one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest daughter of Alfred Frankenthaler, a New York State Supreme Court 
judge, Frankenthaler attended the Dalton school in New York, where she studied 
with Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, and Bennington College in Vermont. As a 
young painter in New York, she was championed by the influential critic Clement 
Greenberg, with whom she was romantically involved. Later married to painter 
Robert Motherwell, she forged a distinctive identity and has never wavered from 
her course. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenthaler's "soak-stain" abstractions of the early '50s are considered a 
link between Abstract Expressionism and the color-field movement of the '60s. 
Picking up on Pollock's energetically dripped paintings, she began to pour 
pigment on her canvases and let it soak into the fabric, creating soft-edged 
bursts of pastel color. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenthaler's retrospective at the County Museum of Art includes about 40 
works done between 1952 and 1988. The show begins with her most famous early 
painting, "Mountains and Sea" (a pale 1952 work that looked like a paint rag to 
some observers but impressed critic Greenberg and artists Kenneth Noland and 
Morris Louis as a breakthrough), and ends with the ominously dark "Casanova" of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when art changes almost as often as clothing styles, Frankenthaler 
seems unconcerned about being up-to-date. Securely rooted in Abstract 
Expressionism, the style that established American art on an international 
stage, she values a historical view of art. "Young artists should have an idea 
of the importance of Abstract Expressionism, just as I should have a sense of 
my heritage. I think the importance of Abstract Expressionism has to be a major 
consideration in where art went from there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for where she thinks art actually has gone, Frankenthaler is diplomatically 
silent, saying only that much current work is "fashion." She also prefers not 
to expound on the artists and works that influenced her. "Paintings speak for 
themselves, the good ones," she said, then ticked off a list: Pollock, 
Motherwell, Noland, Louis, David Smith, Anthony Caro, Adolph Gottlieb, "early 
Willem de Kooning" and "certain paintings" by Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who supported these artists' work, is a great critic, Frankenthaler 
thinks. "Everything he has written is extremely valuable, and it is written in 
such a way that will hold up well into the future. You can't say that about 
very many writers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Naifeh's and Smith's biography of Pollock takes a dissenting view of Greenberg. 
"I haven't read the book thoroughly, but I think it is unfortunately dedicated 
to entertainment rather than factual history. I always slightly cringe at the 
idea that Van Gogh, Gauguin and now Pollock are material for mega-movies. They 
should be represented by their best work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankenthaler retrospective will be at LACMA through April 22, then travel 
to the Detroit Institute of Art, June 11 through Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit appearance doubtless will call for another round of interviews, but 
Frankenthaler has her mind on other projects now. She recently signed three new 
prints produced at Tyler Graphics in Mount Kisco, N.Y., an April show of her 
recent works of paper is scheduled at Manhattan's Andre Emmerich Gallery and 
she is working on a catalogue raisonne of her graphics that she hopes to 
complete in 1991.

Philip and Beatrice Gersh collect art for an old-fashioned reason: They love 
the stuff. And they deal with their most valuable possessions in an 
old-fashioned way: They give them away. 
</P>
<P>
As owner of a long-established talent agency and a collector for 35 years, 
Philip Gersh has had calls from studio executives seeking advice on how to 
invest in art. His answer: "We don't buy that way. You have to buy because you 
love the art. If you are concerned about liquidity and investment, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
He and and his wife, who is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art, are 
dismayed by wealthy collectors who cash in on their art at auction. "They don't 
need the money," Philip Gersh scoffed. "You hear that certain pieces have 
become too valuable to keep in private collections. If the art is so valuable, 
it should be given to museums. The more valuable it is, the more reason that a 
museum should have it." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, before the art market zoomed into the stratosphere and before 
the 1986 income-tax law reduced art donors' deductions to the purchase price of 
an artwork, instead of the appreciated price, the Gershes' attitude toward 
their collection was relatively commonplace. But the new tax law has reduced 
gifts of art to museums by 63%, a study by the Assn. of Art Museum Directors 
shows. At the same time, rising prices have shut museums out of the market. 
With paintings going for $20 million, $30 million, $40 million or even $50 
million a pop at auction, generosity seems to be an idea whose time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the ethic of philanthropy an archaic notion? I'm afraid that's about 90% 
accurate," Philip Gersh said. That fear is part of the reason for a current 
show of the Gersh collection at the Museum of Contemporary Art. The exhibition 
at MOCA (to March 11) includes eight works that the Gershes have given or 
promised to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among them is "Cubi III," an 8-foot-tall aluminum sculpture by David 
Smith, whose works have brought as much as $1.3 million at auction. When the 
show opened, the 1961 sculpture was promised to the museum, but the couple have 
subsequently made a "partial gift" of the valuable work and have agreed to give 
the piece entirely to MOCA soon. 
</P>
<P>
The towering sculpture -- which is one of two "Cubi" pieces still in private 
hands -- is essential to a contemporary art museum's collection, MOCA director 
Richard Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Another "partial gift" from the Gershes is "Number 3," a small 1948 drip 
painting by Jackson Pollock, whose auction record is $10.5 million. The other 
Gersh gifts are less pricey but highly desirable acquisitions for the museum: a 
mixed-media collage by Alexis Smith, a photograph by Boyd Webb and paintings by 
Ed Ruscha, Susan Rothenberg, Neil Jenney and Tom Wudl. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes hope that MOCA's show of their collection will encourage others to 
give. Their example has already produced at least two followers: their sons 
Robert and David Gersh who collect contemporary art and support the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting has enriched our lives," Beatrice Gersh said. "Art is not a 
commodity. It's something that gives great pleasure because of its quiet 
beauty, which can take many different forms. We feel strongly that the works we 
have should live together in our home and we've spent many years refining the 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Every work that has become part of their collection has a life story. Wandering 
around the show and marveling at how different the art looks in a museum 
setting, the Gershes recounted tales of artworks bought in a fit of passion and 
others purchased after long periods of deliberation, dusty artworks rescued 
from storage bins and fresh ones snapped off delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
There are also stories about artworks lost and gained. One dealer reneged on 
the sale of a Jean Dubuffet collage when a more valued client wanted it, but 
then came through with a better piece. Beatrice Gersh once missed a Francis 
Bacon painting because her husband found it too disturbing, she said. Years 
later, when she saw Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" in a London show, 
she announced that she wouldn't leave the gallery until they bought it. The 
small 1963 portrait is on view at MOCA in an intimate display of works by 
20th-Century masters. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early years Bea was way ahead of me, but now our eyes have adjusted to 
the point that we often go for exactly the same thing," Philip Gersh said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was ahead it's only because I devoted more time to it," Beatrice Gersh 
said. "One problem with many collectors starting out now is that they don't 
have any idea of the past and how it relates to the art of our time. You have 
to put in a lot of time, going to galleries and museums, looking and getting 
trained." 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes have never employed a curator or an adviser to tell them what to 
buy. Instead, they have taken their own education in hand, traveling widely to 
see exhibitions and continually working to keep up with the changing scene. 
</P>
<P>
They stand out as a rare example of public-spirited collectors, but they are 
not entirely alone in Los Angeles. Earlier this year, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art received a $60-million donation of classic modern and 
contemporary art from the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection. Among the 18 
works by 13 artists are paintings by Pollock, Mark Rothko, Piet Mondrian and 
Arshile Gorky, and sculpture by Alberto Giacometti. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, MOCA has also received works by Christian 
Boltanski and Sarah Charlesworth from Peter and Eileen Norton; a John 
Chamberlain sculpture from Robert Halff; and Red Grooms' near life-size 
re-creation of a "Discount Store" from Irma and Norman Braman. Among other 
gifts, MOCA trustees Eli Broad and Douglas S. Cramer have each donated funds 
for the purchase of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art also has angels who remain devoted despite 
current tax laws. Pop singer Graham Nash recently announced that he will 
present the museum with about 140 photographs, plus half the profits from an 
upcoming auction of his photography collection. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond and Frances Bushell have donated 141 Japanese netsuke as part of a 
larger miniature sculpture collection promised to the county museum. Mary 
Stansbury Ruiz bequeathed more than 600 Mannerist prints to LACMA, while Hans 
and Varya Cohn have donated more than 200 examples of ancient, Sasanian, 
Islamic and Indian glass. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors Howard and Gwen Laurie Smits in 1987 gave the museum 171 
contemporary ceramic works and subsequently established an endowment fund for 
the purchase of 20th-Century ceramics. In making the gift, the Smits said that 
the donation was the best way to make "maximum use" of their collection. 
</P>
<P>
Film producer Ray Stark last year gave the museum Ellsworth Kelly's "White 
Sculpture II," a massive painted aluminum piece. "I have another one and I 
thought this sculpture would go well with the museum's collection," Stark said. 
Denying that he has "great altruistic motivations," Stark nonetheless said that 
he plans to give most of his sculpture collection to the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shame that the government discourages gifts of art. I can 
understand people who don't want to give now (under present tax laws), but my 
personal feeling is that eventually I would like most of my sculpture to go to 
the museum," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes, like many other museum supporters, hope that income tax laws will 
be changed again to allow deductions for the appreciated value of art. "All our 
great museums have been endowed by great private collectors. The Reagan and 
Bush administrations have emphasized the responsibility of the private sector, 
but private collectors are selling at auction now -- and at astronomical 
prices," Philip Gersh said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple used to buy at auction, when bargains could be had, but now they 
stay away. And they entertain no thoughts of cashing in. "We're very happy in 
giving. We know people are going to enjoy the art," Beatrice Gersh said.

EXHIBITION AT LACMA SHOWS THE GREAT REGIONALIST ONCE AGAIN IS SPEAKING TO 
AEMRICANS

<P>
The decade ended, the world seemed to crumble like a chimney falling in slow 
motion. The wreckage revealed grimy scraps of gilt-edged securities, broken 
bottles of bathtub gin, the fender of a yellow Stutz Bearcat -- detritus of 
good times gone. Bony derelicts would soon rummage in the rubble to a harmonica 
tune asking, "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? " 
</P>
<P>
When the market crashed in '29 people got scared of racy ideas that had fueled 
their roaring decade in the same way they would get scared again at the end of 
the '60s. Have we gone too far? Is all this misery God's punishment for the 
hooch, the easy sex and rebellion against The Establishment? Neoconservative 
nervousness set in as it did again in the '80s traumatized over drugs, and AIDS 
and longing for the simple solutions of the old-time religion. The '20s had 
Father Coughlin, we had Rev. Falwell. They had the Scopes trial, we have 
abortion rights wrangles. Whatever, it's still religion vs. science. Our 
legions of homeless and economic uncertainties are like theirs, except, of 
course, we don't have a Depression. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was international then, too. In Paris, Picasso started painting in his 
Neo-Classical manner. England looked at the discouraged realism of Gwen John 
and Walter Sickert. Hitler replaced modernism with Fascist Realism. Abstract 
art, associated with left-wing radicalism, was on the run. In the United 
States, the new hero was Thomas Hart Benton. His big, ropy murals depicting 
hillbillies and good old boys and girls of Heartland America reassured people 
that Yankee values were safe as strongboxes. Now once again we find easily 
accessible art agreeable. We have David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art opens a revivalist retrospective of 
Benton's art. It manages to be artistically absorbing despite the necessary 
absence of his major works, the unmoveable murals. More importantly, it feels 
less like an art exhibition than the point in a historical cycle where the 
vectors of past and present come together -- making new beginnings possible. 
There is something quite awesome about it. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that would make its significance clearer would be a back-to-back 
retrospective of the art of Jackson Pollock. Pollock is the invisible actor 
whose specter establishes the broader significance of this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was Pollock's teacher, mentor, surrogate father and drinking buddy at 
New York's Art Student's League in the early '30s. The fact has long been 
known. Until now the relationship tended to be characterized as one where 
Pollock rebeled against a fuddy-duddy teacher. Today it looks different, thanks 
to the exemplary Benton catalogue by Henry Adams and to a controversial recent 
Pollock biography widely read in art circles, "Jackson Pollock: An American 
Saga" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. Rolled together, the two books 
and the exhibition show that Benton and his art were intensely modern at bottom 
and that Pollock and his art would have been all but impossible without the 
older man. 
</P>
<P>
There was indeed a kind of mythic Oedipal struggle between them but it was less 
personal than generational, a fact that links both to the larger history of 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Benton led an artificially manufactured back-to-the-roots art movement called 
Regionalism whose other heroes were Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry. People 
loved Benton's salty, pugnacious manner and wrangled delightedly over bold 
murals his detractors called "tabloid art." He once admitted, "I paint 
sometimes to get people to criticize my work." He was so popular in 1934 he 
became the first artist ever to make the cover of Time magazine, leading Andy 
Warhol by decades with an artistic career fueled by publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest Bentons on view at LACMA prove him both talented and urbane. His 
Huck Finn image was always something of a pose. Born in Neosho, Miss., he was 
the great-nephew of Sen. Thomas Hart Benton. His father was an abusive, macho 
local politician who married an ambitious young beauty who goaded the old man 
into running for Congress. He won and young Tom grew up as much in the 
political climate of Washington as anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, he went to Paris where he kept a mistress until his mother came and 
broke it up. He painted his sister Mildred in a realist style with a whiff of 
Gustav Klimt. He worked in the manner of Cezanne, the Impressionists and in the 
abstract "Synchronist" style of his imperious pal Stanton MacDonald Wright. A 
handsome late portrait shows real affection and admiration for his difficult 
old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Serious family financial reverses forced his return to the States. He settled 
into his Hopeful Years in New York where he married Rita Piacenza, who suffered 
his egotism with good grace. She manipulated his career like a maestro. 
Traumatized by the death of his father, he started disappearing on long trips 
into Missouri and the Ozarks. He discovered the Italian 16th-Century mannerist 
Tintoretto. Benton absorbed his style and his method of working from clay 
models. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was meticulous in his working habits. From all this he developed the 
distinctive regionalist style that critics scorned for its Old Master sources. 
Delacroix and Gericault are already in "People of Chilmark." Later, you can see 
the influence of Brueghel and the Flemish Primitives. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of World War II it was all over for Benton. His agrarian America was 
swamped by industrialized suburbia just as today mighty industry has become the 
rust belt and technology is king. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was relegated to the status of a colorful has-been. He was accused of 
being a fascist, even though, in truth, he was a left-wing populist. Then, as 
now, his wrangles with fellow artists such as his arch enemy Stuart Davis took 
on nasty political overtones. In fact, it was only a territorial battle between 
abstract and figurative art, which were seen, respectively, as liberal and 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was accused of being a racist. His paintings of blacks have an element 
of caricature but so do his paintings of everybody. The racist thing rubbed off 
on him from his friend, the critic Thomas Craven, who called photographer and 
Modernist entrepreneur Alfred Stieglitz "a Hoboken Jew without knowledge of or 
interest in the historical American background." 
</P>
<P>
What is true is that Benton was an enthusiastic boozer who -- although married 
with children -- harbored deeply mixed feelings about women and despised 
homosexuals, especially of the arty sort. 
</P>
<P>
When he left New York, disgusted, to return to Missouri in 1935 he wrote, "If 
young gentlemen or old ones either want to wear women's underwear and cultivate 
extraordinary manners it is all right with me. But it is not all right with the 
art they affect and cultivate." 
</P>
<P>
By the '50s, art students were trained to put Benton in the same category of 
popular-artists-to-be-scorned as Norman Rockwell and Andrew Wyeth. Benton, the 
man, hung on until 1975 when he died of a heart attack in his Kansas City 
studio. At 85, he was enjoying something of a revival and had just completed a 
big mural called "The Sources of Country Music." 
</P>
<P>
But the art world's new hero was Pollock. Surely he had learned some of his 
surly macho behavior from Benton. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition makes Benton's fundamental modernity inescapable. A set of large 
studies for "The American Historical Epic" reminds us of El Greco but basically 
the work could not have happened without Cubism. Benton articulated his space 
with curved lines that unite compositions like the snake in the "Laocoon." 
Forms are sculptural but everything pops to the surface as one big 
claustrophobic arabesque. That's where Pollock comes in. He had to have seen 
these pictures and subconsciously transferred the nervous dynamism of their 
basic composition to his famous "drip" paintings. Pollock and Benton shared a 
common compulsiveness. Tom's was wound up tight, Jackson's explosive and 
Dionysiac. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's paintings could not have happened without that quintessential modern 
art form, the movies. There is something of the American pioneer films of Gary 
Cooper and Susan Hayward in the history cycle. "Boomtown" looks like the set 
for some oiler flick with Clark Gable. "Hollywood" is only one of the pictures 
he composed using a cinematic montage technique to cross-cut to related scenes. 
Later he painted Burt Lancaster in "The Kentuckian" and Marlon Brando in 
"Streetcar Named Desire." There's something odd about the whole concept, like a 
novel written after a film. Compared to Edward Hopper's brooding movie palace 
paintings, Benton's seem exhibitionistic and a little jealous. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Benton art comes on like a baroque freight train, it's curiously 
elusive emotionally. There is affection in it but it's like the work of a guy 
who always says, "I love you honey but your feet's too big." Mean around the 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
Benton evokes the whole generation of Depression-era artists from Gropper to 
Shahn and the Soyer brothers. Form is mangled and work seems as haunted as the 
period. A work like "The Hailstorm" is so nightmarish you want to call the 
style "Surregionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has really defined Regionalism according to the feelings it projects. 
It's haunted and inbred like meeting a small-town family whose good manners are 
all about hiding the skeletons in the closet. Benton did two big nudes in 
1938-39. "Persephone" and "Susanna and the Elders." Both deserve the 
contemporary description of one of the pictures as a "skinny-shanked, 
sex-starved Midwest teacher." 
</P>
<P>
In the catalogue Adams links them psychologically to Benton's beautiful 
antiseptic mother and his dirty old dad, but they take on other meanings -- the 
tainted voyeuristic snicker of Erskine Caldwell's novel, "God's Little Acre." 
They transfer Titian's grand manner European style to the Midwest and a great 
erotic tradition takes on a scolding, moralistic tone. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's art is neurotically modern, but it is also inescapable. It broadcasts 
a sense of authenticity to its times and its maker and lends credence to 
President Harry Truman's belief that Benton was "the best damn painter in 
America." His drawing was crabbed but amazingly accurate. He composed complex 
groups of figures with a unity and believability that remains unmatched. No 
artist today with pretensions to making a narrative art can touch him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how can you hate him? He once said in a public lecture that the tune 
"Pistol Packin' Mama" is "True art." 
</P>
<P>
Why is this important? After all art is just art and paintings is just 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Blissfully, that is what this exhibition and the books prove wrong. Anyone 
interested in culture will be well rewarded for taking the trouble to plow 
through their combined 1,147 pages. Each humanizes its subject while placing 
him in the context of those roiling, complex times surrounding the Great 
Depression. Their art becomes so clearly crucial to their historical moment 
that it is as impossible to imagine the time without them as without Franklin 
D. Roosevelt or Joe Louis. The art so clearly grows from the soil of real 
events that it seems epic. 
</P>
<P>
If all this fails to convince of the central creative and intellectual role of 
the artist in this culture, then it probably can't be done.

<HL> Christie's Sells Painting By Johns for $7 Million </HL>

<CO> U.CHR </CO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christie's sold a record $37.3 million of contemporary art at an auction last night, with the highest individual price, $7 million, going for a Jasper Johns painting. 

   In the packed sale room, records were set for 25 artists. 
The Johns painting, "White Flag," brought a record price for a work by a living artist. 

   The painting was bought by a private collector from Sweden, Hans Thulin, who said, "I consider this a very exceptional acquisition. 
It reflects my general belief that you can never pay too much for outstanding quality." 
Mr. Thulin said he is the sole owner and chairman of a Swedish real-estate conglomerate, Consolidator-Granaten Group. 

   Four works out of 86 didn't sell, a vast improvement from a sale at Christie's a year ago following the stock-market crash when one in four works didn't sell. 
Martha Baer, a head of 20-century art at Christie's, said most of the buying was done by U.S. collectors and added that the election didn't have any effect on the prices. 
"They were A-plus works by A-plus artists," said Ms. Baer. 

   The first 32 works came from an important collection assembled by Burton and Emily Hall Tremaine. 

   Artists for whom records were set included Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. 

   Christie's is a unit of London-based Christie's International PLC.

ANDY WARHOL &amp; COMPANY -- RETHINKING THE ART OF THE SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High name-recognition value certainly accompanies the show of early graphic 
work by the late Andy Warhol, which opens Sunday at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum. For an art that grew from advertising, it's only fitting. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Pop art of the 1960s remains among the most widely misunderstood 
artistic movements of the 20th Century. It certainly has enjoyed crowd-pleasing 
notoriety almost from the very start. But, maybe because of all that raucous 
public clamor, resistance to clear-eyed examination remains surprisingly 
strong. Pop easily bypassed slower traffic on the road to posterity, and 
annoyed the art world's mandarin gate-keepers no end. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest sign of the confusion is that the two most common readings of the 
art are completely contradictory to one another. With its soup cans, comic 
strips and sleek Hollywood glamour, Pop is claimed to be: a.) a buoyant 
celebration of the spectacular machinery of consumerism, advertising and all 
the new visual languages of mass culture; or b.) a withering critique of the 
vacant soul of consumerism, advertising and all the new visual languages of 
mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fool would deny that popular culture has something to do with Pop art. 
Only a fool could deny that art culture has something to do with it too. In 
fact, it's turning out that Pop's great triumph emerged from its purposeful 
inquiry into the gassy, suffocating rhetoric that characterized American 
painting by the end of the 1950s. Arriving at a moment of nerve-wracking 
vacancy in the precincts of culture, Pop art assumed the role of Abstract 
Expressionism's pointed nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
The great, sprawling retrospective of Andy Warhol's career mounted last year at 
New York's Museum of Modern Art offered one welcome occasion to rethink the Pop 
phenomenon. The mammoth show focused principally on Warhol's paintings of the 
1960s. Some people groused, complaining that even so large an exhibition drew 
an incomplete profile of its subject, but I thought the choice was just right. 
Warhol, still respected only grudgingly, needed to be emphatically represented 
at his peak. At the Modern, painting after painting from the 1960s made the 
brilliance of his work virtually inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
With its forceful emphasis, the show provided a perfect foil for still another 
shot of re-examination. The Grey Art Gallery at New York University assembled a 
compact survey of the dozen years Warhol worked as a prosperous commercial 
artist. Unexpectedly, this gathering of mostly 1950s magazine graphics, 
newspaper advertisements, menu illustrations, fabric motifs, record-album 
covers, book jackets, Christmas card designs and photographs of department 
store window-dressing treatments began to answer complex questions about where 
the great paintings of the 1960s, resplendently installed up the street at the 
Museum of Modern Art, had come from. "Success is a job in New York . . .: The 
Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" became the sleeper-hit of the Manhattan 
art season. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad the Warhol retrospective came nowhere near California on its 
international tour. "Success is a job in New York . . ." almost didn't make it, 
either. Thanks to some 11th-hour juggling, however, the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum was able to squeeze the show into its schedule (it will remain through 
March 18).

Miss the exhibition only at your peril, for lots of interesting points of 
convergence between Warhol in the 1950s and his Pop efflorescence in the 1960s 
await amiable discovery. The funniest is in a 1952 photograph of the 
24-year-old artist, made with his art-director friend, Otto Fenn. By 
overpainting with black ink, Warhol's profile is made sleek and model-handsome, 
transforming the ethnic features of his Czech ancestry into an All-American 
look. This wittily altered photograph anticipates by a decade the famous 
"Before and After" painting based on a plastic surgery advertisement for a nose 
job. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to think about Warhol's Pop art in relation to his commercial 
work of the previous decade is surely welcome. But try examining his commercial 
art while keeping the contemporaneous backdrop of Abstract Expressionism firmly 
in mind. Therein lies the key to understanding Pop. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that much Pop art of the early 1960s can be productively thought 
of as Abstract Expressionist ideas represented by commercial, graphic images. A 
gritty style of newspaper advertising is employed to that end, for example, in 
Roy Lichtenstein's 1962 paintings in the collection of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtenstein's "Meat" shows a cut of raw beef. "Strong Hand (The Grip)" shows 
muscle-building equipment. "Desk Calendar" shows a daily notebook with 
appointments logged. Together, these "raw, muscular, autobiographical" 
paintings compose an imagistic anthology of value-laden Abstract Expressionist 
language, concocted to describe the earlier paintings of Jackson Pollock, Franz 
Kline, Willem de Kooning and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Edward Ruscha. Also at MOCA is his 1962 "Annie," whose title is 
written in fluid maple syrup -- a drip-painting if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
As for Warhol, the critic Dave Hickey began a similar decoding in last summer's 
number of the quarterly magazine Parkett. Most famously, the nearly 
interchangeable splash-and-dribble of paint in late Abstract Expressionism was 
colloquially known as "soup" -- so commercial-artist Andy turned to Campbell's. 
</P>
<P>
The existential pain of the '50s became the spur for all manner of Andy's 
tabloid images of personal disaster -- "129 Die!" -- while his pictures of 
electric chairs pointedly included signs invoking Beckett's Silence. Pollock's 
romantic legend had been heroically capped when the automobile he was driving 
smashed into a tree, so Warhol painted car crashes. Marilyn, Jackie and Liz 
took turns playing the role of De Kooning's powerful women, while the energetic 
directive for the artist to get "inside" the painting, bodily, is played out as 
footstep-pictures of dance diagrams. 
</P>
<P>
Once you get the hang of it, you can find Ab-Ex cliches all over the Pop map. 
Off the top of my head, I'd add to Hickey's list Warhol's enormous paintings of 
flowers, taken from a garden photograph in a seed catalogue: With the old, 
abstract expanse of color across the canvas now replaced by grass and blossoms, 
they literally became the "field paintings" described in painterly rhetoric of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
The show coming to Newport Beach is fascinating because it puts the advertising 
processes of commercial art in the foreground, and they are at the core of 
Warhol's Pop strategy. His job, as a commercial artist, had been to find 
concise, compelling images with which to sell purely abstract concepts, such as 
"sophistication," "uniqueness" or "casual elegance." His new job, as a Pop 
artist, was to do the same for Abstract Expressionist concepts, such as "the 
tragic," "the sublime" or "the transcendent." 
</P>
<P>
Warhol's Pop sold the image of art -- or, more precisely, sold the reigning 
American image of art in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a generation after Abstract Expressionism's phenomenal rise to 
international prominence, it's hard to imagine just how inspiriting the 
situation must have been: For the first time, ever, an American artist could be 
of international consequence. 
</P>
<P>
At least, some could. In his memoirs, the art dealer John Bernard Myers tells 
of painter Helen Frankenthaler's calculating decision in 1958 suddenly to leave 
his gallery: Her new husband, the influential artist Robert Motherwell, did not 
approve of his wife being represented by a homosexual. And in the Grey Art 
Gallery catalogue, Trevor Fairbrother relates an incident in 1959 in which, for 
similar reasons, Warhol's paintings were rejected for a show at the prestigious 
Tanager Gallery: The macho, male-dominated milieu of the New York School, now 
legendary, couldn't exactly accommodate an effeminate gay fop like Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
The dissonance in "high art" subject matter shown as "low art" commercial 
imagery describes, in aesthetic terms, the conflict between Abstract 
Expressionism's grand, universalist rhetoric of existential freedom and the 
vulgar reality of its exclusionary social milieu. "Success is a job in New York 
. . ." reveals how Pop's most exalted subject is its eloquent drama of personal 
freedom.

ZAN THOMPSON: IN A CLASS BY THEMSELVES

<P>
The kindergartners came out of the double doors like flying pieces of popcorn. 
The first-graders with their superior experience and dignity came out like 
vestrymen, bent on a solemn task. They had all been in the same place -- at the 
Valentine School Art Show. 
</P>
<P>
This was the windup of a year's work in art, put together by the PTA at 
Valentine School, a public school in San Marino. This was the second year of 
the Art Festival, and it was a roaring success, especially with the young 
artists, who ranged from kindergarten to the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cindy Roe, whose son Trevor was a first-grader at Valentine, and 
some other mothers decided that the kids needed to learn something about art. 
"Art is not caught. It must be taught" became their rallying slogan. Because of 
school budget cuts that came from Sacramento, things thought of as frill 
courses had been eliminated. Roe and her co-chairwoman, Susie Bishop, 
determined that they would teach the kids something about art. 
</P>
<P>
Roe was an art history major at UCLA, and she was delighted to be able to do 
something with her knowledge that would enrich the kids. Roe and Bishop and 48 
PTA volunteers gave hundreds of hours of work to the classes. 
</P>
<P>
Each grade studies one facet of art at a time. 
</P>
<P>
In kindergarten, the children studied line, looking at pictures by Klee, 
Picasso, Miro and Mondrian. Then they painted their own pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The first grade studied shape, real and abstract, illustrated by the works of 
Rousseau, Cezanne and Matisse. 
</P>
<P>
In second grade, the subject was color, and how it changes the way we feel 
about a picture. The children were exposed to the works of Joshua Reynolds, 
Mary Cassatt, Mark Rothko, Georges Seurat and Gainsborough. The kids loved it 
more with every lesson. 
</P>
<P>
The third grade studied texture, both visual and tactile. There were lovely, 
knobby pictures, and satin smooth ones inspired by Van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, 
Monet, Rembrandt and the Cluny tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-graders studied form in sculpture and architecture. Roe said these 
classes were held out on the lawn, the biggest rather organized exercise in mud 
pie making in the land. And they learned about Michelangelo and Rodin. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-graders combined all of the elements of art in their work and learned 
about Gilbert Stuart, Andrew Wyeth, Edward Hopper and Severin Roesen. 
</P>
<P>
At the exhibit I met the school principal, an easy, charming lady named Mary 
Meye. She managed all year to keep the art display room off limits. Even on 
rainy days, when the classes usually have gym and recess inside, Meye saved the 
space for the art work and classes. To give a clear idea of how the lady 
thinks: Every room in the school has a large printed sign reading, "I will 
respect myself and others." Good tenet. 
</P>
<P>
Roe told me that the kids' excitement level stayed at the explosion point all 
year. Seeing what was on the wall by another class, they'd ask, "When do we get 
to do that?" They waited for class every week on the door sill and had to be 
scooted out when class was over. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, every child in school had at least one picture in the 
exhibition. The volunteers took the works home and mounted them on bright 
construction paper. Cindy Roe's husband, Richard, was willingly dragooned into 
putting up corkboard to display the pictures. He tricked up the entrance to the 
exhibit with stanchions and bright white chains and plywood painted like a 
Grecian portico with columns and an imposing lintel, and set the corkboards at 
angles to give the feeling of corridors. This made the kids feel as if they 
were going into a real art museum. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit opened with an evening reception for the artists. Roe also conjured 
up a money-raising fillip for the exhibit. She had packets of note paper 
printed, each one with a picture made by a young artist. One is after Georges 
Seurat -- pointillism by a second-grader of a man in a tall Sunday afternoon 
hat, standing against a dappled grassy bank under a blue sky and holding a 
lovely mandarin orange umbrella. Another card was done after the kids had seen 
Cezanne's "Tulips in the Vase." The third card was inspired by a Picasso of a 
hand holding a bunch of flowers. The fourth picture is a lovely, misty iris 
done in watercolor. 
</P>
<P>
Another Roe-Bishop production is an apron of heavy muslin with a strap around 
the neck. It is bright white, wildly speckled and sprayed. It was inspired the 
day the kids encountered Jackson Pollock. Across the top of the apron, it says, 
"You've got to have art." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time parents have pitched in at the school. Two years 
ago, the parents painted the outside of Valentine School from top to bottom in 
a testimonial to their determination that their children would not be 
shortchanged. They won't, as long as Roe and Bishop and their 48 compatriots 
are convinced that you've got to have art.

FT  06 MAY 94 / NY art auctions end hopes of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's New York auctions of leading works of contemporary art have
shattered some of the growing optimism that the international art and
antiques market was making a strong recovery.
At Sotheby's on Wednesday night the most important work on sale this week,
'Highway' by Jasper Johns, expected to make around Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.4m),
was unsold, while at Christie's on Tuesday almost half the lots on offer
failed to find buyers. This was a disappointment after the success of last
winter's contemporary auctions in New York.
Sotheby's had the better experience. Apart from the failure of the Johns the
auction did quite well, totalling almost Dollars 20.5m, and with over 70 per
cent of works on offer selling.
'Cubi V', a sculpture by David Smith, went to a private American collector
for a record Dollars 4m. It is one of a series of 28 such sculptures, most
of which are already in museums. 'Dark Green Painting' by Arshile Gorky, his
last important work before his death in 1948, made Dollars 3.5m. Both works
were sold from the collection of Mr and Mrs H. Gates Lloyd: he was the
former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
In contrast Christie's sold its main offering, a drip painting by Jackson
Pollock, for Dollars 1.76m. This was well below its Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m
estimate. It seems the good results last time round encouraged some leading
works into the saleroom, but with reserves higher than the market could
stand.

<P>
Don't breathe a word to the people of Cincinnati -- you might find yourself 
under indictment if you do -- but sex and sexuality have been central to art 
for at least 10,000 years, give or take a few. So let's talk about art and sex 
for a moment, and especially about art and the kind of sex that dares not speak 
its name. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to discern that the ballistic missiles 
launched against the art of the late Robert Mapplethorpe have been fueled by a 
loathing for homosexuality. The artist was openly gay, and his work includes 
frank pictures. The furious objection to federal funding of their display is 
that it constitutes inappropriate government sanction for homosexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is politics as usual. Nonetheless, something extraordinary is 
happening. The deftly orchestrated attack actually threatens to bring down an 
entire federal agency. The National Endowment for the Arts, whose whopping 
successes of the last 25 years stand virtually unparalleled amid the waste and 
corruption more typically left by bureaucracies, may not survive the year. 
</P>
<P>
By wide margins, polls show firm public support for federal funding of the 
arts, without content restrictions or direct congressional interference. Still, 
there's a good chance that the agency will be fatally compromised, if not 
destroyed outright. This sharply contradictory state of affairs demonstrates 
two things. One is the fearsome power of prejudice as a political tool in the 
United States today. The other is the special status of homosexuality in our 
nation's long and inglorious history of intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
The relationships between American art and the politics of repression as it 
pertains to homosexuality are only just beginning to be studied. The body of 
scholarship remains small and fragmented, and no comprehensive thesis has yet 
emerged. Sometimes, though, the chance juxtaposition of those fragments brings 
a slightly larger picture into view. 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely what has happened in the last several months. The accidental 
coming together in Southern California of two exhibitions that have been 
traveling the country since 1989 -- one featuring Thomas Hart Benton, the other 
Andy Warhol -- has conspired to tell us much about the history behind the 
travails of the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. Add the January publication of an unusually insightful biography of 
Jackson Pollock and a good deal of light has lately been shed. The sweep of 
half a century of American cultural life begins to take newly coherent shape. 
</P>
<P>
Visually, the work of these four artists couldn't be more diverse. But 
chronologically, they form a chain of unusual interest. From the 1930s to the 
1950s, Benton and Pollock are paradigms for the establishment of an American 
art scene that came from obscurity to international acclaim. From the 1960s to 
the 1980s, Warhol and Mapplethorpe were central participants in changing the 
direction of that art. The repression of sex and sexuality is pivotal to the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, "Thomas Hart Benton: An American 
Original" is a sprawling show. It chronicles the work of an artist who 
pompously cast himself as a modern Michelangelo for a democratic people but who 
in fact emerges as a skillful if unwitting caricaturist. 
</P>
<P>
Often hugely scaled, his mannered, cartoon-like paintings are chiefly of 
interest as a record of the sorrowful nightmare haunting the American spirit, 
especially during the traumatic years of the Great Depression. Benton climbed 
to prominence in that troubled time. His robust misogyny and outspoken 
vilification of homosexuals, which are the stuff of legend, exploited the 
fearful insecurities of a nation in collapse. 
</P>
<P>
These oppressive values were pictured in Benton's raucous paintings of everyday 
American life. They're not so different from the values that opponents use 
against Mapplethorpe's work today. How this turnabout occurred is dramatized in 
the aesthetic shift from Pollock to Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's most famous and significant pupil, and the artist who, more than any 
other, became a postwar symbol of American supremacy in the visual arts, is the 
subject of "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga," an exceptional new biography by 
Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The famous abstract drip-paintings that Pollock eventually made were radically 
different from Benton's cartoonish images, which typically focused on the "men 
of action" who, in his parochial view, had been primarily responsible for 
building the nation. But Pollock's idealized relationship with his teacher was 
crucial. Benton's exaggerated masculinity, along with his artistic aspirations, 
brought together personality traits divided between Pollock's own father and 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
The severe repressiveness of the American artistic milieu of the period is 
important to understand. The authors recount a typical event. It turns on the 
marginal place of art in traditional American life. 
</P>
<P>
On a summer day in the early 1950s, Pollock was relaxing at the beach near East 
Hampton, Long Island, with fellow painters Franz Kline and Syd Solomon. "We 
were bemoaning the lack of interest in art among most Americans," Solomon told 
the authors. Someone joked that, if all else failed, they could "just chuck it 
all and go teach old ladies to do watercolors." 
</P>
<P>
Like others of their generation, these artists knew full well that most 
Americans regarded art as frivolous and unmanly -- as old ladies' business. 
"They had inherited an aesthetic world shaped by Victorian sentiment," Naifeh 
and Smith write, "and administered, almost exclusively, by women. Men who 
strayed into that world were considered, at best, unproductive, at worst, 
homosexual, by those outside it." 
</P>
<P>
From Benton on, aggressively macho posing functioned as a compensatory cover 
for male artists. So did the general expulsion of women -- except for 
reputation-saving wives and girlfriends -- from among the ranks of acceptable 
painters and sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
And so did the rhetoric describing works of art such as Pollock's energetic 
drip-paintings, rhetoric that was a paean to their muscularity, force, action 
and power. These were precisely the artistic attributes that Benton, too, had 
championed, albeit in figurative rather than abstract terms. 
</P>
<P>
Laboring under Benton's domineering parental shadow, Pollock's painfully 
conflicted psyche was surely impacted by the likelihood of several youthful 
homosexual experiences, persuasively documented by Naifeh and Smith. Isolating 
specific psychological traits as the fuel for an artist's particular forms can 
be risky. But there can be no doubt that, in his art, Pollock vigorously 
attempted to free himself from 
</P>
<P>
the constricting aesthetic bonds of the day. Riddled with the nervous energy of 
anxiety and alienation, his paintings escaped the one-dimensionality of his 
teacher's art. 
</P>
<P>
This struggle with restrictiveness and suffocating convention, a struggle 
embodied in Abstract Expressionist art, was the burden of history in the years 
that established the United States as global leader. And it was the very burden 
Andy Warhol began to shake off, with startling paintings that mocked the 
vaunted rhetoric of Abstract Expressionist painting. 
</P>
<P>
The marvelous show of early graphic work by the late Warhol, seen this winter 
at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, focused on his award-winning commercial art 
of the 1950s. It laid the groundwork for the great Pop paintings of the 1960s, 
and its backdrop was the era marked by the stratospheric rise of Jackson 
Pollock's reputation. (The brawling, hard-drinking, self-styled cowboy died in 
a gruesome car crash in 1956, at age 44.) The show made plain how Warhol, an 
effeminate homosexual artist who was denied entry into the bullish, macho realm 
of New York School artists, brilliantly managed to subvert the discriminatory 
milieu and usurp center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Although celebrated and successful within the world of commercial art, which 
the Abstract Expressionist vanguard demeaned as low-culture kitsch, Warhol was 
no stranger to the deprivations of second-class status. Homely, gay, raised in 
a poor working-class family in Pittsburgh, he had scant reason to embrace 
Abstract Expressionist cliches of existential freedom. 
</P>
<P>
So, about 1960 Warhol began to employ the devices of advertising and mass media 
to represent those cliches, themselves noteworthy products of the American 
saga. Actual cartoons of men of action -- Dick Tracy, Superman, Popeye -- 
recalled Benton's cartoonish style of representation, but honestly and without 
Michelangelo-esque pretension. 
</P>
<P>
As eloquent assertions of personal liberty, Warhol's disarming Pop paintings 
galvanized attention. The new American world of "high art" may have been 
exalted in the 1950s, but its celebration of ideal freedom had clashed with the 
vulgar reality of its exclusionary social milieu. Suddenly, the mantle of 
all-American original was his. 
</P>
<P>
Many contemporaries were quick to dismiss Pop as mere surface glitz, but 
subsequent generations of artists grasped its deeper meaning. For photography, 
the young Robert Mapplethorpe was among them. His pictures managed a feat 
clearly derived from Warhol's own. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1920s, the camera-work most celebrated in America had been an 
aesthetic sometimes called the new realism but more widely was known as 
straight photography. A crisp, precise, unmanipulated style of picture-making 
had been established as indispensable by Edward Weston, Paul Strand, Imogen 
Cunningham and others. Mapplethorpe mastered the style and echoed his 
predecessors' work in exquisite floral close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
He also turned their new realism toward an even newer reality. The triple focus 
of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s -- blacks, women and homosexual men 
-- are the principal subjects of Mapplethorpe's photographic portraits. 
</P>
<P>
How did the artist portray these marginalized people? His blacks are almost 
always prodigiously virile, and they sometimes are paired with white women. 
Typically, his women are strong and powerful. His homosexual men flaunt 
themselves, sometimes enacting their social bondage in sadomasochistic garb. 
</P>
<P>
If these compositional choices sound stereotypical, or cliched, that's because 
they are. Mapplethorpe used straight photography the way Warhol used mass 
media. He pictured, with clarity, oppressive stereotypes created by the 
dominant, or "straight," society. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most irrational and outrageous of those stereotypes is pictured in 
his now infamous self-portrait with a bull whip that protrudes, tail-like, from 
his rectum. A target of hysterical disdain in the current NEA controversy, this 
picture is indeed ghoulish. But the image has special meaning for the 
censorship drama that has been unfolding for the last year, a meaning that so 
far has been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Uncannily, the photograph conjures the vile and demeaning slur faggot. The 
origin of the slur is the French word for a bundle of sticks, or fagot, piled 
as fuel at the base of the stake when "devil-possessed" heretics were burned by 
religious clerics in medieval Europe. The photographic image assembles familiar 
motifs -- eyes glaring, smile leering, goatee pointed and punishing "tail" 
unfurling -- to create a picture of the devil incarnate. The stereotype 
pictured by Mapplethorpe's self-portrait is that homosexuals are cursed by 
Satan. 
</P>
<P>
Cruel irony therefore surrounds the use of that photograph today in 
condemnations of the National Endowment for the Arts. The explicitly political 
drama of the Mapplethorpe affair has been generated by the religious right, by 
way of a direct mail campaign to Congress and clergy, led by a Methodist 
minister from Tupelo, Miss.; a bully pulpit exploited by a U.S. senator who has 
long been chief Washington nemesis of gay men and women; and a fundamentalist 
cable television network, which has repeatedly broadcast evangelical opinion on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the assault is unsurprising. The evangelical right, which rode 
higher during the early period of the Reagan era than it ever has before, has 
suffered a precipitous decline in political power in the last few years as sex 
scandals wracked its hierarchies. To repair an image ruined by hypocrisy, a 
"moral war" was needed to fight -- and win. 
</P>
<P>
The reliable bugaboo of "godless homosexuality" made a useful battleground, 
especially as the equally tried-and-true bogeyman of "godless communism" had 
evaporated. When the Rev. Pat Robertson rails against the NEA for supporting 
Mapplethorpe he can appear to be diligently casting out the same sins that 
disgraced Jim Bakker, his felonious predecessor. Sacrilege, or the intentional 
desecration of a sacred idea, was candidly alleged in the attack on Andres 
Serrano's photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in urine, but it applies 
as well to a pious rejection of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe's photograph gave shocking visual form to the demonized image 
fabricated for homosexuals by an oppressive society. Medieval Europe is long 
gone, but the continuing relevance of this insightful work of art is succinctly 
demonstrated by an April 19 editorial in the Arizona Republic. Dennis Barrie, 
director of Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center, was indicted in April on 
charges of obscenity for showing Mapplethorpe's photographs at his museum. The 
editorial speaks to the charge of using minors in pornography, a charge which 
arose from separate photographs of a naked boy and a partially clad girl. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath a biblical quotation from II Corinthians -- "Where the spirit of the 
Lord is, there is liberty" -- the artist is rhetorically burned at the stake 
for the crime of pedophilia. "Mr. Barrie may think that putting kiddie porn on 
display is a matter of artistic integrity," the editorial concludes, "but the 
truth refuses to go away; and the truth is that Mr. Mapplethorpe, a man of 
undeniable skill, exploited small children, for which he conceivably might have 
been prosecuted had he not died of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to say whether the editorialist's "truth" would also condemn 
Edward Weston to the flames -- or Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, 
Harry Callahan, Jan Saudek, Minor White or any other great artist who has 
photographed undraped children. But Mapplethorpe is distinct from most in the 
history of photographers: An open homosexual, he can be tarred with the 
scariest lie of all, which falsely claims gay men as inveterate child 
molesters. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial's final, gratuitous reference to AIDS is telling. From the start, 
this medical condition has been superstitiously portrayed by the evangelical 
right as divine retribution for unspeakable sins. Its invocation is wholly 
superfluous to the editorial -- try reading the sentence without the last two 
words -- but its inclusion subtly reinforces the prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
As the Great Depression did for Benton, the well-documented panic over AIDS is 
what has created fertile ground for today's exploitation of deeply entrenched 
homophobia in the United States.

<P>
A controversy over art that, in the all too recent past, dared not speak its 
name, puts freedom of expression squarely on the line. In the Cincinnati courts 
and in the halls of Congress, a longstanding American drama of personal liberty 
continues to be played out.

JASPER JOHNS' 'MAP' PLEDGED TO MOCA; 
</P>
<P>
ART: OWNER HOPES HER DECISION WILL INSPIRE OTHER COLLECTORS TO DONATE MAJOR 
WORKS.

Heralding the holiday season and looking forward to a new year when income tax 
laws will once again encourage donations of artworks to museums, the Los 
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art has announced a major addition to its 
collection. "Map," a seminal painting by Jasper Johns, is a gift of Marcia 
Weisman, a founding director of the museum and a long-time art collector. 
</P>
<P>
By donating the painting that is generally regarded as the most important piece 
in her collection, Marcia Weisman said she hoped to inspire others to give the 
best of their collections to museums that will use the art and share it with 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the motivations for giving this is to encourage people to go to MOCA 
and see this wonderful painting among all the other good things at the museum. 
You can't appreciate art unless you see the real thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Map" will go on view on Jan. 20 and again on April 7 in two exhibitions from 
the museum's permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Richard Koshalek said the gift of this "genuine masterpiece" is 
a "symbolic" act that bodes well for 1991, when donors will be able to deduct 
the full appreciated value of artworks donated to museums. The tax law change 
was enacted for one year only, but arts supporters are hoping to extend the 
provision, which was in effect until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Map," a trademark Johns done in 1962, depicts a map of the continental United 
States with the states' names in stenciled letters. Despite its mundane subject 
matter, the 60x93-inch work is a very "painterly" painting, awash in slashing 
brush strokes and drips of pigment. Executed in encaustic and collage on 
canvas, it is predominantly blue-gray with rich passages of reds and yellows. 
</P>
<P>
The work is typical of Johns' revolutionary use of familiar, flat objects, such 
as targets and flags, which challenged the Abstract Expressionists' emotional 
approach and ushered in the Pop age. "Map," in particular, combines 
Expressionistic painting with a new interest in popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
At MOCA, the painting provides a link between works by Jackson Pollock -- 
donated by the Taft and Rita Schreiber estate and by Philip and Beatrice Gersh 
-- and later works in the collection, Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman has been wooed by several museums, but she decided to give the Johns to 
MOCA "because everything goes to the East. The map is coast-to-coast and art 
should be that way too," she said, noting that her gift coincides with the 10th 
anniversary of Koshalek's tenure at MOCA. 
</P>
<P>
Her donation is a "partial gift," with an as yet undesignated percentage of 
ownership and possession going to the museum this year and additional portions 
ceded over time until the museum has sole ownership and possession. This 
legally binding practice has become increasingly popular in recent years as a 
means of allowing collectors to keep their donated works part of the time and 
to spread tax deductions over an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
The museum declined to put a dollar value on the gift, but major works by Johns 
-- whom many critics regard as America's most important living artist -- have 
routinely sold for more than $1 million at auction. Johns made front page news 
in 1988 when his painting "White Flag" was sold for $7 million one night at 
Christie's New York and another painting, "False Start," brought $17 million 
the following evening at Sotheby's. Art prices have subsequently fallen as 
speculators have withdrawn from the market, but Johns' work has suffered no 
loss of status in the art world.

AMBITIOUS EXHIBITS DEMONSTRATE MOCA SPREADS ITSELF TOO THIN

The Museum of Contemporary Art presents a pair of exhibitions that try to do 
too many things at once. The smaller -- and by far the more interesting -- is 
"Selections from the Beatrice and Philip Gersh Collection." The big one is a 
sprawling and only occasionally coherent shuffling of some 150 works from the 
permanent collection called "Constructing a History." It would be more aptly 
titled "Deconstructing History." 
</P>
<P>
Both shows are housed in MOCA's California Plaza headquarters on Bunker Hill. 
They derive graceful authority from architect Arta Isozaki's galleries and a 
crisply professional installation. If the cosmetics are a hit, the content is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Gersh material stands up nicely. The couple are veteran Los Angeles art 
patrons who have collected for some 30 years. She is a MOCA trustee and both 
have been active at the old Pasadena Art Museum and the County Museum of Art. 
They have donated and promised works to MOCA including a small Jackson Pollock 
and Susan Rothenberg's spooky "Black Dress." 
</P>
<P>
Their collection skips through the history of modern art from a small 1912 
Kandinsky to Ed Rusha's recent "Picture H House" which represents his welcome 
return to the use of images after a long siege of pure wordworks. The 45 
examples (on view through March 11) admirably combine objects of unpretentious 
domestic scale with a keen eye for excellence. Aside from a slightly 
indifferent Frank Stella -- "The Whiteness of the Whale" -- virtually 
everything is of museum quality. They also reveal a knack that museums often 
funk in their quest for boffo impressiveness by the yard. The Gershes know how 
to distill. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking quality here is in the number of works so small as to 
approach miniature scale while capturing the essence of the artist. Francis 
Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" packs all his essential Pinteresque 
vision of everyday horror into a canvas about one foot square. From 1963 -- the 
period before Bacon started doing impersonations of himself -- it compresses 
his talent for painting a face that vacillates between old-master solidity and 
the scattered terror of a mind coming unglued. 
</P>
<P>
The Gersh nose for condensation sniffs out the right stuff in everything from 
Giacometti's poignantly dignified 23-inch "Bust of a Man" through de Kooning's 
1949 pastel "Two Women" and on to Joel Shapiro's foot-tall bronze block-man. It 
expands the surrounding gallery space into an immense hall where a cabinet-size 
painting looks like a vast billboard. A very amusing and unusually good work by 
Jenny Holzer sits nearby. It is a marble bench carved with ironic modern 
truisms like "Government is a Burden on the People." Near the Shapiro it 
becomes a marble temple. 
</P>
<P>
It's a nourishing aesthetic experience only diluted by a barely disguised sense 
of lurking mixed-motive. The Gersh collection is virtually enveloped by the art 
from the permanent collection -- as if the museum can hardly wait to get its 
hands on them. One can hardly blame the desire, but the symbolism of the 
installation and the courtliness of the catalogue foreword sets one worrying 
about matters unwelcome in the midst of an artistic experience -- of the 
shrinking numbers of serious collectors and the vanishing breed of truly 
philanthropic donors to public museums. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is "Constructing a History" (to March 4). The general idea seems to 
have been to put works in unusual juxtaposition so as to trigger unexpected 
insights. The first space contains artworks by such disparate contemporaries as 
Allen Ruppersberg, Julian Schnabel and Louise Lawler. The only insight to be 
gained from the combo is that there sure is a lot of different stuff going on. 
But we already knew that. 
</P>
<P>
In the second gallery it appears that the idea was to put the art in roughly 
chronological order, demonstrating the way MOCA's permanent collection is 
slowly growing to be able to track the development of contemporary art. Here we 
find classics by the likes of Miro, Gorky and Pollock followed by a room of 
Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko and Lee Krasner leading to another 
space full of minimalists. 
</P>
<P>
Here we see the likes of Morris Louis and Jules Olitski. The odd man out is Ron 
Davis represented by one of his back-painted geometric-illusion panels. 
Presumably this was the work that was supposed to kick open the doors of 
perception. All it does is cause us to remember that not every Davis is a 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
A room of California light-and-space types such as Larry Bell, Robert Irwin and 
Mary Corse is invaded by such contextual anomalies as Agnes Martin and Sherrie 
Levine. The net effect is to remind us that when you combine such delicately 
nuanced art it loses its subtle resonances and just looks thin, thin, thin. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation carries on like this for some 15 tedious galleries. 
Occasionally it works, as when Vito Acconci's cinder-block construction about 
social repression is joined by Larry Clark's suite of drug-culture photos, 
"Tulsa." We certainly knew that both artists have a subversive, outlaw quality 
so it's not the information that's important, it's the poetry of the 
combination. They rhyme, these guys. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hasty quality to the exhibition as if -- unable to decide on theme 
-- assistant curator Ann Goldstein just tried to present several at once. The 
result is a patchwork of art trying to prove similarities where none exist and 
papering over significant differences. But the main shortcoming here is trying 
to do a visual version of a college-exam compare-and-contrast essay question 
with works of radically different quality. 
</P>
<P>
Fine things show up by the likes of Anselm Keifer, Jill Geigerich and Alexis 
Smith, but there is too much fudging about probing the significance of art 
whose main significance is that it's second-string work. Revelatory combination 
is an important staple of curatorship but it only works to advantage when the 
art is all about equally super. New York's Museum of Modern Art permanent 
collection is smartly placed, but this is possible because the works are all 
masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
"Constructing a History" seems to have been infected by MOCA's ever-clearer 
leanings to spreading itself too thin. It lives under a veneer of activities 
all of which are good in themselves. Good community relations are good, as are 
good international relations. Good publicity is good. Design shows are good as 
architecture, performance and radio broadcasts are good. 
</P>
<P>
But a place that calls itself an art museum is by definition about a solid and 
undistracted striving for excellence. As we move into the '90s, let's hope this 
admirable young institution sets its priorities and pursues them with the 
tenacity of a mountain climber.

<TEXT>
   The National Gallery of Art will celebrate the
10th anniversary of its modernistic East Building with a two-year
exhibition of its small but rapidly growing collection of 20th
century art, gallery officials said Tuesday.
   The show, which will open Dec. 4, will include about 250 works by
modern artists ranging from Pablo Picasso to Andy Warhol. It will
occupy more than half of the building's 55,000 square feet of
gallery space on three of its five levels.
   ``The new exhibition will demonstrate our progress in expanding
the gallery's collection of modern art,'' said director J. Carter
Brown.
   About 60 percent of the paintings, sculptures and drawings in the
show will come from the gallery's permanent collection. Half of
those were acquired in the decade since the East Building opened on
June 1, 1978. The remaining works will be on loan from private
collections.
   Curator Jack Cowart said that although the East Building was
designed in part by architect I.M. Pei specifically to house the
gallery's modern art collection, the only permanent exhibition site
for those works has been on the less visible concourse or basement
level of the building.
   Cowart said 20th century art was virtually non-existent at the
National Gallery until the early 1960s, when the gallery received a
gift of about 100 works of modern art from the Chester Dale
collection.
   Since then, he said, the gallery's collection has grown steadily
with the goal of assembling a high-quality range of modern masters,
although there is no pretense of matching the vast numbers of New
York's Museum of Modern Art or Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   ``We acquire carefully, slowly and with great care,'' said
Cowart, who estimated that about 90 percent of the gallery's
acquisitions are gifts rather than purchases.
   Two major gifts were made in 1986, when the gallery acquired more
than 900 drawings and 100 paintings by American artist Mark Rothko
and ``The Stations of the Cross,'' a 15-painting series by Barnett
Newman.
   The gallery's modern paintings, sculptures and decorative art
objects have grown in the past decade from 272 to 613 works,
compared with thousands in other collections. ``Our center of
gravity is the old masters,'' Brown conceded.
   The exhibition opening in December, involving extensive
remodeling of the East Building's gallery spaces, will move 20th
century art upstairs from the basement ``to give the collection a
presence the public can count on,'' Cowart said.
   The tower and upper levels will feature pre-World War II artists
such as Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and Amedeo
Modigliani. The concourse galleries will highlight the works of
postwar artists such as Warhol, Newman, Jackson Pollock, Roy
Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns.
   Brown said the exhibition may embark on a national tour once it
closes at the East Building in December 1990.

   An exhibition of modern art from
the New York and Venice Guggenheim collections drew 121,000 visitors
during its display at Prague's National Gallery, officials said.
   On Sunday, the last day of the exhibit, it took visitors 1{ hours
to make it through the line to the second floor of Sternberk Palace,
where 50 paintings by 33 artists have hung since early November.
   The Guggenheim exhibit brought to Prague expressionist, cubist,
futurist, constructivist and surrealist masterpieces.
   It was preceded last summer by a Czech National Gallery exhibit
of 60 canvases in New York's Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art.
   On display in Prague were paintings by artists such as Pablo
Picasso, Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, Joan Miro, Jackson
Pollock and Jean Dubuffet.
   The two shows were based on a 1986 cultural agreement and a
10-year friendship between Guggenheim director Thomas M. Messer and
Jiri Kotalik, the director of the Prague gallery.
   ``It's a sign of improving relations. It could not have happened
five years ago,'' said Messer, adding he saw the exhibit ``not
merely as an art show but as a very significant cultural event.''
   ``It's the first time ever that a full survey of 20th century
paintings ... has been presented in any of the socialist
countries,'' he said in an interview.
   He noted, however, that the show focused on the period 1900-45,
and that a second exhibit would be needed to show contemporary art.
   This thought was echoed also in some of the entries in the
visitors' book and complaints that the works on show were already
well-known from literature.
   Most, however, were grateful. ``Thank you, we ourselves are not
likely to get to New York,'' wrote one visitor. Another said,
``thanks, but wish there had been more.''
   There were so many visitors, up to 4,200 a day, that after a few
days the gallery announced it was extending viewing time until 8
p.m. two days a week.
   ``Artwork necessarily creates an atmosphere of international
understanding,'' wrote the trade union daily newspaper Prace. ``Art
can speak with the same urgency to people throughout the world.''
   The women's weekly Vlasta said, ``We can only wish that the
useful international cooperation continues. After all, it brings
enrichment for both countries _ for us, especially, an expansion of
knowledge of the various trends of contemporary 20th century art.''

   A premier contemporary art collection,
largely out of public view since twice being attacked by vandals
five years ago, is back on display in a new, more secure location.
   ``It's just great to see people looking at them again,'' said
Dennis Anderson, curator of the Empire State Plaza art collection.
   The two dozen paintings used to hang in the busy main walkway of
the plaza, a huge state office complex adjacent to the state
Capitol. Their new home is in an underground lobby of the Health
Department's headquarters. More than a dozen sculptures in the
plaza art collection are going on display in another lobby area of
the same building.
   Officials say the lobbies will be locked from dusk till dawn and
are easier for police to monitor than the quarter-mile-long main
concourse, where the artworks were previously.
   The collection includes works by Franz Kline, Helen
Frankenthaler, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, Adolf Gottlieb and
other mainstays of the New York School of abstract expressionist
painting. Five sculptures by David Smith that have been outside on
the plaza for two decades have been moved inside.
   A 1952 painting by Jackson Pollock, titled ``No. 12,'' joins the
collection for the first time. It was damaged in a 1962 fire at the
governor's mansion and had hung for years, its paint blistered and
peeling, in the office of the manager of the office complex.
   The Pollock work and the 20 damaged by vandals were
paintstakingly restored at the Williamstown Regional Art
Conservation Laboratory in Williamstown, Mass.
   Anderson declined to put a value on the collection. But in 1987,
the chairman of the commission that oversees the art, Barnabus
McHenry, estimated its worth at more than $20 million.
   The works were purchased by New York state for about $2.5
million between 1966 and 1973. The pieces were selected by then
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and other experts to adorn the
granite-lined walkways and modernistic, cavernous courtyards of
Rockefeller's grandiose office complex.
   Keeping art safe from vandals and thieves is a worry for
curators everywhere.
   ``There has been a rash of stolen works of art and of
vandalism,'' said Mimi Gaudieri, executive director of the
Association of Art Museum Directors in New York City. ``I think all
museums in the country have improved their security measures.
They've hired more guards and put in better electronic equipment.''
   In the most recent major instance of vandalism, two people
shouting anti-imperialist slogans mutilated paintings by Roy
Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist at the International Contemporary
Art Fair in Paris on Oct. 27. The works had an estimated value of
$1.35 million. A small painting by Philippe Favier was stolen from
the same exhibit.
   Anderson and other experts said artwork available for public
viewing is at risk of being damaged or pilfered, whether the works
are on display in government buildings, corporate headquarters or
private museums.
   ``Security breaches happen in museums and they certainly have
guards in nearly every room,'' Anderson said. ``Short of locking
them (artworks) away from the public, which would be the ultimate
kind of security, we have to deal in stages or variables of
security.''
   Thomas Tubbs, a spokesman for the state Office of General
Services, estimates more than 1 mllion people, including the
15,000 state employees who work in the complex, see the plaza
artwork each year.
   But workers and tourists are not the only ones who gravitate to
the plaza.
   Until authorities cracked down a few years ago, dozens of
homeless people congregated nightly in the parking garages and
maintenance areas beneath the plaza or on the complex's concourse
level, especially during the winter.
   In 1985, a mentally disturbed man who believed he was getting
orders from outer space scribbled messages in French and English on
a dozen plaza paintings. A few months later, another disturbed man
slashed and wrote religious slogans with a felt-tip marker on eight
more pieces of art.
   Of the pieces not damaged by vandals, many displayed the bruises
of being displayed in a public building, conservators say. The
artwork was a frequent target of school children's spitballs. Hand
prints and shoe marks had to periodically be cleaned off the few
wall-size pieces in the collection.
   In 1987, a $10,000 tapestry disappeared without a trace from a
plaza wall. It has never been recovered.
   In its new location, the artwork is surrounded by electronic
sensors and wire railings extending four feet from the walls. If a
person's arm or foot approaches a canvas, an alarm will sound.
Cameras will allow police to watch those watching the art.
   The pieces that were made for specific sites on the concourse,
measuring 50 feet or more long, will remain there, with electronic
sensors and camera surveillance for protection.

<TEXT>
   Sidney Janis, the art gallery owner whose
ability to spot trends helped popularize such movements as Abstract
Expressionism and Pop Art, has died. He was 93.
   Janis died Thursday of pneumonia.
   A onetime vaudeville dancer, Janis began going to art galleries
for fun while working for his brother's chain of shoe stores. He
later became a successful shirt manufacturer and did not open his
own gallery until 1948 at age 52.
   Janis mounted major shows of European masters and had the knack
of promoting already established artists so well his gallery was
known for setting the tone in the art world in the 1950s and '60s.
   His early shows were the first American presentations of Jean
Arp, Robert Delaunay and Joaquin Torres-Garcia. In 1951, he had the
first comprehensive show of Henri Rousseau, and two years later,
Marcel Duchamp mounted a Dada show at his gallery.
   In 1950, he put together works of the Abstract Expressionism
artists Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Jackson
Pollock and Mark Rothko.
   In 1961, he mounted ``The New Realists,'' ushering in Pop Art.
Artists who showed with Janis included Claes Oldenburg, George
Segal, Jim Dine and Tom Wesselmann.
   Janis began buying art from School of Paris artists during his
visits to Europe in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He also
traveled throughout the United States during the Depression in
search of primitive artists. Among those he found were a West
Virginia steelworker, Patrick J. Sullivan, and a retired Brooklyn
slipper manufacturer, Morris Hirshfield.
   In 1967, he gave his private collection of 103 works to the
Museum of Modern Art. Valued at $2 million at the time, the
collection of paintings by Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Paul Klee,
Umberto Boccioni and others would now be worth more than $100
million.
   Janis also wrote two books with his wife on Surrealism and
Picasso.
   He was active in the Sidney Janis Gallery until his 90th
birthday. His sons Carroll and Conrad and a grandson run the
gallery today.
   Janis' wife, Harriet, died in 1963. In addition to his sons, he
is survived by a daughter, Robin, all of New York City. A sister,
Carolyn Raport, lives in Los Angeles.
   A funeral was scheduled Sunday at Riverside Memorial Chapel.

   Thanks partly to Ikkan Sanada, Black Monday has failed to make the art market blue. 
The droves of eager Japanese collectors and dealers who the New York-based consultant shepherded to major auctions in the past two weeks have helped keep the bidding lively. 

   The sale of Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" at Sotheby's Wednesday night for $53.9 million -- the highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction -- was global news. 
But it gives a misleading impression of the postcrash state of the art market. 
Dealers and collectors who sat through auctions the past two weeks, the heart of the fall auction season in New York, saw a market that was strong but far less euphoric than it was last May. 
About 25% of the expensive works offered here recently didn't sell, even though those that did brought prices so high that total sales set records. 

   But a big factor buoying the art market was the heaviest buying ever by Japanese. 
And on the Japanese scene, Mr. Sanada is one of the more visible and important players. 
One of the few Japanese consultants who understand Western art as thoroughly as Japanese culture, Mr. Sanada has helped educate buyers who had known next to nothing of auctions. 

   Two weeks ago, Mr. Sanada sat through contemporary art sales flanked by about 18 "beginner collectors" from the Keiyu Forum, an association of young Japanese entrepreneurs, helping them buy works by Jackson Pollock and others. 
Last week at the impressionist auctions, he accompanied his client Kazuo Fujii, president of the Fujii Gallery of Tokyo, who would occasionally pop up to snap flash photos of the proceedings in between buying multimillion-dollar paintings. 

   The Japanese have bid at auction here for years, but their presence this year was the strongest ever, fueled by the robust yen and aggressive marketing and education campaigns by the auction houses, Christie's International PLC and Sotheby's Holdings Inc. Last May, the Japanese walked away with about 30% of the major impressionist artworks sold at Christie's and Sotheby's. 
The previous record artwork, a $39.9 million van Gogh sold at Christie's in London last March, was bought by Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. of Tokyo. 

   At Christie's big evening sale of impressionist and modern art last week, Japanese buyers swept up 48% (by dollar value) of the art for sale. 
They bought five of the 10 most-expensive works. 
"This is the biggest attendance by Japanese I ever saw, no doubt about it," says Mr. Sanada. 
"There are plenty of new faces." 

   The son of an art-loving journalist, Mr. Sanada left college at age 19 to move to Paris, where he worked for six years in a Japanese-owned art gallery that sent French impressionist art to Japan. 
"Since I was too skinny to carry things, they asked me to learn French and Japanese accounting and export laws," he says. 
He briefly returned to Tokyo, but he found his age to be a barrier. 
"A 27-year-old art dealer is a joke in Japan," he says. 
"You have to respect the old guy." 

   So he moved to New York, where he studied English and art history. 
In 1982, he set himself up as a "runner," finding art for Japanese art dealers. 

   Now, he works out of his home in White Plains, N.Y., offering intensive personal services for a nucleus of 10 big clients, mostly dealers. 
For Mr. Fujii, for example, who speaks no English, Mr. Sanada acts as tour guide and translator as well as adviser, accompanying him to every auction and dealer he wants to visit when he comes to New York twice a year. 

   "In times of auction season, some ask me which paintings or prints they should go for and what is a reasonable limit," says Mr. Sanada, a slight, bespectacled man whose boyish face makes him look much younger than 37. 

   Mr. Sanada gets kudos from New York dealers. 
"The other Japanese advisers I have dealt with don't know as much about art," says one SoHo art dealer. 
"They come in with a list that someone else has made and they will only pay attention to that list. 
If you veer from the list slightly and say, 'This is a better painting or more interesting drawing,' it is clear they are in unfamiliar territory." 

   There are far more Japanese art buyers armed with the knowledge and interest to buy at American auctions, and experts predict that they'll be around even if the yen should drop a bit. 
But Mr. Sanada isn't satisfied merely with more Japanese buying. 
He wants to change the taste of Japanese buyers who know only French Impressionism, and inspire them to buy more contemporary American art. 

   Mr. Sanada did score a major triumph last May, persuading a Japanese businessman who had never heard of artist Willem de Kooning to buy a major painting at an auction three days after he arrived from Tokyo. 
"I took him to the Museum of Modern Art and lectured him," says Mr. Sanada. 
"I told him that it was too late to start a museum-quality collection of French impressionists, but not for American contemporary art. 
And besides, he wouldn't be competing against other Japanese." 
At an auction at Sotheby's, the businessman bid for a de Kooning, and let out a whoop as his bid won at $2.5 million.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Big names fail to find buyers: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GREAT names of British art are having a difficult time in the auction
rooms this week. On Wednesday Constable's 'Harnham Bridge', estimated at
Pounds 1m plus, failed to sell at Sotheby's. Yesterday an important Turner
watercolour of Venice was unsold in the same saleroom when the bidding
stopped at Pounds 400,000.
It set a record in 1988 for an English watercolour of Pounds 440,000. Its
European owner wanted Pounds 500,000 this time. The sale of British drawings
and water colours totalled Pounds 706,596 and was 55.2 per cent unsold.
Another important Turner, 'The Wreck', was a casualty, but Agnews paid
Pounds 187,000 for a view of Lichfield Cathedral that Turner executed about
1835. A wooded landscape by Gainsborough sold, below estimate, at Pounds
88,000.
Christie's sale of contemporary art in New York on Wednesday was dented by
the failure of two top lots, paintings by de Kooning and Rauschenberg, to
find buyers. That accounted for much of the 30 per cent unsold out of a
total of Dollars 17.76m (Pounds 11.6m).
Other important pictures sold below estimate, in particular '0 Through 9' by
Jasper Johns, which made Dollars 2.3m as against its Dollars 2.8m-Dollars
3.5m estimate, and 'No 6: 1948' by Jackson Pollock, which went for Dollars
1.98m (estimate Dollars 2.5m-Dollars 3.5m). There was one artist record, for
Joseph Beuys: Dollars 385,000 was paid for a cello which he had covered with
grey felt and decorated with a red cross.
There were also setbacks at Christie's English furniture auction in London
yesterday. The two star items, a commode and a pair of secretaire bookcases,
all decoratively painted and attributed to George Brookshaw, failed to sell,
in spite of Pounds 200,000 bid for the bookcases. A George IV ormolu mounted
centrepiece, depicting the king as a Roman emperor, more than doubled its
estimate at Pounds 121,000.
In Geneva Sotheby's sold for Pounds 2.05m the fourth-largest emerald cut
diamond to appear at auction, weighing 50.83 carats. It was bought by a
Saudi sheikh, Ahmed Fitaihi. In London a nine-volume set of Blaeu's 'Atlas
major', in Dutch, and in a contemporary 17th-century cabinet, beat its
estimate at Pounds 187,000.

<TEXT>
   Of all the feats in the Guinness Book of World Records, being
the ``Oldest Living Person'' is perhaps the most tantalizing and
the most open to dispute.
   Everyone, after all, is a potential contestant.
   And nearly everyone, at some point, has yearned for the honor.
   ``No single subject is more obscured by vanity, deceit,
falsehood and deliberate fraud than the extremes of human
longevity,'' the Guinness editors assert, noting hundreds of claims
of people over 100 and some, ``insulting to the intelligence,'' of
people living into their third centuries.
   Yet few claims are harder to prove than extreme longevity _
after all, no one else who's alive today was alive when the oldest
old were born.
   That is true of Carrie White of Palatka, Fla., and Jackson
Pollock of Milledgeville, Ga. The 1990 Guinness Book recognizes
Miss White as the oldest, at 115. But since that book went to
press, Pollock has emerged with the claim that he is 123. Guinness
is still awaiting proof.
   The ages of these living ancients raise interesting questions.
   How do we know they're the oldest? Do they give us the hope of
immortality? A window into our past? Or are they like circus
freaks, fascinating only because they are so different, so extreme?
   Aside from the question of proof, longevity experts say the
answers are all ``Yes.'' Mainly, people like the idea of someone
cheating death.
   ``Nobody wants to stare at death. It's one way to confront death
_ to consider not confronting it,'' said Dr. Richard Sprott,
associate director for biomedical research and clinical medicine at
the National Institute on Aging.
   In Carrie White's case, there is fairly persuasive evidence she
is 115; the search for Pollock's past is fascinating but as yet
inconclusive.
   Miss White lives at the Putnam Memorial Nursing Home, where she
likes to attend church and song sessions. She is in good health,
though she doesn't seem to understand the fuss over her age and
refuses to talk about her past.
   Hers is not a happy story, from what little is known. She is
said to have been born Nov. 18, 1874, in Gadsden County, Fla. As a
young woman, she married John White, who was either a blacksmith or
a farmer, and on the day after her 35th birthday, in 1909, he
committed her to the Florida State Hospital for the mentally ill at
Chattahoochee. Her diagnosis was ``post-typhoid psychosis,'' and
she remained there until she was, according to her records, 110.
   Miss White's claim to longevity rests mainly on her medical
records, which are unusual since they span so much of her life. The
only possibility for fraud would be if she or her husband had lied
about her age when she was committed _ a possibility, certainly,
but one Guinness considers unlikely.
   There is no similar documentation for Jackson Pollock's life.
Pollock, a tall, gangly man with a taste for Prince Albert tobacco
and soul food, says he was born Christmas Day 1866, served in the
Spanish-American War and World War I and loaded mail and checked
railroad baggage in Cleveland and New York.
   He has lived in the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville
since 1972.
   Alyce Friend, of the Georgia Office of Aging, has been preparing
a report for Guinness. She has found tantalizing tidbits, but no
proof.
   The strongest documentation is Pollock's 1966 Social Security
application, which lists his birthdate Dec. 25, 1869 _ which would
make him three years younger than his hospital records but still
the world's oldest person.
   But Social Security records can be based largely on the
applicant's word, and are considered unreliable by longevity
experts. So for now, Pollock's claim is based almost solely on his
own account.
   Ms. Friend, for one, believes him, and calls him ``an
inspiration.'' She attributes his longevity to strong genes and
self-satisfaction.
   Guinness, for now, remains doubtful, said Editor Donald McFarlan.
   The book lists Shigechiyo Izumi of Japan as the person who lived
to the oldest age ever documented _ 120 years, 237 days, based on
census records.
   But even that documentation isn't good enough for some
scientists, who say it's just too unlikely that a human being could
live that long.
   ``I don't know a single serious gerontologist in the world who
believes these claims of people who are over 115,'' said Dr.
Leonard Hayflick, professor of anatomy at the University of
California at San Francisco.
   From time to time, claims have surfaced of extraordinary groups
of people who have lived well into their 130s, 140s, 150s and
higher. One such group was said to live in the Caucasus Mountains
of the Soviet Union; another in a remote area of Ecuador. In each
case, experts say, the claims proved to be lies. The motives vary,
but include draft dodging, national pride, tourism and simple
boastfulness.
   Scientists say it again and again: Humans just aren't built to
last that long. And they dismiss the notion that the human lifespan
is getting longer.
   Life expectancy is another matter _ it has risen dramatically
since the turn of the century as nutrition and medical care have
improved. But while more people are getting closer to the maximum
possible lifespan, the span itself is unchanged, Hayflick said.
``As far as we know, the human lifespan ... has not changed in the
past 100,000 years.''
   So we're left with the claims of Carrie White and Jackson
Pollock, and the thought that more people in the future will live
long beyond the biblical span of threescore years and 10 _ which
after all is only 70.
   ``I think there will be a time when 100 years old will be very
common,'' said Dr. Edward Schneider, dean of the Andrus Gerontology
Research Center at the University of Southern California. ``I don't
know about 110, but 100 will be common.''
   Beyond that, gerontologists say, what's the point? We all want
eternal youth, but do we really want eternal age? The very old, the
experts say, are rarely as interested in immortality as are younger
people.
   Florence Knapp of Philadelphia lived to 114 and was, for a time,
considered the world's oldest person.
   ``I think she could never understand why she was allowed to live
so long,'' her niece, Ruth Oberholtzer, said after her death. ``One
time she said that she feels like she might have been bad and this
was God's way of punishing her.''

JANSS' ART CACHE TO GO ON BLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE MAGNATE AMASSED QUALITY, ECLECTIC COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-two contemporary works, including a prime early painting by Francis 
Bacon that is expected to break the British artist's record of $1.76 million, 
will be offered May 2. Four modern works, by Rene Magritte, Jean Delville, 
Giorgio Morandi and James Ensor, will be sold May 9 in a sale of Impressionist 
and modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Though Janss and his family made their fortune in the American tradition of 
developing land -- about 90,000 acres of Southern California property and ski 
resorts at Snowmass in Aspen, Colo., and Sun Valley, Idaho -- Janss is revered 
in the art community as an eccentric, intuitive collector. He jumped to his 
death, at 74, on March 16 in Santa Monica, after suffering a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Enchanted by artists and adventurous dealers, Janss built a consistently 
high-quality, if eclectic, collection from sources all around the world. 
Pre-Columbian art, Mimbres pottery and antique chess sets mingled with 
contemporary masterpieces in his West Los Angeles home. His collecting was an 
intensely personal pursuit, and he never formed strong attachments to museums 
-- nor gave them reason to expect that he might donate his collection to them. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted an auction. He had discussed it for years, and I 
approve of that. He didn't want his collection entombed in some kind of shrine. 
He believed that the works have a life of their own," said Janss' daughter, 
Dagny Janss Corcoran, who owns Art Catalogues, an exhibition catalogue shop in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Art walked into Janss' life in the late '50s, according to Corcoran. "He was 
sitting up there in Thousand Oaks, working with his race horses or whatever he 
was doing at the time, and he just turned left," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the people responsible for his change of direction were artist Sam 
Francis and Walter Hopps, the current director of the Menil Collection in 
Houston, who was a founder of the vanguard Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles and a 
director of the Pasadena Art Museum in the late '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
According to Corcoran, Francis introduced himself after Janss boldly (and 
without much knowledge) stated in an interview that Francis, Mark Rothko and 
Jackson Pollock -- the three contemporary American artists whose work he then 
owned -- were the most important painters in the world. Meeting one artist led 
to another, and Janss found their ideas and life styles completely captivating, 
Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hopps became "a sort of professor" to Janss, opening doors for the 
collector and filling his head with new information but never making decisions 
for him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Janss, of all the major collectors I have known over the past 40 years, was 
unquestionably the most independent," Hopps wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Stories abound from Janss' collecting years. There's the one that New York 
dealer Leo Castelli tells about meeting the unconventional Californian who 
eventually became a good friend. "He walked into my gallery in 1963 from God 
knows where -- looking ragged, as if he were from Texas or the desert -- and 
said he wanted to buy a Rauschenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the end of the show and I told him that only a large one, 'Die Hard,' 
(an early silk-screened painting that is in the auction) was available. He 
said, 'Fine. I'll take that.' When I told him the price was $16,000, he pulled 
a crumpled check out of his pocket and promptly filled it out," Castelli 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The tale of a David Hockney purchase in 1974 is even more picturesque: Janss 
plucked "A Grand Procession of Dignitaries in the Semi-Egyptian Style" from the 
sky. On the way to the Kasmin Gallery in London with Dagny, the collector first 
saw Hockney's 12-foot-long canvas dangling from a crane while it was being 
loaded into an upstairs window of the gallery. Undaunted by his odd viewpoint 
and the painting's plastic wrapping, he immediately decided to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"A Grand Procession," a fantasy painted in 1961, is valued at $750,000 to $1 
million -- well above Hockney's record of $647,680, set in December by "A Neat 
Lawn." Painted while Hockney was a student at the Royal College of Art in 
London, the theatrical parade of strange personages was inspired by Constantine 
Cavafy's 1904 poem, "Waiting for the Barbarians." The painting is among early 
works that caught the attention of Hockney's first dealer, John Kasmin, and is 
considered a seminal work because it foreshadows his later "stage" paintings 
and set designs. 
</P>
<P>
Among other works set to leave the Janss collection and go out into the world 
are Bacon's "Study for a Portrait of Van Gogh II," valued at $2 million to $2.5 
million. "There's no question whatever" that the painting will reach or exceed 
that estimate, according to Lucy Mitchell-Inness, director of Sotheby's 
contemporary art department. 
</P>
<P>
The 1957 oil depicting a desolate artist trudging through a terrifyingly bleak 
landscape is one of six Bacon works inspired by Vincent van Gogh's "The Painter 
on the Road to Tarascon," which was destroyed during World War II. Bacon 
painted the version in the Janss collection after a trip to Tangiers and 
interpreted the theme of artist as haunted outsider in terms of the North 
African sun, using dark shadows and searing color. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Diebenkorn's 1959 oil, "Coffee," may also set a record. The painting of 
a seated woman drinking a cup of coffee is valued at $800,000 to $1 million -- 
close to the record $1.16 million paid last May for "July," a similarly styled 
figurative work done two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Three constructions by Joseph Cornell, a drawing and a sculpture by H.C. 
Westermannand a 1953 abstraction by Franz Kline will be offered in the May 2 
sale. The auction roster also lists two paintings each by Jean Dubuffet, Sam 
Francis, Arshile Gorky, Philip Guston and Robert Rauschenberg and two groups of 
ceramic cups by Kenneth Price. 
</P>
<P>
One piece, Edward Kienholz's 1959 mixed-media construction called "Walter 
Hopps, Hopps, Hopps" ($60,000 to $80,000), is a witty tribute to an art world 
impresario who helped shape Los Angeles' development as an art center and 
became Janss' friend and adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran and Mitchell-Inness characterize the Janss collection as one of 
personal choices, loosely woven together by a thread of Surrealism. Though only 
Magritte's 1946 five-panel painting, "L'Evidence Eternelle," is clearly Surreal 
and works such as the Diebenkorn defy any connection to that movement, many 
pieces convey a sense of strangeness. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Hockney, it's merely the suggestion that much is going on 
beneath the surface of a fantastic procession. Jean Delville's 1892 "Portrait 
of Madame Stuart Merrill," on the other hand, is a typically peculiar Symbolist 
work that depicts a possessed woman with a halo of wild red hair entering a 
magical state as she rolls her eyes into her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran said that her father never changed his mind about an artwork he had 
purchased and rarely sold pieces from his collection. He was in the news in 
1978, however, for the sale of Jasper Johns' "According to What" to Dominique 
de Menil. "The painting had become so important that it was always in demand 
for exhibitions. My father hated to have it off the wall, so he decided to sell 
it at the end of the Whitney show (a retrospective that toured for more than a 
year)," Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
The family has retained some small artworks and those that were intended as 
gifts, she said, but all the "major pieces" are up for sale. Sotheby's May 2 
auction also includes 19 Pop artworks from the collection of the late German 
industrialist Karl Stroher.

Vast New Wallace Wing Opens at Met Museum
---
By Manuela Hoelterhoff</HL>
<DD> 03/17/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a recent party for the huge new 20th-century wing at the Metropolitan Museum, the deceased donor of this art hangar was praised for sharing her "wealth and vision." 
Lila Acheson Wallace's wealth had never been in doubt. 
But that night her Reader's Digest millions were bodied forth in 60,000 square feet of exhibition space, which cost $26 million, $11 million of it Wallace money. 
Her vision, though, did not hit you in the eye. 

   The checks bought a barn of a wing for a collection as spotty as a Dalmatian and not half as beautiful. 
Reluctant to mix its historical mission with contemporary work, the Met has relied on haphazard donations and didn't open a department of 20th-century art until 1970. 
This attitude left it far behind in the feverish race to collect 20th-century art. 
The Wallace wing is obviously a sign of a major conversion, a major committment to the century of Picasso and Pollock and Johns. 
But that century will be over in less than 13 years. 
Even if something had to be done for "our time" before it became "the past" -- why so much space for so little content? 

   The best way to make sense out of the puzzling Wallace wing is to see it as the last bulge in the Met's master plan for expansion conceived under megalomaniacal former director Thomas Hoving, that figment of '60s optimism and arrogance who is now praising luxury consumption and lambasting other museum directors as editor of Connoisseur magazine. 

   Mr. Hoving's plan has been inflating toward completion since 1970, in a series of glass-walled wings designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates. 
Soon the museum's park facade will be almost completely obscured by the firm's nondescript structures, in particular the Robert Lehman Wing. 
Finished in 1975, this diamond-shaped vacuity should have been a warning to the museum about the perils of accepting big, highly restricted gifts designed to glorify the donor in perpetuity. 

   Until the Wallace wing, the creepy Lehman cenotaph was the most debatable part of the expansion. 
When Lehman trustees threatened to ship the collection, kit and caboodle, to another city, the Met tied down the goods by meeting conditions that make telling commentary on death-transcending egomania disguised as patronage: House the works in a wing embellished with the banker's name and position it on axis with the Fifth Avenue entrance. 
Only public protest kept Mr. Hoving from ripping out the glorious Grand Staircase so that visitors could whiz into Lehman's memorial unobstructed. 
There was the feeling then that the Met was just a wee eager, and even today one can't help thinking that, remarkable as many works are, the collection in toto doesn't merit the space. 

   Similar thoughts overwhelm a visitor to the Wallace wing. 
The entrance is uninspiring. 
We see the door to the men's room and a water fountain. 
To the left, there is a very long sales desk. 
In addition to the usual gewgaws and posters it offers "Pablo," a kit that says you can make art by fitting together the provided bits and pieces. 
Such a delusionary concept of creativity is not restricted to purchasers. 
Just around a few corners is a large-scale "Robert" -- a big, shoebox-shaped room stuffed with odds and ends by Robert Rauschenberg. 
The vaguely biographical display (shirts, books, photographs) looks like an M.F.A. project by a sloppy student and is an attempt to fill up this awkward special exhibitions space. 

   Centrally imbedded in the first floor, "Robert" sticks out like a big sore toe, and you keep hitting it because the floor plan is so confusing. 
Architect Roche has shaped painting galleries that are pleasingly proportioned and sympathetically lit. 
But because of their contents, these galleries don't unfold in a historically meaningful way. 

   The first two rooms are typical. 
They mix European and American paintings and they're too uneven in quality to engage in any compelling transatlantic dialogue. 
One lingers happily over Pierre Bonnard's melancholic "Woman with Mimosa," and turns speedily from a particularly dreary group of freaks by James Ensor. 

   Criticism may abate in front of the spectacular wall of Picassos, which includes the portrait of chunky Gertrude Stein ready to do battle with the world of words. 
But such major works also point up glaring gaps. 
You could not surmise that Europe's cubist and expressionist movements were the penetrating influences on 20th-century art from the Met's paltry assortment. 
What the Met has a lot of are early- and mid-20th century works by American painters. 
There's nothing wrong with that, except many are as dull as Walt Kuhn's "Apples from Maine," and the profusion contrasts weirdly with the skimpy space reserved for the decorative arts. 

   Design arguably affects us more directly than paintings. 
Yet the museum only needs one room to detail this century's "Decorative and Industrial Design." 
The result (can it be otherwise?) is a hideous hodgepodge of chairs, lamps and tables. 

   If this is depressing, brace yourself for what lies ahead on the mezzanine level and the second floor. 
The blue-painted room displaying the Berggruen Klee Collection is an intimate enough space for viewing Paul Klee's poignant whimsies, despite the egregious linking of donor and artist names. (Can't people give art away these days without slapping their names over it or buying a wing? 
Long forgotten is the modest example of Louisine Havemeyer, whose extraordinary bequest to the Met in the 1920s didn't come wrapped in self-promoting strings. 

   Given the simple pleasantness of the Klee room, you wonder how the same architect could shape the claustrophobic sculpture gallery a few yards away. 
Narrow and high, it looks like a loading dock. 
Any minute strong men in vans will take away these heaps of steel and wood. 

   Revive your spirit for a moment by ascending to the second floor. 
Here is the collection's mid-century masterpiece, Jackson Pollock's "Autumn Rhythm," hung a little high, but still exhilarating. 
Curiously, though, neither Pollock nor even Willem de Kooning takes center stage at the Met. 
The artist who through sheer profusion of works (seven! canvases donated last year by his widow) seems to be promoted to Genius of the Century is Clyfford Still. 
Yes, one-note Clyff, who painted flames with the obsession of a bonkers fireman. 
Still always thought he was too exalted to show with other artists, and a display like this one makes you wonder about the nature of the bequest. 
There is no canvas by fellow transcendentalist Barnett Newman. 

   Of course, nothing in the Wallace wing is stuck to the walls permanently, and eventually the Met will rotate some works and no doubt be given others. 
But the problems here go beyond quibbles over why one artist has been hung and not the other. 
The real question is, why this wing? 
The best pieces could easily have been grouped together and shown more effectively in a smaller space not costing about $1 million annually to operate. 
Why create a vacuum so you can fill it? 
New York has no shortage of exhibition opportunities for 20th-century art, but far fewer places for works plucked from the matrix of European civilization. 
The Met's repositories are bursting with masterworks it has no room to show, and the new wing was, in fact, originally meant to alleviate this space crunch. 

   In the original master plan, what is now the Wallace wing was earmarked for the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, which could have filled every acre with its 60,000 pieces ranging from Florentine statues and French fans to German furniture. (The department now is able to show only 30% of its collectionless if you subtract the quality snuffboxes, timepieces and porcelains stuck in old-fashioned vitrines in the infrequently open basement galleries.) 
But the fortunes of this treasure-stuffed, scholarly department waned with the lurching growth of the 20th-century department. 

   Money, of course, drove this growth. 
Money from people like Mrs. Wallace and her advisers, who think space is better spent showing a Julian Schnabel painting covered with broken plates than a remarkable collection of perfect Meissen porcelain. 

   Perhaps the Met has the wrong friends. 
In what amounted to a popularity contest settled by the Wallace millions, the 20th-century department chewed off one floor and then gobbled up the whole wing. 
ESDA will receive some new galleries in the old building and a pied-a-terre in a still-unbuilt winglet that completes the master plan. 
It's still not enough room for a department intended to survey the embellishment of Europe from the early Renaissance to the fin de siecle. 
Already, squeezing ESDA's galleries into this winglet has meant cutting down on a projected spacious garden court with French sculptures that could have been one of the museum's memorable spaces. 
The Met needs to ponder its priorities.

<TEXT>     Perhaps his best-known work, No. 34 of the series "Elegy to the Spanish
Republic," brought $880,000 at auction in New York in May 1989.;    The
series, which Motherwell painted over a 30-year period, used dark, grotesque
forms to suggest the end of Spanish liberty under Gen. Francisco Franco. He
stopped painting them after Franco died in 1975 and democracy was
reestablished in Spain.;    Another of Motherwell's elegies, a mural depicting
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, was labeled "an outrage" and
"hideous" by Boston critics when it was unveiled there in 1966.;     A Boston
curator said one of its shapes "may represent the profile of the president's
head, a very specific depiction of the most brutal moment of the tragedy" when
Kennedy was shot.;    THE ARTIST, however, defended it not as a concept of
death but "an expression of grief for someone dead, like a Requiem Mass.";   
Motherwell was born in Aberdeen, Wash., earned a bachelor's degree in
philosophy from Stanford University in 1937 and then did graduate work at
Harvard, the University of Grenoble in France and Columbia University.;   
After traveling in Europe, he settled in New York.;    Using brilliant colors
and odd shapes to convey his inner feelings, Motherwell, who was primarily
self-taught, drew on cubists and surrealists for his earliest inspirations.;  
 His "Elegy to the Spanish Republic," with its columnar thrusts juxtaposed
beside odd masses -- all painted in stark black and white -- was, he said
years later, an examination of both the Spanish ordeal and himself.;    In a
1984 interview in the New York Times, Motherwell said he was "groping for a
way for synthesizing a lifetime of work -- driving further what I find most
valuable and dropping parts that seem less essential.";    Henry Seldis, the
late Los Angeles Times art critic, said after viewing a Motherwell exhibit at
the Otis Art Institute Gallery in Los Angeles in 1974 that the abstractionist
had "endured in his eminently successful attempt to seek out the essence of
the nature of existence through his very own pictorial language.";    He also
was considered unique among the New York school of abstract expressionists for
his ability to change with the times and still remain relevant.;    THE
ANTHOLOGY "Contemporary Artists" writes that "instead of developing a single
'trademark' image like Mark Rothko's soft rectangles or Jackson Pollock's
dripped-line maze, Motherwell has allowed his image world to evolve naturally,
feeding on itself while taking additional nourishment from the art ideas that
are in the air around him.";    In 1983, Time magazine critic Robert Hughes
called Motherwell "a painter of superb though admittedly fitful balance who
has managed to raise a magisterial syntax of form over an undrainable pond of
anxiety.";    Motherwell also became known for his writings about art, which
appeared in such publications as the New Republic and Art News. He taught art
for many years at Hunter College in New York.;    Fellow abstract artist
Carmen Cicero called Motherwell, a former teacher of his, "extraordinarily
intelligent. Conversation with him was a true pleasure. He has both wit and
profundity."  </TEXT>

<P>
Five months have passed since Pat DeMar was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's 
disease, a paralyzing and fatal illness, and still her hands have not betrayed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"The disease takes everything away," she says. "What I can still do, though, is 
paint." 
</P>
<P>
Her canvas isn't made of paper but of cloth. DeMar paints abstract swirls and 
fluid lines on vintage tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
She has learned to hold the paint brush differently to overcome the weakness in 
her hands, but the illness has not interfered with her deft strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities -- walking, driving, cooking a meal -- are no longer possible. 
She speaks with difficulty. She's been told by doctors that she is dying -- a 
prognosis she refuses to accept. She is 32. 
</P>
<P>
It's the painting that gets her up in the morning. To her, it's not a pastime 
but a passion that she discovered when she was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar's hand-painted tuxedos bring a new twist to formal wear. She typically 
paints the jackets' lapels, and sometimes the front and backs. Often, she'll 
adorn the tuxedo with some kind of whimsical decoration. 
</P>
<P>
One of her hottest new creations is a tuxedo garnished with miniature utensils, 
which she has dubbed "the dinner jacket." 
</P>
<P>
She decorated another tuxedo with seashells on its lapels, a reflection of her 
love of the ocean. She also created a white tuxedo shirt with shells on the 
front bib. 
</P>
<P>
"One Texas oil man wanted a tux with oil derricks painted all over it," DeMar 
says. She obliged. 
</P>
<P>
For Christmas, she'll introduce holiday tuxedos arrayed with miniature toys, 
ornaments and red chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
One can see the influence of her favorite artists on the tuxedos. An ivory 
tuxedo she named after artist Jackson Pollock comes with Pollock-style 
splatters of inky black paint on the front and down one side of the back. Her 
love of Oriental art reveals itself in a cream-colored tuxedo with an Oriental 
woman painted on the front. 
</P>
<P>
"My designs really come from the past," she confesses. 
</P>
<P>
Her customers include top celebrities. Bette Midler bought a tuxedo with 
multicolored abstract swirls on the lapels. Diana Ross bought a short, white, 
bolero-style jacket with an abstract design, then called and ordered a skirt to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Fairchild has the so-called rosebud jacket, featuring tiny fabric roses 
on the lapels and swirling stems on the front. Mick Jagger, Rob Lowe, Paula 
Abdul and Candy Spelling own DeMar's designs, and Donna Rice bought a pair of 
her painted earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her customers are women 25 to 50, but men also buy her clothes. Her 
art-to-wear sells all over the world -- without any promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't advertise," DeMar says. "As an artist, I'm kind of a recluse. I just 
like to paint and get my product out there." 
</P>
<P>
The tuxedos are available to store buyers in garment showrooms in Dallas, Los 
Angeles and Chicago. In Orange County, she sells her line through The Look and 
Apropos in Fashion Island, Newport Beach, and From Laguna in Laguna Beach. The 
tuxedos cost from about $300 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
Her partner, Michael Laux, helps her run what has become a $200,000-a-year 
business, handling all of the production work so that she can design the 
clothing from her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now my legs," she says. With his assistance, she continues to create a 
new line of clothing four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The pair work out of an upstairs studio off Coast Highway in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of DeMar's desire to paint, to embellish the ordinary, is everywhere: 
Painted tuxedos fill a circular rack in the center of the room. In one corner, 
there's a stack of bracelets she made from hand-painted fiberglass -- the same 
material used to make surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were discontinued -- most people don't want bracelets that big," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Her line of aluminum copper earrings hangs on one wall like miniature artworks. 
DeMar hand-paints each large earring with a colorful abstract design. The 
earrings have sold at Nordstrom, Bullock's and Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to painting tuxedos, she decorates baby clothes, shoes, kimonos, 
hats, T-shirts, chiffon tops and silk skirts with her flowing brushwork. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar and Laux have a factory in El Toro where garments are cut, sewn and made 
ready for the artist's hand. The vintage tuxedos come from second-hand stores 
and dealers all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar has also started painting vintage velvet coats. She decorated one black 
velvet swing coat with a serpentine design in gold on the lapels and sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
She has been painting clothes for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working in oil and acrylic, doing large canvases, when a bunch of people 
started doing hand-painted clothing. It looked so interesting, I started doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
She later began manufacturing the clothes to paint on. Only the disease has 
slowed her down. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I got sick," she says. "First I started limping, and then I 
started dropping things." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors first assumed that she had a pinched nerve, but her condition worsened. 
She could no longer walk. Laux took her to leading neurologists, who made the 
diagnosis -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, a degenerative 
nervous-system disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fatal and not real pretty," DeMar says. Doctors told her there was no 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not giving into that," Laux adds. "We're not subscribing to that 
diagnosis. There's no acid test for Lou Gehrig's disease." 
</P>
<P>
DeMar has refuted the stark prognosis and now undergoes alternative treatments. 
She travels to Santa Cruz and Idaho for ancient Chinese medicine, including 
deep tissue massage and acupressure. The treatments are painful and costly 
(they are not covered by insurance), but DeMar says she's starting to feel 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Five months ago, I could barely talk," she says. "And I couldn't open my 
hands. Now I've gotten a lot of that back." 
</P>
<P>
An art auction is planned for Nov. 4 at Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach to 
help pay her medical costs. Prominent artists will donate their work for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, DeMar will continue to rise each morning and reach for her 
paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard on me," she says. "A lot of the business used to be meeting with 
buyers and finding out what people wanted. Now, I'm a lot more limited. 
</P>
<P>
"What keeps me sane is for me to come here and paint. If I didn't have this, 
I'd go home and die."

<HEAD>Gallery Showcases Images of Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID S. MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEWISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan is a mythical centaur. He's
also Rocky, a human television set and a warrior in what is billed
as the first art exhibit to feature a sitting president.
   These images of Reagan by nearly 40 artists, including Andy
Warhol and Red Grooms, appear in an exhibit titled ``Reagan:
American Icon'' at Bucknell University's Center Gallery.
   The show, featuring works done in the past eight years, opened
Jan. 14 and will run through March 23. Reagan will yield the
presidency to George Bush on Jan. 20.
   ``It's unprecedented that a president has had contemporary
artists do this many images of him,'' said Robert P. Metzger, the
gallery's director, who added that the exhibit was the first of its
kind for a president still in office.
   The Reagan interpretations range from flattering to critical, but
Metzger was quick to point out the exhibit was put together based on
the quality of the art, not politics.
   ``You don't go out of your way to offend someone with an art
exhibit, but on the other hand, art is not docile. We do want to
arouse people; we want to make them think,'' he said.
   The show includes:
   _ Two Andy Warhol screenprints of Reagan in Van Heusen shirt
advertisements published during the president's acting days.
   _ A mock wooden toy by Red Grooms showing Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev standing on a missile connected to four
wagon wheels titled ``Nuclear Nuts.''
   _ A heroic depiction of Reagan as a centaur _ half horse, half
man _ by the Moscow-born artists Komar and Melamid.
   _ A ceramic image by Robert Arneson of Reagan as a television
set, the president's smiling face coming out of the screen, a wire
hand as the antenna and a warning on the back: ``Do not expose this
appliance to thought or reason.''
   _ A painting by Israeli-born artist Ori Hofmekler titled ``Ronnie
II'' showing Reagan as the Sylvester Stallone movie character Rocky
Balboa, sporting boxing gloves and shorts and wearing a championship
belt with the presidential seal on it.
   _ A lifelike portrait of Reagan by Leon McFadden, with the
president's face covered by tiny, nearly invisible logos of all of
the Fortune 500 companies.
   The show contains two paintings of Nancy Reagan and one of the
president and first lady together.
   It also has books, articles, posters, photographs, buttons,
T-shirts and postcards about the Reagans culled from Metzger's
personal collection of 50,000 books and 50 filing cabinets filled
with memorabilia about celebrities ranging from Marilyn Monroe to
the artist Jackson Pollock.
   Metzger said he conceived the idea for the show several years ago
but did not think enough work with Reagan as the subject would exist
until at least 1991.
   To find the work, Metzger quizzed museum directors, talked to
artists and went to galleries in New York City.
   ``It was just detective work tracking down the material,'' he
said. ``When I began the search I didn't know there was enough for a
show. I was sort of groping. Who would have guessed?''
   Metzger, who has a doctorate in art history from the University
of California signed by Reagan when he was California's governor,
said the show is historically significant because it is done by
artists while Reagan was still in office.
   ``This will be a show that will be a watershed,'' he said.
``There's probably no other show at any other museum devoted to one
person. There just isn't the material.''
   Even though almost all of the images of Reagan depict him in his
role as president, it was Reagan's former life as an actor which
attracted the artists, Metzger said.
   ``I do think it's this duality of his life. ... It's captured the
imagination of a lot of contemporary artists,'' he said.

<HEAD>Note Engraver and Painter Dead at 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The painter and engraver William Stanley Hayter,
who taught his innovative printmaking techniques to such renowned
artists as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali, is dead at age 86.
   Hayter died of cardiac arrest Wednesday in Paris, where he had
been a leading figure in the art scene since the 1920s.
   The International Herald Tribune said Friday that Hayter was
credited with turning engraving into a lively and experimental form
that attracted many famous artists to his studio in Montparnasse.
   Among those visiting the studio he called Atelier 17 were
Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jackson Pollock, Dali and Picasso.
   Hayter was born in London in 1901 and graduated from Kings
College, London, with honor degrees in art and chemistry. He worked
in Iran from 1922 to 1925 for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., but his
first interest was art.
   ``My father was a painter, and (so were) a lot of people in my
family before, so I was messing about with painting fairly
seriously when I was a child,'' he once said. ``I was painting all
the time when I was in the (Middle) East. I didn't do much with
prints until I came to Paris.''
   He discovered the vanishing art of original printmaking and
revolutionized it with new techniques, including a method of color
printing from a single plate instead of using a separate plate for
each tone.
   Hayter wrote two books that are essential reading for print
makers: ``New Ways of Gravure'' (1949) and ``About Prints'' (1962).
   He lived in Paris from 1926 to 1939, when he moved his studio to
the New School in New York and gave impetus American printmaking.
He returned to Paris in 1950.

<HEAD>The Artists: Segal Adds Color and Gets Religion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Segal, whose life-size sculptures
turned him into a pop art icon in the 1960s, is molding his plaster
into other shapes.
   The 64-year-old American artist is adding color and religious
themes to his work and is even trying theater designs.
   In his first major European show of the decade, at a seafront
casino in this beach resort, Segal has included his trademark
plasters, but this time in either rusty or vivid tones to add
contrast. A series of pastel paintings is also on show, revealing a
new side the artist perfected in the 1980s.
   Biblical themes such as the Expulsion and Abraham's farewell to
Ishmael are on show alongside his ghostly plasters, which seem to
sleepwalk through modern society.
   The soft-spoken sculptor avoid questions about these changes.
``You have to follow your own logic,'' he said in an interview in
the garden of the Knokke casino owners.
   Segal made a stopover here to open his show following a
three-week stay in Moscow, where he designed his first theater set
for director Maximilian Schell.
   He said he never felt trapped by the plaster sculptures that shot
him to fame with such pop artists as Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg,
Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein.
   ``When pop art first became noticed, I felt I was sitting on the
tail of a rocket,'' said Segal. ``Amazingly, it still flies.''
   And it is still spanning the globe.
   He said interest in Japan had increased in the 1980s to the
extent that he had to reduce his presence in Europe, where he made
his first international breakthrough at the Parisian gallery of
Ileana Sonnabend in 1963. In the '70s, the West Germany contemporary
art museums stocked their showrooms with his plasters.
   Now he is back on the Continent, even making a rare detour to the
Soviet Union. Schell lured him into a Moscow theater to create the
decor for ``Faith, Love, Hope,'' a 1936 play by Austrian Odon Von
Horvath, because the stage director thought ``the dark, gray, grim
mood of the sculptures was similar to the mood of the play,'' Segal
said.
   Returning to the Soviet Union for the first time in 15 years
brought equally bleak visions of Soviet society to life for Segal,
despite the spirit of glasnost. ``It is just as grim. There is less
food and more cars.''
   His return there also proves his appeal has remained
undiminished. ``I never expected to be so popular over such a large
part of the world,'' he said.
   Segal still uses his chicken farm in New Jersey as a studio and
he continues to work at a steady pace, not pressured by increasing
demands and prizes.
   ``I just refused to accelerate production,'' he said, explaining
that it could have changed his art.
   Segal was first a painter, pursuing the impressionistic style of
Matisse, before a nagging insecurity pushed him toward experimenting
with plaster and wire in the late '50s. He soon started making molds
of models and placed them in real settings.
   His work was lauded by other pop art greats.
   ``We all knew each other. We went in and out of each other's
studio. We all shared basic ideas,'' he said. ``We were in reaction
against pure abstraction and wanted to reintroduce the real world.''
   Instead of abstract expressionist drippings of Jackson Pollock,
pop art produced such pieces of ``reality'' as Warhol's Campbell's
soup cans, Lichtenstein's blown-up cartoons and Segal's sculptures.
   Segal has gone on from there, and his pieces now increasingly
resemble the academic works of 19th-century sculptors such as Rodin,
another master in creating theatrical composition.
   Segal's method, however, is anything but traditional.
   He puts pieces of cloth dipped in plaster on a live model and
waits until they harden on the body. The uneasiness of the situation
brings out the real emotions in the models he said, and gives his
work much of its authenticity.
   ``It's very hard to be a fake with that kind of wet discomfort
over such a long period of time.
   ``They suffer for my art,'' he said with a grin.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Forward planning or wishful thinking? - Antony
Thorncroft talks to director of the Tate Gallery Nicholas Serota about his
dreams for Bankside
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nicholas Serota has been making a list . . . and indulging in a pleasing
fantasy: detailing the works of art that he would like to acquire for the
Tate Gallery. Suddenly, his wish list is not just idle fancy.
A new 'Tate Gallery of Modern Art' already seems a likely candidate for a
National Lottery-funded millennium grant. The building - the abandoned power
station on Bankside - is in place; the short-list of architects to design
the transformation is selected; the Tate is confident that it can raise
Pounds 40m, half the cost, from its own resources. It is almost time to fix
the opening day in 2000 and draw up the guest list.
In the meantime Serota is planning how to stock his creation. The old Tate
will remain the home of British art; the new Tate, which will be roughly the
same size as the old building at Millbank, will continue the international
history of art where the National Gallery leaves off, somewhere around 1905.
As a new century and a new millennium starts, there might be some gentle
horse-trading between our two leading art museums, which these days enjoy a
good relationship. Neil MacGregor at the National Gallery might pass over a
Picasso or a Braque to the Tate in return for a Whistler or a Sargent, in a
little chronological tidying up.
It will, however, be minor stuff. The bulk of the display at the Bankside
Tate, which will total around 1,000 paintings and sculptures, will come from
the Tate's current collection: half from key works already frequently on
view, the other half promoted from the vaults which, through pressure of
space, always contain most of the Tate's holdings.
But approaching a third of the hang at Bankside, around 300 works, will,
with luck, be acquired in the next five years. These will be modern
masterpieces that will plug gaps in the Tate's collection.
And gaps there certainly are. Serota checks off his want list. 'We've not
much German or northern art; we want more Picasso and Matisse; we're not
strong on the Russian constructivists; we've no Latin American art; we've
not got the depth of the MOMA (New York) in pre-war art, or the Pompidou
(Paris) in post-war.'
Now the names come rushing out. 'I'd love a late Bonnard, Matisse, Dix and
Beckmann, Corinth, Giacometti, Brancusi, late Braque; we are not good on the
Cubists'. There is also the need to keep acquiring the contemporary - two of
the five chronological divisions envisaged in the Bankside Tate will be
devoted to post-1960 art.
Serota is proposing a three pronged attack. Some of the works on his list
will come from loans, some from gifts and some from purchases. It is the
thought of entering the market with a cheque book that gives Serota most
pleasure. For over a decade the Tate's annual grant for new purchases has
been frozen, a decade in which prices have soared. In the 1960s and early
1970s the Tate could still buy wisely and cheaply - a Brancusi 'Bird' for
Pounds 23,000; a Giacometti for Pounds 25,000. By the late 1980s the best
works of contemporary artists like Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and de
Kooning, to say nothing of established masters like Picasso, Matisse and
Braque, were fetching over Pounds 10m in the saleroom.
The Tate was forced to the sidelines. With help from the Friends of the Tate
there have been some purchases - a Richard Hamilton was acquired only last
week - but Serota says wistfully 'I can almost always find something in a
Sotheby's or a Christie's catalogue that I would like.'
Wishes could become horses, thanks, once again, to the lottery. The Heritage
Lottery Fund is prepared to be convinced that major works of art, suddenly
on the market, might make an essential contribution to the British heritage
 -even if created by a Frenchman or an American. Serota hopes that if
something marvellous comes up the Tate stands a chance of securing it, even
if it carries a Pounds 5m price tag. This should embrace most of the
masterpieces of the past generation, the area where Serota thinks the Tate
can still build up a collection the equal of anything in Paris and New York.
After purchases come loans. This is the trickiest area. There are many
dealers who would love to loan works by their artists in the certain
knowledge that a spell on the walls of the Tate enhances their reputation
and value. The Tate is circumspect here. Loans from serious collectors, and
especially from artists, are acceptable, especially as a loan can, over
time, merge into a gift.
The Tate has a good relationship with artists and will be looking for
immediate gifts from them. This, too, can be a delicate matter: artists like
to see their donations move swiftly from the vaults to the walls. In recent
years the Tate has gratefully accepted a Francis Bacon triptych; a portrait
head from Lucian Freud; a whole room full of works by Mark Rothko. When the
Tate bought a Jasper Johns the artist threw in some sculptures and prints on
loan; Giacometti sold a sculpture for a nominal price. Most artists will be
attracted by the idea of ensuring immortality by contributing a work to
Bankside - or so Serota hopes.
The Tate has been so successful in recent years that it is hard to imagine
that this, Serota's greatest project, will fall apart. Let's leave him
planning the future, acquiring two master works a year - 'a great Beckmann
and a late Bonnard; then a Picasso sculpture and an Otto Dix; a Giacometti
to make a display never seen in the UK before, and another Brancusi . . .'

   New York -- Imagine that you have a very wealthy and
perspicacious old aunt and that she has a garage full of
memorabilia from the 1940s. This includes not only paintings
and sculptures, but Tupperware containers, chairs designed by
famous architects and artists, industrial objects (such as a
giant propeller blade from the St. Regis Paper Company),
streamlined household objects (including elegant old
typewriters and watches), photographs by famous photographers
of equally famous writers and scientists, and even a bright
red Cisitalia 202 GT sports car designed by Pinin Farina.
   Some aunt. Some garage.

   Well, the aunt in this case is one of New York's most
visible grande dames, the Museum of Modern Art. And the
garage is the grande dame's basement, which doubles as her
special exhibition space. The show is called "Art of the
Forties," and like the decade to which it is dedicated, it is
at once wonderful and awful. Wonderful because it is such a
hodgepodge, and awful for exactly the same reason.
   Although this exhibition focuses on the variety of
artistic expression during what was arguably the most
tumultuous decade of our tumultuous century, this is not an
"idea" or theme show. In fact, any ideas that creep in seem
to do so more or less by accident. Instead some 300 objects
of varied shapes and sizes, drawn from the museum's own
collections, are crammed into the already cramped galleries
with very little explanation as to the rhyme or reason behind
their choice or their arrangement. This is more than a little
bit confusing, but it also has the great virtue of letting
the objects speak for themselves without being overwhelmed by
extravagant interpretations.
   Although the show is not organized in a particularly
thoughtful way, it has some charming, clever and even moving
moments. In one gallery, a grippingly realistic 1943 Ben
Shahn poster announcing "This Is Nazi Brutality" is set next
to Jacques Lipchitz's semi-abstract drawing of the "Rape of
Europa." Nearby are Edward Hopper's desolate 1940 roadside
scene called "Gas" and Pablo Picasso's allegorical "Charnel
House" of 1945 -- pictures that evoke the lingering
Depression mentality of the beginning of the decade and the
extraordinary world-wide convulsions that occurred during its
first five years. But just a little further along is a
leading candidate for the booby prize as Worst Museum
Installation of the Year: 17 colorful plates from Matisse's
1947 illustrated book "Jazz" arranged as decorations around a
doorway]
   One of the most impressive things about this show is its
indication of just how much art this particular aunt has in
her storage vaults and rarely shows to visitors. Artists like
Honore Sharrer, Morris Hirshfield, Rico Lebrun, Alton Pickens
and Salvatore Fiume are not exactly familiar names, even
among regular museumgoers, and it is nice to have an
opportunity to see their work in relation to their
better-known contemporaries. (One also can't help but be
impressed by how assiduously MoMA followed contemporary art
back then; many of the works shown were acquired within a
year or two of their creation.)
   But in the end, the choice of artists is also a mixed bag.
For along with some interesting resurrections (and, alas,
some rather awkward disinterments), there are also some
amazing omissions. Picasso, Matisse and Miro are included;
but Stuart Davis, Georges Braque and Hans Arp -- all of whom
were particularly influential during the '40s -- are
inexplicably left out. Some major artists, such as David
Smith, are represented by surprisingly minor works that give
very little sense of their importance at the time.
   The rationale behind the mixture of "high art" and objects
from everyday life also remains unclear. Is this show
supposed to be primarily an artistic portrait of the decade,
or a social one, or both? And if the social element is
supposed to be of real importance, why is no attention given
to what must have been the most influential source of imagery
in America during the 1940s, Life magazine?
   In the latter half of the show, where the installation
focuses increasingly on paintings, familiar names prevail and
there is an increasing unity of pictorial thought. In fact,
the last few galleries, which are dominated by American
abstract artists, constitute a kind of picture essay about
the triumph of American abstract painting toward the end of
the decade. The gathering of major works that the museum
collected -- by artists such as Robert Motherwell, Jackson
Pollock, Willem DeKooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still --
remains very impressive and reflects a unity of purpose that
is not always apparent in the earlier galleries.
   This in itself gives one food for thought. In recent years
there has been a lot of talk about "the new pluralism" in
art, in which virtually any kind of imagery is permissible
and no single style dominates. In fact, as this show makes
clear, the new pluralism is really not new at all.
   Nor should we think it started in the 1940s. Pluralism, it
seems to me, is one of the characteristic conditions of
artistic expression in the modern world. It is not that the
variety of artistic expression has increased so much in
recent years, but that critical thinking has become less
partisan and less focused. This, in turn, seems to be a
reflection of new marketing strategies for art, in which
diversification has come to be seen as a better bet than a
narrowly held position. Pluralism has long been present in
modern art -- even the impressionists represented only a
small corner of late 19th-century painting and were
themselves a rather diverse lot. Until recently, however, the
strategies of criticism and of the market emphasized what
were held to be dominant styles, and this flattened out our
perception of what was actually being produced at a given
moment.
   In fact, if "Art of the Forties" makes us aware of just
how pluralistic that decade was, it is in no small measure
because so many of the works in it are usually consigned to
storage. One of the most stimulating aspects of this show is
the direct result of its lack of focus, which invites us to
see beyond the narrow categories into which so much recent
art has been squeezed. Despite its faults, this backward look
at the decade that brought us to midcentury may provide us
with some valuable insights about the decade that will bring
us to its end.
   The exhibition, which is accompanied by an extensive
program of American and European films of the 1940s, will be
on view until April 30.
