   EDITOR'S NOTE - It's been more than a decade since the Love
Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y., was evacuated, declared
unfit for human habitation because of pollution from a toxic
chemical dump. Now people are beginning to return to the
neighborhood as the debate continues over the threat to their
health.

   Television cameras rolled as brawny
men lugged Richard Horn's and Sandra DeVantier's furniture,
appliances and a set of golf clubs into their small brick ranch
house.
   Passers-by stopped to stare. The mayor proclaimed it the biggest
day in the city's history.
   Twelve years after chemicals leaking into the basements of a
middle-class neighborhood made Love Canal a symbol of America's
toxic waste problems, people were finally moving back to the area.
   ``It has been a long battle,'' says Mayor Michael O'Laughlin.
``The fact that a person finally moved furniture in is an
outstanding accomplishment in the environmental world.''
   Indeed, much has changed at Love Canal since the summer of 1978
when the leaking chemicals dumped there three decades earlier by
Hooker Chemicals &amp; Plastics Corp. set off a nationwide scare about
unseen poisons lurking beneath the earth.
   An elementary school and hundreds of houses built on and near
the dump in the years after Hooker abandoned it have been
bulldozed, literally plowed into the ground.
   The 70-acre site where children played amid chemical volcanoes
and explosive ``fire rocks'' is now a green, grassy mound, fenced
off from the world. The 22,000 tons of chemicals that remain in the
earth are contained by a system of underground drains that, the
government says, should catch any leaks before they can threaten
the rest of the neighborhood.
   The neighborhood even has a new name - Black Creek Village.
   But one thing hasn't changed since those scary days. Scientists
and environmental officials are still divided on whether Love Canal
is, or ever will be, a safe place to live.
   The debate has echoed through the halls of power in Washington
and the halls of justice in Buffalo and Niagara Falls. It has even
ripped apart one of New York's largest environmental groups.
   The state Health Department reported in 1988 that a portion of
the Love Canal neighborhood was no more polluted than comparable
areas elsewhere in Niagara Falls. After months of delay and
lobbying that reportedly reached into the White House, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly upheld that
study last spring.
   With Reilly's approval in hand, the Love Canal Area
Revitalization Agency put up for sale 10 houses a few blocks north
of the dump site. The agency ultimately hopes to renovate and sell
as many as 250 of the 1,100 houses that the state bought from
fleeing residents in the early 1990s.
   William Broderick, the agency's head, declared Love Canal to be
``probably the safest area in the city of Niagara Falls, because we
know the most about it.'' But he concedes that the agency can't
give home buyers a written guarantee that chemical leaks would not
recur.
   The agency boasted that it had a list of more than 200 people
who were interested in buying houses in the area. But by late
November, only 12 buyers had signed contracts to purchase houses in
the area, and only one house had been occupied - the one bought by
DeVantier and her fiance, Horn. They moved in on Nov. 28.
   Broderick said recently the waiting list evaporated because many
of the people on it were looking to buy homes at ``fire-sale
prices,'' lower than the $40,000 to $60,000 the agency was asking.
Single-family homes in Niagara Falls sold for an average of $49,700
this year, according to the Greater Buffalo Board of Realtors.
DeVantier and Horn, who declined to speak to reporters, paid
$54,000 cash for their house.
   Broderick also said the agency's sales efforts were hampered by
the reluctance of many local banks to write mortgages on Love Canal
property.
   But the agency was also dogged by lawsuits from environmental
groups that said the state study hadn't proved the area was safe.
The environmentalists said that comparing Love Canal to other parts
of Niagara Falls was meaningless because the entire city is
permeated by the effluent of its massive chemical industry.

   A replica of the brigantine Niagra, flying a
15-star American flag and Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's ``Don't
Give Up The Ship'' banner sailed Lake Erie Wednesday in its first
sea trial.
   The 182-foot, 278-ton Niagara sailed out of its Erie port onto
the waters where Perry's nine-ship squadron defeated six British
ships during the War of 1812.
   The replica contains 42 pieces of Perry's flagship, mostly
metal, but those parts make up just 20 percent of the present-day
Niagra. It is owned by the state of Pennsylvania, which paid part
of the $3.8 million restoration cost and plans to spend $5 million
on a dock and museum.
   Sailboats and powerboats escorted the Niagara into the lake,
where a crew of 30 handled the ship's 15 sails and executed turns
on placid waters near Presque Isle State Park.
   The crew, led by marine architect Melbourne Smith, wore blue
jeans and red T-shirts. The ship's cannons, cast in steel during
1813's Battle of Lake Erie, were made of aluminum to save weight on
the top deck.
   The Niagara's formal commissioning is scheduled for Aug. 18.
   On Sept. 13, 1813, Perry's first flagship, the USS Lawrence, was
disabled by British fire and Perry moved to the Niagara, where he
flew his famous blue-and-white battle flag and attacked again.
   The Niagara helped break British Commodore Robert Heroit
Barclay's battle line, forcing him to surrender.
   Perry reported to his superiors: ``We have met the enemy and
they are ours.''

   A man who spent 20 years trying to
leave Cuba unwittingly deported himself and his family from the
United States for what he thought would be a 20 minute excursion to
the Canadian side of Niagra Falls.
   Three weeks after they left their Miami home on the trip, Carlos
Fajardo, his wife and two adopted children remain stranded in motel
in Canada.
   They set out Dec. 20 on a Christmas quest for snow, which his
adopted children, Yoandys, 12, and Yordalys, 9, had never seen.
   Even though the family lived in the United States for four years,
immigration officials will not allow them back because they are
illegal aliens.
   ``We came for 20 minutes,'' Fajardo said. ``No one told us we
could not go back.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has joined the Fajardos' cause by asking
officials to let the family back.
   ``This family has strong ties to the Miami community through
relatives, business and local school attendance,'' Graham said in a
letter to Immigration and Naturalization Service officials. ``It
would be comforting to these people for them to be able to resume
their well-established lives.''
   Fajardo, 39, a small, soft-spoken man who tried for two decades
to leave his native Cuba, said the family drove 1,500 miles in their
truck to Niagara Falls, N.Y., where they checked into a motel and
planned to visit Canada.
   He told Canadian border guards his family wanted to see the
Horseshoe Falls.
   When the family returned, however, U.S. border guards demanded to
proof of their citizenship. All Fajardo had was a Florida driver's
license.
   At first, Fajardo maintained he was a U.S. citizen. Later, he
said he was a resident alien. But immigration officials, after a
search of their records, determined otherwise.
   Benedict Ferro, director of the INS office in Buffalo, said
Fajardo's wife, Bermaida, and her two children entered the United
States illegally in 1985 and Fajardo entered the country illegally
in 1986.
   Fajardo denies entering the country illegally.
   An immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to Mrs. Fajardo and
the two children. She appealed the decision in August on grounds
that she would face persecution if returned to communist Cuba, but
her appeal was rejected.
   Fajardo's application for asylum was pending when he crossed the
border. His status was officially nullified by leaving the country,
Ferro said.
   Fajardo could reapply, but his wife and children cannot because
they previously provided fraudulent information to immigration
officials, Ferro said.
   ``The family lied and their credibility is about zero at this
point,'' Ferro said.
   Canadian authorities have given the family permission to stay in
Canada until Sunday. What happens to them after that is uncertain.
   Under terms of a bond he posted in order to leave Cuba, Fajardo
agreed not to return to his homeland. He said he left the country in
1984 with only the clothes on his back.
   He achieved relative prosperity in the United States working in
several jobs, including his current one as a boat builder, and said
he owns a home in Miami.
   As he spoke Tuesday, his wife and children sat watching
television in their small motel room. He would occassionally turn to
the boy, Yoandys, to help him answer in English.
   ``We are all very tired,'' he said. ``The children are missing
school ... We want to go home.''
   Now the family is running low on money, said Sister Margaret
Quinn of Fort Erie, Ontario, who has been providing assistance
through the Niagara Refugee Committee.
   She has urged American and Canadian immigration officials to
allow the family to return to the care of their relatives in Miami,
but says the case seems to be closed.
   ``It's really contrary to the whole spirit of international law
and relations to have them walking about without a country,'' she
said. ``This whole thing is really a mess.''

   The remains of 28 American servicemen found
in Canada in November will be returned to this country for burial
this week, 174 years after they were killed while fighting in the
War of 1812.
   The soldiers will be buried Thursday with full military honors,
including a 21-gun salute, U.S. Army officials said. A plaque also
will be placed in the cemetery in the town of Bath commemorating
the soldiers' deaths in 1814 during the closing days of the Niagra
campaign, the discovery of their remains in 1987 and reburial in
1988.
   ``These boys will be treated as if they died yesterday,'' said
Lt. Col. Robert Trotter. ``Just because we're late doesn't mean
they won't get what they deserve.''
   The skeletons were unearthed by construction workers digging a
house foundation in Fort Erie, Ontario, across the Niagara River
from Buffalo.
   Archaeologists moved the remains to a Toronto laboratory where
most were identified as Americans, Trotter said.
   Trotter said hundreds of sites were considered for the
reburials, but military records indicated most of the men were from
central New York, where Bath is located.
   ``We figure about 90 percent of the men who fought in the
Niagara campaign were from the Finger Lakes area,'' he said. ``It's
only right that they should be going home.''
   Although individual indentification of the remains could not be
made, Ronald Williamson, a Canadian archaeologist who led the
investigation, said the discovery yielded extensive information
about the war between the Americans and the British.
   Williamson said most the soldiers were in their teens and early
20s and died horrible deaths.
   ``The philosophy of medicine at the time was to make a complex
wound simple. If you got shot in the hand, they cut off your arm,''
he said.
   Williamson said the soldiers probably died during the daily
assaults by British mercenaries on a U.S. position at Snake Hill.
The burial ground was a sandy knoll on the shore of Lake Erie.
   Each body showed some preparation before burial, indicating that
the survivors were in a rush, he said. ``These probably weren't
battlefield deaths, but victims of snipers or artillery barrages in
the weeks after the main battle.''
   Military records indicate that about five men were lost each day
during the siege on the position.
   The campaign ended weeks later when American forces withdrew and
the burial ground was apparently forgotten.

   A snag that kept a daredevil from
plunging over Niagra Falls in a barrel probably saved his life,
said the man who promised to try again after he pays the fine for
the failed illegal stunt.
   Dave Munday, who survived going over the falls in a barrel in
1985, was trying to become the first person to live through a
second descent Sunday when his foam-padded barrel got caught on a
rocky shelf about a foot from the edge.
   Munday's 650-pound barrel was left partially hanging over the
brink of the 176-foot Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side of the
Niagara River.
   The area directly below the spot where the current took the
barrel is very rocky, the stuntman said.
   ``I've never been a religious man, but something stopped it,''
he said. ``A lot of the guys said it was fate that stopped it.
Probably I would have been dead if it went over.''
   Munday, 53, of Caistor Center, Ontario, was charged with
violating laws that prohibit river stunts. He faces a possible
$8,500 fine. Police confiscated Munday's 4-foot-by-7-foot barrel
after it was pulled out of the rapids with a crane.
   Munday said he will make another attempt to go over the falls as
soon as he pays the fine. He said he probably won't try the stunt
again this year.
   Niagara Parks Police, who patrol the Canadian side of the twin
waterfalls, said Munday's barrel was dropped into the river about
660 feet above the brink of the Horseshoe Falls about shortly
before 5 a.m. Sunday.
   Police spokesman George Bailey said Ontario Hydro had been
diverting half the river's flow overnight to power its
hydroelectric plant. That kept the river level low, helping snag
Munday's barrel on the rocky ledge, he said.
   Munday said he wanted to be nearer the center of the river,
where the volume of water is greater and provides a better cushion
against the rocks at the bottom.
   On Oct. 5, 1985, Munday became the seventh daredevil to
successfully go over the falls in a vessel. Three others who tried
before him died.
   Last month, a man who went over the falls in a kayak apparently
died. The battered kayak belonging to Jessie Sharp, of Ocoee,
Tenn., was found below the falls, but his body has not been
recovered.
   After his 1985 plunge, Munday told reporters, ``Anyone who would
go over the falls twice would have to be crazy.''

<HEAD>Gore Says Dukakis Remarks Show Foreign Policy Ignorance</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be topped after 9:30 a.m. EDT appearance in Washington.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. says Michael
Dukakis lacks foreign policy experience and ``simply doesn't know
what he's talking about'' when it comes to using nuclear weapons
and American military power.
   Trying to catch up with Dukakis and Jesse Jackson before
Tuesday's important New York primary, Gore maintained Wednesday
that Dukakis had made ``a major blunder'' by discussing in a
newspaper interview when he would use nuclear weapons against the
Soviet Union.
   He stood by his criticism in the face of a strong denial by
Dukakis. The Massachusetts governor said he had merely reflected
existing American and NATO policy in holding open the option of a
nuclear response to a successful Soviet invasion of Western Europe
with conventional forces.
   The Tennesse senator offered broader criticism as well, faulting
Dukakis for advocating a ban on flight testing of ballistic
missiles and for what he said were remarks supporting the
commitment of American troops in the event of Communist invaders in
West Germany or South Korea.
   ``I think in a lot of these matters he simply doesn't know what
he's talking about, and he needs an opportunity to clarify his
remarks and I want to give him an opportuhity to do so,'' Gore said
to reporters.
   A long-distance exchange between the two candidates was touched
off by an interview with Dukakis published Wednesday in the Daily
News of New York. Gore characterized Dukakis' remarks as amounting
to saying ``he would launch a nuclear first strike against the
Soviet Union if they invaded Europe with conventional forces.''
   Dukakis, in Boston, insisted Gore was distorting his comments.
Dukakis said his position was that he would consider the use of
nuclear forces as an option in the event of a successful Soviet
invasion of Europe. ``That has been the policy of our government,''
Dukakis said. ``It is the policy of the NATO alliance.''
   In a transcript provided by the newspaper, Dukakis was asked if
he could conceive of a scenario in which he would use nuclear
weapons first, ``as a strategic weapon.'' His response began,
``Yes, yes. I would hope I wouldn't have to.'' He said he was for
``a policy of no early first use. But our present strategy in
Europe assumes that if the Soviets were to invade and conventional
forces couldn't stop them that we'd reserve the right to use
nuclear force.''
   James Steinberg, the defense and foreign policy adviser to
Dukakis, said Dukakis started answering the question thinking he
was being asked about tactical nuclear weapons. The reference to
``strategic'' was made after Dukakis had started speaking,
Steinberg said.
   Steinberg said he assumed Dukakis would have given a different
answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear
weapons.
   Gore campaign manager Fred Martin insisted Gore had not
distorted Dukakis' words. Both Gore and Martin said Dukakis had
erred in getting into a discussion of nuclear first use.
   ``I think it is most unwise for a president of the United States
or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a
hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces
and trigger destruction of human civilization,'' Gore said. ``To
specify in advance when we would make that fateful step is most
unwise and irresponsible.''
   Appearing later before Westchester County Democrats in Rye
Brook, N.Y., Gore stressed that Dukakis had been asked about
``strategic'' nuclear weapons.
   ``NATO has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,''
Gore said. ``The president of the United States has traditionally
refused to respond to that hypothetical.''
   Gore's criticism and the ensuing flap overshadowed an event
Wednesday when Gore went to the Love Canal toxic waste site at
Niagra Falls to underscore his commitment to environmental
protection and blast the Reagan administration.
   As a congressman, Gore chaired congressional hearings that
looked into the dumping of toxic wastes at the site.

   Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa comes to
the United States holding his head high and his hand out, accepting
praise for forging the first non-Communist government in the Soviet
bloc while seeking money for its survival.
   ``We are building an America of the East,'' but that requires
billions of dollars from the West, Walesa said in an interview
before leaving Poland for his U.S. visit scheduled to begin Monday.
   Walesa's trip will provide a chance for President Bush and
Congress to endorse in words and dollars the changes that are
sweeping the Soviet bloc, and most recently have engulfed East
Germany.
   The stocky, mustachioed electrician, who rocketed to world fame
in August 1980 by clambering over the Gdansk shipyard wall and
leading the strike that created Solidarity, can expect warm words
and warmer hospitality, from the White House ceremony where he
receives the presidential medal of freedom on Monday, to his speech
to members of the House and Senate on Wednesday.
   Nor is he likely to return to Gdansk empty-handed, as Congress
and the Bush administration hammer out a deal providing $555
million to $989 million over three years to bolster the sweeping
reforms enacted in Poland and Hungary.
   During a stop Saturday at Niagra Falls as part of a four-day
trip to Canada, Walesa was mobbed by about 100 people.
   The charismatic leader said outside a meeting with Niagara Falls
Mayor Bill Smeaton that he doesn't want to run for political office
in Poland. In one of his few public utterances, Walesa said in
Polish, ``I prefer to be a small boss.''
   At a Remembrance Day ceremony in Toronto, Walesa helped a Polish
war veteran lay a wreath. The ceremony drew about 2,000 people,
many of whom clutched red and white Solidarity flags.
   Walesa is to meet Monday with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Following that session, Walesa will fly to Washington, where during
a four-day period he will meet with Bush twice, address an AFL-CIO
convention and become the first private foreign citizen in 175 year
to address a joint meeting of Congress.
   The last foreigner without a government job to address Congress
was the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought as a general in the
American Revolution, and spoke to a joint meeting in 1824, said Ray
Smock, the House historian.
   Walesa also will travel to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and
Caracas, Venezuela, before flying home.
   All the official hoopla may seem to be old hat for a man who won
the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1983, but Walesa said on the eve of
his visit he was worried about not having time to see all the
Americans who want to meet him.
   ``I cannot thank Americans enough, because it is physically
impossible,'' Walesa told The Associated Press in an interview last
week in Gdansk. ``Any trip to the states shorter than one month is
no good.''
   Uppermost in Walesa's mind was the survival of the Soldarity
government, headed by his former adviser, Tadeusz Mazowecki.
   To bolster that government, Walesa said, ``we need Columbuses
from the states ... to discover Poland, to clear the trail.''
   ``Then there will be an influx of millionaires, because there is
business to be done there,'' said Walesa, describing a Poland in
need of rebuilding from top to bottom.
   U.S. aid is forthcoming, but it may not be as much as Walesa
would like. House and Senate negotiators a week ago completed work
on a compromise to send $533 million in fiscal 1990 to Poland and
Hungary, including a $200 million U.S. contribution to a $1 billion
international aid fund to help stabilize the Polish currency, as
well as money for a $45 million program to promote private
enterprise in Poland.
   Additionally, a team from the International Monetary Fund was in
Poland last week reviewing the reform program proposed by
Solidarity. High marks from IMF could open the way for new credits,
as well as a rescheduling of Poland's $40 billion foreign debt.
   Bush has nothing new for Walesa, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III told reporters last Wednesday, but will reiterate the
support he expressed during a visit to Poland last July.
   Bush has proposed a $450 million aid package to Poland, low
enough to draw accusations of ``timidity'' from Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The amount proposed by Bush may not be enough, Baker
acknowledged. If not, ``you have to take another look at it at that
time. But the debate is not about policy approach, it's only about
the amount of money,'' he said.
   Bush responded to critics at a news conference last Tuesday,
saying ``I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than
triple the spending on every initiative ... I don't hear complaints
coming out of our allies or indeed out of Hungary or Poland or
Eastern Europe.''
   He is not likely to hear public complaints from Walesa, either,
predicted Janusz Bugajski, an analyst at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington.
   ``Poles understand that America is not going to write them a
blank check,'' said Bugajski. ``But they want the psychological
boost of having an American president say he suports them.''

Niagara Mohawk Power's Prospects Seem Dim
To Some Because of Its Stake in Nuclear Plant

   Few companies have put their shareholders through the wringer as much as Niagara Mohawk Power has recently.

   Last month, the Syracuse, N.Y.-based utility slashed its dividend 42%, to $1.20 a share annually, and took a $755 million write-off of nuclear-plant costs that regulators won't let it charge ratepayers.
Then the utility reported a $569.4 million loss for the first half, compared with profit of $238.3 million a year earlier.

   Niagara Mohawk's stock price has rebounded a bit in the market's latest surge, with some investors believing that all the bad news is finally out and the utility is on the road to financial recovery.
However, some analysts warn that things could get even worse.

   "It isn't like the uncertainty (surrounding Niagara Mohawk) has moved into the background," says Robin M. Jaffe, a utility analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

   Niagara Mohawk's major problem remains the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant.
Niagara Mohawk has a 41% stake in the plant, which is completed and licensed but not yet in commercial operation.
Meanwhile, the New York Public Service Commission has put a $4.16 billion cap on how much of the plant's costs can be passed on to ratepayers by Niagara Mohawk and the plant's four other utility owners.
The write-off Niagara Mohawk took last month fully reflects the utility's financial damage from that cap agreement if the plant goes into commercial operation in January, as the company expects.

   That is a big if, says James K. Asselstine, a utility bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. Mr. Asselstine, who recently came to Wall Street after serving on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, doubts that Nine Mile 2 will have a smooth start-up, given the problems the utility has had testing the plant's hardware, especially certain safety-critical valves.

   "It took (Niagara Mohawk) a long time to deal with those (hardware) problems," says Mr. Asselstine, who also is worried by the "deteriorating" operating performance of Niagara Mohawk at its Nine Mile Point 1 unit.

   Judith Warrick, a utility analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. says that if Nine Mile 2 encounters a lengthy delay beyond January, Niagara Mohawk may be forced to cut its dividend yet again.
The stock would be "fairly valued" at 13 1/2 to 14 a share, compared with its current price of 15 1/4, she says.

   Ms. Warrick also has concerns about Rochester Gas &amp; Electric and Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric, which have a 14% and a 9% stake in Nine Mile 2, respectively.
She believes there is a "fairly high possibility" both will have to trim dividends because of Nine Mile 2 costs.

   New York State Electric &amp; Gas, which has an 18% stake, also may have to trim dividends if it doesn't get the public service commission to approve its request for a 13% return on equity, Ms. Warrick says.

   Without Nine Mile 2, Niagara Mohawk would be a solid investment, analysts say.
While the utility's service territory in New York state isn't likely to experience much industrial growth in the next few years, Niagra Mohawk's power-production costs are reasonable, largely because of low-cost hydropower and nuclear power from Nine Mile 1.
And, like other utilities seeking new sources of revenue, Niagara Mohawk recently amended its charter to allow it to go into non-utility businesses.
However, it hasn't announced any specific plans to do so.

   Paul L. Gioia, a senior vice president at First Albany Corp. and a former chairman of the public service commission, recently issued a buy recommendation.
While he acknowledged some "lingering risk" because of Nine Mile 2, Mr. Gioia said Niagara Mohawk's financial condition "should consistently improve over the next several years."

   However, Daniel Scotto, a utility bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. sees other clouds on Niagara Mohawk's horizon.
Mr. Scotto thinks the current head of the commission, Peter Bradford, will push for statewide pooling of generating plants of all New York utilities.
Such a pooling, which would effectively place electricity distribution under state control, would presumably better match up supply with demand at the lowest possible price, resulting in significant savings for some ratepayers.

   Mr. Scotto says such an agreement also would mean that the relatively high-cost power from Nine Mile 2 probably would be sold at discount in the bulk-power market.
That would hurt all of Nine Mile 2's owners financially, Mr. Scotto says -- although he quickly adds that Mr. Bradford hasn't yet given any indication that he intends to push for such a pooling agreement.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
together tossed out the first balls Tuesday to begin the Toronto
Blue Jays' opening game against Bush's homestate Texas Rangers.
   The two smiled broadly as they threw the balls to a group of
ballplayers standing under the covered Skydome.
   Boos were mixed with applause as Bush and Mulroney came onto the
field and a huge banner reading ``Axe the Tax'' was plastered
across the bleachers. Mulroney's proposed 7 percent tax on goods
and services, passed Tuesday by the House of Commons, is widely
unpopular.
   Bush and Mulroney wore matching royal blue baseball jackets _
Mulroney's emblazoned with the Blue Jays' logo and Bush's with the
name of the Texas team partly owned by his son, George W. Bush.
   They later shed the jackets for their suit-and-tie outfits as
they sat in an upper-level VIP box overlooking the field. Bush, a
baseball fan and former captain of his Yale University team, ate
snacks as they watched the game.
   Before the game, Bush and Mulroney visited the locker rooms of
each team. In the Rangers' dressing room, Bush said he was cheering
for his son's team.
   ``Got to raise the flag,'' he said. Bush's adoptive home state
is Texas.
   Spotting a woman photographer in the Rangers' locker room, Bush
exclaimed: ``Ladies in the locker room! A new era!''
   The Blue Jays, the defending American League East champions,
drew a near-sellout crowd to the 51,000-seat stadium.
   The stadium officials provided visiting reporters with
``skyfacts'' about the venue Bush's entourage was visiting.
   Among them:
   _Eight miles of zippers hold down the baseball field's bright
green turf.
   _The facility's 1,280 toilets, if flushed simultaneously, would
use the amount of water that flows over Niagra Falls in three
seconds.
   _The amount of toilet paper used in its first year of operation
could reach to the moon.

<HEAD>House Panel Questions Kemp's Plan to Fight Urban Blight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's plan to fight
urban poverty with economic enterprise zones ran into skeptics
Tuesday in the House Ways and Means Committee, where Democrats
questioned the cost and said big new tax breaks would benefit the
wealthy.
   ``I think we have to be persuaded by more than your
enthusiasm,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., told Kemp as the secretary
made his familiar pitch for enterprise zones. ``I'm not convinced
the ... enthusiasm makes much sense.''
   ``I hope there's more here than just enthusiasm,'' responded
Kemp. ``I didn't come here to be a cheerleader.''
   Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, appeared
before the tax-writing committee to push the administration's plan
for a program of tax incentives aimed at attracting new business
investment to designated areas of economic blight.
   The administration's proposal _ also sponsored with Democratic
Rep. Charles Rangel of New York _ would start with 50 such zones
phased in over four years. In an effort to win the support of
rural-district legislators such as Dorgan, its sponsors have
provided for a portion of the zones to be designated for depressed
rural areas.
   The proposal would eliminate the capital gains tax on tangible
assets within the zones, provide investors with a $50,000 per year
tax deduction for new equity investment and provide an income tax
credit for low-income wage-earners.
   Kemp has frequently boosted the plan in appearances before
Congress, as it is a centerpiece of his plan to use private
enterprise to fight poverty. On Tuesday, he told the panel it
represented not ``trickle-down'' economics but ``a Niagra Falls''
of economic growth.
   Kemp estimated the cost at $1 billion over four years. Rep. J.J.
Pickle, D-Texas, said the total cost when more zones are added
could be much higher, and said Congress has ``apprehension and fear
... that once this starts, the cost will go out of bounds.''
   ``The cost is the thing we've got to face,'' Pickle said.
``Otherwise, the committee is going to have reservations.''
   Kemp said the cost would ``not get out of bounds.''
   Kemp's plan won support from many Republican members, but Rep.
Don Pease, D-Ohio, charged the program would ``generate enormous
tax benefits for the wealthy.''
   ``Why do we have to help poor people by first helping wealthy
people?'' he said.
   Kemp said the tax breaks would benefit investors but that their
money, invested in the zones, would provide jobs and opportunity
for the poor. ``I want to give other people a chance to get rich,''
he said.
   Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., questioned how sponsors could
justify a program that would provide benefits to businesses on one
end of a street but not on the other.
   ``If you can prove to us this is a worthwhile project, I
certainly would join with my colleagues to initiate at least a
pilot program,'' Rostenkowski told Kemp.

FALLING FOR THE NIAGARA PENINSULA'S WINE ROUTE
</P>

NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Canada
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Add wine to the already numerous inducements for visiting this lakeside hamlet
on the Canadian side of the Niagara River's mouth in Ontario province.
</P>
<P>
The Niagara Peninsula has long produced wine from native grapes that, at best,
yield acceptable aperitif wines. But in little more than a decade, some small
wineries have taken root in this splendidly situated region whose climate is
moderated by Lake Ontario to the north and sheltered from cold continental
blasts by a prominent ridge, the Niagara Escarpment, to the south.
</P>
<P>
And the welcome mat is out to visitors who wend their way along the newly
posted, picturesque Wine Route to sample the new premium bottlings. Since last
year's harvest, these can now be labeled with their own Niagara Peninsula
designation, Canada's first wine appellation.
</P>
<P>
 Happily for tourists, the Wine Route also leads to a sampling of the region's
other pleasures. Prominent among these is Niagara-on-the-Lake, a town of barely
12,000 that offers tree-lined lanes, neatly maintained homes, a lake-side golf
course and comfortably appointed, reasonably priced country inns.
</P>
<P>
This bucolic understatement provides a welcome contrast to the garish city of
Niagara Falls, about a dozen miles upstream. Yet the town's Queen Street offers
just enough shops for browsing among woolens, antiques and porcelains, and a
clock tower separating traffic in front of the 18th-Century courthouse that, in
1792, served briefly as Capitol of Upper Canada, now Ontario province.
</P>
<P>
As it approaches the river, the Wine Route passes in front of the contemporary
wood-and-glass theater that is home to Niagara-on-the-Lake's annual George
Bernard Shaw Festival, which runs from Easter to mid-October, then skirts Ft.
George (named for one of the English kings) a key British bastion in the War of
1812. America's counterpart, Ft. Niagara, is visible across the river's mouth
in New York.
</P>
<P>
At the broad river, the Wine Route joins Niagara Falls Parkway and an adjacent
bike path that meanders along the steep, forested banks before breaking west to
crisscross orchards and vineyards on its way to complete the loop at historic
Welland Canal. The canal's locks enable freighters to bypass Niagara Falls and
find safe passage between Lakes Erie and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
For anyone who recalls Napa Valley, or for that matter Sonoma, before wine and
wine tourism became big business, Niagara-on-the-Lake represents a welcome step
backward. On this peninsula, which encompasses a dozen municipalities, about as
many wineries have begun to offer samples of their production.
</P>
<P>
In terms of quality and California prices, the region provides some interesting
bargains, including a Pinot noir from Pelee Island in Lake Erie, Canada's
southernmost point, which retailed at Ontario's government-controled retail
store in Niagara-on-the-Lake for about $7.
</P>
<P>
This new premium-wine industry traces its brief life to the day in 1973 when a
young local vineyard supplier named Donald Ziraldo found himself defending the
foxy-sweet wines produced from native Niagara grape varieties against the
outspoken criticism of a customer, Karl Kaiser, a recent emigrant from Austria.
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's response to the mediocre wine he had found in his adopted country was
to make his own, and he eventually uncorked a bottle of dry rose to show what
could be done under the peninsula's microclimate.
</P>
<P>
Ziraldo recalled his amazement. "You made this from those?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
That tasting was to lead to the formation of Inniskillin Wines (in memory of an
Irish military unit that fought on the peninsula during the War of 1812). The
goal was to stay small and produce only fine wines. Today these include such
Burgundian varieties as Pinot noir and Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewurtztraminer
worthy of Alsace, as well as rarely encountered wines from French-developed
hybrids that sport such unfamiliar names as Marechal Foch, Baco Noir and Vidal.
</P>
<P>
Inniskillin produced 112,000 cases of mostly premium wine last year, though no
more than 1,000 cases found their way into this country. But Inniskillin, which
now owns prize Napa Valley vineyards at Rutherford, intends to begin changing
that.
</P>
<P>
Along with neighboring wineries, including Reif, German-owned Hillebrand and
Chateau des Charmes, supported by the provincial government, the Canadians last
month made their first marketing foray into New York -- which one importer
characterized as "the epicenter of the wine world."
</P>
<P>
But for now these wines remain a largely local secret, but it is one that the
wineries are eager to make better known. Thus, most offer free tours and
samples at little or no charge. Their warm, personalized reception contrasts
with the increasingly impersonal experience one encounters in Napa Valley,
where wine makers find themselves overrun by tourists and tour buses (even a
new Wine Train), and where demand for tourist facilities and housing competes
with demand for vineyards.
</P>
<P>
Lodging is available all year at Niagara-on-the-Lake and along the lake to the
west in bustling St. Catharines. Rooms fill fast each year during the Shaw
Festival and on holidays, but help is available, toll-free, from the Ontario
Ministry of Tourism and Recreation. Call toll-free (800) 268-3735.
</P>
<P>
The area has a wide selection of reasonably priced lodging. The top of the line
is represented by the Prince of Wales, where winter rates run from $94 for a
single to $200 for a suite.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the lake-front golf course is the Oban Inn, the 19th-Century
residence of a shoe manufacturer, where rates range from $70 to $150 and
afternoon tea is available on a glass-enclosed terrace.
</P>
<P>
A best buy, just down Picton Street from the Prince of Wales, is the Moffat
Inn, established as a hostelry in 1835. It offers antique-appointed rooms from
$49 to $90 in winter and from $75 to $95 next summer.

<TEXT>
   Merchants along the country's
northern border are floating on a tide of Canadian dollars,
watching sales figures swell at a time when shopping elsewhere in
the United States is slumping.
   Canadians have been traveling by car and bus from as far as 100
miles away this year to snap up goods that sell in the United
States for as low as half their cost back home.
   As a result, stores all along the border that reported record
sales last year - when retailing nationwide was stagnant - say
business is even better this Christmas.
   Bob Bowen, merchandising manager of a Kmart Corp. store outside
Niagara Falls, N.Y., said sales were up 15 percent over last year.
``And last year was a banner year, too,'' he said.
   Down the road, stores at the Factory Outlet Mall have been
reporting sales increases of anywhere from 5 percent to more than
10 percent over last year, said Pat Doyle, the mall's marketing
manager. She said up to 90 percent of the mall's customers are
Canadian.
   Parking lots at the Kmart and the mall were filled Wednesday
with cars bearing Ontario license plates, and chartered buses from
Canada were parked at the front.
   But seven miles away, at a Kmart in Niagara Falls, Ontario, only
three cashiers were on duty and the store was noticeably quiet.
   ``You Buffalo people are killing us,'' said merchandising
manager Dan Gimpel. ``There's not a heck of a lot we can do. People
are convinced there's bargains over there and they go over.''
   Richard Delisle, assistant district manager of Canada Customs in
Niagara Falls, Ontario, said the number of people paying duties on
goods purchased in the United States between April and October, the
most recent figures available, jumped 75 percent from last year's
record high.
   ``Each year we're looking at increases to unprecedented
levels,'' Delisle said.
   The story is the same in border towns across the country. In
Bellingham, Wash., 45 miles south of Vancouver, business at the
Bellis Fair Mall is up slightly thanks to the Canadians, said
marketing director Wendy Ripley.
   ``People are always amazed to see our parking lot and all the
Canadian cars in it,'' she said.
   In northern New York, motels are full of shoppers from as far
away as Ottawa and Montreal, and three-hour delays have been
reported on the international bridges.
   A recent study estimated that Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario,
businesses lose $140 million a year in sales to stores in much
smaller Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. The study, by Ernst &amp; Young in
Toronto, estimated the loss nationwide at $2 billion.
   Shopping by Canadians has surged even though Canada officially
is in a recession. Bern Rotman, spokesman for the New York State
Department of Economic Development, said the hard times in Canada
might actually spur more cross-border shopping.
   ``As the expendible income gets smaller in Canada - if that's
the case - it may very well be that the bargain that's had in the
United States is even more a siren song,'' he said.
   The price differences on many everyday items are staggering. An
eight-pack of batteries, for example, costs $3.97 in the United
States but $6.85 in Canada. A roll of color slide film that would
be less than $10 in New York is $14.59 in Ontario. Canadians pay
the equivalent of $2.16 a gallon for self-serve unleaded gas, while
those in Buffalo pay $1.43.
   ``A Canadian Kmart could probably come over here and buy power
tools cheaper off my counter than they could from their distributor
in Canada,'' said Thomas Reddy, general manager of the Niagara
Falls, N.Y., Kmart.
   Pam Clarkin said she drives 65 miles round-trip from her home in
Grassie, Ontario, to do her weekly grocery shopping in Niagara
Falls.
   ``Usually at home I pay about $120'' for a week's worth of
groceries, Clarkin said. ``Here I can get it for about $70.''
   Brian Kellett, a 19-year-old student at the University of
Toronto, said his fellow students make the 90-mile drive to Niagara
Falls as often as every two weeks to stock up on cheap booze and
cigarettes.
   ``Everybody comes down, they buy like a big jug of schnapps or
something,'' he said.
   Last year, Niagara Falls, N.Y., residents grumbled about the
traffic and litter problems they blamed on the Canadians. Merchants
said they had heard fewer complaints this year and speculated that
American shoppers have simply learned to put up with the crowds.
   ``They stay off the roads or go to Amherst (15 miles south)
where it's not so bad,'' said Bill Hench, manager of a Wallet Works
store at the outlet mall.

<P>
Canadian shoppers have made this holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but
some residents are feeling a lack of good will toward fellow shoppers from
across the border.
</P>
<P>
Low U.S. prices and a comparatively strong Canadian dollar have caused
Canadians to throng grocery stores, liquor marts and factory outlets throughout
this border city.
</P>
<P>
"The prices -- check it out," said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove 100 miles from
Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet Mall one recent Saturday.
Outside, in an overflowing parking lot, Ontario plates outnumbered New York
plates more than three to one.
</P>
<P>
The crowded lots, long checkout lines and delays entering Canada on the area's
three international bridges have caused tempers to rise at times.
</P>
<P>
A group of six Niagara Falls residents announced recently that they were
forming a group called "People Against Canadian Shoppers" to press local
merchants to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing against them (Canadians) personally, but we do think something
could be done to improve the situation for everyone," Steve Hughes, a spokesman
for the group, told the Niagara Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming Canadians for everything
from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting gasoline across the border in
extra tanks.
</P>
<P>
That effort, in turn, has prompted U.S. business and tourism officials to
hasten to assure Canadians that they are still welcome.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that there's a major war
going on," said Ray Wigle, spokesman for the Niagara Falls Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The convention and visitors bureau and the Niagara Falls Area Chamber of
Commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and expand checkouts.
Local governments have been asked to increase traffic control in order to
reduce the complaints.
</P>
<P>
Local Canada Customs officials have asked the agency that operates the
international bridges to expand the customs facilities and are trying to
persuade Ottawa to allocate more staff.
</P>
<P>
Same-day shopping traffic across the Rainbow and Whirlpool bridges has
increased by almost 60% over the past four years, and at the Lewiston-Queenston
bridge, the main route to major Canadian cities such as Hamilton and Toronto,
traffic is up 107% over that period, said John Johnston, district manager for
Canada Customs operations in Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
Theories abound as to why the number of shoppers has multiplied, though the
year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact isn't considered a direct cause. The
agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on several categories of merchandise
but has not yet affected the duties paid by individual shoppers at the border.
</P>
<P>
Still, free trade may have subtly boosted cross-border shopping by helping to
strengthen the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar trades at about 85 U.S.

   Canadian shoppers have made this
holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but some residents are
feeling a lack of goodwill toward fellow shoppers from across the
border.
   Low U.S. prices and a comparatively strong Canadian dollar have
caused Canadians to throng grocery stores, liquor marts and factory
outlets throughout this border city.
   ``The prices _ check it out,'' said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove
100 miles from Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet
Mall one recent Saturday. Outside, in an overflowing parking lot,
Ontario plates outnumbered New York plates more than three to one.
   The crowded lots, long checkout lines and delays entering Canada
on the area's three international bridges have caused tempers to
rise at times.
   A group of six Niagara Falls residents announced recently they
were forming a group called ``People Against Canadian Shoppers'' to
press local merchants to deal with the problems.
   ``We have nothing against them (Canadians) personally, but we do
think something could be done to improve the situation for
everyone,'' Steve Hughes, a spokesman for the group, told The
Niagara Gazette.
   Hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming Canadians
for everything from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting
gasoline across the border in extra tanks.
   That effort, in turn, has prompted U.S. business and tourism
officials to hasten to assure Canadians that they are still welcome.
   ``It's easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that
there's a major war going on,'' said Ray Wigle, spokesman for the
Niagara Falls Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   The convention and visitors bureau and the Niagara Falls Area
Chamber of Commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and
expand checkouts. Local governments have been asked to increase
traffic control in order to reduce the complaints.
   Local Canada Customs officials have asked the agency that
operates the international bridges to expand the customs facilities
and are trying to persuade Ottawa to allocate more staff.
   Same-day shopping traffic across the Rainbow and Whirlpool
bridges has increased by almost 60 percent over the past four
years, and at the Lewiston-Queenston bridge, the main route to
major Canadian cities such as Hamilton and Toronto, traffic is up
107 percent over that period, said John Johnston, district manager
for Canada Customs operations in Niagara Falls.
   Theories abound over why the number of shoppers has multiplied,
though the year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact isn't considered a
direct cause. The agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on
several categories of merchandise but has not yet affected the
duties paid by individual shoppers at the border.
   Still, free trade may have subtly boosted cross-border shopping
by helping to strengthen the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar
trades at about 85 U.S. cents these days after falling as low as 70
cents earlier in the decade.
   Niagara Falls, N.Y., also has a built-in price advantage because
western New York is one of the cheaper regions of the United States
while Niagara Falls, Ontario, is an extension of the pricey Toronto
metropolitan area, said Wigle.
   Price is not the only attraction of the United States, some
Canadian shoppers said.
   ``In groceries, anything new they come out with (in the U.S.) is
in Canada the year after,'' said Lisa Morrice of Hamilton, Ontario.
   ``You just don't have the choices (in Canada),'' agreed a
Toronto woman who declined to give her name. ``You see different
things down here.''
   U.S. grocery chains began advertising heavily across the border
in the past few months after seeing the stronger dollar and the
increased willingness of Canadians to cross the bridges.
   ``Their money is worth a lot more than it was two years ago,''
said Ralph Meranto, manager of a local Tops supermarket. ``It
wasn't even worthwhile before.''
   Canadian merchants say they can't compete with U.S. prices, but
are not calling for stronger government action to protect them.
   Turkeys that cost 69 cents a pound in the United States sell for
the equivalent of $1.28 to $1.49 a pound in Canada, said Justin
Sauve, manager of Hy and Zel's Supermarket in Niagara Falls,
Ontario.
   ``A lot of people I know buy a case of beer for 10 bucks (in the
U.S.) and over here it's $22 or $23,'' Sauve said. ``People go over
there to gas up and they go to the stores while they're there.''
   Canada, unlike the United States, has no duty-free allowance for
shoppers who have been out of the country less than 24 hours. Sauve
said a lot of Canadians are escaping the duty and federal sales
tax, which can add up to 19.8 percent to the cost of a purchase,
but declined to fault customs officials for letting them through.
   ``If you take everybody who you could pull over, you'd be
pulling everybody over,'' he said. ``You'd be there all day pulling
them over.''
   Johnston, the customs manager, said his agency's penetration
rate was ``reasonable'' given the need to keep traffic flowing.
   ``When we have to take enforcement action, it tends to slow
things down,'' he said.

   Carlos Fajardo took his family
across the Rainbow Bridge into Canada and lost the pot of gold that
had been their lives in the United States.
   Fajardo, who struggled for 20 years to leave his native Cuba,
accidentally deported himself and his family by crossing the border
on a 20-minute sightseeing trip Dec. 23.
   Even though the family lived in the United States for four years,
federal immigration officials will not allow them back because they
are illegal aliens.
   They are stranded in a motel in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
   ``We came for 20 minutes,'' Fajardo said. ``No one told us we
could not go back.''
   Fajardo, 39, a small, soft-spoken man, said the ordeal began Dec.
20, when they set out from their home in Miami on a Christmas quest
to find snow, which his adopted children, Yoandys, 12, and Yordalys,
9, had never seen.
   As he spoke Tuesday, his wife and children sat watching
television in their small motel room. He would occassionally turn to
the boy, Yoandys, to help him answer in English.
   Fajardo said the quest brought them 1,500 miles in their truck to
Niagara Falls, N.Y., where they checked into a motel and planned to
visit Canada. He told Canadian border guards his family wanted to
see the Horseshoe Falls.
   When they returned, however, U.S. border guards demanded to see
proof of their citizenship. All Fajardo had was a Florida driver's
license.
   At first, Fajardo maintained that he was a U.S. citizen. Later he
said he was a resident alien. But immigration officials, after a
search of their records, determined otherwise.
   Benedict Ferro, director of the federal Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in Buffalo, said Fajardo's wife,
Bermaida, and her two children entered the United States illegally
in 1985 and that Fajardo entered the country illegally in 1986.
   Fajardo denies entering the country illegally.
   An immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to Mrs. Fajardo and
the two children. She appealed the decision in August on grounds
that she would face persecution if returned to Cuba, but her appeal
was rejected.
   Fajardo's application for asylum was pending when he crossed the
border. His status was officially nullified by leaving the country,
Ferro said.
   Fajardo could reapply, but his wife and children cannot because
they previously provided fraudulent information to immigration
officials, Ferro said.
   ``The family lied and their credibility is about zero at this
point,'' Ferro said.
   Canadian authorities have given the family permission to stay in
Canada until Sunday. What happens to them after that is uncertain.
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., urged immigration officials to
allow the family to return to Florida for humanitarian reasons.
   ``This family has strong ties to the Miami community through
relatives, business and local school attendence,'' Graham said in a
letter Tuesday to INS officials. ``It would be comforting to these
people for them to be able to resume their well-established lives.''
   Under terms of a bond he posted in order to leave Cuba, Fajardo
agreed not to return to his homeland. He said he left the country in
1984 with only the clothes on his back.
   He achieved relative prosperity in the United States working a
number of jobs, including his current one as a boat builder, and
said he owns a home in Miami.
   It has been nearly three weeks since the family checked into the
motel in Ontario, and they've seen more than enough snow.
   ``We are all very tired,'' he said. ``The children are missing
school ... We want to go home.''
   Now the family is running low on money, said sister Margaret
Quinn of Fort Erie, Ontario, who has been providing assistance
through the Niagara Refugee Committee.
   Sister Quinn has urged American and Canadian immigration
officials to allow the stranded family to return to the care of
their relatives in Miami, but says the case seems to be closed.
   ``It's really contrary to the whole spirit of international law
and relations to have them walking about without a country,'' she
said. ``This whole thing is really a mess.''

<HEAD>Polish Solidarity Leader Visits Niagara Falls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa put aside his appeals
for foreign investment in Poland on Saturday to visit Niagara
Falls, where for a time the Solidarity leader became another
tourist attraction.
   In a steady rain and gusting winds, Walesa was surrounded by
about 100 people trying to get a glimpse of the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate as he arrived.
   ``He's my hero,'' said Mario Guatieri, a 50-year-old steelworker
from this Ontario city. ``I admire him for his courage.''
   Walesa, 46, on the second day of a four-day Canadian trip, is
trying to encourage investment to support the democratic and
capitalist reforms the Solidarity-led government introduced since
replacing the communist regime in September. He flies to Washington
Monday.
   After a meeting with Niagara Falls Mayor Bill Smeaton, Walesa
said he doesn't want to run for political office in Poland despite
calls for the trade union leader to do so.
   ``I prefer to be a small boss,'' he said in Polish, one of the
few times he spoke publicly.
   Walesa met a group of business executives Saturday at a private
luncheon in Toronto before he flew by helicopter to Niagara Falls.
He later said time will tell whether his trip to Canada and the
United States is successful at attracting investment to Poland.
   ``Businessmen are very careful,'' he told reporters through a
translator. ``They received us well, but we will have to wait for
them.''
   Poland's economy is burdened by a $40 billion foreign debt,
inflation approaching 300 percent a year and low productivity in
its factories.
   Flanked by security guards, Walesa waded through the crowd to
get a quick look at the Falls.
   Some sightseers managed to get close enough to shake Walesa's
hand, while others gave him mementoes, including postcards and a
gray cap bearing the Niagara Parks Commission's green logo of a
tree.
   On Sunday, Walesa takes part in a labor rally at Hamilton's
Copps Coliseum and attends a function sponsored by the Canadian
Polish Congress at Toronto's Massey Hall commemorating Polish
Independence Day.
   He meets Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in Ottawa Monday before
flying to Washington. He is also scheduled to visit Philadelphia,
Chicago and New York this week.

   A Cuban family from Florida stranded in
Canada since a pre-Christmas sightseeing trip because of
immigration problems reportedly may soon be allowed to return home.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service District Director
Benedict J. Ferro will approve Carlos Fajardo's bid for political
asylum within the next few weeks, ending the family's exile in Fort
Erie, Ontario, The Buffalo News reported today.
   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two children
have lived on charity since Dec. 23, when they were denied re-entry
into the United States at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls.
   The couple, both considered illegal aliens, told border
authorities that they had driven north to see snow for Christmas
and had crossed the border into Canada to view Niagara Falls.
   Fajardo owns a home and a small boat-building business in Miami.
Officials have alleged he entered the United States illegally in
1985 from Panama. His wife and her children by a previous marriage
allegedly entered the country illegally in 1986 from Venezuela and
an immigration judge ordered them deported last August.
   Ferro would not discuss the case in detail but confirmed that
new information could substantiate Fajardo's claims that he would
face political persecution if he were returned to his native Cuba.
   ``Mr. Fajardo's claim is clearly not frivolous,'' Ferro said
told the News. ``If indeed it proves to rise to the level of a
well-founded fear of being persecuted if returned to Cuba, we will
grant him asylum.''
   ``It looks like we may be able to work something out,'' said
Sister Kathleen Rimar, Fajardo's Catholic Charities attorney in
Buffalo.
   After they were denied re-entry, the Fajardos lived for several
weeks in a motel in Niagara Falls, Ontario, then in a Fort Erie
apartment under the sponsorship of Ontario refugee groups.
   Fajardo had a previous application for asylum pending, but it
was nullified when he crossed the border into Canada, officials
said.

   Workers formed a human chain and
waded into the Niagara River rapids to rescue four people who clung
to rocks 40 feet above the falls for about an hour after their boat
capsized, authorities said.
   The four began drinking on the 26-foot boat Wednesday evening at
a marina in Chippawa, Ontario, and were unaware they had drifted so
close to Horseshoe Falls, the celebrated 158-foot drop on the
Canadian side of the border, authorities said.
   No one was steering, said Sgt. James Dugos of the Niagara
Regional State Parks Police. ``I'm very much surprised that all
four people were saved,'' he said.
   The four abandoned the boat when it capsized 40 yards from the
brink of the falls and were rescued early Thursday, suffering only
bumps and scrapes. The $130,000 boat was swept over the falls and
destroyed.
   David Shand, 34, said he thought he and his companions would die
as they clasped the rocks with the roar of the falls in their ears.
   ``You had to be out there,'' said the owner of the boat, David
Mason, 35. ``It's like something you dream about in the middle of
the night.''
   A camper in Goat Island State Park heard the four screaming and
called for help.
   Warning signs and the rapids of the upper Niagara River usually
discourage boaters from getting too close to the falls.
   No charges have been filed against the four, all residents of
Niagara Falls, Ontario.

   Truck traffic resumed across the
Canadian-U.S. border after Canada's transport minister persuaded
drivers to end their blockade, and automakers began reopening
plants shut by parts shortages.
   Chrysler Corp. recalled 3,200 workers to its Windsor minivan
plant today after independent Canadian truckers lifted a blockade
of the Ambassador Bridge, a major supply route for U.S.-made auto
parts.
   ``The situation is looking better by the hour,'' said Chrysler
Canada spokesman Walter McCall. ``The flow of materials has been
restored and the likelihood is good that workers will be on their
full shifts (today).''
   But truckers at some other southern Ontario border points,
including Fort Erie across the Niagara River from Buffalo, N.Y.,
and Niagara Falls, remained snarled late Thursday.
   Trucks still were blocking a lane of the Lewiston-Queenston
Bridge at Niagara Falls, allowing only cars to pass, state police
said.
   Trucks were not being allowed across the Peace Bridge linking
Buffalo and Fort Erie, and about 100 to 200 trucks were parked on
each side of the span, bridge officials said.
   In Windsor, the blockade of 300 trucks strangled traffic
Wednesday and part of Thursday on the span between Windsor and
Detroit but gave way to a steady stream of trucks moving in a
single lane by Thursday evening.
   The work stoppage was lifted after Canadian Transport Minister
Doug Lewis said he would take up with the Cabinet the truckers'
complaints about taxes and the free-trade agreement with the United
States.
   ``I am pleased to have had the opportunity to learn directly
from them their concerns about what they consider to be an unlevel
playing field,'' he said.
   Lewis met Thursday morning in Windsor with a delegation led by
Wayne Whitney, a protest organizer, and Bill Wrye, Ontario minister
of transportation.
   About 5 p.m. Thursday, the crowd of protesters dispersed,
apparently pleased with the agreement, said Windsor police Staff
Sgt. R. Nichols.
   ``There were about 200 people and another 100 to 150 trucks
there. But the truckers were happy, got into their trucks and drove
away,'' Nichols said.
   A sign thanking U.S. truckers for their support during the
blockade hung at an intersection where truckers had congregated
during the strike.
   The protest was sparked by proposed increases in Canada's Goods
and Services Tax that will affect the goods that truckers haul as
well as the tires, insurance and diesel fuel they buy.
   The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove almost all
tariffs by 1999, will further handicap Canadian truckers,
protesters said.
   The truckers said taxes and the free-trade agreement are
crippling their ability to compete with U.S. drivers.
   The blockade also forced the shutdown of three General Motors of
Canada Ltd. plants in Ontario and production cutbacks at one in
Quebec. Some 13,000 auto workers were affected. Production also was
disrupted at Ford of Canada.
   Ford plants closed early Thursday in Dearborn and Wayne, Mich.;
Lorain and Avon, Ohio; Louisville; and Minneapolis, said company
spokesman Peter Olsen.
   At Mazda Motor Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., 20 miles south
of Detroit, workers went home early Wednesday and Thursday, said
spokesman Tom McDonald.
   Protesters also had blocked the truck lanes at the Canadian end
of the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron, Mich.,
while in Sault Ste. Marie, supervisor Jim Blain at the
International Bridge said he received conflicting reports about the
work stoppage.
   At Fort Erie, about 200 trucks jammed the approaches to the
international Peace Bridge to Buffalo, N.Y. At Blackpool, Quebec,
just across the border from Champlain, N.Y., a heavily armed squad
of police persuaded Quebec truckers to dismantle their blockade
Thursday morning.
   No violence was reported at any of the blockaded border points.

   Independent Canadian truckers ended
their three-day strike Thursday afternoon after transportation
officials in Canada promised to address their complaints about
taxes, authorities said.
   ``The blockade ended about a half hour ago,'' said Staff Sgt. R.
Nichols of the police department in Windsor, adjacent to Detroit.
It was one of a number of border cities where blockades had choked
off U.S.-Canadian commerce.
   ``There were about 200 people and another 100 to 150 trucks
there. But the truckers were happy, got into their trucks and drove
away,'' Nichols said.
   But truckers at some other southern Ontario border points,
including Fort Erie across the Niagara River from Buffalo, N.Y.,

and the free-trade agreement with the United States.
   ``I am pleased to have had the opportunity to learn directly

   The protest was sparked by proposed increases in Canada's goods
and services tax that will affect everything from the goods that

   The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove almost all

protesters said. The truckers contended that taxes and the
free-trade agreement are crippling their ability to compete with
U.S. drivers.
   The blockade dried up the flow of U.S.-made auto parts to
Canada, forcing the shutdown of three General Motors of Canada Ltd.
plants in Ontario and production cutbacks at one in Quebec. Some
13,000 auto workers were affected. Production also was disrupted at
Chrysler Canada and Ford of Canada.
   Ford plants also closed in Dearborn, Mich.; Wayne, Mich.;
Lorain, Ohio; Avon, Ohio; Louisville, Ky. and Minneapolis, said
company spokesman Peter Olsen.
   ``How and when things will be back to normal really depends on
the flow of auto parts,'' he said. Spokesman for the other
automakers didn't return calls to their homes Thursday evening.
   At Mazda Motor Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., 20 miles south
of Detroit, afternoon-shift workers were sent home four hours early
Wednesday afternoon.
   Day-shift employees were sent home two hours early Thursday, and
the entire plant was expected to close Friday, spokesman Tom
McDonald said. The plant gets windshields, brakes and other
components from Canadian suppliers.
   Lewis met Thursday morning in Windsor with a delegation led by
protest organizer Wayne Whitney and Bill Wrye, Ontario minister of
transportation.
   Whitney, Wrye and Tom Baldwin, president of Teamsters Local 880
in Windsor, spoke later in the morning to about 200 truckers
milling near the foot of the bridge. The negotiators drew shouts,
catcalls and curses after saying Lewis could promise only to relay
their concerns to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his Cabinet.
   ``We want answers right now!'' bellowed a voice from the crowd.
``We haven't been here two days for nothing. We'll be here another
week if we have to.''
   ``You can't get laws changed in two hours,'' Baldwin pleaded.
``You can't consider them false promises.''
   Protesters earlier blocked the truck lanes at the Canadian end
of the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron, Mich., said
Morris Hall of the Michigan Department of Transportation.
   Automobile traffic in Port Huron and on the Ambassador Bridge
was moving freely all day Thursday. Authorities at both bridges
refused to let trucks enter Canada because of the likelihood they
would be blockaded and hinder other traffic, Hall said.
   No violence was reported at any of the blockaded border points.

A Canadian has been arrested for the second time this month on charges of
attempting to perform a stunt at Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
Peter E. DeBernardi, 43, was arrested Tuesday near the base of the Horseshoe
Falls in Ontario and charged with criminal trespass and attempting to perform a
stunt on park property, said a Niagara parks police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Police would not elaborate on DeBernardi's planned stunt. The Buffalo News,
quoting unidentified sources, said DeBernardi had a length of rope with him and
speculated that he might have planned to try repeating a 1988 stunt in which he
rappelled into the gorge at the base of the falls.

<HEAD>High Taxes Drive Canadian Beer Buyers Across The Border</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Visitors to this border town shouldn't
be surprised if the cold Canadian beer their host offers them has
an ``imported'' stamp on it these days.
   An increasing number of Canadians who live near the U.S. border
have taken to buying their favorite brews in the United States,
where popular Canadian beers sell for as little as half the price
charged back home.
   The trend is seriously worrying the managers of beer outlets in
border towns such as Fort Erie, just across the Niagara River from
Buffalo, N.Y. They say they're hamstrung because of government
controls on price and marketing.
   ``We're not on a level playing field,'' said Gordon Reichett,
manager of the Fort Erie Beer Store. ``There's no way for us to do
anything about the marketing because we're limited by the (Ontario)
Liquor Control Board.''
   In Ontario, for example, beer may be sold only through Beer
Store outlets and provincial liquor stores, and prices, by law,
must be the same everywhere.
   That leaves border-area beer sellers unable to meet the
competition from New York supermarkets, which use beer as a loss
leader to lure customers.
   ``We use some beers ... as draws to get people into the
stores,'' said Mark Zee, manager of a Tops supermarket in Buffalo.
``We don't lose money on it but we don't make a lot either.''
   In Buffalo, Canadian brands such as Molson Golden or Labatt's
Blue cost about $12 a case, including tax, deposit and the
round-trip toll on the international Peace Bridge. The same beer
costs $19.65 a case at Beer Store outlets, which control 94 percent
of Ontario's beer trade.
   The price difference has existed for years, but merchants on
both sides of the border said Canadians only began shopping for
beer in the United States in large numbers about a year ago, when
the Canadian dollar strengthened against U.S. dollar and American
stores began advertising heavily in Canada.
   Reichett said business at his store is off 11 percent from last
year's pace.
   Sales would be even slower if it weren't for U.S. shoppers
seeking premium high-alcohol Canadian beers that are unavailable in
the United States. Those buyers now make up almost 25 percent of
his business, he says.
   ``The Fort Erie people are not buying the Molson Dry and the
Brador and the Extra Stock ales,'' Reichett said. ``It's the
American clientele, and thank God for them.''
   Canada Customs does not keep statistics on beer imports, but
inspectors at the Peace Bridge estimate that Canadian brands
account for about 30 percent of the beer that Canadians bring back
from the United States.
   Jan Westcott, executive director of the trade group Brewers of
Ontario, said the problem exists throughout the province's borders
with New York, Michigan and Minnesota. He said high alcohol taxes
are the culprit.
   ``If you take $10 worth of tax off and account a little for the
exchange rate, there's not that much difference in the price,'' he
said. ``We have a very aggressive tax policy with respect to
alcohol.''
   Even when you add in $6.80 a case in tax and duty collected by
Canada Customs at the border, it's cheaper to buy beer in New York.
And that's only if shoppers declare their beer. Some don't, and
many who do say they often are waved through without paying duty.
   ``They're pretty slack on the bridges these days, letting people
go back and forth with whatever they want,'' said Larry Shale,
manager of the Beer Store in Niagara Falls, He said business at his
store is off almost 20 percent in the past year.
   ``If they were stricter in controlling what goes over the
bridges, that would help us.''
   Customs officials say that's an exaggeration, but admit many
shoppers do get by without paying duty, especially on busy days.
   ``We get some days where the traffic's backed up across the
bridge,'' Stuart McLeod, a Canada Customs supervisor in Fort Erie.
``There's no way of collecting duty on every single case.''

<HEAD>U.S. Stuntman Missing After Going Over Niagara Falls in Kayak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. stuntman was missing Tuesday
after going over Niagara Falls in a kayak, Canadian police said.
   The red kayak was recovered below Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side, ``all in one piece ... in fairly good condition, all things
considered,'' said Maureen Quinn, a constable with the Niagara Parks
Police. But she said authorities ``found nothing else, just the
kayak. No body's been found.''
   The Canadian falls, the world's largest by volume, are 181 feet
high, or about as tall as a 13-story building.
   Another constable, Kim Davis, said the 28-year-old man from
Tennessee was trying to complete a stunt that had been planned for
about 10 years. Police said nobody has ever tried to kayak over the
Canadian side of the falls.
   ``Barrels, yes,'' said Quinn of other attempts to go over the
falls in enclosed capsules and live. But, she said, ``it doesn't
seem plausible he could do it (and survive).''
   George Bailey of the Niagara Parks Commission said the man had
attempted the stunt several years ago on the American side of the
falls, but park police stopped him.
   He said the man was accompanied by a film crew and a friend who
took photographs.
   Quinn said police received a call that the stuntman had entered
the water about a half-mile above the falls but ``by the time we
responded it was too late. ... (He) actually went over the brink.''
   She said ``several people saw him go over. It was videotaped.
There were plenty of witnesses.''
   The man, whose identity was not disclosed pending notification of
next of kin, was last seen at about 1:45 p.m. EDT, Quinn said.
   Ken Kitchen was working in an Ontario Hydro tower overlooking the
Niagara River when he saw a man stripped to the waist in a kayak.
   He said the utility closed the dam gates, reducing the water flow
to the falls in an attempt to stop him.
   The man's boat grounded, but he picked it up and moved it into
the middle of the river, Kitchen said.
   ``He was gone before our help could get there. All we could do
was sit and watch helplessly,'' Kitchen said.
   At a press conference later Tuesday, police showed reporters a
videotape a tourist made of the incident.
   The film shows a man in a kayak successfully negotiating the
rapids of the Niagara River just before the falls. Then, he
disappears.
   ``It's beyond me why anyone would attempt this,'' said George
Bailey of the Niagara Parks Commission. ``He obviously doesn't know
our falls.''
   Dave Munday, who went over the falls in a steel barrel three
years ago, said people who try such stunts are usually not aware of
the dangers of the falls.
   ``A lot of people underestimate what's at the bottom,'' he said.
``I did myself. It's just solid rock down there. People don't
realize that.''
   Bailey said 13 people have intentionally gone over the falls _
most in barrel-like structures. Ten of the 13 survived.

<HEAD>Canadian Pair Survive Trip Over Niagara Falls in a Barrel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men who became the eighth and
ninth persons to survive a ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel said
they did it to show kids there are better things to do than drugs.
   ``It felt like a roller coaster ride, falling straight down,''
Jeffrey Petkovich said afterward. ``But with a roller coaster ride,
you come to a minor stop. You feel it, but not as much as we did.''
   Petkovich, 25, of Ottawa, and Peter DeBernardi, 42, of Niagara
Falls, Ontario, rode a 10-foot metal container over the
176-foot-high Horseshoe Falls on Wednesday to become the first pair
ever to go over together in the same barrel.
   Three people did not survive the plunge.
   ``We wanted to show these kids there's a lot better things for
kids to do than be on the brink of dope,'' DeBernardi said.
   The two suffered ``very, very minor cuts and scrapes'' during
their ride, said Constable David Jahns of Niagara Parks Police.
   Jahns said DeBernardi and Petkovich entered the Niagara River
about 100 yards from the brink of Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side of the border at about 5:30 p.m. They were rescued at the
bottom by park police, but the barrel was still in the water and
was to be recovered today, he said.
   Both men were charged with unlawfully performing a stunt in the
park. DeBernardi, who had been saying for 18 months he would
perform the stunt, also was charged with engaging in a prohibitive
activity in the park, Jahns said.
   The men were released pending an Oct. 26 appearance in
Provincial Offenses Court in Niagara Falls, Jahns said.
   The metal barrel, lined with foam on the inside, was about 10
feet long and 4 to 5 feet high, Jahns said.
   ``Your chances are quite low on the 1-to-10 scale type of
things, no matter how high-tech your equipment is,'' he said.
   The last person to make the rough journey was John David Munday
of Caistor Center, Ontario, who went over on Oct. 5, 1985, and
survived.
   A month before Munday went over, Steven T. Trotter of
Barrington, R.I., successfully took the plunge. The previous year,
Karel Soucek of Hamilton, Ontario, also made a successful trip, but
he was killed six months later when he tried a similar barrel drop
at the Astrodome in Houston.
   The first daredevil to attempt the stunt was Annie Edson Taylor,
a Michigan school teacher. She survived the trip in 1901, although
she was badly injured.
   Those who have died going over the falls were George Stathakis
in 1930, Charles G. Stephens in 1930 and William ``Red'' Hill Jr.
in 1951.
   Only one person has ever survived the plunge outside a barrel.
Nine-year-old Roger Woodward was accidentally swept over the falls
in 1960. Although he was wearing only a life jacket, he was plucked
from the water unscratched.

   Canadian Pacific Ltd. and Conrail said
Monday they reached agreement on a disputed stretch of track
between Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y., clearing the way for CP to
buy the ailing Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway for $25 million.
   The announcement ends months of negotiations over the
Buffalo-Niagara Gateway, a 30-mile stretch vital to CP's plans of
using the D&amp;H system to connect the ports of Philadelphia and New
York with the Canadian interior.
   ``We expect to begin service through the Niagara Gateway in
about a week and to achieve final closing of the purchase within
the next few weeks,'' I.B. Scott, CP's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement.
   As part of the agreement, Consolidated Rail Corp. will withdraw
its request that the two sides go to arbitration to settle the
D&amp;H's operating rights between Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Conrail
had been blocking CP's access to the tracks, which the Canadian
railway needed to link with its own lines in southern Ontario.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad,
filed for bankruptcy in July 1988. A trustee was appointed by a
federal judge to oversee its operation.
   CP's $25 million offer for the D&amp;H was accepted last May. The
Canadian railroad took over operation of the D&amp;H in August, but the
Buffalo-Niagara Gateway dispute had put the deal on hold.

   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. said Wednesday
that rival Michael Dukakis showed foreign policy inexperience with
an ``unwise and irresponsible'' statement that he would reserve the
right to respond with nuclear force if the Soviets invaded Western
Europe.
   Gore said Dukakis had erred in ``saying that he would launch a
nuclear strike against the Soviet Union under ... specific
circumstances,'' but transcripts indicated the governor did not
make such a statement.
   Nonetheless, Gore accused the Massachusetts governor of
violating a long-held ``tenet of American foreign policy'' that
presidents and aspirants for that office do not spell out to the
Soviets or any other country how the United States would make use
of nuclear arsenals in response to agression.
   With New York's Democratic presidential primary one week away
and looming as crucial for his candidacy, the Tennessee senator
seized on comments attributed to Dukakis in an interview published
Wednesday in the New York Daily News.
   ``Governor Dukakis made a significant mistake in saying that he
would launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union under the
following specific circumstances,'' Gore said. ``That's unwise and
irresponsible, and it underscores ... that experience in foreign
policy is relevant.''
   Gore made his assault on Dukakis at a breakfast with business
and civic leaders on Long Island, and later with reporters.
   Dukakis' remarks were contained in a story in the newspaper
which quoted him as saying of the scenario of a Soviet attack on
Europe: ``Our present strategy in Europe assumes that if the
Soviets were to invade and conventional forces couldn't stop them,
we reserve the right to use nuclear force. I don't think that's
going to happen and in fact I see the opposite happening.''
   Gore also had criticism for rival Jesse Jackson, saying he had
displayed his lack of foreign policy experience with a remark
before the U.S.-Soviet agreement on intermediate nuclear weapons in
Europe was reached that he would unilaterally halt deployment. Gore
said the agreement would not have taken place had the United States
taken the position Jackson advocated.
   Gore also criticized Dukakis as ``a little murky'' on the
question of establishing an independent state for Palestinians, a
subject of campaign discussion in recent days as the battle for New
York's 255 delegates has focused on Middle East issues and the
concerns of the state's influential Jewish population.
   The Gore campaign, however, considered Dukakis' statement on a
nuclear response to be a major event in the New York campaign. San
Francisco fund-raiser and Gore adviser Duane B. Garrett said
Dukakis has shown he is ``error prone'' and compared the nuclear
statement to major gaffes of earlier campaigns: President Ford's
suggestion that Poland was not under Soviet influence and
Republican George Romney's remark that he had been brainwashed on
the issue of Vietnam.
   ``I see this as a major blunder of that caliber,'' said Garrett.
   Speaking to the breakfast group, Gore said neither of his
Democratic rivals had any foreign policy experience and, defending
his own statement, added: ``That's not a personal attack. It's just
fact.''
   He described the Dukakis interview as a ``fresh illustration.''
   ``One of my opponents said in an interview yesterday that he
would launch a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union if
they invaded'' Europe with conventional forces, Gore said in an
apparent misrepresentation of Dukakis' comments.
   ``It is a mistake. It is irresponsible to publicly state we'll
launch our missiles and trigger nuclear war under these
circumstances or those circumstances,'' Gore said. ``That's been
held in reserve and covered with uncertainty we want to exist in
the minds of our adversaries in this world _ for good reason.''
   Later, campaigning in Niagara Falls, N.Y., Gore stood by his
criticism of Dukakis and his characterization of Dukakis' remarks.
   ``I think it is most unwise for a president of the United States
or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a
hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces
and trigger the destruction of human civilization,'' he said.
   Asked if he would rule out the use of nuclear weapons, Gore
said, ``I will not be drawn into a hypothetical discussion. ...
Governor Dukakis made a serious mistake in allowing himself to be
drawn into that discussion and then in saying that he would launch
a first strike against the Soviet Union if they launched a
conventional war on Europe.''
   During an appearance Wednesday night in Westchester County, Gore
read from a transcript of the newspaper interview and said Dukakis
had been asked whether he could conceive of the first use of
``strategic'' weapons
   ``NATO has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,''
he said. ``The president of the United States has traditionally
refused to respond to that hypothetical.''
   Gore stood in front of the Love Canal hazardous waste site and
denounced the Reagan administration for what he said was a failure
to enforce environmental protection laws and a failure to see that
such sites are properly cleaned up.
   ``This administration's record on environmental protection is
disgraceful and Love Canal stands as a symbol of their
unwillingness to act,'' he said.
   As a House member, Gore chaired the first congressional hearings
into the dumping of hazardous wastes at the Love Canal site.

   Democratic presidential candidates set aside their differences
during a one hour-debate Saturday and concentrated their fire on
the Republican administration, criticizing President Reagan and
Vice President George Bush on issues ranging from the sale of arms
to Iran to the handling of the AIDS epidemic.
   ``I don't see any intensity out there for George Bush,'' said
Michael Dukakis, entering the final weekend of the New York
presidential primary as the front-runner in the polls.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said the administration had ``a disgraceful
record'' in its handling of AIDS.
   ``We cannot just manage Reaganomics, we're going to have to
reverse Reaganomics,'' Jesse Jackson said at the debate in
Rochester, N.Y.
   Before flying to the western New York city, Dukakis met with
black businessmen in Harlem and toured an Italian neighborhood in
Queens.
   Asked why he has spent so little time campaigning in black
neighborhoods, the Massachusetts governor said, ``I understand
Jesse's going to get the lion's share of the votes in this
community and that's understandable.''
   But, said Dukakis, he had ``always had good support in the black
community.''
   Jackson, in a campaign appearance in Niagara Falls, N.Y., urged
Indians, who generally do not vote as a matter of principle, to get
involved in the nation's political process to improve life on the
reservation.
   ``We want to reach out to them and urge them to vote,'' Jackson
said at a rally at an Indian museum. ``So many Native Americans
have simply been broken-hearted. They've been hurt so long they
feel a sense of betrayal. We have to get them involved.''
   Gore, falling deeper in debt and trailing badly in the polls,
began running commercials featuring New York City Mayor Edward Koch
urging voters to ``Vote positive. Vote Al Gore.''
   Koch also planned to march with Gore on Sunday in a Salute to
Israel parade, a gesture Gore hopes will help him capture some of
the Jewish voters who generally comprise 25 percent of the
Democratic primary turnout.
   The three Democratic candidates, seated on stage at the Eastman
Theater on Saturday for the League of Women Voters-sponsored
debate, appeared determined to set aside their differences and
concentrate on the vulnerabilities of their GOP opponent _
virtually certain to be Bush.
   Jackson defended his meetings with Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, Syrian president Hafez Assad and
Cuban president Fidel Castro.
   Jackson said he had appealed to Arafat to recognize Israel and
had thanked Assad for releasing a U.S. Navy flier.
   As for Castro, Jackson said he got the Cuban leader to release
political prisoners and said, ``If we have diplomatic relations
with Chile and South Africa on the one hand and China and Russia on
the other, we should not reduce our influence in our own hemisphere
with Cuba.''
   Not even a discussion of the Middle East, which has produced the
sharpest differences between the candidates during the New York
campaign, could shake their congeniality.
   Gore, who has taken the firmest pro-Israel stand, said the
United States should not talk to the PLO until that group renounces
terrorism ``such as blowing up school buses with innocent children
on them, renouncing that kind of act as an instrument of policy.''
   Jackson, who has been the most sympathetic toward the PLO,
quickly responded, ``You are right.'' Then he pointed out that
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ``said he wouldn't recognize
the PLO even if they recognized him.''
   Dukakis, recalling the step the late Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat took to end his country's state of war with Israel, said, ``I
don't see why it's so difficult for the other Arab leaders to do
what Sadat did.''
   Sadat eventually signed a peace treaty with Israel.
   The candidates greeted each other warmly after the debate with
Dukakis standing on the stage's wing while Jackson answered
questions from reporters, and Gore watched from behind a crowd of
journalists.
   ``I was going to ask you, `when are you going to get off that
stage,''' Gore joked to Jackson when he finally stepped down.
   Every published poll of likely New York Democratic primary
voters showed Dukakis leading Jackson by margins ranging from 6 to
nearly 17 percentage points. All the surveys said Gore was running
a distant third.
   In a Washington Post-ABC News poll published Sunday, Dukakis was
supported by 43 percent, Jackson 37 percent and Gore 13 percent.
The survey calculated the responses of 179 likely voters among 392
Democrats interviewed Thursday and Friday. The margin of error for
the poll was plus or minus 8 percentage points.
   Gore toured a market in the heart of a Polish neighborhood in
Buffalo and conceded that he is running behind in the state.
   ``At a minimum we have to have a strong finish to demonstrate
continued momentum,'' Gore said. ``But I'm not going to put
specific numbers on it.''
   He said he thought he had time to improve his standing and
added, ``It's a very volatile race.''
   Bush was expected to sweep the 96 Republican delegates at stake
on Tuesday. Half of the Bush delegates were running unopposed. His
only remaining opponent for the nomination, Pat Robertson, did not
campaign in the state and has said that Bush was ``going to be the
nominee of the Republican Party absent any unexpected eventuality.''
   While the Democratic candidates were campaigning and debating in
New York, where 255 delegates are at stake, Arizona Democrats,
whose favorite son, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, was an early
casualty in the Democratic race, held caucuses on Saturday to
allocate 36 delegates.
   Dukakis held a strong lead over Jackson in the earliest results
from two rural counties in Arizona. Those results involved about
300 votes reported by late Saturday night, while an estimated
25,000 to 30,000 people were expected to participate in the
caucuses.
   South Carolina and North Dakota, which use a three-step process
to select delegates, on Saturday held state conventions.
   North Dakota Democrats gave two-thirds of their 15 delegates to
the uncommitted while Dukakis got three and Jackson two. The state
convention was the final step in North Dakota's delegate selection
process which began with precinct caucuses last month.
   In South Carolina, where the party completed its
delegate-selection process begun with precinct caucuses March 12,
Jackson picked up almost two-third of the delegates on Saturday.
Jackson came up with 28 delegates, while Gore won eight and Dukakis
got seven.
   Allocation of the Arizona delegates will be determined by the
outcome of a presidential preference vote at the caucuses.
   Jackson was the only candidate to campaign in Arizona and his
state campaign coordinator John Norris said, ``I think we can win
Arizona. People committed to Jesse Jackson tend to be more apt to
go out and vote.''
   Dukakis had the backing of many top state Democrats and was the
leader in a poll taken several weeks ago. Gore spent neither time
nor money in the state.
   Gore borrowed another $100,000 from banks in his home state of
Tennessee, bringing his total campaign debt to $1.6 million.
Winless since Super Tuesday, when he demonstrated support across
the South, Gore was spending $700,000 on advertising in New York in
a bid to get back into contention.
   The Democratic candidates were scheduled to debate again on
Sunday, a televised appearance on WNBC. All three also planned to
appear at a senior citizen forum sponsored by city council
president Andrew Stein.

   The Canadian government proposed measures to reduce high Great Lakes water levels that are causing heavy damage to shoreline property in the U.S. and Canada.

   The proposals include removal of landfill in the Niagara River, which links Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
Environment Minister Tom McMillan also proposed an increased flow of water from Lake Erie through the Black Rock Canal, which runs along the U.S. shore of the upper Niagara River.

   The minister said the Canadian government "is committed to doing everything in its power to combat the problem of high water levels on the Great Lakes."
Even with normal precipitation, he warned that "dangerously high levels will persist on Lakes Michigan, Huron, St. Clair and Erie for at least another two to three years."
Lake St. Clair is between Lake Huron and Lake Erie.

   In the past 150 years, landfill by private property owners has blocked as much as 40% of the Niagara River bed in some locations, restricting water flow into Lake Ontario.
Mr. McMillan's landfill-removal proposal requires the consent of Ontario's provincial government.

   In Washington, a State Department official said the U.S. hasn't received Canada's proposal to increase the water flow through the Black Rock Canal.
Mr. McMillan said the flow could be increased by 1,200 cubic feet a second, an increase of less than 1% of the total average water flow between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.

   The International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency, also is expected to recommend later this year various measures to relieve the high-water problem, which has caused several hundred million dollars worth of damage in recent years.

   Mr. McMillan indicated that the commission may recommend, among other things, an increased diversion of water out of Lake Michigan at Chicago.
The diversion, which moves Great Lakes water to the Mississippi River system, is currently limited by a Supreme Court order to 3,200 cubic feet a second.
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.) has introduced legislation that would allow the Chicago water diversion to be increased to 10,000 cubic feet a second.

   Lakeshore property owners also have been campaigning for a halt to a Canadian diversion of about 5,600 cubic feet a second of water into Lake Superior from hydroelectric dams in Ontario, but the provincial government has opposed changing those flows.
Mr. McMillan asked the Ontario government to reconsider its position so that Canada will be able to respond immediately to any recommendations by the International Joint Commission.

   U.S. and Canadian hydrologists, meanwhile, said that changes in existing water diversions will have only a small impact on water levels.

   An Election Day storm dumped heavy snow on the Rockies and left
highways slippery on the western Plains, and snow over the Great
Lakes closed some Michigan schools.
   ``In some counties we've had trouble even getting poll workers
to the polls to open them up,'' said Nebraska Secretary of State
Allen Beermann.
   High wind knocked out power to thousands of customers in upstate
New York, and heavy rain soaked parts of New England.
   Heavy snow fell across parts of Wyoming from late Monday into
Tuesday. Snowfall totals ranged up to 17 inches at Sinks Canyon, 7
miles southwest of Lander; 13 inches at Lander; 12 inches at
Togwotee Pass, 40 miles northeast of Jackson; and up to a foot at
Casper. Casper Mountain got nearly 3 feet of snow in a 30-hour
period, the National Weather Service said.
   In Colorado, the National Weather Service said snow increased in
coverage and intensity in Denver and other Front Range areas during
the morning rush hour. The snow was driven by wind blowing at 15 to
25 mph, cutting visibility.
   Colorado ski resorts benefited from the storm, with Winter Park
getting up to 10 inches on Monday and Steamboat Springs 8 inches.
Meteorologists said accumulations of 6 to 12 inches were possible
in Colorado's northern and central mountains.
   Freezing drizzle iced roads near the Colorado-Kansas line.
   Western and north-central Nebraska was hit by snow, rain, wind
and cold and many voters needed chains on their car tires just to
get to the polls.
   Most of western Nebraska was covered with 2 to 3 inches of snow,
with reports of up to 5 inches on the ground in Kimball and 7
inches at O'Neill, said Larry Wirth of the weather service office
in Scottsbluff. Twelve inches fell at Greeley in the north-central
part of the state, the weather service said.
   ``It's snowing some and the wind is blowing and it's cold and
icy,'' said Lincoln County Clerk Nadine Heath at midmorning. ``I
understand in the rural areas it's really hard to see.''
   Another storm dumped up to 8 inches of snow on Michigan's
northern Lower Peninsula and caused scattered power outages from
Monday into early Tuesday.
   State police said snow forced the closing of at least four
northern Lower Peninsula school districts.
   A state police dispatcher at Alpena reported several minor
traffic accidents.
   ``It's still snowing and blowing and it's probably 7 or 8 inches
deep close to town and as you go out from the town it gets a little
deeper,'' dispatcher George Beebe said early Tuesday. ``A pretty
good percentage of the city is without power.''
   Just four days earlier, Michigan had a spell of Indian summer,
making the storm hard to take, said hairdresser Michelle Collins in
Houghton Lake.
   ``I wasn't expecting it. We had such a nice week,'' she said.
``From what the customers are saying coming in, it's pretty bad, a
lot of sleet, a lot of cars in ditches.''
   Wind gusting to more than 60 mph whipped through upstate New
York on Tuesday, downing trees and power lines. A peak gust of 63
mph was recorded at Buffalo, the weather service said.
   In Monroe County, N.Y., where wind was recorded at 59 mph,
officials reported numerous power outages and trees falling on cars
and houses. No injuries were reported.
   About a third of a church under construction in Pittsford
collapsed but no one was there at the time.
   At least 20,000 homes lost power from southern New York state to
Niagara Falls. All but a few hundred had been restored by noon,
said E. Alfred Osborne, a spokesman for Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
   Wind-whipped waves reached 8 feet on Lake Erie and 10 feet or
higher on Lake Ontario. Minor flooding was reported along the Lake
Erie shoreline south of Buffalo.
   High wind also buffeted parts of Maine, along with heavy rain.
Cape Elizabeth and the Portland area were lashed with wind
averaging 30 mph and gusts as high as 45 mph.
   ``A big storm developed very suddenly along the coast,'' said
Art Lester, a weather service meteorologist. ``The rain was very
heavy.''
   Southern New Hampshire also had pounding rain that cut into
morning voter turnout.

   A Cuban family from Florida that was
stranded in Canada after a sightseeing trip five months ago may
soon be granted political asylum, U.S. immigration officials said
Tuesday.
   Carlos Fajardo has provided information that substantiates his
claim that he would face political persecution if returned to Cuba,
said Benedict Ferro, district director of the federal Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   ``It is not a frivolous claim,'' Ferro said. ``We would not turn
people away under those circumstances.''
   Ferro would not discuss details of the case but did say that
pending a State Department review of the case, the Fajardos might
be allowed to return in a few weeks.
   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two children,
Yoradlys Diaz and Yoandys Diaz, have lived on charity since Dec.
23, when they were denied re-entry into the United States at the
Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls because they are illegal aliens.
The couple told border authorities that they had driven north to
find snow for Christmas and had ventured into Canada to view the
falls.
   The family lived for several weeks in a Niagara Falls, Ontario,
motel, then in a Fort Erie apartment under the sponsorship of
Ontario refugee groups.
   ``It looks like we may finally be able to work something out,''
said Sister Kathleen Rimar, Fajardo's Catholic Charities attorney
in Buffalo.
   Last month, Ferro denied Fajardo's application to return to
Miami on humanitarian parole. Despite pressure from charitable
organizations and from Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., Ferro had insisted
that the family not be readmitted because of their record of
immigration fraud and other unspecified evidence.
   Immigration officials said Tuesday Fajardo and his wife still
are guilty of substantial fraud against the U.S. government and
other offenses. But they also said such violations can be
overlooked in light of concern over possible persecution.
   Information regarding the potential for persecution for Fajardo
in Cuba, they added, was not available until he was allowed to
enter the United States late last month for an interview with
immigration officials in Buffalo.
   Sister Rimar said that, for the first time since December, the
family has some hope of returning to the Miami area. But their stay
in Canada has exhausted their resources, she said.
   ``Their situation is a mess,'' she said. ``They have no home or
business to return to, and they're in danger of having their car
repossessed. They'll have to start off basically with nothing and
work their way back again.''

   A Canadian has been arrested for
the second time this month on charges of attempting to perform a
stunt at Niagara Falls.
   Peter E. DeBernardi, 43, was arrested Tuesday near the base of
the Horseshoe Falls and charged with criminal trespass and
attempting to perform a stunt on parks property, said a Niagara
Parks Police spokesman.
   Police would not elaborate on DeBernardi's planned stunt. The
Buffalo News, quoting unidentified sources, said DeBernardi had a
length of rope with him and speculated that he might have planned
to try repeating a 1988 stunt in which he rappelled into the gorge
at the base of the falls.
   DeBernardi and two other men were arrested last week in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., while on their way to attempt a trip over the American
Falls in a plastic-foam ball. Last September, DeBernardi was part
of a two-man team that went over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel.

   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry: They didn't give
up your ship.
   The brigantine Niagara, restored to fighting trim and still
flying Perry's battle flag, ``Don't Give Up the Ship,'' is
scheduled to be returned to the Great Lakes on Saturday, exactly
175 years after Perry's fleet defeated the British in the Battle of
Lake Erie.
   ``Perry would recognize his old ship. This is as exact a
restoration as there can be,'' said Melbourne Smith, an Annapolis,
Md., marine architect who dismantled the Niagara and rebuilt it to
historical specifications.
   The 182-foot, 278-ton ship, restored for the third time with
$3.8 million in state and private money in dry dock at this port
city, will be outfitted by next spring with 118-foot and 113-foot
masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square feet of polyester sail
and 20 aluminum cannons.
   Then, it is to tour the Great Lakes and East Coast ports as
Pennsylvania's ``official flagship.''
   The first USS Niagara was one of six small ships built at Erie
during the War of 1812 and put under Perry's command to break a
British blockade of American Great Lakes ports and to defend the
Northwest Territory.
   On Sept. 10, 1813, Perry's nine-ship squadron met six British
vessels under Commodore Robert Heriot Barclay in a short but fierce
battle near Put-in-Bay, Ohio, that left 135 British and 123
American casualties.
   Perry's flagship, the USS Lawrence, was disabled by British fire
and Perry transferred to the Niagara, where he hoisted his famous
blue-and-white battle flag and attacked again. The Niagara helped
break the British battle line and forced Barclay to surrender.
   ``We have met the enemy and they are ours: two ships, two brigs,
one schooner and one sloop,'' Perry reported to his superiors.
   The Niagara served as a station ship in Erie until 1820, when
she was scuttled in nearby Misery Bay. The ship was raised by Erie
citizens in 1913 and restored for a Great Lakes tour to celebrate
the 100th anniversary of Perry's victory. She was restored again in
the 1930s and 1940s.
   The latest Niagara incorporates 42 pieces of the original ship,
some within view for visitors. Smith said the original wood is aged
and not strong enough for structural use.
   ``It will be obvious,'' he said.
   In 1813, a gang of about 300 shipwrights, blacksmiths and other
craftsmen and laborers, directed by New York shipbuilders Adam and
Noah Brown, hired on at Erie and built Perry's fleet in three
months. There were no sawmills in Erie, which then had only 500
inhabitants, and craftsmen cut, hewed and squared the unseasoned
wood by hand.
   ``It was all green wood from around here. It wouldn't last two
years,'' Smith said. ``But it didn't matter. This was a throwaway
boat for war.''
   Smith's modern crew of about 60, working over 99 days, included
shipwrights and carpenters experienced in restoring old ships. They
were assisted by laborers from the Pennsylvania Conservation Corps,
a job training program for disadvantaged youth.
   They worked in a dockyard where Perry's smaller gunboats were
built in 1813. The Niagara and Lawrence were built nearby,
according to project spokeswoman Maura McLaughlin.
   The Niagara's new 18-pound carronades, which are stubby cannons
for short-range use, and two 12-pound long guns, will be cast at an
Erie foundry of aluminum to save 10 tons of weight on deck. The
Navy removed the original cannons before sinking the Niagara.
   ``Ships like this weren't very safe to sail. They were top
heavy,'' Smith said. ``But it was wartime and it didn't matter. In
wartime, you do dangerous things.''
   Smith estimated a crew of about 35 will be needed to sail the
restored ship as it tours the Great Lakes beginning next summer.
The state does not plan to give rides or to rent the ship.

   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's brigantine
Niagara returned to the Great Lakes on Saturday, exactly 175 years
after his fleet defeated the British in the Battle of Lake Erie.
   ``We are starting a new page in Pennsylvania's history, and you
all are a part of it,'' Gov. Robert Casey told an estimated 5,000
people gathered for the launching ceremony.
   Casey's wife, Ellen, lifted a bottle of Erie County wine and
struck the 182-foot, 278-ton restored ship, bedecked with the
American flag and Perry's battle flag, ``Don't Give Up the Ship.''
The bottle didn't break, however, and she had to strike the ship
again, this time successfully.
   Shortly afterward, a crane lifted the ship into Lake Erie's
Presque Isle Bay. Eighteen cannons fired a military salute, and
more than 200 private boats anchored in the bay to watch the
festivities blared their horns.
   It was the fourth time the ship had been restored, this time
using $3.8 million in state and private funds.
   The restored Niagara will be outfitted by next spring with
118-foot and 113-foot masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square
feet of polyester sail and 20 aluminum cannon.

   The charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. But under federal sentencing guidelines, Ms. Cheng
would probably face no more than 14 months in prison when she is
sentenced Aug. 8.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a report
last July, named Ms. Cheng, 41, a resident alien who lives in New
York City, as a leader of a ring that charged would-be immigrants
$23,000 apiece to be smuggled into the United States.
   However, the indictment only charged her with the 1989 incident,
which was uncovered during a covert investigation by the INS and
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of traffic in illegal aliens
between Toronto and New York City.
   Her clients, according to court papers, included Li Jin Mu and
his wife, Wang Sai Zhen, the refugees whose plight became a test
case for the new U.S. policy allowing fear of forced abortions to
be grounds for political asylum.
   The papers state that Ms. Cheng personally met Li, his wife and
nephew at the Toronto airport last March and paid a driver $340 to
take them to the U.S. border at Queenston, Ontario. There, a second
driver took over, driving them across the border and across New
York state to Albany.
   In Albany, another member of the ring paid the driver $3,000 and
bought the Li family bus tickets to New York City. But the drivers
were undercover agents from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
the INS and all involved were arrested.
   Months later, after Li and his nephew had been deported and had
been caught in another smuggling attempt _ this time jammed in with
Uruguayan refugees in the back of a tractor-trailer _ the
government granted Li and his wife political asylum.
   For other aliens, the consequences have been tragic.
   Ms. Cheng's husband, Yick Tak Cheung, is charged with smuggling
dozens of aliens in small rubber rafts across the rapids below
Niagara Falls. Some of the rafts were equipped with cellular phones
that the aliens, or their couriers, could use to arrange for
drivers to meet them on the U.S. shore.
   But they apparently were not equipped with life jackets and four
aliens drowned when a raft deflated and sank in the ice-choked
river in late December 1988.
   ``That was particularly cruel and callous on the part of the
smugglers,'' Ingham says. ``We perceive many of these aliens as
victims.''
   Court papers filed in Yick's case said his ring recruited two
Lewiston taxi drivers to drive the aliens to New York City, without
at first telling them who their fares were. When the cab drivers
figured out what was going on, the threats began.
   In a sworn statement, cab driver James Dullan said an alleged
associate of Yick's told him, ``We take care of our own, one way or
the other.''
   ``I took it as a verbal threat,'' Dullan said. ``Work with him
or else.''
   Yick has pleaded innocent. His lawyer declined to comment.
   Aliens who cannot scrape together large sums of cash can still
use the smugglers' services. To pay their debts to the smugglers,
some pledge themselves to years of menial work in restaurants.
Others allow themselves to be recruited into Chinese organized
crime groups.
   ``It's a form of indentured servitude,'' says Dennis Peruzzini,
an INS investigator in Buffalo.
   While Chinese people comprise the single biggest nationality
involved, the border patrol has caught a veritable United Nations
of aliens in the past few years.
   Large numbers of Jamaicans and Guyanese attempted to sneak into
the United States until Canada toughened its visa requirements for
residents of those Caribbean countries. Agents on the New
York-Quebec border recently found a large group of immigrants from
India, apparently dumped there by a truck driver who panicked after
hearing about a state police truck check on the radio, Ingham said.
   Thirteen were found in a 4-foot-deep, 8-foot-wide hiding space
in a truck trailer at Lewiston in May.
   A smuggling operator arrested a few years ago brought Brazilians
into the country by leading them across the Niagara rapids on the
underside of a railroad bridge, Ingham says.
   ``He'd take the group from Toronto to Niagara Falls, Ontario, by
bus and then under cover of night, he'd take them down over the
side of the bridge and climb onto the arches,'' Ingham says. ``If
you have any degree of fear of heights, that is a scary place.''

WHAT is it about Canada that invites so many jokes? Denis Leary, the
American comedian, says he wants a Patriot missile launcher so that he can
sit in his swimming pool 'and blow up Canada'. I have always liked the
place. It is not particularly boring. Some of it is lively: Toronto, for
example, which many fair-minded souls would rate among the best cities in
North America: spacious, friendly, some distinguished modern architecture,
always a lot happening, excellent shopping and food - and safe. Toronto is
said to have very few muggers. Critics say Toronto is more about style than
substance, but they are the sort of people who probably like Detroit.
Last winter, short-stay travel between Britain and Ontario picked up
smartly. The most popular short-stay products were minibreaks in Toronto
(including Niagara Falls) and Ottawa, resort visits (snow-mobiling, dog
sledding, and cross-country and downhill skiing), and winter fly-drive
tours. The London-Toronto flight takes about six hours, so you can leave
London on Friday morning, have two and three-quarter days there and be back
in London by Monday morning.
Globespan (0737-773055) is selling London-Toronto flights from Pounds 239
plus tax, with hotels from Pounds 36 per room per night. Thomas Cook
(0733-330111) has short breaks in Toronto and Ottawa from Pounds 334, plus
Niagara Falls, resort stays and winter fly-drive. Capture Canada
(081-393-0127) has Toronto three-night breaks from Pounds 319 and the same
for Ottawa from Pounds 324. Travescene and Crystal Holidays are joining the
fray.
Another operator, All Canada Travel and Holidays (0502-585825), offers
practically everything, including skiing, winter sports and city breaks.
An example is an eight-day, self-drive Ontario winter-break giving three
nights in Toronto and four nights at one of two Muskoka hotels, Pow Wow
Point Lodge or the well-equipped Deerhurst Resort, three hours' drive from
Toronto. Prices per person (twin-bedded room) are Pounds 348-Pounds 375, or
Pounds 628-Pounds 698 for singles. Prices include seven nights'
accommodation, five days' car hire and basic insurance, but not
trans-Atlantic flights.
Air-fares are reasonable at present. Air Canada (081-759-2636) recently cut
Pounds 50 off some winter fares. Until March 31 1993, excluding the
Christmas period, it will quote you Pounds 259 return: Heathrow, Glasgow or
Manchester to Toronto (some booking restrictions; minimum stay seven
nights). If you only want to stay the weekend, check fares with bucket shops
or agents. (Word to the wise: Air Canada is a no-smoking carrier,
trans-Atlantic flights and all).
Once winter passes, you might want to use Toronto as a base or launch-pad
for touring the Great Lakes. Not all at once, though. There are five Great
Lakes - Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior - with a total coastline
of 11,000 miles.
The Great Lakes region includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the US, and Ontario in Canada -
427,358 square miles, almost as large as the EC. There are 637 state parks,
two national parks, 191 downhill ski areas, 47,000 miles of snow-mobile
trails, more than 5,000 miles of cross-country ski trails, and 4,659 golf
courses.
I visited Deerhurst Resort recently, north of Toronto, and found it sporty
and relaxed. It has facilities for almost everything. Close by is Algonquin
provincial park, excellent for canoeing (more than 800 miles of canoe
routes), backpacking, fishing and wildlife. As well as moose, black bears
and other big things, Algonquin hosts two members of the jumping mice
family, the meadow jumping mouse and the woodland jumping mouse. Not many
people know that.
From Deerhurst, I returned to Toronto, took the train to Windsor, crossed
the US border into Michigan (close your eyes when passing through Detroit)
and drove 180 miles, via Kalamazoo, to the eastern shore of Lake Michigan,
stopping at one of the most picturesque and charming small fishing ports -
South Haven - you could hope to find. If you make it to South Haven and are
travelling with the chairman's wife, try and stay at the Old Harbour Inn
(515 Williams St, tel: (616)-637-8480. You will not find better-appointed
jacuzzi suites or nicer beds for. . . 11,000 miles.

   A man who paddled a kayak over
Niagara Falls in a stunt was still missing this morning and parks
police resumed their search.
   The red kayak of Jessie W. Sharp, 28, of Ocoee, Tenn., was
recovered Tuesday afternoon below Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side. The kayak was ``all in one piece ... in fairly good condition,
all things considered,'' said Maureen Quinn, a constable with the
Niagara Parks Police.
   ``Our regular patrol is watching the river,'' Sgt. Jim Dugos said
this morning. He said police can't dive there to look for a body.
   Asked if the man were presumed dead, he said: ``You never know.
Sometimes these people turn up.''
   Ken Kitchen was working in a tower overlooking the Niagara river
when he saw Sharp in his kayak. Trying to stop him, the utility
closed the dam gates, reducing the water flow to the falls, Kitchen
said.
   The man's boat grounded, but he picked it up and moved it into
the middle of the water.
   ``We did what we could to try and stop him, but there wasn't much
time,'' Kitchen said. ``He was gone before our help could get there.
All we could do was sit and watch helplessly.''
   The Canadian falls are 181 feet high, or about as tall as a
13-story building.
   Sharp, who was last seen at about 1:45 p.m., was trying to
complete a stunt that had been planned for about 10 years, said
constable Kim Davis. Police said nobody before had ever tried to
kayak over the falls.
   ``Barrels, yes,'' Quinn said of other attempts to go safely over
the falls in enclosed capsules. But, she said, ``it doesn't seem
plausible he could do it (and survive).''
   Since 1901, at least 12 people have gone over the falls in
barrels or rubber balls; nine have survived.
   ``It's beyond me why anyone would attempt this,'' said George
Bailey of the Niagara Parks Commission. ``He obviously doesn't know
our falls.''
   Bailey said the man was accompanied by a film crew and a friend
who took photographs.
   ``He had all the confidence in the world, according to his
friend,'' Bailey said.
   During a press conference Tuesday, police showed a videotape of
the kayaker shot by a tourist. The tape shows a man in a boat
emblazoned with ``Rapidman'' on one side successfully negotiating
the rapids of the Niagara River just before the falls. Then, he
disappears.

   A man who persuaded co-workers to
take a side trip to Niagara Falls because it was his lifelong wish
to visit here collapsed and died after fulfilling his dream,
authorities said.
   Eugene Gergler, 68, of Cincinnati collapsed Friday night in the
parking lot on Goat Island, between the American and Horseshoe
Falls, and was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later,
said state park police Officer Patrick Moriarty.
   Gergler and three other electricians had been working in Erie,
Pa., earlier Friday when he told them his lifelong dream was to see
the falls, Moriarty said. So the four drove 120 miles to Niagara
Falls.
   He said Gergler complained of feeling ill while taking pictures
of the falls and went back to the group's truck, where his
companions found him unconscious.

   A daredevil who went over Niagara
Falls in a barrel in 1985 tried again Sunday but low water stranded
his barrel at the brink of the falls, police said.
   The barrel carrying Dave Munday, 53, stopped a foot before the
brink of the 176-foot Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side of the
Niagara River. Police used a crane to fish the daredevil and his
barrel out of the river rapids.
   Niagara Parks Police, who patrol the park along the Canadian
side of the twin waterfalls, said Munday's barrel was dropped into
the river about 660 feet upstream of the Horseshoe Falls about 4:40
a.m.
   The Ontario Hydro electric utility had been diverting half the
river's flow overnight to power its hydroelectric plant, said
police spokesman George Bailey. The low river level helped snag the
barrel on the falls' rocky ledge, he said.
   Munday ``really doesn't know the river like a lot of people
thought he did,'' Bailey said. ``There was very little water going
over the falls, and he probably could have guessed that he would
get stuck.''
   ``I've never been a religious man, but something stopped it,''
Munday told The Associated Press Sunday night from his home in
Caistor Center, Ontario. ``Probably I would have been dead if it
went over.''
   Mundy said he was lying on his side inside the 650-pound,
7-foot-long barrel when it became stuck. He said part of the barrel
actually hung over the edge of the falls.
   ``If you tried it a thousand times you wouldn't be able to get
it to do that again,'' he said.
   Munday was the seventh person to successfully go over the falls
in a vessel. Three others before him died.
   After his 1985 trip, Munday told reporters, ``Anyone who would
go over the falls twice would have to be crazy.'' But since then,
he had boasted that he would do it again one day.
   Had he been successful Sunday, Munday would have become the
first person to survive two trips over the falls.
   During Sunday's attempt, the steel and foam barrel lodged on the
riverbed a foot from the Table Rock tourist area at the brink of
the falls, police said.
   Two park constables were able to bring the barrel to a wall at
the edge of the falls and secure it there while a crane was brought
to the site. The constables fashioned a sling and, using long
poles, positioned the barrel so it could be lifted up and away from
the brink.
   The rescue took two hours and ``put two people's lives in
jeopardy,'' Bailey said.
   When the barrel was lowered into the tourist area, Munday
emerged and was charged with violating laws that prohibit river
stunts. He faces a fine of up to $10,000 _ about $8,500 in U.S.
dollars. Police kept Munday's barrel.
   After his first ride, Munday was fined the maximum $1,000 for
trespassing and $500 for the stunt itself. In March, the maximum
fine was raised to $10,000 to discourage such stunts, Bailey said.
   Last month, a man who attempted to go over the falls in a kayak
apparently lost his life in the stunt. The battered kayak belonging
to Jessie Sharp, of Ocoee, Tenn., was found below the falls, but
his body has not been recovered.

   Two Asian women and their two children
apparently drowned in the fast-moving Niagara River while trying to
enter the United States illegally in a rubber raft, federal
authorities said today.
   The four may have been provided with the boat by smugglers, said
Benedict Ferro, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Buffalo.
   ``These people didn't have a chance in the world,'' said Ronald
McNamee of the New York State parks police.
   The body of one of the women, an Asian in her 30s, was recovered
Tuesday afternoon in Youngstown, about 10 miles north of Niagara
Falls.
   The victim was believed to have been accompanied by another woman
and two children, ages 13 and 7, who were missing and presumed
drowned, officials said. Authorities searched the river and Lake
Ontario for the three today.
   McNamee said officials learned of the accident after a tipster
called and said four people he was supposed to meet in the United
States didn't show up.
   ``It's hazardous enough to try to cross the river then (in
summer),'' Ferro said. ``The water out there is cold and the strong
currents are unpredictable.''
   The temperature early Tuesday when the four are believed to have
started their trek was near zero.
   Ferro said all four were believed to be from Malaysia.
   ``We think this may be part of a major alien smuggling ring,'' he
said. Ferro said 11 people were caught trying to use rubber rafts to
cross the Niagara from Ontario to New York state last summer.
   The ring is believed to smuggle illegal aliens from Hong Kong to
Vancouver, and then through Toronto and St. Catharines into the
United States for $2,000 each, McNamee said.
   A purse, two suitcases and the raft were found by the Coast Guard
on Tuesday, McNamee said. The purse contained a Malaysian passport,
he said.

   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's brigantine
Niagara was lowered slowly into the waters of Presque Isle Bay with
a new mission _ ``official flagship'' for Pennsylvania.
   The launching of the restored ship Saturday came 175 years to
the day after Perry's fleet defeated the British in the Battle of
Lake Erie and issued the famous War of 1812 dispatch, ``We have met
the enemy and they are ours.''
   ``We are starting a new page in Pennsylvania's history, and you
all are a part of it,'' Gov. Robert Casey told several thousand
people gathered for the launching ceremony.
   Casey's wife, Ellen, lifted a bottle of Erie County wine and
struck the 182-foot, 278-ton restored ship, bedecked with the
American flag and Perry's battle flag, ``Don't Give Up the Ship.''
   Brent Glass, executive director of the Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission, said the weekend festivities went smoothly
overall.
   ``We admire today a great hero, Oliver Hazard Perry,'' Glass
told a crowd during the launching ceremony. ``But also remember
those men invisible to history _ the 155 men who served on the
Niagara.''
   Casey called the Niagara ``the cornerstone of new development
projects already planned at Erie's bayfront.'' The ship was
restored for the fourth time with $3.8 million in state and private
funds.
   The Niagara will be outfitted by next spring with 118-foot and
113-foot masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square feet of
polyester sail and 20 aluminum cannon.
   It will then tour the Great Lakes and East Coast ports as
Pennsylvania's flagship.

   The remains of 28 American soldiers
killed in the War of 1812 were taken from Canada to their native
soil in flag-draped caskets Thursday in the first repatriation
ceremony held between the two countries.
   ``There can be no finer expression of the good relations between
our countries than the reverence we show for these men,'' George
Hees, Canadian minister of veterans affairs, said as he transferred
possession of the remains to U.S. officials.
   The ceremony took place near Old Fort Erie, the scene of some of
the worst fighting of the war. On a shaded lawn where their
predecessors traded musket fire, 230 U.S. and Canadian soldiers
saluted the 28 caskets.
   Among the units participating was the 3rd U.S. Infantry, known
as the Old Guard, which traces its history to the War of 1812.
   ``This is the day these men waited 174 years for,'' said U.S.
Army Lt. Col. Robert Trotter. ``They are coming home.''
   Thomas Niles, U.S. ambassador to Canada, Niles praised Canadians
as good neighbors with a respect for history.
   Niles compared the effort to recover the War of 1812 soldiers to
the American government's search for servicemen lost in Southeast
Asia, pledging, ``We will continue to work on that problem until it
is solved.''
   After the ceremony, 28 hearses carried the caskets over the
Peace Bridge that links Fort Erie and Buffalo, N.Y. Fighter jets
flew by the bridge in missing-man formation.
   The procession continued to Bath National Cemetery in central
New York, where officials dedicated a memorial to the soldiers. The
remains will be buried privately Friday.
   A crowd of more than 500 stood in chilly air and a strong wind
off Lake Erie to attend the Fort Erie ceremony.
   ``We're all Americans really, North Americans. That border
doesn't really mean that much,'' said Hugh Lyrea, a Canadian
veteran.
   Heinz Hummel, mayor of Fort Erie, said the soldiers' sacrifice
paved the way to an undefended border between the two nations.
   ``Their death was the beginning of our peace,'' Hummel said.
   The repatriation ceremonies marked the beginning of the annual
Friendship Festival between the United States and Canada, which
celebrates continuous peace between the two nations since 1814.
   ``We could not ask for a more symbolic gesture,'' said Patrick
Mines, a festival organizer from Fort Erie.
   The remains of the servicemen were discovered during residential
construction in Fort Erie in October 1987.
   Archaeologists determined that the skeletons were American but
were unable to make individual identifications. The men are
believed to have been killed during a British siege on a U.S.
position at Snake Hill in 1814.
   Ronald Williamson, head of the scientific team in charge of the
excavation, said the victims ranged in age from mid-teens to 40 and
died gruesome deaths. At least 12 of the skeletons showed evidence
of tremendous wounds, presumably from musket or cannon fire, he
said.
   Historians say many of those who participated in the bitterly
fought Niagara campaign in the closing days of the war were
militiamen from western and central New York.
   Military officials officials said Bath was chosen as a burial
site because it was the closest national cemetery.

   A Cuban family stranded in Canada by
immigration problems since December will not be allowed to return
to their home in Miami while their application for asylum is
pending, federal officials said Thursday.
   Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said he has denied a bid for humanitarian
parole for Carlos Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and
her two children, Yoradlys Diaz and Yoandys Diaz.
   The decision was the result of new information immigration
officials uncovered about the family, Ferro said. ``In this case,
the negative aspects (of granting a parole) far outweighed the
evidence on their behalf,'' he said.
   Ferro would not elaboratem, but said the decision was separate
from the family's asylum claim, which will be decided in a few
weeks.
   The family have been stranded in Ontario since Dec. 23, when
they crossed into Niagara Falls to view the Canadian falls and were
denied permission to return to the United States because of what
officials said is a history of immigration fraud.
   Their plight has drawn national attention, with Hispanic groups
and Florida lawmakers appealing to INS officials for their return.
   Although they were illegal aliens, they lived for several years
in Miami, where they owned a home and boat-building business and
were active in community affairs.
   Last month, Fajardo sought a special dispensation to return to
the United States while the application for political asylum was
being considered. The process takes several months and Fajardo said
he wanted his children to return to school and that he needed to
tend to his business.
   The family lives in Fort Erie, Ontario, under the care of
refugee assistance groups.
   ``They've been holding out hope that the decision would be
positive,'' said Sister Margaret Quinn of the Niagara Inter-Church
Refugee Committee. ``They've been going on that strength. Now this
will be a real disappointment.''
   Sister Margaret said the children have been attending school but
have language problems. She said Fajardo and his wife, who are
prevented from working in Canada, were bored.
   Fajardo said Thursday he was unsure of why INS officials had
denied the parole and that he was hoping his lawyer could explain
the decision.

   A strike by Canadian truck drivers over
proposed tax increases and the U.S.-Canadian free-trade agreement
began disrupting production at auto plants in both nations as it
entered its third day today.
   Canadian Transport Minister Doug Lewis flew today from Ottawa to
Windsor to meet with protest leaders. But when the sides emerged
from a meeting to announce agreement, angry truckers shouted them
down.
   They shouted they would continue the blockades until all the
issues that led to the strike are resolved and they see a written
agreement. Details of what the leaders agreed to were not announced.
   The protest choked off shipments of parts to the General Motors
of Canada Ltd. assembly plant in Ste. Therese, Quebec, where 3,000
workers worked half a shift before being sent home Wednesday.
   Half-shifts were planned at the plant again today. GM also sent
home 11,000 day-shift workers at three plants in Oshawa, Ontario,
because of a lack of parts, spokesman Nick Hall.
   Production also was disrupted at plants run by Chrysler Canada
and Ford of Canada.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and Honda
of America Manufacturing Inc. said production at their U.S. plants
could be curtailed if the protest continued much longer.
   At Fort Erie, Ontario, near Niagara Falls, about 130 trucks
jammed the approaches to the international Peace Bridge today as
the protest spread to New York state's borders.
   The truckers blocked all commercial lanes of the bridge linking
Fort Erie and Buffalo, N.Y., to protest the free trade agreement
with the United States and the goods and services tax that the
Canadian government plans to impose next year.
   Some American truckers have joined the protest, either in
sympathy with the Canadians or because of grievances of their own.
   More than 300 truckers parked their rigs Wednesday along more
than three miles of the highway leading to the Ambassador Bridge
between Windsor and Detroit. They remained there this morning,
parked in a line that led all the way to customs brokerage offices,
blocking only the truck lanes.
   There also were about two dozen rigs on the bridge blocking
truck traffic entering Windsor from Detroit.
   Hundreds more truckers blocked traffic on the Blue Water Bridge
between Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Mich., according to Oscar
Vazquez, bridge safety officer for the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   Quebec truck drivers on Wednesday partially lifted a blockade
that began Monday, but they continued to prevent U.S. trucks from
leaving or entering the province.
   Authorities at the bridges described the protests as peaceful
and said cars were crossing without delays.
   Truckers at Fort Erie said competition from American drivers was
making it impossible for them to stay in business.
   ``The Canadian trucker's going to be extinct,'' said Randy
Blackmore of Chatham, Ontario, a spokesman for the truckers.
``There won't be a Canadian trucker five years from now.''
   The protest was over planned increases in Canadian taxes on
everything from the goods that truckers haul to the tires,
insurance and diesel fuel they buy.
   The Canadian drivers complain that U.S. drivers have been able
to undercut them because they aren't paying nearly as much in
taxes. The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove almost
all tariffs over a 10-year period, will further handicap Canadian
truckers, they said.
   ``We want the government to take some of these taxes off of
us,'' said Hollie Greer, a trucker from Harrow who parked his truck
in the row of rigs along Huron Church Street in Windsor. ``They are
taxing us to death.''
   A four-hour meeting Wednesday between protest leaders and
Ontario officials produced no agreement to end the blockade
immediately. But Bill Wrye, Ontario minister of transportation,
pledged to increase enforcement of regulations against U.S.
truckers within a few days.

   Lech Walesa will not lay a wreath in Ottawa on
Armistice Day as he had requested, but the argument raged Monday
about who was to blame.
   The Canadian Labor Congress said Walesa, who founded Poland's
independent trade union Solidarity in 1980 and won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1983, was shut out by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Mulroney's office denied the charge, and the Foreign office said
the union federation decided Friday that Walesa would skip the
ceremonies at the cenotaph, or national monument to the dead, in
Ottawa.
   Walesa is to arrive Friday in Montreal for a four-day private
visit to Canada arranged by the labor federation. Walesa asked the
congress some time ago to arrange for him to lay a wreath Saturday
in the federal capital of Ottawa because Nov. 11 is Poland's
independence day.
   He had been tentatively scheduled to be in Ottawa Saturday for
the televised national observance of Remembrance Day, as Nov. 11 is
known in Canada, and return to Ottawa two days later for meetings
with Mulroney and other dignitaries.
   Now his schedule is to go to Toronto late Friday and on Saturday
place a wreath at the cenotaph in Toronto.
   Derik Hodgson, a labor congress spokesman, said Monday the
Foreign Office vetoed plans for Walesa to lay a wreath in Ottawa on
behalf of the federation's 2 million members and ``we were told
(the order) came from the prime minister's office.
   ``They said it would be a breach of protocol, that it would be
embarrassing to the prime minister if Walesa participated before he
officially meets with Mulroney.''
   Hodgson said meetings with Foreign Office officials were held
over a period of weeks and labor congress officials were told
repeatedly it was the prime minister's office that did not want
Walesa included in the national observances in Ottawa.
   ``I would hate to think it was because our prime minister was
vain and didn't want to share the stage with someone so well
known,'' Hodgson added.
   Mulroney will lay a wreath at the ceremonies on behalf of the
government of Canada.
   A different version was given by Gilbert Lavoie, the prime
minister's press secretary. He said Walesa was scheduled to meet
with Mulroney on Monday.
   Then last week the labor group asked if Walesa could instead
meet Mulroney on Saturday to accommodate a planned visit by Walesa
to Niagara Falls, Ont., on Monday, Lavoie said.
   ``We said no,'' said Lavoie. ``You don't change the prime
minister's schedule at the last minute because you're planning a
meeting in Niagara Falls.''
   Rejane Dodd of the Foreign Office said of the conflicting
accounts: ``I'm telling you what I've been told. I find it strange.
It's totally different. I doubt very much our people would give me
wrong information.''
   Hodgson claimed Murray Fairweather, director of the U.S.S.R. and
Eastern Europe division at the Foreign Office, threatened to cancel
Walesa's trip if the labor congress pressed the matter.
   Ms. Dodd said: ``Anybody is free to come to Canada. ... I don't
think you can cancel a visit like this.''

<TEXT>
   A plan to create a new rail link between key
East Coast ports and the Canadian interior may fall apart because
of a short stretch of tracks between Buffalo and Niagara Falls,
N.Y.
   The tracks - known as the Buffalo-Niagara Gateway - belong to
the Consolidated Rail Corp., which has gone to a special court over
the dispute with Canadian Pacific Ltd.
   ``I wouldn't want to be in the position of saying what's
motivating Conrail in all of this but certainly a major competitor
in their back yard has got to be of concern to them,'' Canadian
Pacific spokesman John Cox said last week.
   ``There are two issues embedded in one - whether the trackage
rights are available to us and, second, what the cost will be.
Right now we're blocked on both fronts,'' he said.
   Canadian Pacific has offered to buy the financially ailing
Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway and link it at Niagara Falls to CP Rail
tracks into southern Ontario. If it can't get the trackage rights,
CP may withdraw its $25 million offer, Cox said.
   Cox said the stretch of track was about 15 miles long. On
Monday, Conrail said it was 30 miles. Cox could not be reached to
resolve the discrepancy because of the Canadian holiday of
Thanksgiving on Monday. The spokesman for D&amp;H was not in his office
Monday.
   The link is vital to Canadian Pacific's plan to use the D&amp;H
system to connect the ports of Philadelphia and New York with the
Canadian interior. If CP can put all the pieces together, it will
be competing directly with Conrail for freight in the Northeast.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad,
filed in July 1988 for protection from its creditors under U.S.
bankruptcy laws. The railroad, which runs from Montreal to
Washington and between Albany and Buffalo, owes about $100 million.
   CP took over operation of the D&amp;H in August and agreed to absorb
any further financial losses, which had been running at about
$200,000 a month.
   On Oct. 1, Conrail took the track dispute to a special
three-judge court, which was created in the 1970s to oversee the
railroad bankruptcy proceedings that created Conrail. Court
spokesman Richard Eriksen said the panel would hear the case in
Washington sometime between Oct. 10 and the end of the month.
   ``Conrail filed its motion with the special court because that
court has indicated in the past that Conrail should bring cases
Conrail believes are under the court's jurisdiction to the special
court,'' Conrail spokesman David Neurohr said last week.
   On Monday, Neurohr said Conrail believes CP should pay its fair
share to maintain the Buffalo-Niagara tracks, although he declined
to give dollar amounts.
   ``Under Conrail's proposal, CP and Conrail would both contribute
capital funds proportionate to each railroad's use of the tracks,''
Neurohr said, reading from a statement. ``Although the tracks are
now in satisfactory condition, the dramatic increase in tonnage
proposed by CP is likely to impose an expensive maintenance and
repair burden on Conrail that would not otherwise be incurred.''
   Conrail negotiated trackage rights with D&amp;H in 1976 but those
rights were never exercised, Cox said. Conrail is arguing that
those rights would not extend to CP as the new D&amp;H owner.
   In addition, Cox said, Conrail is seeking to raise the per-car
cost for running trains over its tracks.
   ``Standard agreements between railways these days for operating
trains over another railway's line - it's a mileage rate per car -
can be anything between about 21 or 22 cents per car-mile to 50 to
55 cents per car-mile,'' he said.
   That would translate to $6 to $10 per car, he said.
   ``But what they're looking for is $145 in each direction, so
that's a bit of difference,'' he said.
   This is the second time that Conrail has thrown up a roadblock
in CP's effort to buy the D&amp;H. Earlier this year, Conrail refused
to negotiate the rights to its tracks between Hagerstown, Md., and
Harrisburg, Pa. This led CP to withdraw its initial $35 million bid
for the D&amp;H.
   CP later offered $25 million for the D&amp;H, a bid that was
accepted in May by the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the railroad's
reorganization.
   Last week, the Interstate Commerce Commission added its
unanimous vote of approval to the deal, and the matter appeared to
be headed to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., for the
finishing touches.
   But that hearing has been postponed from Oct. 10 to Nov. 2
because of the special court case.
   CP owns about 14,000 miles of tracks in Canada and about 5,000
in the United States.

<TEXT>     Now, thanks to the latest National Geographic TV special, "Great Lakes,
Fragile Seas" (Wednesday, 8 p.m., Ch. 9), we can learn a lot more about the
lakes and the imposing challenges that threaten their long-term survival.;
This excellent hour documentary, written, produced and photographed by Joe
Seamans, contains some facts that may amaze most of us, including:;    (box)
The five lakes -- Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior -- hold at least
six quadrillion gallons of water, enough to flood all 48 contiguous states to
a depth of 10 feet.;    (box)  The largest lakes are so huge that they
frequently have stormy "seas" that rival those found in the world's oceans.;
 (box)  More than 10,000 vessels have sunk while crossing the Great Lakes.;
(box)  The flow in the lakes is so complex that it may take nearly 100 years
for toxic chemicals to completely wash out of their waters.;    (box)  The
lakes contain about 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.;
Scooped out by glacial action about 20,000 years ago, the Great Lakes face
several simultaneous ecological crises brought about by humans' intense use of
their waters in just the past 200 years.;    Seamans' camera shows us deformed
fish and birds, genetically damaged by toxic chemicals still present in the
waters despite heroic efforts to clean them up after a 1972 pact between the
U.S. and Canadian governments.;    We also see what amounts to "biological
pollution" from the destructive Zebra mussels, now multiplying rapidly in the
lakes and destroying the natural food chain by siphoning off up to 50 percent
of all nutrients needed by native lake species.;    Experts studying the
problem believe that the mussels, native to the Caspian and Black seas, were
carried into the lakes by seagoing foreign vessels. If Americans and Canadians
hadn't built a complex system of locks and waterways, linking the lakes to the
Atlantic, these marauders never would have turned up.;     Diversity of life;
Originally, lakes Ontario and Erie were linked only by the Niagara River. The
spectacular Niagara Falls served as a natural barrier to invasion of outside
species. But the human-made bypass of the falls opened the doorway to what may
be ecological disaster.;    Seamans' far-ranging film aptly demonstrates the
diversity of life on the lakes, beyond the skyscraper-lined cities along their
shores. For example, we visit remote Madeline Island on Lake Superior, which
is reached only by "wind sleds" during the icy winters, and a Chippewa Indian
community, where wild rice is harvested in preserved wetlands the same way it
was 200 years ago.;    Wreckage explored; In what may be the film's most
bizarre excursion, we probe the depths of Lake Superior by robot mini-sub to
explore the wreckage of the 729-foot steel freighter Edmund Fitzgerald, which
split in half and sank during a tremendous storm in 1975.;    Though "Great
Lakes, Fragile Seas" does include some sobering information, it's not a
downer. Progress is being made in halting the environmental threats to the
lakes. They're even pulling big, beautiful, edible fish from the same waters
that once caught fire; so it seems there is cause for cautious optimism after
all. (box)  </TEXT>

FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: Sensual delights in a palace of illusions - Susan
Moore enjoys a night-time stroll amid the fountains and flowers of Cordoba's
magical Moorish mosque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORDOBA'S Moorish mosque is a wonder of the world - especially wondrous in
its deceit. It is the original Tardis, though its delapidated exterior
passes for a warehouse rather than police box.
Outside, in the sunshine, parties of school-children shriek like starlings.
But take one step into the chill and gloomy silence and you encounter the
edge of a forest of towering stone trees, from which spring branches of
double arches banded pink and white. Everywhere you turn there are endless
undulations of pink and white.
Its grove of purloined columns are Roman, Visigoth, Byzantine and Moorish,
of marble, jasper, breccia, porphyry and granite. This Islamic structure
tells almost the entire story of western architecture - not least since,
after the reconquest, its heart was ripped out and replaced by a Catholic
cathedral. The glittering mosaics of the mihrab, which remains the mosque's
true holy of holies, seem like stained glass windows patterned with Persian
carpets.
Once the mosque opened on to the orangery. In this cobbled patio the live
trees - probably originally date palms, echoing the columns within - sit in
a series of circular beds linked like beads on a string by narrow irrigation
channels. Any excess precious water could run like quicksilver from one bead
to another. It does not take long in Cordoba or Granada to realise that
water is the supreme delicacy of Moorish Spain. It is a building material as
effective as brick or stone, and with it the Moors realised their genius for
combining architecture and horticulture.
Murmuring, cooling fountains are the sensualist's delight. Water-filled
stone lotus flowers lie close to the ground to be appreciated from the thick
pile of carpets placed in the shade of orange trees or in the cooler loggia.
Moorish gardens are infinitely subtle. That is why the celebrated restored
gardens of the Generalife, higher up the Alhambra hill, come as such a
shock. The noise] It is a relative Niagra, with inauthentic and energetic
jets of water playing into the large pool of the Patio de la Acequia, high
kicking in unison like Hollywood dancing girls.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays during the season, the Alhambra palace and gardens
are open from 10pm to midnight. A night visit is surreal and haunting.
Passing through the oblique entrance to the Moorish Lion Court is like
approaching a party. You cannot see a soul, but as you enter the hum of
chatter becomes a roar. Drinkless guests weave their way through the
colonnades or cluster in groups; policemen lurk in the shadows. The art is
to wait like a hawk and pounce on the perfect moment, the lull between
gaggles of French and Spanish. The Alhambra demands solitude and silence.
At that moment the great Court of the Myrtles is completely still. The low
central pool is a smooth, dark sheet of water ingeniously fed to the brim
and therefore a perfect mirror to the arcades of ornate filligree
plasterwork, the gleaming tiles and the indigo sky. The burbling fountain is
just audible; myrtle scent hangs in the air.
Meandering on, the palace becomes ever more magical - but exaggerated and
distorted. Nuances are lost in the dramatic chiaroscuro. Arcades are doubled
in height by their reflections. A Banksea rose transforms a 30 ft Cypress
tree into a giant in yellow flamenco frills. The town below is a sea of
twinkling lights, with the disembodied noises of playing children, barking
dogs and hooting cars rising eerily upwards.
As we dawdled our way out through the imposing circular arcaded courtyard of
Charles V's palace, the exasperated guards finally lost their patience and
switched off all the lights. For a minute we stood in the centre of this
immense bullring-cum-coliseum, alone, dwarfed and silent in the moonlight.
It might have been Italy - or a stage set by de Chirico - but for the bull's
heads in the frieze of the colonnade.
The palace of Charles V is arguably the finest Renaissance palace in Spain,
but how odd its rusticated bulk looks. It seems an aberration, an historical
hiccup. Andalucia is magnificently raw, emotive, defiant. Classicism is far
less at home there than the astounding local versions of the Baroque.
There is nothing in the world to prepare you for the 'Churrigueresque'
sacristy of the Cartuja, or Carthusian monastery, at Granada - not least the
rest of the monastery complex. In extreme contrast is the vast and austere
16th century refectory, lined with paintings illustrating harrowing scenes
of the persecutions suffered by the Order in Reformation England.
The sacristy, which sets St Bruno in an altarpiece of marbled marzipan,
seems a tour-de-force of the confectioner's art. Exuberant over-wrought
stucco work ripples and oozes and looks less like plaster than piped icing.
It may be excessive, but in spirit it seems to belong: an 18th century
descendant of the richly detailed ornamental stucco of the Alhambra.

   Strong winds from Canada hit the northeastern United States on
Thursday, downing power lines and trees and blowing out windows in
some areas, while snow fell in higher elevations in the West.
   Winds in western New York gusted to 63 mph at Youngstown, 68 mph
at Buffalo, 69 mph at Niagara Falls, and 78 mph at Brockport. In the
Midwest, winds gusted to 58 mph at Cleveland and to 53 mph at Erie,
Pa.
   Storm warnings were in effect for Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A
gale warning also was in effect for Lake Huron and along the coasts
of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, southern New Jersey, New Hampshire
and Maine.
   Showers and thundershowers extended from New York through West
Virginia to the coast of Texas.
   Showers extended from the northern and central Pacific Coast to
the northern Rockies, with snow in some high elevations. Up to 4
inches of new snow had fallen in the mountain passes of the Sierra
Nevada range. In Colorado's mountains, up to 8 inches of snow was
expected.
   The south-central states had sunny skies. Temperatures were above
70 degrees from south-central Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast,
with readings in the 80s across southern Florida and along the
western Gulf Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 27
degrees at Devils Lake, N.D., and Dickinson, N.D., to 89 degrees at
Kingsville, Texas. The low for the nation Thursday morning was 8
degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Friday, the National Weather Service forecast showers and
thunderstorms extending from central and eastern Texas to the middle
Missouri Valley, and showers from the northern and central Pacific
Coast to the northern and central Rockies, with snow showers in the
higher elevations. Rain showers were expected to be numerous across
Washington and Oregon. Scattered rain and snow were predicted from
New York to Maine.
   High temperatures were expected to be mostly in the 40s from the
northern Pacific Coast through the northern and central Plateau
region and across Nebraska and the Dakotas to northern New England.
Temperatures should be above 70 degrees from the Southwest deserts
across southern and central Texas to Florida and southern Georgia,
80s in Florida and south-central and southeastern Texas, and
generally in the 50s and 60s elsewhere in the nation.
