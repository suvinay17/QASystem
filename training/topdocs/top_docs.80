PREVIEW: FESTIVAL BRINGS A BIT OF THE EMERALD ISLE TO L.A.

Dennis Doyle vividly remembers the Sunday morning 15 years ago when a visiting 
Irish priest conducted Mass in Gaelic. Doyle, a third-generation Irishman, had 
never heard the ancient language of his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"Something inside me stirred," said Doyle, an English teacher at Glendale 
Community College, and church pianist. "I woke up. I wanted to learn about my 
culture, my history. I began studying the harp. It's the national instrument of 
Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Doyle, 37, is an acclaimed harpist, specializing in Ireland's 
traditional forms of music. He tours festivals and gives concerts and lectures 
throughout the country several months each year. Doyle will perform at the 16th 
annual Grand National Irish Fair and Music Festival, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis is not only a fantastic musician, but he's also the director of the 
festival's entire traditional music section," said Terrance Anderson, president 
of the Grand National Irish Fair. Other performers at the fair include Patrick 
Street, Paddy Noonan's Irish Cabaret, Barley Bree's Irish Showband, Paddy 
Reilly and Eileen Ivers. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Irish songs date back 2,000 years. Unlike the popular pub songs of 
today, old-style music was exclusively for the aristocracy, Doyle said. A big 
change in Irish culture occurred following the Battle of Boyne in 1692, when 
the British defeated the Gaelic forces. "The Gaelic language was outlawed," he 
said. The Gaelic music of the upper-classes was driven underground. It was 
passed on and maintained by peasants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's Irish folk music. Sometimes it's called 'hedge school' music because 
the Irish couldn't study their language or music in schools, so they secretly 
gathered along the hedges to learn," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to old-style Gaelic music, entertainment at the two-day fair 
includes storytellers, jugglers, magicians, Irish step dancing, theater 
readings, an Irish wolfhound show and the West Coast Connemara Horse Show, said 
Anderson, a Studio City resident and founding member of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be gifts and food available. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first year's attendance was about 1,500," he said. "We're looking at about 
50,000 people now -- not really surprising when you think about how many 
Americans have some Irish blood," Anderson said. "But it's more than that. The 
Irish have a joy of life that permeates the very soul. Just think about it. 
What's the one holiday that everyone celebrates? The wearing of the green -- 
St. Patrick's Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand National Irish Fair and Music Festival from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, 480 Riverside Drive, 
Burbank. Admission is $12, $7 for seniors, $4 for children 13 to 17 and free 
for children 12 and younger. For further information: (818) 509-8177. HEATHER

<TEXT>
   Here's a meaty question for students of
the Irish identity crisis: is it unchic to speak Irish?
   Bord na Gaeilge, the state language board, has published a
report suggesting that the Irish are losing respect for their
language, and with it their national identity.
   While the report names no names, the culprits aren't hard to
spot. They are Ireland's rising professionals and entrepreneurs:
the city slickers who think Irish is for yokels.
   ``They wouldn't be caught dead speaking Irish. They would think
of it as extremely uncool,'' says John Doyle, editor of In Dublin,
a trendy guide to events in the capital.
   Because Irish is spoken mainly in the rural west, ``it's
unfortunately seen as something non-urban, unsophisticated, as
something a lot of people perhaps would not like to be reminded
of,'' he said in an interview.
   Irish, or Gaelic as it is sometimes called, is the premier
official tongue and an evocative symbol of Ireland's struggle to
free itself of British rule and forge a separate identity.
   But English, the second official language, remains the
overwhelming favorite among the 3.5 million Irish, and only 5
percent to 10 percent still use Irish as their first language.
   Irish appears on pay phones, parking meters, road signs and rail
platforms. Official titles are Irish, like taoiseach (pronounced
TEE-shuck) for prime minister. Aer Lingus thanks its passengers in
Irish. In newspapers, letters to the editor often begin ``A
Chara,'' which means ``Dear Friend.''
   But usually, once the niceties are complete, English takes over.
The airline switches to English when pointing out the emergency
exits, and the letters to the editor also are in English.
   Some would say it was ever thus, given 800 years of British
rule. Douglas Hyde, the Gaelic scholar and future Irish president,
warned in 1891 that ``the Irish language is not dead but it is in a
bad state of health.''
   Now Bord na Gaeilge reports: ``Irish today, as 100 years ago,
appears to be in serious danger of disappearing as a community
language.''
   On the one hand it blames ``xenophobic nationalism and
vulgarized republicanism'' for co-opting the language to militant
anti-British causes.
   On the other extreme it chastises ``dominant elites'' in
business, the media and the professions who still regard Irish as
``a low-status `peasant' language'' and seek ``a way of escaping
from an identity of which they, perhaps, feel obscurely ashamed.''
   The result, says Bord na Gaeilge, is ``a certain emptiness in
the way Irish people now assert a sense of separate peoplehood, and
perhaps a lack of consensus over whether this is something worth
asserting at all.''
   It also sees a decline in traditional Irish accents on state
radio and TV, saying, ``many types of Hiberno-English are losing
respect in Ireland as non-Irish speech standards are increasingly
assumed among elites.''
   Some blame the government of Eamon de Valera, a founding father
of independent Ireland and zealous nationalist, which in the 1930s
made Irish an obligatory high school subject.
   No one could get a high school diploma without passing an Irish
test, and no one could join the civil service without a knowledge
of the language.
   The civil service requirement stands, as does the high school
requirement, although a passing grade is no longer required.
   ``A lot of people, when they think of the Irish language, think
of de Valera and the way Irish is rammed down their throats at
school,'' said Doyle, the In Dublin editor.
   Some experts say the preoccupation with Irish is holding back
Ireland's integration into European markets.
   Patrick Diggins, director of a Dublin teachers' center, called
in a recent speech for ``a severe jolt of realism.'' He said that
for the Irish to make their way in the European Economic Community,
``we must be fluent in at least two major European languages.''
   Some say the decline of Irish is inevitable as the struggle for
independence fades into history.
   The language, wrote Deaglan de Breadun, Irish language editor of
the Irish Times, has come to be seen ``a bit like an aunt who
seemed such an important person when you were small but now that
you are grown up you just find her amusing.''

FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: English under the kilt? - An anthology of Scottish
verse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FABER BOOK OF 20th CENTURY SCOTTISH POETRY edited by Douglas Dunn Faber
Pounds 17.50, 424 pages
THERE IS a problem about Scotland, Scots and Scottishness - that much is
undeniable. Is she a province and her culture a provincial adjunct to
English culture? Or does she possess her own proud national identity and,
along with that, a culture that somehow embodies it? Or is English now the
true - in fact, the only - language of Scotland? Is it merely an act of
emotional recidivism to claim otherwise; to assert, for example, that Gaelic
culture (there are only 80,000 Gaelic speakers in Scotland) could expect
even to exist without artificial sustenance ?
As Douglas Dunn makes clear in what must be the longest introduction to an
anthology of contemporary poetry for many a year, Scotland and her writers
have been wrestling with these sorts of problems since the Act of Union in
1707, but the arguments were brought to a particularly combative head by the
great, impassioned debate between Hugh MacDiarmid and Edwin Muir in the
1920s.
Hugh MacDiarmid (he was born CM Grieve and the assumption of the MacDiarmid
identity was coterminous with his decision to become the official
representative of the Scottish Literary Renascence), a man who could be
gentleness itself when in private company but a creature upon whom a red
mist seemed to descend when he rose to fulminate from a public platform,
held that the Scottish psyche needed to be cleansed of all English
influence; the way in which Robert Louis Stevenson had expressed the
dissimilarity between the two nations - the Scots, he said, were to be known
for 'a strong Scotch accent of the mind' - was simply not good enough. What
was needed, argued MacDiarmid, was a movement that, in building a new
national literature, would construct a national identity. And that meant the
creation of a new language: Lallans.
Unfortunately, the language that he devised was a wholly artificial one,
consisting of obsolete words culled from out-of-print dictionaries that the
inhabitants of the Lowlands merely gaped at. Could such a language as this
ever hope to underpin even a literary - let alone a political - nationalism?
MacDiarmid's philological verve, his linguistic recklessness, his pillaging
of dictionaries for the most abstruse gems imaginable, remind us of his
American counterpart, Ezra Pound - they share an eccentricity of scholarship
which, when let loose in the real world of politics, quickly moved in the
direction of a naive and exceedingly dangerous demagoguery.
Edwin Muir, on the other hand, thought English the only authentic language
for Scottish poetry; MacDiarmid and others condemned that as lese-majeste.
Their quarrel became a celebrated enmity of the kind all-too-familiar to
those who have grown up in a small house such as Scotland is.
The poetry that Dunn himself has chosen to represent the achievements of
Scotland in his century gives us, as one might expect, a whole host of
equivocal answers to these questions of theory. The voice of poetry itself
seems to say: Scotland is neither a nation nor a province. For some it is
one, and to another it is the other. And to a third group - those who exist
in the naive state of spending their lives staring at plants, animals and
other people - the problem seems not to exist at all.
There are, indeed, three languages at work here - Scots, Gaelic and English
 -and they provide us with a remarkably rich and complicated story. Gaelic
has endured and its poetry does, indeed, possess a nostalgia for a remoter
and more harsh civilisation than ours. But to deny that the poets writing in
it possess authentic voices is akin to denying the authentic thrill of
archaeological discovery. Civilisations do co-exist, one upon another; and
to see and to feel with our forebears gives back to us something of what we
were and are. But Scotland's poetry also has the capacity to be
contemporaneous and richly experimental - consider the 'Glasgow Sonnets' of
Edwin Morgan, for example; and it is also being written in Tom Leonard's
Glasgow vernacular, the real speech of genuinely uncouth people.
And if many of these poems sound at times like the lamentations of a
rootless people, is it for us - or them - to condemn a finely-crafted piece
of work on the grounds of melancholia? We may as well condemn ourselves for
being alive.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Gaelic to be encouraged in Scottish primary schools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All primary schoolchildren in Scotland would be encouraged to learn Gaelic
under plans drawn up by the SNP. The conference agreed to a range of
measures to encourage the language, which is spoken by only 70,000 people -
about 2 per cent of Scots.
Delegates agreed Gaelic should have equality with English in law and be
recognised and promoted as a national language. Bilingual workplace signs,
Gaelic road signs and a Gaelic radio station were among ideas for promoting
the language.
Mr Peter Scott-Wilson from Aberdeen said: 'Unless the language is supported
by a very firm policy it will not be encouraged, it will not grow - and we
desperately want Gaelic to grow in Scotland.'

<LEADPARA>  Queen Elizabeth II has awarded her 1990 Gold Medal for Poetry to Gaelic poet
Sorley MacLean. MacLean, 79, a former schoolmaster, lives on the Scottish
island of Skye and inspired the 20th century renaissance of Scottish Gaelic
poetry. "He has singlehandedly transformed Scottish Gaelic literature,"
Catherine Lockerbie, literary editor of the Scotsman newspaper in Edinburgh,
said after Buckingham Palace announced the award Tuesday in London.;   
MacLean translates his Gaelic poetry into English and his published work
prints the two versions on facing pages.  </LEADPARA>

   Irish athletes are being recruited with the promise of a job as
the popularity of hurling and other Gaelic sports grows in this
country, immigration officials say.
   ``The new wave of Irish immigration has brought new life to
Gaelic games in this country,'' says Frank Costello, immigration
adviser to Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and an ardent hurling fan.
   He says top young players are being recruited in Ireland with
promises of jobs. He tells of ``an entire village football squad
arriving from County Clare.''
   New York's Gaelic Athletic Association, according to past
president Terry Connaughton, now boasts 55 football teams, 16
hurling clubs and two camogie teams, a field sport for women.
   Sunday matches at Gaelic Park in New York City draw crowds of
4,000.
   A few seasons ago, two illegals, working as carpenters in the
Bronx, nipped home to help Galway defeat Kilkenny in the All
Ireland hurling championship, the Auld Sod's equivalent of the
Super Bowl.

baby-faced Chicago gangster, the petty bourgeois malt drinker and
the Dublin literary gent.''
   In the recently published ``No Laughing Matter: The Life and
Times of Flann O'Brien,'' Cronin fleshes out a profile sketched 13
years ago in ``Dead as Doornails,'' a chronicle of literary Dublin
and the alcoholic corrosion of geniuses such as O'Nolan, Brendan
Behan and Patrick Kavanagh.
   Brian O'Nolan was the real name, but Cronin put Flann O'Brien in
the title because this was the internationally famous author of a
few dazzling books: ``At-Swim-Two-Birds,'' ``The Third Policeman,''
``The Hard Life'' and ``The Dalkey Archive.''
   To his drinking companions, O'Nolan was always Myles, the
columnist who spun elaborate set-ups to puns such as ``dogging a
fled horse,'' conversed with the Plain People of Ireland and
devised the Book Handling Service to provide lovingly thumbed
volumes for the pretentious illiterate.
   Taking on the thooleramawns, gawshkogues, pultogues, thullabawns
and turnip-snaggers he detected in the body politic, na gCopaleen
once devoted the best part of a year to berating the Lord Mayor for
the stopped clock above his shop, and attacked a tourism promotion
as a plot to litter Ireland with ``the scruff and sweepings of
Britain and America.''
   To Patrick Kavanagh, he was ``that poor little na gCopaleen,'' a
genius who had just missed brilliance. O'Nolan, who sneered at
penniless bohemians and was scrupulous about buying his round,
growled about Kavanagh as ``the Monaghan toucher.''
   The times of Flann O'Brien, in Cronin's view, were dreary years
in a newly independent nation governed by politicians still
mouthing the pieties of nationalism and revolution.
   ``It was also precisely because of the official hypocrisy and
the narrowness and awfulness of the official outlook there was a
good deal of anarchism in which one could luxuriate. ... We were
`agin' everything. But everything. And we were rightly `agin'
everything,'' said Cronin, now so respectable that Prime Minister
Charles Haughey attended the publication party.
   O'Nolan's father was a British civil servant but an Irish
nationalist who spoke only Gaelic at home. O'Nolan and his brothers
were educated at home until he was 11, when he was subjected to the
bruising discipline of a Christian Brothers school in Dublin _ an
encounter that Cronin believes left lasting scars.
   ``Though they were not by any means uniformly savage, the worst
of them were scarcely human at all,'' O'Nolan wrote of his teachers
years later.
   He became a published author at age 28 with
``At-Swim-Two-Birds,'' a novel within a novel in which the
characters attempt to murder the author.
   Perhaps 250 copies were sold before stocks were wiped out by
German bombs on publishers' row in London. O'Nolan's second novel,
``The Third Policeman,'' was rejected, and there were no more Flann
O'Brien books until ``The Hard Life'' in 1961.
   O'Nolan entertained wholly unwarranted hopes that ``The Hard
Life'' would be banned in Ireland _ ``the mere name of Father Kurt
Fahrt, S.J., will justify the thunderclap,'' he told a friend.
   In 1940, O'Nolan began writing the ``Cruiskeen Lawn'' column in
The Irish Times as Myles na gCopaleen (``the g before the capital C
being the eclipsis which the genitive case demands,'' Cronin
helpfully explains), later streamlined to na Gopaleen.
   The same pseudonym was used for his only book in Gaelic, ``An
Beal Bocht'' (``The Poor Mouth''), published in 1941.
   Cronin considers ``At-Swim-Two Birds'' O'Nolan's best book, but
everyone, even the author, saw the influence of James Joyce.
   ``Joyce was a hell of a problem to him,'' Cronin said, because
Joyce had used all of O'Nolan's life material, ``the very streets
through which he walked, the institutions he attended, the kind of
people he was brought up among, the Catholic religion.''
   O'Nolan was eager to have the great exile read
``At-Swim-Two-Birds'' but dismissive when told of Joyce's praise.
   In 1954, O'Nolan organized the first Bloomsday tour of all the
places mentioned in ``Ulysses.'' And on the same day, Myles na
gCopaleen attacked Joyce as an illiterate whose ``every foreign
language quotation was incorrect.''
   The republication of ``At-Swim-Two-Birds'' in 1960 brought
O'Nolan international acclaim, but by then he had lost his job, his
columns were increasingly bitter and he was customarily sozzled for
the day by 3 p.m.
   His life story was clouded with lies _ about the number of books
he had written, about a tragically brief marriage in Germany or a
trip to Paris to visit Joyce.
   ``I found him fascinating, but then I don't separate the man
from the work in that way that other people with less sense of the
work find themselves able to do,'' said Cronin.
   ``I wasn't able to separate that feeling from being in the
physical presence of the man.''
   On his only appearance on television, in 1963, O'Nolan brusquely
refused to talk about ``At Swim-Two-Birds,'' and began expounding
on his current obsession with the notion that St. Augustine might
have been black.
   ``He was not sober,'' Cronin said, ``but this might not have
mattered except that he had half a bottle of whiskey carelessly
stuffed into the pocket of his jacket and at a certain point the
neck of this began to protrude, so we were cut off rather
hurriedly.''
   O'Nolan died on April 1, 1966. A month earlier, he wrote in his
column that anyone who ``has the courage to raise his eyes and look
sanely at the awful human condition ... must realize finally that
tiny periods of temporary release from intolerable suffering is the
most that any individual has the right to expect.''

<TEXT>
   Seosamh Mac Grianna, who adapted simple
folk tales into Irish-language stories before virtually abandoning
writing 55 years ago, has died near his boyhood home. He was 89.
   Mac Grianna died in a hospital Monday in Letterkenny in
northwest Ireland, The Irish Times reported. Cause of death was not
given.
   Mac Grianna wrote his last book, ``Mo Bhealach Fein'' (My Own
Way), in 1935. Some of his most important work, thogh, was not
published until 1969. He entered a mental hospital in 1935 for
treatment of depression and wrote little afterward.
   ``Mac Grianna sought isolation, he was ready to accept the
reputation of being eccentric and unsociable, because he sought a
vision of which he could never speak,'' wrote critic Seamus Deane
in 1940 following the publication of ``Mo Bhealach Fein,'' a partly
fictionalized autobiography.
   Mac Grianna was born Joseph Green on Jan. 15, 1901, in an
Irish-speaking community in County Donegal. His family was known
for generations as storytellers, singers and poets.
   After leaving school, he taught school briefly and was involved
in the fight for Irish independence from Britain in the early
1920s, spending time in jail before becoming a full-time writer.
   As a young man, Mac Grianna contributed to newspapers and
periodicals and wrote several novels and short stories. He also
prepared Irish translations of a dozen books, including ``Ivanhoe''
and ``Ben Hur.''
   One of his best-known works, ``An Druma Mor'' (The Big Drum),
tells of an Irish community in the 1920s wrangling over a marching
band. It was not published until 1969.
   Two years later, it was awarded the Irish-American Butler prize
and became required reading in university Irish courses.
   In recent years, Mac Grianna had appeared at literary festivals.
   Mac Grianna was the brother of Seamus O Grianna, who wrote under
the name ``Maire'' and died in 1969.
   The Irish language, often called Gaelic, is spoken frequently
now by only about 5 to 10 percent of Ireland's 3.5 million people.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>World Cup Euphoria Provides Insights into Irish Identity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Can the Irish love the English? Are they
wrapped in a Celtic shell or part of the European whole? And when
is an Irishman an Irishman?
   These are some of the intriguing issues that arise in the
euphoria sweeping Ireland over its team's performance at the World
Cup soccer tournament.
   From the prime minister to the 300,000 welcoming Irish who
filled the streets of Dublin on Sunday, from the editorials in the
press to the banter in a thousand pubs, all Irish eyes have been on
team manager Jack Charlton and his lads.
   As one huge banner across the airport highway put it, banally
but truthfully, ``Irish Eyes Are Smiling.''
   That the team's accents are more English than Irish matters
little. Nor does the fact that to Irish purists, soccer is a
foreign import. That manager Charlton is a pure-bred Englishman
does not prevent some pundits proposing he be made president of
Ireland.
   And that Ireland was knocked out in the quarterfinals does not
stop the nation behaving as though it won the cup.
   Reaching the quarterfinals, in Ireland's first appearance in the
tournament, has been reason enough to fill the streets with the
largest crowds seen in Dublin since Pope John Paul II visited in
1979.
   People stood for six hours for a glimpse of their heroes, waving
everything from Irish flags to inflatable rubber shamrocks, they
hung from trees, lampposts and the statue of Oliver Goldsmith
outside Trinity College.
   The two open-topped doubledecker buses bringing the team from
the airport needed three hours to inch through the throng, and
though the Irish came home beaten the multitudes were singing:
   ``Oh we'll really shake 'em up@ When we win the Wor-orld Cup@
Yes Ireland is the greatest football team.''
   The event cast interesting light on the myriad cultural and
linguistic strands that bind Ireland to England, its ancient foe.
   Many of the Irish players belong to English league teams and are
descendants of Irish emigrants. A couple of them claim Irish
citizenship on the strength of a single grandparent.
   The team, commented The Irish Times, ``is a mixture of
full-Irish, part-British and a variety of other races thrown in.
The manager is a full-blown Geordie'' _ from the Newcastle area of
northern England.
   But the captain, Mick McCarthy, said of the crowd Sunday, in a
broad north England accent: ``They've made us feel very, very proud
to be Irish. And despite what many people may say, every member of
this team is 110-percent Irish.''
   Irish sport can make potent politics. The Gaelic Athletic
Association, long a vehicle of Irish nationalism, has always
regarded soccer as an alien sport and still won't lend its stadiums
to soccer matches.
   But an association official, Pat Daley, acknowledged that ``a
greater degree of ecumenism is inevitable.''
   In an interview, he noted that the association's Limerick
chapter had proposed lending its ground to an Ireland-Soviet Union
soccer game.
   ``Permission wasn't forthcoming,'' he said. But the very notion
``would have been unheard of 10 years ago.''
   During the World Cup games, the association ran TV ads extolling
its sports, trying to show that the sports of hurling and Gaelic
football are more exciting than soccer. But for as long as Ireland
was in the World Cup, no sport but soccer mattered.
   ``It was the most liberating few weeks I've ever experienced in
Ireland,'' wrote columnist Nuala O Faolain in The Irish Times.
   Her paper felt the team ``brought us closer to the wider world _
including our near neighbors. They have brought about a great
boosting of national morale which is not limited by class or creed
or politics.
   ``They have shown that there is a way to be proud of being
Irish, without triumphalism or resentment toward those of other
races and traditions. They have done well for Ireland.''
   Ireland played tenacious defense in the opening matches to gain
a 1-1 tie with England, a scoreless tie with Egypt and a 1-1
deadlock with a strong Dutch team. In the second round, Ireland
defeated Romania on penalty kicks to advance to the quarterfinals,
where Italy defeated the Irish team 1-0 on Saturday.
   The big-hearted Irish gave most of their adulation not to
home-grown heroes but to Charlton, the blunt, 55-year-old former
soccer star who turned a nondescript team into one of the World
Cup's top eight.
   The aircraft bringing the team home was renamed St. Jack in his
honor, and the crowds chanted over and over, ``We Want Jack!''
   As the Irish Press commented: ``If ... as our history shows, we
have had a pretty raw deal from England over the past 800 years,
then she has made some amends by giving us Jack Charlton.''

FT  04 OCT 93 / People: Gaelic oils Cairn's finances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gaelic is not a language much used in the boardrooms, even of Scottish
companies, but the occasional word may soon be heard in the corridors of
Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based independent oil company, following the
appointment of Agnes McLeod, 33, as its new finance director.
McLeod, left, is a fluent Gaelic speaker. She joined Cairn in 1988 after
spending five years as an accountant at Lasmo, another independent oil
company.
She spent her first two years at Cairn as a financial accountant. A stint as
assistant company secretary followed, with promotion to company secretary
coming at the beginning of this year.
Her appointment trebles the ranks of women finance directors at UK oil
companies, with Liz Airey of Monument and Phoebe Wood of Arco British
leading the way.
McLeod expects to be busy in implementing the financial aspects of Cairn's
far-flung international activities in places such as Papua New Guinea and
Vietnam.
Earlier this year she played a key role in gaining shareholder approval for
Cairn's US subsidiary to issue 4m new shares for Dollars 19.7.

<TEXT>
   Three decades after the Irish
government evacuated his weeping father and the few other people
who remained on the tiny Blasket Islands, Mike Carney says the
exiles are flourishing in their landlocked new home.
   ``There's more of us here than in Ireland,'' said the happy
emigrant from the harsh life that ended abruptly in 1955 with the
closing of the islands off the western tip of the Dingle Peninsula.
   Carney, 67, is among the last surviving natives of the
five-mile-long main island that preserved 18th-century language and
customs into the middle of the 20th century, when the government
deemed the land too dangerous to inhabit.
   Now he makes his home among an estimated 50 other natives in
Springfield's Hungry Hill district.
   In Ireland, they ``lived in a pre-capitalist society in some of
the most treacherous waters of Western Europe,'' said Thomas Biuso,
an English professor at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, N.H.
   On Thursday, Carney plans to join other islanders for the city's
St. Patrick's Day parade and a drink at the John Boyle O'Reilly
Club, a far cry from the celebrations of his youth on the
westernmost point of Europe.
   ``Here there is more of a parade. It's more show-off here,'' he
said. ``Back there we would go pick a shamrock in the fields to
wear in green caps. If we could, we would go to the mainland to
watch the horse races.''
   Getting to the mainland three miles away in handmade canoes was
always precarious because of often-threatening weather, which
seemed to worsen by the mid-1900s, Carney said.
   Bad weather kept his family from bringing his brother's body to
the mainland for burial for three days after his death in the
winter of 1947. Neither a doctor nor a priest could be summoned
because of the storm.
   The islands apparently were too remote even for a bull brought
from the mainland for breeding. The bull swam the three miles home,
Carney said.
   The island's remoteness, however, ensured the preservation there
of an ancient social organization, which included a king and a
council of elders, and of the Gaelic tongue. Carney said
Gaelic-speaking mainlanders have difficulty understanding islanders
``because we speak so fast.''
   No one knows when the first mainlanders settled on the Blaskets
or when the islanders began emigrating to the United States, but
Biuso said they apparently left in the mid-1800s to work on the
railroad running through Massachusetts.
   Carney's father went to the United States three times but always
returned. ``I guess he got homesick,'' Carney said.
   Carney was 16 when he left for Dublin, where he worked as a
bartender for 10 years before coming to Springfield.
   ``I could not see myself battling the Atlantic Ocean for a
living,'' he said. ``You could be captive on the island for a month
without being able to go to the mainland to get food. It looks
beautiful, yes, but to operate there, that's a different story,
battling 20, 25 foot waves in those little boats.''
   By then the Blaskets' population, which had numbered 176 people
at its peak, had fallen to a few dozen.
   ``We had more relatives in Springfield than we had back in the
Blaskets,'' Carney said.
   His brother, Paddy, said: ``We were like wild geese following
after each other. There was nothing left for us, but we were all
lonesome leaving. I don't think anyone really wanted to go.''
   The government, fearing for the safety of the island's aging
population, took the last islanders off in 1955 and gave them
houses on the mainland, some within sight of the island.
   ``My father cried when he left,'' Carney said.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Old craft in a modern setting -
Nick Garnett visits Brian Stack, who combines his culture with his business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DINGLE Peninsula is the western terminus of Europe, the final outpost
before you fall into the Gulf Stream. On a sunny day in April, the water is
pastel blue and the Brandon mountains are capped in snow. An ordnance survey
map reveals the strata of primitive cultures that once took root here: the
weird beehive huts of early Christian hermits; the monastic life exposed by
the lonely Gallarus oratory shaped like an upturned boat; the crooked Ogham
stones of the late Iron Age on which the Celts chiselled a simple structure
of angled lines as a written script.
The area around the coastal town of Dingle is also a gaeltacht. It is one of
10 or so parcels of land in Ireland where the populations encapsulate a
significant proportion of fluent Gaelic speakers. Special attention is cast
on them, with the help of a Udaras (Gaelic for 'authority'), whose task
includes funnelling cash to businesses.
The regional manager for the Udaras in Dingle, Steve O Culain, says it is
illegal to discriminate against businesses run by non-Gaelic speakers, but
the Udaras clearly prefers using money in a way that bolsters Ireland's
ancient language.
One tiny company benefiting from operating in a gaeltacht is that of Brian
Stack, jewellery-maker and jewellery-seller. But he benefits more from
operating in a beautiful area popular with tourists. Visitors account for 65
per cent of Stack's total yearly sales of Pounds 180,000, largely because
the 40-year-old has piggy-backed his business on two local attractions.
One is the artefacts left by the Celts, such as the Ogham stones, high
crosses and metalware.
'A lot of the interlace work in the seventh and eighth centuries was
incredible,' says Stack. 'There is a theory that these workmen had proper
workshops and a type of college system to learn crafts in gold, silver and
stone.'
Stack and his workshop reproduce miniature examples of Celtic art in gold
and silver.
The other attraction is Fungie, a dolphin which popped up in the sea off
Dingle five years ago and has stayed ever since. Fungie has become an
attraction for tourists, who also like Stack's gold and silver facsimiles of
the cute cetacean.
Stack did a seven-year jeweller's apprenticeship in Cork before working in
Canada and building his own house in Dingle. He rented his first shop in
Dingle in 1981, opened another outside the peninsula in the tourist haunt of
Killarney, and then a workshop in Dingle. He has just moved the workshop to
a new, larger building, with a shop attached, provided by the Udaras.
About half the jewellery Stack sells is bought from other jewellery-makers,
though he expects this proportion to drop. 'The margin on made-up jewellery
we buy is about 100 per cent and a little more on the things we make, say,
130 per cent,' he says.
The workshop and three retail outlets generated a profit last year of
between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000. Stack employs three in the shops
(and gets occasional help from his wife, Mairead, a teacher) and four
apprentices. Training grants from the Udaras cover 60 per cent of
apprentices' wages for the first year, and after that on a declining scale.
The Udaras also forks out for 60 per cent of capital equipment. This
includes Pounds 20,000 of casting machinery, bought because the economics of
jewellery-making work against handcrafting.
Much of Stack's own jewellery is handmade: gold and silver bent, soldered,
cut and punched into shape. To lower the costs, more jewellery will now be
made by casting. The rubber cast is taken by a handmade design, and wax
injected into it. The wax pieces are fixed to a common stem and plaster is
poured around that. The wax is removed by steam, and silver or gold poured
into the mould - aA vacuum system sucks the metal into the mould's furthest
corners.
There is plenty of space for all this in the 155 sq metre premises, whose
subsidised rent is about Pounds 1,200 a year, rising eventually to an
unsubsidised rent of about Pounds 3,000. The casting equipment comes from
the Isle of Wight, precious metal from Johnson Matthey in Dublin, and
gemstones from London and Switzerland.
Some of Stack's headaches are familiar to most owners of small businesses.
'We have built up gradually over ten years, which is a good thing, but my
biggest problem is I never got management training of any description. That
would have helped with things like controlling stock, forward planning, and
understanding how to foresee demand.'
Seasonal demand and the need to build up stocks every year for the summer
tourist sales hurts cash flow.
'By the beginning of the next season, you are in a tight squeeze on that.
We'll be producing more with the casting machines, so to counteract these
new cash flow pressures we intend to take on work for other jewellers.'
He intends reducing the number of different items the company makes. Stack
uses a Pounds 20,000 overdraft from Allied Irish Bank.
The troubles in the North still have a debilitating effect on tourism, and
remain, for businessmen like Stack, a source of annoyance and bewilderment.
'It's the great tragedy of Ireland. It hampers everything, shifting all
development right down the line. It's such a mess.'
Like most of his fellow countrymen, Stack harbours a relatively genial
disposition on life. 'I've been very lucky, thanks be to God.'

   Ireland cast aside its economic woes and
the latest violence in Ulster to stage its biggest ever St.
Patrick's Day parade Thursday, celebrating the Irish patron saint
as well as the capital's 1,000th birthday.
   A record crowd of 300,000 people, including thousands of
American tourists, thronged the three-mile parade route from St.
Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street, the main thoroughfare.
   Many adorned their lapels with sprigs of shamrock, the wild
clover that is Ireland's national emblem.
   About 6,000 people took part in the parade of dancers, marching
bands and historic-theme floats. Skies were overcast but the rain
held off.
   March 14-20 was designated St. Patrick's Week in honor of
Ireland's patron saint and Dublin's millennium celebrations, with
daily displays of Irish folk music, dance and street theater.
   In Northern Ireland, St. Patrick's Day celebrations were heavily
overshadowed by Wednesday's outbreak of sectarian violence, when a
Protestant gunman shot and threw grenades at Catholic mourners
burying three Irish Republican Army guerrillas in Belfast. Three
people died and 68 were wounded.
   Mourners wearing shamrocks and green armbands attended the
funeral Thursday of a slain IRA guerrilla a day after the bloodbath
at Milltown Cemetery. The service was peaceful.
   The violence had little visible impact on the Dublin parade. It
was a day to set aside thoughts of an unemployment rate near 18
percent, high taxation and an emigration outflow estimated at
30,000 a year.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey reviewed the parade from a stand
outside the General Post Office where rebels launched the Easter
Rising of 1916 against British rule.
   Organizers said crews from more than 80 TV stations in the
United States and Canada photographed the parade.
   Government offices, schools, banks and most businesses were
closed in the south, but many industries, offices and department
stores stayed open in Northern Ireland, where the majority is
Protestant and doesn't regard St. Patrick's Day as a national
holiday.
   The Irish also took a somewhat bemused look at how the United
States celebrates March 17.
   ``There's a bar in West 39th Street that is advertising live
leprechauns and bagpipe music tonight. ... There's even a Jewish
delicatessen on 47th Street offering Irish bagels,'' marveled the
Irish Times correspondent in New York, Eugene McEldowney.
   In Dublin, botanist Charles Nelson remarked: ``We tend to think
of the Americans as being a bit eccentric in this regard.''
   Some U.S. customs seemed to be catching on here. An American
hamburger chain was selling ``shamrock-flavored'' shakes.
   Roman Catholic churches were full for morning Mass, and later
the pubs filled up for celebrations.
   Some Irish newspapers marked the day by editorializing about it
in Irish, or Gaelic, which is the country's first official
language, although only a minority are fluent in it.
   The Irish Independent, editorializing in English, wondered what
St. Patrick, the 5th century missionary who Christianized Ireland,
would think of the country were he to return.
   ``As a missionary he would have to come to the conclusion that
the faith he worked so hard to spread here has come on bad times.
There are plenty of churches but they are not always packed. There
are many people who call themselves Christian but may not be
entitled to do so,'' it said.
   And if he went to Northern Ireland where he lived as a young
man, ``what would he make of the violence, hate and bigotry?'' the
paper asked.
   But it also noted that he would find a worldwide Irish diaspora
who ``carried with them into exile an attitude to life which was
fashioned basically by what Patrick taught our ancestors 1,500
years ago. That is a plus.''

FT  27 AUG 94 / Private View: The oral culture of an Irish fast talker -
Michael D. Higgins is Ireland's first minister of culture. He tells
Christian Tyler what he is doing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's first-ever minister of culture is short, flamboyant and prickly.
He walks with slow, stiff self-importance but talks so fast that he must be
getting paid by the word.
Though a poet by inclination and an academic by profession, Michael D.
Higgins (the D is for Daniel) has a reputation for making things happen. As
Minister for Arts, Culture and the Irish language - 'with responsibility for
broadcasting, heritage and waterways', he added quickly - he has resurrected
the Irish film industry. Twelve films were made last year and there could be
even more this. Since his cabinet post was created in January 1993, a
sprinkling of Oscar and Grammy awards, not to mention a Booker Prize, have
added lustre to his halo.
An arts minister's job is easy to describe. He allocates subsidies and tax
concessions. But what is a ministry of culture - that is, outside a
totalitarian state?
When a company builds itself a gleaming skyscraper, they say it is time to
mark down the shares. When Ireland, historically one of the world's leading
exporters of culture, sets up a separately funded ministry should that be
interpreted as a sign of vigour, or of competitive weakness?
Like most politicians, Michael Higgins regards questions as opportunities
for a big speech. But, thinner-skinned than most, he treated my dissenting
questions almost as a personal affront. When things were going his way, he
was pinkly, almost flirtatiously enthusiastic. When crossed he turned an
angry, trembling white.
His central doctrine is something he calls The Cultural Space. 'I aim to put
works of imagination and creativity at the centre of things,' he said.
'Culture used to be seen as peripheral, dependent on economic growth. I have
challenged that and my thinking is beginning to prevail.'
It is a fine-sounding phrase, I said, but what is a cultural space?
'I was just going to explain it to you. It has to to with a theory of
culture that is democratic, participatory and inclusive. It is also one that
views culture as energising and positive. It's quite the opposite of the
theory of culture that is exclusive or elitist or residual or
concessionary.'
My heart sank.
Higgins continued: 'There is no need to say that because a person has lost a
job that they have lost their rights of cultural participation as well. If
you allow the cultural space to collapse you will get racism, anti-immigrant
feeling, alienation and so forth.
'This space is full of intellectual products based on imagination that could
re-energise the economic space.'
I detected a gap and jumped for it. Is this a complicated way of saying that
people will not be working in steel mills, farms or coal mines any longer
but in tourism or television?
'There's more to it than that.'
At this point an aide appeared to say that a radio interviewer was on the
telephone. The minister apologised, got up from the sofa and went to his
desk where, for 10 minutes or more, he poured a stream of words down the
line. In spite of the interruption, I felt sorry for the interviewer.
When Higgins returned I asked him if he was really another minister for
employment, but specialising in the leisure industries. He talked about
European unemployment and 'a lack of originality in intellectual structures
 -clapped-out thinking'.
We were coming down to earth. Better still, Higgins - who is after all, a
member of a left-wing government - began to drop clues about his political
feelings.
'People have wanted these things in little boxes. There is a view of society
that when economies go well shouldn't we go to the theatre once a year? And
people from a particular section of the social classes dressed up, they had
a little outing and they encountered culture, and went home.'
Do you come from the cultured classes yourself?
'No. I come from a very poor family. My father died in a poor house. But I
would argue for my father's culture in terms of his generosity of spirit in
being part of the Irish war of independence, his solidarity, the things that
he suffered. My mother, while poor, always had an interest in reading. The
house was full of books, and we had nothing else.'
Higgins was born in Limerick, in the west of Ireland, and at times one may
catch a Gaelic intonation (he both speaks and writes Irish) in the high,
sibilant voice. He was brought up in County Clare by an aunt and uncle when
his father fell ill. An academic career which has spanned English
literature, sociology, political science and economics took him from Galway,
to Indiana, to Manchester and Illinois. Higgins likes to remind his hearer
that he knows a few things.
I returned to the fray. Is this really an economic department with modern
art on the walls?
'It is a department of culture. It is a department that contributes
innovatively to the economic space of this country. We have created jobs.
'As to which are we, we never ask that question. I never ask that question.
I have a pre-Cartesian view of it. I live in my mind at a time before
compartmentalisation. I despise compartmentalisation.
Are you breaking even here?
'I'm in massive surplus.'
Having relaunched the film industry, Higgins is about to reorganise the
music business. He is studying interactive communications technology,
restoring canalboats and protecting wrecks. He wants to set up an
all-Ireland television channel for Gaelic-speakers and a European satellite
channel to show native Europrogrammes.
You may be able to create jobs by means of tax incentives, I said, but what
else can a minister of culture do?
Higgins yelped. 'I think that's a pathetic view of a minister of culture.'
How can you minister for culture? It's a contradiction in terms.
'Well, that is only a middle-class riddle. Now I agree that what I am doing
is controversial. I am not saying for example that everyone is a Picasso.
But I am saying that everyone has creativity, that is socially negotiated
and if I define . . .'
What on earth does socially negotiated mean?
'Yes. I can put it simply. If I lift my hand am I threatening you or giving
you a gesture of affection? You rely on the symbol that is involved. We
exchange symbols.
'But what a pathetic collapse it was to suggest that only people who had
come from a certain school background, standing in front of a picture, had
access to the appropriate symbols to make a literate comment . . . That kind
of nonsense was anti-democratic, destroyed general culture and if you read
Raymond Williams (the literary critic) you will see that it excluded, even
in Britain, the wonderful storytelling tradition and whatever.'
The minister was working himself into a rhetorical rage. But his mention of
storytelling was an opening. There is a caricature of the Irishman, I said -
and it is probably an Irish invention - which sees every man in a pub as an
Oscar Wilde in waiting. All you have to do is write down what he's saying
and you have literature. Was this what he meant by developing the cultural
space? If so, it sounded Utopian.
Higgins's exasperation was not feigned now. 'To whom does it sound Utopian?
We can't have the conversation if you ask questions to which you've already
given answers. Utopian to whom? You make statements in the question that you
put.
'Let me put it the other way to you. Do you want to continue with
traditional economic views, and just every now and again throw up your hands
quasi-politely and say 'isn't it a pity about unemployment?' Or are you
going to say 'maybe it is the economic model that has defects?''
Higgins refuses to accept that Ireland - or Europe - must eventually lose
the media market battle to US television and film makers. But he is not a
cultural protectionist, he insists. He will retaliate by encouraging Irish
talent to put rival 'product' into the market. In the same spirit, he sees
it as a proper government function to try and save the Irish language
against vastly superior market forces - in this case English.
'The market is an instrument that can be used for policy purposes, but the
market became an ideology. We do not live by the market alone.
'What I'm saying is you take the different components of the society,
including the cultural space and you draw from that and make it rich, so
that when you come to the marketplace you're neither frightened by it, nor
are you disabled from using it as a tool.
'What is really important is the quality of the total space. That's the area
I will go into when I finish.' It sounded like some post-modernist version
of Paradise.
If you lost office would you become a consultant?
'No, I'd probably go back to writing. I miss writing very, very much.'
You're not a businessman manque?
'No, though I know how to do it. I see so many missed opportunities. I
believe it is only narrow thinking and bureaucracy that is stopping us doing
wonderful things.'
The minister was restored to good humour. As I left the Ministry of Culture,
past a peat-and-bone sculpture hanging on the lobby wall, I thought: if
economic miracles could be talked into being, Michael D. Higgins would be
your man.

   An exodus from Ireland over the past decade has
left tens of thousands of Irish men and women in the United States
without legal status. While most of the illegals congregate in
cities such as Boston and New York, an underground railway of
priests, nuns, pub keepers and others is helping them find refuge
all across the country.

<TEXT>
   Call them the illegal Irish, the undocumented
Irish, the out-of-status Irish or the just plain new Irish.
   But call them if there's a job or an apartment available, begs
Sister Veronica Dobson, who came here 30 years ago from County
Carlow to work among Mexicans crossing the border into Texas and
now runs an outreach program for Irish immigrants in Boston.
   ``And please call,'' she adds, ``if there's a stick of furniture
available'' for them to start a new life.
   Nobody knows for sure how many Irish between the ages of 17 and
30 have unlawfully overstayed their visas in the United States in
the past eight or nine years since the Irish economy went sour.
Estimates range from 60,000 to 150,000. They live haunted by the
fear, often exaggerated but real enough, of being turned over to
immigration authorities.
   But they're not always unwelcome.
   ``They're handy at carpentry and bricklaying so landlords and
the neighbors like having them around,'' says the Rev. Gerard
Burns, whose bishop in Galway sent him to the Dorchester section of
Boston with the ``rather vague assignment of visiting the bars, the
hurling grounds and dance halls'' to minister to a runaway Irish
flock.
   As it was in the flight from the potato famine nearly a century
and a half ago, Boston or New York is their first safe harbor, but
an underground railway of priests, nuns, pub keepers, lawyers, even
congressmen and aldermen, is helping them find refuge in ports of
call from Galveston, Texas, to San Francisco.
   A congressman from Boston's Dorchester section, Brian Donnelly,
D-Mass., has become a household word in Ireland _ ``as well-known
as the pope or John F. Kennedy,'' says Irish Consul General Liam
Canniffe _ for sponsoring the Donnelly visa that since 1986 has
helped thousands immigrate from 36 mostly European countries. Of
the 15,000 Donnelly visas granted last year on a lottery basis,
Ireland won an astounding 12,000.
   Last St. Patrick's Day, 900 Irish men and women seeking legal
status attended a visa clinic in Dorchester, and hundreds more
lined up for applications at a ballroom in New York City's Woodside
area, another haven for the new Irish.
   The exodus of young people in the past decade has so depopulated
parts of western Ireland, where the unemployment rate is nearly 50
percent, that parish priests in rural Mayo and Galway ``can't put
together a dance,'' as Burns puts it. The Gaelic football team in
Waterville disbanded for lack of a 15-man starting lineup.
   Meanwhile, bars like Cuchulainns, the Emerald Isle and the
Blarney Stone on Dorchester Avenue and hundreds more from Boston to
Baltimore, import bands such as ``The Dingle Spike'' and ``T.F.
Much'' from Ireland for the packed weekend dances. ``Many Young Men
of 20 Said Goodbye,'' the theme song of the new wave of
immigration, dampens many an eye.
   ``The newcomers gave the kiss of life to Gaelic games in this
country,'' avows the Rev. Martin Keaveny, who was the first priest
sent over by the Irish bishops to work as a chaplain among the
illegals at the urging of Cardinal John O'Connor. Making the rounds
of their homes, playing fields and bars along ``the Irish mile'' in
the Bainbridge section of the Bronx in New York, he often runs into
young people from his parish back in Mayo.
   Monday night, when video tapes of Sunday's hurling and football
matches are flown in from Ireland, is prime time for pastoral pub
crawling.
   ``The big provincial championships and All-Ireland finals are
brought in live by satellite at 20 (dollars) a ticket,'' Keaveny
says. ``Sports and the church are the two anchors linking them to
home.''
   ``I could sit all day in St. Ambrose's rectory across the street
and no one would call,'' says Burns, sitting at a back table at
Cuchulainns near a poster announcing ``Irish daily and provincial
newspapers on sale every Tuesday'' and a bulletin board papered
with pleas for jobs and apartments. ``You got to go where the
people are.''
   ``And the bar is where they are,'' agrees innkeeper Kieran
Staunton, a legal immigrant from Mayo. ``The bar is their bank,
their employment agency, their apartment finder, their social club,
as well as the cure for loneliness.''
   The ``undocumented Irish,'' as he prefers to call them, are
reluctant to open bank accounts for fear of having their bogus
Social Security numbers exposed and their funds confiscated by the
authorities.
   ``They pay cash for everything, even tools or a used truck
needed on the job. They can't go into business for themselves
without a credit rating,'' Staunton says. ``There's no building a
future not knowing from one day to the next if you'll be deported.
They can't even join a union, which is shocking when you consider
that the secret organizations like the Molly Maguires built the
union movement in this country.''

   Roman Catholic Cardinal Tomas
O'Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an ardent Irish
nationalist, died Tuesday after falling ill on a pilgrimage to
Lourdes, France, the church announced. He was 66.
   The cardinal, who was head of the church in both the Republic of
Ireland and Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, died of cardiac
arrest in a hospital at Toulouse, 95 miles from Lourdes, officials
said.
   An announcement of the death, issued by the church's press
office in both Belfast and Dublin, said O'Fiaich had appeared
unwell to doctors accompanying the group of 600 pilgrims from his
seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland.
   Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where a peasant girl reported a
vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858. Miraculous cures have been
reported there.
   The cardinal was admitted first to hospital in Lourdes, then
flown by helicopter to Toulouse. Philippe Giovanni, director of the
Rangueil Hospital there, said O'Fiaich died of a ``brutal cardiac
arrest'' soon after being admitted.
   While calling for a unified Ireland and criticizing British
policy in Northern Ireland, O'Fiaich, whose name was pronounced
O'Fee, also castigated the violence of the Irish Republican Army.
   The predominantly Catholic outlawed guerrilla army seeks to end
British rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish
Republic.
   ``You can't unite people with bombs and bullets,'' the cardinal
once said.
   He was appointed spiritual leader of Ireland's 4 million
Catholics in in 1977. Two years later Pope John Paul II made
O'Fiaich one of the first cardinals of his papacy.
   Tributes to O'Fiaich poured in from some both sides of the Irish
border.
   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said he was
``devastated, ... deeply grieved.''
   Britain's top official in Northern Ireland also expressed
sadness. ``We did not always agree about everything, but he treated
me with the greatest possible courtesy, friendliness and warmth,''
said Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke.
   However, the Rev. Martin Smyth, a legislator in the British
Parliament for the Ulster Unionists, said his party hoped
O'Fiaich's death will give Catholics ``a more positive spritual
leadership and a less Republican stance.''
   In Belfast, Ulster Television suspended scheduled programs for
an hour and aired a religious program and a news program about the
cardinal.
   O'Fiaich was born Thomas Fee in Cullyhanna, in south Armagh,
within sight of the border with the Irish Republic. He changed his
name to the Gaelic form as his love of the Irish language and
nationalist sentiments developed.
   O'Fiaich retained close ties to Armagh, which has been dubbed
``bandit country'' because of the IRA activity.
   From the time he became primate, he spoke publicly of his wishes
for a united Ireland. He visited IRA guerrillas in jail, called the
British Army's fatal shooting of an Irish civilian murder, and said
the border dividing Ireland was ``unnatural.''

against the Protestants of Northern Ireland.''
   He claimed O Fiaich had ``made an outrageous statement that the

FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: Strangers in a strange land of wonderment - FT
Children's Book of the Month / A fruitful novel of imaginative tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR FROM SKYE by Judith O'Neill Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 204 pages
THE GUYANESE poet John Agard once called the interior of his own country 'a
hinterland of wonder'. What he was trying to express by that evocative turn
of phrase was the imaginative implications of having been born in a place
that consists of a narrow coastal littoral, relatively easily and quickly
tamed by all the marvellous resources that human beings seem to have at
their disposal and, at its back, an untamed and inhospitable interior -
rainforest, mountains, impenetrable jungle.
Agard would argue that such contrasting physical features are an imaginative
resource whose value and importance to the writer are inestimable. All he or
she knows is that it is there, within and without, that other world at one's
back, just as surely as those forces of unreason that make war upon our own
sense of order and propriety, just as certainly as the id is locked in
perpetual combat with the superego.
Australia is such another place, a world where the sophisticated society of
Sydney rubs shoulders with a timeless Aboriginal heritage, and that friction
has helped to nurture a crop of remarkable children's novelists over the
past 30 years.
These include Ivan Southall, known for his compelling and often
intellectually demanding adventure stories set in the Australian outback;
Patricia Wrightson, whose books have included successful experiments in
science fiction and fantasy; and, among a younger generation of authors,
Judith O'Neill, whose novels for older readers have included Deepwater, the
story of a young girl growing up in a small, tightly-knit community that is
riven by jealousy.
All these writers show an awareness of that fruitful imaginative tension
between outback and coast; between the claims of the Aboriginal and the
often rapacious demands of the civilising settler.
In Judith O'Neill's case, the story is given an extra twist by the fact that
her great-great-grandfather, a shepherd and crofter, originally came from
the Isle of Skye, and emigrated with his family to the new Colony of
Victoria in 1852. This is the seed from which her new historical novel, So
Far From Skye, a fictional account of the dispossession of the hundreds of
Gaelic-speaking families that were obliged to emigrate to Australia in the
1850s, has grown.
To the people themselves, the terrible sequence of calamities in those years
must have seemed like a re-enactment of the Book of Job itself: the blight
(which destroyed the potato crop); famine; cholera; and then the Highland
clearances themselves.
The book centres on the fate of the crofter Donald MacDonald (the name of
Judith O'Neill's own relative) from Taliskar, an upright, God-fearing man of
the Free Church, and his young family, but we experience it mainly through
the eyes of Morag, his courageous and resourceful 13-year-old daughter.
First comes the terrible walk to Portree, with the father carrying his
beloved foot-plough and, at his waist, a pouch of black earth from his
native village as a talisman. The ship itself, the Georgiana, is to sail
from Greenock, and it is there that the family comes upon and adopts the
ailing baby of a long-lost cousin who is dying of consumption.
On board ship, they are presented with gifts from the Emigration Society - a
suit of warm clothes, a Gaelic song book and, most important of all, a large
pair of black scissors for shearing off waist-long beards and tangled mops
of filthy hair. The message is simple: the savages are to be humanised,
first by the crudest of physical means, and later by teaching them the
Queen's own English.
The three-month voyage is a terrible experience: days of unbearable sickness
in which the families lie curled in their cramped berths, gripped by the
twin miseries of leaving home and fear of the sea. The captain, a relatively
enlightened man, recommends dancing as a cure for melancholia. Towards the
journeys' end the mood is lightened by an all-night ceilidh in which the old
tales are retold and Alec Matheson rouses the party to a frenzy by scraping
on his fiddle.
Morag is astonished to arrive on a balmy October spring day, with the air
full of the scent of eucalyptus. This is not the soft, misty beauty of her
own beloved Skye but a starker beauty, all brilliant colours and strong
light. The final tragedy occurs when the families are divided up as if they
were the spoils of war, but at the novel's close the Donald MacDonalds are
beginning to refind a sense of themselves in their new home, and Morag
discovers in Kal-Kal an Aboriginal friend with whom she has much in common -
a strange language; old, compelling stories; and a terrible tale of
dispossession . . .
The historical novel, whether written for adults or children, has a poor
reputation for improbable dialogue, stuffed with ridiculously anachronistic
speech, inauthentic details, an unacceptable level of violence done to
historical truth. Judith O'Neill has made no attempt to reproduce the quaint
speech of her forebears. She has researched her material thoroughly and
shaped it into a plain, convincing narrative that all good readers of ten
and above will find both absorbing and highly enjoyable.

One of the pleasures of 1993 so far has been The Sexual Imperative (C4,
9.00) which tonight looks at the different strategems within the animal
kingdom for rearing one's young. None is more bizarre than that of human
society in which sexually mature young are discouraged from getting on with
the business for such a long period.
The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15) has boldly decided to go to Scotland once a
month. Its opening programme from Glasgow asks pundits to assess the impact
of the Gaelic Television Fund on TV North of The Border. Created by the
government with Pounds 9.5m, the fund has been asked to treble the gaelic
output.
There is only one prison in Luxembourg and it is profiled tonight in that
first-rate series, The Essential History of Europe (BBC 2, 8.00). Are the
affluent Luxembourgois so happy, or does the fact that one third of those in
jug are there for drug-related offences signal a certain malaise?
The Trouble with Medicine (BBC 2, 9.30) regularly overdoes the foreign
angle. Tonight we see how Americans, Irish, and Indians deal with old people
(as they used to be known in less mealy-mouthed times).

Gaelic New Age music? Hmmm, an interesting idea. Fraser and Machlis have 
composed and adapted some traditional-sounding Irish themes into a very 
untraditional format. Fraser's fiddle playing, rich in ornamental twists and 
turns, is juxtaposed against the strikingly contemporary settings created by 
Machlis' piano and synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
The results, even in pieces like the sprightly "Cowboy Jig," are fascinating -- 
a convincing interface between old and new. At its best -- "Bovaglie's Plaid" 
is a stirring example -- the blend of synthesizer and fiddle will bring 
passionate tears to the hearts of the most hidebound traditionalists. DON

<TEXT>
   How fares the shamrock this St. Patrick's
Day?
   Just fine, says botanist Charles Nelson, whose desk is cluttered
with samples from all over the country.
   The sprigs of green have been arriving in response to an appeal
by Nelson, who is conducting the first survey of the state of
Ireland's national plant in nearly a century.
   His timing is perfect, since Thursday is St. Patrick's Day, when
Irish minds turn to the ``chosen leaf of bard and chief, Old Erin's
native Shamrock'' and men, women and children adorn their lapels
with a sprig picked from garden, roadside or local supermarket.
   But the shamrock's life is as fleeting as a ray of sunshine in
the Irish rain, and by the end of Thursday's St. Patrick's Day
parade through Dublin the streets will be littered with wilted
shamrock.
   Myths galore surround the three-leafed weed.
   St. Patrick is supposed to have used the three leaves to explain
the Holy Trinity to a Gaelic chieftain. In the 18th century the
Irish establishment accepted it as a national symbol, like the
Welsh leek, Scottish thistle and English rose.
   It was later adopted as a symbol of defiance in the fight for
Ireland's independence from Britain.
   ``Viva la, the rose shall fade, And the shamrock shine for ever
new!'' sang Thomas Davis, the 19th-century rebel bard.
   Today the shamrock emblem adorns everything from the national
airline to bags of peat moss fertilizer.
   But what exactly is the shamrock?
   In 1893, Dublin legal clerk Nathaniel Colgan set out to
catalogue all the species, and concluded there were four main kinds.
   Nelson concludes the shamrock is merely a humble clover too
often dressed up in ``colorful legend and sentimental nonsense.''
The word shamrock derives from Seamrog, Irish for ``little
clover,'' he said.
   Nelson held up two plastic bags of shamrock. One, sent to him
from County Down in Northern Ireland, had large-leafed shamrocks.
The other, from County Wicklow in the south, had much smaller,
darker leaves.
   ``This one is shamrock because the person who collected it
believed it to be shamrock, and I accept that. And the same goes
for the other one too,'' he said in an interview.
   ``It's a matter of a rose by any other name smelling just as
sweet. A shamrock is what a person believes is shamrock,'' he said,
adding:
   ``Botanically the plants used as shamrock are in fact clover.
But if you tell an Irishman that he's wearing clover, not shamrock,
he will feel insulted.''
   Tom Coleman, who markets shamrock souvenirs, has his own
definition: ``You know it when you see it.''
   Coleman's factory 100 miles south of Dublin, turns out 300,000
souvenirs a year, from key rings to ornamental plates, all
decorated with real shamrock preserved by a secret formula.
   ``We have a shamrock here that's 17 years old and still green,''
he said.
   Nelson said there was no basis for the story about St. Patrick
and the shamrock, saying that only in 1650, more than 1,000 years
after the patron saint of Ireland lived, was the shamrock first
recorded as being something more than an weed.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (10): Investors get good terms - Angela
Long at the movies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To call the whole country 'Paddywood' is stretching language, but over the
past year there has been a mini-boom in film production in Ireland.
In April some 12 films were in production. Six more were about to start
filming. A London newspaper went slightly wild recently, predicting that
Ireland could become Europe's main site for film production.
Mr Michael Dwyer, film critic of the Irish Times, points out that ever since
1928, when Alfred Hitchcock made Juno and the Paycock in Dublin, Ireland's
rapidly changing light and slowly changing landscape have been irresistible
to directors seeking not just nostalgia but authenticity. What is more, the
1993 Finance Act gives a three-year tax relief on whatever proportion of a
film's investment is Irish, up to IPounds 1m. More recently, the government
has again tinkered with financial incentives, while insisting that share
capital with a minimum three-year payback should be the baseline source of
funds.
Companies such as Farrell Grant Sparks, Dublin accountants (FGS), have taken
advantage of the favourable terms for film investment. FGS has set up a film
production company, which raised IPounds 2m within two weeks. Mr Richard Fox
of FGS says the company, which 'met investor demand for a tax shelter before
the year-end cut-off for individuals on April 5', is now looking for a
project. 'I'd say that, judging by the success of this venture, we would
look at similar ones in the future.'
Internationally, Irish films have a high profile at present, following
American interest in In the Name of the Father, directed by Jim Sheridan,
and last year's Crying Game by Neil Jordan. The prominence of Daniel Day
Lewis, who also starred in Sheridan's previous big success, My Left Foot,
has also called attention to the Irish product.
It should be no surprise if the Irish were to make a success of the film
industry, at least at the creative level. Their seanachai (storytellers) of
old possessed the wild imagination and verbal creativity which later
surfaced in the work of Swift, Beckett and Joyce. Today Ireland is top in
the whole of western Europe for per capita cinema attendance.
In Dublin, the Irish Film Centre, with smart premises in a former Quaker
meeting house in Eustace Street, in the centre of town, attracted 16,000
members in 1993, its first full year of operation. Squabbles about
management and financing spoil its image slightly, but, with several film
development and production companies located in its premises, the IFC
provides an attractive focus for the film buff in the national capital.
So far, most films for main release made in Ireland have tended to be modest
in budget compared to the big spending on Jurassic Park and its lavishly
produced kindred. Yet the success of, for example, Into the West, made by
Dubliner Gabriel Byrne, has shown that there is a market for the 'small'
picture.
'The Irish industry is never going to make Terminator 3, but our films will
always be story-driven - smaller films costing IPounds 3m to IPounds 5m,'
says Mr James Flynn, submissions manager at the Irish Film Board, based in
Galway.
The film board (Bord Scannan in Gaelic) has been receiving about 30 formal
applications for funding each month since it was revived in 1992. This, says
Mr Flynn, is on top of less formal approaches from a wide range of
film-makers.
The government has also been launching initiatives to create the right sort
of skilled labour for film production. Mr Michael Higgins, minister for
arts, announced a 'comprehensive training programme for the film industry'
last October. His department was looking for EU structural funds to assist
the programme, which he said aimed to raise standards in the complete range
of film skills.
While the future for features looks rosy (provided they get a better
critical reception than the recently-released Widow's Peak - despite the
talents of Mia Farrow, Jim Broadbent and Natasha Richardson), the animation
sector has not lived up to its promise of five years ago. After An American
Tail, a charming full-length feature which failed to ignite the box office
in the Aladdin mode, the animation company mainly responsible, Sullivan
Bluth, went bankrupt. The shell of the company was subsequently salvaged by
overseas investment.
Fred Wolf Animation, the Los Angeles based company responsible for the
invasion of the teenage mutant Ninja turtles, has had a Dublin studio since
1989. Most recently, it did all pre- and post-production of the 11-part
television version of the Duchess of York's Budgie the Little Helicopter, to
be seen on ITV.
Mr Eamonn Lawless, Wolf's managing director in Dublin, heads a full-time
staff of 16. 'We are feeling very optimistic, but things are relatively slow
in the industry overall,' he says. 'For full-length features, Dublin would
be a good location because labour and production costs are lower than in the
US.'
But stiff competition from Asia, where labour costs are even lower, is
growing.

<HEAD>Ireland's First Woman President Takes Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's first woman president, Mary
Robinson, was inaugurated today at Dublin Castle, and she extended
a hand of friendship to both Protestants and Catholics in
strife-ridden Northern Ireland.
   ``I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and tolerance
between all the different communities sharing this island,'' Mrs.
Robinson said in her acceptance speech, delivered in English and
Gaelic.
   A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Mrs. Robinson
was sworn in by Chief Justice Thomas Finlay, following an
interdenominational service at the medieval, turreted castle.
   About 500 church and state dignitaries and Dublin-based foreign
diplomats looked on as Mrs. Robinson, wearing a purple jacket, took
the oath of office.
   Schools throughout the republic were given the day off to watch
the ceremony televised live in Britain and in the Irish Republic,
where Ireland's tricolor flags flew against cloudy skies.
   The president, a 46-year-old feminist lawyer, campaigned for the
largely ceremonial post on a liberal platform of change and a more
involved presidency. She won the Nov. 9 election with 52.8 percent
of the vote.
   She invited Irish descendants around the world to visit their
native island.
   Mrs. Robinson said she would continue Ireland's long tradition
of promoting international human rights, particularly in Latin
America and Africa, during her seven-year term in office.
   After her victory, Mrs. Robinson thanked the women of Ireland
who voted for her and ``instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the
system.''
   The president and mother of three children aged 9 to 18
addressed Irish women in her acceptance speech.
   ``As a woman I want women who have felt themselves outside
history to be written back into history ... finding a voice where
they have found a vision.''
   In 20 years in the Irish senate and as a lawyer, Mrs. Robinson
battled church and state in efforts to legalize divorce and
contraception.
   She won court cases to permit women to serve on juries, to
overturn laws criminalizing homosexuality, to restore inheritance
rights for illegitimate children and to give women legislators the
same pension rights as their male colleagues.
   Mrs. Robinson succeeds Patrick Hillery, who is stepping down
after the maximum 14 years in office.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Preaching to the converted in Ireland - Nicholas
Woodsworth samples Guinness, rain and the life of small communities on
Europe's edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS something haunting and mystical about the west of Ireland. That, at
least, is what they say, and I was willing to believe them. I had spent too
much time in the big city. My nerves were jangled. I needed tranquility. I
needed Irish whimsy and soft Celtic twilight.
Hibernian at-one-ness is not achieved just like that. It has to be worked
at, so as I drove westward from Dublin I filled my little rented car with
the music of Irish harp and pipe. Hardly had I left the Liffey than my soul
began to stir. As I whizzed past green cow pasture and midge-infested bog it
lightened and took to the air. By the time I scented the salt air of Galway
Bay I was feeling transcendent.
Fifteen minutes later, at the end of a two-mile tailback into Galway town,
it all came crashing down. There is one week in the year when tranquility
flees the west of Ireland. It is the week of the Galway races.
Half of Dublin empties and comes out for 'the crack' - that whiskey-, music-
and blarney-driven gregariousness which makes up the larger part of the
Irish genius. But it does have its drawbacks. In Galway there is not a bed
to be had, a parking space to be found, a bar stool to be sat on.
Had the crowds that filled the town been white-haired Irish biddies and
soft-spoken country gentlemen in tweeds, it might have been different. But
there were back-pack armies on the streets of Galway wearing combat boots,
Mohican haircuts and rings in their noses. And those were just the women. It
was all too much. Off I drove, in search of a gentler kind of crack.
The Aran Islands - now there was a place, I thought, where one could leave
it all behind. As I dawdled north and west along the coast of Galway Bay,
hardy little men in hand-stitched pullovers paddled doughnut-shaped fishing
boats through my imagination. But half-an-hour later I was on my way again:
the ferry landing where the Aran boats depart was a jam of tour buses,
bright nylon camping gear and gesticulating Frenchmen in new, Aran
pullovers. At peak holiday season the islands so renowned for isolation and
a quiet way of life were choking on their own reputation.
I motored northwards into the stark hills and treeless bogs of Connemara.
This, at last, seemed more like it - suddenly, I felt peacefully alone in a
great space on the farthest edge of Europe.
Mauve fuchsia blooms hung heavy on roadside hedges. Miniature haystacks sat
marooned in a jigsaw puzzle of rock-walled fields. Piles of turf lay stacked
on the bog beside deep cuts filled with tea-coloured water. Down by the
shore austere, white-washed cottages sat brooding under a fine drizzle.
The west of Ireland is the only place I know that looks good in the rain.
There is an integrity about the countryside, a harmony of gentle colours of
earth and sea - greens and greys, duns and heathers, shaley blues and peaty
browns - that is profoundly peaceful.
By Letterfrack I stopped in a thin Irish mist to watch two local teams
savage each other in the game of Gaelic football. It is such an odd, exotic
sport I found it hard to belive I was still in Europe. A few miles on I
stopped again to ask directions from a group of girls. The reply was in
Gaelic, and they had to point the way to Roundstone.
Was the lovely little coastal village of Roundstone, with its grey sea wall
and bobbing fishing boats, its single sloping street and brightly painted
houses, to be the end of my road? Alas, no. So well known as a lovely
coastal village has it become that there was not a B &amp; B room vacant. As I
arrived, a BBC film crew was preparing to video-tape an evening of quaint
Irish set-dancing in a quaint Irish pub. I fled.
The situation was grave. The west of Ireland seemed over-run by Dubliners
seeking the crack and foreigners seeking the twee. Every second town between
Kerry and Donegal had a traditional music festival, a lobster festival, a
country fair, a beauty contest, a medieval pageant, a smoked-salmon
celebration or a re-enactment of the foundering of the Armada. Such
festivals are the only things that keep the depressed towns of the west
afloat these days.
But they were not what I wanted. Where, I began asking around, feeling a
complete fool, was there absolutely nothing going on?
On Clare Island in County Mayo, I was told, nothing has happened for years.
Immediately I made tracks up the coast and abandoned my car at Roonah Quay,
the little port that sits opposite Clare Island at the mouth of Clew Bay.
The reports were right. The most exciting thing that happens around this
part of mainland Mayo is the procession of bare-footed penitents up Croagh
Patrick, Ireland's holy mountain. On Clare Island itself things are even
quieter.
Four hundred years ago Clare was the domain of Grace O'Malley, a pirate
queen who terrorised the Irish coast. These days the excitement is not quite
as great, but the income is more regular. Like most of the 150 souls on the
island, the O'Malleys - still the largest clan here - have discovered that
EC subsidy payments to sheep-farmers are a surer bet than piracy.
This does not mean that the island has lost any of its local flavour;
Brussels has a long way to go before it standardises life on Clare. When I
stepped off the ferry at Clare's tiny port (one pub, one stone castle, three
houses, one telephone box) I saw an old black London taxi ticking over at
the end of the quay.
How civilised, I thought, and prepared to climb aboard. But no, on Clare
only lobsters travel by taxi. The vehicle belongs to a local fisherman who
prizes it for its capacious interior; inside were piled half-a-dozen large
lobster traps. My own transport, a muddy great tractor driven by my charming
young B &amp; B proprietress, Maureen O'Grady, arrived a few minutes later.
What does one do on a small, isolated island that sits exposed to the full
force of the Atlantic? Often one does nothing. I spent my first day drinking
tea beside a coal fire and looking out at the gale that swept in from the
open sea.
The wind moaned, the rain surged down the window-pane. It was the kind of
weather that not even sheep enjoy. Further, along the shore-line, waves
smashed into the high rocks, sending white spume flying.
But isolation has its benefits: it makes people sociable. Later the wind
dropped, the rain let up, and I walked the half-hour back to the pub by the
port. It seemed that every villager on the island was crowded into its smoky
bar. There was the usual chit-chat and gossip of small communities. I talked
with Seamus, Maureen's burly red-haired brother, about raising salmon on the
off-shore fish farm where he works.
But sometime after 11pm, when most pubs have closed their doors, the band
struck up and everyone under the age of 80 settled down to a proper session.
Clare islanders like a bit of music, even Father Peter Gannon, whose
impromptu late-night pub appearances have resulted in local fame and a
cassette you can buy at the bar.
I did not stay hooting and dancing and emptying glasses of Guinness until
5am as Maureen and Seamus did, but I stayed long enough to talk to Michael
Moran, retired island postman. With 30 years of professional island cycling
behind him, he is sceptical of today's technology. 'I met a German on a
cycle tour the other day,' he shouted at me over the pub din. 'He told me
his bike had 21 gears. I couldn't see the need. Mine went fine, and it had
just two legs.'
I should not have been surprised at his reply when I asked how best to get
to know the island; I took his advice and the next day began walking around
on my own two legs. I walked to the beach by the port and paddled about in
glacial waters. I hiked over to the Bay View, the island's only hotel, ate
fresh salmon and gazed across the water at Croagh Patrick.
On Sunday morning, like all the islanders, I made my way past the island
abbey and a cemetery full of long-gone O'Malleys, O'Gradys and Morans, and
went to mass. Father Gannon had abandoned the accordion for the cassock, and
delivered a sermon on the need for spiritual contemplation.
As far as I was concerned he was preaching to the converted. My spirit had
never felt more contemplative. My nerves were slowly unjangling, my senses
no longer so jaded. I did not want to leave. I wondered if I could trade it
in for 100 sheep, marry Maureen O'Grady and settle down by the sea.
Perhaps there was an opening for a postman. Or a lighthouse keeper. I could,
with a bit of learning, play spoons for the musical priest. What they say is
true. There is something soul-stirring about the west of Ireland.

the multi-stained lawn-sprawlers once again were snoozing in the sun. And at

consider our weather too nice to complain about. . . . Debbie Perasso did get
a scare, though, when she turned on the kitchen faucet at her Almaden Valley
home and nothing came out. Seems her 4-year-old son, Brian, had been outside
playing with the house's main shut-off valve. "But," Perasso says, "I did
wonder for a while, 'What if we've actually run out?' " Remember the feeling,
Debbie. And see if you can share it with the water-wasters in the rest of the

<TEXT>     WIDE, WIDE WHIRL -- The San Jose/Dublin Sister City Committee thinks big.
It has scheduled activities ranging from a March 7 dinner and poetry reading
with superstar poet Seamus Heaney to the annual Hibernians' dance March 17 for
Irish Week -- a "week" that lasts 11 days. . . . That also includes the
McEnery Cup Gaelic football game March 9 pitting San Jose against San
Francisco at PAL Stadium. Last year's little-publicized inaugural match at
Bellarmine College Prep saw San Francisco win 16-12, but now that you know
about this year's they figure PAL Stadium -- where I-280, I-680 and 101
converge -- should be about right to hold the crowds. Gaelic football, in case
you're not familiar, is a cross between soccer and rugby, played without
padding or helmets. (And then they go into politics?) . . . For the more
genteel, the daily English tea service that the San Jose Fairmont planned as a
pre-Valentine's Day promotion proved so popular that the hotel is keeping it
going. Cucumber sandwiches and scones with Devonshire cream, 3 to 5 p.m. daily
in the lobby lounge, and don't forget to curl that pinkie. . . . If it's
world-beat music you're after, San Jose's Bob Culbertson, a virtuoso on the
electric guitarlike Chapman stick, and his band, African Rain, will unveil
their new album Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the Cactus Club. Emmett Chapman, who
has a certain vested interest, has said he'll be on hand. He's the Chapman
stick's inventor.;    EN-GULFED -- Distressing sight on I-880 near The Alameda
earlier this week: a large American flag blowing off the Toyota pickup to
which it had been attached, and following motorists swerving like crazy to
avoid running it over. If you're going to fly flags that way, folks, make sure
they're fastened securely so we don't start causing casualties here at home. .
. . Proprietors along Saratoga's restaurant row today are assembling goodies
to send to the Persian Gulf, a program Bill Carlson of Bella Mia calls "Taste
for the Troops." Good taste. . . . And Norma Strickland and Eva Yamamoto of In

LEST HE FORGET -- Leo Giorgetti thought he knew what all the ribbons on
automobiles were for -- red in opposition to drunk driving, white for people
against pornography, yellow for supporters of our troops in the Persian Gulf
-- but when his neighbor's car sprouted a chartreuse ribbon, the San Mateo
restaurateur had to ask. "It doesn't stand for anything," the neighbor
replied, "except I'm supposed to buy a gallon of milk on my way home from
work."  </TEXT>

   A shot fired from an army
watchtower near the Irish border killed a young civilian Sunday,
according to a military statement that expressed regret at his
death.
   Witnesses said 23-year-old Aidan McAnespie was shot in the back
while walking to a regular weekly Gaelic football game in
Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, near the border with the Irish Republic.
   The Dublin government immediately requested details of the
shooting, which comes at a time when relations between Britain and
the Irish Republic have been severely strained.
   The Royal Ulster Constablulary said a soldier at the vehicle
checkpoint was in military custody and the shooting was under
investigation.
   An army statement said it ``deeply regrets'' the death, which it
said occurred when a weapon was fired from an observation tower at
the permanent military checkpoint near the village.
   McAnespie, who lived in Aughnacloy, was said to have worked at
Monaghan in the Irish Republic, according to Press Association, the
British domestic news agency.
   Relations between Britain and Ireland have been severely
strained recently after two British decisions concerning sectarian
warfare in the predominantly Protestant British province of
Northern Ireland.
   Britain's Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of six Irishmen
sentenced to life in prison for two Irish Republican Army bombings
that killed 21 people in 1974. The court rejected arguments that
new evidence undermined the confessions and forensic findings that
sent them to prison.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly
Roman Catholic.
   Britain also decided last month not to prosecute any Northern
Ireland police officers connected with the police shootings of
unarmed Roman Catholics in an alleged ``shoot-to-kill'' policy
against Irish nationalist guerrillas.

Gaelic Resources, the Dublin-based oil group, reported a reduced net deficit
of IPounds 537,472 (Pounds 507,528) for 1992 partly reflecting its review of
exploration operations and moves into other oil activities.
The group acquired Interoil - which holds marketing rights to Vis-Breaker,
an unproven oilfield engineering process to reduce heavy crude viscosity at
the wellhead - in April. Mr Ian Forrest, chairman, said testing should be
completed by the end of next year. 'If successful . . . the Vis-Breaker will
enjoy a major international market, bringing significant benefits from
direct sales and related licence fees.'

<HEAD>Ireland's First Woman President Takes Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's first woman president, Mary
Robinson, was inaugurated Monday and extended a hand to both
Protestants and Catholics in troubled, British-ruled Northern
Ireland.
   In her acceptance speech, delivered in English and Gaelic, the
46-year-old lawyer said she would represent a ``new Ireland.''
   ``I want to do this with no hidden agenda, no strings
attached,'' said Mrs. Robinson, a Roman Catholic who married a
Protestant. ``As the person chosen by you to symbolize this
republic ... I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and
tolerance between all the different communities sharing this
island.''
   A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Mrs. Robinson
was sworn in by Chief Justice Thomas Finlay following an
interdenominational service at the medieval, turreted Dublin
Castle.
   About 500 government and church dignitaries and Dublin-based
foreign diplomats looked on as Mrs. Robinson took the oath of
office.
   The ceremony was televised live in Britain and in the Irish
Republic, where schools were closed for the day.
   Mrs. Robinson extended an invitation to Irish descendants
worldwide to visit the republic.
   ``There are over 70 million people living on this globe who
claim Irish descent and I will be proud to represent them,'' Mrs.
Robinson said. ``And I would like to see ... my official residence
to serve on something of an annual basis as a place where our
immigrant communities could send representatives for a get-together
of the extended Irish family abroad.''
   Mrs. Robinson said that in her seven-year term she would
continue Ireland's tradition of promoting international human
rights, particularly in Latin America and Africa.
   She campaigned on a platform of change and a more involved
presidency, winning the Nov. 9 election with 52.8 percent of the
vote.
   After her victory, Mrs. Robinson thanked the women of Ireland
who voted for her and ``instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the
system.''
   In her acceptance speech, the president and mother of three
addressed Irish women.
   ``As a woman I want women who have felt themselves outside
history to be written back into history ... finding a voice where
they have found a vision,'' she said.
   Britain sent troops to Northern Ireland in 1969 to end sectarian
and political violence. Nearly 2,900 people have died in bombings
and assassinations since.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland and wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic republic of Ireland under Socialist
rule.

   New York -- At the Emerald Inn or Ryan McFadden's or just
about any other Irish pub here today, the cardboard shamrocks
are up from the basement for their yearly airing. Husky "real
men" wearing "Kiss Me, I'm Irish" buttons will chug green ale
from the beer taps and croon along with Clancy Brothers
ballads pumped from the depths of the jukebox. Thus will
thousands of Irish Americans spend their St. Patrick's Day --
honoring images of an ideal land of leprechauns and
shillelaghs that their ancestors left behind.
   But downtown, in the heart of the city's East Village
area, at a cafe called Sin-E, the real Irish will celebrate
St. Paddy's Day a little differently. Young Hibernians with
long hair and pierced ears, many fresh off Aer Lingus
flights, will be listening to live acoustic music and
drinking cappuccinos or Rolling Rock beer from bottles that
are green every day. They might also skim the Irish Times or
Hot Press (Dublin's music-and-politics weekly) while tucking
into a mean Irish stew with a side of genuine imported Irish
cheese-and-onion-flavored "crisps." Rickety chairs, an
upright piano and a compact-disc player stand in for bar
stools and a jukebox. Only a soft spotlight casting the
outline of a lone cloverleaf on bare peach walls subtly
recalls the date.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The crowd at Sin-E (pronounced shinAY, which is Irish
Gaelic for "That's It") is a fairly accurate mirror of
contemporary Dublin, where the population is a little
funkier, a little more diverse and a lot younger than most of
the New Yorkers clutching their pints of stout. The cafe
itself is a magnet and a home away from home for young Irish
immigrants, many of whom have made the East Village their
social nexus, if not their nest. Sin-E is also a growing
cultural force in town. On a random night, the cafe might
play host to a poetry recital, a comedy act, a benefit for
Joe Doherty or a meeting of the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organization. Actor Gabriel Byrne and New Yorker magazine
writers read from their works-in-progress and director Lech
Kowalski ("D.O.A.," "Gringo") has been spotted there
tinkering with screenplays, ignoring the din of Van Morrison
tapes and Irish accents. Matt Dillon drops in for a smoke and
a beer. The vice consul of Ireland (who by his own admission
"spends a good bit of time there") calls it "the unofficial
Irish Arts Center."
   What's more, Sin-E is becoming known here, and in Ireland,
as one of the hottest impromptu music spots in New York.
Apart from offering free nightly performances by Irish and
American talent, Sin-E serves as a haven for the likes of U2,
the Pogues, and singer/songwriter Paul Brady, who drop by
after gigs to drink coffee, play a few tunes and unwind. Last
week, at 3:30 a.m., the Dublin band Hot House Flowers popped
in and offered a few hours of music to the heavy-lidded
crowd. (Sinead O'Connor has yet to make an appearance, but
has been seen sporting a T-shirt bearing Sin-E's Celtic
logo.)
   For Shane Doyle, Sin-E's owner and pater-familias, what
goes on at the cafe is a function of the life of the new
Irish immigrant. "The people who are coming to America now
are coming not just with economic needs, but with cultural
needs," says Mr. Doyle, who is fortyish, with long, wispy
wheat-colored hair and the intense lined face and heavy brow
of a man who has done a lot on very little sleep.
   "Until I opened this place, I had no idea of how many
Irish there were in the East Village," Mr. Doyle says, noting
that he emigrated from Dublin in 1983. In the past five
years, thousands of under-30 Hibernians, most with college
educations, have flocked to New York and eschewed the
communal safety of traditional Irish neighborhoods in the
Bronx and Queens for bohemian lives downtown. Now a dozen or
so restaurants and bars in the neighborhood fill nightly with
the voices of Irish bartenders, waitresses and patrons.
   If Sin-E is the flag bearer of the alternative Irish, Mr.
Doyle maintains that he himself is "not one to wave too many
banners. I provide the setting, but it doesn't mean I endorse
everything. I don't get instantly labeled for having a
benefit here." This St. Paddy's Day, the issue at hand is the
parade and the refusal by the Ancient Order of Hibernians to
let a contingent of Irish gays and lesbians march. Lesbians
and gays "are a part of the new Ireland, and they should be
respected," Mr. Doyle says. "The very fact that people in
Ireland are marching about abortion and the constitution and
that the parade is being contested is a sign of how much
things have changed."
   Despite its sometimes star-studded clientele, Sin-E is no
groupie-draped Hard Rock Cafe. The regulars, like most Irish,
are decidedly unstarstruck, and the atmosphere is casual and
busy in a Third World sort of way -- things get done, but in
their own time. For Mr. Doyle, the ambiance is a reflection
of himself and his key to success. He set out to create "a
place that would suit my needs. A meeting place where the
emphasis is on interaction, on people. You don't come here
for the entertainment. You are the entertainment. For me,
it's the most comfortable place to be, and a lot of other
people find it comfortable, too."
   Beer is the only alcohol served, as Mr. Doyle, vaguely
alluding to a sodden period of his life, isn't much
interested in boozing anymore. As for the music, it's what
Mr. Doyle likes: mostly Irish, but ranging from traditional
to jazz to folk to rock. "It's sort of a selfish
proposition," he says. In fact, he's loath to dislodge
himself from a perch behind a mammoth cappuccino machine
under a collection of photos of Sin-E staff with U2's Bono
and the Edge, with Ellen Barkin, with the Commitments.
   "Sin-E is a slow place in a fast city," says Grace Weir, a
29-year-old sculptor from Dublin who has clocked at least
five nights a week at the cafe since arriving in New York in
September. So slow, in fact, that it's easy to forget to pay
the bill altogether, and many patrons come straggling back
the next day to settle their balance. Mr. Doyle's accounting
system is characteristically relaxed: "I don't know what the
price of a bag of coffee is; I don't know how much sugar we
have in the bowls. Nobody does. It's not done. I just know
how much business I've got by how many tips the girls get or
how much coffee and cake goes out."
   Sin-E was born in an equally haphazard manner two years
ago, when Mr. Doyle was at a low point. The idea struck when
the somewhat eccentric, philosophical Mr. Doyle lost his
savings impetuously gambling on soybean futures, foreign
exchange and a used-tire export venture. He was charging
cigarettes and coffee at a local shop and living on a slice
of pizza a day, avoiding the telephone and its threat of
creditors' calls.
   "I don't know what possessed me, but I got this idea to
open a cafe." He found a partner willing to chip in $15,000,
and with a $100 advance to pay for the mandatory
restaurateurs' CPR training course, Mr. Doyle went out and
treated himself to a square meal. He opened Sin-E a few weeks
later with "a bag of coffee and a bag of sugar. Everything
else was given to me -- chairs, tables, cups and saucers. In
three months, we were in the black."
   Mr. Doyle believes Sin-E's success, and its social
function in the neighborhood, can grow. He wants to extend
his philosophy of socializing to a bar, which will open soon
two doors down, and eventually, to a nightclub. He's also
starting to record acoustic musicians on a "Live From Sin-E"
label. He continues to function as a subtle one-man public
relations firm for Irish bands, and his T-shirt business is
going like gangbusters. Levi's has just licensed the cafe's
Celtic logo for distribution in Ireland. At a time when all
the stores directly across East 8th Street have folded, Sin-E
is packed every night. It's enough to make you believe in the
luck of the Irish.

FT  18 APR 91 / European Diary (Ireland): Narrowing road for Ireland's
travelling people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IRELAND'S travelling people do not appear in the tourist brochures. But
their caravans are parked on the roadside approaches to most of the
country's cities and towns. Clothes are hung on hedges. Children play among
bits of scrap metal and rubbish.
The travellers - also referred to as 'itinerants' or more commonly 'tinkers'
 -are Ireland's nomads. They are on the bottom rung of Irish society.
An investigation by a government sponsored body in 1986 described their
living conditions as intolerable. Half had no access to piped water, a
toilet or electricity; 40 per cent lived by the side of the road on
unofficial sites under constant fear of eviction. 'No humane and decent
society, once made aware of such circumstances, could permit them to
persist,' it concluded.
Circumstances have changed little. The infant mortality rate of travellers
is nearly three times the national average. Life expectancy is far lower.
To most of the population, the travellers are a troublesome group who turn
garden suburbs into scrapyards, and steal milk from doorsteps and washing
off the line. They drink and fight and are not to be trusted. The
traditional view, reflected in much official policy, is that travellers
should be settled and blend in with the rest of the population.
But travellers are now pressing for better treatment. They want recognition
as a separate ethnic group, challenging the view of Ireland as a
mono-cultural country, where racism does not exist - simply because, apart
from the Irish themselves, there are no races.
There are about 21,000 travellers in Ireland - half of one per cent of the
population. While much of their history is either lost or is as yet
unresearched, there are written references to them in the 12th century. The
travellers' language, called cant or gammon, is an Irish yiddish, utilising
old Gaelic words, English and words which seem to have roots in various
other European languages.
Travellers have tended to marry other travellers. There is a deep sense of
clanship and even today marriages with 'settled people' are rare.
Until recently travellers would roam the roads of Ireland, practising
various trades along the way. They would also cross to England and Scotland.
The men would make tin pots and pans (hence 'tinker') and the women would
sell. In autumn there would be potato-picking.
Travellers were also renowned as traders, in particular of horses and
donkeys. Like nomads in many parts of the world, they have seen their old
way of life all but disappear.
Plastic and aluminium ruined the tin-making trade. Increased mechanisation
meant fewer farm jobs. Door-to-door selling has become a thing of the past.
Most of all, travellers have found it increasingly difficult to find places
to park their caravans. Often there have been clashes with local residents.
Mary and Kathleen McDonagh are travellers who run, with government and
private help, a laundry service in a traveller's settlement on the outskirts
of Dublin.
Cousins in one of the more famous traveller families, they have been living
in the same area for 17 years. 'We were here before any of the houses round
here were built,' says Mary McDonagh. 'Travellers have nowhere to go any
more.' Though both women live with their families in government-built
houses, they still regard themselves as travellers.
'In summer especially, I'd want to be on the move,' says Kathleen McDonagh.
'I'd love to take off again. My children feel the same.' She admits times
were hard. She had 12 children: only six are still living.
Travellers have begun to protest about the way they are discriminated
against. They are not allowed into most public houses and they say that
recently insurance companies have begun refusing them cover for their cars
and vans. In Dublin they have to go to a special office to collect welfare
payments, unlike others who can make such collections in their
neighbourhoods. Some schools insist that travellers attend separate classes.
Mr Niall Crowley, a social worker who has been involved with travellers for
many years, says that there must be an anti-discrimination law in Ireland,
as in other EC countries. 'Settled society is destroying the travellers way
of life and making it illegal,' says Mr Crowley. 'They were once
self-sufficient. Now they have no alternative but to exist on government
handouts.'
There is some evidence that official attitudes are changing. Mr Charles
Haughey, the Irish prime minister, recently spoke of the 'depth and value'
of the travellers culture. The government realises that the travellers won't
just go away. The birth rate in the travelling community is well above
average: 80 per cent of travellers are under 25 years of age.
The young, like the old, insist on keeping their travelling way of life,
despite all the difficulties. 'It's hard to burn the wildness out of a wild
bird's nose' is an old travellers saying.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: New look at an auld aquaintance - As Burns Night
approaches, Michael Glover considers the legacy of Scotland's greatest poet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As we raise our glasses once again on January 25 to the memory of the poet
and iconoclast Rabbie Burns, the questions arise: who was he? why do we do
it? and, perhaps most pertinent of all, is he still worth reading?
Burns the man and Burns the myth were inextricably linked from the beginning
 -largely thanks to the cunning and enterprise of Burns himself. He was born
in 1759, the son of a poor Ayrshire tenant farmer who nevertheless employed
a pedantic itinerant schoolmaster to teach young Rab the best in English
literature and grammar. From his illiterate mother, Burns imbibed an even
more precious heritage - that of Scottish songs and ballads.
He was published early, and was quickly lionised in Edinburgh as a young
prodigy - but not a learned prodigy. According to the earliest critics, he
breathed the sublime air of the 'Heavenly ploughman' and was an example of
untutored genius.
He went along with all this but was, in fact, extremely well read. He was a
great enthusiast for the empiricism of John Locke, he read fellow Scot Adam
Smith's The Wealth of Nations with approval; and he gave considerable
support to the French revolution before that great movement turned into an
unseemly parody of its own ideals.
Burns later recanted, denying that he had ever called himself a republican.
But one aspect of his view of politics remained unchanged: that it was a
game played by the rich at the expense of the poor. The belief that the
long-suffering common man remains the repository of honest values is evident
everywhere in his poetry.
Was he really the drunken fornicator that his early Calvinistically-inclined
biographers castigated him for being? As always with Burns, the answer is
both yes and no. Yes, he drank heavily. But perpetual drunkards do not
produce poetry of the quality that Burns produced. His appetite for other
women was regarded with tolerance by his wife Jean Armour, who once said
'Our Robbie should have had twa wives'.
He wrote some poetry in English, the language of his tutor, but it was
nothing beside the extraordinary vitality of his work in Scots, from the
best of the songs to the great satires on the Kirk, whose pricks he was
forever kicking against.
He lived out the identity crisis that Scotland was suffering so acutely in
the late 18th century, as the gradual process of anglicisation denied the
Scots tongue its rightful place as one of Scotland's native literary
languages, along with Gaelic. By the end of the 18th century, fashionable
literature had to be written in English and Burns's 'dialect' poems were
regarded as whimsical affairs at best.
In his heart, Burns was in fierce revolt against all this; but he knew the
power of the patron and made the necessary compromises. The worst, perhaps,
was his decision - as symbolic an act of treachery as can be imagined - to
seek office as an Exciseman, that enemy of every self-respecting Scots
drinker.
The great satires aside, are his songs - of which he thought very little and
for which he refused payment - his most enduring legacy? Anyone who listens
to Jean Redpath's definitive versions of them -all available on cassette
(Greentrax, Pounds 7), and gradually becoming available on CD (Greentrax,
Pounds 11) - might well think so.
The best and most approachable new anthology is Rhymer Rab, edited by Alan
Bold (Black Swan, Pounds 6.99), which offers a chronological survey of Burns
in poetry, letters and miscellaneous prose. A good, though academically more
severe, edition of the Selected Poems (Penguin Classics, Pounds 6.99) has
just been edited by Carol McGuirk; Catherine Carswell's excellent Life of
Robert Burns (Canongate, Pounds 5.95), first published in the 1930s to a
storm of indignation, destroyed many of the myths fondly held by misty-eyed
Burnsians. Burns Now, edited by Kenneth Simpson, (Canongate, Pounds 12.50),
is a new collection of essays that reassesses Burns as poet, thinker and
songwriter.

<AUTHOR> Richard Locke </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   Thomas Flanagan is a professor of English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, an authority on early 19th-century Irish fiction, whose first novel, "The Year of the French," appeared nine years ago to high praise. 
Its success seemed so much a function of its inimitability that one turns with both hope and trepidation to Mr. Flanagan's new book, an uncommonly long, earnest, learned historical novel bearing the somewhat windy title "The Tenants of Time" (Dutton, 824 pages, $21.95). 

   As before, rather than serving up potted index cards, bodice-ripping or psychopolitical sermonettes, Mr. Flanagan is uncompromising in his ambition to write a realistic -- and manifestly literary -- historical novel. 
He may skillfully employ the multiple narrative techniques of Conrad, but he doesn't attempt the modernistic symphonies of Faulkner or the surreal orchestral scherzos of Pynchon. 
He brings a seriousness to his work that cannot fail to elicit admiration. 

   His subject could not be grander: the tortured history of Ireland from the abortive Fenian Rising of 1867 to the fall of Parnell in 1891. 
A young Oxford graduate comes to Southwest Ireland in 1904 to examine the connections between two incidents in local history that might illuminate the inner logic of a bloody quarter century. 
He consults two complementary witnesses -- an antiquarian schoolmaster and a belle lettristic aristocrat. 
Their narratives lead him into the world of a little market town and its castle, and the narrators multiple. 

   He learns of four friends -- the schoolmaster, his cousin (a fanatic Irish nationalist), a shop clerk who becomes a lawyer and member of Parliament, and a local playboy "all froth and banter, silver flasks and flowered waistcoats, chat about women and horses." 
In their 20s they take the Fenian oath to free Ireland from British rule. 
With 60 other ragtag nationalists they attempt to seize the local police barracks on March 6, 1867, when all of Ireland is supposed to rise in the Fenians' "patchwork conspiracy." 
They fail: British troops round them up in the neighboring Clonbrony Wood and try them for treason. 
The schoolmaster and the clerk serve six months; the fanatic seven years; the playboy is let off altogether. 
But the four pass from squalid fact into legend; they become "the heroes of Clonbrony Wood," the subject of ballad, fantasy, propaganda. 

   Over the years their paths diverge: The playboy chases foxes and women, the schoolmaster collects Gaelic folklore, the clerk becomes a brilliant (and convincingly depicted) politician, and the revolutionary continues to plot murder and mayhem in the New York Irish community and then, undercover, back in Dublin and London. 
He figures in the infamous Phoenix Park murders of 1882 and in an attempt to blow up London Bridge in 1884. 

   As the clerk becomes a member of Parliament and loyal lieutenant of the most glamorous Irish patriot of the age, Charles Stewart Parnell (the "uncrowned king"), the terrorist slowly becomes drenched in blood. 
When Parnell is destroyed in 1891 -- on what seems the very eve of victory for Home Rule for Ireland -- by the revelation of his adultery with Kitty O'Shea, the clerk and the terrorist realize their own bright hopes have crashed, and they struggle to accommodate the hideous facts of the present with their fantasies of the past. 
The end of the story obliges them in the grimmest possible fashion. 
Betrayal and murder link the four again in the fields that run toward Clonbrony Wood. 

   But there's more. 
As this political tale unfolds, we also learn of life up at the castle -- of the earl who becomes an amateur impressionist painter, of his cousin who writes historical romances, and of his seductively independent wife whose love affair with the clerk-turned-politician links castle and town and -- of course -- provides an instructive parallel to the tale of adulterous Parnell. 
This novel is nothing if not intensely plotted. 

   The more than 100 characters we meet are carefully noted and their voices are in handsome supply, though they do tend toward a certain mellifluous homogeny. 
This must be an occupational hazard for a writer dealing with Ireland. 
How can one avoid such bits of local color as "the kettle above the fire was kept at the boil, and the tea itself was strong enough to trot a mouse across it, in lantern light the color of mahogany." 
At every hand lie the temptations of the set piece: "A farmhouse is best for weddings, with the barrels of stout and porter wheeled in from the barn, and a fiddler to lean against the wall, the notes moving like quicksilver, in air heavy with tobacco smoke, the smell of food, drink spilled upon rough board or close-packed earth." 

   As one breasts the current of this sometimes creamy, sometimes awkward self-regarding style (it's obviously catching), one inevitably thinks of death by drowning. 
Never fear. 
The same remarkable will that created this admirably unremitting historical narrative will carry us safely to the sounding shore. 
It's quite a remarkable performance.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Sport: Why Irish eyes must look abroad - Rugby Union / John
Hopkins analyses the sorry state of the men in green
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS

<TEXT>
THE rugby was no laughing matter at Murrayfield last Saturday, not even if
you were Scottish and celebrating a handsome 15-3 victory over the Irish in
the opening game of the international championship. What did you think of
it, Fergus Slattery was asked? 'Murrayfield is a lovely stadium,' said the
distinguished former Irish international, deliberately elliptically. 'It was
very windy.'
If Slattery was being polite, then it was in marked contrast to the
newspaper reports of Ireland's 12th successive game without victory in the
championship. 'Miserable Ireland sink to a new low at Murrayfield' ran a
headline in The Sunday Independent. The story beneath said: 'You don't often
sense misery at a major sporting occasion but it was present at Murrayfield
yesterday. You only had to be Irish to feel it. For the ailing team touched
a new low and emerged from a dull match the authors of nothing.'
Mick Doyle, who was Ireland's coach when they won the Triple Crown in 1985
(and when they were whitewashed in the championship the following season)
wrote in the same paper: 'This was the worst ever (display) by an Irish
side.' I have news for him. I have seen worse Irish teams than this but I
have never seen such a limp one. The traditional Irish fire was absent. They
seemed brow-beaten and uncertain of themselves, which are hardly Irish
characteristics.
By Tuesday, feelings had quietened and the remarks of Moss Keane were all
the more welcome for being so honest and low key. 'Our flair for rugby has
been curbed by our obsession to follow every one else,' said Keane, another
former international. 'Doing the unusual, as was our instinct, had a more
unsettling effect on the opposition. Where has the old fashioned footrush
gone? Working on fitness is fine and essential but when you have players
going out to play to a sterile, pre-ordained pattern foreign to their
traditions then you are getting nowhere.'
Rugby is of relatively little importance in the scheme of sports in Ireland,
a comfortable fourth behind Gaelic football, hurling and soccer. Only an
estimated 12,500 play rugby compared with 30 times as many in England, for
example.
'We used to close the gap that existed between us and other countries in
three ways,' said Slattery. 'First, we picked our best players. Then we were
better organised, and thirdly we gave 100 per cent for 80 minutes. We are
doing none of these now and we are showing our lack of resources.'
The Irish always seemed to be larger than life - on and off the field.
Seared into my memory and liver is the effect of a Sunday spent in the
company of Keane during the 1977 Lions' tour of New Zealand. For Keane it
was a day of rest, which meant that for everyone else it was anything but.
No wonder he was nicknamed Rentastorm. He roamed the hotel press-ganging
players and journalists to join him for a drink. He came across me just
before midday, as far as my memory goes, which is not very far, for obvious
reasons. I escaped to my bed barely vertical and far from sober after a mere
eight hours at the court of King Moss.
A few months later Keane was the host during a day in Dublin. The liver
received a second battering but what sticks more clearly in the mind is his
driving rather than his drinking. Cackling with laughter and dwarfing the
tiny gear lever in his massive left hand, the Kerryman piloted his way
around the fair city in a screech of tyres and a blur of brakes.
'Are you an ambler gambler,' he roared again and again as he diced with the
traffic lights. 'I am.'
It was around men like Keane and Willie-John McBride and Syd Millar, all of
whom had voracious appetites for life and rugby, that Ireland built their
pack in days gone by. Keane was once advised that the second row forward
playing opposite him was soft and a punch would be a good manoeuvre. 'At the
first line-out I bopped him one,' Keane recalled. 'Then bash] He hit me
straight back. I thought to myself: 'Bejabbers, I hit the wrong man'.'
Men like Keane have disappeared - at least for the time being. 'We used to
have players in key positions who always did the right thing,' said Noel
Murphy, the Ireland manager. 'We have not got men like this any more.'
I have a solution. The IRFU should look at - I am sorry for mentioning this
word, and I will wash my mouth with soap - but what they should look at is
soccer in Ireland. Some years ago it was in as much disarray as rugby is
now.
With the sort of ingenuity and disregard for convention that the Irish
professional golfers showed by staging the Irish Masters in Portugal, the
soccer authorities called in the best man to become team manager: Jack
Charlton, an Englishman who lived in Northumberland.
Charlton revitalised the national team, taking them to the late stages of
the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990. One possible candidate to revitalise
the Irish rugby team is the brilliant French coach Pierre Villepreux. He
could be found a job teaching English or French in a school in Dublin. Are
the Irish big enough to make such a break with their traditions?

<HEAD>Soldier Arrested After Civilian Shot To Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British soldier was arrested
today after he fatally shot a civilian in the back as the man
walked to a football match, the army said.
   The army said the soldier was in an observation tower Sunday at
a permanent military checkpoint a half-mile from the Irish border.
   From the tower he took a shot at the man, Aidan McAnespie, who
was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game in the village of
Aughnacloy, County Tyrone.
   The 23-year-old died on the road before medical aid or a priest
could reach him, police said.
   Police said the soldier was arrested and was being interrogated.
Villagers said McAnespie belonged to the Roman Catholic minority in
the British-ruled, Protestant-majority province.
   The army said it ``deeply regrets'' the incident. It gave no
other information and did not identify the soldier.
   ``It was cold-blooded murder _ I saw McAnespie shot in the
back,'' said Anthony McGonnell, a councilman.
   Francis Molloy, another councilman, said McAnespie was an
election worker for Sinn Fein, political arm of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army fighting British rule.
   Molloy said McAnespie claimed to have been repeatedly harassed
and threatened by the security forces.
   ``He said he was afraid the security forces would carry out
their threats,'' Molloy said.
   The shooting further strained relations between Britain and the
Irish Republic government in Dublin. Dublin called immediately for
details of the killing.
   The Irish government, which regards itself as responsible for
the Catholic minority in the north, has been angered by two recent
developments.
   The British Court of Appeal recently upheld the convictions of
six Irishmen jailed for life for two bombings that killed 21 people
on the British mainland in 1974. The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility for the blasts.
   Britain also decided not to prosecute any Northern Ireland
police officers connected with the police shootings of six unarmed
Catholics in an alleged ``shoot-to-kill'' policy against guerrilla
suspects.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly
Roman Catholic.

   Contrary to the Anglophile pipe dreams of Adrian Day
("Ireland Was United Only Under Britain," Letters to the
Editor, Dec. 12), Ireland has been one single sovereign
country occupying the entire island of Eire for thousands of
years -- long before the petty warring principalities of the
Angle and Saxon barbarians were formed into one nation by the
Vikings in 1016 A.D.
   The Irish system consisted of one High King ruling over
four major subordinate kingdoms, each consisting of a dozen
or so minor kingdoms. These kings did not inherit their
positions but were elected to them. Brian Boru, one of the
more recent High Kings, decisively defeated the Vikings at
Clontarf, Ireland, in 1014 A.D.

<TEXT>
   Since the invasion of Ireland by a Norman army
representing the English throne in 1169 A.D., tiny Ireland
has faced constant invasions by England -- a country 20 times
more populous. Ireland has suffered every imaginable
atrocity, including multiple genocides and the deliberate
total destruction of its vast forests.
   Ireland never surrendered -- not even during the brutal
military occupation of the entire country, which lasted from
1692 to 1922, when the minuscule Irish army drove the English
army out of 80% of the country; the retreating English
managed to cling to a beachhead that was presented to the
world as a legitimate statelet dubbed "Northern Ireland."
   It is hoped that with the liberation of the rest of
occupied Ireland, the English propaganda machine will stop
pumping its fictions about Ireland into gullible minds in
this country.

   Mr. Day stated that the pope in 1155 "gave the island to
the English." Left out was one ironic fact: The pope in
question (who had taken the title Adrian IV) was himself an
Englishman.
   His true name was Nicholas Breakspear, the only English
pope, who apparently remained loyal to his native land.
   John F. Drum

   ---
   One would be hard pressed to concur with Mr. Day's
assertion of a united Ireland under the British in light of
the discriminatory practices, most notably the Penal Laws.
Under these laws, Irish Catholics could not sit in or vote
for the "national Parliament {that} evolved." They were not
allowed to practice law or to serve in the navy, and were not
permitted to possess arms or own a horse. No Catholic could
run a school or send his children abroad to be educated. The
complex landownership regulations virtually removed land from
Catholic hands.
   If this is Mr. Day's idea of unification, I'd say it is he
who is suffering from illusions.
   Thomas P. Kelly
   Jersey City, N.J.
   ---
   I was outraged when I read Mr. Day's denial that Ireland
was not a nation before the British conquered it, as if that
makes the military occupation reasonable or justified. For
centuries before 1002 A.D., when Ireland was first united
under King Brian Boru, the island had been divided into four
rival kingdoms: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. In
general, a single, powerful family or clan dominated each
kingdom. With Ireland's unification under King Brian, the
four kingdoms eventually disappeared.
   The British have committed, and are committing, genocide
of Irish people and Irish culture. It was once a crime to be
a Catholic or speak Gaelic.
   The world today cannot tolerate European colonization of
Africans or Asians, but continues to allow Britain to use its
army to kill Irishmen in Ireland for exercising their desire
to live free from foreign domination. Poland is free, Latvia
is free; isn't it a stain on the cloak of freedom that in the
last decade of the 20th century, the Irish are still not free
of the English master?

<HEAD>Dublin Government To Launch Own Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former parish priest of an
Irish nationalist who was shot dead from an army observation tower
said Monday that police and soldiers harrassed the victim for
several years.
   British officials said they have launched an investigation into
the incident Sunday in Northern Ireland near the Irish border. But
in Dublin, the Irish government announced it will hold its own
probe headed by the deputy Irish police chief.
   McAnespie's death came at a time of severe strain in Anglo-Irish
relations over other incidents involving the police and the
province's Catholic minority.
   The Rev. Brendan McHugh said Aidan McAnespie had to cross the
Irish border daily to go to work and was constantly harassed at the
army checkpoint.
   ``We complained time out of number to the police and military,
but no action was ever taken. Life for the poor man had just become
unbearable,'' he told reporters.
   The army said it ``deeply regrets'' the shooting. It said
23-year-old McAnespie was hit by a bullet fired from an army
observation post about half a mile from the Irish border in County
Tyrone.
   Police said the soldier involved was in military custody while
an investigation was launched. No details about the soldier were
given. Police declined to comment on the priest's allegations of
harassment.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said
security sources reported that the soldier involved told detectives
a machine gun was accidentally discharged as he handed it to
another soldier.
   The agency also quoted unidentified sources as saying three
strike marks were found on the roadway near the victim, indicating
three shots might have been fired.
   McAnespie's brother-in-law, Paul McCabe, said of the
investigation announced by the Dublin government: ``We welcome any
attempt to bring the murderer of Aidan to real justice and ensure
that there is not yet another cover-up.
   ``Maybe at this late stage the Irish government will finally
recognize the reality of families like ourselves having to put up
with constant harassment. ... In the light of recent developments
of incidents here (in Northern Ireland) I do not think anyone would
be prepared to give evidence to the RUC.''
   The RUC _ Royal Ulster Constabulary _ is Northern Ireland's
police force. Its policemen are frequent targets of Irish
Republican Army gunmen and bombers. Allegations that the RUC tried
to thwart an investigation into the slaying of six unarmed
Catholics by an RUC unit in 1982 has intensified the deep hostility
among many Catholics toward the force.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.
   Relatives said McAnespie was walking to a regular weekly Gaelic
football game in the Northern Ireland village of Aughnacloy, County
Tyrone, when he was shot. He had passed through the checkpoint,
which lies on the route to the football ground.
   Francis Molloy, a local councilman, said McAnespie was an
election worker for Sinn Fein, political arm of the IRA. The IRA
denied McAnespie was among their members.
   McHugh said McAnespie was never involved in paramilitary
activity but was harassed nevertheless.
   ``He was never abused physically, just verbally, and his car was
often taken apart,'' McHugh said, referring to vehicle searches.
``I don't know why he was singled out for such treatment.''
   ``The campaign against him must have been going on for at least
five years. Other young lads were also stopped, but Aidan appeared
to be getting special treatment,'' he said.
   Last month Britain provoked Irish outrage by saying it will not
prosecute policemen accused of perverting the course of justice in
the aftermath of the killing of six unarmed Catholics in three
incidents in late 1982.
   The strain was compounded by a British appeals court's refusal
to overturn the conviction of six Irishmen accused of perpetrating
twin bombings that killed 21 people in 1974. Many Irish officials
and civilians believe the six are victims of a miscarriage of
justice.

<HEAD>Ireland Probes Ulster Shooting; Soldier in 1983 Shooting Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British soldier ordered
jailed for life for killing a Belfast Roman Catholic has been freed
and returned to his regiment after serving only three years in
prison, the army said today.
   The disclosure came amid Anglo-Irish tensions following the
killing of a Catholic man on Sunday by a British soldier and the
Irish government's decision to conduct its own investigation of the
slaying, which occurred in Northern Ireland.
   The announcement that the convicted killer, Pvt. Ian Richard
Thain, was back in uniform, although not in Northern Ireland,
provoked sharp reactions from leaders of the province's Catholic
minority. At the same time, leaders of Northern Ireland's
Protestant majority were angered by Dublin's announcement that it
will probe Sunday's killing.
   Thain was jailed for the fatal shooting of Thomas Reilly, road
manager of the pop group Bananarama, on Aug. 9, 1983. Thain claimed
in court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed
Reilly was about to pull a gun on him.
   But the judge found him ``deliberately untruthful'' and said he
did not believe Thain truly feared Reilly was about to shoot at
him. Thain was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for
actions in Northern Ireland.
   An army statement said Thain was then 18 and ``while the army in
no way condones his action, we consider the incident to have been a
tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very difficult
circumstances.''
   The Home Office said Thain was released on a life license, a
form of parole whereby he can be reimprisoned ``should his behavior
give rise to concern.'' It said he was freed after a review by the
state parole board.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, said Thain's release showed there was no justice
in Northern Ireland. The victim's father, Jim Reilly, said: ``I'm
very, very shocked and distressed. I can't believe this has
happened.''
   Meanwhile, the Irish government sent Deputy Police Commissioner
Eugene Crowley to Monaghan, on the border with Northern Ireland, to
launch an investigation into Sunday's shooting of 23-year-old Aidan
McAnespie.
   McAnespie was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower
at a checkpoint near Aughnacloy, half a mile from the frontier in
County Tyrone.
   Relatives said he was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game
and had passed through the checkpoint when he was shot.
   McAnespie was a Sinn Fein supporter, and his former parish
priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the
checkpoint. Press Association, the British news agency, said the
soldier who fired at McAnespie told his interrogators it was an
accident. The soldier is in military custody.
   The Irish move was seen as a calculated slight to Britain, since
its police force in the province was conducting an inquiry. British
authorities stressed that the Irish investigation would be confined
to Ireland's side of the border.

At an Irish pub in Seal Beach, they celebrated St. Patrick's Day with an 
old-fashioned wake of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
An open casket was laid out across the bar's pool table, and dozens of people 
stopped in to sneak a peek at the coffin. Inside was a stuffed doll wearing a 
bumper sticker that said, "Kiss me, I'm Irish." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a comic thing. It's not meant to be morbid," Irisher Pub owner Robert 
Campregher said of the ghoulish St. Patrick's Day tradition. "I had to stick a 
bolt through his neck, though, because last year some people stole the head and 
wouldn't give it back." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Orange County, thousands of Irish and non-Irish alike donned 
bright green and pinned shamrocks to their lapels Saturday to celebrate St. 
Patrick's Day with step dancers, bagpipers, a parade and plenty of Irish beer. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most popular day of the year to be Irish. If you weren't, it was 
good day to fake it. 
</P>
<P>
Several leprechauns -- or at least small children dressed up as Irish imps -- 
were spotted on floats inching along Olympiad Road in Mission Viejo. There, 
high school bands and homecoming queens, clowns, equestrians, baton twirlers, 
politicians, youth groups, floats and motorcades of classic cars -- even 
Irish-made Deloreans -- paraded for two hours before enthusiastic green-clad 
onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, revelers flocked to area pubs to party. The Guinness and Budweiser 
were flowing, sometimes dyed green just for the occasion. After a few beers, 
jolly strangers became instant buddies, old-timers reminisced about the old 
days back in Ireland and dancers clicked their heels and twirled each other 
about in reels. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, Kay Grimm, 58, was not answering to anything but Kay 
Fitzgerald McMillen, a combination of both her Irish parents' surnames. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one time of the year when I can go out and find my roots," said 
Grimm, a real estate appraiser, flashing a sticker that read, "Whiskey makes me 
frisky." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I like to come out and appreciate being Irish." 
</P>
<P>
Grimm was among hundreds of celebrators who poured into the Harp Inn, a popular 
Irish pub in Costa Mesa. There, regulars swapped tall tales, delighting 
first-timers and those who simply came out to rub elbows with the Irish. Irish 
patrons basked in their glory, thickening their brogues to spin yarns between 
mouthfuls of corned beef hash and cabbage. A few Irish immigrants huddled 
together at the bar and tried to persuade one of their buddies to say a few 
words in Gaelic. 
</P>
<P>
A few snickered when they caught wind of the words of a song that Annie Murphy, 
an Irish-American, was belting above the roar of the crowd: It was a woman's 
lament that her husband had changed for the worse after their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Niland, 44, had apparently done his share of kissing the Blarney stone. 
Niland, a cabinetmaker from western Ireland, was full of the gift of gab, 
entertaining a small crowd with a steady stream of ghoulish jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"In Ireland, whenever someone dies we get together to celebrate the poor 
devil's death," said Niland of Huntington Beach. "We always say, a good wake is 
better than a bad wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Others raised their glasses to an old Irish toast: "May you be in heaven an 
hour before the devil knows you are dead." 
</P>
<P>
The revelers came from Oregon, New York and as far away as London to celebrate 
St. Patrick's Day with friends in Orange County. Many weren't even Irish. "I 
come here every St. Patrick's Day because they just don't celebrate it in 
England and Ireland like they do here," said Clive Collins, 29, of London. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Ireland, they'll have a couple of drinks, but it's not as 
commercialized as it is here."

FT  19 DEC 92 / Food &amp; Drink: The essence of Islay malt whiskies - It takes
more than new technology to distil good Scotch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IAN HENDERSON, who manages both the Laphroaig and Ardbeg distilleries on the
whisky island of Islay, off the Scottish coast, tells a charming story about
a group of Japanese technicians who visited there.
'They were very bright lads,' says Henderson. 'They had put their doctorates
well behind them and had come to learn about whisky distilling first-hand.'
Every day for two weeks, they tailed Henderson, his stillmen and
warehousemen, observing the process from start to finish.
First, they saw the steeping of the barley to transform it into malt. They
watched the malt drying in the peat kilns and the preparation of the
porridge-like 'mash'; the sweet 'wort' being turned into a strong beer
called 'wash'; the wash distilled once to make the 'low wines' and then a
second time to make the clear spirit that was young whisky. Finally, they
went out into the warehouses where the spirit was run off into old bourbon
hogsheads or the occasional sherry butt.
The Japanese fed everything into their computers. After two weeks, a worried
member of the party requested a meeting with Henderson. They were sorry to
have to say this, they told him, but they were now absolutely certain that
something was being hidden from them: 'Please, when is it that you add 'the
essence'?'
I sympathise. The basic process of making whisky is not hard to understand.
For centuries, the roughest Irish peasant has known how to do it on an
exposed outcrop with a few potatoes and a kettle.
Great whisky, however, is a little more complicated. Much depends on the
shape of the stills, and few distillers can offer an adequate explanation of
why the distillery decided on a squat, onion-shaped still, or some more
elegant form with a thin, tapering stem. The one, they tell us, will make a
heavy, even coarse, whisky; the other a light, refined spirit.
Until comparatively recently, Islay was a remote place with a wild,
Gaelic-speaking population who responded only (and even then only
occasionally) to the authority of the exciseman.
Jim McEwen, who manages the Bowmore distillery in Islay's 'capital,'
remembers the days when the distillery played host to all sorts of strays
from the hills.
'They would take their cups and drop them into the 'deoch' (the strong beer
or wash which is called 'Jo' in Speyside), then settle down by one of the
many coal or peat fires which burned in the distillery and sing Gaelic
songs. When the exciseman returned from his tea, he would chase them away,'
McEwen said.
As a child, he and his classmates would steal lumps of coal from the
distillery and carry them back to his parents' house. At 15, he started work
in the cooperage. One of his jobs was to prepare the 'drams' for the thirsty
workers. Thinking they would appreciate something special, he dipped into a
sherry butt to find a particularly sweet, old whisky. But the workers turned
up their noses at the stuff. For them, the only drink was 'white' whisky,
straight from the still at a fiendish 65`.
With eight surviving large distillery buildings dating from the 19th century
(a ninth, Port Charlotte, was closed in the 1930s and the buildings
subsequently demolished or turned over to other uses), Islay whiskies
clearly were valued in the last century.
Until fairly late in the 19th century, Islay was something of a tax haven
for distillers by virtue of its remoteness. Another possible factor in its
rise was its proximity to Ireland (it is just 18 miles to Antrim).
Irish whiskey was rather more famous than Scotch a century ago and it is
feasible that Islay malts were passed off as Irish ones. Islay must have
come into its own, however, with the beginning of whisky blends at the end
of the last century.
Blenders appreciated Islay spirits for their 'peat reek.' The peat bogs of
the island always have been a cheap source of fuel, and malt kilned over
peat will develop a heavy, smoky character which will contribute a distinct
taste to the whisky. Both Bowmore and Laphroaig kiln about 20 per cent of
their malt. The rest, along with all the peated malt for the other
distilleries, comes from the maltings at Port Ellen at the south end of the
Island.
A little peat goes a long way when it is expressed in parts per million: a
great bruiser of an Islay malt such as Ardbeg will specify 50 parts per
million. Its stablemate, Laphroaig, requires 35, at which level the
peatiness will still be there but some of the delicacy of the spirit will
come through. Bowmore treads the middle way with 25-30 in the pursuit of
elegance. As for Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich, their specifications are
1-2 parts per million for the former and none for the latter.
At the maltings, they assured me that Bruichladdich would still have some
peat character, just from the peat smoke travelling round the maltings. That
not withstanding, at these levels both Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich could
be described as Speyside in style.
That leaves three. Port Ellen closed its doors in 1983 - although bottles of
its exceptionally fine malt are still available from specialists. Both the
remaining United Distillers' plants, Lagavulin and Caol Ila, used to ask for
45 parts per million. Three months ago, however, the instruction reached
Port Ellen to reduce the peating of the malt to 35, the same level as Allied
Distillers' Laphroaig. I was told this at the maltings.
Elsewhere on the island, I found few people were aware of United's decision
to alter radically the style of its whiskies. Many thought I had been given
privileged information. At Laphroaig, Ian Henderson had been told of the
move but was reluctant to offer an explanation.
Whereas Caol Ila is used chiefly for blending - a good deal goes into
Johnnie Walker - Lagavulin is marketed widely as an exquisite 16-year-old.
For the next 16 years, nothing will affect the taste, but what then?
Lagavulin is also the mainstay of the White Horse blend. Was the decision to
tone down Lagavulin taken with White Horse in mind?
In terms of value for money, the Lagavulin 16-year-old is one of the best
old malts on the market, with Threshers selling it at Pounds 22.99 a bottle.
Laphroaig's delicately fruity 15-year-old is more than Pounds 10 more.
Neither the rather angular Caol Ila nor the massive, robust Ardbeg is
distributed widely, which - in the case of the latter, at least - is a pity.
Now that United has begun to change the peat levels on its whisky, Ardbeg
assumes an even greater importance as the most uncompromising of the Islay
malts.
It should never be forgotten, however, that peat is just half the story when
it comes to present-day Islay malts. Like Bunnahabhain, Bowmore uses an
appreciable amount of sherry wood on its old whiskies, imbuing them with
sweet fruitiness which covers the peatiness of the raw spirit.
The 17-year-old is balanced superbly but the 12-year-old (Pounds 21.29 from
Peatlings, tel: 0284-755-948), with its notes of candied peel, is not to be
sneezed at, either. Bunnahabhain's warhorse is the 12-year-old (Oddbins
Pounds 19.99).
The big stills here run off a spirit at a higher strength, making the whisky
more delicate with a sweet honey and heather character.
Tasted 'blind,' few would recognise Bruichladdich as an Islay malt. The
15-year-old (Pounds 26.50 from Lea &amp; Sandeman, tel: 071-376-4767) is the
favourite of the distillery manager, Ian Allen. I agree with him. The sea
there is everywhere, rusting the hoops of the casks before they are two
years old. The sea is yet another inscrutable part of Islay's essence.

   An Associated Press correspondent based in
London gathered material for this story on a bicycle, getting about
the way many people do on the Aran Islands in Ireland's Galway Bay.
It is one of a series of periodic dispatches by Associated Press
correspondents on life and customs in the byways of the world.

<DATELINE>KILRONAN, Aran Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people out here in Galway Bay
are often thought of as the most Irish of the Irish. That's because
they haven't changed much from the past even though telephones,
television, tourists and airplanes leave them less isolated.
   An outsider, touring on a bicycle, soon finds that out.
   The ride across Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands,
began brightly at noon but, fittingly Irish, the lowering mist
brought a soft rain that fell ceaselessly until nightfall.
   The sprightly pony traps, two-wheeled carriages, lined up near
the harbor at Kilronan, Inishmore's main village, would have been
more comfortable; so would one of the tour buses that hurtle along
the narrow roads.
   But to get the real flavor of life in the gray labyrinth of
centuries-old limestone walls, the bicycle works best for a
close-up view of the remnants of an ancient Gaelic culture that has
largely vanished on the Irish mainland.
   The incursion of modern appliances has left the 1,300 islanders
largely unchanged and the government keeps the Irish language alive
here by paying families to speak it.
   The playwright J.M. Synge, who made his reputation with his rich
dialogue sketches of Aran peasant life, wrote in 1907 that here
``one is forced to believe in a sympathy between man and nature.''
   The Aran archipelago _ Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer _
stretches across the mouth of Galway Bay in western Ireland. It
attracts a steady flow of visitors _ ``strainseiri'' (strangers) to
the islanders.
   When Christianity was dawning in Ireland, the islands were a
retreat for ascetics and scholars, and even today, schoolchildren,
academics and civil servants arrive every summer to immerse
themselves among the islanders.
   The treeless landscape of rain-polished limestone is strewn with
granite boulders, scored with deep fissures, adorned with 437 known
species of wild flowers. The walls separating patches of green
pasture are stippled with orange lichen.
   The land, bounded by wave-pounded craggy cliffs, is littered
with prehistoric forts, crosses, stone huts and ecclesiastical
ruins. Inishmore has one main road.
   ``There's nothing on Inishmore but scenery and people,'' said
Doreen Meagher, a Dublin drama teacher who has owned a house here
since 1967. ``There's nothing laid on for you, no hurdy-gurdy, no
concerts or theater _ just fresh air, unpolluted water, lovely
scenery.
   ``They're a race apart and will never integrate,'' she said of
the islanders. ``They're frightfully clannish. They must have got a
talking-to by the tourist board _ they're more friendly this year
than they have been.''
   Indeed, the islanders seem to have plenty to say, often
switching from Irish to English in mid-sentence. The government
pays child and housing allowances to families whose children are
fluent in Irish.
   While Aran traditions might be under assault, the strong
community spirit remains intact. Fishermen still use currachs,
canvas-covered boats, or fish from the high cliffs with twine on a
stick.
   But no longer do they clamber down cliffs at night to snatch
sleeping puffins for their feathers. Aran sweaters are still
handknitted, and snapped up by tourists. But the brown-sailed
``hookers'' that carried turf from Connemara are gone, as are the
rope makers, basket weavers and coopers.
   Most people still live off fishing and farming, but tourism is
slowly filling Kilronan with bed-and-breakfast guesthouses,
restaurants, gift shops and pubs named Lucky Star or American Bar,
where Budweiser beer is available alongside Irish stout.
   A civic hall offers the tourists daily screenings of ``Man of
Aran,'' the vivid 1934 portrait of Inishmore by Robert Flaherty, an
American pioneer of film documentary.
   On the smaller island of Inishmaan stands ``Synge's Chair,''
slabs of rock arranged on the cliffside spot where the playwright
had written of ``perpendicular cliffs under my ankles and over me
innumerable gulls that chase each other in a white cirrus of
wings.''
   Once on the eight-mile uphill road out of Kilronan, the
windswept barrenness becomes complete. Visitors walk the last mile
of rocky land to Dun Aenghus, a prehistoric fort with three
concentric enclosures on the edge of a 300-foot cliff, where the
relentless rain seeps through every layer of clothing.
   The fort's keeper had retreated to Diriane's pub where, between
sips of Guinness stout, he taught two soaked German tourists to say
``It's a wet day'' in Irish: ``Is la fliuch e'' (pronounced iss law
floo-uck ay).
   In the American Bar, 85-year-old Antoine O'Briain welcomed a
newcomer with a knuckle-bumpy handshake.
   ``In my youth, we always used to be out on the ocean,'' he said.
Speaking Irish through an interpreter, he recalled how in World War
II German U-boats would surface inside rings of currachs to evade
radar detection by British warships, and U-boat crews would be fed
tea and sandwiches.
   ``There isn't anybody here who hasn't had someone who drowned,''
said lobsterman Michael Joyce, 35.
   Four of his 13 classmates have died at sea, but Joyce said he
would live nowhere else, because only here can he raise his four
children his own way.
   ``Here, it's a whole village,'' he said. ``If you have a
problem, you tell it to the first person you meet in the morning.''
   Breandan O hEithir, 58, welcomes the modern conveniences:
electricity, TV, telephones, motorcycles in place of donkeys.
   ``What I see vanishing is picturesque stuff that appeals to
tourists, but really the people are surprisingly unchanged in their
attitudes,'' said O hEithir, an Inishmore native and columnist for
the Irish Times, a Dublin-based national newspaper.
   In his youth, the highlight was the arrival of the Galway ferry
on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Now, ferryboats make the 10-mile
crossing from Connemara every hour or two, and Aer Arann flies
daily to all the islands.
   ``It can be black enough, the whole business of isolation,'' O
hEithir said. ``But the isolation is gone now and that's a good
thing.''

<HEAD>Two Given Long Sentences For Plotting IRA Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Northern Ireland men were sentenced today to
17 and 20 years in prison for plotting an Irish Republican Army
terror campaign in Britain. The prisoners raised their fists to
supporters as they were led away.
   Patrick McLaughlin, 40, received a 20-year sentence for
conspiring to cause explosions in England. Liam McCotter, 25, was
sentenced to 17 years on the same charge. Both are from Belfast.
   ``You contemplated explosions which were likely to endanger
human life,'' High Court Justice John Owen. ``I bear in mind there
was sufficient explosive material to cause 25 such explosions.''
   He gave the longer sentence to McLaughlin because of
McLaughlin's two previous convictions, for riotous behavior in 1971
and for possession of a gun and ammunition in 1974.
   After the sentences were read, a man in the public gallery
shouted in Gaelic, ``Our day will come!''
   McLaughlin and McCotter raised their fists, and McCotter chanted
IRA slogans as the men were taken away. They were driven from the
courthouse in an armed convoy with a helicopter hovering above.
   Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad arrested the pair Feb. 19,
1987 after following them to two weapons caches containing almost
200 pounds of high explosives, detonators, timing devices, three
automatic rifles, two handguns, and ammunition.
   The weapons were hidden in plastic garbage cans buried in
Macclesfield and Delamere forests south of Manchester, in northern
England.
   Court testimony did not reveal what the targets may have been,
but anti-terrorist sources mentioned as a possibility last June's
general election campaign. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher won a
third term in the election.
   Police said the weapons were smuggled into England through
northern Wales.
   McLaughlin and McCotter were kept under surveillance for four
days as they brought the materials into the forests and hid them.
They made cuts in tree bark to mark the hiding places.
   Police also followed the pair to a nighttime rendezvous with a
trawler at Camaes Bay in north Wales, where arms reportedly changed
hands. Police feared exposing their operation and allowed the
vessel to leave.
   Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad is still searching for two
people in the case. One is a man known only as Alan Robinson, who
rented the apartment used by McLaughlin and McCotter. Maps of
London and Manchester were found in the apartment. The other
suspect has not been identified.
   The IRA is outlawed in Britain. It is fighting to drive the
British from Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish
Republic.

The nation's first female president, Mary Robinson, was inaugurated today at 
Dublin Castle, and she extended a hand of friendship to both Protestants and 
Catholics in strife-ridden Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and tolerance between all the 
different communities sharing this island," Robinson said in her acceptance 
speech, delivered in English and Gaelic. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Robinson was sworn in by 
Chief Justice Thomas Finlay at the medieval, turreted castle after an 
interdenominational service. About 500 church and state dignitaries and 
Dublin-based foreign diplomats attended. 
</P>
<P>
The president, a 46-year-old feminist lawyer, campaigned for the largely 
ceremonial post on a liberal platform of change and a more involved presidency. 
She won the Nov. 9 election with 52.8% of the vote.

   Young Willie spent many summers with Uncle Henry Middleton at
Elsinore House, which had a secret tunnel for the delivery of
contraband from the beach and the ghost of that smuggling ancestor
strolling the veranda or tapping at the window pane.
   Nearby lived bachelor uncle George Pollexfen, a spirit-raising
medium who imbued Yeats with a lifelong infatuation with horoscopes,
seances, crystal balls, tarot cards, telepathy and remembering
bizarre dreams like the apparition of ``Bernard Shaw as a smiling
sewing machine.''
   Young Yeats sat with old people by their turf fires to hear myths
and legends he later retold in ``The Celtic Twilight'': tales about
Queen Maeve buried in the massive cairn near the top of Knocknarea,
the warrior Cuchulain who fought the horses of the sea in Sligo Bay,
and the O'Cuirnin family of Gaelic bards with whom he felt a mythic
kinship when rowing out to their island in Lough Gill.
   Yeats set for himself the poetic goal of bringing together
Ireland's heroic legends and rural folklore after listening to tales
told by the likes of ``one Paddy Flynn, a little bright-eyed old man
who lived in a leaky one-room cabin'' on the Sligo road and often
was found ``under a hedge smiling in his sleep'' after dancing the
night away with troops of leprechauns.
   The ghost-mad lad known hereabouts as ``old parson Yeats
great-grandson'' went off to Stockholm in 1923 to receive the Nobel
Prize for literature from the King of Sweden.
   Going down the eight fairway at Rosses Point, the cultured golfer
can see the gray stone walls of Lissadell, the Georgian country
house of Sir Henry Gore-ooth, also haunted and now open to tourists.
Here Yeats wrote a tragic poem to the two daughters that begins:
   ``The lights of evening, Lissadell,
   ``Great windows open to the south,
   ``Two girls in silk kimonos, both
   ``Beautiful, one a gazelle.''
   Constance, the older of two, not the gazelle, whose name was Eve,
was an impassioned Irish revolutionary who was sentenced to a firing
squad for commanding the forces that held St. Stephen's Green during
the Easter Rising of 1916. Her sentence was commuted to life in
prison, and Yeats wrote several poems to her before her eventual
release.
   Britain hurriedly executed 16 leaders of the rising, including
the severly wounded James Connolly, who was carried in a wheel chair
out to the firing squad, and Yeats helped canonize them as martyrs
in a magnificent canto.
   Farther south along the coast in neighboring County Galway is
Coole Park, where for two decades Yeats was the frequent house guest
of the playwright Lady Augusta Gregory.
   The great house in Dublin where they launched the Irish National
Theater, which soon became the Abbey Theater, has been torn down,
but in the walled garden amid the ruins is a huge copper bench
carved with the initials of Yeats, Shaw, Sean O'Casey, John
Masefield, the painter Augustus John and the abbey's resident
genius, John Millington Synge.
   A few miles away is Thoor Ballylee, the 14th century Norman tower
that Yeats renovated as a summer cottage for Georgie Hyde-Lees, the
22-year-old bride he took after years of pining away in impassioned
poetry for actress Maud Gonne.
   George, as she was called in life as well as on her tiny
tombstone, was also a psychic medium who introduced Yeats to
``automatic writing.''
   The tower, which figured in the title of two collections of
Yeats' verse, is now a Yeats museum. Tourists can climb the winding
stairs to the secret room on the top floor where the couple sought
contact with the beyond.
   George continues to intrigue the pilgrims who ignore Yeats'
injunction to pass by the grave.
   ``It's the name of his dog,'' pastor Hayman has heard many a
visitor comment.
   ``Actually,'' said Cantwell, ``Yeats had a dog named Daniel
O'Connell.''
   The poet was never comfortable with the laboring class that
worshiped The Liberator but a generation later deserted Charles
Parnell. Although a shrewd businessman himself, who cast a warm eye
on the abbey's box office, Yeats also professed haughty disdain for
the merchants who ``fumble in a greasy till.''
   The poet, said Cantwell, ``regarded the peasants as the font of
Irish poetic lore and greatly admired the occupants of the stately
houses, but he didn't care much for those in between.''
   A sense of ``romance and adventure'' propelled the Rev. Hayman
from St. Luke's in downtown San Francisco to St. Columba's in rural
Sligo. Several summers before, while based in Seattle, he had
swapped pulpits with a Limerick clergyman and ``fell in love with
Ireland. When Drumcliff became available last March, my wife Sally
and I were ready.''
   Going though the parish archives he discovered that the Rev. John
Yeats, the poet's ancestor, ``had run up a bill of some 400 pounds
with the wine merchant in Sligo, which was a goodly amount in 1846.''
   So far pastor Hayman has had neither the occasion nor the
collection receipts to match that standard of hospitality. His noon
service on Sunday draws a congregation of 55, ``mostly farming
people.''
   But with the advent of summer and the return of the chartered
buses, the parish operates a little tea shop in a shed near the
rectory and provides toilet facilities.
   ``It's really amazing,'' Hayman says. They come from all over.
France. Holland. Germany. Many from Japan and Korea. If you noticed,
we just had new doors put on the church. Those lovely brass handles
were the gift of the Yeats Society of Western Australia.''
   The pilgrims arrive full of awe and sometimes wonder. ``This past
summer,'' Hayman recalls, ``a busload arrived led by a Roman
Catholic priest who was totally dumbfounded to find that Yeats was
buried in a Protestant churchyard.''
   The American pastor at Drumcliff is called upon time and again to
explain that enigmatic epitaph. ``I always have to admit I don't
know what it means. Some scholars say the poet may be addressing his
own ghost. All I know is you could write a Ph.D. thesis on those few
words.''

PUB, NETWORK OF COUNTRYMEN MAKE U.S. LIFE A WEE BIT BETTER

Gerry Mackey is sitting at the door of his Costa Mesa pub, the Harp Inn, where 
he greets -- by name -- each person who enters. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the pub is noisy, but not from loud music or even the wide-screen TV in 
the corner, where a Boston Celtics basketball game plays silently. The lively 
din comes from the customers -- laughing, telling stories, trading jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"The art of conversation is one of the greatest things we have to offer," says 
Mackey, stroking his graying beard. "Everybody knows everybody, which is rare 
for bars in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of bars put a shamrock or a leprechaun on the sign and call themselves 
Irish, but only a handful actually resemble a real Irish pub. Back home, the 
pub is a social center, not just a place to drink. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pub could, to a certain extent, be any little village pub in Ireland," 
says Mackey, and the clientele seems to bear out his boast. Irish brogues are 
everywhere, and the regulars include everyone from Irish-Americans several 
generations removed from their roots to new immigrants right off the plane. 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County's Irish, scattered over the suburban landscape, such spots as 
the Harp and the newer International Pub and Platter in Newport Beach provide a 
cultural touchstone, a place to share a common heritage for a people who 
cherish community values. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of Irish in Southern California," says Mackey, "but it's so 
spread out, it's difficult to get together in any sort of numbers." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980 census, the most recent local statistics available, 67,802 people 
in Orange County listed Irish as their single ancestry, while almost 300,000 
more said they were at least partly Irish. With no cohesive communities like 
those in such cities as Boston, New York and Chicago, Orange County's Irish 
community has been, until recent years, sprawling and largely assimilated. 
</P>
<P>
But since the early '80s, the local Irish community has been infused with a 
shot of new blood, as many young Irish have fled a stagnant economy that offers 
few job opportunities. The official unemployment rate in the Republic of 
Ireland has topped 20%, with the jobless rate for workers under 25 roughly 
twice that. 
</P>
<P>
So Ireland has lost a young, highly educated generation that has left the 
island nation's fabled green for the green of better job prospects abroad. Many 
have come to the United States, and while a good percentage settled in Irish 
communities in the East and Midwest, others have been enticed West by sunshine 
and a healthy economy. Some of them arrived legally, others not. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, about 35,000 Irish have emigrated legally to the United States, 
while about 40,000 more have overstayed their tourist visas and stayed 
illegally to work and live, according to figures provided by the Irish 
Consulate in San Francisco. All told, more than 175,000 have left the country 
in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Best guesses within Orange County's Irish community are that several thousand 
illegal Irish make their homes here. 
</P>
<P>
While most recent immigrants are from the Republic of Ireland, others have come 
from Northern Ireland. Though that country, part of the United Kingdom, is torn 
by political and religious unrest, recently arrived Northern Ireland nationals 
interviewed for this article say they came for jobs, just as their brethren to 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they form an almost invisible network -- the women working largely as 
live-in domestic help, the men in construction. 
</P>
<P>
Conor (not his real name) is one who came to Huntington Beach. He decided it 
was time to leave his County Meath home in the Republic of Ireland nearly five 
years ago, after placing number 2,400 out of more than 4,000 who took a civil 
service exam. 
</P>
<P>
The number of job openings? Six. 
</P>
<P>
"The early '80s were a bad time for Ireland," Conor said. About two-thirds of 
those with whom he graduated left the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Irish men here illegally, Conor works in construction. He started in 
New York City, but headed west with a friend when the cold and grime became too 
much. Many of the illegal Irish, Conor said, hold college degrees, but cannot 
hope to land better-paying jobs because of their undocumented status. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people here, well-educated, that are wasting their careers in 
construction because they're not legal and can't get the jobs they're trained 
for," Conor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in the habit of being sneaky," confessed Niaiamh Smythe, who came to 
Southern California on a tourist visa, planning to stay just three months 
before returning to college in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to school from 7 in the morning to 10 at night, and when summer 
came -- and summer in Ireland isn't very summery -- I said, 'OK, I'll go to 
California and get skinny and tan and come back in fall,' " Smythe said. "That 
was 4 1/2 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Being an undocumented alien did not keep her from getting a job with a jeweler 
as a diamond appraiser, work she had done back home. But then the new 
immigration law passed in 1986, requiring employers to get proof of legal 
status from employees. Too embarrassed to tell her employers she was here 
illegally, Smythe told them she had been called back home because her mother 
had been in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
She has since started the paper work to become legal. When she started, she was 
told all she needed was $2,000 and a sponsor, but so far the process has taken 
three years and cost $3,500. She still does not have her green card, but she 
does have a labor certificate to allow her to work while she continues the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Smythe and most other Irish illegals didn't qualify for the amnesty program 
because they hadn't been in the country long enough. 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining legal status requires a sponsor, a job and enough money to pay a 
lawyer to get through the Immigration and Naturalization Service red tape. Once 
an application has been approved, the applicant must go through interviews at 
the American Embassy in the country of origin. For Smythe, that means flying 
back to Dublin once she is given notice to appear. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Smythe is working as a nanny in Long Beach and studying at the 
university there for a music and drama degree. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret (not her real name), 26, is also a Dubliner and a nanny for a 
Huntington Beach family. She has been here four years and has applied for a 
Donnelly visa, a special visa for west Europeans dispensed by lottery. But she 
does not have a lawyer or any plans to hire one. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is in no hurry because she is so attached to the family for which 
she works. She is paid $250 a week, plus gas money for her car and all her 
phone bills and room and board. She has two charges, a teen-age boy and a 
5-year-old girl. The girl attends school in the morning and Margaret is free to 
go her own way. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is happy with her present situation, that was not the case with 
the family that flew her from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them just look for slave labor -- they don't care if you don't have a 
green card," Margaret said. "When I first came I made $90 a week plus room and 
board, but they wanted someone to cook their meals and clean (the house) and 
watch the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Helping young Irish women who have come over as nannies is a job Monica Keogh 
has been doing for years. As founding president of the Orange County chapter of 
the Ancient Order of Hibernian, she has aided young women in finding jobs and 
networking with other Irish in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The order, she said, was founded in the 1800s "for the protection of priests 
and domestics at a time when the Irish were facing great discrimination in this 
country," Keogh said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, John, came to California more than 30 years ago from their 
native Ireland when John was transfered by the aerospace firm where he worked. 
They moved from Northern California to Huntington Beach eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Though she never had to face being an illegal immigrant, Keogh said she 
understands the difficulties of being an undocumented worker from the young 
women she has met over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"To be young and illegal is terrible. Their life style does not allow them to 
flourish," she said with a sigh. She has many tales of young Irish who have 
been victimized because of their illegal status. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of young men starting painting businesses and then not being paid 
when the job is done because the contractor found they were illegal," Keogh 
said. Some girls she knows "after five years are being paid $80 a week and 
giving money to their employers for a lawyer, and still don't have a green 
card," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, though, Orange County's financial and recreational opportunities 
are enough to keep Conor and others working here -- at least for the time 
being. But all the undocumented Irish interviewed for this story talk of 
returning home someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably stay in the States awhile. It's a great place to spend your 
20s," Conor said. "But when you're thinking of settling down, Ireland's a 
better country for raising your kids. That sounds terrible -- what I mean is, 
you always want your kids to be reared the same way you were reared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Living here but planning to return home someday can keep some of the Irish from 
getting into serious relationships with Americans. One woman said she was 
engaged to an American for a time, but the differences in culture put a strain 
on them and the relationship ended. 
</P>
<P>
What are the differences? Most of the Irish interviewed, used to the tight 
social fabric of friends and neighbors back home, said they felt Americans were 
less sincere in their relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Here couples get married and the first sign of frustration they get a 
divorce," Conor said. Divorce is still illegal in Ireland after a recent ballot 
measure to legalize it failed. 
</P>
<P>
Another Irishman said Californians take friendship too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"They're your friend this week, in a month they move on," he said. "Back home 
you know you can count on a friend to stand by you in a rough time." 
</P>
<P>
Feelings of isolation are not confined to undocumented Irish, but are shared by 
many of the newly arrived who come legally. 
</P>
<P>
"Particularly in Ireland, the sense of community, the attachment, are much 
stronger than you would find here," said Cairen Murtagh of Newport Beach. His 
wife, Deirdre, agreed: "One is far more anonymous here." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the Murtaghs would seem a shining immigrant success story. A 
scant 14 months after arriving from Ireland, the couple enjoy well-paying jobs 
in their chosen fields -- he as a research chemist, she as a financial analyst 
-- and make their home in an upscale Newport Beach condominium within sight of 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Still, memories of the life left behind have proved hard to shake. Once, the 
Murtaghs talked about applying for U.S. citizenship after the minimum five 
years; now, they believe they might return home one day. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish to view Ireland with totally rose-colored glasses," 
allowed Deirdre, 32. But, she said, "It seems most people we talk to talk about 
going back." 
</P>
<P>
Although the economy in the Republic of Ireland has stabilized somewhat, jobs 
there remain scarce. Many Irish in Orange County plan to stay at least for a 
time and are doing their best to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
The Murtaghs are helping to create an Irish Network in Southern California, 
patterned after one in the San Francisco Bay Area. The organization, with 120 
members so far (about 20 of them in Orange County), publishes a membership 
directory and organizes events. A recent talk drew more than 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be mostly of interest to the recently arrived," said Cairen 
Murtagh, although he estimates about 25% of the group's members are 
Irish-Americans. The network, which provides a chance to make both business and 
social contacts, is an attempt to create an Irish sense of community in 
fast-paced Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's working out that way," Murtagh, 39, said. "Our social life has picked up 
considerably." 
</P>
<P>
Leonore Coyne is an Irish-American who has come up with her own way to bring 
the community together. She put together a two-day Irish fair, held earlier 
this month in Laguna Beach, with authentic food, entertainment and contests. 
The event raised money for Straight Ahead Inc., a residential drug abuse 
program in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring back the times when I was very young," Coyne explained. Her 
father was an Irishman, and when Leonore was a youngster in Los Angeles, "every 
week he would bring me and my brother to these Irish dances at places that 
aren't even there any more." 
</P>
<P>
The Brothers of St. Patrick Novitiate in Midway City has become one network for 
the Irish in Orange County. Brother Edwin Guidera, himself an Irishman, is 
active in trying to establish an Irish youth center along with Keogh. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons the novitiate has attracted the Irish is through the Irish 
soccer leagues that play their games on the brothers' field. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them use the field in exchange for fund-raising support," said Brother 
Edwin, as he is most often called. 
</P>
<P>
Because the novitiate has become a meeting place for the Irish, Brother Edwin 
has organized events specifically for them. To mark St. Patrick's Day, Sunday's 
Mass will be said in Gaelic -- complete with a locally based Gaelic choir -- 
and a celebration will follow. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the biggest social centers for local Irish remain the pubs -- 
especially the Harp Inn. The Costa Mesa pub offers live Irish entertainment 
three nights a week, along with lessons in Irish dancing and Gaelic, and 
sponsors several sports teams: Irish and English soccer, hurling and Gaelic 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Videos of soccer games from back home are played on the pub's televisions, as 
are Irish newscasts broadcast weekly by a Los Angeles television station. Some 
American sports are popular too -- especially Notre Dame football. The Harp has 
darts and Guiness beer on tap -- it doesn't have pool tables, video games or a 
jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
And though the conversation flows, two topics stay largely off-limits: 
"Politics and religion are things that we don't discuss," says Mackey. While 
people keep informed on the situation in Northern Ireland, they keep their 
opinions on the matter -- and any affiliations to the combatants -- to 
themselves, according to Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a unique place in Orange County. It's not a yuppie bar," says 
Greg Kelley, an Irish-American who convenes local meetings of a Notre Dame 
alumni club at the Harp. "It's just a friendly Irish pub." 
</P>
<P>
Denis Murray and Terry McCarten are the Mulligans, an Irish music duo that has 
played pubs throughout Southern California for 10 years. The Mulligans also 
have some rock songs in their repertory, but can leave those aside when they 
play the Harp every Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you have a real crowd when they just want the Irish stuff," McCarten 
said. "We get a great response from the crowd here." 
</P>
<P>
Set next to an industrial park behind Newport Boulevard, the Harp is easy to 
miss. But its reputation hasn't suffered -- it has even been written up in a 
small-town Irish newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason or another, they're pretty quick to find it," owner Mackey 
said of his customers. Though the Harp is just 2 years old, a number of 
marriages have already come of meetings there. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, who first toured California as part of an Irish soccer team and fell in 
love with the weather, moved here from County Armagh in Ireland 10 years ago. 
"It's a big culture shock coming to the U.S. for the first time," he said. The 
Harp, he said, "gives them a little bit of the old sod."

   She Puts Celtic Fringe on Country Music Charts

<LP>
   Just hours before winning a Grammy, country singer Kathy
Mattea reminisced about her first meeting two years earlier
with her current musical hero. "We went to the show and we
were doing the whole bit about trying to get backstage. It
was such a role reversal," she said. "I felt like a groupie."
   Ms. Mattea, one of the hottest names in Nashville, wasn't
trying to crash the dressing room of a country music great
like George Jones or Loretta Lynn. The musician she was so
eager to meet was an obscure Scottish folk singer named
Dougie McLean.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Mattea described her backstage visit as a musical
turning point. She and her husband escorted Mr. McLean around
Nashville the next day and the following year paid him a
return visit in the Scottish lowlands. Mr. McLean's quietly
passionate Scottish traditionalism permeates her latest
album. While downing a club sandwich on the day of the Grammy
awards, she pushed aside thoughts of her impending award in
her enthusiasm for his music. When they parted company in
Nashville, she said, "I burst into tears. There was so much
more I wanted to say."
   Ms. Mattea isn't the only one in Nashville who is finding
a lot to say to spiritual cousins across the water.
Performers who have brought new vigor to American country
music by returning to its old-time roots recognize their
counterparts in the musical revival sweeping Europe's "Celtic
fringe." From Scotland's Outer Hebrides to the Britanny
Peninsula in France, young performers are finding an
international audience for an eclectic mix of very old tunes
and very pop styles. Popular groups such as DeDannan, the
Tannahill Weavers and Kornog perform ancient songs in Gaelic,
Erse and Breton side by side with original folk and
rock-tinged compositions, and their taste in instrumentation
is omnivorous. The distinctive combination of hard-driving
rhythm and aching melody stands a thousand miles closer to
the Celtic heart than the "green trash" of the St. Patrick's
Day beer bust.
   American country music itself grows out of Scots-Irish
roots, so maybe it's not surprising that the two movements
would intersect. What is remarkable is the intense emotion
that the contact arouses in some of Nashville's leading
performers.
   Ricky Skaggs, a former Country Music Association
Entertainer of the Year, has warm memories of a visit to
Dublin's Society to Preserve Irish Folk Music. "Even the
flavor of the food tasted so much like being at home in
eastern Kentucky," he says. "The music was much alike. We
didn't want to leave them."
   Folk-influenced country singers such as Emmylou Harris and
Nanci Griffith made the Irish pilgrimage in recent years,
bringing back material for their albums. Even pop superstar
Dolly Parton, a far more richly faceted talent than her
marketing would indicate, startled a recent interviewer by
confessing to a secret urge to spend a month in Ireland.
   The traffic is two-way. On a trip to Erin, the bluegrass
banjo star Bela Fleck befriended a soprano from County Clare
named Maura O'Connell and helped persuade her to settle in
Nashville. With a haunting bluesy voice once featured with
the Irish folk-revival group DeDannan, Ms. O'Connell cut two
albums with Warner Bros. This year, she received a Grammy
nomination in the contemporary folk category. Other Irish
singers are following. Mary Black, another lead vocalist with
DeDannan, recently signed with Curb Records. Daniel
O'Donnell, who has placed seven albums at once on the U.K.
top 20, is Britain's leading native country singer. He has
begun recording in Nashville with Ms. Mattea's producer and
starts a major American tour next month. American country
music in general finds its strongest following in the U.K. in
the Celtic regions.
   Even before they began to migrate, the musicians were
learning from each other. Growing up in a family of Irish
fishmongers, Ms. O'Connell was so inundated by traditional
music that she got sick of it, and started her career singing
Bonnie Raitt blues covers. She says she began to rediscover
her roots when she heard Emmylou Harris, the high priestess
of American traditionalism, on an Irish tour.
   But fans have done even more than the musicians to bring
Celtic music to America. Wendy Newton of Weston, Conn.,
visited Ireland 16 years ago and was smitten by the fiddle
music she heard one afternoon in a pub. Returning home, she
started the independent Green Linnet label to distribute
Irish records in the U.S. Her roster now includes many of the
best known Celtic groups, such as Ireland's Altan and
Scotland's Tannahill Weavers and Silly Wizard.
   Perhaps no one has spread the Celtic revival further,
however, than Fiona Ritchie, originator of the weekly
National Public Radio program "Thistle &amp; Shamrock." Her
lilting half-brogue has introduced thousands not only to the
Irish and Scottish music of the title, but to the Celtic
sounds of Brittany and French Canada. A former exchange
student at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, Ms.
Ritchie started the program for the local public radio in
1983. It is now broadcast on 223 stations. Ms. Ritchie also
brought Ms. Mattea face to face with her hero, Mr. McLean.
   Ms. Mattea fell in love with the music years before when a
friend lent her one of Mr. McLean's hard-to-find tapes.
Through a music journalist she met in London, she sent word
that if Mr. McLean ever came to the U.S., he'd find a fan in
Nashville. Several months later, Ms. Ritchie called with news
that Mr. McLean and fellow performers on his independent
Dunkeld Records label were coming to town on a tour organized
by "Thistle &amp; Shamrock." Ms. Mattea not only got to meet Mr.
McLean, she and her husband, Grammy-winning songwriter Jon
Vezner, provided tour buses for the last leg of his trip.
   Mr. McLean left them with an invitation to visit Scotland,
and Ms. Mattea took it up at her first chance. "We had no
idea if they were going to think, `Oh God, the crazy
Americans are coming across the ocean,'" she said. "But they
were just great." Their collaboration "just sort of
happened," she said, "because we were there."
   Ms. Mattea and her husband found themselves helping Mr.
McLean prepare a local music festival called "Event in a
Tent." "Dougie and Jon were out two days before the festival
happened, digging the hole for the loo with a backhoe," Ms.
Mattea recalled.
   "In the rain," added Mr. Vezner.
   Ms. Mattea was thoroughly charmed by the simplicity of
life in Mr. McLean's native Perthshire, in the Scottish
lowlands. "It was the way people ought to live," she said.
Like other pilgrims to the Celtic lands, she was also deeply
impressed by the uncommercial approach to the music. "We'd be
talking about some instrument," she said of a recording
session at Dunkeld, "and Dougie would put it in my hands and
say, well, go play this. In Nashville, so many times, we
would just send for the percussionist.
   "It gave me a much more organic kind of involvement with
the record," she said. "When I got back to Nashville, I found
I was much less intimidated. I was able to express my own
vision better."
   The influence shines through Ms. Mattea's remarkable new
album, "Time Passes By" (PolyGram). She performs with Mr.
McLean on one of his own songs, inspired by his grandfather's
work as a fisherman. They pull out all the stops on a Celtic
setting of Julie Gold's "From a Distance," bringing in
Highland pipes, bodhran and digeridoo. (The latter, the root
of an Australian gum tree hollowed out by ants, is actually
an aborigine instrument, but in Mr. McLean's hands, its
"grumbly buzz" melds nicely with the beloved drone of the
bagpipe.) Even cuts done in Nashville show the impact of the
Scottish sojourn. They startle the listener with an unadorned
passion contrasting sharply with the standard Music Row
product.
   The album breaks the Nashville mold to the extent that Ms.
Mattea at first worried about its reception. But after two
weeks it's No. 27 on Billboard's country music chart and
rising. Apparently the Celtic fringe is a nice addition to
her rhinestone suit.

<HEAD>Thatcher Rebukes Ireland over Shooting Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Margaret Thatcher rebuked Ireland on Tuesday for
conducting its own investigation of the death of a man killed by a
gunshot from a British army observation post just inside Northern
Ireland.
   The prime minister said she did ``not think it right or
possible'' under the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement for the Irish
Republic to investigate the shooting Sunday of Aidan McAnespie, 23,
in the British province.
   During the House of Commons question-and-answer period, she
declared: ``The Irish government can inquire into anything they
wish, but not of course into matters north of the border.'' The
Anglo-Irish accord gives Ireland an advisory role in the Northern
Ireland affairs in an effort to redress grievances of Roman
Catholics in the Protestant-dominated province.
   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks appeared likely to worsen relations,
already strained by disputes that include Britain's refusal to
prosecute police officers involved in the shooting deaths of six
unarmed Catholics in 1982.
   The British army also disclosed Tuesday that a soldier given
life in prison for the shooting death of a Catholic in Belfast had
been freed and returned to his regiment after serving three years.
   Reports that Pvt. Ian Richard Thain was back in uniform,
although not in Northern Ireland, provoked sharp responses from
leaders of the province's Catholic minority.
   Thain was convicted of fatally shooting Thomas Reilly, road
manager of the pop group Bananarama, on Aug. 9, 1983. He claimed in
court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed
Reilly was about to pull a gun.
   The judge found him ``deliberately untruthful.'' Thain was the
first soldier sentenced to life in prison for actions in Northern
Ireland.
   An army statement said Thain was 18 at the time and, ``while the
army in no way condones his action, we consider the incident to
have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very
difficult circumstances.''
   The Home Office said Thain was released on a life license, a
form of parole under which he can be returned to prison ``should
his behavior give rise to concern.''
   A security cordon ringed the town of Aughnacloy for McAnespie's
funeral Tuesday. He was buried across the border in the Irish
Republic.
   The Irish government sent Eugene Crowley, deputy police
commissioner, to the border town of Monaghan to investigation
McAnespie's death. Protestant politicans called the Irish inquiry
unwarranted interference by a foreign government in Northern
Ireland's affairs.
   McAnespie supported Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army. He was killed by a bullet from a
British army observation tower at a checkpoint near Aughnacloy in
County Tyrone, half a mile from the border.
   Relatives said he was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game
and had passed through the checkpoint.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the
soldier told interrogators the shooting was an accident. He was in
military custody Tuesday.
