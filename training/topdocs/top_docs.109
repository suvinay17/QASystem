RANDY LEWIS: SUMMER BRINGS CONCERT LOUTS OUT FROM UNDER THEIR ROCK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RANDY LEWIS

<TEXT>
<P>
Summer is upon us once again, bringing with it a seasonal pest that even
repeated malathion sprayings haven't been able to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
It's known as the rock lout, a subspecies of the genus Homo imbecilus that also
includes such near relatives as the opera hummer ("Dum dum de dump dump, dump
de dump de dum") and the movie talker ("You'll love this movie, baby, honest --
Norman dresses up as his own mother!").
</P>
<P>
A co-worker raised the ugly issue after an encounter with a textbook rock lout
last weekend at Don Henley's concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
Henley's show, on the last leg of a tour that stopped at the Pacific
Amphitheatre last fall, was an intelligent and sophisticated effort to touch on
a variety of serious issues, from loss of innocence (both individually and
culturally) to bureaucratic incompetence.
</P>
<P>
My colleague got steamed at a couple of young women seated near him who kept
shouting requests for the few Henley hits they were familiar with ("Do 'The
Boys of Summmmmmmmmer'!!!"), rather than take the blatantly obvious path and
pay attention to the songs he was singing.
</P>
<P>
Oh, you'll also encounter these oafs indoors, but for some reason, the degree
to which they become a real nuisance seems to increase exponentially in any
facility that doesn't have a lid on it.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the balmy summer nights.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the exhilarating sight of a thousand points of light dotting the
blanket of blue velvet up above.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the beers.
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, the rest of us jerks who ignorantly mind our own business must
find what little comfort we can in remembering Woody Allen's plea in "Annie
Hall," when confronted with a pseudo-intellectual chatterbox next to him in a
movie-theater line, for "a large sock filled with manure."
</P>
<P>
My personal favorite experience with the despoiling effect a rock lout can have
on a performance goes back a couple of years, when Linda Ronstadt was doing her
'40s-themed tours of big-band music. During her concert at the Pacific
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, there was a particularly delicate moment when she
was in the midst of a ballad; as I recall it was the Gershwins' melancholy
"Someone to Watch Over Me."
</P>
<P>
Dressed impeccably in a period gown, her hair tastefully swept up in a snood,
Ronstadt looked longingly up into the single beam of soft blue light that
gently illuminated her face. As the strings of the Nelson Riddle orchestra sang
ever so sweetly, and Ronstadt prepared to deliver the next verse of this lonely
lover's plea, up from the audience a voice came bellowing:
</P>
<P>
"Rock and Rolllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!"
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, are you a complete moron or are you still working on it?
</P>
<P>
Do people like this see a marquee that reads: "Linda Ronstadt and the Nelson
Riddle Orchestra" and buy tickets thinking it's really a secret code for Motley
Crue?
</P>
<P>
Or do they, perhaps, expect that after blaring out their request so tastefully
that maybe Linda is suddenly going to drop her hand, turn to the band and say
"OK, boys -- gimme 'Whole Lotta Love' in A and let's kick some butt this time!"
</P>
<P>
I'm all for fans showing their appreciation for a good performance, but all too
often a small handful of -- how can I put it delicately? -- cretins can
diminish enjoyment for the majority with their particular brand of celebrating.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if everyone observed the following simple guidelines, there would be
fewer sad cases like my colleague, who now argues that in terms of civility,
the human race reached its zenith somewhere between the Bronze Age and the
Worsted-Tweed Age.
</P>
<P>
* If you want to be assured of hearing all of Neil Young's hits some evening,
don't shout for them at his concert. Stay home and play the records.
</P>
<P>
* If you feel the need to party all night long to your favorite Michael Jackson
songs, don't stand up and shake your body down to the ground in front of all
your comfortably seated neighbors. Stay home and play the records.
</P>
<P>
* If you want to prove that you know the words to every one of Bonnie Raitt's
songs -- even the one's before the "Nick of Time" album -- don't assume that
everyone else at the concert wants to hear you, not Bonnie, sing them. Stay
home and play the records.
</P>
<P>
* Lastly, if you feel you simply must establish a personal bond with your
favorite sensitive artiste, don't cry out, "We love you, Axl!" during a tender
ballad. Observe the advice of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn -- "If you want to
send a message, use Western Union."
</P>
<P>
Better yet, stay home and play the records.
</P>
<P>
 Randy Lewis' column moves to Fridays beginning next week.

<TEXT>
   Pop singer Stevie Wonder's Academy
Award-winning song ``I Just Called To Say I Love You'' was written
by two other people and stolen by Wonder after it was played for
him, a lawyer charged.
   Songwriter Lloyd Chiate, 40, claims he and collaborator Lee
Garrett wrote the song in the 1970s and titled it ``I Just Called
To Say.'' Wonder says he wrote the song himself before the pair
composed their song.
   Wonder, who was born Steveland Morris, is being sued in federal
court for alleged copyright infringement by Chiate.
   ``We are going to prove to you that Mr. Morris took the song
written by Mr. Chiate and Mr. Garrett for his own benefit ... and
Mr. Chiate received nothing,'' attorney Herbert Dodell said
Wednesday in opening statements as Wonder sat in the courtroom.
   But Wonder's attorney, Howard King, said the pop star wrote the
song's chorus on July 16, 1976, as he returned from a visit with
his mother in the San Fernando Valley, before Chiate and Garret
ever met.
   He said Wonder completed the song in 1984 after hearing part of
the soundtrack to the film ``The Woman in Red.''
   King added that Garrett, who dropped out as a plaintiff in the
case, has acknowledged that Wonder actually wrote the song.

   A federal jury Thursday rejected a $25
million claim that pop star Stevie Wonder's Oscar-winning 1984 song
``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen from another
songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was stolen from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder, who
attended the two-week trial and testified on his own behalf. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing a
song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said. ``It is far easier to
love than to hate.''
   Chiate, 40, sued Wonder in 1985 under the superstar's real name,
Steveland Morris, for copyright infringement, claiming that Wonder
pilfered ``I Just Called To Say,'' co-written by Lee Garrett, after
Wonder heard the song in 1977.
   Wonder, 39, denied stealing the song, which won an Academy Award
in 1984. He said he wrote ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' long
before hearing the Chiate-Garrett composition and without any
influence from the song.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict. His
attorney said his client was wronged by a star-struck jury and a
biased judge who had originally dismissed the lawsuit but was
overruled by an appeals court.
   ``I don't think that Mr. Chiate ever got a fair trial,'' said
lawyer Herbert Dodell. ``The result was inevitable, a terrible
miscarriage of justice.''
   Jury foreman Robert Apfelzweig, 39, a research scientist from
Pasadena, said the jury didn't find any evidence that Wonder had
access to the Chiate-Garrett song and the two songs were ``quite
dissimilar.''
   ``Mr. Chiate's case started weak and got weaker,'' said
Apfelzweig.
   Chiate contended that Wonder first had access to Chiate and
Garrett's music during the summer of 1977, when Garrett played
Wonder a tape recording of his music after the latter had talked
Garrett out of committing suicide one night.
   Garrett and Wonder are boyhood friends. Garrett originally was
named as a plaintiff in the suit, but he dropped out and testified
for Wonder.
   Wonder testified in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge David
W. Williams that he wrote much of ``I Just Called to Say I Love
You'' on July 16, 1976, while being driven from his mother's San
Fernando Valley home.
   It was at least a year, perhaps two, before he heard the song
Chiate and Garrett wrote, he said.
   Wonder said that he later polished and recorded ```I Just Called
to Say I Love You,'' which became a big hit and also won a Grammy.

POP STAR AND WRITER IN DISCORD OVER SONG
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pop singer-composer Stevie Wonder, accused in a lawsuit of stealing the song "I
Just Called to Say I Love You," testified Thursday in federal court that he got
the idea for the hit tune in 1976 while being driven to a hotel in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Wonder, 39, who is in the Songwriters' Hall of Fame and has sold millions of
records, said he created "enough of a working idea for a verse and a chorus"
during the ride to make a recording of the song the same day -- but that he
changed the tune over the years and did not record its final version until
1984.
</P>
<P>
In a $25-million copyright infringement lawsuit filed in Los Angeles,
songwriter Lloyd Chiate claims that Wonder pilfered a song that Chiate had
written in 1976 and converted it into the tune that won a Grammy Award and an
Academy Award in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Chiate, 40, is a successful songwriter in his own right who has written for the
Fifth Dimension, Billy Davis Jr., Marilyn McCoo, Eddie Money and Wonder
himself.
</P>
<P>
Wonder, the first witness called to the stand, said he had left his mother's
home in the San Fernando Valley and was on his way to Hollywood when the song
came to him.
</P>
<P>
The blind singer, who was born Stevland Morris, acknowledged under oath that
"various things changed throughout the years" on the song, as they frequently
do when he is working on one.
</P>
<P>
"I never completed the song," Wonder said, in response to questioning from
Chiate's lawyer Herbert Dodell. "I never felt it was complete until I recorded
it in 1984."
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black-and-brown checked jacket and turtleneck sweater and with his
hair tied in a ponytail, Wonder compared his song-writing process to the way a
painter creates a painting.
</P>
<P>
However, Dodell presented a different account in his opening statement
Wednesday before U.S. District Judge David W. Williams. The case is being heard
by a six-member jury.
</P>
<P>
The attorney said Chiate and a partner, Lee Garrett, composed a song called
"Hello It's Me, I Just Called to Say" in 1976 that is "strikingly similar" to
Wonder's hit.
</P>
<P>
Dodell said that Garrett, an old friend of Wonder's who also is blind, played a
tape of the song for Wonder in 1977 after Wonder stopped a depressed Garrett
from committing suicide. Asked about the incident Thursday, Wonder said he
"honestly" could not remember what was discussed that day.
</P>
<P>
Chiate and Garrett registered a song called "I Just Called to Say" with
Broadcast Music Inc. in 1979.
</P>
<P>
They sued Wonder in 1985, but Garrett dropped out of the lawsuit a year later.
Dodell said Garrett had made a deal with Wonder in which he gave him a license
to use the song "I Just Called to Say" in return for money and musical
equipment. Garrett is expected to testify for Wonder at the trial.
</P>
<P>
Dodell pressed Wonder on a letter that Wonder supposedly wrote to the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1984 using the name Stevland Morris. The
letter states that Wonder wrote the song in 1984, making it eligible for an
Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
Wonder denied writing the letter. He said it had been written by a lawyer who
no longer represents him.
</P>
<P>
Wonder is scheduled to resume his testimony today.

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning composer Sammy Fain, whose
classic love ballads included ``Love is a Many Splendored Thing''
and ``I'll be Seeing You,'' has died of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Fain, who was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two, died
Wednesday at the UCLA Medical Center, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of America's most memorable
pop hits.
   Many Fain titles bring instant recognition: ``Secret Love,''
``Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up
That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night'' among them.
   `` `I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
ASCAP President Morton Gould said of the World War II song. ``It's
hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He was such a
sweet person, such a gentle person.''
   Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator, said his
friend leaves ``not just a few but a staggering medley of hits,
songs that are readily identifiable to everyone.''
   He added: ``You know, old songwriters never really die because
their songs keep them alive forever.''
   Fain's collaborators included lyricists Cahn, Irving Kahal, Bob
Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis Webster, Mitchell
Parish, E.Y. Harburg, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said Parish in a telephone interview from New
York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets.
   ``Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of
our songs ... That explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain won Oscars for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love Is
a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from the
Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York on June 17, 1902, Fain was a
piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed
Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash 1938 review
``Hellzapoppin.''
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that year, ``I'll Be Seeing
You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime classics.
The latter was recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York.

<TEXT>     Mrs. Kaye, the widow of actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for
many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man"
(1945), "The Kid From Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"
(1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).;   A
native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied
music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in
Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman
and Danny Kaye.;   There she began writing specialty material, including a
Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Danny Kaye. In 1940,
the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue.";
  That year, she married Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La
Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for
her husband and accompanied him on piano.;   Mrs. Kaye was known for her
complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter
songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines.;   Most frequently
cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three
Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But
Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization.;   "I wrote many songs for
Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but
only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The
Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on
Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect
love song.";   For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely
for her husband. She once estimated she wrote more than 100 songs for him
during their 40-year collaboration. She also was involved in the production of
almost all his films. She was nominated twice for Academy Awards, for her work
on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953).;   In the 1970s,
she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She
began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971
and at Yale University in 1975.;   In 1979, she produced and narrated the
course as a 90-minute Public Broadcasting Service program, "Musical Comedy
Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975, she was executive producer for a
television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and
edited "Assignment Children," a UNICEF film that starred her husband.;   In
the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book
about her life with Danny Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She
also was writing a catalog of show-business material that she and her husband
had donated to the Library of Congress.;   Brooklyn College awarded her an
honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia
Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of
the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.;   Danny Kaye died in 1987 at the
age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television
journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.  </TEXT>

   Academy Award-winning composer Sammy Fain,
who wrote such enduring tunes as ``Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing,'' ``That Old Feeling'' and the wartime classic ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   The two-time Oscar recipient, who suffered a heart attack, was
at the UCLA Medical Center when he died, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most memorable pop
hits of American music this century.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``Let A Smile
Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Wedding Bells Are
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night''
among them.
   ```I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
said ASCAP President Morton Gould of the World War II song.
   ``It's hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He
was such a sweet person, such a gentle person,'' Gould said.
   Fain's collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis
Webster, Mitchell Parish, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg, and Alan and
Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said lyricist Parish in a telephone interview
from New York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets. Workmen, whatever
they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs. ... That
explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain was nominated for 10 Academy Awards during his long career.
He won for best song for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from
the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Known for a self-effacing style, Fain's modesty even extended to
Academy Award politics. When he had a little-heard 1976
Oscar-nominated song, ``A World That Never Was,'' from a
little-seen movie called ``Half a House,'' he said in a trade paper
advertisement: ``It would be nice if we had a commercial record,
but we don't. It would also be nice if we were in a widely seen
motion picture, but we don't have that, either.''
   To make up for those shortcomings, Fain provided a
``Dial-a-Song'' phone number so Academy voters could hear his song.
But the award went to ``Evergreen'' that year.
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902, Fain was
a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until
teaming with lyricist Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows
What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review
``Hellzapoppin'' in 1938.
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that same year, ``I'll Be
Seeing You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime
classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote all the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
lifetime achievement.
   He had been a member of the ASCAP board of directors for the
past 10 years.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

being stripped of all his abilities," he said quietly. (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Academy Award Winning Composer Sammy Fain Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composer Sammy Fain, a two-time Academy Award
winner who wrote ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   Fain died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical Center, said Ken
Sunshine, a publicist for the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most enduring pop
hits of American music this century.
   His collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg
and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing
You,'' ``Wedding Bells are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and
``Tender Is the Night'' among them.
   Fain won his Academy Awards for best song, in the title for the
1955 film ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' and in 1953 for
``Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.'' Fain was
nominated for Oscars nine times during his career.
   He was born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902. A
piano prodigy, he unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with lyricist Kahal for their first hit ``Nobody Knows What a
Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in musical films, then returned to
Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review ``Hellzapoppin'' in
1938.
   Two songs from another failed Fain musical that same year,
``I'll Be Seeing You,'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I'' later became
wartime classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Fain and Hilliard wrote all the songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice
In Wonderland,'' including the tune ``I'm Late.''
   Fain also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's
``Peter Pan.'' After winning his ``Secret Love'' Oscar, Fain
collaborated to write the theme songs for several movies besides
the second Academy Award winner ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing.''
   Those included ``A Certain Smile,'' ``April Love,'' ``The Gift
of Love'' and ``Tender Is the Night.''
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
his lifetime achievement of writing popular music.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Vanwarmer Album `Like Gathering Your Family'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Randy Vanwarmer is
counting on the emotional edge of his new album to stem a nine-year
slide since his million-selling hit ``Just When I Needed You Most.''
   The 33-year-old Vanwarmer has just released ``I Am,'' a
collection of soft country ballads with romantic titles such as ``I
Will Hold You,''``That's What Your Smile Does for Me'' and ``Words
I Never Meant.'' It's his first album in four years.
   ``There's something spiritual about the record,'' Vanwarmer said
in an interview. ``It's kind of like gathering your family around
the fireplace.''
   As a marketing exercise, however, it has been a disaster.
   Instead of Vanwarmer's ``It's a Heartache,'' a tune by pop-jazz
singer Michael Franks, ``The Camera Never Lies,'' was distributed
erroneously with Vanwarmer's name printed on it.
   The mistake was repeated during a second round of distribution,
so record company officials gave up on the song and will switch to
another one, ``Where the Rocky Mountains Touch the Morning Sun.''
   ``The radio stations kept calling and saying, `We like Randy's
record but he's not country enough for our station,''' Vanwarmer
said.
   ``His record is kind of jazz, funky, but we have similar
textured voices. I can almost understand why they almost thought it
was me.''
   His tough luck continues a pattern since his powerful ``Just
When I Needed You Most'' propelled him from obscurity in 1979.
   Instead of establishing himself as a ballad singer, he followed
up with an uptempo tune titled ``Gotta Get Out of Here.''
   ``It did terribly,'' Vanwarmer recalled.
   More than half a dozen singles were released subsequently, but
none was a hit. On the advice of others, he declined to do American
concert tours that would have built up his name and following. A
possible tour with Anne Murray was bypassed.
   Furthermore, his record company wound down, ``and I don't think
they were putting the money behind the records that they needed
to,'' he said.
   ``I don't blame anybody,'' he said about the downfall. ``Maybe
if I had been more knowledgeable. ...
   ``We had one solid record, and then we wanted to change
direction _ something with a little more edge. I wanted to do it;
that was just naivete. My first record seemed so easy. I do ballads
best. We could have done another ballad, but we put out an uptempo
thing.''
   Though he failed to capitalize on the success of ``Just When I
Needed You Most,'' he says his royalties from writing the hit paid
the bills for six years.
   His breakup with his girlfriend inspired the song.
   ``That was kind of devastating,'' he recalled. Six months later,
he sat down and put the song on paper.
   ``I found that those kind of songs, the deepest ones, come some
time after an event. You're too traumatized at the time. When
someone leaves, you just don't go sit down and write a song. If you
did, you'd almost wish bad things would happen to you.''
   He said the song was a hit because listeners related to a lament
over a broken romance. ``It's happened to everyone. That emotion is
universal. Some people like to feel sorry for themselves,'' he said.
   ``I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self pity and it
had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.''
   A footnote about the song is that John Sebastian of the rock
group Lovin' Spoonful played autoharp on the record.
   ``To me, it was one of the things that sold the record,''
Vanwarmer said.
   In 1980, he wrote the song ``It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes,''
which later became a No. 1 hit for the Oak Ridge Boys.
   The song, triggered by the death of his father 13 years earlier,
made its way to the charts in an unusual fashion. The song got into
the hands of Oak Ridge Boys' record producer Ron Chancey, whose
wife fell in love with it after hearing it on a demonstration tape.
It was then recorded by the group as a favor to her, Vanwarmer said.
   ``One perk of being a songwriter is exorcising your feelings as
they come along,'' he said. ``And people can exorcise theirs as
they listen too.''
   He wrote it on Christmas Eve as he sat alone at home before
gathering with family members.
   ``It was emotion from the heart. It wrote itself.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Eddy Raven Flying High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Eddy Raven is working on a streak
of four straight No. 1 country music records.
   But the biggest song with which he's been associated was one he
wrote that took nine years to become a hit and then became a
country classic: ``Thank God for Kids,'' recorded by the Oak Ridge
Boys.
   The 44-year-old Raven is at the peak of a 20-year recording
career. His ``'Till You Cry'' recently reached No. 1 on at least
one of the national country charts, joining his earlier top ranked
``Shine Shine Shine,'' ``I'm Gonna Get You'' and ``Joe Knows How to
Live.''
   Since October 1987, each of his singles has been No. 1. His
first No. 1 record was ``I Got Mexico'' in 1984. Several other
songs of his have been close to the top spot.
   But it was the emotional lyrics of ``Thank God for Kids'' that
probably will make it the most enduring song of his prolific
singing and songwriting career. The impassioned tune sold 1 million
copies for the Oak Ridge Boys in five weeks in 1982, and has become
the theme song for various anti-child abuse campaigns in the seven
years since.
   ``There's stone reality in that song,'' Raven said in an
interview. ``Everybody who's had kids has had KoolAid on the couch.
Every father has tried to fly a kite. And kids ask thousands of
questions.''
   He composed the song at home in 15 minutes in 1973, inspired by
his 3-year-old son, who said he wanted to help his father write
about Mickey Mouse and Big Bird.
   Raven himself recorded the song in 1976 but only as the B-side
of a record. Music industry executives told him the subject matter
just wasn't what country music fans wanted.
   ``I was told country folks don't care about Santa Claus and
Christmas, that they are interested in love and barrooms,'' Raven
said. ``I tried for three years to get that song put out. They said
no.''
   Finally, the song reached the hands of the Oak Ridge Boys who
made it a hit and one of their most requested tunes.
   As a singer, he recently released the album ``Best of Eddy
Raven,'' his top selling LP to date. Due out by summer on the new
Universal label is another album, ``Temporary Sanity.''
   ``We wanted the title to at least stir some excitement from
people: `What has he done now?''' Raven said about the intriguing
title.
   He has a deep, masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in
a style he describes as ``Cajun reggae, Caribbean Cajun, electric
Cajun.''
   ``No one is doing exactly what we're doing,'' he said about his
style.
   ``Someone asked me why I don't do more hard country like Randy
Travis and Ricky Van Shelton. I said, `Why? They do it great and I
can't do it any better than that.'
   ``I want to break some new ground and bring the Cajun heritage a
step farther and a little step up if we can.''
   Raven, a native of Lafayette, La., was the oldest of 10 children
born to a truck driver. He began performing and writing in his
early teens, but has worked in the cotton and rice fields, as a
service station attendant and in a lumberyard. He even ``ran
moonshine'' for a while.
   His first album came out in 1969, making this his 20th year as a
recording artist.
   He said his streak of No. 1 records has made him more aggressive.
   ``They make you fight harder to make a better product. If you
are honest and realize how fleeting they are and how fortunate you
are, it makes you work harder to find that better song and change
that one lyric to make it better.
   ``It also gives you a little more to show for what you've done.
You hang up a No. 1 plaque before you hang up a No. 3 plaque.''
   He attributed part of his recent success to being hard-headed:
``I've always been stubborn. When people made a suggestion, I
always asked why instead of saying OK. But I got a little more
adamant about it. I really analyzed everything a little better.
   ``I had more expertise. I worked a little bit more. I'm able to
draw on a lot more road experience and more of what the public is
listening to.''

REMEMBERING BERLIN -- ALWAYS;
</P>
<P>
'IF YOU'RE A PRO YOU WRITE WHAT YOU GOTTA WRITE'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK HIRSHBERG, Hirshberg, a publicist at Paramount in the 1940s, worked
with Irving Berlin on White Christmas and Blue Skies. Following are
recollections and excerpts of conversations he taped over the years with the
reclusive composer who died Friday at age 101.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had the good fortune to work on an almost daily basis with Irving Berlin for
close to two years at one time, and for other shorter spans. We had many
conversations, some of which I managed to record. This was no minor
accomplishment inasmuch as Berlin, a wiry, supercharged individual, aspired to
assert complete control over any project with which he was associated.
</P>
<P>
He was almost always in motion, seldom remaining seated for more than a few
minutes unless he was at the piano. He preferred to patrol the executive
corridors at Paramount Studios, where we worked, or pace nervously in circles
around his office, frequently in shirt sleeves, lost in introspection, hands
clasped behind his back, torso bent slightly forward as he moved. Like an ice
skater.
</P>
<P>
He was a genial man, as sharp a businessman as he was a beguiling and
perceptive poet.
</P>
<P>
Berlin once told me, with his customary candor, that some of his output "was
trash." Nonetheless, his ability to churn out songs so enchanting and timeless
that their appeal spans generations and socioeconomic strata and national and
racial boundaries is unrivaled in the annals of American music.
</P>
<P>
"Some songs just write themselves," Berlin said. "Take 'Cheek to Cheek,' for
instance. It is quite a long, involved song. I wrote it for Astaire and Rogers
in 'Top Hat.' I did it after dinner one evening while staying at the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, I was not satisfied lyrically with 'Always.' I had the tune
finished for months but couldn't get the lyric right. Then one day I just
ad-libbed it and it worked. For me, lyrics are the hardest part."
</P>
<P>
"There's no special recipe for success," Berlin told me. "Some very good songs
never got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the timing is wrong and a good song dies. It happens to all writers.
In my opinion, Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine' is one of the greatest pieces
of music written by anybody. It was in a show called 'Jubilee' many years ago
and it was a failure until much later Artie Shaw, the big-band leader, made a
recording and everyone suddenly discovered it is a classic.
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'White Christmas' because I had to write a song about Christmas for
the show. I was a good songwriter so I wrote a good song."
</P>
<P>
"There are certain basic emotions, not only in songwriting and play writing but
also in making speeches or writing stories. There's self-pity, which is 'All
Alone' or 'Remember' . . . where you feel sorry for yourself. There's
happiness. There's the straight love song, like 'Always.' There's the homesick
song -- songs about Dixie. There's the patriotic song, such as 'God Bless
America.'
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've written songs that were failures. You can be so clever that
you write around your subject and become oblique. Your pencil becomes so sharp
that you write from the outside rather than the inside.
</P>
<P>
"We're all amateurs until we write a hit, and there are no basic rules. When I
started, we were confined to an octave and maybe a note, although 'Alexander's
Ragtime Band' went beyond that. Then Jerome Kern came along and wrote two
octaves, or an octave and three quarters. It didn't make a darn bit of
difference because Jerome Kern had talent and a heart of gold and he just wrote
great melodies.
</P>
<P>
"I can give you all sorts of rules, but you may go home and break them all and
write the biggest hit ever written.
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pro you write what you gotta write. Someone needs a ballad, you
write a ballad. It's a matter of talent. Some of the biggest hits I've had were
written because we needed a ballad in the publishing house. I've written many
songs because the situation called for a boy and a girl to sing a love song.
</P>
<P>
"Take 'Annie Get Your Gun.' Herbert and Dorothy Fields wrote the book about
Annie Oakley, who was a fantastic rifle shot. The situations called for a love
song, so I wrote 'They Say That Falling in Love Is Wonderful.' I thought that
would be the big hit. We all felt 'I Got the Sun in the Mornin' would be a
rhythm smash.
</P>
<P>
" 'Annie Get Your Gun' has 16 songs. It's a true story. Frank Butler was the
world's greatest marksman with a rifle. But when Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show,
in which Butler starred, came to town, little Annie Oakley beat him. Buffalo
Bill asked Annie to join his show but she didn't want to leave home.
</P>
<P>
"I had to write a song that would sell her on the idea of coming along . . .
the glories of riding on a train. The excitement. I tried to wrap it up in one
phrase, and the phrase was 'There's No Business Like Show Business.' I wrote it
as a throwaway song to advance the story line.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan it as an anthem for show business. But, according to my ASCAP
survey, it is my most-performed song. Not the biggest record seller, but the
most-performed."
</P>
<P>
"If you're a professional songwriter, you write. You write in the morning, you
write at night, you write in a taxi or on the subway. You have it in your mind
until you're finished, and even after it's finished. It may turn out to be very
bad. I have songs written years ago that I'd still like to change.
</P>
<P>
"A professional songwriter doesn't work business hours. He subconsciously
gathers material and ideas all the time. I don't have a notebook filled with
titles or these ideas, but they're tucked away somewhere in memory.
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing about longevity in this business. You don't get
holier-than-thou. You don't give something to the public with the attitude
that, well, here it is and you damn better like it. You try to guess what they
want and then try to please them."
</P>
<P>
"(George M. Cohan) was my ideal," Berlin said. "I tried to write like him. He
was the fellow who supplied special material to the guys who sang in the
saloons when I was a kid. I started by writing parodies of current songs by
other composers -- at first I just wrote lyrics.
</P>
<P>
"When I was a bit older I became a singing waiter, and I want you to know I was
a pretty good one. At least, I thought I was pretty good until we made the
movie version of 'This Is The Army' at Warner Brothers in which I sang 'Oh, How
I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.' An electrician heard my prerecording and said
that if the guy who wrote that song could hear this fellow sing it he'd turn
over in his grave."
</P>
<P>
"My interest is principally in the creation of songs," Berlin once told me.
"But we live in a country and society that is based on free enterprise. Just
try buying a painting by Picasso or Cezanne and see what you'll be charged."
Around 1944, Berlin bought up copyrights to all his songs. They are still owned
by his estate. He refused more than one offer in the hundreds of millions of
dollars for his catalogue, claiming he would not know what to do with the money
and the would-be purchasers would not know what to do with his music.
</P>
<P>
At his death, Berlin was still living in the house on Beekman Place in New York
which he purchased in 1946 from its builder and original owner, the late James
Forrestal, one-time Navy Secretary.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to rent it but we couldn't, so we bought it," he remembered. "It's
on the East River in what is supposed to be a fashionable neighborhood. But the
East River doesn't impress me because they picked me out of the East River when
I was a kid . . . a little lower downtown, perhaps, but still the same river,
tugboats and all."
</P>
<P>
During his life Berlin stubbornly resisted all offers to use his life story as
the basis for a Broadway musical or film. He told me that when he died his
children could make such a decision, if they chose.
</P>
<P>
"My private life is private, but I'll be very happy to talk about it," he said
puckishly. "We have a nice corner house in New York. We spend out summers in
the Catskills, and we go there in winter, too. There's lots of deer up there.
And snow.
</P>
<P>
"I seldom relax. My hobby is songwriting. My wife and I used to go dancing, but
we'd sooner sit and talk. I'm not a good dancer. I'm a very big eater. I like
good food. I like to cook but they tell me I cook badly. I've found if you buy
good meat you should leave it alone -- the same as with a good song. Don't do
too big of an arrangement."
</P>
<P>
Berlin said the most important advice he would offer aspiring songwriters was,
"Never throw anything away."
</P>
<P>
"During World War I, I wrote a song at Camp Upton for a soldier show called
'Yip, Yip Yaphank'," he said. "I intended it as the finale but we didn't use
it. It went into the trunk.
</P>
<P>
"In 1938 I was in London for the opening of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band.' It was
September, near the time Neville Chamberlain came back from meeting Hitler with
his piece of paper about peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
"I was distraught about the threat of war, and when I returned to New York I
wanted to write a patriotic song. I wrote one called 'Thanks, America,' but it
was a very sad song.
</P>
<P>
"But the word 'America' recalled the song I wrote 20 years earlier at Camp
Upton. I hauled it out of the trunk and rewrote it. The first 16 bars and the
last eight are exactly as they were written originally, but I changed the
middle because I wanted to write a song about peace, not about war.
</P>
<P>
"A short time afterwards, when Kate Smith asked me to write a patriotic song
for her, I just gave her the revised version of the old song."
</P>
<P>
Thus was "God Bless America" rescued from the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
"It is my personal favorite song."

When last we talked, Berlin seemed interested in dispelling a myth about his
keyboard ability.
</P>
<P>
"People think I can only play that special piano with the movable keyboard. I
play in the key of F sharp, which are the black keys. Years ago all fakers
played that way. We played by ear, and the publishing companies had these
transposing pianos because we could not transpose. We really could not write
music.
</P>
<P>
"For me F sharp happened because the black keys are right under your fingers.
But as I progressed, I got to know the relative keys. I took lessons once or
twice but I wasn't any good.
</P>
<P>
"George M. Cohan had a couple of transposing pianos. He played in the key of C,
which is also supposed to be easy.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I began composing away from the piano. I developed a system
whereby I envisioned the keyboard in my mind, and I could encode the proper
notes on paper. I work mainly with ideas. I write words and music together, one
phrase at a time. But I can play any piano."
</P>
<P>
Today Berlin's old moveable piano stands mute in the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington.

   The composers who wrote the
Grammy-winning song ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' are aiming their
ambition at another challenge: an Academy Award.
   The touching tune about worshiping loved ones was voted song of
the year in February, earning a Grammy award for co-writers Larry
Henley and Jeff Silbar. The song also was chosen record of the
year, earning another Grammy for Bette Midler.
   The song, performed by Midler in the movie ``Beaches,'' was not
eligible for an Academy Award because it was not written for a
motion picture.
   ``I watched the Academy Awards and thought, `Boy, I'd like to
have one of those,''' Henley said in an interview. ``You get this
award syndrome. It's so much fun to go up on that stage and get an
award.
   ``I'm hopeully going to get more songs in movies. My next goal
is to win the Academy Award.''
   Henley lives in Nashville. Silbar, who lives in Studio City,
Calif., is directing his songwriting toward an Oscar as well.
   ``I'm trying, since the Grammy award, to write with the best
writers I can and write for special projects,'' he said by
telephone.
   Henley and Silbar wrote ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' in 1981 on
Nashville's Music Row. Henley put the finishing touches on the
lyrics the next day as he sat alone on a yacht in the Gulf of
Mexico off Corpus Christi, Texas.
   An estimated 200 singers have recorded the song, with Midler's
version hitting No. 1 on the pop music charts last summer.
   The well-crafted tune, in dramatic and sweeping fashion, is
about one person telling another person that he or she is his or
her hero. The person being addressed is saluted for strength and
willingness to let others reap the glory of life: ``I can fly
higher than an eagle. Because you are the wind beneath my wings.''
   Warner Chappell, which published the song, says it has become
the most performed piece of music at weddings. It also is played
often at funerals.
   ``It gets people coming and going,'' Henley said.
   Silbar refers to it as ``the ultimate thank you song.''
   ``People have been looking for the words to say this and the
song just kind of crystallizes their thoughts,'' he said. ``The
stories I hear about it are wonderful: The song is dedicated to
fathers, brothers, husbands. It goes the whole boundaries of
relationships and how people feel to each other.''
   Henley says, ``It's become a catch phrase in America. I'm very
proud of that. I think that's one of the things hardly anyone ever
writes.''
   Both writers said the song fit well in ``Beaches,'' a movie
about friendship, even though the tune was written years before the
movie was conceived and was first a hit record by Gary Morris in
the country music field.
   ``The spot in the movie was the ultimate for a ballad,'' Silbar
said.
   ``It worked wonderfully in the movie,'' Henley said. ``It was
sort of a `Terms of Endearment' kind of movie. It was funny, then
it makes you want to cry. It leaves you with a very special
feeling.''
   Henley primarily wrote the lyrics, which is ironic because such
moving sentiments came from someone married and divorced four times.
   ``I've been single now for about 10 years,'' he said. ``I think
I've learned my lesson.''
   One of his ex-wives, who inspired the song, called him with
congratulations the night the Grammy Awards were announced.
   ``She's thrilled I'm sure,'' Henley said. ``She was one of the
heroes in my life. I've always been grateful for some of the things
she taught me.''
   Henley owns a place in music trivia. He'll probably always be
known for co-writing ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' but in the 1960s he
was lead singer for the Newbeats rock 'n' roll group. It was his
falsetto on such hits as ``Bread and Butter'' in 1964, and ``Run,
Baby, Run'' in 1965.
   ``I think my story has been sort of interesting, from `Bread and
Butter' to `Wind Beneath My Wings' by way of country music,'' he
mused. ``From rock 'n' roll to country to pop. It's sort of a
strange route.''
   His fondest memory from the Newbeats is doing a concert tour
with the Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison in Australia and New
Zealand.
   ``It was the most fun I ever had,'' Henley recalled. ``We had
the world in our hands and didn't even know it.''

   Jane Fonda paid a surprise visit, incognito,
to two of East Germany's most polluted cities to voice her support
for environmentalists there.
   Fonda said she went to see Europe's ``dirtiest and most
polluted'' cities for herself, the official East German news agency
ADN quoted her as saying Wednesday.
   The Oscar-winning actress, well known for her political
activism, disguised herself during the visit with a pair of
sunglasses, ADN said.
   Fonda visited Bitterfeld and Wolfen in the heart of East
Germany's main industrial area, about 75 miles from Berlin.
   Scientists have said the area, with huge chemical plants and
coal-fired power plants, is one of the most dangerously polluted in
Europe.

   Paine College officials were caught off
guard when actor Danny Glover announced he will set up a $100,000
endowment at the school from which his mother graduated.
   ``We did not expect this magnanimity,'' President Julius S.
Scott said this week, calling the gift an indication of Glover's
``character and love of family.''
   Glover, star of such movies as ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``The Color
Purple,'' announced the endowment in honor of Carrie Hunley Glover
when he spoke at the college's Founders Day convocation and
received an honorary degree Friday.
   Paine College is a private, predominantly black school
established in 1882. Mrs. Glover, who earned a bachelor's degree in
science and home economics in 1942, was the first college graduate
in her family.

   A music professor says he believes Stevie
Wonder may have copied his Oscar-winning hit ``I Just Called to Say
I Love You'' from another songwriter's tune without realizing it.
   Milton Stern, a professor from California State University, Los
Angeles, testified Tuesday in a $25 million copyright-infringement
suit filed against Wonder by sonwriter Lloyd Chiate 1985.
   Stern said the hit was ``extraordinarily similar'' to a song
Chiate wrote with Lee Garrett. ``One is based on the other,'' he
said. ``One is a progression.''
   Chiate, 40, has testified he wrote the song ``I Just Called to
Say'' in 1976 and the following year played a tape of it for
Wonder. He did not register the song until 1979.
   Wonder, 39, has testified that he began writing his song in 1976
and completed it in 1984.

   Singing has always been Hovie Lister's stock in
trade, but the gospel artist likes politics enough to spend his
winter days opening doors for Georgia senators.
   Lister, 64, who sang at the funerals of Hank Williams and Elvis
Presley, is an assistant doorkeeper for the Senate this year, a job
he sought from music fan Zell Miller, the lieutenant governor. It
pays about $1,800 per session.
   ``I just love politics,'' Lister said.
   The Statesmen Quartet, started by the Baptist minister in 1948,
has been cited as Presley's favorite gospel group and a major
influence on him.
   Flamboyant by gospel standards, Lister and his Statesmen were
regulars at all-night gospel sings all over the Southeast and on
Atlanta radio and television.

   Spike Lee says the strides made during
the civil rights movement are being eroded and that it's his job as
a filmmaker to portray ``the present state of racism today.''
   Lee, who addressed more than 1,200 people at the University of
Iowa on Tuesday, said racial violence in the Howard Beach section
of New York City compelled him to make his 1989 film ``Do The Right
Thing,'' about racial tension and violence during a hot city summer.
   ``In a lot of ways this country is going backward instead of
forward, especially with all the whole ... affirmative action and
all that stuff that people were dying for in the civil rights
movement,'' the black filmmaker said.
   ``I wanted to film about the present state of racism today. I
knew I don't have the answers, but that wasn't my job,'' Lee said.
``What my job was to hold the mirror up and let people know that
this is the way it is and unless we all make an effort to do
something about it, it's going to get worse.''

   It's out of the recording studios and
into the docket for the rock group Boston, whose leader is the
defendant in a $20 million breach-of-contract lawsuit by CBS
records.
   In opening arguments Tuesday, Don Engel, an attorney for band
leader Tom Scholz, said the company bullied his client, illegally
suspended his royalties and could not, or would not, understand
Scholz's artistic difficulties.
   CBS charged that Scholz refused to produce albums ``not because
he couldn't do his job, but because he wouldn't do his job.''
   The $20 million lawsuit, originally filed in 1983 against the
entire band, charged the band with failing to deliver the number of
albums agreed to under their 1976, $5 million contract with CBS.
Allegations against other band members were thrown out.
   The heart of the suit is a dispute over royalties that led
Boston to switch from CBS to MCA Records, which is also named in
the suit. The group's first two albums, ``Boston'' and ``Don't Look
Back,'' were platinum sellers for CBS.

School students loved the show all the same.
   Particularly when the five Russian rockers, on a 2{-month tour,
talked about the bad old days when they honed heavy metal in their
homeland while dodging flying lead.
   ``Officials never liked what we were doing, our music, our hair,
the guitar music,'' said Alexie Belov, lead singer of Gorky Park,
which headlined last summer's Moscow Peace Festival with U.S. bands
such as Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. ``Finally they said ... you
cannot play anymore.''
   It didn't stop them.
   ``We had to play really wild underground clubs with bullet holes
in the walls and sometimes the customers would come in and shoot,''
Belov said Tuesday.

<MEMO>  Theater  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     My reaction is much the same, too. This is a nice way to spend an evening.;
   A hero forever;  Sammy Cahn is one of my heroes. Anybody can worship Joe
Montana or Mel Gibson. Those icons will have their moment in the sun and
disappear, albeit with smiles. Sammy Cahn and the songs he wrote are forever,
and it's the public that keeps the smiles.;    Cahn jests a lot about his life
as a lyricist and wins laughs by pretending that writing words to music is
something of a lark. In one or two examples -- the Academy Award-winning hit
"Three Coins in the Fountain," for example -- he may have a point.;    But
Cahn wrote a whole catalog of lyrics that hang onto their wit and our hearts.
Here are a few: "Until the Real Thing Comes Along," "Love Is Lovelier the
Second Time Around," "A Pocketful of Miracles," "Love and Marriage," "All the
Way," "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow," "A Touch of Class," "Saturday
Night Is the Loneliest Night of the Week," "(Kiss Me Once and Kiss Me Twice
and Kiss Me Once Again) It's Been a Long, Long Time.";    You want more? "High
Hopes," "Call Me Irresponsible," "The Tender Trap," "It Seems I've Heard That
Song Before.";    I've heard them all before, and, while Cahn's jests could
use a freshen-up, I'm never going to weary of the songs. Nor of the way he
sings them. The 78-year-old tummler (a make-happy guy at the Jewish resorts)
has just a wisp of a voice, but nobody sells a song better than a songwriter,
not when they've spent a lifetime at it.;    Cahn talks about his composer
collaborators -- people such as Saul Chaplin, Jimmy Van Heusen and Jule Styne.
He explains a lyric or two, including the line, "My heart will lose its mind"
from "Five Minutes More" that once mystified a film producer. He eulogizes the
De Castro Sisters for saving "Teach Me Tonight" from the ash can, tells jokes
about a stiff Doris Day and the operatic Mario Lanza.;    "I won't say I made
Frank Sinatra," Cahn grins, "but judge for yourself." And he belts -- OK,
pushes -- a handful of hits that, indeed, made Sinatra, including the best
city song ever written -- "My Kind of Town, Chicago Is." Where would Frankie
be without "All the Way"? Then again, Cahn made a few shekels on the deal,
too.;    Cahn dances through "Thoroughly Modern Millie," with its intricate
rhymes. "It won two gold medals and financed my second marriage.";    He tells
us that "Bei Mir Bist Du Shoen" is his favorite song because, finally, his
(Yiddish-speaking) mama could understand what her Sammy did for a living. But
Cahn, strangely, leaves out the name of the songwriters who created that song
in its Yiddish form, including the title, which Cahn adapted and the Andrew
Sisters immortalized. That was composer Sholem Secunda. Jacob Jacobs wrote the
Yiddish lyric.;    By the way, Cahn used to say that "Call Me Irresponsible"
was his favorite song. I won't hold him to it.;    Cahn appears not to be
getting any older. He still moves pretty well for a skinny, bald
septuagenarian, and, by the way, when he went through the audience shaking
hands and making jokes, he kidded a bald head that may have been sitting on my
shoulders. For shame.;    Cahn also kids himself, singing parody lyrics: "This
is my first affair/ So what goes where?" And Cahn tells us, "I never had to be
inspired to write. Just paid.";    Strong help; Cahn is ably abetted by a trio
of performers: Jordan Bennett, a big-voiced tenor; Linda Lloyd, a steamy
belter, whose "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" stops the show; and Shawn
Daywalt, a somewhat priggish soprano who sings better than she moves. You may
remember Bennett as Che in "Evita" for the San Jose Civic Light Opera. Harper
MacKay, on the piano again, has his usual droll fun.;    Cahn tells us that if
he had been born 13 years earlier, he might have been George Burns. I detected
a note of envy.;    I, on the other hand, am jealous of Cahn. I gave up
lyric-writing for journalism, never suspecting that clips get yellow, while
songs go on forever. As does Sammy Cahn. This man wrote "Time After Time."

OSCAR-WINNING SONGWRITER SAMMY FAIN DIES AT AGE 87
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sammy Fain, among the last of that select breed of tunesmiths who peddled their
songs from the backs of trucks and in the dingy hallways of New York City's
legendary Tin Pan Alley, died Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-time Academy Award-winning songwriter (for "Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing" and "Secret Love") was 87 when he died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
Prolific and pleasant, Fain kept at his piano until shortly before his death,
adding to a library of song that brought him admission to the Songwriters Hall
of Fame in 1971. His dozens of tunes, many of them for films, included such
evergreen melodies as "I'll Be Seeing You," "Katie," "Let a Smile Be Your
Umbrella," "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine," "I Can Dream,
Can't I?," "Dear Hearts and Gentle People," "You Brought a New Kind of Love to
Me" and "When I Take My Sugar to Tea."
</P>
<P>
Films he scored or wrote for include "Footlight Parade," "Hellzapoppin," "I'll
Be Seeing You," "Anchors Aweigh," "Alice in Wonderland," "Calamity Jane," "Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing," "A Certain Smile," "Tender Is the Night," "Myra
Breckinridge," "The Rescuers" and others.
</P>
<P>
In all, he was nominated for nine Oscars.
</P>
<P>
He also collaborated on four Broadway musicals in the 1950s and 1960s,
including "Flahooley," "Ankles Aweigh" (revived in 1988), "Christine" and
"Something More."
</P>
<P>
Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City, he attended school there and taught
himself the piano and composition as a youth.
</P>
<P>
Fain became part of a unique group of early 20th-Century American songwriters
such as Irving Berlin who were gifted with an abundant talent for simple
melodies that remained popular decades after the tunes first were heard.
</P>
<P>
While his success wasn't instantaneous (he worked for several Tin Pan Alley
song publishers before establishing an independent reputation), it proved
lasting.
</P>
<P>
His collaboration with lyricist Irving Kahal produced the first of his hits,
"Nobody Knows What a Redheaded Momma Can Do."
</P>
<P>
With Kahal he also wrote "Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella," "Wedding Bells Are
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine" and "When I Take My Sugar to Tea," all
immensely popular hits.
</P>
<P>
His other lyricists over the years included Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster,
Sammy Cahn, E. Y. Harburg and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
</P>
<P>
Fain came to Hollywood as one of the country's rising young composers in the
early days of sound films when producers were grinding out musicals with
abandon.
</P>
<P>
His first recorded film credit was "It's a Great Life" in 1929 and his last was
"The Rescuers" in 1977.
</P>
<P>
He wrote songs for Dick Powell ("By a Waterfall"), Mae West ("Now I'm a Lady")
and Maurice Chevalier ("You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me.")
</P>
<P>
He and Kahal were reunited on Broadway in 1938 for a long-forgotten flop called
"Right This Way" but the score contained two of Fain's greatest songs, "I'll Be
Seeing You" and "I Can Dream, Can't I?"
</P>
<P>
"I'll Be Seeing You" was used as a signature song by the cabaret singer
Hildegarde throughout her career while "I Can Dream, Can't I?" was a wartime
hit for the Andrews Sisters.
</P>
<P>
In the last several years Fain could be seen about Los Angeles playing for
former radio or film stars or fellow songwriters at their various meetings.
</P>
<P>
Frail but enthusiastic, he dressed in the latest styles and would offer up his
long-ago melodies in a reedy, infectious voice and always with a smile.
</P>
<P>
His awards included several from foreign governments, including Italy and
France.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year he was presented a special award from the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers for being "one of America's premier composers
of popular songs."
</P>
<P>
Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator with Fain on "Peter Pan"
and its enduring song "You Can Fly, You Can Fly, You Can Fly," said his old
friend leaves "not just a few but a staggering medley of hits, songs that are
readily identifiable to everyone."
</P>
<P>
And then he added, "You know, old songwriters never really die because their
songs keep them alive forever."
</P>
<P>
Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York City. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Cindy Walker Writes `Songs With A Face'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cindy Walker, ``the queen of country
music songwriters,'' has spent about half a century writing
recognizable songs that have been recorded by such performers as
Elvis Presley and Bing Crosby.
   The veteran composer, who lives in Mexia, Texas, has written more
than 450 songs that have been recorded. She was a finalist this year
for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   The best tunes, she said in a telephone interview, ``are songs
with a face.''
   ``You recognize them. You know them. It's like a person. They
have a face that's outstanding. Other songs don't have a face; you
just hear them, that's all. The really good ones are few and far
between.''
   Two of her best known songs are ``You Don't Know Me'' and ``Dream
Baby.''
   ``You Don't Know Me'' has been recorded by more than 75 singers,
including Presley, Ray Charles, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Vale and Mickey
Gilley. Walker wrote the song in the mid-1950s after Arnold
suggested the title, although he had no music or lyrics to go with
it.
   ``I was in Nashville for a music convention and he said, `I've
got a title for you.' He said you've got to promise me to write it.
I was flippant about it (the title) because it didn't strike me at
the time,'' she said.
   ``It's about someone you think you know but you don't. I came on
home and two months later, I was sitting in my chair in my studio
and that song just started singing itself. I was just carried away
with it.
   ``It took me three weeks to finish. Then I called Eddy and sang
it over the phone to him. He had forgotten about it, but he recorded
it three weeks later.''
   Her song ``Dream Baby'' was written in the mid 1960s and was a
hit by Roy Orbison and later Glen Campbell among others.
   ``It's been recorded by lots of people,'' she said. ``I hate to
name names because I leave someone out.''
   Some of her other songs include ``In the Misty Moonlight,''
``Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me,'' ``China Doll'' and tunes with
a Western flavor such as ``Blue Canadian Rockies,'' ``My Rancho Rio
Grande,'' ``Lone Star Trail'' and ``You're From Texas.''
   For the king of Western swing music, Bob Wills, she wrote
``Bubbles in My Beer,'' ``Cherokee Maiden'' and ``Dusty Skies.''
   Her first big break, though, came in 1942 when she accompanied
her father, a cotton buyer, on a trip to Hollywood. They drove past
the Crosby Building and she decided to try to make an appointment
with Bing Crosby.
   ``I went into the office and asked for Mr. Crosby,'' she
recalled. ``The secretary said Larry or which one. I didn't know
there was but one. So I asked for the first one said named. It was
Larry. He listened and I sang him the song. He said Bing had been
looking for a Western song. He said, `meet me here tomorrow and
we'll let him hear it.' I did.''
   As a result, ``Lone Star Trail'' was recorded by Bing Crosby and
became her first song recorded by someone else.
   ``It started me off,'' she said.
   Later, she signed her own recording contract with Decca Records.
For five years she was a performer and songwriter and appeared in a
few movies but eventually decided to concentrate on composing.
   ``I've always been a songwriter,'' she said. ``Everything was an
offshoot from my writing.''
   Her procedure has been to think of a title and then go from there.
   ``The title tells the story. If you can get a real good title,
you've got something. I always write from the title. I've never
written a song without the title.''
   Melodies flow from the lyrics, she said.
   ``The words and music come together. It just sort of comes to
you. The songs just sing themselves to me. They kind of write
themselves. I just stand back and listen.''
   Walker, who gives her age as ``old enough to know better and
young enough not to care,'' is still writing. Her song, ``Sugar
Moon,'' has recently been recorded by country stars Willie Nelson,
Janie Frickie and K.D. Lang.
   ``I write all the time. It's all I've ever done,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Whitey Shafer Writes About Marriage</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lyndia cq 7th graf.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three failed marriages helped country
music songwriter Sanger D. ``Whitey'' Shafer to compose the
memorable ``All My Ex's Live in Texas.''
   In fact, he wrote the amusing ditty _ recorded by George Strait
_ with his fourth wife's assistance. The 1987 song is probably
Shafer's best known work in a 25-year composing career that's
yielded 200 recorded tunes.
   ``I think I've written something about everything that's ever
been written about,'' the 55-year-old Shafer said recently.
   His wry look at former spouses, embellished by the catchy title,
became one of the most popular country songs of the past decade.
Local country music bands everywhere have the song in their
repertoire.
   The tune also helped Strait win the prestigious ``Entertainer of
the Year'' award from the Country Music Association last year.
   And attention all those ex's: the royalties helped Shafer, too.
   He and current wife, Lyndia, who have been married eight years,
wrote the song about his three ex-wives. It's not malicious, and
listeners tend to feel sorry for the fellow in the song who can't
even return to the river where he learned how to swim.
   ``That's why I hang my hat in Tennessee,'' the song says.
   ``He'd like to go to Texas, but things are kinda hot down
there,'' explained Shafer, born and raised in the Waco, Texas,
area. ``It was a fun song to write. I did change the names to
protect the guilty.''
   The rhyming title, which has become one of the most famous in
country music, is a followup to a punchy line he wrote in the 1970s
for another song: ``I was following the rodeos in Texas and being
chased by the fathers of my ex's.''
   ``Some titles don't tell the whole story, but this one did,''
said Shafer, who got the nickname ``Whitey'' in high school because
of his light-colored hair.
   He gives Strait, a fellow Texan, credit for taking a chance on
the song others considered inappropriate.
   ``I think if he had not have cut that, it would never have been
recorded,'' Shafer said. ``People are funny about cutting cute
songs, but that one just had something about it. It was too cute to
pass up.
   ``I wish I had a bushel basket full like that one.''
   The inevitable question is whether his three ex-wives really do
live in Texas and how they reacted to the song. ``They do live
there, but one sort of drifts back and forth between California and
Texas,'' Shafer said.
   He's not sure how two of them feel, but ex-wife Darlene took it
fine.
   ``We're still friends,'' he said.
   Last year, Shafer wrote the hit song ``I Wonder Do You Think of
Me,'' which was the first tune released by country singer Keith
Whitley after Whitley died in May of an accidental overdose of
alcohol. It was a No. 1 record.
   ``I liked him a whole lot and he'd been to my house a lot when
he first came to town,'' Shafer said. ``He was a heck of a talent,
a great singer and was only getting better as he went on. He also
had a great personality.''
   Some of Shafer's other top songs include ``Does Fort Worth Ever
Cross Your Mind,'' recorded by Strait; ``That's the Way Love
Goes,'' a No. 1 country music record by both Merle Haggard and
Johnny Rodriguez; and ``I Never Go Around Mirrors,'' also recorded
by Whitley.
   Shafer moved to Nashville from Texas in the mid-1960s with the
idea of becoming a singer. He did some performing, but found the
competition stiff.
   ``There were too many singers,'' he recalled. So he turned to
songwriting.
   ``For some reason, I've always been able to retain a string of
notes I've heard,'' he said. ``It just seems like I know what kind
of idea will go with a certain melody.''
   Shafer, who recently was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters
Hall of Fame, describes himself as a writer of traditional country
music with little interest in pop oriented styles. Give him a few
beers and his favorite instrument and he'll come up with a country
song.
   ``It just seemed like a guitar and six pack went together,'' he
said.
   ``Right now I like to write love songs because I'm in love. When
I was rough and rowdy, I wrote rough and rowdy songs.''
   But he says country music's honky-tonk songs glorifying alcohol,
such as Hank Williams' ``There's a Tear in My Beer,'' aren't as
popular as they used to be.
   ``Drinking and getting drunk is not hip any more. People don't
like to see it. It's almost indignant to be tipsy. People just
don't want to mess with people who can't control their lives.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Simon Sense of Achievement</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carly Simon has been working hard these days,
doing everything from singing standards dressed in glamorous gowns
to writing songs to recording two albums, scoring a film and
writing children's books.
   She has a sense of achievement. And she's looking forward to
summer like a kid let out of school.
   Her newest album, ``My Romance,'' has 11 standards, plus a new
song co-written by Simon, ``What Has She Got?'' Arista Records
intends to release it with a record of her own songs that will come
out next fall.
   Some of those, written around her birthday, will be about the
passing of time. It will include ``Fisherman's Song,'' which sounds
like a folk song and has Judy Collins and Lucy Simon singing
backup, and ``Have You Seen Me Lately?'' _ a tune Simon wrote for
Meryl Streep to sing in Mike Nichols' upcoming film ``Postcards
From the Edge.''
   Simon did a Home Box Office special in April, with Harry Connick
Jr. as her guest. He played piano on some songs, and performed some
duets.
   ``We only went through them once and it sounds as if we've been
singing together our whole lives,'' Simon said. ``It was magical.
He's one of the most talented people I've ever met. He sings like
(Frank) Sinatra and plays piano like (Thelonius) Monk.''
   On May 6 she sang a few songs with Connick in his show at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   Simon recently watched a video of the one-hour special for the
first time because she had been afraid to watch it. She thought
their duet, ``I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do,'' was ``very
sexy.''
   But she was winging it with her on-stage patter. ``I hate
hearing myself; I feel embarrassed. They left them in; they felt it
lends a sort of down-to-earth quality.''
   For the album, she and pianist Michael Kosarin went through
``piles and piles of songs deciding which were best for my voice,''
winding up with six by Richard Rodgers. Then Marty Paich arranged
for orchestra and conducted.
   ``I can't imagine anybody treating those songs more sensitively
and romantically,'' Simon said. The record was made in three days,
four songs a day.
   She spent one week before the HBO special was shown in scoring
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   ``Fortunately, I was able to mobilize everything in my head and
work with a sense of urgency, panic and drama. It was very much
like studying for the exam when you haven't done the work all
semester.
   ``I think I wrote a great song for Meryl to sing opening the
picture. She sings two other songs, `You Don't Know Me,' the old
Ray Charles song, and one Shel Silverstein wrote.''
   The same week she and Doubleday editor Jacqueline Onassis
finished work on her children's book for next Christmas, ``The Boy
of the Bells.'' Her first children's book was ``Amy the Dancing
Bear,'' out for Christmas 1989. ``I'm going to put out one a year
probably for the rest of my life.''
   Her husband, Jim Hart, who can be seen in the audience at the
special, is finishing a novel.
   Sipping a big mug of tea during an interview, Simon talked about
Jackie O.
   ``She had great suggestions; she helped me enormously,'' she
said. ``The thing I love about her is that she didn't want to
`tighten it up' or take any of my personality out of it. The other
thing I feel is that her work thrills her. She doesn't do it dryly
or coldly. She is perfect for an artistic type of person. If I feel
like I'm just taking up somebody's time, I just feel awful.
   ``She didn't do this editing on `Amy.' That landed on her desk
almost perfect. I must have told that 1,000 times to Sarah and Ben.
This I started from scratch on a day in the sun when I felt like
thinking up a new story. It wasn't honed the way `Amy' was.''
   When her children Sarah, called Sally, 15, and Ben, 13, were
young, Simon made up stories for them.
   ``I loved doing it. I very rarely read to them because they
seemed to go to sleep better if all the lights were out,'' she said.
   ``Amy is a budding aritst. That was a story that Sally
particularly loved. Ben was quite angry that I didn't dedicate it
to him as well.'' She dedicated ``The Boy of the Bells,'' a
Christmas story, to him.
   The reason she wrote down Amy and some of her other bedtime
stories wasn't to publish but so she wouldn't forget them. ``I knew
when I had grandchidren the kids would say, `Remember the one you
used to tell about Amy.' My memory would be completely gone by that
time.''
   In her musical future, Simon wants to sing both her own songs
and standards. She wrote ``Fisherman's Song'' in 20 minutes after
coming home late from recording and finding Ben asleep. ``I smelled
his neck and kissed his eyelids, things he doesn't let me do
because he's 13. I translated that to an unrequited love situation.
A girl sneaks into a loved one's house and lies beside him. It
sounds like an old English folk song. It shows another style of
mine I feel equally at home in.''
   Simon made one previous album of standards, ``Torch,'' in 1981.
``Everybody gives Linda Ronstadt credit for having gone back and
done the standards. I always felt jealous she got all the credit
for it.''

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning songwriter Jimmy Van
Heusen, who wrote such tunes as ``All the Way,'' ``Love and
Marriage'' and ``High Hopes,'' was remembered upon his death as one
of pop music's most important composers.
   Van Heusen died of a stroke Tuesday night at his desert home
east of Los Angeles, according to a spokesman at the Riverside
County Coroner's Office. He was 77.
   Van Heusen collaborated with such lyricists as Johnny Mercer,
Johnny Burke, Eddie DeLange and most notably, Sammy Cahn. He also
wrote for Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra.
   ``Jimmy Van Heusen was an architect of melody,'' Cahn said
Wednesday. ``When we were writing together, if I would ask him to
add even a grace note to the song, he would sit down and write a
whole new melody.''
   Van Heusen won Academy Awards with Cahn for ``All the Way'' in
1957; ``High Hopes'' in 1959; and ``Call Me Irresponsible'' in
1963. ``High Hopes'' was chosen as the official song for John F.
Kennedy's presidential campaign.
   He and Johnny Burke also won an Oscar for ``Swingin' on a Star''
in 1944.
   ``He was one of the most important composers of American pop
music,'' Cahn said. ``He was considered a composer's composer.''
   The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, Van
Heusen was born Edward Chester Babcock on Jan. 26, 1913, in
Syracuse, N.Y. He adopted the name Van Heusen from the shirt
maker's billboard advertisement.
   In 1928, he was expelled from Central High School in Syracuse
for singing his own composition, entitled, ``My Canary Has Circles
Under Its Eyes.''
   His next-door neighbor in Syracuse was composer Harold Arlen.
When Arlen went to Hollywood in 1933, he asked his brother Jerry
Arlen and Van Heusen to take over his writing duties at New York
City's Cotton Club in Harlem.
   He wrote ``Harlem Hospitality.'' The tune and the show for it
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight
elevator and plugging tunes until he got a hit when Crosby recorded
``It's the Dreamer in Me'' in 1938.
   By 1940, he was one of Tin Pan Alley's most successful
composers, with 60 songs published in just one season. Hollywood
beckoned, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that
became known as the Gold Dust Twins. Among the words and music they
churned out were the daffy tunes for the Bob Hope and Crosby
``Road'' pictures.
   He wrote ``Swingin' on a Star,'' for Crosby's movie ``Going My
Way.'' The tune ``Love and Marriage'' won a 1955 Emmy and has been
introduced to a new generation of television viewers as the theme
song for ``Married ... With Children.''
   During the summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army
camps with Crosby, sometimes serving as Crosby's pilot.
   In 1955, Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of
motion picture scores that became hits. They also scored the 1965
Broadway musical, ``Skyscraper,'' including ``Everybody has a Right
to Be Wrong.''
   Cahn and Van Heusen also wrote numerous hit songs for Sinatra,
including ``All the Way,'' and the title songs of the albums ``Come
Fly With Me,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Come Dance With Me'' and
``September of My Years.''
   Van Heusen was one of 10 songwriters elected to the Songwriters
Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1971.
   The gregarious Van Heusen loved entertaining, parties, and the
single life. ``I dig chicks, booze, music and Sinatra _ in that
order,'' he told an interviewer in the 1960s.
   Cahn called Van Heusen ``one of the world's greatest swingers.''
   Van Heusen remained a bachelor until September 1969, when he
married Bobbe Brock. He is survived by his wife.
   Private services are scheduled Friday at Desert Memorial Park in
Cathedral City.

JIMMY VAN HEUSEN, PROLIFIC SONGSMITH, OSCAR WINNER, DIES
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Van Heusen, who took his name from a shirt label and his melodies from a
mirthful mind and gentle heart, has died at his home in Rancho Mirage.
</P>
<P>
The tunesmith whose "Swinging on a Star," "All the Way," "High Hopes" and "Call
Me Irresponsible" not only won four Oscars but became national monuments, had
celebrated his 77th birthday last month.
</P>
<P>
He died Tuesday, a spokesman for the Riverside County coroner's office said
Wednesday. His death was attributed to a stroke, and the coroner's spokesman
said he had suffered from cerebral vascular disease for about two years.
</P>
<P>
Born Edward Chester Babcock in Syracuse, N.Y., he was a mischievous boy who was
expelled from high school for singing a mildly salacious song "My Canary Has
Rings Under His Eyes" at a school assembly.
</P>
<P>
It probably was the only song he was ever identified with that he didn't
compose himself.
</P>
<P>
He grew to become a fun-loving adult who once told an interviewer "I dig
chicks, booze, music and Sinatra -- in that order."
</P>
<P>
It was Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby who made famous his songs -- "Aren't You
Glad You're You" from Crosby's film "The Bells of St. Mary's"; "Moonlight
Becomes You" from Crosby's "The Road to Morocco"; "(Love Is) The Tender Trap,"
from Sinatra's "The Tender Trap" and "All the Way" from Sinatra's "The Joker Is
Wild."
</P>
<P>
He was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards for such musical
masterpieces as "The Second Time Around" from "High Time"; "Pocketful of
Miracles" from the 1961 film of the same name; "My Kind of Town," a Sinatra
signature song from "Robin and the 7 Hoods" and more.
</P>
<P>
He won an Emmy for "Love and Marriage" from the 1955 production of "Our Town."
It since has become a leitmotif for the current generation of TV watchers who
now hear it as the theme of the ribald "Married . . . With Children."
</P>
<P>
If he helped make stars of Crosby (both as a priest and with Bob Hope in the
legendary "Road" series of comedies) and Sinatra, he also helped make household
words and friends of his many collaborators -- Johnny Mercer, Johnny Burke,
Eddie DeLange and most notably and recently, Sammy Cahn.
</P>
<P>
The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, young Edward Babcock
was encouraged to seek a conventional education, even though he was more
interested in music.
</P>
<P>
After leaving high school under circumstances his parents didn't consider
amusing, he enrolled briefly at a boarding school near Syracuse but left there
when teachers found him more often in poolrooms than classrooms.
</P>
<P>
While still a student, Babcock (who never changed his name legally) landed a
job on a local radio station for $15 a week. The station manager insisted that
he change his name, and he appropriated Van Heusen from the shirt manufacturer
and James because he said he just liked it.
</P>
<P>
He did attend Syracuse University from 1930 to 1932, studying piano and
composition, and while there formed a partnership with Jerry Arlen, Harold
Arlen's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
His next-door neighbor in Syracuse had been composer Arlen, and when the man
who was to write the music for "The Wizard of Oz" went to Hollywood in 1933, he
asked his brother and Van Heusen to take over his composing duties at Harlem's
famed Cotton Club.
</P>
<P>
Van Heusen wrote "Harlem Hospitality." The tune and the show it was written for
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight elevator at
Park Central Hotel and plugging tunes.
</P>
<P>
One of his first compositions, "There's a House in Harlem for Sale" was
performed by the hotel orchestra and got him out of the elevator and into a job
with a music publishing firm.
</P>
<P>
He met orchestra leader Jimmy Dorsey in 1938 and offered him his latest song,
"It's the Dreamer in Me." The resultant recording became a hit and also sold
100,000 copies of sheet music.
</P>
<P>
Crosby also recorded it and, by 1940, Van Heusen had become one of Tin Pan
Alley's most successful composers, with 60 songs published in just one season.
Next came Hollywood, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that
became known as the Gold Dust Twins.
</P>
<P>
He composed his first film score with Burke for "Love Thy Neighbor" in 1940,
which was widely recorded.
</P>
<P>
In a single week that year, Van Heusen had three songs on the Hit Parade,
including "Shake Down the Stars," "All This and Heaven Too" and "Polka Dots and
Moonbeams."
</P>
<P>
During the wartime summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army camps with
Crosby, sometimes serving as the crooner's pilot. He had amassed enough flying
time to qualify as a test pilot for Lockheed Corp., taking war planes up for
their maiden voyages between 1942 and 1944.
</P>
<P>
He owned aircraft and a helicopter during the 1960s, and his Yucca Valley ranch
was equipped with a landing pad.
</P>
<P>
At one point Van Heusen and Burke were under contract to Crosby, 20th Century
Fox, MGM, Columbia and International studios.
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of motion picture
scores that became hits. Their Academy Award-winning "High Hopes" was chosen as
the official song for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The composer also donated the song "California" to the inaugural gala held for
former California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.
</P>
<P>
Although he had tremendous success with popular tunes (seven Grammy
nominations) and movie music, Broadway was one venue whose success eluded Van
Heusen. The productions of "Swingin' the Dream," "Nellie Bly" and "Carnival in
Flanders" were all acknowledged by the composer as flops.
</P>
<P>
(The durable jazz ballad "Darn That Dream" was one of the few bright spots from
the 1939 "Swingin' the Dream," which starred Louis Armstrong and Benny
Goodman.)
</P>
<P>
"It's a big, big gamble," he said in 1965 before the stage production of
"Skyscraper," for which he was nominated for a Tony award. "You spend two years
putting it together, and if six critics don't like it, you're out of business
overnight. It's that simple."
</P>
<P>
He had shaved his head for years and cut a dashing figure with exquisite but
casual clothes. He loved entertaining, parties, and, until 1969 when he married
singer Bobbe Brock, being single. Friends said he was able to write songs with
a party going on around him or while lounging by his swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
He also wrote songs for those same friends, including two for Sinatra's
daughters -- "Nancy (With the Laughing Face)" and "Tina."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, lyricist Cahn said by telephone from New York that when people
ask him who is the most fascinating character he ever met, he always answers
"Jimmy Van Heusen."
</P>
<P>
"Then they say, 'what about Sinatra?'
</P>
<P>
"I tell them Sinatra thought he was Van Heusen, but he couldn't pass the
physical."

<HEAD>The Sweetest Sounds of Richard Rodgers</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If any phrase could sum up the career of Richard
Rodgers, it is a lyric from ``No Strings,'' the only musical for
which he wrote both words and music.
   ``The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear are still inside my head,''
sing its lead characters, played originally on Broadway by Diahann
Carroll and Richard Kiley. That search for the perfect melody
echoed throughout Rodgers' career of more than 60 years in the
American musical theater, years that were divided into three
distinctive parts.
   The composer's career _ first with Lorenz Hart, then with Oscar
Hammerstein II and finally with a variety of younger lyricists _ is
celebrated in ``Music by Richard Rodgers,'' to be shown Friday,
March 16, on PBS' ``Great Performances.''
   The show, narrated by Shirley Jones, is studded with film clips
from many Rodgers shows _ as different as ``The Garrick Gaities,''
``Pal Joey'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   And there is an appreciation of Rodgers, who died in 1979, by
other composers including Andrew Lloyd Webber, Burton Lane, Jerry
Herman and Charles Strouse, as well as remembrances by his widow,
Dorothy Rodgers.
   ``He really was a theater writer,'' she said the other day in an
interview at her Fifth Avenue apartment. ``Unlike some other great
writers _ Irving Berlin, for instance, who was the greatest
songwriter who ever lived _ Dick wrote only for the theater or film
or television.''
   Rodgers gave the impression of being a fast writer, able to dash
off music quickly. That wasn't so, Mrs. Rodgers insists. Before he
began composing he would carefully consider what he wanted to
express _ the emotion he was trying to convey and what he wanted to
say to advance the plot. He also considered practical matters, such
as the musical ability of his stars.
   ``Just before he died, he wrote `I Remember Mama,' for Liv
Ullmann who had a range of very few notes,'' Mrs. Rodgers said.
``It was quite a difficult thing to do, but he accepted all such
challenges.''
   Rodgers always looked for something new to do.
   ``He felt the greatest way to insure failure was to repeat
yourself,'' Mrs. Rodgers said.
   His quest for innovation led to four of his best musicals with
Hart, written after an unsatisfying sojourn to Hollywood in the
early 1930s. These landmarks were ``On Your Toes,'' 1936, with its
use of extended ballet sequences created by George Balanchine;
``Babes in Arms,'' 1937, which starred one of the youngest group of
performers ever to appear on Broadway; ``The Boys From Syracuse,''
1938, one of the most successful musical adaptations of a
Shakespeare comedy, and ``Pal Joey,'' 1940, a sophisticated,
sardonic show with Gene Kelly as its charming anti-hero.
   Rodgers always wrote at home. He didn't have an office until
after ``Carousel'' in 1945 when he and Hammerstein started to
produce shows themselves.
   ``Larry Hart and Oscar Hammerstein worked in totally different
ways,'' Mrs. Rodgers recalled. ``Larry could not be forced to put a
word on paper until he heard the tune. But Oscar wanted the freedom
to write the lyric first. Dick didn't care. He could work either
way.
   ``Sometimes he would close open doors because he preferred not
to feel that people were listening until he finished writing. We
all entered into a conspiracy of pretending that we couldn't hear
him until he was done. And he went along with that. He allowed
himself to be fooled.''
   If there was any question about a tune, Rodgers simply threw it
away and wrote another one, Mrs. Rodgers said, although Hart and
Hammerstein mostly used what their partner wrote.
   ``Once in a while, my daughters and I wouldn't let him forget
something we were crazy about that got lost in the tryout period,''
she said. ``One example is `Getting to Know You' which was called
`Suddenly Lucky' when it was in `South Pacific' and then dropped.
`There's a Small Hotel' was written for `Jumbo' and producer Billy
Rose didn't like it, so it was taken out. Later Dick used it in `On
Your Toes.' But it was rare that he used a song again. He felt that
he could always do better writing a new song for a new situation.''
   The Rodgers and Hart partnership ended in 1943 with Hart's death
at the age of 48 of acute pneumonia complicated by alcoholism.
   ``Larry was brilliant but he was basically a very unhappy man,''
Mrs. Rodgers said. ``And if you read his lyrics, that sadness is
there.''
   Even before Hart's death, Rodgers had begun work on a new
project _ which Hart turned down _ to adapt ``Green Grow the
Lilacs'' into a musical play. His partner was Hammerstein and the
show became ``Oklahoma!''
   ``Oscar was a very methodical man. If he said he would finish
the lyric in a week, it would be finished in a week,'' Mrs. Rodgers
said. ``Once Dick and Oscar decided on the musical they would do,
they spent endless hours discussing every aspect of what kind of
show it would be.''
   After ``Oklahoma!'' the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership
lasted 17 years, and out of it came such classics as ``Carousel,''
``The King and I'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   Hammerstein died in 1960 of cancer, and Rodgers plunged on alone
with ``No Strings.'' Besides writing both music and lyrics, he did
several interesting things with the show. He put the orchestra on
stage with the actors and took the show's title literally. There
were no stringed instruments in the show.
   Even though Rodgers' last shows, ``Two by Two,'' ``Rex'' and ``I
Remember Mama,'' were unsuccessful they contained soaring melodies.
Such songs as ``I Do Not Know a Day I Did Not Love You,'' ``Away
From You'' and ``You Could Not Please Me More'' are among his most
haunting.
   But even the master had self-doubts about his work.
   ``Oh, yes,'' his wife said. ``at least until he began to work on
the next show. Once he got the first song out, which he called the
first olive out of the jar, then he relaxed and felt confident.''

<HEAD>Geto Boys Decision Raises Questions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents of 5th, 16th grafs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The latest lyrical blow-up in the summer of 2
Live Crew involves the Geto Boys, a Houston-based rap group whose
talk of murder, rape, robbery and dismemberment scared Geffen
Records off handling their record.
   Geffen's decision this month again raised questions of
censorship and racism in the record industry. But the label says
it's simply a business decision based on lyrics that glamorized
``violence, racism and misogyny.''
   Not so, says the band, accusing the record company of a double
standard when it comes to standards. Some in the industry suggest
the double standard is based on skin color, not song content. And
women's rights groups remain appalled by the group's insensitive
rhymes.
   ``Imagine a mix of N.W.A.'s violent imagery and 2 Live Crew's
sexual nasties,'' the L.A. Times' Steve Hochman wrote of the Geto
Boys. Rappers N.W.A. had their own lyric problems last year, when
police officers nationwide were riled by a song urging violence
against law enforcement.
   The Geto Boys are just as graphic about violence. A sample
lyric: ``Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape. Shouldn't have
had her curtains open, so that's her fate.''
   ``As a business decision, it's probably crazy. This record, with
the publicity, is no doubt going to sell a lot of copies. We're
talking tonnage,'' Bryn Bridenthal, Geffen vice president of media
and artist relations, said about the LP, ``The Geto Boys.''
   ``I was flabbergasted that people would describe violence that
graphically in music. People will think this is like 2 Live Crew,
which is kind of silly, just pure sex,'' she continued. ``I was
frightened by this.''
   Yet Geffen is the label for heavy metal Guns 'N Roses, which was
accused of racism and homophobia in its lyrics, and it distributes
the infamous Andrew Dice Clay, whose scatological, sexist shows
created a furor earlier this year. Clay, like the Geto Boys, is
signed to Def American.
   ``This is the same label which backed Dice and Guns 'N Roses
without any hesitation, even when there was a big flap. You have to
wonder if this inconsistency borders on racism,'' veteran rap
publicist Bill Adler said last week.
   Debbie Bennett, director of public relations for the 2 Live
Crew's Luke Records, was more direct: ``It's easier to single out a
black group on a small label than any white group. Right now, it
seems like the racist, easy thing to pick on.''
   The controversy is the latest round in the record
labeling-censorship battle. The 2 Live Crew remain under fire for
their ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' album, which was ripped for its
graphic sexual content and its denigration of women.
   In Louisiana, a bill requiring labeling for recordings with
potentially offensive lyrics passed the Legislature but was vetoed.
   Artists are striking back. Bruce Springsteen allowed 2 Live Crew
to sample his ``Born in the U.S.A.'' for the group's rap response
to its critics, ``Banned in the U.S.A.'' Neil Young included a song
with an obscenity on his upcoming LP to insure it gets a parental
advisory sticker.
   As for the Geto Boys themselves, lead rapper Bushwick Bill has
defended his lyrics as real-life reports from Houston's destitute
Fifth Ward. Publicist Heidi Robinson says to focus on the salacious
side of the group is to miss the point.
   ``This band is very, very three-dimensional. There are reasons
for the songs they've written,'' said Robinson. ``To dismiss them
as four guys doing this for shock value is to take them simply at
face value.''
   There's little doubt about the offensive content of the black
group's lyrics. ``Mind of a Lunatic'' details the rape and murder
of a woman; ``Trigga Happy Nigga'' is about a liquor store heist
and the slaying of a stool pigeon; ``Gangster of Love'' includes a
litany of graphic sex.
   ``This art perpetuates and makes acceptable certain violence
against women. We think that is abhorrent,'' said Francoise
Jacobsohn, president of the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women.
   Jacobsohn hailed Geffen's decision, but questioned why the Geto
Boys were singled out: ``We're pleased that misogyny and violence
are out, but we think the same set of rules should apply to Andrew
Dice Clay.''
   Publicist Robinson mentions the positive things the band is
about: ``Life in the Fast Lane'' is an anti-drug song. The group
wants to funnel some of its profits back into the Fifth Ward for a
boys' club. They encourage black youth to get an education.
   ``To focus on violence and sexism is to be flat,
one-dimensional,'' she said. ``They have an awful lot of good
things, too.''

   Pianist and composer Robert D.
Emmerich, who played with the Tommy Dorsey band and wrote songs for
Fats Waller, has died at age 83.
   Emmerich died Friday at Florida Medical Center, and a funeral
was held Sunday.
   Emmerich wrote more than 100 songs, including ``Beat It Out,''
``Woe Is Me'' and 10 others for Waller. He wrote ``Our Love,''
first sung by Dinah Shore, and ``No. 10 Lullaby Lane,'' introduced
by Kate Smith.
   Emmerich, who collaborated with Buddy Bernier and Joseph Meyer,
wrote a song called ``The Big Apple'' in the 1940s, said his wife,
Miriam.
   ``Walter Winchell liked it so much he started calling New York
`the Big Apple,''' his wife said.
   Emmerich also was a vaudeville, radio and night club performer.
   ``Bob was a self-taught piano player who couldn't read a note of
music, but he had some left hand,'' Mrs. Emmerich said.
   Emmerich, who was born in New York City, moved to Florida nine
years ago.

   There's a big difference, say Douglas Bernstein
and Denis Markell, between writing for a small stage and the small
screen.
   ``On television, you write a joke, then someone else decides if
it's funny or not,'' says Markell, the bearded, bespectacled member
of an up-and-coming writing team that at one time turned out TV
scripts for the likes of Ricky Schroeder on ``Silver Spoons'' and
for a short-lived fairy tale sitcom called ``The Charmings.''
   ``Everything goes up a level to that someone else and gets
rewritten, then up another level and rewritten and up a third level
and rewritten,'' Bernstein adds. ``Consequently, when you put names
of your own friends in the script, by the time it gets on the air,
the names are the friends of the producer.
   ``In our revue `Showing Off,' we've got all our friends' names in
it and nobody can change them,'' he says with a laugh.
   With their own show, Bernstein and Markell are helping to
resuscitate a neglected theatrical art form _ the topical musical
comedy revue. At one time, New York embraced those bright, witty
little shows, productions such as Ben Bagley's ``Shoestring Revue''
and his salute to Cole Porter or Julius Monk's entertainments at the
Plaza and Upstairs at the Downstairs.
   ``The revue puts such a premium on the words and the wit and
that's something that tends to get lost on Broadway today,'' says
Bernstein, who also is one of the show's four performers. ``The
revue asks an audience to sit down and pay attention. If you blink
or turn away, you sometimes miss the whole premise of a song.''
   ``Showing Off,'' currently running in a small Upper West Side
nightspot called Steve McGraw's, pokes fun at a variety of current
topics, although don't look for jokes about such easy targets as
Donald Trump, Dan Quayle or Leona Helmsley.
   Among its more unusual subjects are show-biz rabbis, video rental
addiction, New York's 72nd Street, a man who has a crush on a local
television anchorwoman and what Bernstein and Markell call
``S.I.P.,'' those self-important people like maitre d's, telephone
receptionists and box office personnel who enjoy their moments of
control over everybody else.
   ``We don't take the audience for granted,'' Markell says. ``We
assume that they come to the show with a certain amount of
intelligence, and we don't insult them. Rather than making an
audience scared, it makes them feel like they are contributing to
the show.''
   The collaboration between Markell and Bernstein is unusual. Both
men write music and lyrics. They don't divide the tasks so there is
a lot of trading back and forth of ideas.
   ``Music is a lot harder to write together,'' Bernstein says.
``And after it's done, you don't know who did what.''
   Who decides what the final version will be?
   ``In `Showing Off,' we have a wonderful director, Michael
Leeds,'' Bernstein says. ``The director, for us, has always served
as the ultimate referee.''
   Although only in their early 30s, both men were steeped in the
traditions of musical comedy.
   ``Denis and I were both lucky enough to be brought up by parents
who valued and respected the revue form,'' Bernstein recalls. His
father wrote for hotel revues in the 1950s. Markell's father was a
television producer as well as a set designer in the early days of
New York television.
   ``We listened to recordings of revues and were always told: `Look
who wrote these songs. This is where Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock
wrote their songs. This is where Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones wrote
their songs. And look what they went on to do,''' Bernstein adds.
``We've always viewed the musical revue as a not very distant source
for a lot of the great musical writers.''
   Bernstein and Markell met some 15 years ago at a music camp in
Raymond, Maine, where they would write ditties like ``The Bassoon
Teacher's Birthday.'' The two would sit on the main porch at the
camp's lodge and talk about current films such as ``Blazing
Saddles'' or favorite comics such as Woody Allen and Robert Klein
and make fun of the other kids at camp.
   Both writers attended Amherst College in Massachusetts where they
created a series of satirical revues. Among their performers was
Prince Albert of Monaco. ``He played a frog who turned into a
prince,'' Bernstein says.
   They came to New York in the fall of 1980. Markell ended up at
the BMI Workshop, a training ground for aspiring musical theater
writers guided at that time by the legendary conductor Lehman Engel
and later by such theater people as Maury Yeston, Ed Kleban and Alan
Mencken.
   A year later, the two were working for director Martin Charnin of
``Annie'' fame. He was looking for young, unknown writers to
contribute material to a revue, ``Upstairs at O'Neal's.''
   They wrote two of its brightest numbers _ ``Something,'' a parody
of a song called ``Nothing'' from ``A Chorus Line,'' and ``Momma's
Turn,'' a number supposedly sung by the mothers of New York drama
critics.
   A chance to work in television and films lured them to California
in 1986.
   ``We were lucky because an agent had seen a sample script of
ours,'' Markell says, ``and told us, `Come out to California.'''
   For eight months, they learned the discipline of television
writing, working on a schedule and reacting quickly to change.
   But their hearts belonged in New York and they returned. An early
draft of ``Showing Off'' was done in early 1987 and evolved into the
current production two years later. Now they are writing the book
and lyrics for a HBO project that will have music by Marvin
Hamlisch. But ``Showing Off'' is still on their minds. There may be
Los Angeles and Chicago editions of the show with new material
tailored to those two cities.
   ``We are determined to make the show feel specific so that the
audience would feel that they were at a special place,'' Bernstein
says. ``But at the same time we try to tackle issues and themes like
the man who has the crush on the TV anchorwoman, which are really
broader. So it's not really limited to New York.''

   People recognize the melodies if not the man
behind the music:
   ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'', ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Dear Hearts
and Gentle People,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``By a Waterfall,'' ``When I Take My Sugar to Tea,''
``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine.''
   These and scores of other songs are the life's work of Sammy
Fain.
   At 86, Fain is one of the last of a breed of songwriters who
wrote their way from Tin Pan Alley to Broadway to Hollywood during
the golden days between the two World Wars. Give them a job and
they'd write a song _ fast.
   ``You know, you'd get an assignment on Monday,'' Fain says
matter-of-factly, ``and they'd be rehearsing the orchestra by
Thursday. It's one of those things.''
   If his name isn't as well-known as a Rodgers, Gershwin, Porter
or Berlin, it may be because he never had a big Broadway musical,
although Fain did write the music for ``Hellzapoppin,'' the
long-running vaudeville escapade remembered more for the antics of
comics Ole Olson and Chic Johnson than its songs.
   The success that eluded Fain on Broadway was found in Hollywood:
dozens of film assignments, 10 Academy Award nominations and two
best-song Oscars for ``Secret Love'' and ``Love Is a Many
Splendored Thing.''
   Now theatergoers have a chance to sample a Fain rarity, ``Ankles
Aweigh,'' a 1955 Broadway musical that had nothing more on its mind
than gags, girls and a good time.
   The show is on view at the Goodspeed Opera House, that
ginger-box musical museum in East Haddam, Conn., best known as the
birthplace of ``Annie'' and for its sterling revivals of vintage
musicals from the 1920s and '30s. It will run through Sept. 30.
   A new book has been written for the musical by Charles Busch,
author and star of the long-running off-Broadway hit, ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom.'' Busch's revamped plot, still set in the 1950s,
had something to do with Hollywood starlets, the U.S. Navy, Italy
and a secret code coveted by the Russians.
   ```Ankles Aweigh' is an old-fashioned show,'' Fain said the
other day during a visit to the headquarters of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``It's got a lot of
good rhythmic tunes and ballads which I like to do.''
   Fain, whose family lived in New York, was born into music. His
father was a cantor. His older brother played violin in Broadway
pit orchestras. His cousin was Willie Howard, the great sad-faced
comedian.
   ``Every winter I would get pneumonia,'' Fain recalls, so the
family eventually moved from the city to the Catskills.
   ``Living up in the country, all I had was the piano,'' says
Fain, who taught himself to play and to write his own music. ``I
had a rather interesting little alto voice. I'd just get up and
sing my own material.''
   After high school, singing brought him back to New York and a
job as a staff pianist with Jack Mills who ran a music publishing
company.
   ``They hired me to demonstrate and teach their songs to all the
performing artists,'' Fain says. ``I would sell the songs to big
performers. It helped me learn to play in every key.''
   He also performed in vaudeville and on radio as part of an act
called Dunn and Fain. But he never stopping writing. His first hit
song, with lyrics by Al Dubin, was published in 1925. It's title
was ``Nobody Knows What a Redhead Mama Can Do,'' and Fain was on
his way.
   Two years later he teamed up with Irving Kahal, a young
vaudeville performer and writer. Their partnership took them to
Hollywood and back again to Broadway and lasted until Kahal died in
1942.
   In California, Fain and Kahal contributed songs to such movie
musical classics as ``Footlight Parade'' and ``Dames.'' The songs
they wrote during those days were sweet and saucy with titles like
``Two Little Flies on a Lump of Sugar'' and ``When You Were a Smile
on Your Mother's Lips (And a Twinkle in Your Daddy's Eye).''
   ``A good title is an incentive to me,'' Fain says. ``I'll change
my melody if I hear a good line. I'm not stubborn about it. That's
collaboration.''
   And Fain has worked with some of the best word men in the
business. Besides Kahal, his lyricists have included Al Dubin, Jack
Yellen, E.Y. Harburg, Mitchell Parish, Joe Young, Lew Brown, Ralph
Freed and Paul Francis Webster.
   ``When I play a good tune for a lyricist, it gives him some
construction,'' Fain says. ``Music can lead you to a different
construction and sometimes a good lyricist likes that. It gives
them a chance to dig for a different kind of rhyme.''
   ``Ankles Aweigh,'' which has lyrics by Dan Shapiro, originally
ran in New York for six months. Besides ``Hellzapoppin'' and its
sequel, ``Sons o' Fun,'' it was one of Fain's longer running
Broadway shows.
   Many of his other musicals, such as ``Christine,'' ``Something
More'' and ``Toplitsky of Notre Dame,'' disappeared quickly.
``Flahooley,'' a 1951 Fain musical that starred Yma Sumac, Barbara
Cook and Bil Baird's Marionettes, has developed an almost legendary
reputation.
   The score, one of Fain's best, graced a witty and satirical book
by E.Y. Harburg that told the story of a laughing doll and its
effect on the big business of toy-making.
   ``That show was the talk of Philadelphia,'' said Fain, recalling
``Flahooley's'' triumphant out-of-town opening. Only New York
seemed unimpressed and the musical died after only 40 performances.
   ``It was a very unusual show,'' Fain sats. ``Someday, somebody
will revive `Flahooley' and it will be a hit.''
   If the shows weren't successful, much of the music was. Consider
two of Fain's biggest hit songs _ ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and
``I'll Be Seeing You.'' They somehow survived a 1938 flop called
``Right This Way'' that lasted two weeks on Broadway.
   Fain keeps writing today _ turning out new songs at his home in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``I like to read the script,'' Fain says. ``That gives me an
idea for a melody. Many times, I play a certain little progression
and the lyricist will say `That's great.' If he doesn't like it,
I'll switch it around to fit a line. We help each other. That's the
way to work.''

   Irving Berlin's songs were so much a part of
America for generations that it would be hard to think of life
without him, his admirers said.
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone,'' said opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's
songs.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' Merrill said. ``He was not a
great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Berlin, whose most memorable compositions included ``White
Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade'' and ``God Bless America,'' died
Friday night at his home at the age of 101.
   Cabaret singer Bobby Short said he thought Berlin would be
remembered as ``a very, very, very important, very great American
composer. He is perhaps the last of the giants _ and I think that's
not a bad way to go.''
   ``His musicality was constantly astonishing. People who thought
they could pin down the Irving Berlin style would be surprised to
find his newest song a complete turnabout,'' Short said.
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers paid tribute to Berlin by humming a
phrase from his ``Cheek to Cheek.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang sadly in a telephone interview from
her home in Eagle Point, Ore.
   Breaking off to describe the thrill of working with Berlin and
Fred Astaire on the movie ``Top Hat,'' she said: ``It was like
heaven.''
   Miss Rogers recalled the songwriter's kindness when she was first
breaking into show business.
   ``I went into his music company to get some songs,'' she said.
``He had no reason to make charming conversation to me, but he made
very gentle conversation and encouraged me because I was very new to
show business.''
   Ronald Reagan, who in his acting days was featured in the 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' said: ``Nancy and I are deeply
saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical
genius delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``The
generations of people, millions of people, have danced to it, have
lived it, have romanced it.
   ``It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part
of our soul. It's the kind of finish of an era,'' Gould said.``I
can't believe that he's not here.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote 1969's Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music. His contributions to American popular music are
immeasurable.''
   Singer Paul Anka said: ``Throughout my career as a writer of
songs, I've always idolized Irving Berlin as the consummate master
of words and music.
   ``He wrote `God Bless America' _ May God bless Irving Berlin.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Bangles Put ``Everything'' Into New Album</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bangle Susanna Hoff's mom invoked the dreaded
``M-word'' when her daughter recently played her group's latest
album, ``Everything,'' for her.
   ``She thought it as more sophisticated and MATURE,'' than the
band's first two records, Hoffs said.
   Maturity may be a dirty word for many rockers _ and Hoffs quickly
disavowed her mother's language _ but it's an apt description for
both the record's sound and the approach the Bangles took in
recording their first album in almost three years.
   After two LPs and seemingly endless rounds of touring, the
Bangles say they finally feel comfortable with their craft.
   ``We're learning to trust ourselves more, to be more emotional in
our performance,'' said bass player Michael Steele. ``I don't really
know if you can call it maturity. It's more of an artistic growth.''
   The four women of the Bangles, who pay homage to classic bands of
the 1960s with their sunny melodies and intricate harmonies, became
stars with such hits as ``Walk Like an Egyptian,'' and the Prince
tune, ``Manic Monday,'' from the 1986 LP, ``Different Light.''
   The Bangles are thankful for their success, but said they needed
to take greater control over their music.
   Producer David Kahne, whose relationship with the band was stormy
at best, was replaced by Davitt Sigerson. Hoffs, Steele and sisters
Vicki and Debbi Peterson, who once readily accepted contributions
from outside songwriters, each wrote or co-wrote all of the new
album's 13 songs.
   When all four members of a band write songs, they notice when
their biggest hits are written by someone else. ``Walk Like an
Egyptian'' was written by Liam Sternberg, ``If She Knew What She
Wants'' is a Jules Shear song and the Bangles hit the Top 10 with a
cover of Paul Simon's ``Hazy Shade of Winter.''
   ``It was a reaction to the success of `Different Light' that made
us determined to write as many songs as we could come up with _
strong stuff that we could feel was emotionally attached to us,''
Steele said. ``We had a strange, slight feeling of distance from
`Different Light.'''
   The flip side to trusting your own instincts, of course, is
getting burned if the public rejects you. Some critics have grumbled
that ``Everything'' sounds overproduced and the songs don't sparkle.
But the public's responding to the first single, a Hoffs rocker
called ``In Your Room,'' which is moving swiftly up the charts.
   The Bangles say they liked the songs they wrote for this album so
much they couldn't bear to throw any away. Hoffs said it costs the
band money to pack the record with 13 songs instead of the
traditional 10.
   ``The thought of not having those extra three tracks on the
record just to save money makes no sense to me,'' Hoffs said. ``I'd
rather put out a record that we truly love.''
   ``That's why we got into it in the first place,'' Steele said.
``We're really oriented toward the music.''
   ``I got into it because of the fashion,'' Hoffs said, lampooning
her colleague's cliche.
   ``I do it for the boys,'' Steele shot back.
   They may joke about it, but the Bangles say they're tired of
defending themselves against people who denigrate their musical
ability because they're women.
   The Bangles knew Sigerson, who's produced Rickie Lee Jones and
David &amp; David, through mutual friends.
   ``We liked Davitt immediately,'' Hoffs said. ``He's been a
songwriter and he's from that orientation. We felt more comfortable
with someone we could talk to about our songs.''
   Those songs are generally the typical pop music fare of love won
and lost, with a few twists and turns. In ``Glitter Years,'' Steele
reminisces about the mid-'70s California rock scene and laments some
of its drug casualties. In the ballad ``Eternal Flame,'' Hoffs said
she used Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline as role models.
   ``We just sort of let each song lead us down whatever path it
would lead us, like putting on a blindfold and just going,'' Hoff
said. ``There's no formula. I wish sometimes there was. Everytime I
write something I rewrite it a billion times.''
   Hoffs said the Bangles feel grateful to get their songs on the
radio, since the singles charts are dominated by young heavy metal
bands and dance music.
   ``We grew up hearing the Byrds and Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and the
Doors on the radio,'' Steele said. ``Radio to us has never been a
plastic sellout.''
   The Bangles will spend much of 1989 touring to support a record
they say even moms and dads can love _ they know, because they've
asked theirs.
   ``I played it for my dad,'' Steele said. ``He said, `this is a
much more professional-sounding record.'''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Charlie Daniels And His Hard Driving Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firebrand fiddler Charlie Daniels called
the devil a nasty name in his million-selling record, ``The Devil
Went Down to Georgia.'' He also told the Russians where they could
go in his song, ``In America.''
   His new album, ``Homesick Heroes,'' is less polemical and
contains music that best portrays his band's style.
   ``It's what we are,'' he said. ``Hard driving music.''
   The rollicking album is the 18th in 17 years for the
irrepressible five-piece rock-country band that has performed in
all 50 states and several foreign countries.
   In it, Daniels plays a blazing fiddle to the flash point in
``Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues,'' a hit single. He plays
rousing guitar licks on other songs, and sings sassy, gritty vocals
on still others.
   The LP is a turn away from his last album, ``Powder Keg,'' which
he described as the most rock-oriented LP he has recorded.
   ``It didn't do too well at all,'' Daniels said in an interview.
``It's still selling, but it never really got off the ground.''
   ``It was time for a change. The new album is a career move.''
   Country fans will welcome the sound from the ``kingfish of
Southern roots music'' whose traditional garb is a huge bullrider
cowboy hat, cowboy boots, jeans and vest.
   He and his band are best known for their Grammy-winning 1980
hit, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia,'' the story of a feverish
fiddle contest between the devil and a boy named Johnny in which he
called the devil a mild obscenity. The single sold 1.6 million
copies and the ``Million Mile Reflections'' album that contained it
sold 2.3 million.
   ``It had mass appeal,'' Daniels said about the song. ``I guess
the lyrics of the song were responsible for 70-75 percent of the
popularity and the fiddle and the novelty value had a lot to do
with it.''
   The blunt lyrics in that song were similar to the ones in his
``In America,'' in which he issued his memorable directive to the
Soviets amid a burst of American pride.
   On topical subjects, Daniels' ``American Farmer'' focused on the
plight of agriculture in the mid-1980s. ``Still in Saigon'' was
about a former soldier haunted by his Vietnam experience. Other
songs by the band, such as ``Long Haired Country Boy'' and ``Uneasy
Rider,'' are more satirical.
   ``I poke fun at rednecks, hippies, politicians, all kinds of
people,'' said Daniels, a native of Wilmington, N.C.
   The band traveled 75,000 miles last year, making 116 concert
stops. In 1986, they grossed nearly $14 million and drew more than
750,000 paid admissions.
   Amid all the travel and hit records, Daniels has done a little
acting. He was in ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Lone Star Kid'' on
the Public Broadcasting Service.
   He and the band were featured in the movie, ``Urban Cowboy,''
and their ``Stroker's Theme'' was the title track for Burt
Reynolds' movie ``Stroker Ace.''
   Daniels' writing has not been restricted to songs. In 1985, he
wrote a book of short stories, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.''
   Daniels said one of his proudest achievements has been keeping
his band members together so long. Three members have been with him
at least 14 years.
   ``It seems like I've had Taz (DiGregorio, his keyboard player)
since two days after he was born,'' Daniels said.
   ``We're sincere,'' he said about the band's success and its
togetherness. ``I keep a 12-month payroll. We have the philosophy
that we do the best we can all the time. We get to stretch out some
as musicians. Everybody gets to use their ideas and share in the
songwriting royalties. I try to treat people well and look after
our folks.
   ``We try real hard,'' he said. ``I want to do the best I can do:
cut every record the best, write every song the best, do every show
the best, have the most efficient organization in the music
business.
   ``I want the deejays to pick up a Charlie Daniels Band record
and say, `Here's a record by the Charlie Daniels Band and I want to
play this.'
   ``Quality. You can't beat it.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: An Early Retirement After Hits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNNE BERNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are young and talented and plan to retire
by age 25.
   LeVert, the rhythm and blues pop trio of Marc Gordon and
brothers Gerald and Sean LeVert, has just released its third album,
``Just Coolin,''' a balanced collection of funk and melodic ballads
with snippets of dialogue interspersed throughout.
   ``We recorded those dialogue pieces spur of the moment, no
script. We were just acting silly and having fun,'' said Gerald
LeVert, a 22-year-old keyboardist and vocalist.
   But he takes a slightly different attitude towards most of the
music he has created. ``I get tired of hearing every album because
I wish I could do it differently,'' he said. ``You keep seeing how
you can do it better. ... I still have a lot to prove to the
industry.''
   His perfectionism, coupled with 24-year-old Marc's technical
expertise, has led to the development of their writing and
production team. ``Just Coolin''' showcases LeVert's complete
production responsibilities.
   ``It's not that I want to give up music by the time I'm 25, it's
just that I'd like complete control,'' Gerald LeVert said. ``The
hardest thing about the business is trusting people, and that's why
it's good to establish yourself as more than just an entertainer.''
   Gerald LeVert and Gordon have many projects under way, including
collaborations with James Ingram and Stephanie Mills, and managing
a new group, ``The Rude Boys.''
   The two also contributed to Miki Howard's duet with Gerald
LeVert, ``That's What Love Is,'' a Top 5 R&amp;B hit. They also helped
make Troop's ``Mamacita'' a success. The record was co-produced by
Gerald and Sean's father, Eddie LeVert, lead singer of the O'Jays.
Gerald LeVert and Gordon recently produced the latest O'Jays
record, ``Serious,'' which they said was their biggest challenge to
date.
   Ever since summers of being on the road with the O'Jays, Gerald
LeVert has thrived on the energy generated between the band and the
audience. He started writing songs with Gordon, who also plays
piano, when they met as teen-agers growing up in Ohio.
   ``My father would listen to the songs and would always say,
`Something's missing,''' Gerald LeVert recalled. ``Then we finally
started writing some good songs.
   ``We put out an album, `I Get Hot,' on an independent label
which sold 1,000 copies _ if that much. But we had a pretty big
record off that called, `I'm Still.' We did some shows and from
there we got the record deal from Atlantic.''
   In 1986, they released ``Bloodline.'' The first two singles from
this collection rocketed to the Top 10, with ``(Pop Pop Pop Pop)
Goes My Mind'' making it to No. 1 on the charts. In 1987, LeVert
came out with its second LP, ``The Big Throwdown,'' which yielded
three Top 10 singles, including the No. 1 ``Casonova,'' which
played on the soundtrack to the movies ``Fatal Beauty'' and ``The
Pick-Up Artist.''
   The group had its third No. 1 hit last year with ``Addicted to
You,'' which was featured in the movie ``Coming to America.''
   ``I think our romantic music is very sensuous, and our uptempo
stuff is something everyone can relate to _ it's funky,'' Gerald
LeVert said.
   ``I write songs thinking, `If we do this live, will it make them
groove or the girls scream?' But first I write for me. I'm very
critical. I don't think I'd write terrible, slop songs.''
   The title song on the new LP was originally written by Gerald
LeVert for the rapper Heavy D to perform.
   ``He took one look at what I wrote and did not like it. He wrote
another one in 10 minutes and that's the rap on the record,''
Gerald LeVert said.
   ``If my father doesn't like a song I've written, I'd think
twice. If I like it enough though, it's going to happen if I work
with it. It's only one person's opinion.''
   LeVert's energetic performances display the group's enthusiasm
for wanting to make the audience happy.
   ``That's the whole key: If you can laugh and have fun doing your
work, people see that and they feed off that,'' Gerald LeVert said.
``I love people singing along live and with the record. It's a
great high. The lyrics, harmonies and melodies are very important
for me, and it's important for people to be able to hum and whistle
your music.
   ``Usually I first come up with a concept, title or groove. I get
my ideas from TV, things I read, when I'm on the airplane _ from
anything. Then I give the idea to Marc and he does the music.''
   Gerald LeVert doesn't think LeVert will be changing its musical
formula, but he's toying with the idea of doing a solo album.
   ``I would want to do some social commentary, talk about
different things like family, the record industry, deceitful
women,'' he said with a big laugh.
   As far as the harmonious, close-knit group is concerned, Gerald
LeVert feels LeVert shows more signs of longevity than other groups
in the business.
   ``We have more finesse, more polish,'' he said. ``We're
vocalists. We don't need extra props. If we got a mike and a lamp,
we are going to be able to do what we do.''

   Pop star Stevie Wonder says justice is sweet
following a jury's rejection of a $25 million claim that his
Oscar-winner song ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen
from another songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was taken from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder, 39, offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing
a song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict
Thursday. His attorney, Herbert Dodell, said his client was wronged
by a star-struck jury and a biased judge.

   Soviet beauty queen Anna Gorbunova
declared her delight at becoming a ``true Christian'' after her
baptism in a Ukrainian Orthodox church here.
   Ms. Gorbunova, the Moscow secretary who became the first Miss
USSR last year, said she loved Sydney so much she decided to be

   ``I was very nervous in the ceremony; I had goose bumps all over

   In the Soviet Union, especially in the period before President
Mikhail Gorbachev consolidated power, ``there have been too many
restrictions concerning the practice of religion,'' said Ms.
Gorbunova's manager, Alexander Djamirze.

   Actress Valerie Harper says the suicide of Joan
Rivers' husband shook her out of the doldrums after she was fired
from her top-rated NBC sitcom.
   ``The week I was fired was the same week that Joan Rivers lost
her husband. I thought, `My God, I'm blessed.' Think of people with
real problems, who live with illness, with drive-by shootings in
their neighborhoods,'' Harper told USA Weekend magazine in Sunday's
edition.
   In her new show, ``City,'' Harper appears opposite her old show,
``The Hogan Family.'' She said she had some fears about becoming a
Hollywood pariah when she sued producers of ``Hogan'' following her
dismissal.
   ``There was definitely a buzz around town: `Has she gone mad?'
If I'd been a young actress ... I might have been destroyed,''
Harper said.

   A free-lance photographer claimed he was
roughed up by two of rock star Janet Jackson's bodyguards at a
hotel.
   Doug Mays, 40, of Moss Point, Miss., wanted the bodyguards
arrested after the scuffle Wednesday, but police officer Richard
Baily said he couldn't file charges because the parties involved
gave conflicting statements.
   Mays and his wife, Sammie, 32, said they were headed for the
15th floor of the hotel to meet ``Good Morning America'' host
Charlie Gibson who was doing his television program from Pensacola.
   Mays said they tried to get off the elevator on the 14th floor,
reserved for members of the Jackson tour, in search of a soft drink
machine. The photographer said he didn't know Jackson was in town.
   The bodyguards ``shoved me back in the elevator,'' said Mays,
whom police said was not hurt.
   The bodyguards, Jack Colen, 56, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.,
and Marcus David Johnson, 30, of Huntington Beach, Calif., told
police they pushed Mays after he used racial slurs when they told
him to leave.

   Boxing heavyweight champion James ``Buster''
Douglas' next fight may be in a courtroom, courtesy of a breach of
contract lawsuit filed by promoter Don King.
   King is seeking several million dollars in damages and also is
asking the U.S. District Court in Manhattan for an injunction to
prevent Douglas from fighting without his involvement.
   Douglas won the title with a shocking 10th-round knockout of
Mike Tyson on Feb. 11 in Tokyo. Douglas has said he will not fight
for King because the promoter challenged the result of the bout by
claiming that Douglas got a long count after being knocked down in
the eighth round.
   King's lawsuit claims he had an agreement with Douglas to
promote future fights.
   Douglas signed a conditional contract with Steve Wynn's Mirage
hotel-casino in Las Vegas for two fights, the first probably
against Evander Holyfield.

   An unlikely history and lingering mystery mingle
in a song that infused the old, rural South, emerged in the civil
rights movement, gained popularity and now has advanced into the
loftiest hymnals.
   Aspects of the song, ``Amazing Grace,'' are somewhat amazing
themselves, and haunting.
   ``There's a kind of wonderful calm that I feel when I sing this,
a kind of uncomplicated feeling, the way one felt as a child,''
says operatic contralto Jessye Norman.
   Country singer Johnny Cash says it's ``a song with no guile . .
. straight-ahead, honest, gut-level and heart-level. When I sing
that song, I could be in a dungeon, or I could have chains all over
me, but I'd be free as a breeze.''
   The lyrics were by a reformed 18th-century slave trader, the
variable melody clouded in folk origins, conceivably among slaves.
It imbued their ensuing culture and later spread through a
sophisticated world.
   Now a favorite American hymn, ``Amazing Grace'' also turns up
occasionally in rock concerts, and has been rendered in some
foreign languages.
   ``There is a power of reconciliation that takes place when I
hear it,'' says broadcaster Bill Moyers, who depicts the story and
impact of the hymn in an 80-minute show being presented Wednesday
by the Public Broadcasting Service.
   The first verse goes: ``Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, that
saved a wretch like me! I once was lost but now am found, was blind
but now I see.''
   The words were by John Newton, skipper of a British slave ship
who traded for human cargo in West Africa. A storm at sea sparked
religious faith and he later became an Anglican minister in Olney,
England.
   ``I was once an active instrument in a business at which my
heart now shudders,'' Newton wrote in his journals. ``A common
drunkard or profligate is a petty sinner to what I was . . . Oh, to
grace how great a debtor.''
   Newton became an advocate for abolishing the slave trade. His
journals describing its brutality helped an ally, William
Wilberforce, win British abolition of it.
   `` 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears
relieved,'' goes the second verse. ``How precious did that grace
appear the hour I first believed.''
   In the film, singer Judy Collins says:
   ``It was always the song that gave me an inner experience of
another dimension. I always feel that there's a mystical territory
between me and the audience.
   ``It's not just me singing . . . Somewhere or other, there is
some experience going on which gives something to them and gives
something to me, that's more than the sum of any of us.''
   The third verse goes, ``The Lord has promised good to me, his
word my hope secures; he will my shield and portion be as long as
life endures.''
   Says gospel singer Marion Williams: ``It gets to most everybody.
It gets to the heart of men.''
   An aged black ``wiregrass'' song leader, Dewey Williams, says at
his 91st birthday party in Ozark, Ark.: ``I feel good, I just can't
help it when I get to singing (that song). It just do something to
me.''
   The show ranges over many settings, from 18th-century sailing
ships to concert halls, from prisons to Mississippi voter
registration drives, from cemeteries to ``shape note'' singing in
Holly Springs, Ga.
   Says a Holly Springs man, ``It's just a good song, wrote like
it's supposed to be wrote.''
   On a tour of Japan by the Boys Choir of Harlem, director Walter
Turnbull says some foreigners don't understand the song's words,
``but it has such a universal flavor and the meldoy itself is so
beautiful it captures people.''
   The fourth verse goes, ``Through many dangers, toils, and
snares, I have already come; 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus
far, and grace will lead me home.''
   In a Huntsville, Texas, prison, an inmate says: ``I couldn't
hardly sing that song and get through, you know, four verses of it
without choking up . . . all I could do was just be humming and
crying.''
   Shown engraved on Newton's tombstone are his words:
   ``Once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa,
was by the rich mercy of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
preserved, restored, pardoned and appointed to preach the faith he
had long labored to destroy.''
   The fifth verse goes, ``When we've been there ten thousand
years, bright shining as the sun, we've no less days to sing God's
praise than when we'd first begun.''
   A Harlem choir boy says of his reaction to the song:
   ``I feel like I'm walking on a beach, and like wind is hitting
me, and stuff like that. That's how I feel about it. Not like a
rough wind; like a soft wind, just coming by, like a breeze.''

   Lamont Dozier wrote his first song when he was 11
years old, taking encouragement from a Detroit schoolteacher.
   He handed in a poem at school and the teacher put it on the
board. ``Usually the teacher would change the poem every month,'' he
recalled. ``My poem stayed on the board six months. That stimulated
me a lot to continue my writing. That lady did a lot for me. Later,
I managed to plunk out some melody on the piano to put with it.''
   Now 47, Dozier's supervising his 9-year-old son, Beau, in a Los
Angeles recording studio: ``He's a good little singer and a good
little songwriter.'' Dozier and singer-songwriter-drummer-actor Phil
Collins won a Grammy award and a Golden Globe for ``Two Hearts,'' a
song they composed for the movie ``Buster.''
   ``I was a nervous wreck on stage,'' Dozier said. ``I had blocked
it out of my mind. I hadn't entertained any ideas of winning it. My
heart just went boom boom. It was like I was going to pass out or
something.
   ``I was never nominated for anything. I've had gold and platinum
records over the years but no awards. The Golden Globe was the
first.''
   For 12 years, Dozier was part of a songwriting team known as
Holland-Dozier-Holland, which rose to fame at Motown Records. Dozier
and the Holland brothers, Eddie and Brian, were responsible for
``How Sweet It Is,'' ``You Can't Hurry Love'' and ``Stop in the Name
of Love,'' among others. Their biggest selling song was ``You Keep
Me Hanging On,'' a hit for the Supremes, Vanilla Fudge and Kim Wilde.
   But Dozier isn't bitter that he wasn't nominated for awards
before: ``Without sounding goody-goody or something, I'm a
songwriter. Just to hear my songs on the radio is reward enough _ as
corny as it may sound.
   ``I'm thrilled about all of this. The main thing is making the
product good. If it's not good, I don't want an award for it. First
and most important is the public and what they think of what I do.
That's who I'm writing it for.''
   Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1968 and ended their
partnership in 1972 because Dozier wanted to pursue a singing
career. ``I'll take another serious stab at it this year. Toward the
end of the year, hopefully I'll have an album out. I have interest
from two or three labels.''
   He's also writing a musical, ``Angels,'' and hopes to launch it
on Broadway. ``I'm the creator of the book and about 14 pieces of
music for it. I've had meetings with Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really
Useful Theater Company. Warner Bros. has signed me to a major
publishing deal because of it.''
   Dozier has been approached to write an autobiography titled ``The
Man in the Middle,'' because of the Holland-Dozier-Holland billing,
but he turned that down. ``There are some pages I want to fill in
first. I'm just starting.''
   Collins is the biggest star with whom Dozier has collaborated. He
recounted their meeting: ``I went backstage at one of his shows
here, you know how you do. I didn't know if he'd know what I did; I
was a little bit reluctant to take up his time.
   ``When I went in, an Atlantic Records publicity guy said, `I have
Lamont Dozier here.' He swung around and literally came and grabbed
and hugged me. It just blew me away. Come to find out, he collects
Motown memorabilia and I was one of his favorite writers. He wanted
my autograph and grabbed a guy to take a picture. He was totally
uncool.
   ``Shortly afterwards he called me. Did I have material for an
Eric Clapton album, `August,' he was producing? I sent him one
thing. He called again. Did I have another one? I dropped off a tape
at the studio. I was driving in my driveway and my wife, Barbara,
said, `Phil's on the line.' I heard the music in the background.
They'd already started recording it before I got home.''
   He was able to instantly submit a song because he writes four or
five hours a day. ``I've written over 700 songs and have some 400 or
500 unpublished and unrecorded. I make demos in my home.''
   Simply Red's latest album has a few Dozier songs on it. Boy
George's debut solo album has four. Dozier is now working with Steve
Perry on his new solo LP, talking with Lionel Richie about his
upcoming album and is writing eight songs with Collins.
   A year after the Clapton project, Dozier says, Collins was in
California. ``He dropped by the house. He wanted to talk about a
film, `Buster,' he had decided to do. He said he didn't want to have
anything to do with the music. He wanted to make a serious attempt
at acting.
   ``I came up with three things. I put the tracks down to give him
a feeling of what I was going for. I had titles; I hummed the
melodies. All of a sudden he wanted to get involved. He decided to
write the lyrics; he wanted Buster's point of view.''
   He also wrote ``Loco in Acapulco'' for ``Buster.''

<HEAD>Composer Frederick Loewe Remembered by Friends Red Skelton and
Leslie Caron</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Composer Frederick Loewe was fondly
remembered by friends Monday as a sentimental and caring man whose
classic tunes from the musicals ``Gigi'' and ``My Fair Lady'' will
be immortal.
   Loewe, whose partnership with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner produced
such romantic standards as ``I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,''
``If Ever I Would Leave You'' and ``On the Street Where You Live,''
died Sunday at Desert Hospital here of a heart attack. He was 86.
   ``His music will be immortal,'' said comedian Red Skelton, his
friend of 45 years. ``The world will always hear him speak, feel
his emotions, for he has only put on a shroud that makes him
invisible. He broke hearts on Valentine's Day. But perhaps, at
last, he found his Camelot.''
   Skelton will deliver the eulogy this week during a memorial
service here. The comedian said Loewe was much loved by members of
this exclusive desert community, and was also friends with area
residents Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.
   ``I'm very sad. He was an adorable person under his very rough
manner,'' said French actress Leslie Caron, who starred in
``Gigi.'' ``I was quite fond of him. He looked a bit like Edward G.
Robinson playing a gangster ... When I first met him he put me off.
Then I realized he was a softy.''
   ``He was a very sentimental and gentle man. He was always happy
and never gloomy,'' Skelton added.
   The Lerner-Loewe team enchanted audiences with tunes from such
classic musicals as ``Gigi,'' ``Camelot,'' ``My Fair Lady'' and
``Brigadoon.''
   Some of the other songs the team produced were ``Almost Like
Being in Love,'' ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' and ``Get Me to
the Church on Time.''
   Actor-dancer Gene Kelly, who starred in the film version of
``Brigadoon,'' praised Loewe as ``a fine musician who did great
things.''
   ``I was lucky to do `Brigadoon,' because it was a singer's
picture,'' Kelly recalled. ``But Frederick helped make it a
dancer's picture with my small Irish tenor called upon to sing all
those wonderful songs. He was a fantastic man, an eccentric and an
adventurer.''
   Loewe, known as Fritz, died Sunday at 1:51 p.m. at Desert
Hospital, where he had been admitted Wednesday for chest pains.
   Loewe had strong ties to the hospital, donating most of the
funds to build the Frederick Loewe Pediatric Pavilion in 1971, said
Bob Barcklay, the hospital's acting chief executive officer. Loewe
also donated royalties from some of his songs to the pediatric
unit, which are used each year to buy Christmas gifts and toys for
sick children there, he added.
   Lerner died in 1986. His widow, actress Liz Robertson, was in
Manchester, England, on Monday performing in a revival of ``My Fair
Lady.'`
   ``He was just a wonderful generous man who wrote the most
extraordinary, beautiful music. I'm pleased to be performing `My
Fair Lady' on stage in Manchester so that I can celebrate his life
by singing his music tonight,'' she said.
   Lerner and Loewe's partnership began with a one-night flop in
Detroit in 1942. They parted bitterly after ``Camelot,'' their last
Broadway hit, in 1960. After a 1973 reunion for the Broadway
production of ``Gigi,'' originally written in 1958 as a movie, they
remained friends.
   Loewe was born June 10, 1901, to a distinguished musical family
in Vienna, Austria. He began piano lessons as a boy and at 13 was
the youngest pianist to appear as soloist with the Berlin Symphony.
Loewe was 15 when he published ``Katrina,'' a song that sold 2
million copies on sheet music in Europe.
   He came to the United States in 1924 and later wandered the
country prospecting for gold, herding cattle, delivering mail on
horseback and teaching riding at a New Hampshire resort. As a
bantamweight boxer in Brooklyn, he won eight of nine professional
bouts.
   In 1931, Loewe married Ernestine Zerline, whom he divorced after
26 years together with no children. He has no survivors.
   He began his collaboration with Lerner after accepting an offer
from a stock company in Detroit to adapt a farce, ``The Patsy.''
   Lerner's fascination with the Scottish writer Sir James Barrie
led to the team's first hit show, ``Brigadoon,'' and their first
hit song, ``Almost Like Being in Love,'' in 1947.
   Loewe and Lerner went their separate ways for a time, but
reunited in 1951 to produce ``Paint Your Wagon.''
   Next came ``My Fair Lady'' in 1956, a musical adaptation of
George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' The cast included Rex Harrison
and Julie Andrews and ran for 2,717 performances.
   It won Loewe the first of two Tony Awards and the 1964 film
adaptation won several Academy Awards, including best picture.
   The team also produced a film musical, ``Gigi,'' based on a
novella by Colette, in 1958. It was the first film to win nine
Academy Awards, including an Oscar to Loewe as co-writer of the
title song.
   The next project was ``Camelot.'' Critics were hard on the
musical when it arrived in 1960 but it was greatly loved by
President John F. Kennedy, whose short-lived administration was
later dubbed Camelot by admirers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Rap has emerged as the most controversial form
of youthful expression since rock 'n' roll in the 1950s. There was
a time when Elvis was considered obscene, and had gone ``too far.''
Now groups such as the Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew have gone much
further.

   Houston rappers The Geto Boys are scatological,
misogynist, violent and homophobic, their critics say.
   Maybe, they respond, but they're not apologetic.
   ``The Geto Boys would rather be hated for what we are than loved
for what we are not,'' says Bushwick Bill, one-fourth of the
controversial crew whose new album made headlines before a single
copy was available.
   Hated? You've got it.
   An Indiana plant refused to press copies of ``The Geto Boys''
because of its offensive lyrics. Geffen Records backed out of a
national record distribution deal for the same reason. Two record
store chains will not sell the group's national debut.
   The National Organization for Women charges their lyrics promote
violence against women. The flap over their songs such as ``Mind of
a Lunatic'' and a pair of unprintable titles caused some people,
including ex-New York mayor Edward Koch to add their voices to the
anti-Geto Boys chorus.
   ``The Geto Boys sing rap songs so foul that their own record
company refuses to distribute their album,'' wrote Koch, who
decried their ``sickening lyrics'' and suggested the group
encouraged ``rape and mayhem.''
   Does all this bother Bushwick Bill? He responds with an
obscenity, a ``no'' and a fast-paced defense of his record.
   ``I always knew they can't stop the truth. The truth is going to
be heard. We're holding a mirror up to America, and letting them
see their naked selves. Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of
men? That's the mirror we're holding up,'' says Bushwick.
   It's also a mirror of Houston's Fifth Ward, the desolate
neighborhood the group once called home. Although none of the four
lives there anymore, it remains their base of operations.
   The band celebrated the release of its new album last month with
a party at Club Obsession in the old 'hood. The loyalty lies in
part with their support there; the band sold 500,000 copies of its
last album on the local Rap-A-Lot label before signing a national
deal.
   ``The Fifth Ward is shotgun shacks, houses ined up beside each
other. There's a lot of wild dogs, prostitution, needles on the
floor,'' says Bushwick. ``If you're walking down the street and you
look wrong, somebody'll beat your ... .''
   How it was growing up in the Fifth Ward is reflected in their
lyrics, in such songs as ``Assassins'' and ``City Under Siege.''
   ``Some kids never even make the milk cartons. That's why we can
hit hard like that, because that's how we grew up,'' says Bushwick.
``You step out the front door, it's survival. ... You only get a
minute to pray and a second to die.''
   The Geto Boys are not alone in the controversy over rap lyrics.
But unlike 2 Live Crew, who were recently acquitted of obscenity
charges in Florida, the Geto Boys choose not to use the First
Amendment as a explanation for their lyrics.
   ``According to the same Constitution, we're considered
three-fourths of a human being,'' Bushwick said. ``The First
Amendment doesn't apply to us. ... We've never been protected by
any American law.''
   The one song that has drawn the most criticism is ``Mind of a
Lunatic,'' in which the band details the rape and murder of a
random victim chosen only because her curtains are open. Bushwick
defends the song, comparing it to the work of Alfred Hitchcock.
   ``I don't get it. When Alfred Hitchcock directed `Psycho,' he
filmed from a maniac's point of view: his fears, his feelings, his
thoughts,'' says Bushwick. ``That's how we wrote `Mind of a
Lunatic.' Alfred did the same thing. ... I think it has a lot to do
with race.''
   The group, including the diminutive Bushwick, is all black.
   The flap over the album hasn't persuaded anyone in the band to
change his approach. In fact, says Bushwick, it has strengthened
their resolve to get it done their own way.
   ``We'll keep on calling it the way we see it,'' concludes
Bushwick. ``Just because it's not going on in your neighborhood
doesn't mean it isn't going on.''

   With a wicked smile and a wicked song,
Christopher Mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust.
   He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered,
high-society folk like Ivana (Trump), Nancy (Reagan), David
(Rockefeller), Brooke (Astor) and William (Paley). And they love it.
   In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old Mason has
gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Now
he's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the Algonquin
Hotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. Trump and
her yacht and Mrs. Reagan and her new life in California, but about
such topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combination
of Cole Porter and Tom Lehrer with a bit of Noel Coward thrown in
for good measure.
   ``I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,''
Mason explains. ``So if the evening is terrible, it's all my
fault.''
   It was never hard to get Mason to perform. He was born in
England, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the age
of 3, he saw ``The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at the
piano and played every song from the show _ with one finger.
   ``I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd be
playing Chopin or Beethoven, and I'd always think of what I thought
was a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling his
precocious childhood.
   At Cambridge, Mason majored in English and art history, but when
he came to New York, he worked long hours for little pay in public
relations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at close
quarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them.
   ``When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was thrown
toward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. ``People said, `Why
don't you do this all the time?'''
   He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired by
fashion designer Mario ``the Prince of Chintz'' Buatta to play for
a society dinner at the New York Public Library.
   Mason wrote five new songs for the occasion. ``If you are
burning with the love of learning, write a check to the public
library,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he also
wrote songs about Brooke Astor and Annette Reed, two of the biggest
supporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. Astor
change her first name from Brooke to Book and Mrs. Reed spell her
last name R-e-a-d.
   Mason was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'd
appear at their parties, playing original songs.
   ``I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. ``I'm English,
so I'm terrible at dealing with money.''
   At first, Mason would immediately say yes to a job and then ask
about the fee. Often it was less than $500. Today, he has an agent
at William Morris and his price for an evening's work can go as
high as $3,000.
   He serenaded Mrs. Trump last summer aboard the Trump Princess,
her husband's $30 million yacht.
   Mason writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but finds
pressure the best tonic for non-productivity.
   ``The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is
irresistible for writing new songs,'' he says.
   Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains.
   For the reopening of Blair House in Washington, Mason wrote a
song about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from New
York to the nation's capital.
   And for his Algonquin engagement, Mason has written different
types of songs.
   ``God knows, not everybody is interested in society's
darlings,'' he says. ``So I've written a love song or two. As well
as one number about the former president called `The Reagans at
Home in Bel Air.'''
   Mason suddenly begins reciting:
   ``The Secret Service is awfully nervous
   ``They can't think what to do.
   ``They are meant to take care of the Reagans
   ``But the Reagans seem awfully blue.
   ``They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk
   ``And the pressure's not fair.
   ``Though their friends bought them quite a swell house.
   ``It's no fun being the Reagans at home in Bel Air.''
   Mason also is working on a musical called ``How To Bag a
Billionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be called
golddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and not
necessarily love.
   ``I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, but
I won't be in it,'' he says.
   The show has been delayed while Mason completes his Algonquin
engagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and
the famous.
   ``I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ the
serious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' Mason says.
``I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I am
watching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybe
people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way
by having me around.''

WON 5 ACADEMY AWARDS, WROTE 'BODY AND SOUL';
</P>
<P>
COMPOSER-CONDUCTOR JOHN GREEN DIES AT AGE 80
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Composer-conductor-pianist-music executive John Green, whose film work won him
five Academy Awards and whose songs include "Body and Soul," "Out of Nowhere"
and "I Cover the Waterfront," died at his Beverly Hills home Monday night, it
was announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Frank Liberman, a family friend and publicist, said the diminutive, personable
musician was 80 and had suffered a stroke two years ago. The official cause of
death was listed as pulmonary edema, Liberman added.
</P>
<P>
Green, who wrote his first hit, "Coquette," while he was still a senior at
Harvard, was a dapper, confident and uncommonly articulate man whose trademark
was the fresh carnation he wore in his lapel every day. He said the flower was
to remind him of the beauty in the world and of his obligation to protect and
extend it if he could.
</P>
<P>
Long a fixture at Hollywood Bowl summer concerts, he was born to a wealthy and
cultured New York family. His father was a banker and builder after whom the
community of Greenhaven, Long Island, is named.
</P>
<P>
Green began piano lessons at age 3 and loved them. When he was 12 he was taken
to a party honoring George Gershwin, a friend of the family. The boy was asked
to perform for the composer and, marching to the piano, played his own
arrangement of one of Gershwin's songs.
</P>
<P>
Gershwin was evidently impressed and Green became a Gershwin protege and
lifelong friend. Green remembered, at 16, attending the premiere of "Rhapsody
in Blue" in New York. "The bloody place blew up," Green said.
</P>
<P>
In later years Green arranged much of Gershwin's music for movies and records,
including a delightful album of vocals by Fred Astaire. One of Green's Oscars
was for the scoring of "An American in Paris," based on Gershwin's music. Green
also frequently performed Gershwin in concert.
</P>
<P>
The elder Green wanted his son to go into Wall Street. Reluctantly but
dutifully, Green rushed through the rigorous, progressive Horace Mann School
and entered Harvard at 15, majoring in economics.
</P>
<P>
But he was already deeply involved in music and spent the summer between his
junior and senior years living in Cleveland and writing arrangements for the
new Guy Lombardo orchestra. (One of his pals that summer was the young
publicist for a Cleveland movie house named Lew R. Wasserman, who in subsequent
years was Green's agent at MCA and eventually head of that giant entertainment
company.)
</P>
<P>
But Green's father remained unimpressed. "Son," his father told him, "you can
be a good banker, a good lawyer or doctor and you'll be a proud, respected
citizen in the community. But there is no bum in the world like an artist who
is merely good, and I'm afraid as a musician you are merely good."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Wall Street Job
</P>
<P>
Green graduated from Harvard in 1928 at only 19. Despite the fact that his
early song "Coquette" was the biggest sheet-music seller in the country, he
bowed to his father's will and took a job on Wall Street. "I was a sissy to do
it," he confessed years afterward.
</P>
<P>
He used his music royalties to pay for visits to a psychiatrist. Then, after
six months, he defied his father, quit his job and became a rehearsal pianist
at the Paramount studio in Astoria, Long Island, for $50 a week.
</P>
<P>
He was also writing songs, often partnered with lyricist Edward Heyman, a
friend of friends, a wealthy young Midwesterner whose family had prospered in
sausage casings. In 1931, they wrote a package of four songs for Gertrude
Lawrence for $250.
</P>
<P>
"One of them had to be a comedy number, one an up-tempo item, one a ballad, one
a torch song. The torch song was 'Body and Soul,' " Green said not long ago.
Did he know he was writing a classic? a reporter asked him. "I only knew I was
writing for Gertie for Wednesday," Green said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copyright Sold
</P>
<P>
Green and Heyman had actually sold the copyrights to the singer. But when
another singer, Libby Holman, asked permission to use the song in her own act,
Lawrence generously gave the song back to Green and Heyman. As it turned out,
the royalties from "Body and Soul" would have assured their lifetime solvency
if nothing else had. A favorite with both singers and jazz instrumentalists, it
is one of the most-recorded songs in the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
During his Astoria stay with Paramount, Green did his first bit of
movie-scoring, an arrangement of "You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me" for
Maurice Chevalier. Green is also credited with the music for a forgotten 1930
film called "The Sap from Syracuse."
</P>
<P>
In 1932, Green conducted the house orchestra for the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz
Hart musical "By Jupiter," and at the time his principal ambition was to write
for the musical theater. He wrote show tunes for Jack Buchanan and other
performers, but the one musical he wrote a few years later closed out of town,
in Boston, and he did not try another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed Dance Orchestra
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of William Paley of CBS, Green (who then was still Johnny
rather than John) formed a dance orchestra. It opened the St. Regis roof, a
posh new night club that opened after the repeal of Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
Green was also the orchestra leader on several coast-to-coast radio programs,
including the Philip Morris Hour, the Packard Hour with Fred Astaire and the
Jell-O Show. His sidemen on the early radio shows included Artie Shaw and Benny
Goodman (in the same reed section), Tommy Dorsey and Bunny Berigan.
</P>
<P>
Green and the orchestra starred in a memorable short, "Music Magic," in which
trick photography reduced Green to a Tom Thumb miniature amid the full-sized
band. The film is still occasionally shown on television. He remained an
orchestra leader until 1939, when he gave it up to try his hand at the
unsuccessful musical.
</P>
<P>
In 1942, Green left New York for Los Angeles. He did a season as musical
director of the Jack Benny radio show, doubling as a comic foil specializing in
dialects. He also began his major work as a film composer, initially at Metro
Goldwyn Mayer, where he scored, among others, "Bathing Beauty," "Easter Parade"
(for which he won an Oscar), "The Great Caruso," "Brigadoon" and "Raintree
County."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MGM Musical Director
</P>
<P>
For a decade, 1949-58, Green was musical director at MGM, an executive position
in which he earned a reputation as a hard but fair taskmaster. He could imagine
his father, Green said, whirling in his grave at the thought of his son being
more than a musician at last.
</P>
<P>
But Green chafed at overseeing the work of others. "I'm glad I had the guts to
assign myself the music for 'Raintree County,' " he said in a Times interview
in 1973. It was the film music of which he was proudest and was nominated for
an Academy Award (one of 14 nominations in his career), but lost to Malcolm
Arnold's score for "Bridge on the River Kwai."
</P>
<P>
He left MGM for a similar role as musical director at Desilu and, after a brief
stint, became a free lancer, winning two more Oscars for the musical direction
of "West Side Story" in 1961 and "Oliver!" in 1968.
</P>
<P>
His fifth Academy Award was as producer of an MGM musical short based on "The
Merry Wives of Windsor Overture."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guest Conductor
</P>
<P>
Green recalled seeing his first performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 1921, a
concert version of "Carmen." He returned to the Bowl as a guest artist in 1945.
Then in 1949, he began a series of appearances as a guest conductor of pops
concerts that lasted without interruption until 1966, when he was away in
London for two years working on "Oliver!"
</P>
<P>
During this period Green also conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic's
Promenade concerts of light classics (1959-63). He continued to conduct at the
Bowl for several years after his return from London, making his 32nd appearance
in the summer of 1984.
</P>
<P>
In later years, he appeared as conductor and pianist with several symphony
orchestras across the country. His one-movement symphony, "Mine Eyes Have
Seen," was commissioned by the Denver Symphony and performed at the dedication
of its Boettcher Concert Hall in 1978. In June, 1988, in conjunction with the
60th reunion of his Harvard class, Green conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Name
</P>
<P>
As he moved out of song-writing into more serious conducting, he was persuaded
that "Johnny" was insufficiently dignified and he became John Green, although
he remained Johnny to old acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
He was a four-term director of the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers and had been active as a fund-raiser and mentor for the Young
Musicians Foundation, among several other organizations. He was a longtime vice
president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and chairman of
its music branch. He conducted the Academy Award presentations 10 times.
Pepperdine University gave him an honorary degree in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Green was married three times. His first was to debutante Carol Koshland when
he was 20. By his second wife, television consumerist Betty Furness, he had a
daughter, Barbara, an actress in Los Angeles. In 1943, he married Bonnie
Waters, a statuesque actress who was under contract at MGM. She survives him
along with their two daughters, Kathy, a composer-performer who lives in New
York, and Christopher Allyson (Kim) Green-Meglio of Los Angeles. Four
grandchildren also survive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended Luncheon
</P>
<P>
Although he had suffered a stroke in October, 1987, and had been in failing
health since then, he attended a luncheon in his honor given by the Pacific
Pioneer Broadcasters last September when he was saluted by fellow film
composers Henry Mancini, John Williams and Arthur Hamilton, among others.
</P>
<P>
In what turned out to be his last public tribute, the Beverly Hills Pops
Orchestra gave a concert in Green's honor on his 80th birthday, last Oct. 10
with Bill Conti conducting and songs performed by Dinah Shore, Tony Martin,
Rosemary Clooney and Carol Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
He had remained active until a few days before his death, producing as recently
as last Sunday the annual gala for the John Douglas French Foundation for
Alzheimer's Disease, of which he was a founder.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the foundation said that although confined to a wheelchair, he
had lined up the talent for the fund-raiser and "did everything but conduct the
orchestra," as he usually did.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Green said there will be a private celebration of her husband's life on
Monday. In lieu of flowers, donations are asked to the French Foundation, 11620
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90025 or to the Bel-Air Presbyterian Church, where
a new organ will bear his name.

   Little Casey Schlitz, whose dad is a
songwriter, had just learned the Lord's Prayer and got into the
habit of saying ``forever and ever, amen'' at the end of everything
he said.
   Schlitz and a hot singer-songwriter named Paul Overstreet
started tinkering with what the 4-year-old said and turned it into
the 1988 Grammy-winner ``Forever and Ever, Amen,'' which was
recorded by country star Randy Travis and became one of the biggest
hits in recent years.
   ``We started monkeying around with it, and before you knew it,
it started being fun,'' Overstreet recalled. ``It was done in an
hour and a half or so, and we had an idea who should sing it.
   ``It was a unique way to say something at that time, but it
didn't give me chills the first time I heard it. A lot of the
success was due to Randy Travis' popularity at the time.''
   Overstreet was surprised to win a Grammy for the song.
   ``I don't think it's sunk in yet to be recognized with the `big
boys.' That's the big leagues there. Being a country boy from down
in Mississippi and going to New York (for the Grammy show), it was
pretty neat. It was an opportunity you don't get every day.''
   Sixteen years ago, Overstreet, who was born in Newton, Miss.,
and raised in Vancleave, arrived in Nashville without a job and
homeless. He slept in an empty church until he could find work as a
welder. Then he finally broke into the music business, writing and
singing. In the past three years, he's probably been the top
songwriter in country music.
   He wrote ``On the Other Hand,'' also recorded by Travis, which
was voted song of the year in 1987 by both the Country Music
Association and the Academy of Country Music. And he wrote or
co-wrote a string of other country hits: ``Diggin' Up Bones'' and
``Deeper Than the Holler,'' both recorded by Travis; ``When You Say
Nothing at All,'' recorded by the late Keith Whitley; ``Same Ole
Me,'' by George Jones; ``You're Still New to Me,'' by Marie Osmond
and Paul Davis; ``One Love at a Time,'' by Tanya Tucker; and ``I
Fell in Love Last Night,'' by the Forester Sisters.
   As a recording artist, his debut RCA album ``Sowin' Love'' has
produced two hit singles this year: the title cut plus ``Love Helps
Those.''
   The 34-year-old Overstreet has also tackled an alcohol and drug
problem, and says he's found an inner peace after quitting
substances four years ago. That's when his songwriting career also
blossomed.
   ``I'm in a real peaceful place with myself right now,'' he said.
``I still expect quite a bit from myself, but I feel I'm in the
right place on the right road and I'll progress as time goes on.
This is the first time in my life I can actually say I'm on the
right road. I feel I'm building in the right direction.''
   He used cocaine and developed a reputation as one of the biggest
boozers in music industry hangouts. ``I drank 'til it was over,''
he recalled. ``It was a miserable time.
   ``I definitely was wasting my talent. I didn't finish songs. I
didn't have the energy to work. I was operating at 25 to 50 percent
of my capabilities on an average.''
   In his songwriting, he tries to convey positive messages and
talk about life's potentials.
   ``I've tried to say things in songs to encourage people rather
than take advantage of weaknesses,'' Overstreet said. ``I try to
see things that would help people see how things could be.
   ``I try to sew a lot of that into the songs. It's a real
complicated process. I'll think of something in a way I've never
looked at it before. Then I can formulate the two ends together
with the chorus in the middle.
   ``I try to paint the picture, set the story I'm developing
around the idea. At that point, the lyrics and music kind of come
together.''
   And that's how ``Forever and Ever, Amen'' happened.
   A memorable line from the song is ``as long as old men sit and
talk about the weather, as long as old women sit and talk about old
men.''
   ``That's pretty plain,'' Overstreet said. ``It's real. It hit
the heart of a lot of people.''

On Film: The Road to 'Ishtar'
---
By Julie Salamon</HL>
<DD> 05/14/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Show-business people "in the know" wrote "Ishtar" off months ago.
It didn't matter that they hadn't seen the picture yet -- or even that it wasn't finished.
They just knew.

   In other words, "Ishtar" had bad word of mouth.
It had bad word of mouth because people in the know knew that a $40 million road picture directed by Elaine May would bomb.
They also knew they didn't want to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a road picture.

   I mention all this only because occasionally a picture is burdened by such dismal advance vibrations that it ends up benefiting from the "it wasn't so bad" factor.
In other words, the market discounts its stock and then discounts it again on the upside.

   What I'm saying is that "Ishtar" isn't so bad.
It has some of the funniest bad song lyrics ever written, some amusing moments with a blind camel, and occasional flashes of Ms. May's quirky brilliance.

   Now all that may not add up to $40 million worth of movie.
But that's for shareholders of Coca-Cola Co. and Time Inc. to worry about. ("Ishtar's" distributor, Columbia Pictures, is a subsidiary of Coke, and Time's Home Box Office co-financed the movie.)
The $40 million (more or less) spent to make the movie should bother the rest of us only because "Ishtar" looks overproduced for what it is.

   What it is, or, what it's trying to be, is a copy of the old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road pictures -- dopey, slapstick adventures with a kind of haphazard charm exuded by brand-name stars.
Perhaps because of Ms. May's reputed perfectionism, and certainly because of the overly polished settings, there is no haphazard feeling to "Ishtar."

   With some exceptions -- Charles Grodin, in a sly cameo as a CIA spook and Mr. Hoffman here and there -- the whole undertaking seems labored.
I wanted to like it, but I kept feeling as if I were watching an unsteady comedian deliver the punch line before he's told the joke.

   The story Ms. May has written is silly and slight enough to be the scenario for a "classic" road picture.
Two untalented lyricists and even more untalented singers sign up for a gig at a tourist hotel in Morocco.
They find themselves embroiled in a preposterous political quagmire at the center of which is a beautiful girl.
Here, the part once played by Dorothy Lamour went to the lovely French actress and off-screen Beatty-pal, Isabelle Adjani.
The male stars get to dress up like sheiks, ride camels and tell jokes that play off their real-life personas. (So Mr. Beatty, reputedly an "homme fatal" in real life, keeps musing aloud about his character's inability to attract women.)

   Turning this kind of froth into a big-budget production does seem like a foolhardy idea, particularly considering Ms. May's subdued approach to comedy.
Originally half of a comedy team with Mike Nichols, she went on to write plays and movies that drew from her uniquely befuddled yet acute sense of satire.
She wrote and directed "The New Leaf" and "Mikey and Nickey," directed "The Heartbreak Kid," and wrote "Heaven Can Wait" for Mr. Beatty.
She has a deft touch and a marvelous comic vision, but her jokes aren't big yuks.

   They are subtle yuks that often get lost in the overblown goings-on she's put them up against in "Ishtar."
The leading comedy duo doesn't help.
Mr. Beatty has a kind of winsome charm as Lyle Rogers, the dizzy former ice-cream truck driver who knew he was destined to become a songwriter when he'd compose ditties like "Hot Fudge Love" while driving his route.
But charm is a Beatty trademark.
He's so understated here, though, that the charm doesn't fully emerge.

   With Mr. Beatty behaving in this whispery fashion, the comic burden is left on Mr. Hoffman's game shoulders.
He's Chuck Clarke (get it?
Rogers and Clarke?), a songwriter so dense he serenades a couple celebrating their 53rd wedding anniversary at a restaurant where he's the entertainment with this lyric: "I'm leaving some love in my will."
Still, although Mr. Hoffman seems tense in many scenes, when he's funny, he's very funny.

   It's also true that he and Mr. Beatty are a funny pair to look at, the world's highest priced sight gag -- the big, lumbering Mr. Beatty alongside his bantam companion.
But never in the film do they seem in tune with Ms. May's offbeat rhythms.
Mr. Grodin, however, never misses a beat.
Whenever he's onscreen as the blandly ruthless CIA man, you see what a giggle the whole picture might have been.

   As it stands, awkward as a boy who walks naked into the "Y" pool and discovers a crowd gathered for a swim meet, "Ishtar" provides embarrassment, but also laughter.
Ms. May has written some great jokes and clever lines: for example, the way Jack Weston, who does a brief but amusing stint as the low-level talent agent who represents the duo, sums up his clients' career prospects.

   "Frankly you're old," he says.
"You're white.
You got no shtick."

   The movie's cleverest running gag may also be its downfall.
Ms. May and Paul Williams have written some hilariously rotten songs.
"There's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/Look around, see if there's something in your size."
That sort of thing.
These are the kind of awful lyrics an astute lounge-lizard mimic such as Bill Murray could have a lot of fun with.
But Messrs.
Hoffman and Beatty are so tone-deaf they don't even know how to play the songs for deadpan humor.
They seem old, white and without shtick.

   ---
   Eddie Murphy, however, is young, black and overflowing with shtick.
Maybe one day he'll come to his senses and get new advice on what movies he chooses to display his talents.
You can see him in "Beverly Hills Cop II," but do yourself a favor: Rent the original and watch it at home.
It didn't seem like a masterwork then, but, compared with the sequel, it sure does now.

   The 16 musicals created by George and Ira
Gershwin between 1921 and 1933 were not written for posterity. They
only had a life expectancy of their original Broadway runs.
   When these shows closed after six months or sometimes a year, no
one ever bothered to preserve all the material from them. Hit songs
such as ``The Man I Love,'' ``I Got Rhythm,'' ``Someone To Watch
over Me,'' ``S'Wonderful'' and others survived, but the musicals
they were from often did not.
   There wasn't the sense that anyone would want to hear - some 50
or 60 years later - the entire score from ``Girl Crazy,'' ``Strike
Up the Band,'' ``Treasure Girl,'' ``Funny Face,'' ``Lady, Be
Good!'' and ``Tip-Toes.''
   With the advent of the cast album in 1943 that changed.
Audiences found a way to keep alive their memories of original
performances. But George and Ira Gershwin had written their last
Broadway show nearly a decade earlier.
   Now a major recording project is under way to document all the
Gershwin theater works, including the shows lyricist Ira Gershwin
wrote with other composers, such as Kurt Weill, Vernon Duke and
Arthur Schwartz. The recordings will use scores carefully
reconstructed from original manuscripts.
   The comprehensive effort has been financed by Leonore Gershwin,
Ira's widow. Mrs. Gershwin, now 90, formed Roxbury Recordings,
named after the stately drive in Beverly Hills where the couple
lived and where she still lives.
   ``She has taken it as a mission in life to make sure that the
works of her husband and his brother are preserved in the best
possible way,'' says Michael Strunsky, Mrs. Gershwin's nephew who
represents her on the project. ``My aunt wants people forever to
hear what George and Ira really wrote, at a quality level they
would be proud of.''
   The company's first effort, released in December on Electra
Nonesuch Records and done in collaboration with the Library of
Congress, is ``Girl Crazy,'' a 1930 Gershwin musical trifle
fashioned for Willie Howard, a big musical comedy star of the day.
The original show also featured two teen-agers, one named Ethel
Merman and the other Ginger Rogers.
   The new release, the first complete recording of the show, stars
Lorna Luft in the Merman role, Judy Blazer singing Rogers' part,
David Carroll and Frank Gorshin.
   ``In a sense, we are the show's original cast album,'' says
Luft, who had the daunting task of singing ``I Got Rhythm'' and
``Boy! What Love Has Done to Me!'' - two songs closely associated
with Merman throughout her career.
   ``There were no modern interpretations on the recording,'' Luft
says. ``There is a tendency, of course, with songs like `I Got
Rhythm' to use a more up-to-date vocal style. I had to not use it
at all.''
   ``You want to exude a sense of fun with this music,'' says John
Mauceri, conductor of the new recording and a champion of restoring
old Broadway musicals for stage and record. ``It should be quite
contagious.
   ``Sometimes you'll hear a recent recording of an old show, and
it sounds like an adult education course. And then when you listen
to the original performers on old 78 records, you smile. One of the
things I wanted to make sure was present in this music was its
smile. `Girl Crazy' is one of the happiest scores George and Ira
ever wrote.''
   Listen to modern versions of ``I Got Rhythm,'' Mauceri says.
Most singers seem to get the rhythm wrong.
   ``If you're doing it right, it's very entertaining,'' he says.
``The orchestrations and the arrangements really only work when you
sing them in the right style.''
   The problem is that most of those original orchestrations have
long disappeared. Research was required to put the shows back into
their original state.
   Restoration work on ``Girl Crazy'' was supervised by Tommy
Krasker, producer of the recording series and archivist for the
Gershwin estate. His task, which took about six months, was made
easier because much of the show's original material, including
orchestrations, was available.
   Krasker was not so lucky with ``Strike Up the Band,'' the second
show in the project, which was recorded in early December with
Mauceri again conducting. An extensive research effort had to be
undertaken.
   At the Gershwin home in California, Krasker pored over musical
manuscripts, lyric sheets and scrapbooks about the show. He scoured
old reviews and other newspaper articles, listened to period
recordings and studied photographs.
   ``Strike Up the Band,'' which originally had a book by George S.
Kaufman, was one of the Gershwins' most interesting failures - and
successes. A 1927 version of the show closed in Philadelphia and
never made it to New York. A revised version became a hit three
years later. Roxbury has recorded both versions and will release
them next summer.
   The first version of ``Strike Up the Band'' was a dark comedy,
an anti-war piece about the United States going to war with
Swizterland to protest a tariff on Swiss cheese. The second, with a
revised book by Morris Ryskind, softened the anti-war tone, turning
the war into a dream sequence and the fight over cheese into a
battle over chocolate.
   ```Strike Up the Band' certainly was ground-breaking in terms of
subject matter, characterization, integration of script and
score,'' Krasker says.
   The problem was that outside of piano-vocal material and lyric
sheets, not much of the original remained. Out of some 40 songs in
the two versions of the show, Krasker found orchestrations for only
six.
   What he did was hire six of the theater's most accomplished
orchestrators - Sid Ramin, Bill Brohn, Dick Hyman, Russell Warner,
Larry Wilcox and Ralph Burns - to write orchestrations in the style
of the period.
   All the lyrics for ``Strike Up the Band'' were found, and only
one piece of music - the verse to a song called ``Meadow Serenade''
- was missing. Its refrain had been remembered by Kay Swift, a
composer and good friend of George Gershwin.
   Krasker asked Burton Lane, composer of ``Finian's Rainbow'' and
a one-time collaborator of Ira Gershwin, to write a new verse.
   ``A few days after I handed him the lyric, he came in with a
tune that was absolutely wonderful,'' he says. ``It feels like it
was all written in one stroke. Burton's verse and George's refrain
complement each other beautifully. I have to think it's going to be
one of the highlights of the recording.''

Are Music to Ears
Of Robert Warren

He Writes Songs Lambasting
Life's Injustices, Insanities;
A Gripe for Frank Perdue

<TEXT>
   If they set up an Old Curmudgeon prize, Robert A. Warren figures as a shoo-in.
"I'll take on anybody bigger than me," he says.
"I'll never take on a little guy."

   Many are bigger.
Mr. Warren is 126 pounds arranged on a pencil-shaped physique.
He is 71 years old and ailing.
In his New York Mets cap, hooded sweatshirt, jeans and sneakers, all blue, he looks more cuddly than menacing.

   However, he has taken on all sorts of targets -- the telephone company, the U.S. Postal Service, yuppies, soap operas, greedy people, the Moral Majority and politicians, to mention a few -- with the following weapons: an old grand piano, a raspy, penetrating singing voice and a knack for writing satirical little songs that bite.

   Take, for example, these verses from his "Yippie-Yupppie-I-Ay":

   Our kitchen's equipped with the basic necessities:

   Cuisinart, cookbooks and pasta machine,

   But we never use 'em 'cause we mostly dine out
   On fancy, extravagant nouvelle cuisine.

   You won't find us fillin' our tummies with burgers,

   And tuna on white is a cardinal sin.
   We lay in gourmet from the neighborhood shops --

   If it wasn't for takeout, we'd never eat in.
   Mr. Warren is a songwriter turning into a performer in his eighth decade.
Like many people, he feels that the world is bristling with swinishness and woe.
But rather than subsiding into impotent indignation, he works off his bile by writing a mocking tune and laughing at the whole silly business.

   Many of his songs don't get performed.
"I file 'em up here," he says, touching his temple as he plays the piano in his cluttered Manhattan apartment.
Some of his subjects -- like comedian Joan Rivers ("my darling Joan"), conservative Phyllis Schlafly ("she's all the woman any man could need") or hotelier Leona Helmsley ("Leona, the Palace queen") -- might be happier if their songs were unaired.

   Mr. Warren's muse is stirred by subjects ranging from the cost of chicken to public affairs.
"Haldeman, Erlichman, Mitchell and Dean," a song popular in the early 1970s, was one of Mr. Warren's, though he didn't perform it.
Now there are the Wall Street scandal and the White House-Iran affair.
"Nothing has changed," he says.
"It's insane."

   "Insanity," in fact, is the title of his new record album.
On Thanksgiving eve, just before appearing on the "Today Show," Mr. Warren penned new lyrics on Iran and Ivan Boesky for the album's title song.
The president, he noted,

   ...beat his manly breast and vowed he'd rid the world of terror.

   He first laid all the blame on Carter for Iran,

   And then went out and fixed it so it's hitting the fan.
   Mr. Boesky got this broadside:

   By ratting on his closest pals and turning fink,

   So far he's kept his freedom and avoided the clink.
   Mr. Warren says his songs are for "kids over 12 with an IQ over 50 who can stand upright."
There isn't much for that audience now, he says.
Movies and television, he argues, have been "turned over to the 12-year-olds."
Rock music gets bad grades, too.

   College radio stations have been playing Mr. Warren's "Dr.
Ruth," "The Takeover Tango," "Greed" and some of the other songs on the "Insanity" album, and the students seem to like them.
"I've had some really good response," says David Brennan, the general manager of WERG-FM in Erie, Pa., the home of Gannon University.

   "He's no Pavarotti," Mr. Brennan adds.
James Brady, a columnist for Advertising Age and a Warren crony, says his friend's singing voice sounds like "a muffler commercial."
But it seems to suit the satirical material.

   "I'm not by nature a ham," says Mr. Warren.
"I grew up in New England, where you're taught not to show emotion."
But on the "Today Show," with millions watching, he sang and hammed as though he were with friends at home.
"I like people, and it shows," he says by way of explanation.

   Mr. Warren spent some 25 years arranging and writing music for the likes of Artie Shaw, Eddy Duchin and Guy Lombardo and publishing some music himself.
He soured on the commercial-music scene after rock took over.
"I had some bad habits, like rhyming," he says.

   But the Don Quixote inclination had been lurking all along.
The telephone company is a longtime foe.
Back in 1972, Mr. Warren sued the utility in small-claims court -- "for lousy service," he says.
When the old exchanges gave way to all-number codes, Mr. Warren wrote a musical lament to one of them: "Poor little Wickersham-2, how could they do that to you?"

   Watergate fanned Mr. Warren's dissatisfaction into an eternal flame of dissent.
"I kept writing these things so I could keep my sanity," he says.

   Riding buses, or sitting in his apartment reading stacks of newspapers, he muses on the latest outrage and crafts lyrics to fit.
For example, when the Sgt. York air-defense failed to work, Mr. Warren wrote a song for the Pentagon, "Back to the Drawing Board Blues."

   One song imagines the "steely dark eyes" of Leona Helmsley finding a bit of lint on the jacket of a captain in a Helmsley hotel, whereupon the captain finds himself unemployed.
In another, Mr. Warren naughtily fantasizes about Mrs. Schlafly greeting him in the evening "with a cold martini in a filmy negligee."

   Some grievances are too recent to have coalesced into song.
"I'm going to write a stinging letter to {New York Gov. Mario} Cuomo," Mr. Warren warns (the state lottery and high milk prices are the issues).
Frank Perdue is in trouble, too ("Chicken is $1.29 a pound, a year ago it was 79 cents").

   Mr. Warren has noticed that the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan didn't get built, despite huge outlays of funds.
"The only hole in the ground we got is a pothole," he says.

   "The underdog in me comes out," proclaims Mr. Warren.
"Let's fight back."
A recent target was the banking system.
When Mr. Warren's record began to sell, his little company, with headquarters in his apartment, had some trouble collecting credit-card revenues accumulating in banks because he wasn't registered as a legitimate retailer.

   "Isn't that insanity?" he fumes.
"The banks don't want the little guy anymore.
They want Brazil and Argentina, who will bankrupt them."
But then the matter was resolved, and Mr. Warren, typically, forgot about his ire at the banks.

   Rodney Publications, Mr. Warren's company, is named after his Old English sheepdog, who died some years ago and is memorialized in photographs around the apartment.
Although Mr. Warren got various kinds of professional assistance in putting out "Insanity" (Mitch Miller, for instance, was the producer and provided some seed money for the project), the record in many ways is a one-man project.

   "I did the editing, the cutting," recalls Mr. Warren.
"I was the messenger boy.
I brought it in for $12,000.
Nobody ever heard of such a thing.
If Columbia had done it, it would have cost $150,000."
That was for 3,000 albums and 2,500 tape cassettes.
Because of the "Today Show" and other publicity, an additional 10,000 are being produced now.

   On the "Today Show," Mr. Warren expressed gratitude for living in a country where he can "speak my mind and not be sent to Gulag."
And he says, "If you can make people laugh, it's the best medicine in the world.
Life is too short to cry."

   Otis Blackwell stumbled into a
songwriting career and ended up composing hit records that have sold
a remarkable 185 million copies.
   In more than 30 years of writing, he says he's used no guidelines
in turning out such rock 'n' roll hits as ``Handy Man,'' ``Don't Be
Cruel,'' ``Return to Sender'' and ``All Shook Up.''
   ``I wrote, went home and prayed,'' he said about his early years
as a songwriter when he composed several hit records for Elvis
Presley and ``Great Balls of Fire'' and ``Breathless'' for Jerry Lee
Lewis.
   He's written more than 1,000 songs that have been recorded by
performers such as Billy Joel, James Taylor, Ray Charles, the Who,
Otis Redding, Peggy Lee and dozens of others in addition to Presley
and Lewis.
   ``It makes me feel wonderful for other people to do my songs and
have them still be around and have people still wanting to do
them,'' Blackwell says, reflecting on a composing career few can
match.
   His favorite?
   ``I don't know. I have fun with all of them.''
   The 56-year-old Blackwell was a poor kid from Brooklyn, N.Y., who
wanted to be a singer. He worked as a young man as a floor sweeper
at a Brooklyn theater and later as a clothes presser. While
recording tunes for a small New York company, he was asked to write
songs as well.
   ``I was thrown into it,'' he says about songwriting.
   His songs in the years since have sold 185 million copies, with
Presley's ``Don't Be Cruel'' one of his first hits. Cheap Trick
recently had another hit version.
   ``I guess the style was different,'' he says about Presley's
version. ``Elvis came out with it and it was new and he was new.''
   About the Cheap Trick version, he says, ``I loved it. It was done
close to the way it was done the first time. I was surprised it was
so close. The performance they did was superb.''
   Another big seller was ``Handy Man,'' a hit most recently for
Taylor but a song written and recorded years earlier. ``It was out a
few weeks before I heard it,'' Blackwell says. ``I didn't even know
who James Taylor was. It was a little different. I had no idea it
would catch on the way it did.''
   He wrote ``Return to Sender'' hoping it would be included in a
movie Presley would make.
   ``It wasn't the same type of shuffle songs we used to do,''
Blackwell recalled. ``I really didn't think he would accept it. It
was different compared to the type songs we had been pitching at
him.''
   Blackwell often sang the songs himself before they were recorded,
and some music historians believe his style influenced Presley's.
   ``I don't know except that we both sound alike,'' Blackwell says.
``I used to do quite a few demos (demonstration versions) of songs I
didn't write ... songs that were his style. It was easy writing for
him. When I would do these things, I would figure this is me singing
and this is the way he would sing them. So it came real easy.''
   He never met Presley and feels his relationship with him was best
kept at a distance: ``We hadecord company and may put a band
together and perform the songs he's written.
   ``I enjoy singing the songs I've written because the people I
perform for know the songs and like to sing along with me,'' he says.
   He offers few suggestions for writing songs.
   ``What I find out is you've just got to get up and whatever
comes, I just throw the book away, whatever that is. I don't have
any guidelines. I try to write simple lyrics. I try to write clear
lyrics. My lyrics must be simple and can be sung by kids 5-years-old
on up. I just try to figure out something not done before.
   ``I made a lot of money and still do,'' he said. ``I've spent a
lot foolishly. I had my problems with the big house and big car and
the good times and the government and I guess I had an alcohol
problem at one time.
   ``The wealth I have is knowing that my songs are still being done
and I've helped a lot of writers whenever possible.''

<TEXT>
   Irving Berlin once insisted there were nine
rules to writing popular songs.
   They must be original, easy to sing, easy to remember,
``sexless'' so that a man or woman could perform them and should
have attention-getting titles. But most important, Berlin stated,
``The song writer must look upon his work as a business, that is,
to make a success of it, he must work and work, and then WORK.''
   And he meant it. American music, it seems, was created on a
thousand restless nights by a shy little man with a high voice who
insisted, ``I sweat blood between 3 and 6 many mornings, and when
the drops that fall off my forehead hit the paper they're notes.''
   He liked to write in the evening, sleep in the morning and pitch
songs in the afternoon; sometimes he didn't bother sleeping.
   On a winter's night in 1941, Berlin began working on ``White
Christmas.'' He finished it the next morning and raced over to his
office, telling his stunned transcriber that ``not only is it the
best song I ever wrote, it's the best song anybody ever wrote.''
   Berlin always seemed to have a plan. In 1909, he set himself a
goal of writing four to five songs a night, creating an enormous
backlog of unused or ``trunk songs'' _ ``God Bless America'' among
them.
   Nearly 80 years later, Steven Spielberg tried to negotiate for
film rights to the great love song ``Always,'' but the director was
curtly informed that Berlin wanted to use it for a project _ never
started _ of his own. The movie, also called ``Always,'' was
released in December 1989, three months after the songwriter's
death at age 101.
   What kept him going? According to Laurence Bergreen, author of
the comprehensive biography ``As Thousands Cheer: The Life of
Irving Berlin'' ($24.95, Viking), it wasn't love or greed or even
artistic ambition. The sound of applause, the need for the public's
approval was the songwriter's greatest inspiration, the author said.
   ``He began by singing for pennies and nickels in the sidewalks
of New York,'' explained Bergreen, also author of ``James Agee: A
Life.''
   ``If people liked what he sang they gave him money and if they
didn't like it, they didn't give him money and he didn't eat.
   ``You wrote songs. They were performed, and the audience heard
it. You would stay up all night and fix it to and try to make it
better. That's how you developed, with the immediate feedback.''
   Bergreen raises the same question again and again: How did
Berlin remain so prolific for so long? How did he change with the
times for nearly 40 years until another self-made man named Elvis
Presley redefined popular music and pushed a frustrated Berlin into
retirement?
   ``He was totally market driven,'' Bergreen said. ``I think
what's remarkable is that every 10 years or so he tried to reinvent
himself as a songwriter; popular songwriters then tended to come
and go as quickly as they do now.
   ``He consciously adapted himself to changing styles. Ragtime in
the 'teens (`Alexander's Ragtime Band') to sob songs in the '20s
(`Always') to romantic ballads (`Cheek to Cheek') in the '30s. In
the '40s, you notice a pronounced influence of swing music (`I Got
the Sun in the Morning').''
   Irving Berlin was born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, the son of
a Russian cantor and one of eight children. His family emigrated to
the United States in 1893 and settled into the heavily populated
Jewish community of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
   While his parents and siblings stuck to the ways of the old
country, even speaking in Yiddish, Berlin raced into the new world,
hustling to get out of his family's cramped, dirty tenement as
quickly as possible and make it to the classy world that waited
uptown.
   He hawked newspapers, spoke in colorful New York slang, earned
coins as a singing waiter. Eventually, he changed his name and
tried writing his own songs, reasoning, ``Once you start singing,
you start thinking of writing songs, it's as simple as that.''
   He wrote his first song, ``Marie From Sunny Italy,'' in 1908 and
soon joined a music publishing house called Waterson &amp; Snyder. In
1911, Berlin contributed four songs to the Ziegfield Follies, and
hammered out ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' a lively update of the
``classic'' ragtime made popular by Scott Joplin in 1899.
   Like any quick-thinking kid, Berlin was looking for an angle, a
gimmick _ some way to grab onto a trend _ and seized on ragtime as
the answer. But he was also willing to take chances, play with the
rules and invent the rules.
   ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' the name inspired by the
derogatorially named ``coon'' songs that had ``Alexander'' in the
title, combined popular black and white music, mixing ragtime and
march. The chorus ran 32 bars, double the usual length, and the
song changed key in mid-course, another innovation.
   ``I humbly began to study my own song, asking myself, `Why?'
`Why?','' Berlin recalled in 1915, reflecting on its international
success.
   ``And I got an answer. ... It's opening words, emphasized by
immediate repitition _ `Come on and hear! Come on and hear!' _ were
an invitation to `come' and join in, and `hear' the singer and his
song.''
   ``There were distinctive yard marks in his songs that you could
see,'' Bergreen said. ```Puttin' on the Ritz' on the one hand and
`God Bless America' as the other. You had anthems of basic American
events: `White Christmas,' `Easter Parade'; ragtime songs like
`Alexander's Ragtime Band.'
   ``And there was the counterpoint song, `Just in Love,' `Play a
Simple Melody,' `An Old Fashioned Wedding.' There were two songs
kind of going at the same time, two singers singing against each
other.''
   Berlin could neither read nor write music and his business
skills were equally crude, equally effective. He had dropped out of
school at age 14 to earn money and had to scramble around town,
pitching his songs to publishers; until his death in 1989, his
office never had a computer.
   But if Berlin sweated blood as a businessman, the drops that
fell quickly turned to cash. He realized early on that publishing
was where the most money could be made and held on stubbornly to
the rights of his songs, boasting for years that he received the
highest royalty payments in the nation.

WE HARDLY KNOW; -- Murry Frymer; THE man wrote such songs as "42nd Street" and
"Lullabye of Broadway" and "September in the Rain." But unlike many other
songwriters of his time, his name never did become a household word.;    Which
is why a revue of songs that Harry Warren wrote is titled "Harry Who?" It

this week and plans an open run.;    The show was first in production at the
Hillbarn Theater in Foster City last summer, directed by Ronnie Klein. Klein
is also the director of another San Francisco revue, "Party of One," which has
managed a five-year run at various venues in San Francisco and is about to
open in Vancouver, B.C.;    Harry Warren, who won three Academy Awards and
claimed more "Hit Parade" songs in his time than Irving Berlin, died in 1981.

group sold out its traditional set of shows at the Oakland Coliseum during New
Year's week and did the same more recently at the same venue. And Jerry Garcia
and various collaborators of the group have played to sold-out crowds at other
shows in between.;    Now the Jerry Garcia Band is back for another set of
shows at the Warfield Theater, 982 Market St., San Francisco. The band opened
Wednesday, and they'll continue with shows tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m.

   Give Kenny Loggins a movie and he'll give you a
hit tune.
   Since splitting with partner Jim Messina in 1976 so both could
pursue solo careers, Loggins has found success in songs for movies.
   He's touted by Columbia Records publicity as ``the only male
solo artist to have achieved three Top 10 singles from three
different films.''
   The songs are ``I'm Alright'' from ``Caddyshack'' in 1980; the
title song of ``Footloose'' in 1984; and ``Danger Zone'' from ``Top
Gun'' in 1986.
   His new single, ``Nobody's Fool,'' from ``Caddyshack II,'' is in
the Top 40 and heading toward becoming his fourth Top 10 from a
film. Loggins' new album, ``Back to Avalon'' is his first in three
years.
   Loggins talked about his new album and career in an interview
before beginning an American tour which will keep him on the road
through Oct. 9.
   Here are highlights of that interview.
   Q. Why is ``Back to Avalon'' your first solo album in three
years?
   A. I was asking myself that the other day. I guess time just
sort of swept by. I wrote and recorded more songs for this album
than the 10 or 11 I normally do. I recorded 16 or 17.
   I had a third child, a little girl, 8 months old, whose brothers
are 7 and 6. We've been building a home in Santa Barbara (Calif.).
For those who've built homes, they know that can be consuming.
   And during that period I had two soundtrack songs, ``Meet Me
Half Way'' in ``Over the Top'' and ``Danger Zone'' in ``Top Gun.''
   Q. Is ``Back to Avalon'' about Catalina Island?
   A. No. Avalon's a mythical place which has to do with King
Arthur's Court. The song isn't about King Arthur's Court. It's
about a relationship that has been together awhile and started to
drift apart. The singer refers to the way love used to be as
Avalon. They've got one last try to regain that feel of Avalon.
   Q. Do they?
   A. I have no idea. It's as if it was a scene of a movie. You
only get to see the one scene; you don't get to see the resolution.
   Quite often I get a visual idea and what I try to do is describe
the scene and the emotion behind the scene, which is probably why I
enjoy doing the soundtrack thing so much. They deliver up a scene
for me and I try to find the emotion behind the scene and write the
song to it.
   Q. Have you always written that way?
   A. Yes. There's always a moment in time that you freeze and you
try to describe best that single emotion in that single moment.
   Q. What has been your most successful ``emotion behind a scene''
song?
   A. Possibly ``Forever,'' a hit of mine a couple of years ago. Or
``Back to Avalon.'' I like to think my writing gets better as I get
older.
   Q. Are there disadvantages to being identified with movie songs?
   A. I don't think there is any stigma to singing movie songs. The
only thing I would worry about would be that radio would say,
``We're not going to play this any more.'' So far they're behind
me. That's all that matters. I figure as long as it's a good song
they'll play it.
   I don't think I've compromised my writing to do it. I've been
very fortunate that I've had such luck with it.
   Q. Can a hit song only come from a hit movie?
   A. I had a hit record, ``Meet Me Half Way,'' from a dog movie,
Sly Stallone's ``Over the Top.''
   Q. Have you had any movie songs that didn't work out?
   A. I told the two guys doing ``Flashdance'' that I didn't have
time to write and record for it; I was on the road. Within a few
days of being on the road I fell off a stage in Utah and broke a
couple of ribs. I was sent home. During the recuperation, I tried
to put together a song for ``Flashdance.'' They liked it. I felt it
wasn't good enough and I pulled it, not realizing the movie was
going to be one of the biggest summer movies in history.
   Q. Does your success with movie songs bring you lots of offers?
   A. I expected, once you had a few hits, they'd come looking for
you. But for the most part you have to search them out. When I hear
about a project that has got a buzz on it, I'll have my manager
make some calls and see if they're interested in music and if I can
get in to see a screening.
   Q. How did you start with movie songs?
   A. I wrote ``I Believe in Love,'' which Barbra Streisand sang in
``A Star Is Born,'' and met Jon Peters (Streisand's former
companion), who was producing. Jon called me for ``Caddyshack.''
They needed a theme song. I watched a rough cut, laughed a lot and
wanted to be a part of it. Within a couple of days I'd written
``I'm Alright.''
   But I wasn't so sure when he called about ``Caddyshack II.'' I
was a little skittish about trusting lightning to strike twice in
the same place.
   Q. Have you written all the movie songs you've recorded?
   A. ``Danger Zone'' and ``Meet Me Half Way'' were both written by
Georgio Moroder. The ``Footloose'' script was written by a friend
of mine, lyricist Dean Pitchford. We wrote ``Footloose'' and ``I'm
Free'' together, which were in the movie. He went on to collaborate
on all the songs in the movie.
   Q. What were your thoughts when you turned 40 this year?
   A. You mean about suicide? I was a little depressed for a few
days. When you're in rock 'n' roll you don't expect to turn 40.

   When the punk rock band ``Old Skull'' began
performing at local clubs, J.P. Toulon's hands were only big enough
to play three chords on the guitar, and the group got paid with
McDonald's happy meals.
   Today, the three prepubescent punksters have a music video on
MTV for their debut LP, ``Get Outta School,'' and practice in
J.P.'s basement on high-tech equipment donated by sponsors. They
even were paid $1,000 for a 30-minute performance in New York.
   ``Old Skull'' _ guitarist J.P. Toulon, 10; his brother, bass
player Jamie, 9, and drummer Jesse Collins-Davies, 10 _ has been
together for three years. The trio is managed by J.P.'s father,
Vern. ``Get Outta School,'' which was recorded more than a year ago
and released last spring, has sold about 30,000 copies.
   ``People will buy your first album because you're young and new
and they think, `Oh, how cute,''' said Jesse, a fifth-grader. ``But
now they want to hear real music and that's what we're trying to
do. Our last record _ we just played anything.''
   On the first album, the band sings, and screams, about such
issues as the homeless and AIDS. In ``Homeless,'' J.P. howls into
the microphone amid screeching guitars and bashing drums.
   ``I hate you Ronald Reagan!'' he shouts at the end, with a look
in his eye that tells you he means it.
   ``Reagan's out, dude,'' Robin Davies, Jesse's father, said at a
recent after-school practice.
   ``I know,'' J.P. responded. ``I still hate him.''
   The band performs fun, silly songs, too.
   ``Hotdog Hell'' gives the audience more than just music for slam
dancing, a popular form of dancing for punk rock enthusiasts.
   ``It's usually our last song,'' said Jamie, a fourth-grader.
``We throw hot dogs into the crowd. It's funny. Then they throw
them back at us and we fight back _ we throw them back again.''
   But the band has gained more popularity on the East and West
coasts than at home in Madison, Davies said. ``On the coasts they
tend to get caught up in the media like L.A. and New York. In
Madison, they don't get caught up in it, which is good, actually,
for the kids. In Madison they're more grounded.''
   The band has received more than 400 fan letters from around the
world, including one from a boy in Greece.
   Both fathers, who also are musicians, insist their children are
treated just like other students at school and have not been
changed by their success.
   ``I know it's crazy, but things are absolutely the same,''
Toulon said. ``If anything, they're sick of it (media attention).
There's been no grown heads.''
   Amid school, soccer, karate and skateboarding, the boys practice
weekly and travel about one weekend a month to Minneapolis,
Milwaukee, Chicago and other nearby cities. They usually play in
bars or nightclubs. The band will make its first international
appearance when the boys, along with their parents, go to Japan to
appear on an audience-participation television show Dec. 8.
   Despite some criticism for allowing their children to play in a
punk band, the fathers said they believe ``Old Skull'' is a
positive aspect in their sons' lives.
   ``It's really opened a lot of doors for J.P.,'' Toulon said.
Although he's never acted before, J.P. has auditioned for the lead
role in ``Motorama,'' an action film from the producers of
``Platoon.''
   J.P. and Jesse also write most of the band's songs.
   ``We write about what we see and feel,'' Jesse said. ``We write
about what we think is important.''
   ``We're trying to be more serious than we are,'' said J.P., a
fifth-grader. ``But it's hard, because we're only kids.''
   What timely topics can we expect ``Old Skull'' to be shrieking
criticism at on the next album?
   ``I wrote a song about the stealth bomber,'' Jesse said. ``It's
called Money Waste.''

<BYLINE>To Recall Beatles Lyrics, Love Is Not All You Need
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You think you know your favorite Beatles songs,
right? But can you remember all the lyrics, and can you get all the
correct words in the correct places? Psychologists want to know.
   For example, in the song ``Rocky Raccoon,'' what comes after the
opening line: ``Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of
Dakota''? (Answer: The second line is, ``There lived a young boy
named Rocky Raccoon.'')
   Researchers asked 76 Duke University students to recall and
write down all the words to 32 Beatles songs. They were given only
the title and the first line of each.
   The purpose was to gain insight into how the mind remembers, say
researchers David Rubin of Duke and Ira Hyman of Emory University
in Atlanta.
   Half the students were assigned one group of 32 randomly chosen
songs; the others were given a different group of 32 tunes.
   Researchers analyzed the students' performance on the 25
best-remembered songs. Multiplying the number of lines in those
songs times the 38 students assigned each song gave a maximum
possible score of 16,416 recollections.
   The students achieved only 3,378 with any degree of accuracy.
   But the interesting thing, Hyman said Sunday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association, is that recall
for details of the lines they remembered was remarkably good.
   Of the 3,378 lines students wrote down, they recalled 2,371
without error, 454 more with only one error and 227 with only two
errors.
   And even the flawed lines generally followed the meaning, rhythm
and poetic features of the original, suggesting people use those
characteristics to recall such material, Hyman said.
   For example, rhythm and rhyme were preserved in such errors as
remembering the phrase ``and you know you should be glad'' as ``and
you know you can't be sad,'' from the hit ``She Loves You.''
   Only four of 32 students in one group remembered that Rocky
Raccoon was carrying a gun to ``shoot off the legs of his rival.''
But some guesses were close, such as to shoot off the head or hands
or ``shoot out the lights'' of the man who stole his woman.
   Rhyming words at the end of lines were well recalled, but
sometimes there was some unintentional editing. One student turned
``wonder how you manage to feed the rest'' from ``Lady Madonna''
into ``wonder how you manage to be caressed.''
   Sometimes a flubbed phrase didn't even rhyme with the original.
``Having read the book'' from the song ``A Day in the Life'' became
``having read the play'' in one student's version.
   Other errors kept the same sounds within lines, as when the
phrase ``always know sometimes think it's me,'' from ``Strawberry
Fields Forever,'' became ``always though sometimes think it's
free.''
   In another case, from ``Yesterday,'' the line ``I said something
wrong now I long for yesterday'' became ``I must move along but I
long for yesterday.''
   And as for the student who wrote ``for efficient finger pies''
while trying to recall ``a four of fish and finger pies'' from the
song ``Penny Lane,'' maybe he just never heard it right in the
first place.

   Irving Berlin, the Russian cantor's son whose
songs such as ``Cheek to Cheek,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``White
Christmas'' and ``God Bless America'' became the essence of American
music, has died at age 101.
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
   Of Berlin's music, Gould said: ``It's become part of our
language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul.
   ``It's the kind of finish of an era.''
   Berlin died in his sleep at his Manhattan town house Friday
afternoon, said his son-in-law, Alton E. Peters. Asked if Berlin had
been ill, Peters said, ``No, he was 101 years old. ... He just fell
asleep.''
   An actor, singer, and songwriter, Berlin began his career in the
early days of vaudeville and his songs for a time so dominated the
stage and screen that the late composer, Jerome Kern, said: ``Berlin
has no place in American music. He is American music.''
   In a musical career that began with a job as a singing waiter,
Berlin wrote nearly 1,000 songs, from his first big hit,
``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1911, to ``Puttin' on the Ritz,''
which was revived in 1983 by the Dutch singer Taco and was a hit on
the rock charts.
   Berlin was an immigrant Russian whose ``God Bless America''
became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. A Jew, his
``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade'' became Christian holiday
traditions.
   ``American music was born at his piano,'' violinist Isaac Stern
said on Berlin's 100th birthday.
   So timeless was his appeal that his songs have become hits over
and over, performed by such artists as Frank Sinatra, Barbra
Streisand and Diana Ross. ASCAP records show 25 of his songs have
topped the popular music charts.
   ``Blue Skies,'' a top hit when he penned it in 1926, reached the
charts again 51 years later on an album by country singer Willie
Nelson.
   Berlin played the piano by ear and never stopped making what he
described as ``songs with heart.'' Even in his 90s, he talked of
adding yet another musical to his credits, which included 19 stage
musicals and 15 movie scores.
   At his peak, one smash followed another so readily that Cole
Porter once said Berlin ``can't help but write hits.''
   Berlin, along with 11 other American immigrants, received a medal
from President Reagan during the Statue of Liberty centennial
celebrations in July 1986.
   Reagan the actor was featured in the mammoth, flag-waving 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' with songs from Berlin.
   ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully
talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions,
and will live on forever,'' Reagan said.
   Always a private man, Berlin declined to attend a Carnegie Hall
gala, led by Sinatra and Leonard Bernstein, to mark his 100th
birthday on May 11, 1988.
   He was mourned by artists from across the spectrum of American
music.
   ``Irving Berlin was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter,'' said
opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's songs. ``He was
not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote the 1969 Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music.''
   ``One could hear the dancing by just singing the lyrics,''
cabaret singer Bobby Short said. ``He is perhaps the last of the
giants _ and I think that's not a bad way to go.''
   Actress and dancer Ginger Rogers remembered Berlin with a bit of
song from his ``Cheek to Cheek,'' from the movie ``Top Hat.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang, then broke off. ``It was like
heaven,'' she said, describing the thrill of working with the likes
of Berlin and Fred Astaire.
   The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes,
which began in the World War I era with ``Watch Your Step,''
starring Irene and Vernon Castle, and ran through such post-World
War II hits as ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam,'' both
with Ethel Merman.
   ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many Berlin wrote for
the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every
Ziegfeld extravaganza.
   In Hollywood, Berlin did the scores of ``Top Hat,'' starring
Astaire and Miss Rogers; ``Holiday Inn'' with Astaire and Bing
Crosby; ``Blue Skies''; ``Easter Parade''; ``White Christmas''; and
``There's No Business Like Show Business.''
   His last Broadway show was ``Mr. President'' in 1962. His last
song, ``An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966.
   His music-publishing empire earned him a fortune, which he
readily shared with his country in wartime or with favorite causes.
Since 1939 the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America have been
getting the royalties from ``God Bless America.''
   Berlin was awarded three medals for his works and a special Tony
award for his contribution to the musical theater. He won a
congressional medal for the acclaimed World War II musical, ``This
is the Army,'' and the Academy Award for best song of 1942 for
``White Christmas.''
   Explaining the seemingly endless gusher of successful songs,
Berlin said his tunes were merely rewrites of a handful of his best
numbers. ``All good songwriters have no more than half a dozen good
tunes in their systems, and if they have that many they're liberally
blessed,'' he once said.
   Berlin never learned to read or write music and his piano playing
was confined to the key of F sharp. He called songwriting hard work,
but director Josh Logan once recalled that Berlin dashed off the
first verse of ``Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better'' during a
six-minute cab ride.
   Celebrity and wealth didn't seem to touch the shy personality of
the intense, short man with wavy, slicked-down hair and dark
glasses. He lived a simple life, centered on his songwriting and his
family _ his late wife, Ellin, and their three daughters.
   Berlin was brought up in poverty amid the immigrant swarm on
Manhattan's Lower East Side. Born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, he
was 5 when his family emigrated from Temun in eastern Russia. He was
one of eight children and acquired his earliest musical education
from his father, a cantor. But his father's death put an end to
Berlin's formal education and, at age 8, he went from the second
grade to the streets to earn a living.
   Known as Izzy, Berlin sold newspapers, guided a blind, singing
beggar and worked in vaudeville. In 1907, he wrote the words to his
first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy'' in collaboration with the piano
player at the Chinatown bar where he worked as a singing waiter.
   The song earned him 37 cents in royalties and a new name _ the
sheet music cover erroneously credited the words to ``I. Berlin.''
   In 1911, at the age of 23, he was contributing songs to the
Ziegfeld Follies. His ``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' with its ``ragged
meter'' ushered jazz onto the popular scene and established Berlin
as a master of Tin Pan Alley.
   Berlin's marriage to Dorothy Goetz the following year ended after
six months when his bride died of typhoid contracted during their
honeymoon in Havana. In his grief, Berlin composed ``When I Lost
You.''
   His marriage in 1926 to Ellin Mackay followed one of the most
widely reported courtships of the decade. His wife's father, a
prominent Roman Catholic layman and head of Postal Telegraph Co.,
had opposed the union.
   Berlin's wife died of a stroke at age 85 in July 1988. Berlin is
survived by his three daughters, Mary Ellin, Linda and Elizabeth.
   Services will be private, said Bill Hartgrove, evening manager at
the Frank Campbell funeral home in Manhattan.

   Combine a mail deliverer, a dishwasher, a tour
guide and a certified driller of bowling balls and you have
``Katrina and the Waves,'' not the average rock 'n' roll band.
   Take the name, for instance. Former postal worker Kimberly Rew
is the acknowledged leader, the band's principal writer and
arranger. So who gets top billing? Singer and ex-dishwasher Katrina
Leskanich, of course.
   ``At first Kimberly was doing the singing and the group was
called `The Waves,''' explained drummer Alex Cooper, the band's
one-time tour guide. ``But once Katrina started singing, we became
`Katrina and the Waves.' Someone said we'd get more dates at the
military camps because the soldiers will come out for a girl's
name.''
   Military camps are important because both Cooper and Leskanich
grew up in military families that traveled all over the world.
Leskanich alone has lived in England, Germany, the Netherlands,
Nebraska, Massachusetts, California, Georgia and Kansas.
   The group's first live performances were at military bases,
before crowds that responded to a singer called Katrina.
   ``We used to play on these horrible naval bases up in Scotland
where these guys had in been submarines for six months and I was
the first female they'd seen,'' Leskanich said.
   ``They'd go absolutely wild, they were up to here in liquor.
They'd pull down their pants right on the dance floor. We just
collapsed laughing, it was all a joke. We're trying to do our
number and it was just ridiculous.''
   In 1981, Rew wrote ``Walking on Sunshine,'' a good old-fashioned
rock 'n' roll summer song _ bouncy melody, memorable guitar riffs
and Katrina's joyous vocals on top. It sounded like a sure hit, and
was: four years later.
   ``We took it around to all the stations and all the companies,
and nothing happened,'' Cooper said. ``Then we were signed at the
end of '84 to Capitol and at the end of '85 they put it out, pow! A
classic! It was released at the right time, just one of those
things.''
   After finally cracking the charts, Katrina and the Waves could
be expected to get right to work on a new album. They did, but the
record didn't come out until recently.
   ``We thought we had finished the record,'' Cooper said. ``But we
took it back home and listened to it, and said: `Oh dear. I think
we'll start again.' We did that twice.''
   The Waves consider their group a democracy; whoever shouts
loudest wins. Nothing is considered finished until everyone is
satisfied, and with four very distinct personalities, that can take
time.
   ``Alex is dad. I'd sit home all the time if I could. `C'mon,'
he'll say, `let's get on the bus,''' said bassist and bowling ball
surgeon Vince de la Cruz. ``Kim is the mad professor. Katrina is
chief brat. I just try to do as little as possible.''
   The band agrees that Katrina's voice and Kimberly's guitar and
songwriting are the key to their sound. But since Katrina won't
sing anything that doesn't feel right, ``creative differences'' can
emerge.
   ``Kim's songs are brilliant and he's still going to write songs
on his own that the band's not going to touch,'' Katrina said.
``But he's trying to write songs from my point of view and
sometimes I didn't agree.''
   She cited ``Crush on You,'' a ballad off the new album.
   ``At first, I thought it was a little too boy-meets-girl. That's
a good example of one of Kim's `boy-meets-girl' songs I tried to
change but when I did, it lost the innocence.
   ``I have to sing a song from my point of view. I feel it's going
to be believed. But when you are trying to write from someone
else's point of view, you start getting into cliches.''
   While all due admiration for Rew, the fellow Waves have started
contributing their own material.
   Katrina and Kim co-wrote ``To Have and to Hold'' and ``Love
Calculator.'' Kim and Alex share credits on ``Rock Myself to
Sleep,'' and the whole band contributed to ``Chain Lover,'' ``Rock
'n' Roll Girls'' and the hit single ``Break of Hearts.''
   ``We've only started doing that in the last six months,'' Cooper
said. ``Kimberly tended to always just come to us with songs, but
he suggested himself after about eight years that we should
contribute. It's taken us eight years to get confident enough to
work on our own ideas.''
   Sharing material has helped keep the band together; so has
separating their private lives.
   ``You live a very tense existence,'' Cooper said, ``but we all
have interests outside the band that are not musical and not
similar to each other's interests.
   ``Kimberly's happy to be working 24 hours a day, seven days a
week on music. It's a complete obsession. We love music, too, but
not with that kind of intensity.''
