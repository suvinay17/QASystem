<HEAD>Joan Lunden Celebrates Tenth ``Good Morning America'' Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With some modest fanfare, Joan Lunden today
celebrates her 10th anniversary as co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' This makes her somewhat extraordinary _ lasting in a job
that is a people-eater.
   ``I have to say I'm surprised that I'm sitting here, being the
person who has the most tenure on the morning shows,'' she says,
referring to those in the co-host and co-anchor business.
   ``It seems like it was just yesterday that I was the new kid on
the block.''
   Her time on active dawn duty goes against tradition. Network
morning show stars tend to be television's wandering tribe, often
moving on because of their own decisions, management anxiety, or
both.
   Within the last 12 months, six other such stars have left or
found new homes, notably Jane Pauley.
   Succeeded by Deborah Norville as part of the controversial
changes that sent once top-rated ``Today'' skidding into second,
Pauley is doing well in with prime time NBC News specials after 13
``Today'' years.
   ``Today'' news anchor John Palmer, an NBC News veteran, got
moved out in that show's shuffle. He left NBC and now has a
syndicated series. Faith Daniels left the ``CBS Morning News'' and
now has Palmer's old NBC job.
   Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This Morning'' got the gate, and now
is pondering her next move. She was succeeded by Paula Zahn, who
left ABC's ``World News This Morning.''
   And new mother Maria Shriver left NBC's ``Sunday Today'' to have
more family time, although she remains with NBC News.
   But Lunden _ who is only the third female co-host ``Good Morning
America'' has had since it began in November 1975 _ has stayed put.
   Married to television producer Michael Krauss, she's even
managed to have three kids during her time on the program.
   Lunden, who turns 40 next month and this summer signed a new
five-year contract with ABC, says she hasn't had any desire to
leave ``Good Morning America.'' But then, her life on the show has
been relatively serene.
   And her show, unlike ``Today'' and the shows that represent CBS'
many years of efforts to make ratings in the morning, hasn't had
the public turmoil of the kind that last year made ``Today'' a
daily two-hour soap opera.
   Lunden, a ceaselessly cheery woman better known for warmth than
penetrating interviews, hasn't even had a good headline-making
incident, like Sullivan's off-air jabs at CBS management that made
their way into print last year.
   The best Lunden has been able to stir up was a pre-emptive
on-air strike this summer. She told viewers that reporters from the
tabloid National Enquirer had been poking into her life, asking
friends if she'd seemed troubled lately.
   Why she bothered was a bit puzzling. In any event, the editor of
the paper said the queries hadn't turned up anything. Oh well, the
nation said, and life went on.
   Actor David Hartman, who hosted ``Good Morning America'' from
the start until newsman Charles Gibson succeeded him in January
1987, was an avuncular man on the air.
   But off-camera, he was said to be a tough, demanding man, one
who wanted it known the show's focus was on him, not his co-host.
   Despite that, Lunden, who first worked for the show as a
consumer reporter in 1976, said she got along fine with Hartman,
``because I just made sure that things (between them) stayed nice
all the time.
   ``I'm not saying that I wasn't very frustrated many times with
the real tight restrictions that were put on my abilities to do
stories and expand my job. But I didn't allow that to become an
issue with David and me.
   ``Because I knew very clearly that if that happened and that
relationship went, everything else was a moot point, I was gone, I
was out of there.''
   While Hartman was the host, ``Good Morning America'' had a good
run as first in ratings. But it started slipping toward the end of
his stay, and generally stayed in second until coming on strong
last year in the wake of the ``Today'' debacle.
   It has been first for 33 consecutive weeks. But during its long
stay in second, Lunden said, those on the show didn't get a lot of
pressure from ABC brass, or those of Capital Cities, the network's
new owners.
   ``They really just said, `Hey, go out there, enjoy it, be
curious, and have a good time, '' she said. ``They said, `If it
works, the ratings will go up.' And they did.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   REASON NO. 398 TO CONTINUE BREATHING: Remember the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles? Well, CBS feels it is not enough just to
start a Saturday morning cartoon series with them on Sept. 15. It
now also says it will have a ``sneak preview'' of the one-hour
series for kids on Sept. 8, and include in the show a
save-the-environment segment called ``Turtle Tips.''

<HEAD>`Good Morning America' Turns 15 Years Old Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a little before 7 a.m. and weatherman
Spencer Christian gestures at the bright blue backdrop while the
magic of television cooks up the maps and graphics you see at home.
   ``Good Morning America,'' which celebrates its 15th birthday
Friday, is about to go onto the air. Christian is doing the weather
wrapup for ABC's early morning news, which originates in another
studio.
   If you don't get into live TV studios very often, the surreal
aspects of a grown man gesturing at a blank wall are quite droll.
If you don't get up that early, it's not funny. It's not funny at
all.
   ``You never get over the adversity of sleep deprivation,'' he
tells a bleary-eyed visitor, smiling broadly. ``Imagine getting up
every morning at 3:45 a.m., no matter what you've done the night
before.''
   Maybe it would make you gesture at blank walls, eh?
   Since Nov. 2, 1975, ``GMA'' has originated from the soothing
dimness of ABC's cavernous Television Studio Number Two off Central
Park on Manhattan's lower Upper West Side.
   The show, with host David Hartman and co-host Nancy Dussault,
was designed by ABC's entertainment division as a lighter,
feature-driven competitor for NBC News' aging ``Today'' show, which
had been on the air since Jan. 14, 1952.
   The new show beat ``Today'' in the ratings, but ``Today'' got
anchor Bryant Gumbel in 1982 and fought its way back on top.
Hartman, who left in 1987, is expected back on TV in 1991 with a
syndicated, weekday magazine show.
   ``Today'' was No. 1 from 1985 on, with ``GMA'' a strong second
overall, beating the NBC show in key markets and demographic
groups. By 1989, ``Today'' was fading and ``GMA'' gaining.
   Gumbel's infamous 1989 memorandum blasting other ``Today''
talent made public the show's internal strains. When executives
engineered the departure of popular and longtime co-host Jane
Pauley, ``Today'' slipped into No. 2.
   It's stayed there for 43 consecutive weeks.
   Today there's laughter and easy banter on the ``GMA'' set. Its
cocoa browns, pink pastels and blond furniture are as familiar to
some Americans as their own living rooms - and much more
comfortable at 7 a.m.
   The co-hosts settle into the tan couch before two big, low-slung
cameras, cross-angled for head-and-shoulders shots. The floor
director relays the countdown, silent for the last three seconds.
The camera's red light goes on.
   ``Good Morning, America, I'm Joan Lunden,'' she says.
   ``And I'm Charles Gibson,'' he says, and another edition of
``Good Morning America'' has begun.
   Two hours later, Gibson has interviewed White House chief of
staff John Sununu; Ms. Lunden has interviewed a Houston woman cited
for using a stadium men's room. And the final, hour-long segment of
a series on AIDS has aired.
   The showis over and Ms. Lunden, Gibson and Christian are
relaxing on the set. None of them has been with the show from the
start.
   Ms. Lunden began as a consumer reporter in 1980. Christian
joined in 1986, and Gibson took over from Hartman in 1987. With the
departure of Jane Pauley, Ms. Lunden has become the longest-serving
woman on morning television.
   ``I live here,'' she said. ``I just come down in the morning and
dust off the sofa.''
   All three acknowledge that their show's stability has
contributed to its dominance in the ratings.
   ``I think at this time period in the morning, stability and
consistency is always crucial,'' Ms. Lunden said. ``People ...
don't like change. It's that one time period of the day that you
don't have the freedom to fool around with it and change things.''
   And the easygoing amiability that emanates from them doesn't
fade when the camera goes dark. They seem genuinely to like one
another.
   ``Are we conscious of the fact that it's necessary to maintain a
harmonious relationship?'' said Gibson. ``Absolutely. Sure. You
have to sublimate your ego, which for Spencer and I is very easy,
but for Joan is very difficult.''
   Barruump-bump!
   ``You talk about moody!'' Christian pitches in. ``We never know
which Joan Lunden's going to show up! You talk about the seven
faces of Eve, how about the 15 faces of ....'' The laughter bubbles
out of them.
   It's good to be No. 1 in the morning ratings, Gibson said, but
no one assumes ``GMA'' can't get knocked out of the top slot.
   ``It'll happen,'' he said. ``People will get tired of us and
we'll move off. And hopefully we'll be as sanguine about moving in
another direction as we were about the move up.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ``HAMLET'' RETURNS TO PBS - Kevin Kline stars tonight on PBS in
William Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet, a prince of Denmark.
   It's also his debut as a director on television, in the role
that won him an Obie award when he directed himself in the title
role onstage.
   This sumptuous modern-dress TV production, is a fine piece of
work, beautifully adapted to the strengths and limitations of
television. It's dark, intimate, obsessive.
   Tune in.

Q &amp; A / JOAN LUNDEN: EARLY TO RISE, LAST TO STAY

While most of the headlines about morning talk shows have been directed at the 
likes of Jane Pauley, Deborah Norville and Kathleen Sullivan, Joan Lunden has 
quietly built up 10 years as co-host of ABC's top-rated "Good Morning America" 
(weekdays, 7-9 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Lunden joined "GMA" in 1976 as a consumer reporter. She replaced Sandy Hill as 
co-host four years later, first opposite David Hartman and for the last three 
years with Charles Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Lunden, the mother of three daughters, has become a spokeswoman for working 
mothers and has hosted two programs on parenting -- the Lifetime series 
"Mother's Day" and the syndicated "Everyday." 
</P>
<P>
She recently took on the National Enquirer on "Good Morning America" when she 
heard it was going to publish a bogus story about trouble in her marriage with 
producer Michael Krauss. "It was a scary thing to do," she says, "but I had to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lunden talked about her life as the longest-reigning co-host on early morning 
television with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations on your 10th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you. Can you believe that? The show is going to have its 15th anniversary 
in November, and when I came here to New York to be a reporter on (WABC-TV's) 
"Eyewitness News," this show had just gone on the air in its present form. I 
watched it that first year, and the following fall they came to me. That was 
one of the good things about being on the news in New York -- all the network 
executives live here. 
</P>
<P>
They said, "We want someone to keep us up to date on new products and new ideas 
and lifestyles." That was kind of up my alley. I was a consumer reporter in 
California. I started working for "Good Morning America" 14 years ago this 
September. It was something I could do while still working at "Eyewitness 
News." I did both shows for almost five years. 
</P>
<P>
When did you start hosting? 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Nancy Dussault was the hostess. When she would be away, I would 
sit in for her. They didn't have me sit in completely. They would have me come 
in and do a segment called "People in the News" and maybe an interview. 
</P>
<P>
After Sandy Hill got the job, I continued to sit in, and I started doing more 
and more reports. The first time I really sat in for her was a morning when 
they called me at home half an hour into the show. I was asleep because I 
hadn't been scheduled to be on that morning, and they said, "Are you up?" They 
said David and Sandy both have laryngitis, and it hurts to listen to them. 
Fortunately, I lived right across the street from the studio so I was there 
within 10 minutes. They quickly put some blush and makeup on me, and I was 
thrown into it. You didn't have time to get scared. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Morning America" has been No. 1 in the ratings much of the year. 
</P>
<P>
When it first came on it was like this new kid on the block, and over about a 
five-year period it built and built and built. I would attribute that to the 
program itself. It was a good format and a nice, comfortable, warm set. David 
Hartman was everyman's man. By the time I came on full-time, the program had 
been solidly No. 1 for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the end of David's tenure here that the ratings slipped. ABC's 
prime time took a nose-dive, and we are affected by what people watch at night. 
</P>
<P>
That also was a time when our society was really changing, and we (women) were 
not willing to accept the dominant male and the subservient female, and that 
was clearly how our program was set up. David Hartman was supposed to be the 
star. I think that hurt us in the end. 
</P>
<P>
It was important they chose a new person . . . not to go after a name of big 
marquee value and make them a star, but to find somebody people wouldn't find 
threatening. It's an obvious friendship between me and Charlie. What you got 
was this new team of 50-50 equal, and I think that was important. You weren't 
getting that on the other programs. We slowly built our ratings. Now they say 
it's because Jane Pauley left the "Today" show that "GMA" is winning. That's 
taken some of the personal satisfaction away from it. But we have been No. 1 
for 31 weeks, not that I am counting. 
</P>
<P>
You get up every morning at 3:30 to do the show. It must be difficult to juggle 
your work schedule and find time to be a mom and wife. 
</P>
<P>
For me as a working mom, I know by getting up at 3:30 a.m. I'm out of here at 
10 or 10:30 a.m. and can do all the things I want to for my kids. I am that 
person who can get their cake and eat it, too. There are not that many women, 
working moms, who can say they have the kind of job I do, very high-profile, 
very challenging, great responsibility, and still be a full-time mother. 
Usually those two can't mix; one has got to give. 
</P>
<P>
What have been your most memorable moments on the show? 
</P>
<P>
Flying the jet trainer (a T-34 naval flight-training plane) was definitely the 
highlight. It was so much fun. Interviewing people like Prince Charles, world 
leaders, covering the inaugurations -- those are always high points. 
</P>
<P>
Do you ever get tongue-tied while interviewing someone? 
</P>
<P>
Sure. I asked Candice Bergen the other day about her late father, Charlie 
McCarthy. She said, "That's OK. That's a mistake that has been made a million 
times." (Her father was Charlie McCarthy's puppeteer, Edgar Bergen.) You think, 
"How could I have done that?" But you read reams of research before you go in 
and there is so much on your mind.

It used to be that morning television was as comforting a way to start the day 
as a fresh cup of coffee and a hot, buttered roll. If late-night TV is what you 
watch between your toes, the network morning shows are like radio with rabbit 
ears: programs you listen to and watch between the shower and the car door -- 
for friendly banter, useful features and the reassurance that the world has 
made it through another night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the first news of the day for many people," notes Charles Gibson, "Good 
Morning America" co-anchor, "and they want to know that Cleveland is still 
there." 
</P>
<P>
They also want to know that Charles Gibson is still there, along with Joan 
Lunden -- or, if they're "Today" show fans, Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
Since morning TV began nearly 40 years ago with NBC's "Today" and host Dave 
Garroway, the collegiality of the on-air "family" has been considered a 
significant factor in a show's success. The traditional on-air marriage of 
David Hartman and Joan Lunden on "Good Morning America" might give way to the 
"Moonlighting"-style relationship of Gumbel and Pauley as the preferred format, 
but network research has found that conflict and sudden change are not what 
bleary-eyed viewers want. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to argue with my wife, I'll save it until nighttime," says Jack 
Reilly, executive producer of "Good Morning America." "That translates to 
television -- viewers don't want aggravation when they have their whole day 
ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
Well, fasten your Mr. Coffee machines -- it's going to be a bumpy morning. 
America's TV wakeup call -- already jangling with the planned departure of Jane 
Pauley from "Today" -- is likely to be in for some changes. 
</P>
<P>
NBC is expected to announce this week that Pauley will leave "Today" after 13 
years to work on a prime-time news series. She has been concerned about the 
possible direction of "Today" and the handling of the promotion of Deborah 
Norville as news anchor. Weatherman Willard Scott, meanwhile -- who was 
criticized for his cornpone ways by anchor Bryant Gumbel in a now-infamous memo 
to the executive producer -- has made no secret of his desire to leave the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
And "Today" -- which remains No. 1 in the ratings but has been losing ground to 
ABC's "Good Morning America" -- will be getting a new senior executive producer 
in January: David Nuell, the executive producer of "Entertainment Tonight." 
Nuell has helped to improve the ratings of "ET" with more tabloid-style 
features. While there is no indication that Nuell would bring "ET" to "Today," 
some network observers project that a revamp of "Today" could be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Behind all the publicity about the "Today" show, the bottom-line story of 
morning news is that ABC's "Good Morning America" has been beating "Today" with 
a key demographic group for advertisers -- women aged 18 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
A successful network show can be a cash-cow for a network and its stations; 
"Today" brings in more than $65 million a year in revenue. Being outperformed 
by ABC with a key demographic group, therefore, hurts where it counts. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the overall ratings, "GMA" has been gaining. Although "Today" remains 
No. 1, in the last year it has declined 7% in its share of the total audience, 
while "GMA" has gained 3%. The race is now so close that only two-tenths of a 
ratings point separates "GMA" from "Today," according to Nielsen ratings for 
the third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
While they're not gloating about the negative publicity at "Today," the 
producers of "GMA" are glad they don't have that problem to worry about at the 
moment. The last time there was early-morning dissent, it was over Joan 
Lunden's dissatisfaction with years of playing second-fiddle to David Hartman. 
Hartman has now left the show, replaced by ABC newsman Charles Gibson, with 
whom Lunden shares co-anchor duties. 
</P>
<P>
"GMA" has been changing some of its features to accommodate the changing 
interests of the audience, cutting back on celebrity interviews now seen on 
many other shows and adding contributors such as Terry Rohe, a 72-year-old 
reporter who talks to both parents and their grown children about issues 
concerning older people. 
</P>
<P>
According to NBC executives, NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol was given the 
additional responsibility of overseeing "Today" for the news division earlier 
this year because "Today" seemed to be lacking in fresh ideas. Noting that 
"Today" had overtaken the then-top-rated "GMA" in the mid-1980s with the 
pairing of Gumbel and Pauley, news-making trips abroad and other fresh 
approaches, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said in an interview, 
"The show needed innovation and new leadership. It seemed to be running on 
previous momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the situation said that the appointment of Deborah 
Norville last August to replace John Palmer as news anchor on "Today" was 
intended as a bid for younger viewers. The theory was that Norville, a touted 
new NBC star, would be more attractive to them than the veteran Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol is said to have explained the change to Pauley, but there seems to have 
been some misunderstanding on the full extent of Norville's role, which has 
proved to be more of a full partner with Gumbel and Pauley than simply a 
news-reader, as Palmer had been. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the arrangements, which one source describes as "more of a 
screw-up than a conscious plot," appear to have backfired on NBC. Pauley, who 
is very popular with the early-morning audience, according to NBC's own 
research, is leaving the show, probably at the end of the year. And Norville, 
who was recently signed to a $1-million contract by NBC, may bear the burden of 
being portrayed as "the other woman" in the "Today" domestic drama if, as 
expected, she is named to succeed Pauley as co-anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked CBS, meanwhile, on Monday got a new executive producer for "CBS 
This Morning" with Kathleen Sullivan and Harry Smith: Erik Sorenson, formerly 
vice president and station manager at KCBS-TV Channel 2 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, a perennial third in the morning-news race, has been lagging far behind 
"GMA and "Today" with "CBS This Morning." Sullivan, a former news anchor at 
ABC, was brought to CBS with great fanfare, but "CBS This Morning" has not 
ignited the ratings since its premiere two years ago. Sorenson has not said 
what his plans for the show are. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent remark that was overhead on an open mike, Sullivan called CBS the 
"Cheap Broadcasting System." Her lawyer, Ronald Konecky, says that the remark 
was in jest and the incident was overblown. But sources at CBS say the comment 
was not a big hit with management. Sullivan has more than a year to go on her 
contract, which is estimated at $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the network morning shows remain dominant in the 7-9 a.m. period, 
they've seen some erosion of their audience to the many new other choices 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just competing with each other now," notes "GMA"s Reilly. "There's 
cable, local morning shows and even a lot of kids' cartoons that people are 
watching at those hours. If there isn't enough audience for one of the three 
network morning shows, maybe somebody will decide to run a half-hour soap -- or 
a rock concert at 7:30 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, all three networks are doing essentially the same 
kind of show that "Today" began 40 years ago, although their serious news 
content has grown. That's probably because the format works well, and sudden 
change can be disastrous. But if somebody comes up with a new wakeup call that 
works for today's audience, whether it's news, entertainment or some new 
combination, the rewards could be very big indeed.

'TODAY' TAKES A PLUNGE AFTER PAULEY EXIT; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: DIAL-SPINNING SETS IN AS THE NBC PROGRAM LOSES ITS LEAD IN THE 
USUALLY STABLE MORNING NEWS MARKET.

<P>
In morning television, where viewing habits are as traditional as orange juice 
and coffee, the "Today" show lately has been waking up to a cold shower in the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jane Pauley departed and was replaced by Deborah Norville as co-anchor on 
the 38-year-old NBC show, "Today" has been replaced by ABC's "Good Morning 
America" as the top-rated network morning news show, with "Today" losing a 
surprising 10% of its rating in one three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, "GMA" topped a nine-week winning streak in the Nielsen ratings, 
claiming its first victory over "Today" in a February sweeps period since 
November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the month of February, one of four times a year when the ratings of every 
station in the country are measured to determine advertising rates, "Good 
Morning America's" average viewership was 4.1 million homes a day -- 
representing 21% of the audience watching TV at that time. "Today" had 3.3 
million homes and 17% of the audience. And "CBS This Morning" had 2.5 million 
homes and 12% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to February of last year, "Today's" ratings were down 22% while "GMA" 
was up 7%. CBS, the longtime third-place program, was up 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Although early-morning news programs usually lose some viewers when they change 
anchors, ratings experts say that the "Today" plunge indicates viewers are 
reacting emotionally to the soap opera that was played out on "Today" over the 
past year -- from anchor Bryant Gumbel's infamous in-house memo to NBC's 
handling of the Norville hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC tried to fix something that fundamentally wasn't broken," said Janet 
Patterson, the director of research for WBZ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Boston. 
"Morning shows are a companion to viewers. They didn't like what had happened 
to Jane Pauley, and they acted on it by voting with their TV dials." 
</P>
<P>
WBZ has been one of the most successful "Today" show stations, Patterson said, 
ranking No. 1 in the Boston market even when "Today" was No. 3 in the national 
Nielsen ratings. "Boston is a town of traditions, and people here have been 
loyal to 'Today' since the days of J. Fred Muggs," she said, referring to the 
chimp that used to be on the show when Dave Garroway was host. But in the past 
few months, "Today's" ratings in Boston have paralleled the drop in the 
national Nielsens. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the race began to heat up at about the same time as the Gumbel 
memo (about a year ago)," Patterson said. "But what clearly hurt us was 
unhappiness over Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel's memo, written in response to then-"Today" producer Marty Ryan's 
request to evaluate the elements of the show, created a barrage of publicity 
after a newspaper published it because Gumbel was particularly critical of 
another member of the show's on-air "family" -- weatherman Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
And when NBC executives, in a bid for younger viewers, hired Norville last year 
as the show's news anchor, which ultimately led to Pauley's stepping down as 
co-anchor, Norville was portrayed and perceived as a younger, blonder rival. 
</P>
<P>
Rightly or wrongly, according to CBS research, the negative publicity over 
Gumbel's memo and Norville's hiring may be washing over into viewers' 
perceptions of the "Today" co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
According to David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president of research and 
marketing, Gumbel and Norville are the only morning-news anchors who recently 
have shown "a significant negative component" in CBS' tracking of audience 
attitudes towards the morning hosts. Noting that viewers generally rank news 
anchors favorably, Poltrack said that, in the case of Gumbel and Norville, a 
number had rated them either "fair" or "poor." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' research also shows that viewers recently have been showing unusual signs 
of dial-switching among the morning shows, where "GMA" has remained stable with 
hosts Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden, while "CBS This Morning" has shown 
improvement in the ratings and has recently hired "GMA's" news anchor Paula 
Zahn to replace Kathleen Sullivan as anchor with Harry Smith. As the 
third-place entrant in the race, Poltrack said, CBS hopes to benefit from that 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
At first-place "Good Morning, America," researchers maintain that they are not 
merely benefiting from the bad publicity at "Today." Noting that "GMA" had been 
leading "Today" among young women for some time, Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior 
vice president in charge of audience research, said, "There's no question that 
Pauley's departure has had an effect, but we were in a position to take 
advantage of that opportunity. We had our personalities and segments in place 
so that people, when they came over and looked at the show, liked what they 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Barbara Walters, scheduled to air Friday on ABC's "20/20," 
Gumbel acknowledged, "We've had a series of incidents that have projected the 
show in a poor light. And we've been on top for five years. That makes you a 
very convenient target. Between the memo, the changeover of people, there's 
just been a kind of firestorm." 
</P>
<P>
Given the slow-burning nature of change in morning TV, the question for "Today" 
is how and when that firestorm will be put out. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Capra, who took over as executive producer on Jan. 29, predicts that the 
program has hit the bottom of the recent ratings trend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we may have reached our low point last week," said Tom Capra, who 
formerly was news director at KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles. "There is a lot of 
sampling going on, but we think viewers will rediscover us. It's time to quit 
blaming Deborah Norville for Jane Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
Norville has been criticized by some TV reviewers for seeming to lack Pauley's 
warmth and chemistry with Gumbel and for sometimes rushing through her 
interviews. Since he joined the show, Capra said, "I don't think the program 
races any more -- it seemed to be relentless in the past. Bryant and Deborah 
have more time to talk to each other. We're exposing ourselves more to the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
"Today" will travel to Los Angeles for the Oscars later this month, but Capra 
said that he plans no major revamp of the series or any changes in the on-air 
talent.

   ABC News anchorwoman Paula Zahn, bound for ``CBS
This Morning,'' said goodbye on the air Thursday to her ``Good
Morning America'' colleagues, not mentioning CBS but saying, ``I
have a wonderful opportunity to go into.''
   Although CBS had no comment on reports she is joining CBS News,
her agent, Richard Leibner, confirmed she is headed there. He
declined to elaborate.
   ``After a few tiny details are wrapped up, there's no question
that she'll be at CBS,'' said Leibner, who handled negotiations for
Diane Sawyer when she left CBS last year to join ABC as co-anchor
of ``Prime-Time Live.''
   Zahn's ABC contract ended Thursday. A source close to her
contract talks said ABC hoped she would stay there but didn't make
a counteroffer to CBS' bid, a four-year pact paying about $1.1
million annually.
   Zahn, who joined ABC News in the fall of 1987, has been
co-anchor of ``World News This Morning'' and the news segments of
``Good Morning America'' since May 1988. The latter program is
produced by ABC Entertainment.
   A source familiar with negotiations for her services said that
Zahn would succeed Kathleen Sullivan as co-anchor of the
bottom-rated ``CBS This Morning'' and probably would start work
Feb. 26.
   Friday will be Sullivan's last day on the program, according to
a memo sent staff members by the show's executive producer, Erik
Sorenson, who said Faith Daniels would be her temporary replacement
next week.
   In a statement, ABC News President Roone Arledge praised Zahn's
work and said, ``We wish her all the best in her new assignment.''
   ``ABC was terrific to her, she loved it there'' and appreciated
what Arledge and others did for her, Leibner said. ``But an
extraordinary opportunity doesn't come down the pike that often.
It's a sad departure to a new adventure.''
   Zahn's move to CBS has been expected ever since Ron Konecky,
Sullivan's agent, said last week that CBS is taking Sullivan off
``CBS This Morning.'' Sullivan and Harry Smith have been co-anchors
of the show since it began in 1987.
   In her farewell to viewers and ``Good Morning America'' co-host
Charles Gibson and weatherman Spencer Christian, Zahn said that it
had been ``an absolute pleasure'' working at ABC News.
   ``I have a wonderful opportunity to go into,'' she said. ``The
details are being worked out at this moment, so we can't really
talk specifically what they are about. You can expect the
announcement soon.''
   No replacement for her has been chosen, an ABC spokeswoman said.
   Zahn, a native of Naperville, Ill., previously was an anchor and
reporter at Los Angeles TV station KCBS, where Sullivan began in
1977. Zahn started her career a year later at WFAA-TV in Dallas.
   Sullivan's CBS contract expires in November. Konecky said last
week that CBS had given no specific reason why they wanted to
replace her and had set no date for her to leave. He said he was
discussing other possibilities for her at CBS.
   When Sullivan leaves the program, it will mark the second time
this year that a network anchorwoman has been replaced on a morning
program.
   In a controversial shift last month, Jane Pauley, co-host of
NBC's ``Today'' for 13 years, was succeeded by Deborah Norville.
The move hasn't helped that show in the ratings.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, ``Today'' last week was
second to ``Good Morning America'' for the sixth consecutive week.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.4 rating and ``Today'' 3.7. CBS' show,
third in ratings since it began, although doing better in the
Nielsens than its predecessor, ``The Morning Show,'' had a 2.7.
   Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.

   ``CBS This Morning'' anchorwoman Kathleen
Sullivan, who said last year that she expected to be replaced if
her show's third-place ratings didn't improve, is being taken off
the program, her spokesman said today.
   ``She was notified by CBS brass Wednesday night,'' said the
spokesman, John Scanlon, who described Sullivan as ``disappointed,
but proud of her contributions to the show.''
   The program, co-anchored by Harry Smith, made no mention today
that she is leaving. Sullivan did not say anything about it on the
air. Terry Everett, a CBS News spokeswoman, said today that the
network ``can't confirm or deny'' reports that she is leaving.
   The anchorwoman, whose CBS contract expires in November, did her
part of today's show from Atlanta. Everett said the anchorwoman had
gone there on personal business.
   Scanlon said no decision has been made yet on when Sullivan will
leave ``CBS This Morning,'' but that she will help the transition
process and ``is looking forward to discussing other possibilities
at CBS.''
   There have been reports that her successor will be Paula Zahn,
anchorwoman of ABC's ``World News This Morning.'' Sullivan
co-anchored that program and news segments of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' before joining CBS News in 1987.
   ``We have no comment at this point,'' said ABC spokesman Scott
Richardson when asked if Zahn may be leaving ABC for CBS.
   ``CBS This Morning'' has consistently trailed ``Good Morning
America'' and NBC's ``Today'' in the ratings. The latter program
was in the headlines last fall when it became known that Jane
Pauley, the show's co-anchor for 13 years, would be succeeded by
Deborah Norvile.
   Norville began her new job in January.
   In October, during an appearance with Pauley on the ``Donahue''
syndicated talk show, Sullivan said she would be fired if her
show's ratings didn't improve.
   The month before, she riled CBS executives when, while speaking
into a microphone she didn't know was live, she joked that CBS
stood for ``Cheap Broadcasting Service.'' The comment was heard on
CBS' closed-circuit television system, but was not broadcast over
the air.

   In the third farewell to viewers by a network
news anchorwoman since October, Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This
Morning'' said goodbye Friday and obliquely confirmed that Paula
Zahn will succeed her.
   However, CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said the network had no
announcement to make on Sullivan's successor. A CBS source said the
announcement of the hiring of Zahn, who has left ABC, is expected
Tuesday.
   In her goodbye to viewers, Sullivan, who had co-anchored the
show with Harry Smith since its premiere in November 1987, appeared
upbeat but near tears.
   ``Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two of my other children
at ABC, and now I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, `CBS
This Morning,''' she said.
   Before joining CBS, Sullivan co-anchored ABC's ``World News This
Morning'' and the news segments of ``Good Morning America.'' She
was succeeded on those programs by Zahn, who said her farewells on
the latter show Thursday.
   NBC's Jane Pauley, replaced by Deborah Norville in January as
co-host of the ``Today'' show, confirmed that controversial move on
the air Oct. 29, and made her farewell on the show Dec. 29. She
remains at NBC News.
   Zahn's agent, Richard Leibner, has said his client is going to
CBS but said Friday that a few details still must ironed out.
   According to a source close to her contract talks, ABC officials
liked her work but decided not to make a counter-offer to CBS'
offer of a $1.1 million-a-year, four-year contract.
   CBS has said ``CBS Morning News'' co-anchor Faith Daniels will
be next week's temporary co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning.''
   On Friday, Sullivan did not say why she was leaving.
   Her agent, Ron Konecky, has said CBS executives gave no reason
for their decision to replace her, and that he is discussing other
possibilities for her at CBS. Her contract expires in November.
   Sullivan told viewers that she's proud of what her show
accomplished: ``We've restored the credibility that said we meant
business in the morning here at CBS.''
   Her program's predecessor, ``The Morning Show,'' was a frothy,
short-lived entertainment show that CBS tried after years of
generally failing to make a dent in morning ratings with a news
program.
   There were cheers at CBS News when it got the morning time
period back and put in ``CBS This Morning.'' The program, while
getting a larger audience than its predecessor, still is a distant
third in ratings to ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
   Noting that eight of her 10 years on national television have
been on morning shows, Sullivan said she plans to take a break.
   ``I'm hoping to do some really wild and wonderful things,'' she
said, but didn't elaborate.
   ``So, if I show up on your doorstep because I ran out of gas or
my horse broke down, please don't forget me.''
   Alluding to the 1984 Olympics telecasts she co-anchored while at
ABC, she concluded her farewell by saying, ``Yeah, I'm the one who
wore the sweaters in the Olympics. ... I'm a bit older, but I'm
also a bit wiser.''

   In what will be the second exit of a network
morning anchorwoman in a year's time, Kathleen Sullivan is being
replaced on ``CBS This Morning,'' her agent said Friday.
   CBS said it can't confirm or deny that.
   Sullivan, whose CBS contract expires in November, got the word
Wednesday in a meeting with CBS News President David Burke and
other executives, said her agent, Ron Konecky. No date is set for
her departure, he said.
   ``Not really,'' he said when asked if they gave any reason why
they wanted to replace her on the two-hour morning show that she
has co-anchored with Harry Smith since its premiere Nov. 30, 1987.
   ``I think that was a management decision they felt they had to
make,'' Konecky said. ``I'm having ongoing, positive meetings with
them with a view to other assignments for Kathleen at CBS.''
   There have been reports she will be succeeded by Paula Zahn,
co-anchor of ABC's ``World News This Morning,'' and the news
segments of the following ``Good Morning America.''
   Scott Richardson, an ABC spokesman, said he had no comment on
whether Zahn will leave ABC. CBS spokeswoman Terry Everett said CBS
can't confirm or deny if Sullivan, 36, is out at ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Asked if Sullivan's co-anchor, Smith, is staying at the CBS
show, a CBS official who spoke on condition he not be identified by
name said yes.
   From its start, the program has been a distant third in ratings
to ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.'' Speaking last
October on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show last fall, Sullivan
predicted ``my days are numbered'' if the ratings didn't improve.
   Ironically, another anchorwoman appearing with her on
``Donahue'' was Jane Pauley, who as part of the most controverial
change in ``Today'' left that show in December after 13 years as
its co-host. She was succeeded in January by Deborah Norville.
   Sullivan co-anchored Friday's ``CBS This Morning'' from Atlanta.
During the broadcast, she made no mention of her impending
depature. Neither did Smith or news anchor Charles Osgood. She
couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
   Everett, who said the program will originate from Florida next
week, said Sullivan had gone to Atlanta on personal business.
   Ted Turner's Cable News Network is based in Atlanta, but Konecky
said she wasn't there for talks with CNN officials, nor was he
negotiating with them for her.
   He said CBS officials have asked her to stay on at ``CBS This
Morning'' during its transition to a new anchorwoman ``and she's
happy to do so.''
   The news of Sullivan's impending exit, coupled with the
three-month payless suspension of ``60 Minutes'' humorist Andy
Rooney for a racial slur attributed to him, came at an awkward time
for CBS executives.
   A spokesman said that Burke, ``CBS This Morning'' executive
producer Erik Sorenson, and other CBS officials were in Phoenix on
Friday, attending a regional meeting of executives from
CBS-affiliated stations.

Erik Sorenson recently became the second executive producer that "CBS This 
Morning" has had since its debut Nov. 30 two years ago. He has what some 
consider the morning version of "Mission Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Like its previous incarnations, the two-hour program remains a distant third in 
ratings against NBC's "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America." Like his 
predecessors on past and current CBS morning shows, Sorenson is expected to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's impossible," says Sorenson, 33, a former vice president of 
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. "I think it's tough, though." 
</P>

<HEAD>New `CBS This Morning' Producer Has Difficult Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Erik Sorenson recently became the second
executive producer ``CBS This Morning'' has had since its debut on
Nov. 30 two years ago. He has what some consider the morning
version of ``Mission Impossible.''
   Like its previous incarnations, the two-hour program remains a
distant third in ratings against NBC's ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' Like his precedessors on past and current CBS
morning shows, Sorenson is expected to change that.
   ``I don't think it's impossible,'' says Sorenson, 33, a former
vice president of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. ``I think it's
tough, though.''
   That it is. Nielsen figures for last month's important ratings
sweeps _ local stations use the results to set advertising rates _
gave CBS' ``Morning'' a 2.5 ratings average, well behind the ABC
and NBC shows; they were tied with a 4.4. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   But the Nielsens contained a ray of hope for the CBS reveille
team of Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. The ratings were up
two-tenths of a point from those of the previous November. Tiny,
yes, but a start.
   To improve on that, Sorenson, in the custom of new producers,
plans some changes: a different musical arrangement of the show's
theme music; more ratings-boosting travel, and what he calls ``more
visual variety.''
   No costly new set, a staple of arriving executive producers, is
planned by Sorenson, a Waukegan, Ill., native whose background is
in local news.
   But he is trying to get ``name'' contributors on various topics,
among them Chicago-based movie critic Gene Siskel, best known from
the syndicated ``Siskel &amp; Ebert`` film-review series.
   Others contributors, he says, would report on parenting,
science, the environment and aging.
   In addition to his plans to rely more heavily on CBS
correspondents, he has hired two new full-time staffers, features
reporter Wayne Freedman and Hollywood-based entertainment reporter
Steve Kmetko.
   And, in a move that got his show some publicity last week, he
hired CBS Sports reporter Greg Gumbel, the brother of ``Today''
co-host Bryant Gumbel, to do sports segments and occasional fill-in
anchoring on ``CBS This Morning.''
   But Sorenson doesn't think his show will get a swarm of
disaffected ``Today'' viewers next month when Jane Pauley, after 13
years on NBC's show, yields her co-host chair there to Deborah
Norville.
   ``Certainly Jane Pauley has a big following, and her departure
is undoubtedly going to cause some of her followers to look around
at what else is available,'' he says.
   But he theorizes that ``Good Morning America'' would be the
chief beneficiary of any ``Today'' viewer defection simply because
it has been on since 1975 and, like its NBC rival, is a place of
relative stability.
   CBS, in contrast, still is trying to get back morning viewers
who, after all the years of change, may have given up on it, he
says:
   ``I think a lot of viewers don't realize that CBS is a viable
alternative here. And so, I don't think we would stand to gain as
much from this (Pauley's exit) as perhaps GMA will. But I think we
certainly stand to gain.''
   Reassurances of stability in CBS' morning effort might help aid
its cause.
   No doubt for that reason, Sorenson has been downplaying
Sullivan's unusually frank comment last October on ``Donahue'' that
``my days are numbered'' if her show's ratings don't improve.
   Asked if she and Smith will continue as anchors all next year on
``CBS This Morning,'' Sorenson immediately replied, ``Yes.''
   He laughed when advised that constitutes a ringing endorsement
in network TV today. He also added qualifying comments. The anchor
team of Sullivan &amp; Smith will remain ``to the extent'' that he has
control of the situation.
   ``Obviously, there are forces and factors out there in the world
that could change that,'' he said. ``I suppose that if for some
reason, the show started bleeding ... and we started doing a 1.4
(rating) for 12 weeks in a row, somebody would have to say, `Wait a
minute, there's a mistake somewhere ...'
   ``But it's our intention to stay the course, stick with what
we've got, and improve on the program.''

"Today" ratings began declining with co-host Jane Pauley's poised and public

ex-ABC newswoman Paula Zahn. The change has posted a barely discernible 
improvement in ratings. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, keeping the same cast before its cameras, won the No. 1 spot without

Niles said a similar ratings dip occurred after Bryant Gumbel replaced Tom

   These are tough times for NBC's venerable
``Today'' show, the program that invented the morning TV format.
   Last week it lost in the ratings to ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for the ninth consecutive week, and it lost the February
``sweeps'' to ABC for the first time since November 1985.
   Is the sun going down on ``Today''? Is this a new dawn for ABC's
``Good Morning America''? Will ``CBS This Morning'' emerge from the
twilight of third place? Has success spoiled Bryant Gumbel?
   ``Today'' ratings began declining with co-host Jane Pauley's
poised and public departure from the show after 13 years. Her
replacement, NBC newswoman Deborah Norville, apparently reminds
some women of their least-favorite college roommate.
   ``The `Today' show has experienced a serious decline, about 15
percent on average, since Deborah Norville took over,'' said David
Marans, head of media research for the J. Walter Thompson
advertising conglomerate.
   ``There was a clear reaction to the change in casting,'' he
said. ``We could see no other reason for the needle really moving.''
   CBS' morning efforts generally have run a distant third in
ratings almost since the network began competing with ``Today'' in
1954. Predecessors of ``CBS This Morning'' changed personnel, sets
and style so often that a loyal viewer was someone who occasionally
tuned in just to see who or what was still there.
   The current CBS edition's latest attempt at innovation, in
February, was to cashier Harry Smith's co-anchor, Kathleen
Sullivan, in favor of ex-ABC newswoman Paula Zahn and a barely
discernible improvement in ratings.
   ABC, keeping the same cast before its cameras, won the No. 1
spot without significantly increasing its ratings.
   ``It takes a long time to develop a team,'' said Jack Reilly,
executive producer of ``Good Morning America.'' ``It takes an even
longer time for the audience to accept it.''
   Reilly noted that, historically, ``Today'' has led in household
ratings but ABC's show has been more popular among advertisers'
most desirable target groups _ women aged 18 to 49 and men and
women aged 25 to 54.
   NBC officials insist that they're not worried about the numbers.
   ``We knew there was going to be a drop in the ratings for the
`Today' show,'' said NBC research chief Bob Niles. ``The good news
is that we were pretty good about forecasting it. The bad news is
we didn't want to see those numbers.''
   Niles said a similar ratings dip occurred after Gumbel replaced
Tom Brokaw as co-host in January 1982. For the next two years, ABC
beat ``Today'' like a gong. One week in August 1983, ``Today''
finished third for the first time.
   Overall, since January ``Today'' has lagged an average
six-tenths of a rating point behind ``Good Morning America,'' for a
loss of about 600,000 viewers, Niles said.
   Niles said the decline has not prompted NBC to conduct any
immediate audience research to discover just what the problem is.
   ABC's Reilly said: ``Everyone forgets that the pressure that
brought on all these problems over there there was that we were
beating them.''
   And, he noted, it took ``Today'' five years to climb back to No.
1 after Gumbel joined the show.
   Gumbel presaged the current troubles with a memo criticizing
weatherman Willard Scott and other ``Today'' personalities.
   The memo to then-producer Marty Ryan savaged Scott's cornball
act and the timeliness of movie maven Gene Shalit's reviews. It
also faulted consumer reporters David Horowitz and Betty Furness
and medical reporter Dr. Art Ulene.
   Only Pauley escaped Gumbel's wrath. Ryan was succeeded by Tom
Capra, a longtime news producer, who was moving from California to
New York on Friday and could not be interviewed for this story.
   Gumbel, who declined to be interviewed, will be questioned by
Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20-20'' Friday in what should be a
benchmark among interviews of network anchors by other anchors.
   Walters made her own reputation on ``Today,'' which began Jan.
14, 1952, under the late Dave Garroway.
   While ``Today'' is losing viewers with the latest cast change,
there's a hitch for the network competitors.
   ``They're going elsewhere,'' Marans said. ``For the past eight
weeks, there hasn't been a significant increase in ABC or CBS
viewership.''
   So where are they going? Analysts suggest they're tuning in to
increasingly sophisticated local TV morning shows or disappearing
into the cable box.
   ABC's Reilly said the vanishing viewer has been a problem for
the networks for five years. ``There is no one alternative that
comes near (the networks), but collectively there are so many
options out there that people use them.''

<HEAD>``Good Morning America'' Host Heading to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Good Morning America'' co-host Charles Gibson
is going to Saudi Arabia for live Thanksgiving week broadcasts from
U.S. military bases there and a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf, ABC
said Thursday.
   The five-day trip starts Nov. 19. It will be the second time a
network morning show star has broadcast from Saudi Arabia since the
U.S. military buildup began there after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of
Kuwait.
   Bryant Gumble co-anchored NBC's ``Today'' show there for a week
of broadcasts beginning Aug. 17.
   ABC's expedition is more ambitious, partly because its show will
be freer to travel to U.S. military bases due to a loosening of
restrictions that were in force when Gumbel went there in the early
days of the U.S. buildup.
   Gibson, accompanied by a 16-member crew to include reporter
Steve Fox, will broadcast from two Army camps, an Air Force base,
and a Marine encampment, in addition to the as-yet unidentified
Navy ship. No specific locations can be announced yet because of
security regulations, ABC said.
   Co-host Joan Lunden will remain in New York, doing other
segments of each day's show.
   The show also will broadcast reunions - via satellite - of
members of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia with their families in the
United States.
   Since mid-August, NBC's ``Today'' each day has shown what its
staff has nicknamed ``Hi, Moms'' - tape-recorded greetings of U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia to their families and friends.
   ABC's announcement came as last week's Nielsens showed ``Good
Morning America'' first in ratings for network morning shows for
the 41st consecutive week, easily beating once-dominant ``Today.''
   ABC's show averaged a 4.7 rating, ``Today'' a 3.3 and ``CBS This
Morning'' a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Today,'' which is trying to rebound
against ABC's front-running ``Good Morning America,'' was the only
network morning show that failed to increase its ratings last week,
the A.C. Nielsen Co. said Friday.
   ``Today'' actually lost sixth-tenths of a ratings point as it
came in second to ``Good Morning America'' for the 35th consecutive
week, Nielsen said.
   ``Today,'' which rose to a 3.7 rating two weeks ago when anchor
Bryant Gumbel was reporting from the Middle East, slipped to a 3.1
last week.
   ABC's morning show showed a 10 percent increase in audience,
averaging a 4.3 rating, and ``CBS This Morning'' showed a slight
increase, getting a 2.5 rating. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   On Monday, the ``Today'' studio will inaugurate a new set.
   The show's ratings woes began before the departure of co-anchor
Jane Pauley and the January appointment of Deborah Norville as her
successor.
   On Tuesday, Norville announced that she is pregnant and expects
to give birth in March, but she did not say how long she would be
away from the show.
   Former ``Today'' co-host Joe Garagiola, 64, who rejoined the
show as a third co-anchor in June, left the show for four weeks on
Aug. 31 to undergo elective surgery for an undisclosed medical
problem.

   NBC's revamped ``Today'' show had a slight
ratings increase in its first week, but ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' won the morning Nielsen race for the 24th straight week.
   Separately, ABC said that Joan Lunden, the permanent co-host on
``Good Morning America'' since 1980, has signed a five-year
contract to continue on the show. Her salary was not disclosed.
   Lunden joined ``Good Morning America'' in 1976 as a reporter and
temporary co-host.
   ``Good Morning America'' averaged a 4.0 rating last week, easily
beating ``Today,'' which averaged a 3.3, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co. figures released Thursday.
   ABC won despite the wide attention given to last week's return
of former ``Today'' host Joe Garagiola to NBC's show on a
three-day-a-week basis.
   The ratings for the new-look ``Today'' was up two-tenths of a
point from the previous week. The perenially third-place ``CBS This
Morning'' averaged a 2.3 rating. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.

<TEXT>
   NBC's Jane Pauley, safely away from the woes and
slipping ratings of the ``Today'' show she once co-hosted, starts
life anew in prime time Tuesday with an appropriately entitled
special: ``Changes.''
   Her own changes include anchoring a prime-time news series that
NBC once said might start this summer. However, it has no executive
producer yet and may not arrive until fall or even January, she
says.
   But she doesn't consider this the NBC News version of ``Waiting
for Godot.''
   ``I think it's very sensible,'' Pauley says of the delay. In her
view, ``Corporations don't normally behave sensibly if there is
some pressure to put something on the air. But this strikes me as a
very rational way to approach a weekly series, and I'm very pleased
with that.''
   On Saturday, Pauley, who also has been filling in for Tom Brokaw
on the ``NBC Nightly News,'' leaves for East Germany to start
another documentary on sports there. A few more documentaries lie
ahead after that.
   Tuesday's special is about three people and one couple whose
lives are in transition. Work on the first story, about Frank
Morgan, a 56-year-old acclaimed jazz saxophonist who spent much of
his life in prison, began in December.
   That was the month that Pauley, her contract extended to 1992,
bid adieu to 13 years of predawn wakeups for ``Today.'' She had
told its audience in October she was leaving and got a hug then
from her successor, Deborah Norville.
   But since January, ``Today'' hasn't exactly been hugged by
viewers, even though Pauley took pains in October to assure them
she wasn't at odds with Norville or co-host Bryant Gumbel, whom she
called her friends.
   Although NBC executives say they have no research to indicate
it, ``Today'' likely was hurt and ABC's ``Good Morning America''
helped by the turmoil preceding Pauley's decision to leave.
   Those off-camera troubles last year included the leak of
Gumbel's caustic memo criticizing staffers, notably weatherman
Willard Scott, and the decision of NBC executives, including
``Today'' vice president Dick Ebersol, to replace veteran ``Today''
news anchor John Palmer with Norville.
   Although NBC officials have said they expected a dip in
``Today'' ratings when Norville moved up from news anchor to
succeed Pauley in January, the dip now is in its third month.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' easily won the important February
ratings ``sweeps,'' the results used by TV stations to set their
advertising rates. It averaged a 4.5 rating, which was good news
for ABC affiliates.
   No so for NBC affiliates. ``Today,'' according to NBC's
estimate, had a 3.65 average in the sweeps _ well below the 4.6 it
had in February 1989 when it won the reveille ratings race. Each
ratings point now represents 921,000 homes.
   Pauley, who last year kept a stiff upper lip and never publicly
complained about the behind-camera woes at ``Today,'' is
sympathetic to its current ratings problems.
   ``Well, I've been there before,'' she says, harking back to a
time when she co-hosted ``Today'' with Brokaw and the Nielsen
verdict was that ``Good Morning America,'' then hosted by David
Hartman, had become No. 1.
   ``It was almost a relief when it finally happened,'' she says.
``Because from that moment on, we were able to scramble and get our
act together and come back.''
   She thinks the same thing will happen again, and that those in
charge of ``Today,'' including new executive producer Tom Capra,
will ``be able to put together something that comes on pretty
strong.''
   Pauley laughed uproariously when asked about an upcoming report
in the National Enquirer confiding that NBC, on bended knee, had
begged her to return to ``Today'' and that she has agreed to
interview guests on two of five shows each week, starting in April.
   ``Totally bogus,'' she said.
   Her own thoughts about the ``Today'' turmoil and its effect on
the show's ratings?
   ``Obviously, I can't personalize it,'' she said. ``And yet, I
think that an explanation is that there were `dislocations,' shall
we say, on the `Today' show. ... And I think that bothers people,
especially early in the morning.
   ``It's not just that `Jane is gone.' It's just that there was
too much disruption. In the morning, you want, er, regularity.''

   In an unusually frank comment Monday, ``CBS This
Morning'' co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan said ``my days are numbered''
at the program if its ratings, now third among network morning
shows, don't improve.
   Sullivan spoke while on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show with her
two female competitors on network morning programs, Joan Lunden of
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and Jane Pauley, who is leaving
``Today'' at the end of this year.
   ``I can't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,''
Sullivan said when asked by host Phil Donahue if she was feeling
the pressure of being on a program that is third in the ratings.
   The CBS News program, which Sullivan co-anchors with Harry
Smith, premiered on Nov. 30, 1987. It succeeded a short-lived,
low-rated entertainment show, and was the latest in CBS' long
effort to compete in the morning.
   Although Sullivan said her program's ratings have risen 50 per
cent since it began, she also said that if more viewers don't watch
``and we don't improve from where we are (in ratings), my days are
numbered.
   ``And I don't think there's a question about that. That's the
business. I know that. I'm a grownup.''
   Sullivan, who joined CBS from ABC, didn't elaborate. There was
no immediate comment from CBS.
   During Monday's show Pauley _ who last Friday told her national
``Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be
succeeded by news anchor Deborah Norville _ reiterated that it was
her decision to leave.
   However, she said in response to a viewer's question, she
wouldn't be leaving as soon as she is had not Norville, whom she
has called a friend, been hired for the program. Norville became
its news anchor on Sept.5.
   ``No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in
attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said,
referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program.
   ``It took some kind of an external jolt, if you will, to propel
me out of a course I had very happily travelled for 13 years,'' she
said.
   Pauley, whose current NBC News contract has been extended to
1992, will co-anchor a prime time news series that will premiere in
late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special
called ``Changes'' in March.

   As millions of viewers grumble their way back
from summer vacations, NBC's ``Today'' show, armed with Faith, hope
and a new set, will attempt to rebound from The Great Debacle of
1989-90.
   The new set, featuring a kitchen and large transparent
photographs of various American scenes, premieres Monday.
   As for the show, its executive producer, Tom Capra, thinks the
worst is over and the ratings slide halted since the June additions
of Faith Daniels as news anchor and ``Today'' returnee Joe
Garagiola as a third co-anchor working with Bryant Gumbel and
Deborah Norville.
   But not even Capra predicts a quick return to the No. 1 ratings
status ``Today'' lost to ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in January
after the exit of the popular Jane Pauley and the arrival of
Norville.
   ``I think it'll take quite a while,'' said the producer, who was
brought in last January with seemingly simple marching orders:
``Fix it.''
   But nothing is simple in the world of the Morning Wars, where a
few ratings points can mean millions of dollars in losses or
profits, where revolving-door casting has jolted NBC and CBS into
the headlines, where ABC glories in its resurrection while
brandishing a new weapon _ a geography correspondent.
   ``Today'' hired Garagiola to give the show a feeling of
``family'' again. But even with the avuncular former catcher,
``Today'' suffered a summer week it would prefer to forget _ a 2.9
rating, its lowest in seven years.
   It has edged upwards since then. Still, ``Today'' ratings for
the period from January to mid-August are down 17 percent from last
year, according to Nielsen. Those of ``Good Morning America'' rose
by 10 percent, and third-place ``CBS This Morning'' also went up
slightly, by 4 percent.
   One week in May, CBS' show _ traditionally the morning doormat _
even beat ``Today'' in New York, the nation's largest TV market.
   ``Today'' had begun to slide in the ratings last summer before
the elevation of Norville, first as the show's news reader, then in
January as co-anchor with Gumbel. The perception by some viewers
that the 32-year-old Norville had somehow muscled the 40-year-old
Pauley aside made things worse.
   In June, NBC affiliates heard a frank ``we screwed up'' from NBC
News chief Michael Gartner. A month later, he admitted the ratings
slide may cost NBC $10 million and its affiliates an equal amount
by year's end.
   When would ``Today'' recapture the Nielsen championship from its
ABC rival? ``It's going to be many months,'' Capra said.
   He grinned. ``You can lose an audience a lot faster than you can
gain one. We certainly have have proved that. But we seem to have
stopped the (ratings) hemorrhaging here.''
   With Gumbel last month spending a week in Saudi Arabia,
anchoring his part of the show as part of NBC's coverage of the
Persian Gulf crisis, ``the ratings have settled out and are
creeping ahead a little,'' Capra said.
   But in the opinion of Betsy Frank, senior vice president of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the worst isn't over yet for
``Today.''
   ``It doesn't seem to have recovered,'' she said. Yes, she says,
the ratings rose in recent weeks, as they have for the show's two
network rivals, but that is largely due to public interest in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   She says ``The particular drama of what happened on the `Today'
show last winter should have passed by now. Yet its ratings have
continued to decline while those of `Good Morning America' continue
to grow.''
   Erik Sorenson, executive producer of ``CBS This Morning,''
smells ``Today'' blood. ``We're very much in striking distance and
in some markets we're actually beating them,'' says Sorenson.
   His show debuted in November 1987 with the anchor team of Harry
Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. Although but a tyke compared to the
38-year-old ``Today'' and 15-year-old ``Good Morning America,'' the
CBS show already has had its shakeups.
   The major one was the replacement of Sullivan by ABC graduate
Paula Zahn last February. But the show also has added six new
contributors, including film reviewer Gene Siskel and sports
reporter Greg Gumbel, older brother of you-know-who.
   The show now has ``more diversity in the segments than there
used to be,'' Sorenson says. ``There are more entertainment
segments, more celebrity segments, and more pieces from
contributors.''
   Interestingly, there's been some change over at ``Good Morning
America.'' There are fewer celebrity interviews, even though the
show is produced by ABC's entertainment division, not its news
division.
   ``We still do them ... but not tve done it in
the past,'' says Jack Reilly, GMA's executive producer.
   The reason: A star blur of sorts that has come with o the degree we'the
growth
of cable, where celebrity interviewees are often found when not
being grilled by Connie Chung, Barbara Walters or a producer from
``Entertainment Tonight.''
   Star interviews used to be ``much more exclusive to morning
television'' 10 years ago, Reilly said.
   But ``now you hear that Arnold Schwarzenegger has a new movie
and you go, `Where did I see him? I don't know if I saw him on
``Good Morning America'' or ``Entertainment Tonight'' or CNN's

<HEAD>Sullivan: `Days are Numbered' At `CBS This Morning' Unless Ratings

<TEXT>
   ``CBS This Morning'' co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan
said her job is in jeopardy if the ratings for her program don't
improve.
   ``I can't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,''
Sullivan said when asked by Phil Donahue on his syndicated
``Donahue'' show if she was feeling the pressure of being on a
program with poor ratings _ now third among network morning shows.
   Sullivan appeared Monday with her two female competitors on

this year.
   The CBS program, which Sullivan co-anchors with Harry Smith,

   Sullivan said her program's ratings have risen 50 percent since

   There was no immediate comment from CBS.
   During Monday's show Pauley _ who last Friday told her national
``Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be
succeeded by news anchor Deborah Norville _ said if Norville hadn't
been hired, she wouldn't be leaving so soon.
   Norville became the show's news anchor on Sept.5.
   ``No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in
attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said,
referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program.
   Pauley, whose current NBC News contract has been extended to
1992, will co-anchor a prime-time news series that will premiere in
late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special
called ``Changes'' in March.

<HEAD>We Are Family, Hopes the `Today' Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During last week's NBC affiliates convention,
Deborah Norville faced station officials and said of the ``Today''
cast: ``This is a family. I'm sorry the print press doesn't see it
that way.''
   NBC hopes a more important audience _ viewers _ will see it that
way today as it re-launches ``Today'' with Joe Garagiola, Faith
Daniels and Katie Couric joining Norville, Bryant Gumbel, Willard
Scott and Gene Shalit on the troubled show.
   The network's We Are Family plan puts a lot of hope on the
addition of the gregarious Garagiola, 64, a popular ``Today''
co-host from 1969 to 1973. He'll join Gumbel and Norville as co-host
on Tuesdays through Thursdays.
   (The print press keeps calling them co-hosts. Wrong, NBC recently
has been emphasizing. Gumbel is the show's anchor. Norville and
Garagiola are co-anchors. Oh, the print press has said.)
   Daniels, late of CBS, will be the news anchor, while Couric, who
has a lively wit, will be the show's national correspondent based in
Washington, where one can find far more harrumph than humor.
   Only time will tell, as they say on TV, whether the newcomers and
NBC's image-rebuilding effort makes Nielsen families welcome the
show back to their bosoms, or at least to the people-meters in 4,000
homes.
   As all but the dead know, co-host Jane Pauley left the show in
December after 13 years. She was privately angered by ``Today''
changes that began last summer, but steadfastly has refused to blame
Norville, her successor.
   Since Pauley's exit, the previously top-rated ``Today'' has been
riding the crest of a slump.
   It has trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for 22 weeks, its
year-to-date ratings are 17 percent below those of 1989, and they're
down 17 percent in what some consider a key demographic group _
women aged 18 to 49.
   That means uh-oh time. The ratings drop translates into millions
of dollars in lost advertising revenue for both NBC and its 209
affiliates.
   However, notes Betsy Frank, a senior vice president at Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising in New York, the drop didn't start when Norville
became ``Today'' co-host in January, just five months after she
became its news anchor.
   The show's ratings were ``trending down even before the
`cataclysmic' Norville-Pauley change,'' she says.
   That's why NBC officials began tinkering with ``Today'' in the
first place _ to get the ratings back up. Alas, they foaled only a
public relations nightmare and failure.
   In Round Two of tinkering, the hiring of old pro Garagiola came
as a surprise, particularly to those expecting NBC to commit
thirtysomething video voodoo to win back those younger,
demographically desirable female viewers.
   But the bald, affable former major league catcher probably will
do that, says Tom Capra, a ``Today'' rookie. He became the show's
executive producer in January.
   ``I think he's kind of an Everyman,'' Capra says. ``Everyone
likes Joe _ younger women, old men, everybody. He's just kind of a
universal figure.''
   Capra tends to scoff at those who write of the women 18-to-49 age
group as if that group were to morning ratings what oxygen is to
life its ownself.
   He'd like to have that audience watching ``Today,'' he says, but
it ``is not gigantic in the morning on any show.'' And, he says,
``Our show, as are all the other morning shows, is sold on the basis
of households as well as demographics.''
   ``We also think that our core `Today' audience is still loyal to
us,'' Capra says, ``and just isn't watching us as often as they used
to. So we believe that the addition of Joe will cause them to come
home.''
   Frank says NBC, in seeking the top ``Today'' ratings of
yesteryear, is hoping to ``recapture some of that warmth and family
appeal'' the show once had.
   ``Garagiola seems to be a pretty good choice,'' she says. ``But
my question is ... whether people, for whatever reason, have not
gotten into the `Good Morning America' habit. And whether the
addition of Joe is enough to bring `Today' back.''

HOWARD ROSENBERG: STATIONS PULL OUT A TRUMP CARD -- AND LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There must be a reason why America should so desperately care about the private 
lives and public machinations of Donald and Ivana Trump. None immediately comes 
to mind, however. 
</P>
<P>
Here, it seems, is the classic example of media creating a topic for discussion 
and then breathing so much hot air into their own fatuous creation that it 
takes on a blimpish life of its own. 
</P>
<P>
This is a Frankenstein monster, a non-story, an emperor preening without his 
clothes. More than anything, however, public discourse over the Trumps -- 
concerning who gets how many assets in the dissolution of a billion-dollar 
marriage that probably few Americans knew even existed until recently -- is a 
microcosm of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It's here. It's bigger than life. But why? 
</P>
<P>
Now c'mon. Before all of this was fattened into obesity by battling New York 
gossip columnists and then gorged on by newspaper and TV tabloids and 
ultimately the mainstream media, did you care? 
</P>
<P>
Most of us didn't even know the name of Trump's wife until a few weeks ago. Now 
we're supposed to be alarmed that she may be getting only $25 million or $50 
million from her macro-industrialist husband? This is a human rights issue? A 
feminist issue? A social issue? Ivana Trump, persecuted homeless person? 
</P>
<P>
Fight back those tears. 
</P>
<P>
Give her all of Manhattan if it will kill this trivia tapeworm that has invaded 
even the likes of news programs that define themselves as legitimate. Forget 
about "A Current Affair" or "Hard Copy" or "Donahue" or "Geraldo" or "Oprah." 
This was "PrimeTime Live" -- a production of ABC News -- that last Thursday 
opened with the Trumps tabloid style, a mocking treatment that at once 
ridiculed the story and feasted on it. To emphasize just how low "PrimeTime 
Live" and its anchors, Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson, had sunk, the Trump 
segment was followed by a tie-in piece about suffering divorcees that also 
could have played just as easily on one of the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing that Erik Sorenson did after taking over the helm of "CBS This 
Morning" was to aggressively pursue Paula Zahn to replace Kathleen Sullivan as 
Harry Smith's co-host. Zahn started Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Sullivan was all that deficient -- in fact, she'd grown in the 
job -- only that Zahn promises to be much better, based on her work as morning 
news anchor on ABC and earlier as news anchor on KCBS Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
Here's some simple addition: Zahn plus Deborah Norville (who recently succeeded 
Jane Pauley on NBC's "Today") plus ABC's "Good Morning America" co-host Joan 
Lunden equals three blonds. A caller noted that fact recently, charging that 
the men who hire the talent at the big three networks favor dumb-blond 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. In this instance, however, the charge doesn't fit, for Zahn has always 
projected an intelligence and sophisticated world awareness lacking in some of 
her counterparts, regardless of hair color or gender. 
</P>
<P>
Here is one show where smarts and likability coexist smoothly, as evidenced by 
holdover Smith and by Zahn's Monday debut, in which she capably handled the 
show's lead interview with former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday's Nicaraguan 
election. (Bryant Gumbel and Charle Gibson interviewed Carter on "Today" and 
"Good Morning America," respectively). 
</P>
<P>
Yet ratings are ratings, and morning shows are morning shows, so the key to 
Zahn's success or failure may not be her brains -- especially in light of 
Sorenson's background in local news -- but her ability to chat. 
</P>
<P>
If Zahn is Sorenson's best move, however, his worst is dropping Peter 
Bogdanovich, whose charming, wise and highly literate vignettes on movies were 
something to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
Adding the thin and tepid entertainment reports of Channel 2's Steve Kmetko 
hardly fills that void, nor, likely, would signing movie critic Gene Siskel, 
with whom "CBS This Morning" has been negotiating. The major strength of 
"Siskel and Ebert" -- still by far the best of TV's movie review shows -- 
remains the chemistry between Siskel and Roger Ebert, not either as an 
individual. Although a great team, moreover, they always seem to sputter in 
national TV appearances beyond their syndicated series. 
</P>
<P>
So the verdict on Sorenson so far is one thumb up, the other down. 
</P>
<P>
Amazing, isn't it? With all the money they invest in their local newscasts, 
you'd think that KNBC Channel 4 and KABC Channel 7 could spare a few bucks for 
a dictionary. But nohhhhhh. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night of ratings sweeps frenzy, Channel 4 introduced David 
Sheehan's interview with Tom Cruise as "exclusive" and Channel 7 introduced 
Gary Franklin's interview with Cruise as "exclusive." Astonishingly, these 
"exclusive" interviews of the same actor appeared on their respective newscasts 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, shmuise, what does it matter anyway? It's not like getting an interview 
with Greta Garbo or something. But honesty should matter. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's New World Dictionary defines "exclusive" as: "Excluding or tending to 
exclude all others; shutting out other considerations, happenings, existances, 
etc." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the interviews were not "exclusive," but the introduction to 
each -- by excluding and shutting out consideration of a competing Cruise 
interview -- was carried out in an exclusive manner. 
</P>
<P>
Another definition also applies here, the dictionary definition of a lie: "A 
false statement or action, especially one made with intent to deceive."

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third consecutive week, ABC`s ``Good
Morning America'' last week beat NBC's ``Today'' show in ratings,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates released Thursday.
   In what has become a tight morning-show battle since Jane Pauley
left as co-host of ``Today'' last month, ABC's show averaged a 4.4
rating, ``Today'' a 3.9, and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.5. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   An ABC spokeswoman said the victory of ``Good Morning America''
was the first time the show had won three consecutive weeks since
fall of 1987. But a ``Today'' spokeswoman expressed optimism that
NBC's show would again be No. 1, saying ``it's only a matter of
time.''
   On Monday, NBC's program will get a new executive producer, Tom
Capra. He is the former news director of NBC-owned KNBC-TV in
Burbank, Calif.

   ABC`S ``Good Morning America'' again triumphed
over NBC's ``Today'' show, averaging a 4.5 rating last week against
the 3.8 of ``Today,'' A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed
Thursday.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained a distant third with a 2.6 rating.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ABC's victory marked the fifth consecutive week it has beaten
``Today,'' which in attempting to fend off ABC's challenge has
undergone a series of changes, including the much-publiziced
departure of Jane Pauley in December.
   Pauley, the show's co-host for 13 years, was succeeded by
Deborah Norville, who had been the program's news anchor since
September.
   The longest previous winning stretch of `Good Morning America''
over once-dominant ``Today'' occurred in October and November 1987,
when ABC's show won its morning time period for six straight weeks.

   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' last week had its
largest audience in more than four years and won the ratings race
for network morning shows for the 45th consecutive week.
   A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates on Thursday showed ABC's program won
easily over NBC's ``Today,'' averaging a 5.2 rating to a 3.5. ``CBS
This Morning'' had a 2.6 rating. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   Ratings were up for ``Good Morning'' and ``Today.'' NBC's
once-dominant show fell behind ``Good Morning'' in January after
the much-publicized replacement of co-anchor Jane Pauley by Deborah
Norville.
   Last week's ratings for ``Good Morning America'' were the show's
highest since the week that ended April 21, 1986, ABC said. The
show also had a 5.2 rating then, but a ratings point at that time
represented 859,000 homes.

   After 13 years of predawn ``Today'' wakeups,
co-host Jane Pauley confirmed to a national audience this morning
that she's leaving the NBC show at year's end. She hugged her
successor, Deborah Norville, and gave her an alarm clock.
   Pauley's farewell announcement, in which she said she'll most
miss working with co-host Bryant Gumbel, was preceded by his
comments in which he criticized ``idle and often erroneous
speculation'' about the troubled, top-rated show.
   Gumbel said the speculation had been ``much to the detriment of
all of us here.''
   Pauley had been reported to be unhappy at recent changes on the
show, including the Sept. 5 arrival of Norville as its news anchor,
succeeding John Palmer.
   Referring to Pauley as ``my buddy'' and that ``it goes without
saying that I'm going to miss her,'' Gumbel said that she's leaving
the show ``sometime at the end of this year or January of next
year.''
   Pauley, who turns 39 on Tuesday, has two years remaining on an
NBC contract reportedly paying her $1.2 million annually. She is
going to co-anchor a prime-time news series next year, she said in
an interview after the show.
   In the interview, she confirmed what she had alluded to in the
show, that she had in fact had asked to leave it.
   She said there were a number of changes that had been made that
had worried her, and Norville's arrival and Palmer's departure to
the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise'' was only one of them. She said
she also thought that NBC executives wanted her to leave.
   She said she had had ``tough'' talks with NBC News President
Michael Gartner and NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol, who wears a
second hat overseeing ``Today.''
   Initially, she said, ``we didn't believe each other. They did
not believe that I simply wanted to leave the `Today' show. And I
did not believe that they were committed to my future here at NBC.''
   But eventually, she said, each side reached an understanding and
a deal was worked out for her to leave ``Today'' at the end of the
year and co-anchor a new, as-yet untitled prime time news series
that will premiere next June. The other co-anchor hasn't been
chosen, she said.
   During the show, she said that persuading NBC that it was time
for a change of staff on ``Today'' was ``the hardest thing I have
ever done. It has taken two long months.''
   She took pains to play down reports she was at odds with either
Gumbel or Norville, saying ``it has hurt to see two of my friends,
Bryant and Deborah, assigned roles in this that they did not play.''
   Pauley joined ``Today'' in 1976 when she left NBC-owned WMAQ-TV
in Chicago to succeed Barbara Walters.
   Pauley noted that when she joined the show, her prececessor, the
first full-time female anchor on the 36-year-old program, sent her
a telegram wishing her good luck and a good alarm clock. Then
Pauley smiled, gave Norville an alarm clock, and the two hugged.
   Norville praised Pauley, saying ``You're a tough act to repeat
and I won't even try.''
   Before the show went to a commercial, she, Gumbel and Norville
held hands in a nationally televised show of solidarity.
   No decision has been made on who will succeed Norville, 31, as
anchor of the two-hour program's news segments. The former anchor
of the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise,'' she swapped jobs last month
with Palmer.
   Although ``Today'' consistently has led in morning-show ratings
over its closest competitor, ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
turmoil on NBC's program began early this year with the leak of a
scathing memo from Gumbel.
   The memo, while not mentioning Pauley, criticized several staff
members on the show, particularly weatherman Willard Scott.
   Scott has eased off the pointed jokes he made to and about
Gumbel after the memo's disclosure, and he denied on Wednesday
speculation that he'll leave ``Today'' shortly after Pauley does.
He joined the show in 1980.
   Gumbel became a ``Today'' co-host in January 1982. Norville
joined NBC News and its ``NBC News at Sunrise'' five years later
from the network's Chicago station.
   This summer, she signed a five-year contract reportedly worth $1
million a year.

<TEXT>
   Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' show, has been signed to serve a similar role for a new
television program that Whittle Communications plans to put in
medical waiting rooms this fall.
   Lunden has signed a three-year contract to host Special Reports
Television, a commercially-sponsored TV show that premieres in
October.
   Whittle Communications, based in Knoxville, Tenn., expects the
one-hour program will be airing continuously in 20,000 doctor's
reception areas by January, reaching an annual audience of nearly
50 million viewers, mainly young mothers.
   The company is now approaching advertisers about buying
commercial time on the programs and is recruiting doctors who will
let it put its television set in their waiting rooms and will play
the program through the working day.
   The programs will be distributed on videodiscs and new programs
will be made available every two weeks.
   Lunden was quoted as saying she views the service as ``a vehicle
to deliver vital family information and news directly to parents.''
   ``That makes it a very worthwhile project,'' she said.
   She joined ``Good Morning America'' in 1976 as a consumer
reporter and became co-host in 1980.
   Last fall, she became the host of a nationally syndicated
daytime talk show called ``Everyday.'' She has hosted videos and a
TV special on parenting.
   She and her husband have three daughters.

<HEAD>Kathleen Sullivan Bids Farewell To `CBS This Morning'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with quotes from show, confirmation
that Zahn will succeed Sullivan.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upbeat but appearing near tears, Kathleen
Sullivan said farewell today as co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning,''
telling viewers that she's proud of the show and jokingly asking
them not to forget her.
   Sullivan, who has been on the show with Harry Smith since it
began in November 1987, also confirmed in her farewell what CBS
spokesmen thus far have refused to comment on _ that ABC's Paula
Zahn will succeed her.
   ``Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two of my other children
at ABC, and now I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, `CBS
This Morning,''' Sullivan said in her final day on the show, which
originated today from Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
   Before joining CBS, Sullivan co-anchored ABC's ``World News This
Morning'' and the news segments of ``Good Morning America.'' She
was succeeded on those programs by Zahn, who bid viewers of those
shows goodbye on Thursday.
   Their back-to-back farewell addresses came about after CBS News
executives decided to replace Sullivan, whose contract expires in
November. According to her agent, Ron Konecky, they gave no reason.
He said he is discussing other possibilities for her at the network.
   Zahn's agent has confirmed that his client is joining CBS News.
According to a source close to her contract talks, ABC officials
liked her work but decided against battling CBS' offer of a $1.1
million-a-year, four-year contract.
   Zahn, who had been earning $275,000 a year at ABC, could start
co-anchoring CBS' show as early as Feb. 26, according to another
source knowledgeable about negotiations for her switch to CBS.
   CBS has said that Faith Daniels, who co-anchors the ``CBS
Morning News'' that precedes ``CBS This Morning,'' will be the
latter program's temporary co-anchor next week.
   Sullivan, whom Smith today thanked ``for being such a great
friend and such a great teacher'' during her stay on the show, told
viewers that ``I'm very proud of what we've accomplished here in
the last 2{ years.
   ``We've restored the credibility that said we meant business in
the morning here at CBS.''
   That was an indirect reference her program's predecessor, ``The
Morning Show,'' a frothy, short-lived entertainment show that CBS
tried after years of generally failing to make a dent in the
ratings with a morning news program.
   Although there were cheers at CBS News when the division got the
morning time period back and put in ``CBS This Morning,'' the
program still is a distant third in ratings to the top-rated ``Good
Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
   Sullivan, noting that eight of her 10 years on national
television have been spent on morning shows, told viewers that she
plans to take a break and that ``I'm hoping to do some really wild
and wonderful things.''
   She didn't elaborate, but added: ``So, if I show up on your
doorstep because I ran out of gas or my horse broke down, please
don't forget me.''
   Sullivan began her television career as an intern in 1977 at Los
Angeles station KNXT-TV, which is owned by CBS and now has the call
letters of KCBS-TV.
   Alluding to the Olympics telecasts she co-anchored while at ABC,
she wryly concluded her farewell by saying, ``Yeah, I'm the one who
wore the sweaters in the Olympics... I'm a bit older, but I'm also
a bit wiser.''

<HEADLINE>  NORVILLE TAKES HER 'ONE CHANCE' TO BE WITH
BABY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Now comes Deborah Norville, leaving NBC's "Today" show to stay home for a
year with her baby, born in February.;    Ironically, Katie Couric, who was
named as Norville's successor Thursday, will be taking a two-month maternity
leave of her own in mid-July.;    Norville, who joined NBC at its owned
affiliate in Chicago in 1981, has had a stormy tenure as co-host on "Today"
since she took over the job in January of last year.;    She replaced Jane
Pauley in a network move widely perceived to be a betrayal of Pauley, and the
show's ratings plunged, leaving "Today" a runner-up to ABC's "Good Morning
America.";    Norville became a media target as "the other woman" in the
ensuing flap. Last month, when she was pictured breast-feeding her baby in
People magazine, she touched off another round of controversy.;    During
Couric's substitute duties, "Today" show ratings slowly began to grow, and
they have been within a fraction of a point of "Good Morning America" for the
past four weeks.;    Norville, however, sought to make clear that leaving the
show was her own idea.;    "During the past month away from my day-to-day
responsibilities, I've had time to reflect on the tumultuous last year and a
half," she said in a statement. "Perhaps my personal situation -- being a new
mother away from the spotlight -- has allowed me to see clearly what I want to
do: give my son the best possible start on life and practice good journalism.;
   "There is plenty of time for the latter, but I'll get only one chance to do
the former.";    NBC officials refused to discuss contractual details of
Norville's departure, including whether or not she will remain on the payroll
or be invited to return. A spokesman would say only that "she continues to
have an arrangement with NBC News.";    Norville has proven herself a valuable
prime-time asset. Two of her NBC specials, "Kids and Sports: Taking the Risk,"
in December, and "Sex, Buys and Advertising," in July, reaped high ratings.
"Bad Girls," broadcast in 1989, covering the increasing tendency of girls to
turn to crime, remains the highest-ranked news documentary in television
history.;    But does all that mean Norville will be welcome back on NBC?;   
"Barbara Walters could drop out of sight for a year and come back and never
miss a beat," said Joe Foote, chairman of the Department of Radio-Television
at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and a specialist in the study of
the "visibility factor" among television news correspondents. "A star can
survive.;    "The question is, is Norville a star? Does she have that
certified staying power? If she has that, a year away isn't going to hurt her.
If she doesn't have that, she's in an insecure position."  </TEXT>

   NBC's ``Today'' show, temporarily in Los Angeles
and bathed in sunshine, may be making some viewers wonder how it
got the sun to rise so early _ since it is 4 a.m. on the West Coast
when the show starts in the East.
   It did it through the magic of videotape. Each morning's show
actually was taped the previous day at 3:30 p.m. PST, spokeswoman
Mary Neagoy said Thursday. Only its news segments were live.
   ``Today,'' normally seen live in Eastern and Central times
zones, originated on tape Wednesday and Thursday from a sunny beach
location at Venice, Ca.
   It will appear Friday, again on tape, from a historic Spanish
section in downtown Los Angeles.
   In the two broadcasts so far, co-host Bryant Gumbel has advised
viewers the shows were taped a day earlier ``to take advantage of
the California sunshine,'' Neagoy said.
   He will repeat the tape-delay advisory on Friday's show, she
added.
   The shows planned for Monday and Tuesday _ each centers on the
Oscar Awards ceremonies that ABC will televise Monday night _ will
be broadcast live, although not in the pre-dawn darkness.
   The shows will originate from inside Mann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood, Neagoy said.
   Despite its taped sunshine this week, ``Today,'' once the leader
in morning show ratings, found a continuing cause for gloom when
last week's audience estimates for morning shows became available
Thursday.
   The show, which in January dropped to second place after the
replacement of co-host Jane Pauley by Deborah Norville, trailed
ABC's first-place ``Good Morning America'' for the 11th consecutive
week.
   ABC's broadcast averaged a 4.5 rating, ``Today'' was a full
ratings point behind, and ``CBS This Morning'' had a 2.5 average,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.

Television will play in as many as 20,000 family doctors'
offices by January. The TV system will be coupled with
Whittle's Special Reports magazines, which are distributed in
about 19,000 medical offices. Whittle said about

<HEAD>NBC's ``Today'' Gets Lowest Ratings in Nearly Seven Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a revamped format and the return of Joe
Garagiola as co-host, NBC's ``Today'' show last week suffered its
lowest ratings in nearly seven years, according to Nielsen audience
estimates Thursday.
   While ABC's ``Good Morning America'' won its 29th consecutive
ratings victory with a 4.2 average, ``Today'' was well behind with
a 2.9, its lowest average since the week of Aug. 6, 1983, when it
had a 2.8 average.
   ``CBS This Morning'' show remained a distant third with a 2.2
average. All three shows declined by a tenth of a point from the
previous week.
   ``Today'' is attempting to recover from a ratings slide that
began in January after 13-year veteran Jane Pauley left the show.
She was its co-host when it hit its previous ratings low in 1983.
   As part of its comeback bid, ``Today'' added the popular
Garagiola as a third co-host in June, has moved to a larger studio
at NBC headquarters, and plans another change in September, a new
set.
   Comparisons for ratings for last week and the same week in 1989
show that ``Good Morning America'' increased its audience by a big
margin, 420,000 homes, while ``Today'' audience was down by 754,000
homes.
   The ratings for ``CBS This Morning'' were unchanged, but the
show was seen in 37,400 more homes than in the same week last year.
   A ratings point currently represents 921,000 homes, compared
with 904,000 homes last year.

<HEAD>NBC Reshuffles Slumping `Today' Show, Brings Joe Garagiola Back as
Co-Host</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a surprise move aimed to revived its slumping
``Today'' show, NBC said today that Joe Garagiola, a familiar face
from the show's past, would join Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville
as a co-host.
   NBC also hired Faith Daniels, co-anchor of the ``CBS Morning
News'' and news segments of ``CBS This Morning,'' to anchor ``NBC
News at Sunrise'' and the news segments of ``Today.''
   Garagiola was a host of the show from 1969 to 1973. He will
return to the show in June.
   The network also announced that Dick Ebersol, who played a
leading part in changes that preceded the ``Today'' drop into
second place, is giving up his job as senior vice president in
charge of ``Today.''
   He will stay as president of NBC Sports, the network said.
   Ebersol came into the turbulent ``Today'' picture last year, and
is widely held responsible for the controversial shift in which
Norville succeeded 13-year veteran Jane Pauley as the show's host
in January.
   Since then, the once-dominant program has run second in ratings
to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   The new shifts come just three weeks before NBC executives are
to face the network's affiliates at NBC's annual convention in
Washington, where NBC News president Michael Gartner likely will
hear complaints.
   ``It is no secret that in recent months `Today' has been through
some trouubled times,'' Gartner said in a statement today. He said
the latest moves were designed ``to expand the cast and build on
the strengths of the program.''
   The network also said that correspondent Katie Couric will
become a full-time correspondent for ``Today'' in Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Slumping `Today' Brings Joe Garagiola Back As Co-Host</HEAD>

   NBC, hoping the past of ``Today'' will help its
tomorrows, said Tuesday it is bringing back Joe Garagiola as a
co-host in a shakeup to help pull the talk show out of a ratings
slump.
   Also Tuesday, NBC hired Faith Daniels as ``Today'' news anchor,
and Dick Ebersol, the network executive behind a series of moves
that preceded the slump, said he was giving up his job as overseer
of the program.
   Garagiola, the show's host from 1969 to 1973, will work with
Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville.
   NBC's surprise announcement comes at a time the once top-rated
show has been sliding deeper into second place in ratings after the
series of changes, including the replacement of Jane Pauley by
Norville in Janary.
   Since then, ``Today'' has trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America''
in the ratings, with the ``CBS Morning News'' a consistent third.
   Garagolia, a popular NBC sportscaster until he left the network
in 1988, will start work in June, as will Daniels, who has been on
maternity leave since the March 25 birth of her second child.
   Daniels, co-anchor of early-morning newscasts at CBS since 1985,
will anchor news segments on ``Today'' and anchor the earlier ``NBC
News at Sunrise.''
   NBC correspondent Katie Couric also was assigned as the
full-time ``Today'' correspondent in Washington, D.C.
   Ebersol said he was giving up his job as the senior executive in
charge of ``Today.'' He'll continue as NBC Sports president and as
a senior NBC News vice president.
   ``Almost all the furor of recent months concerning `Today' has
revolved around my decisions of last fall, and I believe I must
take the primary responsibility for those decisions,'' said Ebersol.
   The uproar began in September when Norville displaced veteran
correspondent John Palmer, a friend of Pauley, as the ``Today''
news anchor, and was moved to the show's desk to sit alongside
Pauley and Gumbel.
   Pauley, who has refused to blame Norville for anything,
reportedly was angered by the moves and finally asked to leave the
show.
   An embarrassed NBC granted her wish. She left in December after
13 years to do prime-time news specials this year and anchor the
``NBC Nightly News'' when Tom Brokaw is on assignment or vacation.
   Tuesday's ``Today'' shuffle came five days after NBC News
president Michael Gartner, also concerned about low ratings for
``NBC Nightly News,'' made another surprise move, hiring Steve
Friedman as that program's executive producer.
   The brash, wise-cracking Friedman was executive producer of
``Today'' when it rose to first in ratings.
   The ``Today'' and ``Nightly'' changes were made three weeks
before NBC affiliates hold their annual convention in Washington.
   A network executive speaking on condition of anonymity said it's
likely that many affiliate executives, while pleased with NBC's
prime-time success, will sharply criticize Gartner for the ratings
woes of the two news shows.
   There was no reply by Gartner to a reporter's request for a
phone interview. In a statement Tuesday, he admitted that ``it is
no secret that in recent months `Today' has been through some
troubled times.
   ``The departure of Jane Pauley left people with a loss of the
sense of family which has been valued throughout the years on
`Today.' These additions are designed to expand the cast and build
on the strengths of the program.''
   He also engaged in self-criticism in referring to the way
Pauley's exit and Norville's entrance were handled.
   ``In hindsight,'' he said, ``NBC News management put ...
Norville in a difficult position, resulting in a more arduous
transition than we had anticipated.''

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' garnered its 16th
consecutive ratings victory Thursday and for the second time in a
month, NBC's once-dominant ``Today'' had its lowest ratings in
nearly three years.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.3 rating last week, the same as for the
previous week. But second-place ``Today'' dropped by two-tenths of
a ratings point to a 3.3 average last week, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co. audience estimates.
   ``Today'' had the same 3.3 average in the week ending April 2.
An NBC official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that was
the show's lowest rating since August 1983.
   The show's ratings decline and the rise of ``Good Morning
America'' began in January, when Deborah Norville succeeded Jane
Pauley as co-host of ``Today.''
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained a distant third in last week's
ratings, averaging a 2.4. Each ratings point represents 921,000
homes.

Kathleen Sullivan believes her days "are numbered" as co-anchor of "CBS This 
Morning" if the show's ratings don't improve. The CBS program is now third 
among network morning shows. Sullivan made her comments on a "Donahue" show 
(seen here Tuesday) that paired her with her opposition, Joan Lunden of ABC's 
"Good Morning America" and Jane Pauley, who is leaving NBC's "Today" at the end 
of this year. "I can't lie about that -- I know the ax is right there," 
Sullivan said. ALEENE MacMINN

<TEXT>
   NBC's slumping ``Today'' show lost to ABC's
``Good Morning America'' in ratings ``sweeps'' for the first time
since November 1985, according to audience estimates made public
Thursday.
   In the Feb. 1-28 sweeps, ABC's show, which has won the ratings
race for the last nine weeks, averaged a 4.5 rating. ``Today'' had
a 3.65 average and third-place ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.7. Each
rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   NBC executives have said they expected ``Today'' ratings to dip
after co-host Jane Paley was succeeded by Deborah Norville in
January. They say that also happened when Bryant Gumbel succeeded
Tom Brokaw on the show in 1982.
   However, February's figures show a considerable drop for
``Today,'' whose troubles include the leak last year of Gumbel's
caustic memo about some staff members, and controversy over
Pauley's replacement by Norville.
   Last year, when a ratings point represented 904,000 homes,
``Today'' won the February sweeps with a 4.6 average, followed
closely by ``Good Morning America'' with a 4.2. ``CBS This
Morning'' averaged a 2.6 then.
   The sweeps occur four times a year and are periods of intense
audience measurements in the nations's 211 TV markets, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co. They are important to local stations, which
use the results to set their advertising rates.

SULLIVAN'S UPBEAT FAREWELL ON 'THIS MORNING'

With an upbeat demeanor that matched her Disney World surroundings, but at 
times appearing near tears, Kathleen Sullivan bid viewers goodby Friday on her 
last day as co-anchor of "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Notified only the day before that Friday would be her last day on the job, 
Sullivan said that she was proud of her work and noted, "Yeah, I'm the one who 
wore the sweaters in the Olympics. I'm a bit older, but I'm also a bit wiser." 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Sullivan, who came to prominence in 1984 on ABC as the first 
woman to co-anchor the Olympics, is being replaced on the 7-9 a.m. weekday 
program by Paula Zahn, the former news anchor on ABC's "Good Morning America." 
Sullivan had been with the CBS show since it was launched in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although CBS still has not made an official announcement, Zahn's agent, Richard 
Leibner, has confirmed that Zahn is going to CBS, and Zahn gave her farewell on 
"Good Morning America" Thursday. CBS is expected to announce Zahn's hiring on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faith Daniels will be the substitute host of "CBS This Morning" next 
week, with Zahn expected aboard the following week. 
</P>
<P>
The hold-up in the official announcement had been ABC's contractual right to 
make a counter-offer to CBS'. ABC is said not to have matched Zahn's new salary 
on CBS, estimated at $1.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan wished her successor well. "Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two 
of my other children at ABC, and I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, 
'CBS This Morning,' " Sullivan said, in reference to the fact that Zahn had 
succeeded her as news anchor on "Good Morning America" and co-anchor of "ABC 
News This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ratings for "CBS This Morning" have improved recently, CBS is 
still in third place and, according to sources, decided to go after Zahn to try 
to move up further. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what we've accomplished here in the last 2 1/2 years," Sullivan 
said. "We've restored the credibility that said we meant business in the 
morning here at CBS." Co-anchor Harry Smith praised Sullivan, thanking her for 
"being such a great friend and a great teacher." 
</P>
<P>
There was clapping in the background from Sullivan's colleagues, who were with 
her taping the show from the Disney World facilities in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's contract with CBS runs until November. She said she intended to take 
a break and hopes to do "some really wild and wonderful things." Network 
sources have said that she might go to work in the CBS sports division.

RICK DU BROW: ABC NO. 1? THE DREAM EDGES TOWARD REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's as simple as ABC. From sunup to sundown, and into prime time, ABC 
Television is on the rise in both news and entertainment -- the network to 
watch as the 1990s get under way. 
</P>
<P>
Already cheered for such ventures as "Roseanne," "The Wonder Years" and "Twin 
Peaks," ABC is in fact cutting a much wider swath through the competition. Both 
its wake-up show, "Good Morning America," and Peter Jennings' evening wrap-up, 
"World News Tonight," have totally dominated the opposition on NBC and CBS 
since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
As TV's official ratings season ended this week, ABC was still second to NBC in 
prime time -- but it was also the only one of the Big Three networks that 
didn't experience an audience decline from the previous year. Its median viewer 
age, 37, was preferable to sponsors over those of NBC (40) and CBS (45). 
</P>
<P>
And ABC's dreams of toppling NBC in the next few years didn't seem so wild with 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" turning into a runaway hit and -- a big 
question mark -- Oprah Winfrey, the unbeatable daytime star, ready in the wings 
with her new series, "Brewster Place." It debuts on ABC during the May ratings 
sweeps that begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While ABC has a battle royal on its hands against NBC in prime time, it is 
simply running away from the competition in the prestigious races for 
morning-show and nightly news domination. "Good Morning America," already on 
the rise as last year drew to a close, was positioned perfectly to take the 
lead when NBC, in one of the dumbest executive decisions in TV memory, 
virtually forced Jane Pauley into resigning from the "Today" program by 
showcasing Deborah Norville as her obvious successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Today" now has lost to "Good Morning America" in the ratings every week this 
year -- in short, since Pauley quit and Norville replaced her. "Today" is also 
losing viewers steadily, and because of the incomprehensible move to break up a 
show that didn't need fixing in the first place, NBC reportedly is facing a 
drop in income from the series as well. 
</P>
<P>
With ABC's Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden comfortably in place as hosts of 
"Good Morning America," NBC and "Today" may need at least several years to win 
viewers over to the new team of Bryant Gumbel and Norville, if past patterns of 
this competition hold firm. And if Gumbel or Norville should leave "Today," it 
could take longer and make ABC's lead all the more secure. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening news competition, Jennings undoubtedly is benefitting from the 
fact that ABC's prime-time shows and overall reputation are stronger than those 
of last-place CBS, where his competitor, Dan Rather, has also suddenly 
plummeted from the lead. Furthermore, ABC's growing prestige as network TV's 
finest and deepest news organization -- with such other names as Ted Koppel, 
David Brinkley and Barbara Walters -- has certainly also helped Jennings surge 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening now is that ABC is seeing, on a vast scale, the 
coming-together of the efforts over the years of three executives who helped 
turn the network from a cellar-dwelling joke to an organization now poised to 
lord it over all of TV if it can finally unseat NBC in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
One of these executives, Roone Arledge, gave ABC the "Wide World of Sports" 
series three decades ago, "Monday Night Football" two decades ago and 
"Nightline" one decade ago. Arledge, who brought ABC a lasting identification 
with excellence in TV sports coverage -- "Monday Night Football" ranked No. 10 
among all shows in the season just ended -- was ridiculed and criticized when 
he also took over the network's news department and gave its nightly broadcasts 
a fresh look that was heavy on graphics and human interest. 
</P>
<P>
But he was no flake. Besides creating "Nightline," which evolved from coverage 
of the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran in 1979, Arledge built the news 
operation that now represents ABC, and he remains its president. His finest 
achievement will be celebrated Tuesday at 10 p.m. when ABC presents "The Best 
of 'Nightline' with Ted Koppel, 1980-1990." 
</P>
<P>
Another executive whose mark is clearly stamped on ABC is Brandon Stoddard, who 
turned the network's prime-time schedule into a place where viewers could look 
-- and now do -- for quality and experimentation on an ongoing basis. After 
enhancing ABC's image with such special programming as "The Day After," "The 
Winds of War" and "Something About Amelia," he helped bring about, as president 
of the network's entertainment division, series that included "Roseanne," 
"thirtysomething," "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Under another executive who helped turn ABC into a front-runner, former 
entertainment president Fred Silverman, the network actually bolted into the 
No. 1 position for the first time in the late 1970s. But while its shows 
included such notable hits as "Barney Miller," "Happy Days" and "Family," the 
tone of ABC's lineup was dominated by a barrage of lightheaded series like 
"Laverne &amp; Shirley," "Three's Company," "Charlie's Angels" and "The Love 
Boat." 
</P>
<P>
Silverman, who also helped bring forth "Good Morning America" -- an 
entertainment department series -- was a hero beyond compare at ABC, which for 
years before its prime-time ascension had been regarded with contempt and 
ridicule by its older, more established competitors, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But although ABC thus has been No. 1 before, its image at that time was hugely 
different from the one created by the team assembled under Stoddard, who now 
heads the network's in-house unit, ABC Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos," a project of ABC's new entertainment 
president, Robert Iger, is hardly the tone of "thirtysomething" and "The Wonder 
Years," but it is one of those fluky megahits that often propel a network to 
the top of the ratings. Curiously, its breakout success is reminiscent of the 
sudden, fad hits that marked ABC's earlier years -- "Batman," "77 Sunset 
Strip," "The Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
Imitations of "America's Funniest Home Videos" were expected, but some viewers 
must have been startled this week to see the following classified ad in The 
Times: "Shoot Your Family &amp; Friends . . . with your videocamera and KCBS 
will air them during the 11 p.m. Action News broadcast. Send us your funniest, 
most noteworthy video moments." 
</P>
<P>
America's funniest news? 
</P>
<P>
Despite ABC's success with "Home Videos," the network began this season with a 
series far more representative of its new creative mold -- a lovely and gritty 
drama called "Life Goes On," focusing on a teen-age boy with Down's syndrome. 
Iger has renewed it for fall. And then there was "Elvis," about the young Elvis 
Presley -- a stylish series that failed but enhanced ABC's reputation even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The network has so spoiled its viewers by doing the unusual that it may 
actually face a slip in reputation if it cancels two series still up in the air 
for renewal -- the Vietnam drama "China Beach" and the Jamie Lee Curtis-Richard 
Lewis sitcom "Anything But Love," a couple of shows with rare spunk for prime 
time and distinctive styles as well. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes Winfrey in "Brewster Place" as ABC once again offers an 
intriguing project -- a half-hour series set in a black inner-city community in 
1967. It will be launched May 1 and May 8 in the choice Tuesday time period 
following "Roseanne," then settle into its regular Wednesday slot May 9 at 9:30 
p.m. If Winfrey manages anywhere near the ratings clout she has on her daytime 
talk show, ABC could be off on another roll -- one that could help the network 
finally catch front-runner NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Competitively, it's been a fine season for ABC. It had four series in the Top 
10 -- "Roseanne," "America's Funniest Home Videos," "The Wonder Years" and 
"Monday Night Football." It also won three nights -- Monday, Tuesday and 
Friday. What's more, ABC is taking sharp aim at two opposition fortresses -- 
with "Videos" bringing down CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" and thus putting Sundays 
up for grabs, and the eccentric soap opera "Twin Peaks" at least providing 
contrast to NBC's Thursday lineup, dominated for six seasons by "The Cosby 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
From sunup to "Nightline," a wonder year indeed.

   CBS News made it official Tuesday, announcing
that former ABC anchorwoman Paula Zahn will succeed Kathleen
Sullivan as co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning'' starting Monday.
   CBS' formal announcement came after two weeks of news reports
that the move was pending. Sullivan indirectly confirmed the shift
during her farewell to viewers Friday. Her CBS contract expires in
November.
   Erik Sorenson, the program's executive producer, said today that
``it wasn't so much that we wanted to replace Kathleen as that we
wanted to get Paula Zahn. It was one of those judgment calls that
you make.''
   Sullivan, 36, was co-host of the show with Harry Smith since it
began in November 1987. Like Zahn, she was a morning news
anchorwoman at ABC before joining CBS.
   Sorenson said CBS officials were impressed with Zahn when she
recently filled in for Joan Lunden on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for a week.
   They called Zahn's agent to ask when her ABC News contract ended
and she'd be available for contract talks, he said. He quoted the
agent, Richard Leibner, as saying there were only eight days in
February when she'd be available.
   Sorenson said he and CBS News president David Burke spent three
days weighing the pros and cons of hiring Zahn, 33, ``and it was
not an easy decision because Kathleen is a helluva broadcaster.''
   However, he said in a phone interview, the show's ratings
``hadn't exactly been going through the roof'' and there was a need
to make a long-range decision for the show.

<HEAD>CBS Morning Show Gets New Executive Producer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``CBS This Morning,'' a perennial third in
morning-show ratings, is getting a new executive producer and its
current one is being promoted, CBS News said Friday.
   David Corvo will be succeeded as executive producer of both the
daily program and earlier ``CBS Morning News,'' by Erik Sorenson,
vice president and station manager of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los
Angeles.
   Corvo, who began his CBS career at KCBS-TV in 1975, was named
vice president for administration at CBS News by the division's
president, David Burke, who disclosed the changes in a statement.
   Burke said that Ted Savaglio, who holds the job Corvo will get,
and also is the network's deputy director of news coverage, will
become a senior producer at ``CBS This Morning.''
   Corvo has been executive producer of ``CBS This Morning,''
co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, since its
premiere on Nov. 30, 1987.
   It was the successor to ``The Morning Program,'' an
entertainment-oriented bid by CBS to boost morning ratings. That
show, with actress Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, was a
ratings flop and was dropped in 10 months.
   CBS News, which didn't produce that show, had hoped ``CBS This
Morning'' would slowly build an audience. But it has remained a
distant third in ratings.
   NBC News' established ``Today'' show, although reportedly
suffering internal troubles and speculation that co-anchor Jane
Pauley wants to leave, still leads in the ratings, followed by
``Good Morning America,'' produced by ABC's entertainment division.
    According to the most recent A.C. Nielsen Co. daytime ratings
``Today'' led with a 4.3 rating in the week ending Sept. 29. ABC's
show had a 3.9, and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.4. Each ratings point
now represents 921,000 homes.

<HEAD>Ratings Down for Morning Shows, But ABC Wins Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratings dropped for all three network morning
shows last week, but ABC's ``Good Morning America'' continued in
first, winning its 14th consecutive week, A.C. Nielsen Co. audience
estimates showed Thursday.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.5 rating, down 0.3 from the previous
week.
   NBC's once-dominant ``Today'' show, which fell into second place
after co-host Jane Pauley left at the end of last year, took the
biggest drop. It averaged a 3.3 compared with 3.8 the previous week.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained in a distant third, averaging a
2.4 rating, down one-tenth of a point from the week ending April 1.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   A ``Today'' spokeswoman, Mary Neagoy, attributed part of the
``Today'' drop to last week's national switch to daylight-saving
time. She said morning show ratings tend to go down initially when
the change occurs.
   Meanwhile, negotiations are still under way for a replacement
for ``Sunday Today'' co-anchor Maria Shriver, who left the show
last week. Mary Alice Williams is expected to succeed her.
   No announcement on Shriver's successor is expected until next
week, said Jerry Solomon, executive producer. He said Michelle
Gillen, a New York-based correspondent, would would co-anchor this
Sunday's ``Today.''

"So tell me, Sheila, your piece in Calendar today on 'Milk and Honey,' is it a 
typical, well-thought-out, well-written Sheila Benson movie review?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is." 
</P>
<P>
"Reads well, does it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Very well." 
</P>
<P>
"And some of the descriptions you use?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well intentioned . . . well acted . . . falls apart before its midpoint . . . 
atrocious upbeat ending in Jamaica." 
</P>
<P>
"Those are excellent descriptions to use. And the review's length?" 
</P>
<P>
"About 18 inches." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I see. Not only a good read, but a short one. And that's on Page 15 of 
today's Calendar section?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Page 15." 
</P>
<P>
"And you recommend that we all read your review?" 
</P>
<P>
"Very much so." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, always good reading you, pal. That's Page 15 today? We'll look for you 
in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
"You, too." 
</P>
<P>
If television devoted as much time to self-examination as self-promotion, its 
level of performance would improve dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Consider. If my above imaginary conversation with Times Film Critic Sheila 
Benson typically reflected even a small segment of newspaper content, most 
readers would revolt, after first falling apart with laughter over our 
pitifully transparent attempt to advertise and celebrate ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
But television -- like the chest-puffing politician who never stops running for 
office -- gets away with its behavior because it has spent years shaping 
different expectations, accustoming us to its excesses. Just as we say, "Oh, 
well, that's politics," we also say, "Oh, well, that's television." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that the Big Three networks are widening their promotional horizons 
to combat the ever-growing challenge from cable and videos. That does not mean, 
however, that they've abandoned making some promos the old-fashioned, deceptive 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Take Wednesday morning, for example. Take it and shove it. 
</P>
<P>
Here was an NBC "Today" show exclusive, the biggest out-and-out scoop since 
then-KNXT Channel 2 news in Los Angeles covered the 1981 wedding of its own top 
sportscaster at that time, Jim Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, "Today" could boast that no one else -- including its main competitors 
"Good Morning America" on ABC and "CBS News This Morning" -- had an interview 
with Maria Shriver about her documentary, "Fatal Addictions," which was airing 
that very night. 
</P>
<P>
That's Maria Shriver of NBC. That's "Fatal Addictions" on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
For much of TV, the addiction is self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The "Today" piece began with a lengthy clip from the documentary, followed by 
Bryant Gumbel's questioning of Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we gonna have some success stories tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"Success stories . . . and a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Gumbel ended it. 
</P>
<P>
"Always good seeing you, pal. Ten o'clock tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
You could live with this were "Today" also open to reporting about 
documentaries on opposing networks on the days they air. But don't hold your 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
It's no big flash, unfortunately, when news programs (the "Today" show is 
produced by NBC's news division) present self-promotion as news -- witness what 
happens on network morning shows and many local newscasts in ratings sweeps 
months. But it should be a big flash because it's a journalistic sell-out, a 
winking at ethics, a self-serving suspension of news standards. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, what occurs is a matter of an entertainment division having its 
will imposed on a news division. In Wednesday's case, it was a news division 
using itself to promote itself and one of its own: not only the documentary, 
but indirectly also the series Shriver stars on, "Sunday Today" and the new 
"Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Never has there been a medium so incestuously promotional as television. So it 
seemed almost routine to hear anchor Morton Dean end a news segment on 
Thursday's "Good Morning America" by vowing that an investigative story on the 
new ABC News series "PrimeTime Live" that night "should shock you." 
</P>
<P>
And in a space of about five minutes Wednesday morning, moreover, NBC viewers 
got a dose not only of Shriver, but also a KNBC Channel 4 news promo ("We get 
around . . ."), a promo applauding "L.A. Law's" Emmy nominations and a Maxwell 
House coffee commercial starring Linda Ellerbee and ever-mugging "Today" 
weathercaster Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Running this commercial within the "Today" time period risks the possibility of 
some viewers confusing the clowning Maxwell House Willard with the clowning 
"Today" Willard, a mix-up that NBC seems almost to be encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
But not its competitors. "Good Morning America" and "CBS This Morning" are 
running another version of the Maxwell House spot, one featuring only Ellerbee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "CBS This Morning" came up with a curious piece of its own 
Wednesday: Kathleen Sullivan interviewed the show's health specialist, Dr. 
Robert Arnot, and a woman named Nancy Hicks, who had nearly drowned in a 
river-rafting accident observed by Arnot while taping a "CBS This Morning" 
segment on rafting. 
</P>
<P>
How is it that this obscure incident became a story on "CBS This Morning"? 
Because the show had footage of Arnot helping others revive Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
Would this have made the "CBS This Morning" lineup had the footage showed NBC's 
Shriver helping save Hicks? No. In that case you would have seen it on the 
"Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
Always good seeing you, pal.

   ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' TV's bright
new ``infotainment'' package, neither informs nor entertains and
blows past at the speed of a video game.
   It's ``nuzak'' _ something that looks like news at a distance
but will drive you crazy if you try to pay attention.
   At the end of the ride the viewer might only remember a bromide
such as ``baseball is baseball, even in Russia,'' or feel a gnawing
need to know more about the ``sound-emitting chair that provides
the equivalent of eight hours sleep in just 20 minutes.''
   Factoids are dispensed in the ``snapshots'' which precede the
commercials: 6,500 limousines were sold in the USA in 1985; it
costs 49 cents to mail a letter in Italy, 25 cents in the USA.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' is the first informational
series from Grant Tinker, whose GTG Entertainment production studio
is a joint venture with Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, the
newspaper. The syndicated, nightly half-hour news show premiered
last Monday on about 160 stations. In most markets, it airs in the
early evening.
   Jay Leno has joked that USA Today is the newspaper for those
whose attention span is too short for television.
   ``USA Today'' on television is no marathon for the mind, but it
demands intense attention in short bursts. For instance, viewers
have about five seconds to decode an elaborate weather map. RAIN,
the map said Tuesday. Where?
   OK, if you care about the weather you can watch the local news,
but then what's the point of flashing the map on ``USA Today''? Is
this the art appreciation segment?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SNAPSHOT: Second helpings of ``USA Today'' in the USA (A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings Tuesday compared to Monday): Washington, down
14 percent; Los Angeles, down 28 percent; Chicago, down 9 percent;
Denver, up 24 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes ``USA Today'' is goofily inspired, especially in the
first show when Robin Young stood inside an Impressionist painting
and then, apparently walking toward a fan that made her hair
billow, melded into a beach scene from the film, ``A Man and a
Woman.''
   Edie Magnus played more tricks on the mind by doing ``live''
interviews with George Bush and Michael Dukakis, after explaining
neither one was in the studio. She stood and chatted with a screen,
synchronizing her questions to answers taped earlier in the day.
   The implicit message is that nothing is real, not here anyway.
Nor is anything so important that you, the viewer, need to think
about it.
   But why watch? It takes less concentration to watch ``Nova'' or
a Bill Moyers special on PBS.
   If you miss the intro to a segment, forget it. Poor sound
quality in some of the interviews doesn't help either. In a segment
Wednesday on the National Geographic, voices were repeatedly
smothered by annoying music.
   Before ``USA Today'' hit the air, it suffered a certain amount
of sniping from critics because of its commitment to an upbeat
``journalism of hope'' which accentuated the positive and
eliminated the negative.
   What's been accentuated is pace; coherence and content have been
eliminated. You have to give up something to jam 18 topics into the
22 minutes left after commercials.
   But it's not as though ``USA Today'' tracked mud through the
temple of television. CBS' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th'' have
blazed a trail for lightweight journalism, ABC's ``20-20'' is
infatuated with celebrities and Fox's ``A Current Affair'' and
``The Reporters'' plumb the lower depths of taste. ``USA Today''
looks less like an innovator than a cross between Trivial Pursuit
and ``Entertainment Tonight.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   NO `TODAY' TODAY _ For the first time in its 37-year history,
NBC's ``Today'' show is being pre-empted, beginning today, for
coverage of the Summer Olympics in Seoul. But ``Today'' fans won't
miss the stars of the morning show. Bryant Gumbel is anchoring
NBC's prime-time coverage of the Olympics, and Jane Pauley will be
on hand for coverage in the mornings, along with weatherman Willard
Scott. ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and ``CBS This Morning,''
meanwhile, are looking to pick up some viewers without competition
from the No. 1 ``Today'' for a couple of weeks. ...
   ALL-STAR CAST _ Brian Dennehy, Michael Tucker, Hume Cronyn,
Richard Dysart, Hal Holbrook, John Houseman, Barnard Hughes, David
Ogden Stiers and David Straithern have been cast in Aaron
Spelling's made-for-TV movie, ``Day One,'' about the events that
led to the production and dropping of the first atomic bomb on
Hiroshima, Japan. The movie is based on the book by Peter Wyden and
has begun filming for presentation on CBS next season.

   NBC's slumping ``Today'' Show, trying to recover
during the important May ratings ``sweeps,'' will go camping in
Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains on May 21-22.
   Co-hosts Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville, and weatherman
Willard Scott will do the show from a campsite at the Delaware
Water Gap National Recreational Area near Shawnee, Pa.
   NBC earlier announced that ``Today'' would broadcast from Boston
on Monday and Tuesday, and from outdoor New York locations the rest
of the week.
   ABC's top-rated ``Good Morning America'' plans to broadcast from
England, Scotland and Ireland for the next two weeks, and ``CBS
This Morning'' will originate next week from Europe, starting
Monday in Florence, Italy.
   The ``Today'' camping announcement on Thursday came as the show,
which two weeks ago week suffered its lowest ratings in seven
years, got slightly lower ratings in the week ended April 27,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' won the morning ratings race for
the 17th consecutive week, averaging a 4.3 rating. ``Today'' was
again in second, averaging as 3.2 rating, one-tenth of a point
lower than the previous week.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained in third place with a 2.6 rating.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
