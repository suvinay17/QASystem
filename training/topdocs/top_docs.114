   The Grinch was pinched from a hotel display, giving
the storybook character a taste of his own medicine.
   The downtown Quality Inn has put up an eggnog reward for
information leading to the return of the lanky larcener.
   ``We're missing a 6-foot green Grinch. AWOL in Boston,'' Jeff
Hilary, manager of the downtown Quality Inn said Friday.
   No leads turned up Friday, although Hilary said an ice carver
would be bringing in an ice sculpture of the cold-hearted Grinch to
replace the missing statue.
   Police were aiding in the search for the statue, said department
spokesman Jim Jordan.
   ``We have a report of stolen property, a 6-foot papier-mache
statue from the famous Dr. Seuss children's story,'' he said. ``We
have no information as to its whereabouts.''
   Hilary said the theft was detected early Thursday after a party
in a hotel ballroom where the Grinch was on display.
   ``There can't be that many gangly green Grinches wandering around
Boston,'' Hilary said. ``He's quite tall _ got a Christmas hat on.''
   The Grinch was part of a Christmas display worth about $800,
Hilary said. Thieves left the sleigh on which the Grinch had perched.
   According to the children's story by Dr. Seuss, ``The Grinch That
Stole Christmas,'' the dour green character makes off with a town's
Christmas decorations and presents after becoming enraged by the
sounds of Christmas cheer. But the Grinch relents and returns the
booty to Whoville.
   Hilary said hotel staff hope the heist is the work of a prankster
who will decide to restore the decoration.
   ``We're offering a reward of a substantial amount of eggnog for
anybody with information leading to the reapprehension of our
friend,'' he said. ``I don't know what the insurance company's going
to say about it.''

<HEADLINE>  GRINCH NOT GUILTY, S.F. JUDGE RULES
'CHRISTMAS DOESN'T COME FROM STORE'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The tongue-in-cheek Court of Historical Review &amp; Appeals heard the case of
"The Grinch who Stole Christmas," the holiday story written by the late Dr.
Seuss. The Grinch, still pasty green with a mischievous grin, testified on his
own behalf.;   "I've been Seussed," he claimed.;   In the end, it was the
Grinch who prevailed. Municipal Judge George T. Choppelas found the Grinch not
guilty of charges of breaking and entering, grand theft and trespassing
because the statute of limitations for those crimes had passed.;   Choppelas
also found the Grinch not guilty of stealing Christmas, borrowing as his
inspiration a quote from the book: "Christmas doesn't come from a store.
Christmas means a little bit more."  </TEXT>

   Thieves broke into a church's storage
room, picked through almost 2,000 toys that were donated for the
poor and made off with the best of them, authorities said.
   ``What they took was the new stuffed animals, the doll babies,
the trucks,'' said Barbara Zahner, executive director of Sacred
Heart Church's Community Services. ``They left us the used toys.''
   The toy giveaway Monday is aimed at helping boost the morale of
poor parents. The 1,000 parents who registered for it can browse
through the storage room to make their selections, and receive
wrapping paper and ribbons to decorate the packages.
   ``The idea is they can come and shop with dignity,'' Zahner said
Friday. ``There's no money exchanged, but they can choose.''
   The storage room is in a building used by at least seven social
service agencies. Zahner said two men were seen walking down the
hall with full plastic garbage bags Thursday night, but no one paid
much attention to them.
   There were no signs of forced entry, so Zahner said she suspects
the thieves may have had a key to the building.
   The giveaway is still set for Monday.
   ``We'll just count on the goodness of people who realize that
this is the season of the child,'' Zahner said.

   A man working as a shopping mall
Santa Claus was arrested on charges that he fondled teen-age girls
while they were having their pictures taken with him.
   Police said Donald Strong, 44, of Crawfordsville was charged
Thursday with sexual battery after he allegedly fondled the young
women, aged 15, 16, 17 and 18, at Boulevard Mall.
   Mall manager Kevin B. Garleb said Strong has previous convictions
on burlgary and theft charges. He would not comment on the sexual
battery charges, but defended his hiring of Strong.
   ``Past charges of burglary do not mean that you would be a
possible threat for a sexual crime,'' Garleb said.
   Detective Lt. Rick D. Wilson said Strong was arrested while he
was off duty.
   The young women did not report the alleged fondlings, but a
policeman overheard other shoppers talking about the allegations.
   ``I think there were several reasons why they did not report the
incidents immediately. Like victims of other sexual crimes, they
were afraid of the embarrassment and publicity,'' Wilson said.

   Only the most ruthless of robbers would steal the
Grinch who stole Christmas.
   But steal him they did _ until their consciences caught up with
them.
   A pair of Northeastern University students who identified
themselves only as Ebenezer Scrooge and Kriss Kringle on Saturday
returned the 6-foot green Grinch they had pinched two days earlier
from Boston's downtown Quality Inn.
   ``Initially we were going to hold the Grinch for a large
ransom,'' the pair said in a note they left along with the
well-loved hater of Christmas. ``But ... we decided to return the
Grinch hoping the Quality Inn would donate $100 to the charity of
your choice in the names of myself and my partner and the Grinch.''
   Hotel spokeswoman Doris Pike said all was forgiven and that plans
were in the works to donate the money to Camp Joy, a recreational
therapy group for children with special needs.
   ``We threw a party today for about 65 kids from the group,'' Ms.
Pike said. ``They missed out on the Grinch, so they get the money.''
   According to the children's storybook by Dr. Seuss, ``The Grinch
That Stole Christmas,'' the dour green character makes off with a
town's Christmas decorations and presents after becoming enraged by
the sounds of Christmas cheer. But the Grinch relents and returns

<LEADPARA>  MAKING HOUSECALLS: Theodor Geisel, a.k.a. "Dr. Seuss," died last week at age
87, after publishing 47 books in a career spanning more than half a century.
Many of his wonderful, wacky works were converted to cartoons over the years,
and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Doctor even created a couple of items
specifically for film.;   Here is a checklist of his inspired insanity

FAMOUS AUTHOR OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS LEFT A LEGACY OF

<TEXT>     He wrote and illustrated 47 books, selling more than 100 million copies in
18 languages. He was awarded a 1984 Pulitzer Prize for his contribution to
children's literature.;   His works seemed like journeys into nonsense,
magical worlds of truffula trees, green eggs and ham, ziffs and zuffs and
nerkles and nerds, where top-hatted cats run rampant through youngsters' homes
while goldfish scold.;   But they often included subtle messages on issues
important to him, from internationalism to environmentalism.;   When asked two
weeks ago whether he had any final message, a valedictory, Geisel told the San
Diego Union: "Whenever things go a bit sour in a job I'm doing, I always tell
myself: 'You can do better than this.' The best slogan I can think of to leave
with the U.S.A. would be: 'We can do and we've got to do better than this.' ";
  In his 1984 best-seller, "The Butter Battle Book," Geisel offered a parable
for the atomic age. It chronicled the escalating arms race between the Yooks,
who eat their bread butter side down, and the Zooks, who do just the
opposite.;   It ends with the two sides at the Yook-Zook border, each armed
with the ultimate weapon -- a Big-Boy Boomeroo bomb.;   A boy asks his
grandpa, "Who's going to drop it. Will you? Will he?";   "Be patient," grandpa
says. "We'll see. We will see.";   Geisel was childless himself -- after his
first wife's death in 1967, he married Audrey Stone Diamond, a mother of two
-- but had an unrivaled gift for delighting children.;   "You make 'em; I
amuse 'em," he said.;   Born March 2, 1904, in Springfield, Mass., son of a
brewer who ran a zoo for a time during Prohibition, Geisel graduated in 1925
from Dartmouth, where he drew cartoons for the humor magazine, Jack-O-Lantern.
He later studied in England and drifted to Paris, where he mingled with Lost
Generation writers such as Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein.; 
 He returned to the United States in 1927 to marry Helen Palmer and to pursue
his hope of being a novelist. But the Great Depression forced him to put the
great American novel on hold, and he went to work writing two-line gags for
Judge and Life, both humor magazines at the time.;   It was on a spoof of
scientific developments that he first used the name that would become his
trademark. He added "Dr." to his middle name to sound more scientific.;   "I
wrote my first children's book because my exclusive contract forbade me from
doing virtually anything else in the world," he said. That book was ". . . And
to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," penned on a ship crossing the
Atlantic. He said that the words, strung together in the sing-song style that
became his trademark, were written to the rhythm of the ship's engine.;  
"Mulberry Street" was published in 1937, the same year as his first adult
novel, "The Seven Lady Godivas." The children's book, rejected by 27
publishers before being accepted by Vanguard Press, became a spectacular
success. His novel was a commercial dud.;   Children liked his writing because
he treated them as equals, Geisel often said. His illustrations were another
matter. His creatures often looked like stuffed animals missing much of their
sawdust.;   Through the 1950s, he wrote a couple of children's books a year,
capped in 1957 by the publication of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas and "The
Cat in the Hat.";   "Grinch," made into a cartoon with Boris Karloff reading
the title role, was a stark critique of the commercialism that had befallen
Christmas, a 20th century version of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol.";   "The Cat
in the Hat" revolutionized children's reading habits.;   "That is what I am
proudest of; that I had something to do with getting rid of Dick and Jane,"
Geisel said in 1982.;   Of all his books, though, "The Lorax" was his
favorite.;   Written in 1971, "The Lorax" was about a brown mossy creature who
tries in vain to protect the truffula trees from the Onceler, who chops them
down with abandon to make "thneeds." Then one day, relates the Onceler, "all
that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky was my big empty factory, the Lorax
and I.";   Geisel ended the environmental saga, however, with a message of
hope to his readers -- a single truffula tree seed survived.;   Geisel is
survived by his wife, Audrey, two stepdaughters, Lea and Lark, his niece,
Peggy Owens, and her son Theodore Owens, of Los Angeles.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Hundreds of Needy People Left Empty-Handed By Theft of Food Packages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of needy people were turned away
empty-handed from a community center after a real-life Grinch stole
thousands of dollars worth of food, toys and clothing collected for
a traditional Christmas Eve giveaway.
   Volunteer workers at the Paul Hall Community Services Center
were distributing whatever food and toys were left by burglars who
broke into a storage shed early Sunday morning, said Willie Hall,
director of the center.
   ``We did distribute about 400 food baskets today, but we had to
turn away about 300-400 people this afternoon,'' Hall said.
   ``People were very distressed, but they did understand the
problems. We assured them we are doing the best we can to try to
get some food to accommodate them.''
   The center also had planned to distribute toys to about 1,000
children Christmas Eve, but there were only enough toys left for
500 children, Hall said.
   Frank Campbell, a spokesman for the center, said the theft
disappointed many of the needy _ some of whom had been waiting in
freezing temperatures as early as 7 a.m. for the afternoon
distribution.
   ``Some Grinch came in and stole Christmas for these kids,''
Campbell said. ``Our main goal was to supply a nice meal for people
who are poor and homeless throughout the city.''
   The thieves also stole train sets, remote-controlled cars and
other toys donated by local businesses, Hall said.
   The burglars must have been prepared for the theft, Campbell
said, because in four hours they stole several hundred 10-pound
turkeys, hams and chickens as well as several hundred toys.
   Campbell said he didn't know the exact value of the items taken
because most were donated, but estimated at least $3,000 worth of
property had been taken.
   As news about the theft spread, hundreds of people came to the
South Side center throughout the afternoon and evening to donate
hams, turkeys and canned goods, Hall said.
   He said organizers planned to distribute food baskets today to
those who were turned away.
   ``The theft did kill the Christmas spirit earlier, but people
have come throughout the day to show the Christmas spirit,'' Hall
said. ``Hundreds of people in the Chicago area have come ... to
help us out in our plight.''
   Police were working to find the culprit or culprits, said
Officer John Crotty.
   ``We're not looking for anything from these (burglars),''
Campbell said. ``What we would like is whoever broke in today to
bring the food back.''
   The community center, originally called the Paul Hall Boys Club,
was founded in the 1960s by the Rev. Paul J. Hall, who gained
national attention for his efforts to help poor youngsters and
their families through such projects as Christmas food giveaways.

they worked for five years to build the new park.;   "It's a terrible world,

 "This is a community park, and even though the tree hadn't been there very

the tree is in the living room of someone who passed through Clarksburg in the

tree for someone's home," Campbell said.;   The park would have cost about
$100,000, Campbell said, but instead was about $45,000 because so much effort
was donated by residents of the town of 350 along the Sacramento River 10
miles south of Sacramento.  </TEXT>

HOW TO HAVE YOURSELF A MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S LITTLE CHRISTMAS

<P>
THE LANGUAGE of Christmas has hardly changed since Chaucer's time. That's 
because the essence of this holiday is tradition and change is resisted. We 
have carols and wassail and Christmas trees and the exchange of gifts, and 
nobody wants it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then we see a pink Christmas tree, and it is probably plastic, but such 
trifling innovations don't change the spirit of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
According to Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the words 
Christmas, yule, wreath, mistletoe, holiday, holly and angels date from before 
the 12th Century. Carol, Xmas and wassail are also many centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
The word Christmas itself comes from the Old English word Christes maesse, 
which literally means Christ's Mass, and it is celebrated throughout the 
Christian world on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
During the first few centuries of the church, however, it was celebrated on 
various days in January, April, May, September and October, because the early 
theologians disagreed on Christ's birth date. Finally, in AD 340, the Pope 
settled on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's sets to rest a common misconception about the word Xmas, which is 
often thought of as a sort of sacrilegious, modern, shortcut slang word for 
Christmas. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
The word Xmas has perfectly good credentials. The X in Xmas is a symbol for 
Christ from the Greek letter chi, the first letter of Christos. A chi looks 
much like our X, and the word Xmas has been in use since 1551. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it still looks like slang to me. 
</P>
<P>
Yule, another word that means Christmas, also dates from before the 12th 
Century and is related to the Old Norse word jol, which originally meant a 
pagan winter feast. Yuletide first appeared in English during the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
To "troll the ancient yuletide carols" is a tradition that dates to the singing 
of the "heavenly host" of angels on the first Christmas day: "Glory to God in 
the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." 
</P>
<P>
Carol comes from the late Latin choraula, meaning choral song; it dates in 
English from the 14th Century. Troll means to sing, and comes from the 15th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
To go a-wassailing is to sing carols from house to house. Originally wassail 
was an Old Norse toast -- ves heill, meaning "be well." From that term came the 
name of the cheerful holiday concoction made of wine, beer, cider, spices and 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Few words have been added to the Christmas lexicon in recent centuries, but 
Scrooge -- a name we get from the born-again miser of Charles Dickens' beloved 
story, "A Christmas Carol" -- is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Even more recently, the word grinch has become popular. A grinch is 
anill-tempered cynic invented by Dr. Seuss in his children's book, "The Grinch 
Who Stole Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Decking the halls with leaves of holly originated among the ancient converted 
Danes. They believed that holly was used for the crown of thorns at the 
Crucifixion, and that the red berries represented drops of blood. 
</P>
<P>
The use of mistletoe goes back to the pagan Druids. It is a parasite that grows 
on apple and oak trees. Druid priests made a solemn rite of collecting it from 
oak trees. People paid them for pieces of the plant, believing that it kept 
witches away. 
</P>
<P>
The present notion that strangers may kiss under its aura is much more benign. 
(If the Druids were right, one is not in danger of kissing a witch.) 
</P>
<P>
As for Santa Claus, that name is a corruption (through the Dutch Sinter Claes) 
of Saint Nicholas, a 4th-Century bishop of Myra, in ancient Lycia (Turkey), who 
was much beloved of children and sailors for his alleged miracles in their 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
How this hazy figure became the jolly fat man who drives reindeer through the 
sky, squeezes down chimneys and leaves toys for children in millions of homes 
at Christmas is beyond my learning. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I don't believe in him, and I don't think parents should con their 
children into believing in him, either. 
</P>
<P>
Children with normal intelligence will soon figure out that the old fellow is a 
fraud, and they will never trust their parents again. 
</P>
<P>
This breach of faith at an age when children are entirely dependent on the 
parents for their perception of truth and reality can never be mended. 
</P>

THE MAN WHO MADE READING A GLEEFUL GAME  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>      Who? Dr. Seuss, that's who.;   Oh, my. Whimsy went out of the world.;  
Theodor Seuss Geisel was the writer-illustrator who stole -- and kept -- the
hearts of three generations of children.; He was 87 when he died about 10 p.m.
at his home in La Jolla, his family at his bedside. He had been suffering from
a jawbone infection that had become acute in recent months, said Jerry
Harrison, who oversees Random House Books for Young Readers, Geisel's longtime
publishers.;   From his first Dr. Seuss book in 1937 to his 47th last year,
Geisel made "Read to me" the most important part of the day for millions of
children, when Mommy or Daddy or Grandpa or Sis opened the cover on the world
of Horton, Yertle, the Lorax or the Grinch.;   Barbara Bush, whose cause as
First Lady has been improving literacy, knew that well when she said
Wednesday: "All of us are grateful for the laughter and the love shared by
parents and children every time we read one of Dr. Seuss's classic tales
together.";   Perhaps the most famous was "The Cat in the Hat," but readers
the world over might name "Horton Hatches the Egg," "Yertle the Turtle" or
"Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?" along with a smile and the part they had
memorized as a child -- or adult. More than 200 million copies of his books
were sold. They; were translated into 20 languages.;   "If you asked people
today to name one children's author, I'd venture it would probably be Dr.
Seuss," said Julie Cummins, the New York Public Library's coordinator of
children's services.;   Geisel's 48th book, "Six by Seuss," was a collection
of his own favorites -- "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," "The
500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins," "The Lorax," "Horton Hears a Who!" "Yertle
the Turtle" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas.";   Many felt the archetypal
Seuss hero was Horton, the conscientious pachyderm who was duped by a lazy
bird into sitting on her egg. Horton stuck to the job for many weeks, despite
dreadful weather and other harassments, saying, "I meant what I said and I
said what I meant; an elephant's faithful 100 percent.";   Conversely, the
Grinch became the universal villain, and Geisel's television production about
his awful deeds made him even more reprehensible. "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas!" and "Horton Hears a Who!" both won TV's Peabody Award. Geisel was
also awarded a 1984 Pulitzer Prize for his contribution to children's
literature.;   Geisel was an illustrator first and writer second. He'd tack
his drawings onto the corkboard of his studio walls in storyboard fashion,
muse over them and then write the accompanying couplets. Sometimes an
illustrated story line would befuddle him for two years before he could marry
it to words; other times, he'd crank out his verses in just a few days.;   "If
all our authors were as he was, we wouldn't need editors," said Janet
Schulman, his editor at Random House. "Occasionally he'd give us a rhyme that
was a little off, or a word that might not work. He'd think about it and
sometimes he'd change it -- but usually he wouldn't, and that was fine.;  
"There will never be another Ted Geisel.";   Friends said Geisel painstakingly
separated his social life from his work -- a self-disciplined 9:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. job where he would sequester himself in a studio that provided him
with a 180-degree view of the Pacific coastline, from Mexico to Oceanside.;  
But what linked Seuss and Geisel was humor.;   "He never . . . told jokes, but
he's funnier and more spontaneous than anyone I've ever known," said close
friend and fellow-author Jeanne Jones. "If he had the inclination, he could
have been the world's greatest stand-up comic.";   But if Geisel enjoyed
entertaining his friends, he took perhaps his greatest satisfaction in helping
introduce a new order to traditional children's literature.;   In an interview
in 1984, Geisel pulled off the shelf "The Riverside Reader," a dusty,
dog-eared primer he used in 1909 when he was in the first grade. As he turned
the pages, he pointed out the dull passages and mundane story line.;   "I
wanted to get rid of primers like this," he said. "I feel my greatest
accomplishment was getting rid of Dick and Jane, and encouraging students to
approach reading as a pleasure, not a chore.";   Geisel was born and grew up
in Springfield, Mass., and attended Dartmouth. He contributed cartoons to the
campus humor magazine, Jack-O'-Lantern, and became its editor. He graduated
with a bachelor's degree in English in 1925. Then followed a year of graduate
work in English literature at Lincoln College of Oxford University, after
which he spent a year traveling in Europe.;   In 1927, Geisel married Helen
Marion Palmer of Orange, N.J., a teacher he had met when they were studying at
Oxford. It was she who persuaded him to give up thoughts of teaching and make
drawing a career.;   "Ted's notebooks were always filled with these fabulous
animals," she later recalled. "So I set to work diverting him; here was a man
who could draw such pictures; he should be earning a living doing that.";  
Geisel was childless himself -- after Helen's death in 1967, he married Audrey
Stone Dimond, a mother of two -- but had an unrivaled gift for delighting
children.;   "You make 'em, I amuse 'em," he once said.;   Geisel had a full
career "writing for adults" before he began writing Dr. Seuss books full time.
He was a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM, and during World
War II was attached to Frank Capra's documentary film-making unit.;   After
writing and directing indoctrination movies for American troops, he won an
Oscar for best documentary short for a troop film that was released after the
war by Warner Bros. Geisel won another Academy Award in 1947 for "Design of
Death," a documentary film about Japanese warlords. He won a third Oscar in
1951 for an animated cartoon -- "Gerald McBoing-Boing." Many of the techniques
Geisel learned in Hollywood were useful when he began writing children's
books.;   Geisel began using his middle name as a pen name for his cartoons
because he hoped to use his surname as a novelist one day. But when he got
around to doing a grown-up book -- "The Seven Lady Godivas" in 1939 --
grown-ups did not seem to want to buy his humor, and he went back to writing
for children, becoming famous and wealthy.;   "I'd rather write for kids," he
later explained. "They're more appreciative; adults are obsolete children, and
the hell with them.";   When asked two weeks ago whether he had any final
message, Geisel told the San Diego Tribune: "Whenever things go a bit sour in
a job I'm doing, I always tell myself: 'You can do better than this.' The best
slogan I can think of to leave with the U.S.A. would be: 'We can do and we've
got to do better than this.' "  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The Grinches who stole Victor Diaz's van were
too busy guzzling two six-packs of beer he left on a front seat to
notice a load of Christmas toys in the back worth more than $500.
   ``My jaws dropped when I saw the toys in there,'' Diaz said
Wednesday. ``Every hair on my body went up. The officer said, `This
never happens.'''
   He had worried his family's Christmas was ruined after the van
was stolen from their driveway Monday night.
   But the only things missing when he found the van in suburban
Pacoima the next day were 12 beers, a set of wrenches, a small
stool-like table and pink bunny purse belonging to Diaz's daughter.
   Diaz had spent two hours at a toy store Monday night, buying
gifts for his four children, ages 3 to 12. He said he spent $564.
He planned to hide the toys in the garage after the childre were
asleep.
   But when he went out around 11 p.m., the van was gone.

<TEXT>     The cat in the hat, the Lorax and Horton the elephant are part of our
common cultural heritage. The Grinch is as infamous a spoiler of Christmas as
Scrooge.;   Dr. Seuss' books combine whimsical happenings, wordplay, and
curious drawings to entertain children and teach basic moral lessons: Live
peacefully, "The Butter Battle Book." Respect and preserve nature, "The
Lorax." Be forthright and steadfast, "I mean what I said and I said what I
meant. An elephant's faithful 100 percent," said Horton in "Horton Hatches the
Egg." Trust your own experiences, the message of "Horton Hears a Who." Above
all, have fun with words and imagination.;   Only Charles Schulz, creator of
"Peanuts," ranks with Seuss in bringing to life the wisdom and humor of
innocence.;   Such was Geisel's effect on children's books that he became an
education reformer. With "The Cat in the Hat" and other books for beginning
readers, Seuss wrote books to help children learn to read.;   His novel
approach, which slowly won the acceptance of educators, was giving children
books with simple words that were fun to read. Compare "The Cat in the Hat" to
being tortured by Dick, Jane and Spot.;   "That is what I am proudest of; that
I had something to do with getting rid of Dick and Jane," Geisel said in
1982.;   It is hard to stay sad about the death of Theodore Geisel, because he
invented so many antidotes for the poison of sadness.;   Says the cat in the
hat:;   I know today's wet;   And the sun's lost its sunny.;   But we could
have;   Lots of good fun that is funny.;   And we do, whenever we think of Dr.
Seuss.  </TEXT>

'LORAX' SURVIVES AX, STILL ON READING LIST; 
</P>
<P>
AUDIENCE CHEERS LAYTONVILLE SCHOOL BOARD DECISION TO KEEP BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The school board of a tiny Northern California logging town has unanimously 
voted to continue requiring its second graders to read a Dr. Seuss book that 
two prominent local families charge is a thinly veiled attack on the timber 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a flood of television lights and national press attention, the Laytonville 
School Board rejected the request to remove from its second grade core reading 
list "The Lorax," a 1971 book about a fuzzy-headed creature who fights a 
fruitless battle against the devastation of a make-believe forest. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was greeted by thunderous applause from the more than 200 
onlookers and students who jammed the cafeteria of the elementary school in 
this town 150 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Author 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Seuss is the pen name of Theodor Seuss Geisel of La Jolla, who for decades 
has charmed young readers with his rhyming whimsy. He is the author of more 
than 40 books such as "The Cat in the Hat" and "How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Judith Bailey, the wife of a wealthy Laytonville lumber supplier, 
petitioned the board to remove "The Lorax" from the required reading list, 
instead making it alternative reading. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing controversy struck at the growing tension in Laytonville between 
established logging families and newcomers from urban areas, many of whom 
believe Northern California's forests are a precious commodity and should be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compared to Book Burning 
</P>
<P>
Some residents claimed the loggers' actions were tantamount to book burning. 
Others snickered that the woodsmen wanted to "Ax the Lorax, lynch the Grinch." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, school board President William Webster spoke of the divided 
community when he opened the meeting by quipping, "Welcome to 'Family Feud.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later -- time that included sometimes heated remarks from board and 
community members alike -- Webster summed up the board's sentiments to a chorus 
of appreciative hoots and hollers. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to go into the classroom . . . to say which book you can teach . . . is 
about as appropriate as a group of teachers going into the woods" to decide 
which trees to cut down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exercise in power and ignorance and futility. We are insulting our 
children -- who do we think we are kidding? We are telling these children 'We 
need to protect you from certain ideas.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's in conflict with everything the United States stands for. Let's let the 
teachers teach. Let's let the students learn." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers believed the loggers' efforts were a dangerous strike at their 
professional integrity. Their numbers included teachers' association members 
from as far away as the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
At first, things did not look good for either "The Lorax" or the concept of a 
core reading list for second graders as board members discussed alternatives 
for the book -- talk that included moving it to the core literature list for 
seventh graders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Ordered 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the board voted to keep the book on the reading list but assigned 
School Supt. Brian Buckley to review the use of core and extended literature 
lists as part of the district's language arts curriculum and report back at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, parents who object to any literary work used in the classroom 
can ask for a comparable book to be used by their child, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Burgess, a Laytonville high school senior, told the board, however, 
that the town's children at least had no problem with the book. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of students polled said they wanted to keep the book on the 
reading list, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One angry parent told the board that if the book went, he would take his two 
children out of the public school.

Mail-Order Grinch</HL>

<TEXT>
   With fewer than 70 shopping days till Christmas, millions of Americans are avoiding long lines, bad weather and crowded parking lots by doing some or all of their Christmas shopping by mail. 
Many people find mail order more convenient and sometimes cheaper, since state sales taxes aren't charged if the recipient is out-of-state. 
But if Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has his way, mail-order firms will have to collect sales taxes on all their transactions. 
The House Ways and Means Committee will vote on his bill next month. 
If it passes it will be just in time to give consumers an unwelcome holiday present. 

   Mail-order and direct-marketing sales are booming. 
Interstate sales top $100 billion a year and represent as much as 14% of all retail business. 

   Rep. Dorgan's bill would cost mailorder consumers up to $1.5 billion. 
Several business groups support the measure; they argue that the companies that send tax-free merchandise through the mails are unfair competition for local retailers. 
Mail-order firms respond that the Dorgan bill would impose enormous compliance costs. 

   L.L. Bean, a catalog store in Freeport, Maine, claims that just printing the different tax rates and exemptions in its catalog would cost $10 million a year. 
Studies indicate it costs direct marketers three to 10 times as much money to collect sales taxes as it does for retail companies. 
The 45 states and 7,000 localities with sales taxes have never agreed on a coordinated plan of collection, so the only way to enforce payment of mail-order taxes is to allow dozens of different auditors to inspect catalog companies' books. 

   In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that states would violate the Constitution's commerce clause if they levied a sales tax on out-of-state retailers that had no presence in the state beyond advertising. 
Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, Rep. Dorgan wants Congress to define what a minimum business presence in a state is in a way that allows out-of-state sellers to be taxed. 

   But even if that argument is upheld by the Supreme Court, taxing mail-order firms may also violate the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment because the firms being taxed won't benefit from state government activities. 
The Treasury Department is concerned about the bill because it would require the Internal Revenue Service to share sales-tax data filed by merchants with state tax collectors, thus inviting public suspicion about the confidentiality of federal tax returns. 

   Retail merchants that back the Dorgan bill, such as J.C. Penney, are correct in saying that mail-order companies are at a competitive advantage in not having to charge sales taxes, which can range as high as 9%. 
But that isn't an argument for creating an enforcement nightmare that could drive some mail-order merchants out of business. 
It is an argument for states to consider reducing any sales taxes that are so high that they induce people to shop out-of-state for goods. 

   In Dr. Seuss's tale, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," a dour figure swept down on Whoville and made off with all of the Christmas presents in the town. 
But, in the true spirit of the season, the inhabitants celebrated anyway. 
Christmas would also still be the same if Rep. Dorgan's bill passes, but that is no reason to make consumer goods more expensive for people by chasing their dollars across state lines and slapping a constitutionally dubious tax on them.

<TEXT>
   The Grinch began the Christmas season
almost as early as retailers this year, stealing a load of trees
from the Boy Scouts.
   Thieves stole 180 bundled Christmas trees from a parking lot
Wednesday. Independence Boy Scout Troop 747 had planned to begin
selling the trees on Friday and use the proceeds to send its
members to camp next summer.
   ``We're just sick at heart,'' said Debbie Camerlynck, the
director of the scouts' Christmas tree project and mother of one of
the scouts.
   The trees were bought for $4,200, she said.
   A witness said two men loaded the trees into a pickup and drove
off. Police said the thieves must have made several trips to steal
the 180 trees.

<HEAD>Family Christmas Tree Chopped Down by Grinch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every Christmas season for 15 years,
the Hernandez family adorned the pine tree on their front lawn with
garland, tinsel and more than 200 festive ornaments.
   That is until a Grinch chopped it down and made off with the
12-foot Monterey pine that had become a neighborhood landmark.
   On Wednesday, Ricardo Hernandez walked out the front door and
saw only a stump with pine needles scattered about. The 36-year-old
welder took to the trail of needles like a hunter takes to
footprints in the snow.
   The path eventually led to an apartment complex, where Hernandez
found his tree sitting on a porch.
   But the Grinch didn't live there.
   ``It was some old man with six kids,'' Hernandez said Thursday.
``He said he had bought the tree a little earlier for $7 from a
wino.''
   Hernandez didn't have the heart to take the tree back to his
distraught family.
   ``The kids were upset that somebody could steal a Christmas
tree,'' Hernandez said. ``I tried to convince them that they
couldn't steal the Christmas spirit. I tried to tell them that they
can steal a tree, but not the spirit.''
   Police say they are looking for the tree chopper.
   Neighbors who have looked forward every year to seeing the
brightly decorated tree joined in the family grief.
   ``It's awful. Especially at this time of year, and to steal that
kind of thing,'' Luis Frias said. ``Everybody around here is real
depressed.''

   The Grinch who stole Ricardo
Hernandez's Christmas tree couldn't steal Southern California's
Christmas spirit.
   Hernandez walked outside one day last week and found that
someone had chopped down the 12-foot-tall pine tree growing in his
front yard that the family had decorated every Christmas for the
past 15 years.
   On Friday, he walked out and found that someone had planted a
new one, standing 7 feet tall.
   And, thanks to actor Richard Dreyfuss' wife, Jeramie, the
children in the neighborhood have Christmas toys.
   Hernandez thought he was on the trail of the first tree's thief
when he tracked its scattered needles from his house to a nearby
apartment. But the apartment's occupants turned out to be a poor
family who had thought they had gotten a good deal on a Christmas
tree.
   ``It was some old man with six kids,'' Hernandez said. ``He said
he had bought the tree a little earlier for $7 from a wino.''
   Hernandez didn't have the heart to take the tree back.
   But word of the incident spread.
   Then Mrs. Dreyfuss arrived with a carload of gifts. She had
included gifts for the three Hernandez children, for the six
children whose porch now houses the tree and for other youngsters
in the neighborhood.
   ``The kids were upset that somebody could steal a Christmas
tree,'' Hernandez said. ``I tried to convince them that they
couldn't steal the Christmas spirit.''

   Was it an invader from outer space?
   Joe Hendricks said he was in the crawl space of his home to do
some wiring when he spotted a heart-shaped, grayish mass hanging
about 3 feet from the low boards overhead. It was about a yard at
its widest point and roughly 16 inches deep with streaks of colors
that almost seemed to pulsate.
   ``I turned around and saw that and I thought, `what in the name
of God is that,''' he remarked. ``I thought it was a blob from
outer space.
   ``It really scared the living daylights out of me.''
   A closer look, and one or two stings, revealed it to be an
unusually large wasp nest.
   ``It's one of the biggest ones I've ever seen,'' said Lyle E.
Klostermeyer, owner of Lyle's Entomological Service in Walla Walla.

VIDEO DISCOVERIES: HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT MARSH, Robert Marsh is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the advent of video, my friends and I have gathered in an annual 
endurance test of holiday cheer. We have thrown Christmas Movie Marathons. 
</P>
<P>
After raiding a video store or two, we sit back for 24 hours or so, basking in 
the season. Some people may want to split their viewing over several weeknights 
or even a few weekends, but those who manage to sit straight through everything 
will find it a wonderful sensation. As the films flicker by, the marathoner may 
feel his or her heart grow to two or three times its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
First, there are the television specials (yeah, I know I said movie marathon 
but Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without a few of these TV classics now 
available on video. Try shuffling them up and watching them between the real 
movies). 
</P>
<P>
This year, several specials directed by the inimitable team of Arthur Rankin 
Jr. and Jules Bass have been released for sale and rental. "The Little Drummer 
Boy" is a charming little piece that may remind one of the sometimes forgotten 
role played at Christmas by the baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
And what would the holidays be without "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"? This 
Rankin and Bass tale is narrated by a Burl Ives snowman and features many 
holiday tunes. Such fun characters as prospecting Yukon Cornelius and a 
bouncing Abominable Snowman highlight this tale of misfits in search of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin and Bass' "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" finds Fred Astaire narrating 
the story of Santa, letting us know just who he is and how he came to be. More 
toe-tapping tunes and endearing characters lace this favorite. (Incidentally, 
if Hollywood is listening, "The Year Without a Santa Claus," the 
rarely-televised story about the year when Santa couldn't deliver toys because 
of the worst blizzard in history, should be released on video. The singing and 
dancing Heat Miser is sorely missed.) 
</P>
<P>
"A Very Merry Cricket" is a wonderful animated special written and directed by 
Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame. It tells the tale of a cricket who brings 
Times Square to a halt with his Christmas caroling. Jones' best-known 
directorial effort is the quintessential Christmas TV special, "How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas," written by Dr. Suess and narrated by Boris Karloff. My group 
continually promises to save this one for the end of the marathon, as sort of 
its crowning glory, but none of us can ever wait that long to see it. 
</P>
<P>
And, just as we need to see the Grinch carve the roast beast, we need to hear 
Linus' soulful telling of the Christmas Story, and to watch Charlie Brown 
rescue a forgotten little Christmas tree, and to hear the Peanuts' gang's 
rendition of "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" in "A Charlie Brown Christmas." If 
you've only got one hour for Christmas viewing, Charlie Brown and the Grinch 
can fill it with decades worth of Christmas memories and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Onto the movies! John Hughes' "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" is a good 
starting point even though it is a Thanksgiving film. Steve Martin is trying to 
get home to spend the holiday with his family. The hazards of the road and John 
Candy get in his way, and make for an exceptional film loaded with laughs and 
laced with a human warmth that should bring a lump to the heartiest throat. 
</P>
<P>
A good follow-up is "Miracle on 34th Street," the version that stars Edmund 
Gwenn as the bearded gent who must convince a very young Natalie Wood -- and a 
courtroom -- that he truly is the real Santa. (Again, you should only invite 
people to your marathon who will not mind displays of emotion. Both movies 
listed so far, and most that follow, are guaranto teed tear-wellers). 
</P>
<P>
For a change of a pace, you might want to add "The Nutcracker," especially the 
lavish American Ballet Theatre production that features Mikhail Baryshnikov as 
both star and choreographer. The National Philharmonic's spirited rendition of 
Tchaikovsky's score rounds out this excellent choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you wish to delve further down the fantasy path, try "March of the Wooden 
Soldiers." This 1934 film with Laurel and Hardy is the original "Babes in 
Toyland" and is far superior to the Disney remake (with Annette Funicello and 
Tommy Sands) that most people rent unwittingly. Although this film includes 
some tunes that are far from exciting, Laurel and Hardy are great fun as the 
toy maker's assistants who must save the storybook town. 
</P>
<P>
"A Christmas Carol" is a must, but which version? I recommend the 1951 
black-and-white one with Alastair Sim as Scrooge. It is well written and the 
acting is superb, on top of which you don't have to listen to Albert Finney 
sing. And Dickens' bleak world plays best in black and white, as a place of 
shadow and light. (You may want to consider before renting that this film is 
for sale at just slightly more than the rental fee. It makes an excellent 
addition to a home library and even comes in a specially priced gift package 
with the next film in our marathon: "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
For many people, this classic is at the top of the Christmas film list. If you 
have not yet enjoyed the tale of Jimmy Stewart taking a peek at what the world 
would have been like had he never been born, what are you waiting for?!? There 
is a colorized version, but avoid it like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the black-and-white vein, "The Bishop's Wife" stars Cary Grant as an 
angel who attempts to reconcile David Niven's stagnating marriage by making 
moves on Niven's wife. Both funny and touching, it'll leave you smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bells of Saint Mary's" is the exceptional sequel to the Academy 
Award-winning "Going My Way." Bing Crosby, returning to his role as a 
modern-minded priest, finds himself at a parochial school butting heads with 
Ingrid Bergman's Mother Superior. It's a delightful film with many warm 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday Inn" finds Crosby and Fred Astaire singing, dancing and fighting over 
women. It also marks the first appearance of Irving Berlin's classic "White 
Christmas" (later reprised in a film named after the song and again featuring 
Crosby, this time with sidekick Danny Kaye). If you're a Bing fan, "Holiday 
Inn" is a must. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas in Connecticut" is a screwball comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck as a 
newspaper columnist whom people turn to for advice in family matters. The 
problem is that she's not the Susie Homemaker type she pretends to be; she's 
really tough and streetwise. For the sake of publicity (and her job), she has 
to find house and husband for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the '40s and into the '80s with "Ernest Saves Christmas." Yes, an Ernest 
film. I admit to being a fan, but even non-Ernest fans might love this one, a 
very funny story about Ernest's efforts to help an old Santa pass on his 
gift-giving skills to an overweight children's show host. Even though you may 
not entirely buy the borderline, maudlin runaway-girl subplot, this is still a 
film that should make you say, "Hey! It's Christmas . . . and I like it!" 
</P>
<P>
There's more Christmas comedy from John Hughes in "National Lampoon's Christmas 
Vacation" as Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald, the consummate family man 
trying to have a real family Christmas. Naturally, nothing goes right. From his 
harpy in-laws to the unexpected arrival of rural cousin Randy Quaid, Chevy's 
Christmas takes one downward slide after another. 
</P>
<P>
A true gem is "A Christmas Story," with Peter Billingsley (better known as 
Messy Marvin) as a boy who wants a Red Ryder air gun for Christmas. He schemes 
diligently to get one, only to hear from everyone -- including a department 
store Santa -- that he'll shoot his eye out. It's a charming, nostalgic look at 
youth and a bygone era. Darren McGavin plays the boy's father with a 
delightfully silly quality. If you haven't saved the Grinch or "It's a 
Wonderful Life" for last, you might want to consider "A Christmas Story" as the 
crown of your marathon. 
</P>
<P>
A very funny version of the "Christmas Carol" tale is Richard Donner's 
"Scrooged," with Bill Murray as a practically soulless television executive who 
receives the ghostly visitations of Christmas Past, Present and Future. How can 
you not like a movie that proposes a television special entitled "The Night the 
Reindeer Died" complete with explosions and Lee Majors? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there'll be a new addition to my group's marathon this year: "Die 
Hard." Yes, the Bruce Willis action flick about a lone New York cop up against 
a gang of ruthless, bloodthirsty burglars. Aside from the bullets and blood, 
you see, it's a film about a man trying to win his family back. He's come to 
Los Angeles to spend Christmas with them. Some people will argue for "Lethal 
Weapon" on the same grounds: It, too, takes place in the holiday season. Mel 
Gibson must learn to overcome the death of his wife, people get shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One last note: for the truly warped, there is a film called "Silent Night, 
Deadly Night," which finds Santa running around chopping people up with an ax. 
This one has the distinction of having had its ads pulled from television 
because they were scaring little children and it most likely will not be in my 
group's marathon.

It's easy to make this a video holiday season. Christmas videos for children 
can be inexpensive and the great majority are animated. 
</P>
<P>
Many are put together poorly with lazy animation and silly songs. There are, 
however, some grand exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
Mickey's Christmas Carol (Disney tape and disc) has become a perennial 
favorite. It is a clever adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic retelling 
the story of Ebenezer Scrooge in amusing Disney terms: Scrooge McDuck (who 
else?) is the repentant miser; Mickey Mouse is Bob Cratchit; Goofy is Marley's 
Ghost; Black Pete is the Spirit of Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong making it a Disney video Christmas. Very Merry Christmas 
Songs (Disney tape) is a genuine crowd pleaser with Mickey and the gang singing 
12 holiday favorites including "Deck the Halls" and "The 12 Days of Christmas." 
Other Disney releases include A Disney Christmas Gift, a collection of Yuletide 
scenes from a variety of Disney's animated classics; Jiminy Cricket's 
Christmas, a celebration with Pinocchio's pint-sized conscience and his friends 
(including Mickey, Peter Pan and Snow White), and A Walt Disney Christmas, six 
vintage Disney cartoons including "The Night Before Christmas" and "Pluto's 
Christmas Tree." 
</P>
<P>
After Disney's classic animation, everything seems to go downhill, although 
some may prefer the bite of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a 
faithful adaptation of the children's classic (MGM/UA tape). 
</P>
<P>
There's also a collection of seven classic cartoons from the 1930s and '40s 
called Christmas Comes but Once a Year (Shokus tape, less than $13), including 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." A vintage 1952 "Howdy Doody" TV program, in 
which Howdy and Clarabell rescue Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, is an added 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Don't dismiss other feature-length cartoons because the animation seems 
amateurish next to the Disney product. Some are worth your children's time: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (Paramount tape) is an unexpectedly superior 
adaptation of the Dickens tale with an original musical score by Jule Styne. 
This animated special should keep you and your children satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
George and the Christmas Star (Paramount tape) is an amusing story about a 
lonely man who wants to get a star out of the sky for his Christmas tree and 
comes back with a lot more than that, including the gift of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
A Charlie Brown Christmas (HiTops tape) is one of the popular TV productions 
based on Charles Schulz's cartoon strip. Poor Charlie Brown will make any child 
feel good about being him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas on Sesame Street (Random House tape) Big Bird, Bert, Ernie and the 
rest of the gang offer intelligent commentary, and there is a surprisingly 
moving adaptation of O'Henry's classic Christmas story "The Gift of the Magi." 
</P>
<P>
You're on your own with many animated specials featuring familiar cartoon 
characters (listed below). Only choose them if your children are particular 
fans of the character. Forget any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Casper's First Christmas" (Worldvision tape) has the friendly ghost joined by 
Yogi Bear, Boo Boo and Huckleberry Hound; "The Berenstein Bears' Christmas 
Tree" (Nelson tape) is typical stuff with Papa Bear trying to find the perfect 
tree; "Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Great Santa Claus Caper" (MPI tape); 
"B.C.-A Special Christmas" (Nelson tape) lives up to the cartoon strip's 
potential; "Glo Friends Save Christmas" (Vestron tape) is pretty routine stuff 
only for those who bought the toys featured in the made-for-TV special; 
"Christmas Comes to Pac-Land" (Goodtimes) has Pac-Man helping Santa Claus; 
"Rudolph's and Frosty's Christmas in July," "Frosty's Winter Wonderland and the 
Leprechaun's Gold" and "Rudolph's Shiny New Year" (Lightning Vestron tape) 
feature the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Snowman in pretty silly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other animated videos: "Silent Night" and "The Night Before Christmas" with the 
voices of the Obendorf Boys Choir (Media tape); "Pinocchio's Christmas" 
(Vestron tape) features the voice of Alan King; "Christmastime for Teddy 
Bears," a read-along video musical; "A Star for Jeremy" (Lorimar tape) explains 
why there is a star at the top of Christmas trees; "Snow White Christmas" 
(Prism tape) brings back a poorly animated Snow White who battles a poorly 
animated Evil -ueen so the kingdom can have a Merry Christmas; Calvin, Santa's 
elf, stars in "Santa's Christmas Elf" (United Entertainment tape); "A Christmas 
Tree" and "Puss-'n'-Boots" (Prism tape) and "Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny" 
(United Entertainment tape) are more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for the perfect Christmas present, one that reaffirms the 
closeness of family in the best holiday tradition, then there is really only 
one to choose: A Child's Christmas in Wales (Vestron tape). This is a 
sensitive, intelligent rendering of the Dylan Thomas memoir of a Christmas Eve 
spent with parents and grandfather. Denholm Elliott is a perfect guide, and the 
cast captures Thomas' words and memories with special grace and tender ness. 
It's a home video present for the entire family to view during the holidays 
because it affirms values of family, love and the spirit of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Another live-action Christmas video is Shari's Christmas Concert (Fries tape). 
This is a one-woman tour de force by ventriloquist Shari Lewis (with an 
important assist from puppet Lamb Chop). If adults sometimes believe that Lewis 
seems at times to suffer from a terminal case of cuteness, children still adore 
her. JOE SALTZMAN

   When Charles Dickens wrote ``A Christmas Carol''
in 1843, he had no way of knowing that his simple truths would
provide creative fodder for filmmakers, animators, lyricists and
playwrights for generations to come.
   Many holiday-themed movies take their cue from Dickens'
wonderful story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his change of heart.
   Here is an alphabetical list of some, but certainly not all, of
some holiday-spiced videos for the Thanksgiving-Christmas-New Year
season. Many are versions of ``A Christmas Carol'':
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   - ``Alice's Restaurant'' (1969): It's the Thanksgiving Dinner
that couldn't be beat, and the generation that just said ``no'' to
the draft. From Arlo Guthrie's song.
   - ``Auntie Mame'' (1958): Christmas despair leads to Christmas
joy and a new marriage for Auntie Mame in this delightful romp.
   - ``Babes in Toyland'' (1961): A terrible Disney version (if
there is such a thing) of the Victor Herbert operetta, starring
Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands and Ray Bolger.
   - ``The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas'' (1983): Animated
story about a bear who skips hibernation to find out what Christmas
is all about. Not bad, but certainly not great.
   - ``Caspar's First Christmas'' (1987): Any parent who inflicts
this dud on a kid should be arrested for child abuse. Horrible
animation and terrible Caspar voice (it's not the one in the
original Caspar the Friendly Ghost cartoons) help make it
unbearable.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' (1965): If you ever wondered
what CHristmas was all about, wonder no more. A magical treat from
the Peanuts characters.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving'' (1973): Linus explains the
true meaning of Thanksgiving. Another Peanuts gem.
   - ``A Child's Christmas in Wales'' (1987): Dylan Thomas'
wonderful story, somewhat lamely done.
   - ``A Christmas CArol'' (1938): A compassionate look at Scrooge,
starring Reginald Owen and GEne Lockhart.
   - ``A Christmas Carol'' (1951): The better version, with often
scary sequences. Stars Alastair Sim as a more broken and evil
Scrooge, whose transformation is all the more poignant.
   - ``Christmas in Connecticut'' (1945): A phony family for an
advice columnist. FAst-paced fun, starring Barbara Stanwyck and
Sydney Greenstreet.
   - ``Christmas Lilies of the Field'' (1984): Sequel to Academy
Award-winning movie that starred Sidney Poitier. This one is rather
Lame, but has its heart in the right place. Stars Billy Dee
Williams.
   - ``A Christmas Story'' (1983): Jean Shepard's marvelous memory
of Christmas in the 1940s and the ultimate gift, a regulation Red
Ryder air rifle.
   - ``A Disney Christmas Gift'' (1982): A real treat. The best of
Disney, with special holiday shorts.
   - ``Dr. Seuss: Horton Hears a Who''; ``The Grinch Who Stole
Christmas'' (1974): Made-for-television animated shorts from the
cartoon master himself, Chuck JOnes.
   - ``A Dream for Christmas'' (1973): A minister moves to
California to start a new church. A slice of American pie, but not
as tasty. Stars Hari Rhodes and BEah Richards.
   - ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' (1988): Ernest P. Worrell, that
down-home obnoxious TV pitchman, helps Santa. You have to be a true
Ernest fan for this one.
   - ``Happy New Year, Charlie Brown'' (1985): That old gang again.
And great as always.
   - ``Holiday Inn'' (1942): With music by Irving Berlin, and
memorable performances by Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, who could
go wrong?
   - ``It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946): Frank Capra's black and
white marvel, starring JAmes Stewart as the man who made the wrong
wish and was saved from it.
   - ``March of the Wooden Soldiers'' (1934): Wonderful fantasy
feature starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who save the land of
Old King Cole from the horrible boogeymen.
   - ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944): Family entertainment from
Judy Garland, Margaret O'Brien and Tom Drake.
   - ``Mickey's Christmas Carol'' (1984): That resourceful little
rodent plays Bob CRatchit in this spin of the Dickens' classic.
   - ``Miracle on 34th Street'' (1947): Do you believe in Santa
Claus? A delightful tale, starring NAtalie Wood.
   - ``Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol'' (1962): The near-sighted one
plays Scrooge.
   - ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (and Other Wonderful
Christmas Stories)'' (1944): Four animated featurettes. All black
and white, and all classics.
   - ``Santa Claus - The Movie'' (1985): Dudley Moore plays an elf
in this enjoyable film. How fitting.
   - ``Night and Day'' (1946): CAry Grant portrays Cole Porter.
   - ``The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1975): A British-made version of
``Scrooge,'' the musical adaptation of ``A Christmas Carol.'' This
one is pretty good. Stars Anthony Newly and David Hemmings.
   - ``Scrooge'' (1970): Musical of Dickens tale. Stars Albert
Finney and Alec Guiness.
   - ``Scrooged'' (1988): One of the more disastrous versions of
the Dickens story. Saved by CArol Kane as the ghost of Christmas
Present. Stars Bill Murray doing his usual.
hilarious, as is the entire movie. Co-stars Eddie Murphy, Ralph
Bellamy, Don AMeche and Jamie Lee Curtis.
   - ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' (1945): A sentimental portrait of
a working class family - in Brooklyn.
   - ``White Christmas'' (1954): AN inferior redo of ``Holiday
Inn,'' but it makes good use of the title song. Stars Bing Crosby
again.

   The grinch that stole Christmas from a local
child this week also had a few beers and bologna sandwiches.
   Billy Felingiere told police someone broke through a rear window
of his apartment between 3:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. Monday.
   The intruder ate several bologna sandwiches, drank three 16-ounce
beers and left through the front door.
   The only other thing stolen was a child's Splish-Splash set from
beneath the Christmas tree.
   ``Burglary is not baloney,'' mused police Sgt. Steve Haines.
``But we suspect a hungry and thirsty thief who likes Bobby Darin
music.''
   Darin recorded the 1950s hit, ``Splish, Splash.''

   Police didn't catch the Grinch, so they
played Santa instead.
   Christmas Day dawned dark and awful for Neona and Dan Calovich
when they returned from her parents' home to find a thief had
kicked in a door to their house.
   The home was ransacked. Thieves even took gifts placed under the
Christmas tree for the couple's two young sons.
   But then officers, dispatchers, jailers and other police
employees arrived bearing gifts.
   ``It has been a very emotion-filled day, a most overwhelmingly
happy Christmas,'' Mrs. Calovich said.
   Officer David Gilgour, who had taken the family's burglary
report, thought of the couple's sons, ages 3 and 18 months, and of
his own 4-year-old boy.
   ``I know how hurt he'd be without any presents,'' Gilgour said.
``And how I would feel myself if I couldn't provide a Christmas for
him.''
   Gilgour radioed police dispatcher Jane Smitka and suggested the
department help the family. By the time he returned to the station,
teddy bears, toy trucks and cars, turkeys, cash and other gifts
were pouring in.
   ``The stuff came from their individual homes,'' police Capt. Don
Huntsinger said. ``In some cases, I suspect, from their own
Christmases.''

<TEXT>  Today is your day.; You're off to Great Places!; You're off and away!; From
"Oh, the Places You'll Go!"; by Dr. Seuss, 1990, Random House; THEODOR Seuss
Geisel sent millions off to great places in five decades of fanciful
storytelling. Forays into a house stained pink by the antics of a cat in a
hat, trips into a jungle where an elephant named Horton hatches an egg, visits
into a town where a Grinch steals Christmas . . .;   And despite Geisel's
death on Tuesday, the tongue-twisting tales of this literary trail-blazer will
no doubt delight generations to come.;   "He's constantly popular," says
Cherry Lyon, owner of the If Wishes Were Horses bookstore in Palo Alto. "His
books are classics. People want to buy them for their kids because they
enjoyed them as children.";   "He was really a pioneer," says Betsy Hearne,
editor of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books at the University of
Chicago. "He brought a lot of levity to children's literature. That was his
great gift."; (hbox);   You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.; 
 You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.; (hbox);   Geisel's
books were not always highly thought of by the literary establishment. Geisel
once said his first book, "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," was
rejected by 28 publishing houses because it was too different from other
children's books then on the market.;   "He went through a long period of
being a bit condescended to by the children's-literature critical
establishment," says John Donovan, president of the Children's Book Council, a
New York-based national trade association of children's book publishers. "For
a long time, there was a kind of dismissive view of him because he was too
popular . . . and because his vocabulary was so simple. But as time has worn
on, they've done a complete about-face.";   Susan Denniston, in charge of
children's services for the Sunnyvale Public Library, credits Geisel for being
one of the first to bring causes such as ecological awareness to children.;  
" 'The Lorax,' which is about the felling of trees, was written at the
beginning of the environmental movement," she says of the book first published
in 1971.;   Lyon, owner of If Wishes Were Horses, agrees that Geisel's
strength was delivering important messages in a light-hearted, even silly,
way. But she says other Dr. Seuss books were great as first readers.;   " 'Hop
on Pop' is terrific for teaching reading," she says. "The words rhyme, the
type is big, and the pictures are very descriptive of what the words are
saying. It teaches reading in a very fun way."; (hbox);   I'm sorry to say so;
  but, sadly, it's true;   that Bang-ups;   and Hang-ups;   can happen to
you.; (hbox);   Even Geisel's fans admit that not all his works were
masterpieces. "The Butter Battle Book," an anti-nuclear-war fable, is often
criticized for being too heavy-handed.;   Others have criticized the
cartoonish artwork, with glob-like, goofy creatures that might seem scary to
young children.;   But Shirley Skellenger, a children's librarian at San
Jose's main library, says most kids enjoy the trademark Seuss surreal images,
the plays on words, the constant repetition.;   Of course, part of Geisel's
success lay in his ability to enthrall adult readers as well as youngsters.
Those interviewed say Dr. Seuss -- ever popular for half a century -- no doubt
will be remembered for sending anyone who was willing off to great places.;
(hbox);   And will you succeed?;   Yes! You will, indeed!;   (98 and 3/4

   The grinch didn't steal Christmas, just
the decorations on mailboxes in a neighborhood here.
   ``It's not so much the value, it's just the time that went into
it,'' said C.J. Redmond, who lives in the Cherokee Village
subdivision.
   A small, ceramic Santa Claus that Redmond and his wife, Louise,
had used for their children nearly 40 years ago was one of the
decorations yanked from their mailbox.
   Thieves struck Sunday night or early Monday, snatching bows,
candy canes and other trinkets decorating mailboxes and trees,
police said.
   ``Instead of being angry about it, you get sick. The whole
neighborhood is trying to ... show camaraderie,'' said Judy Petty,
whose candy canes and red bows were stolen.
   Decorating mailboxes for Christmas was the idea of the Cherokee
Village Garden Club, a member said. The neighborhood mail carrier
was to have judged the decorations this week.

<HEAD>Ralph Bakshi Says `Tattertown' Began with High School Doodling</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nick at Nite, the cable channel that has
revived old sitcoms for prime time, is getting its own new cartoon
series.
   But Ralph Bakshi's ``Tattertown'' will fit right in _ it's about
discarded objects that come to life.
   Bakshi said the concept of ``Tattertown'' began as doodling in
high school.
   ``It's been in development for 25 years,'' Bakshi declared.
``It's my monster. It started in high school as a comic strip. It
was an excuse to make fun of who we are by the objects we throw
away. `Tattertown' is a world where everything we once owned comes
alive.''
   ``Tattertown'' debuts Wednesday on Nick at Night with a Christmas
special that introduces Debbie and her stuffed doll Muffit.
   Debbie is the only human in a world where inanimate objects come
to life. Muffit becomes the evil ruler of this magical world, while
Debbie struggles to bring her back to the real world.
   Thirty-nine additional half-hour episodes will be shown on Nick
at Nite in 1989 and 1990.
   ``It's nostalgic, with cartoons and stuff from the 1920s and
'30s,'' said Bakshi, who is best known for such adult animated
features as ``Fritz the Cat,'' ``Heavy Traffic,'' ``Coonskin,''
``The Lord of the Rings'' and ``American Pop.'' He also produces
``Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' for CBS.
   ``Tattertown,'' he said, ``has a kind of 1926 style to it. This
is my first true-to-life thing for kids. My other cartoons were more
for adults. It's my first step into Disney's world of wholesome
stuff for kids. Still, I think adults will like the nostalgia of it.
   ``It won't be as satiric as `Mighty Mouse.' I think kids will see
those wonderful toys running around. I think they'll get it. You
can't talk down to them. We'll have three kinds of music. Paul
Whiteman white-bread music, Duke Ellington sophisticated jazz and
hot jazz like Fats Waller and Fletcher Henderson.''
   Bakshi was in his cramped studios located in what looks like an
old motel in Van Nuys. Drawings were pinned all over the walls, and
every inch of space was taken up with animators working on the
celluloid frames.
   One of his directors, Maurice Noble, worked on ``Snow White'' for
Walt Disney and on various cartoons at Warner Bros.
   Bakshi said he was approached by Nick at Nite after he completed
work on ``Mighty Mouse.''
   About half the animation will be done at his studios and the rest
overseas. ``We do more animation here than most companies,'' he
said. ``We do all the key posing and timing. Besides, my motto is if
you don't have animators around who can you yell at?''
   Bakshi grew up wanting to become another Al Capp, creator of the
newspaper comic strip ``Li'l Abner.''
   At the age of 21 he became the youngest animator in the business
at Terrytoons. He was soon promoted to director and at 24 was the
studio's creative director.
   On the side he drew ``Fearless Fosdick'' sequences for Capp's
``Li'l Abner.'' He made numerous attempts to start his own comic
strip, but he was turned down by all the syndicates.
   ``I quit Terrytoons and started my own studio when I was about
27,'' he said. ``I didn't know what I was doing. The first thing I
did was `Fritz the Cat.'''
   ``Fritz'' got an ``X'' rating when it was released in 1972. It
attracted a lot of attention, and Bakshi picked up a reputation as
rebel.
   ``I'm just an artist who runs a studio and tries to uphold the
rights of artists,'' he said. ``I'm not a rebel. I've had a lot of
troubles. I just want my freedom of speech. I want to be able to
express myself. I just want to do my job. `Fritz' was a great
cartoon. `Heavy Traffic' was better.''
   He leaned back in his chair. ``I'm not a rebel,'' he said. ``I've
mellowed out.''
   Bakshi will also produce and direct an animated special based on
Dr. Seuss' ``The Butter Battle Book.'' Ted Geisel, who writes under
the name of Dr. Seuss, is writing the script and lyrics for the
songs. Chuck Jones, who directed the Peabody Award-winning Seuss
classic ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' will be a consultant.

   Elsewhere in television:
   STAYING SOBER _ The anti-alcohol campaign by the Harvard School
of Public Health has been enthusiastically adopted by the television
industry, according to communications director Jay Winsten. Public
service spots against drunk driving are being telecast during the
holiday season. Many series are now writing anti-alcohol dialogue
into their scripts. Scenes showing drinking will have a word of
caution and mention the need for a ``designated driver'' who has not
been drinking.

<TEXT>
   `Tis the season for human folly, or, as the sign in the New York
City bus depot puts it: ``The holidays are here. PLEASE! Watch your
belongings.''
   With that in mind, we present our nominations for the 1989
Ebenezer Scrooge Awards, given just this once to those who best
exemplify the seamy underside of the Christmas spirit.
   These are nominations only; there will be no winners. As will
become appallingly obvious, everybody loses.
   For Worst Performance by a Santa, the nominees are:
   _ The Santa in sunglasses who held up a branch of Fidelity Bank
in West Chester, Pa., while softly singing, ``We wish you a merry
Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas.'' Santa, whose
performance was captured by the bank's surveillance camera,
pocketed $1,000.
   _ The macho Santa who beat up a heckler in front of a crowd of
children in Salvador, Brazil. The heckler reportedly had shouted,
``How about giving me your mother as a present this Christmas,
Santa?'' Santa was arrested after attacking him, but proudly told
police, ``I gave that bum what he deserved.''
   _ The elderly Santa in Lowell, Ark., who made off with cash from
a convenience store after threatening to pour hot coffee on the
clerk.
   For Worst Treatment of a Santa, the nominees are:
   _ Either the employees, the custmers, or both, at the Capital
Plaza Mall, in suburban Landover, Md. A black Santa at the mall
quit after complaining of harassment by co-workers who thought
Santa had to be white. The mall management blamed customers, black
and white, who ``expressed concerns with having a black Santa
Claus.'' The mall later issued a public apology and asked Santa to
come back.
   _ The Marshalltown Mall in Marshalltown, Iowa, which fired a
female Santa because she was _ you guessed it _ female. ``Parents
tell children that Santa Claus is a man, and the mall tries to get
as close to that image as possible,'' mall manager Scott Ball
explained. The mall told Ms. Claus, 28-year-old Tammy Medberry,
that she could go to work as an elf.
   _ The boy from New Zealand whose letter to Santa contained a
bomb threat. Either Santa brings a computer, the child wrote, or
the chimney goes kaboom.
   For the Best or Worst Performance by a Grinch, Depending on How
You Look at It, the nominees are:
   _ Whoever took the nativity scene from Ann Webb's front yard in
Pinetops, N.C. The only thing left was the North Star, still
hanging from a pine tree. ``When I saw what happened,'' Ms. Webb
remarked later, ``I said, `I hope Santa Claus doesn't come to see
them.''' She apparently hadn't heard about the Santa from Brazil.
   _ The burglar who stole more than $1,000 worth of toys from the
Salvation Army in Lufkin, Texas.
   _ The man, described as a ``wino,'' who chopped down the
Hernandez family's live Christmas tree in front of their house in
Inglewood, Calif., and sold it to an unsuspecting neighbor for $7.
``It's awful,'' said another neighbor, Luis Frias. ``Especially at
this time of year, and to steal that kind of thing. Everybody
around here is real depressed.''
   The envelope? Burn it, please.

COMMUNITY AT LOGGERHEADS OVER A BOOK BY DR. SEUSS

<P>
There's a little tale about trees that's quickly become required reading all 
across timber-laden Mendocino County -- not just in the classroom, but in the 
coffee shops and service station waiting rooms as well. 
</P>
<P>
It's not about the stately redwood, the towering symbol of a once-thriving 
economy in this depressed lumber town of about 900 residents -- a place without 
even one traffic light, a mere eyeblink along U.S. 101, about 150 miles north 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The fascination is with the bright-colored Truffula trees, the imaginary plants 
that play a major role in "The Lorax," a 1971 book by Dr. Seuss, the children's 
author from La Jolla who for decades has charmed young readers with his rhyming 
whimsy about green eggs and ham and cats with hats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Run on 'The Lorax' 
</P>
<P>
Folks here say you can't find the book anywhere within 100 miles, that you have 
to drive clear up to Eureka to find a bookstore that hasn't already been 
cleaned out. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a run on 'The Lorax' all across the county, that's certainly safe 
to say," said Marianne Loeser, president of the Long Valley teachers' 
association in Laytonville. 
</P>
<P>
The critical reviews started this fall when two prominent logging families 
complained that the book -- which for a year has been required reading for 
second-graders in the 570-student Laytonville Unified School District -- was a 
thinly veiled attack on the lumber industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, a mossy, mole-like creature named a Lorax fights a fruitless 
battle against the ax-wielding, water-fouling Once-ler family, which wreaks 
environmental havoc on a make-believe forest by greedily harvesting all of its 
Truffula trees to make a multipurpose stocking called a Thneed. 
</P>
<P>
The fuzzy-headed Lorax suddenly disappears, presumably at the hand of greed, 
after the Once-lers -- "with a sickening smack of an ax on a tree" -- cut down 
the last Truffula. The book ends, however, on an upbeat note as the remaining 
Once-ler asks that a seed from the last tree be planted and raised with care. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after several children came home from school to question their 
parents' lumber industry jobs, a campaign began to buzz-saw the book from the 
required reading list -- instead making it alternative reading. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a specially appointed review committee voted 6 to 1 last week to 
keep the book on the second-grade core list, "The Lorax" isn't out of the woods 
just yet. Logging advocates say they will appeal the issue to the school board, 
which meets next month. 
</P>
<P>
"To teach this book is insensitive to us as pillars of the community," said 
63-year-old Bud Harwood, whose family owned logging company in nearby Branscomb 
employs about 300 people, making it by far the area's biggest employer. "In our 
eyes, it's an attack on the integrity of our industry. It's not justified to 
have kids come home and tell their parents they're working in a bad industry, 
that they're criminals because they take the homes away from little animals." 
</P>
<P>
Without the controversy, teachers say, the book might well have been removed 
from the list soon enough. But now the issue borders on censorship, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute reflects tension that has been building in the community for months 
-- even years -- residents say. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the most recent haggling is the resentment felt by many logging 
families, which have lived quietly here for generations, against the often 
college-educated outsiders from San Francisco and Southern California who have 
invaded the region in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the kids have been dragged into it," said one coffee shop waitress who 
teaches dance part-time. "One little girl came up to me recently and said 
'Teacher, are you for the loggers or the hippies?' 
</P>
<P>
"They've taught their children that anyone with an environmentalist stand is a 
hippie. They even sponsored a campaign recently to tie a yellow ribbon on your 
car to show your support of the logging industry." 
</P>
<P>
A three-hour drive north of San Francisco, Laytonville is more than a million 
miles away from the big city in character and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
It's a place where country music blares over the radio waves, where the locals 
post signs in the middle of town congratulating couples on their latest child, 
no last names needed. 
</P>
<P>
The town sits on the southern face of the Redwood Wall -- named for the tree 
that for decades has provided the area not only with an economic base, but an 
emotional cushion from the noise and pollution of the rest of California. 
</P>
<P>
In Laytonville, the redwood is king. Symbols of the tree are everywhere. Locals 
call the surrounding region, "The Redwood Empire" and the stretch of U.S. 101 
where they live "The Redwood Highway." 
</P>
<P>
On the west side of Laytonville sits Harwood Park -- built with money donated 
by the logging family -- with its dance hall, baseball diamond and rodeo arena. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Bill and Judith Bailey, wealthy logging equipment wholesalers, 
donate half-a-dozen $1,000 scholarships to area children. The Baileys are the 
family who first pressed the school board on the use of "The Lorax." 
</P>
<P>
"They think that just because they bought the town, they can tell people how to 
think," said Kathi Cloninger, a member of the environmentalist group Earth 
First! A petition that was circulated to keep the book on the reading list drew 
at least 100 names, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Laytonville is unincorporated -- with no mayor, City Council or police 
force -- political hagglings are often played out on its school board and 
within the pages of its weekly newspaper, The Mendocino County Observer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drives New Jaguar 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who drives a shiny new Jaguar in a town dominated by pickup trucks and 
junkyard clunkers, has written letters to the editor, blasting newcomers for 
criticizing the town "even while their radiators are still overheating." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Ackermann, the newspaper's columnist retorted that, "The whole thing is a 
stab of desperation by the loggers, because they're in a dying business, simple 
as that." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the town's logging interests have taken on the school board, 
criticizing it for hiring too many inexperienced first-year teachers who come 
and go within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Art Harwood, the 36-year-old general manager of his family lumber business, 
used that theme to get elected to the five-member school board this year, 
becoming the second member with logging interests to sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
And then came "The Lorax" issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Baileys became upset after they discovered the journal kept by their 
8-year-old son, Sammy, about his reactions to the Seuss book, Bill Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came home one day and asked my wife, 'Papa doesn't love trees anymore, does 
he?' " said Bailey, who spent 14 years as a logger before opening his wholesale 
equipment business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petition Filed 
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports from friends of their own children's similar line of 
questioning, Judith Bailey filed a petition with the school district to have 
the book removed as required reading. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever suggested that the book be banned," said Bailey, a college English 
major who says he has read and enjoyed the book. "But now they're calling my 
wife a book banner and a book burner. It's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Theodor (Ted) Geisel, who as Dr. Seuss has written more than 40 children's 
books including "The Cat in the Hat" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," is 
baffled by his book's role in Laytonville's environmental controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"This book isn't against logging at all," the 85-year-old author said. "In 
fact, the book wasn't even concerned with the wood in the trees, it was the 
leaves at the top of the trees, that's all the Once-ler harvested. 
</P>
<P>
"Wood was used as a symbol for many things. I don't want to throw logs on their 
fire, but the book is taken up by schools and libraries all across the country 
as a symbol of conservation." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Buckley, superintendent of the Laytonville Unified School District, said 
the book was chosen to help satisfy the history, social science and literature 
requirements for second graders. 
</P>
<P>
Several students said they won't stop reading Dr. Seuss books. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Seuss is strange, that's why you like him," said 15-year-old Jonah 
Renfort. "People grow up on him. For a little town like this, Dr. Seuss is 
about the strangest you can get."

   Ah, December. Time to turn on the television and
get set for those wonderful, warm-hearted holiday specials.
   But what's this? Pee-Wee Herman and Grace Jones? The Brady Bunch
with gray hair? John Denver schmoozing in upscale Aspen?
   It's not that bad, really. Selective viewers can pick through the
junk like so much wrapping paper to find some gems this month.
   For instance, Jason Robards and Julie Harris star in ``HBO
Showcase: The Christmas Wife,'' a different kind of Christmas story
about two lonely strangers. And for those who like holidays with
wry, there's ``Season's Greetings,'' a comedy on the Arts &amp;
Entertainment Network written by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn.
On PBS, the King's Singers from England appear in concert with the
Kansas City Symphony in what promises to be a very special special.
   Here is a list of December holiday fare:
   Various times throughout the month: ``The Nutcracker,'' PBS. The
Tchaikovsky ballet performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and the American
Ballet Theatre premiered in 1976 and has become a TV classic.
   Dec. 10: ``The Care Bears' Nutcracker Suite,'' The Disney
Channel. The Care Bears go to Toyland to rescue the Sugarplum Fairy.

York restaurateur Ruth Adams Bronz of Miss Ruby's Cafe for down-home
cooking and conversation.
   Dec. 17: ``Bob Hope's Jolly Christmas Show With the All-America
Champs,'' NBC. Hope's annual holiday special, this time from Florida
and featuring the usual oddball array of guests: Dolly Parton, Don
Johnson, Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner, Dodgers
pitcher Orel Hershiser and The Associated Press All-America Football
team.
   Let it wash over you, or try going out.
   Dec. 18: ``A Very Brady Christmas,'' CBS. Reunites the family
that has achieved cult status in syndicated reruns. Snap out of it!
Go caroling, knit a sweater, take food to the homeless.
   Dec. 19: ``The Little Match Girl,'' NBC. A repeat of last year's
surprisingly good movie starring Keshia Knight Pulliam (``The Cosby
Show'') in the title role.
   Dec. 19: ``Christmas in Aspen,'' CBS. John Denver is host. Watch
it from the BMW, dahling.
   Dec. 20: ``Frosty the Snowman,'' CBS. The 1969 animated
perennial, narrated by Jimmy Durante. Followed by ``How the Grinch
Stole Christmas,'' first broadcast in 1966, a Dr. Seuss classic
narrated by Boris Karloff.

Schwarzenegger, Danny De Vito, Barbara Mandrell, Mike Tyson and
members of the Kennedy family celebrate Christmas with retarded
children who participate in Special Olympics.

all-star production. George C. Scott as Ebeneezer Scrooge. Edward
Woodward, David Warner and Susannah York co-star.

   MORE SETS, SETS ON MORE; OR, END OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION,
CONTINUED _ Americans average seven hours of television viewing a
day, or at least that's how long the average set is on, according to
a recent report by the A.C. Nielsen Co. Ten years ago, the set was
on an average of 6 hours and 13 minutes a day. In 1951, when only 9
percent of U.S. homes had televisions, the sets were on an average
of 4 hours and 43 minutes a day. Today, Nielsen estimates 904,000
U.S. households have televisions.

<LEADPARA>  'A CHRISTMAS Carol" is the holiday tradition I look forward to most, and
American Conservatory Theater does it better than anyone else.;   The original
1843 novella is more than a Christmas ornament, which is why it continues to
move people to tears, year after year. Charles Dickens wrote it as Christian
social protest: a lesson to England's comfortable middle classes, insulated
behind diamond-paned windows from the grime and despair of the Industrial
Revolution.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ACT'S 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' IS STILL THE BEST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Today, after the money-grubbing '80s, as we face recession and unemployment
and pay taxes to support our own post-Victorian workhouses, its powerful
message of responsibility and compassion still rings strong and true.;   ACT's
annual production of this parable is by now a classic, but the company isn't
resting on its laurels (or should we say its green bay and holly?) in its
silver anniversary season. It assigned the show to David Maier, co-founder of
its alumni Encore Theater Company, and he has freshened it wonderfully.;  
Maier has encouraged the actors to revisit the familiar text and add a wealth
of detail, as, for instance, the way Marley's ghost strains against his
fetters -- they're anchored somewhere in the netherworld -- to gain time so he
can warn Ebenezer Scrooge about the consequences of his miserly life. Or the
way a child in the Christmas Past episode puts his hand confidingly in
Scrooge's, causing that "covetous old sinner" to look down with surprise at
this human and loving gesture.;   William Paterson is Scrooge in 13 of the 25
performances, with Ken Ruta in the other 12. Both are past masters of the
role, able to snarl "Bah, humbug!" with panache.;   There are genial
performances from Michael Scott Ryan as the ironic narrator, Richard
Butterfield and Judith Moreland as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit, Kelvin Han Yee as
Marley's ghost, Mark Silence as nephew Fred. Laurie McDermott turns the sweet
integrity of Belle, young Scrooge's lost love, into purest silver, which also
describes the voice of the caroler, Danielle Vinje.;   The production does
tend to run long, by about 10 minutes. That's fixable.;   The whole takes
place on Robert Blackman's enchanting unit set, an Advent calendar with
candelabra, toys, street lamps, door knockers, clock faces and inkwells carved
into its veneer. If you look closely, you can see that it has cash boxes for
steps and piled-up account ledgers for bedposts.;   I was struck, this time
through, to recognize the beautiful recurring song by Lee Hoiby as a true
carol: that is, a strophic song. The story itself is strophic -- Dickens
called its divisions "staves," not chapters -- and each section represents one
stanza in the carol of Ebenezer Scrooge, the grinch stolen by Christmas.;   --

Germany's Grinch</HL>

<TEXT>
   A dispute is wending its way through the German courts on the question of stollen. 
This is a German Christmas cake. 
The lumpy loaf full of raisins, butter and almonds -- and covered with white powdery sugar -- holds an incontestable place on tables in Germany during the Christmas season. 
Now East German bakeries are going to West Germany's top court to argue that capitalist competitors have stolen their stollen. 

   Stollen's traditional source is the Saxon town of Dresden, whose ovens for six centuries have produced the loaves. 
Stollen grew scarce during the war, when Germany lacked the butter to produce it. 
The cake's revival has been brought about not only by the new state bakers in Dresden but also by West German bakers, who make what they call "Dresden stollen." 
Germans have given the item a world-wide popularity -- the West German baker B. Wendeln sells 150,000 of the calorie bombs each yule. 

   An East German baking cooperative, Backwaren Kombinat Dresden, is charging that West German firms mislead when they call their product "Dresden stollen." 
They've moved to stop the old Munich bakery Rischart from producing the cakes. 
They've also challenged five other Western stollen makers, though cookery lore shows Dresden stollen has been made outside Dresden since 1650. 
A 1936 standard work describes stollen as "baked goods from German regions." 
Some East German dictionary publishers recognize that the word "Dresden" is more a part of the cake's name than an indication of its origins. 

   The East Germans could be raising queries they don't want to carry to the logical conclusion. 
If stollen really is a trademark, who is the rightful owner? 
Maybe it's the original inventor's heirs. 
In short, if anyone has stolen stollen it may well be the Marxists. 
And if that's the case, someone ought to see whether they're the ones who also stole East Germany's Christmas.

A MOSTLY CHEERLESS, CHILLY 'CHILD'S CHRISTMAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales" is not a Yule postcard, dripping 
with sentiment. It's a poet's vivid evocation of a jubilant boyhood Christmas 
Day spent with his large family in Swansea, South Wales. But you would reap 
many more rewards if you read the story this season rather than endure Troupe 
America's touring production. 
</P>
<P>
This bus-and-truck company from Minneapolis is faithful to the story but not to 
its spirit. Christmas here leaves you logy, as in too much turkey. The 15 
actors and the handful of props -- a hearth, a huge Christmas tree, a piano, a 
bar -- get lost on a cavernous stage. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the story's lure is more apparent at other theaters. But Beckman 
Auditorium at Caltech, where the show was seen Saturday, is not a dramatic 
venue. It's an orchestral and concert stage. A feast like "A Child's Christmas 
in Wales" gets swallowed up there, nullifying its ebullience. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset the production seemed chilly, and it only recovered near the 
end when the actors playing Thomas' family, his chums and colorful relatives, 
captured for a warm moment your own cheeriest Christmas memories. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' literary achievement is a Puckish menu of language and imagery 
embracing a morning's frolic in the snow, the unwrapping of presents and the 
gathering of the clan and the family dinner. Everyone is indeed a character. 
</P>
<P>
The story's language is painterly, suggesting those vibrant Christmas scenes 
with the family racing through the vast decorated house in Ingmar Bergman's 
"Fanny and Alexander." 
</P>
<P>
But proceedings at Beckman had the sluggish pace of real life -- that meant 
lots of dead spaces and pauses that deflated the work's buoyancy. Also some of 
the accents and the diction were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Troupe America, for the most part, did catch the flavor of the '20s. The 
singing was fetching, and the actors playing the Dylan Thomas roles were 
convincing (Bernard Marks as the older Dylan looking back on his childhood and 
Larry Dean Birkett as young Dylan). But too many grinches stole Noel. Even the 
tree seemed bare of ornaments, and Dylan's dearly longed-for new red bike was, 
of all things, a contemporary model. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Saturday, 8 p.m., at Plummer Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. 
Tickets: $12.50 to $17.50 (714) 773-3371. Also Sunday, 7 p.m., at Marsee 
Auditorium, El Camino College, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance. Tickets: $15 to

   Add another familiar name to the list of management
mavens: Theodor S. Geisel.
   S as in Seuss. As in Dr. Seuss.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The children's author who put "Green Eggs and Ham" on
practically every kid's breakfast plate is being served up as
recommended fare to grown-up managers. Cynthia Eisenhauer,
for one, urges her staff at the Iowa Department of Employment
Services, where she is director, to savor the wisdom in the
86-year-old author's most recent book, "Oh, the Places You'll
Go]"
   Here is one such morsel:
   You have brains in your head.
   You have feet in your shoes.
   You can steer yourself
   any direction you choose.
   "It's inspirational and encourages people to set high
standards and work to achieve them without being
discouraged," exclaims Ms. Eisenhauer.
   Carolyn B. Elman, executive director of the American
Business Women's Association, agrees. She has been pushing
the book to her group's 100,000 members. Unlike many
how-to-succeed books, she contends, "this book lets you know
everyone fails at some time and that you have to pick
yourself up and just go on." Dr. Seuss's prescription:
   Out there things can happen
   and frequently do
   to people as brainy
   and footsy as you.
   And when things start to happen,
   don't worry. Don't stew.
   Just go right along.
   You'll start happening too.
   Nearly 800,000 copies of the book have been sold since it
was released early this year, reports Random House, which is
marketing it "as a book for anyone starting out on a new
adventure in life," says a spokeswoman. Described on its
jacket as a graduation speech for "out-starting upstarts of
all ages," the book has been on the New York Times fiction
best-seller list for more than 30 weeks.
   Like Grinches, some big-name management gurus are giving
their newest colleague the brushoff. "I haven't gotten to it
yet," says Peter Drucker, who suggests he prefers Shakespeare
to Seuss as a management tool.
   What does Dr. Seuss say about all this? "While I had no
intention of speaking directly to managers when I wrote the
book, I'm pleased when readers get something beyond what I
intended."

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush Tops Off National Christmas Tree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush ascended 35 feet aboard a bumpy
hydraulic boom on Thursday and placed the crowning ornament atop the
National Christmas Tree, a Colorado blue spruce just beyond the back
fence of the house she'll move into next month.
   It was the eighth consecutive year the wife of the vice president
has performed that task, and one she apparently doesn't want to give
up when husband George's title is shortened. ``It's the only thing
I've done more than anyone else,'' she told a guest in a reception
line afterwards. ``I love it.''
   To a separate guest she said ``I would be offended if someone
else did it.''
   President Reagan is to light the live national tree for his last
time Dec. 15, after which a pageant featuring 57 trees, each
decorated with ornaments from a different state or territory, will
be opened. More than 700,000 people visited the exhibit last year.
   The tree was transplanted to its spot on the Ellipse, a park
betwen the White House and the Washington Monument, in 1978 after
two earlier trees died before taking root.
   Two classes of Washington first-graders applauded and cheered as
Mrs. Bush had an animated chat with puppet dinosaurs Rex and Rita
Readasaurus and Pageant Director Joe Riley as they rode the boom
basket skyward.
   ``It was a shakey ride,'' said Lynn Hippen who was crouched down
in the boom box with puppet designer Brad Williams, ``but everyone
maintained their balance and poise.''
   The puppets, Williams said, were ``hatched'' at the National Zoo
in May to promote the national Reading is Fundamental program. He
said they and Mrs. Bush talked about the ride and the children
below, who included two of Mrs. Bush's grandchildren, twins Barbara
and Jenna Bush.
   ``Has anyone read `The Grinch Who Stole Christmas?''' Mrs. Bush
asked the youngsters after coming down from the tree.
   ``I saw it on TV,'' one child said.
   ``It's better if you read it,'' Mrs. Bush said.

AID FLOWS IN TO REPLACE FAMILY'S STOLEN CHRISTMAS 
</P>

An unexpected blizzard of Christmas cheer fell Tuesday upon an impoverished 
South-Central Los Angeles family whose home was cleaned out by thieves while 
the mother visited her young, cancer-stricken daughter at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The two police officers who were flagged down by a distraught Blanche Griffin 
after she found her West 85th Street home looted of clothing, food and wrapped 
Christmas gifts reached into their own pockets and immediately purchased $100 
worth of replacement toys for her five children. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Henry Winkler dispatched a $1,000 check and a personal letter to the 
family to express his dismay at the Scrooge-like attack, which left Griffin, 
34, with an empty closet and her children with only the clothes on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's landlord quickly found a new house for her to move into. And workers 
from AT&amp;T volunteered to install a free security alarm system in it to 
protect the family in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan telephoned Griffin to offer his best wishes for 
her 9-year-old daughter's recovery and to promise his assistance in replacing 
household goods that were spirited off early Monday while Griffin and three of 
her children visited ailing Vernika Griffin at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday night, new clothing, toys, canned food and more than $3,500 in cash 
had been dropped off for the family at the Los Angeles Police Department's 77th 
Street Division station. 
</P>
<P>
"People have just opened their hearts," said Sgt. Art Ficke, whose office was 
serving as a clearinghouse for the donations. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was in tears as some of the toys were delivered to Vernika at the 
hospital by firefighters and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a miracle," said Griffin, a single mother who moved with four of her 
children from Arkansas to Los Angeles two years ago to work as a domestic. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my family would not be able to enjoy this Christmas. I thought it 
would be a disaster because we had spent all of the money we had on clothes and 
toys and it was all gone." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Griffin had been surprised by Reagan's telephone call when she visited 
the police station to thank Officers Juan Santos and Kevin Becker for the toys 
they had purchased. 
</P>
<P>
The former President said he had been moved by news reports of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the desperation on her face when she ran out and flagged us 
down," Santos said of Griffin. "People had been watching her house, and they 
knew she went to the hospital every day to visit her little sick girl." 
</P>
<P>
Her plight was familiar to Santos, 39. The eight-year veteran said he grew up 
the son of a New York minister whose home was frequently burglarized Sunday 
mornings by thugs who knew the family would be at church. 
</P>
<P>
Santos and Becker discovered that about $1,200 worth of gifts had been 
purloined from Griffin's house -- including a battery-powered toy police 
motorcycle, a blackboard and a stereo set. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts were for Vernika and Griffin's son Donta, 12, and other daughters, 
Tasha, 8, and Alicisa, 2. Another son, Steven, 16, lives with Griffin's mother 
in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
As gifts and cash poured in Tuesday, Becker promised Griffin that police will 
use the money to purchase replacement clothing and household goods so she is 
not disqualified from Medi-Cal payments that are covering Vernika's 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, Vernika clutched a check for $250 donated by hospital workers, 
and hugged her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Momma, why are you crying?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carole Hurvitz, director of the children's cancer treatment program at the 
hospital, said Vernika -- and her family -- have won the hearts of doctors and 
nurses because of their daily visits over the 20 weeks that the girl has been a 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Vernika's condition is guarded, Hurvitz said. Cancer that started in the girl's 
brain last year has spread to her spine. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get her home in time for Christmas, but she'll have to come back 
again next week for more chemotherapy," Hurvitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Griffin: "It's going to be our best Christmas ever."

   Even Scrooge, on his worst bah-humbug
days, might have shed a tear at the sight.
   What appears at first glance to be a jolly Santa's workshop in
this Washington suburb is actually a torture chamber for Christmas
toys that is worthy of the Spanish Inquisition.
   Working behind closed doors in a small room stacked high with
Yuletide goodies, Bob Hundemer, the Torquemada of the toy business,
is gleefully wrenching the nose off a cuddly teddy bear.
   Nearby, a bespectacled helper is calmly dismembering a stack of
dolls with blonde tresses, yanking off their arms without a trace
of emotion. At his elbow are the shattered remains of dump trucks,
airplanes and baby rattles, and bits of stuffing from disemboweled
toy animals.
   They are working in the toy testing laboratory of the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission, and their tables are crowded
with diabolical devices specifically designed to fold, spindle and
mutilate _ or worse.
   Clamps and torque wrenches are applied to the eyes of lovable
toy monkeys. Teething rings are dropped in pots of boiling water.
Stuffed bears are battered with finger-like probes.
   Is this guy the Grinch who stole Christmas, or what?
   ``No, I feel more like the good witch of the North,'' says
Hundemer, chief of the two-man laboratory which is housed in the
drab former barracks of an abandoned Nike missile site about 15
miles northwest of Washington.
   With extra help to cope with the Christmas rush, Hundemer and
his assistant, Garfield Jenkins, work full time testing about 900
toys annually for potential safety hazards to children.
   Hundemer estimates that more than two-thirds _ many of them
mass-produced imports from Mexico or the Far East _ flunk the
commission's stringent standards. They are either recalled for
redesigning or banned from the market as unfit for putting under
the Christmas tree.
   Last year, 245 toys were voluntarily recalled by manufacturers
at the agency's urging. Some of the worst offenders will be
displayed at a Dec. 1 news conference, when the commission will
give its annual Christmas warning to toy-buying parents.
   By far, the biggest threat posed by hazardous toys, which
accounted for 142,000 injuries and a minimum of 22 deaths last
year, are small parts that children can easily detach with their
teeth or fingers and put in their mouths, causing choking or
asphyxiation.
   Most choking deaths involve balloons, marbles and other small
balls, says John E. Preston, a mechanical engineer who designed
many of the agency's toy-testing procedures. But balloons and
marbles are exempt from government safety regulations because of
their universal popularity as children's playthings.
   ``Can we tolerate the 10 deaths of children every year from
choking on balloons?'' Preston asked. ``On the other hand, we don't
believe the world is ready to accept a ban on balloons and marbles.
We're perplexed about what we can do.''
   Hundemer says he has ``compelling reasons'' for his personal
interest in toy safety as the parent of two small children.
   The government can't begin to test all the 150,000 different
toys on the market, he said, ``so don't depend on the government to
provide you with complete safety.'' Parents must play an active
role in monitoring toy safety.
   Look for durability and quality of construction, he says, and
select toys suitable for a child's age and skills. Avoid buying
toys with small parts or long cords for infants or toddlers.
   Be particularly cautious about small balls and toys that shoot
projectiles or contain electrical heating elements. Consult label
precautions and follow instructions. Supervise children at play,
and repair or discard damaged toys immediately.
   ``Don't be fooled when a clerk says `we couldn't sell it if it
weren't safe,''' Hundemer said. ``That's not true, and people who
believe that are misguided.''

The Grinch tried to steal Christmas from the Daybreak Tree Farm and Nursery 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the nursery, a nonprofit business that employs and trains the 
handicapped, had worked all year potting plants and tending trees to prepare 
for Christmas, their busiest season. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Monday night, burglars sliced through a chain-link fence, chopped down 
Christmas trees and stole $4,000 worth of wreaths, ornaments and potted plants 
from the farm at 1550 N. Glassell St. 
</P>
<P>
The profits from the plants were to benefit the nursery's handicapped 
employment program. Hoping to save part of the season, the nursery immediately 
ordered more plants from its supplier, Santiago Greenhouses in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
But Santiago Greenhouses ended up playing Santa Claus, replacing the nursery's 
losses for free. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe it. We were in tears," nursery director Mary Lou Bayle 
said. "They turned a very bad day into a very good day." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Greenhouses donated Daybreak's order, threw in an additional 150 
plants and later offered more poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Tursini, manager of Santiago Greenhouses, said owner Mark Stansbury made 
the donation without thinking twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not anything that extraordinary," Tursini said. "It's just helping people 
who are trying to help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Daybreak Tree Farm and Nursery has trees on 2 acres in north Orange. The 
farm, a division of the nonprofit Speech &amp; Language Development Center in 
Buena Park, offers job training to the mentally, physically and emotionally 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Daybreak program is to help participants learn to be 
financially independent, said Dede Ginter, spokeswoman for the Speech &amp; 
Language Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
This week, they learned a tougher lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"They learned a lesson about the real world and that there are rotten people 
who cut down Christmas trees," Ginter said. 
</P>
<P>
But the lesson had another moral, said Tursini. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the times and it's sad," he said. "There's really not much you 
can do -- but you can try to help a little bit."MARY HELEN BERG

   A grinch stole Easter in this
western Colorado city by swiping 300 eggs that had been hidden in
three city parks for egg hunts sponsored by two local businesses.
   ``There were all these little kids and their mothers walking
around with empty Easter baskets,'' said Marilynn Sinclair, who
took her young nephew to Hawthorne Park Friday morning. ``It was
sad.''
   The sponsors planned to try again with egg hunts at the same
three parks today and Sunday morning.
   They set a maximum age limit of 13 and decided to be on the
lookout for early egg thieves.

   The Security Council president, France's ambassador to the
U.N., said he had received a letter from Iraq's envoy
offering to free the team. Baghdad urged the chief of the
experts to fly to the Iraqi capital and demanded that the
inspectors sign for each document they remove concerning
Iraq's nuclear program. The inspectors, who had been detained
a second day in a parking lot in Baghdad, earlier refused to
surrender the items. The papers reportedly include data on

   A decision to enforce an 11-year-old health
ordinance on a charitable group's functions has members scrambling
to provide a Christmas meal for thousands of hungry Houston
residents.
   Last week, the Health Department started requiring the Citywide
Club of Clubs to follow an ordinance that requires food served to
the public to be prepared at a city-approved kitchen, just in time
to cause problems for the group's annual Thanksgiving feast for the
needy.
   The private, non-profit community service organization has
relied heavily in the past on donations of home-prepared food _
turkey, hams, dressing, vegetables, desserts, relishes _ to pull
off its annual Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, club Director
Leroy Woodward said Tuesday.
   Last week, because of the new enforcement, volunteers faced with
a record 60,000 people for Thanksgiving ran out of food three or
four times, and only the hasty barbecuing of 500 chickens saved the
day, he said.
   ``Now you can't get through our main telephone lines because of
all the needy people calling up to make reservations for our annual
Christmas feast on Dec. 23,'' said Woodward. ``And we're scared.
We're afraid we're not going to be able to feed all these folks.''
   Joe Zuchlewski, a health department official, was unable to
explain why the group wasn't required to meet the ordinance until
this year.
   ``We appreciate all the work that the Citywide Club is doing in
feeding all these people but, by the same token, we want to make
sure the food is safe,'' said Zuchlewski. ``We're just trying to
protect the public.''
   Health department officials will gladly work with club members
to make sure they know how to conduct their feast according to
regulations, Zuchlewski said.
   ``There are all kinds of items that can be donated that will
satisfy people on the street and satisfy the health code,''
Zuchlewski said. The department cited such things as canned
vegetables or frozen turkeys.
   Woodward is worried, but he hesitates to slam the health
department.
   ``They gave us their reason and we understand. If people even
put harmful things in trick or treat candy, we understand the
potential problem of letting people bring prepared food,'' he said.
   ``But even though we understand, we're still left with the
problem of feeding all those hungry people.''
   In addition to feeding the hungry and needy, the club last year
distributed 12,000 donated toys to children and registered more
than 7,000 people for jobs and housing.

<LEADPARA>  IT IS the day before Christmas, 1991, and most of us are again involved in our
annual delusion that giving gifts and whooping it up make us better people.
This is a time for reflection for a society that finds it necessary to pass
out condoms to high school students, to mass-produce handguns and refuse to
increase control of them, and to wallow in ugly accusations against a nominee
to the Supreme Court of the United States.;   We remain a society rich with
contradiction and poor in resolve. If one man is murdered, the perpetrator is
a villain. Murder a dozen, the military decorates you as a hero. Murder a
million and you go down in the annals of history as a world leader.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I suppose that we should all be thinking happy thoughts because it's
Christmastime. But what are we supposed to do with truth? Are we to deny
reality for a week? During the rest of the year they put people in mental
hospitals for doing that.;   Even a filmed message from President Bush or the
mayor does not fill me with joy at what I see. No, I am not suggesting that we
all walk around with our heads hanging in despair. What I do suggest is that
we hold our heads up high and return to the real meaning of Christmas.;  
While we are collecting new clothes, flashy toys and fine cars, we should
pause to recall that this should be the season for renewed dedication to the
principles of love and respect for all of us.;   This is the time to resolve
to end child abuse, wife-battering, worldwide hunger and corruption. This is
the moment to commit to the handicapped, to recall the great teachings of
Mohandas Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
The way to renewal is to begin with our individual selves.;   Christmas has
become no more than an opportunity to broaden our materialism. Many families
strain their budgets each December because they are too embarrassed or too
insecure to face their loved ones with empty hands even though their hearts
are full.;   Long ago my family abandoned gift-giving at Christmas. What
provided us with greater pleasure was the meaning of the gift of life and the
inherent value of every man, woman and child on this planet.;   For several
years we rebelled at the encroaching commercialism of Christmas. Though my
children, now adults, did not join the celebration through gift-giving, they
are slipping back into that flawed routine. Now that they are on their own I
suppose the magnetism of holiday merchants is too irresistible, the lure of
pipe organs too great for them to withstand. But Christmas means far more to
me than a new football, a fancy camera or an outrageous tie.;   All year long,
we offend one another's deepest sensibilities. We engage in unkind deeds,
dishonest acts, and then at Christmas we rush out and spend billions on toys,
household furnishings, fancy automobiles and other gifts, while not far from
our homes, our neighbors exist yearlong on starvation diets.;   In our
kindness we seldom forget the poor entirely. Generally, we remember by sending
a $5 toy to some child languishing in loneliness in some institution. Too
often such a child spends time hoping he or she will be adopted and finally
have a family, a hug and a home.;   Each year, with predictable regularly, we
learn of those delivering food baskets to the poor and hungry. This is a kind
act, but who helped those same needy families on March 1, or June 20, or Aug.
6, when hunger was just as real and Christmas was many months off?;   All year
long we step over men and women and children lying on sidewalks and steam
vents as we hurry off to nowhere. Many of us have grown so used to these
prostrate forms, we no longer even see them.;   I can no longer rejoice over a
wrapped gift at Christmas while blacks and whites, Asians, Hispanics, Indians
and others -- all Americans -- are at each others' throats. It is also
difficult for me to put aside the problems of world hunger, the violence
between nations, the deadly trap of drug and alcohol addiction, the ineptness
of the White House and Congress and of local government and the transgressions
we have grown used to.;   I am not religious but I am very respectful. And it
is because of this respect that I no longer dwell on materialism. It pains me
that every year most of us go off on a commercial binge on the birth date of a
man named Jesus Christ who was born in a stable, offered Is life to those who
would accept it and died in a plain garment on a rough wooden cross.;   I
refuse to trade what he represents for Santa Claus, Rudolph the reindeer, or
"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas."  </TEXT>

LAW: A 'DEPUTY' CUT INTO BOB VINCENT'S CHRISTMAS TREE SALES IN DANA POINT. AN 
ORDINANCE DOES PREVENT TREE SALES UNTIL DEC. 4, BUT OFFICIALS WON'T PUT VINCENT

<P>
Start with an old law everyone ignores, add a mystery man masquerading as a 
deputy, throw in a few Douglas firs and what you have is a plot befitting a 
detective novel. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way Bob Vincent sees it. And all over a few Christmas 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
It all started last week when Vincent, an entrepreneur from Portland, Ore., 
staked out ground at the corner of Del Prado Avenue and Street of the Golden 
Lantern to sell his bright-green Douglas firs. 
</P>
<P>
A bit early, maybe, but Vincent has been selling trees at the Dana Point 
location for the past four years, and business has been good. And no one, let 
alone the police, has ever protested. 
</P>
<P>
But last Saturday all that changed when a man, dressed in the uniform of an 
Orange County Sheriff's deputy, paid him a visit and ordered him to shut his 
business. The deputy cited an rdinance prohibiting the sale of trees before 
Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to set up and sell Christmas trees on the Fourth of July, 
if you were stupid enough to do that," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem, according to police, was that the uniformed man was no deputy 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't anyone from our department," said Lt. Dan Martini, speaking on 
behalf of the department, which provides police coverage for Dana Point. "This 
isn't a case of the deputy who stole Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
If he wasn't a deputy, then who was he? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent isn't sure, but he speculates that some of his competitors may be out 
to get him. Vincent said that a competitor, angry over the Del Prado Avenue 
lot's early start, confronted him earlier this week and threatened to have his 
permit revoked for the entire holiday season if he didn't close. The competitor 
would not identify himself, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, city officials said no complaint had been filed against 
Vincent, but conceded that there were grounds for legal action. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when the city was incorporated last year, Dana Point adopted a 
set of county laws, including an obscure one that prohibits the sale of 
Christmas trees before Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Vincent's case was the first time they had heard of the 
ordinance and added that it was unlikely it would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to rush back from my home this weekend to place a stop-work 
order on these guys," said Ed Knight, city director of community development. 
"We'll probably revoke this section by next year so we don't run into the 
problem again." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, meanwhile, said he plans to reopen his tree lot today, -- with or 
without the law on his side.

   Stung by cries of ``grinch,'' planning
commissioners are trying to write some yuletide spirit into an
ordinance that inadvertently made lawbreakers out of most of the
city's Christmas tree dealers.
   The city's building inspections department presented eviction
notices earlier this month to 14 of the 17 outdoor Christmas tree
dealers in this Grand Rapids' suburb, including the Wyoming Park
High School Band Boosters.
   The evictions resulted from an ordinance enacted last summer to
ban outdoor sales.
   ``When we passed that ordinance, frankly, no one thought about
Christmas trees,'' Gerald Mears, head of Wyoming's planning and
inspections departments, told planning commissioners Tuesday.
   The dealers were told to clear the trees off their lots or pay a
$110 application for a zoning variance, prompting Councilman Edward
Frederick to call Mears a ``Grinch.''
   At their latest meeting, the council ordered that all Christmas
tree dealers should be left alone this year and that new language
allowing their continued operation be written into the law.
   ``It was not our intention to stop Christmas,'' said Councilman
Michel Hill.

   How do you wrap a Christmas pickle? And
what about the pressing problem of wrapping an ironing board in a
pretty holiday package?
   Those were just some of the dilemmas that faced the volunteers
this year at a gift-wrapping booth in the North Platte Mall.
   ``We've done a dill pickle, an ironing board, a boat ladder and
an ornamental yard windmill,'' said Eva Weber, a volunteer at the
booth run by the North Platte Church of God.
   By the time the booth closes on Christmas Eve, the 15 volunteers
from the tiny congregation of 35 will have wrapped an estimated
2,000 packages.
   ``We use about 6,000 bows over Christmas,'' said Sheri Clark,
whose husband, Bob, is the minister of the church.
   Proceeds from the booth provide the church with money for
community and mission work.
   The volunteers said an important part of their job is to
``scrounge the Dumpsters'' for odd-sized boxes.
   ``We want the finished product to look professional. We take a
lot of pride in how we do the job,'' Mrs. Weber said.
   Even that special Christmas pickle.

   Roy Collette will need a jackhammer and a
torch this year to open the annual Christmas gag gift of a
2-decade-old pair of moleskin pants from his brother-in-law Larry
Kunkel.
   The gift was delivered to his home Saturday in this southeastern
Minnesota city via flatbed semi-truck in a concrete-filled container
resembling a space capsule.
   As the truck moved slowly up the street, Collette acknowledged he
was in for a heavy job of unwrapping.
   ``There are three axles underneath the trailer. That tells you
something,'' he said, calling the whole business ``foolishness.''
   Kunkel and his crew of six volunteers spent 45 minutes unloading
the gift by crane and setting it upright in the driveway.
   Collette merely repeated: ``He's gonna pay for this one.''
   The ``package'' weighs several tons, stands more than 12 feet
high, measures 8 feet in diameter and comes with a U.S. flag.
Printed on the capsule, which is actually the barrel of a concrete
mixer, are the words ``United States Command Module Roy ``88.''
   The moleskin pants, circa 1964, are in a gas can somewhere inside.
   They've plagued the brothers-in-law for more than 20 years. They
originated as a gift to Kunkel from his mother. He discovered the
cotton, fake suede pants stiffened in cold weather and gave them to
Collette, who found them just as unappealing.
   Collette wrapped them up and returned them to Kunkel one
Christmas and the exchange continued each year until Collette
packaged them in a bucket of cement. But Kunkel managed to extract
them.
   The packaging has become increasingly elaborate as the men try to
out-wrap each other.
   Last year, the brothers-in-law agreed to end the prank. They were
going to tie the pants to the trunks of their vehicles, split them
in half and burn them. But Collette added a twist. With a slip of
the rope, the pants went sailing off, fully intact, behind Kunkel's
vehicle.

   Volunteers in two cities hustled on Christmas day to cook up and
serve replacement donations after thieves stole thousands of
dollars worth of food for the needy, and it was the 50th Christmas
for Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
   ``As far as Christmas goes, this is it, folks,'' Col. John
Richardson told The Charlotte Observer on Sunday from Panama, where
he was leading a task force of troops from Camp Lejeune near
Jacksonville, N.C. ``No sign of Bob Hope.''
   Several dozen pro-choice and AIDS activists demonstrated outside
St. Vibiana's Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles to protest the
Roman Catholic Church's stance against abortion and the use of
condoms. As Archbishop Roger Mahony said a Christmas mass Monday
morning, demonstrators carried signs that said ``Jesus Saves Souls.
Condoms Save Lives.''
   A Chicago center was back in business handing out food Christmas
Day after thieves stole thousands of dollars worth of turkeys,
hams, toys and clothing collected for a traditional Christmas Eve
giveaway to 1,500 needy people.
   ``We've had calls and people coming in from all over the city,''
Frank Campbell, spokesman for the Paul Hall Community Services
Center, said Monday. ``It's really been something to see. ... We'll
be here giving out food until everything runs out.''
   The hungry and homeless sat down at Atlanta's annual Christmas
feast and were served pizza _ because turkeys and a lot of
trimmings were stolen shortly before the meal was to begin.
   ``Luckily, people have answered our radio plea and are bringing
food to us,'' said Elizabeth Williams-Omilami, daughter of the
event's organizer, civil rights leader Hosea Williams. They had
estimated earlier that they could feed up to 40,000 and still
insisted they could feed everyone who showed up.
   U.S. soldiers injured in Panama and recovering at Wilford Hall
Medical Center in San Antonio exchanged presents with relatives in
specially set up rooms, said Staff Sgt. Rey Adame, a hospital
spokesman.
   Area residents volunteered to help sort gifts, cards and letters
sent to the GIs injured in Panama.
   ``You look around, you'll see the Yuletide season all over the
place here,'' Adame said.
   The children of the advertising copywriter who created Rudolph
50 years ago for a Montgomery Ward's promotion booklet said they
are grateful year-round for the residual payments they still get
from the storybook reindeer who guided Santa's sleigh with his
shiny nose.
   The writer's daughter, Elizabeth Decker of Lake Bluff, Ill.,
says that every Christmas season her father, Robert May, used to
look out the window at a statue of the reindeer and say ``Thank
you, Rudolph.''
   In Watsonville, Calif., 1,400 families stood in a line around
the block Christmas Eve waiting for the city's annual toy giveaway.
It took on new meaning this year after an estimated 1,200 homes and
businesses were destroyed in the agricultural town near the
epicenter of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   George Romano, who has been collecting for victims since shortly
after the quake, delivered 5,000 toys to children living in a
makeshift trailer park.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Monrovia, police Officer Ruben
Gonzalez said he was touched by the sight of a little girl crying
when her home went up in flames Saturday night.
   Fellow officers came up with $500, an amount matched by the
Monrovia Police Association. The six children of two families that
were ousted by the fire were given gifts to unwrap Christmas
morning in their Red Cross-provided hotel.
   Donations also came from a bike shop, a grocery store, and a
coffee shop Gonzalez stopped at during a break on his graveyard
shift. A tree lot donated a tree that was decorated with ornaments
taken from the police station tree.
   ``I didn't realize people would be so giving,'' Gonzalez said
Christmas Eve.
   Elsewhere in southern California, Christmas was a day for
bare-chested natives to smear on tanning oil and soak up some rays,
or try out Christmas gift surfboards and wetsuits.
   On the same day Miami had a record low of 30, the noon
temperature was 81 degrees in Oxnard, 78 in downtown Los Angeles
and 77 in Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, Oceanside, San Diego and
Palm Springs.
   ``I am really happy to be in L.A. We don't have a lot of
palms,'' said Christina Giourdas, a Lufthansa flight attendant from
West Berlin who visited a Venice beach cafe on Christmas Eve.
