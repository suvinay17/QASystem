For More Men, Old Gray Hair
Ain't What It Appears to Be

   SINCE 1961, Combe Inc. has been marketing Grecian Formula 16 as a way for men to subtly tint gray hair. 
The product works gradually over three to four weeks so that friends may not even suspect the hair has been colored. 
After all, what would people think if they knew a man dyed his hair? 

   But attitudes change. 
The 1980s man, it seems, can now act like a peacock and color his hair without feeling ashamed. 
This month, Combe is launching a second hair coloring product called Just for Men that boldly transforms gray hair to brown in just five minutes. 
The instant change is, of course, apparent to everyone. 
"There's not the big stigma anymore about coloring your hair," says Dominic DeMain, vice president of marketing for Combe's hair-care products. 
"Men feel younger and want to look it. 
They tell us they want an immediate color change if they have a job interview or a date with a new girlfriend." 

   Combe, in fact, believes times have never been better for selling men's hair dye. 
For one thing, the company finds that many middle-aged men today worry about competition on the job from aggressive young baby boomers. 
Gray hair, they feel, is a handicap, and they are increasingly willing to consider dyeing it. 
In addition, Combe expects Just for Men to benefit from the fact that many older men admire President Reagan, who has barely a speck of silver showing at age 76. 
"The market potential is simply huge," declares Mr. DeMain. 
"We figure only 3.5 million of the 33 million men with gray hair currently use a color treatment." 

   THE MARKET LOOKS even more promising five to 10 years from now. 
Combe is betting that male baby boomers, most of whom are in their 20s and 30s, will not grow old gracefully. 
Because these young men so value their health and physical appearance, Combe and other marketers expect them to get face lifts, exercise to stay trim, buy anti-baldness products -- and color the gray away. 

   But that's a debatable point. 
Some marketing consultants believe honesty will ultimately prevail over vanity. 
They predict that Americans will become less obsessed with a youthful appearance and will prefer a more natural look. 
"I don't believe men will hide the truth with hair coloring," says Carol Colman, a partner at Inferential Focus, a New York research firm. 
"What I see coming is more honesty about who you are." 

   Even now, many men remain reluctant to tint their hair. 
A recent survey of 1,000 middle-aged men revealed that 43% believe it's "OK" to color gray hair, but the majority disapprove, or at least have some reservations. 
Perhaps more than anything else, men fear that a home coloring kit will give their hair a greenish or purplish cast. 
Or something worse. 
"Many men have tried home products and ended up with orange hair," says Patrice Serrani, grooming editor for GQ magazine. 
"It's probably best for a man to let a professional at a salon teach him to use hair coloring." 

   SALES OF home hair coloring products specifically targeted to men total about $47 million a year. 
But that doesn't fully cover the amount of money men spend on home hair dyes. 

   Cosmair Inc. receives many inquiries from men wondering whether they can use the company's L'Oreal colors for women. 
"We tell them, 'Of course you can,'" says James Viera, a vice president at Cosmair. 
"We're all humans with the same kind of hair." 
Bristol-Myers Co. similarly finds that men use its Clairol Loving Care and Nice 'n Easy, often borrowing them from wives or girlfriends. 

   Combe hopes Just for Men, which features photos of virile young men on the package, will be a welcome alternative to those women's brands. 
"Men feel a little embarrassed going to the cash register with products that show only pictures of women on the boxes," says Mr. DeMain, the marketing executive at Combe. 

   Just for Men is being shipped to stores now, and in August, a TV commercial for the brand will begin running, featuring a typical "before and after" demonstration. 
The hair coloring is the culmination of 10 years of development and testing, an unusually slow process for a consumer product. 
Why so long? 
"We had to come up with colors that blended in naturally, and that is complicated chemistry," explains Herbert Lapidus, director of research and development. 
"The product also had to be quick and easy to shampoo in so it wouldn't interfere with men's normal grooming regimen. 
They won't sit for 40 minutes with goop on their hair the way women do." 

   WITH A NEW PRODUCT like Just for Men, there's always the danger that it will cannibalize sales of Combe's other coloring product, Grecian Formula. 
But the company isn't fretting because it believes Just for Men's faster action and more noticeable results will appeal to a different type of customer. 
In fact, Combe says, Grecian Formula's sales rose 14% in cities where Just for Men was test marketed. 

   Just for Men faces little competition from other marketers. 
The one large company in the market -- Bristol-Myers's Clairol subsidiary -- isn't allocating any advertising funds to its Great Day color gel for men this year. 
And most of Combe's other competitors are small companies with small marketing budgets. 
For example, Majestic Drug Co., which sells Youthair and Groom Away Gray for men, says it can afford only a little magazine advertising. 
Another gradual coloring treatment, EverYouth, also has suffered from low visibility. 
But the marketer of EverYouth plans to step up advertising this fall, using ex-boxing champion Rocky Graziano as spokesman. 
The ad slogan: "I knocked out gray with EverYouth."

STYLIST LORI DAVIS GIVES FAMOUS CLIENTS HIGH-PROFILE HAIR COLOR, PERMS AND CUTS 
</P>

<TEXT>

HOLLY HUNTER sits in the beauty shop chair, staring into the mirror and 
contemplating several hair styles. The actress is trying to find the best look 
for her next film, "Once Around," with Richard Dreyfuss. "Lori, whaddya think?" 
she asks in her decidedly Southern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new question to hairdresser Lori Davis, who colors, perms and 
cuts the hair of many a Hollywood star. In addition to Hunter, Davis' clients 
include Meryl Streep, who visits between films to have her natural pale-blond 
color restored; Cher, who comes in for perms, and Bette Midler, who had her 
hair dyed red for "Beaches" and blond for "Stella." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' work isn't limited to women. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a 
regular at Lori Davis Hair Doctor since his "Conan the Barbarian" days. Nick 
Nolte insists on having Davis flown to his film locations to match his hair 
color and style to his role. Sean Penn and Tom Cruise drop in for trims. And 
"Cheers" star Ted Danson, who gets a Davis cut and conditioning every two 
weeks, comes in for color as well when he needs it for film work. "To make his 
hair look its natural shade on the big screen," Davis says, "we have to make it 
a little darker than how he wears it on television." 
</P>
<P>
Davis may handle more superstar tresses on a regular basis than any other salon 
stylist in Southern California, yet she manages to do so without Tinseltown 
trappings. In fact, her salon is pure down-home. "They (celebrities) don't come 
here for ambiance," says Davis, her own long, blond hair framing her face. The 
16x16-foot room she rents in the Brentwood Continental salon in West Los 
Angeles is separated from the rest of the shop by a rattling, wooden sliding 
door. Paper teddy bears festoon the mirror. Davis' cosmetology licenses, 
plaques with cute sayings and a promotional photo signed "with love" from 
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito (who, she says, met in her salon) adorn the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the actors and actresses who come to this funky little workroom to 
entrust their hair to Davis have been referred by other actors or by studio 
hairdressers, who also depend on Davis' expertise with color and other chemical 
hair treatments. "My hair was destroyed after I did 'Miss Firecracker,' " 
Hunter recalls, "and Lori saved it." During the making of that film about three 
years ago, Hunter's hair was dyed red several times, which stripped it of its 
moisture and sheen. So Davis restored the actress's natural shade of brown and 
used deep conditioners to bring back its soft texture. "She's been with me ever 
since," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Davis introduced her own line of hair-care products, Designers' Mane 
Collection, which uses many of the same formulas she has applied on her famous 
clients. The stars can buy her products in her workroom; the products are 
available to the public at Frends Beauty Supply Co. in North Hollywood and 
through mail-order. 
</P>
<P>
For many celebrities, Davis has found, extra conditioning is important. NBC 
news correspondent Maria Shriver gets frequent moisturizing treatments to keep 
her hair shiny under drying studio lights. "Cheers" star Rhea Perlman's hair 
requires constant care to keep it looking curly rather than out of control. 
"Now that it's shoulder length, she has versatility," Davis explains, "but 
keeping it shiny requires regular deep-conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, stars will ask Davis for a totally new look. If they are between 
films or TV shows, she'll indulge the whim. For instance, about five years ago, 
she transformed Cher's dark mane to "a punked-out blond," Davis remembers. "We 
cut it all off into a crew cut and bleached it almost white, but that meant 
constant touch-ups. Unless you have plenty of time for upkeep, going from dark 
brown to blond is torture -- and expensive." She gave Cher the same advice she 
gives other brunettes: "Don't be a blonde unless you can afford the time and 
money to touch up every two weeks." Cher was back to her natural brown in less 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Davis calls herself one of a vanishing breed of hairdressers: "You know, the 
ones who do everything -- without assistants -- who shampoo and color and perm 
and cut." She does concede, though, that she doesn't do blow-dries: "After 23 
years with a hairbrush in my hand, my wrists hurt." But it doesn't seem to 
matter because Davis' cuts fall perfectly into place as clients wield their own 
hair dryers, and the color of their locks shines so naturally that one wonders 
if Davis ever, well, goofs. 
</P>
<P>
"No, honey, I don't fail," she says. "If I were to fail, I'd fail big."

root and dark at the tip?;      GRAY HAIRS SEEM TO HAVE THIS MYSTErious way of

<TEXT>     But what really happens is, the pigment in a given follicle is slowly
diluted as a person gets older. There is no sudden cutoff of pigment, and so
you never see a hair that goes abruptly from black to white or from brown to
gray. The transition is usually too subtle to notice unless you're really
checking yourself out.;    "You should be able to see a hair that has both
dark and light in it," says Andrew Atton, dermatologist at the Johns Hopkins
school of medicine.;    Now then: What about Marie Antoinette, who supposedly
went gray overnight as she awaited execution? How did that happen?;    In
Marie's case, the answer may be simply that she was locked up for a while and
ran out of her hair coloring. In other, more credible cases of extremely rapid
graying, what may happen is that the pigmented hairs fall out over the course
of a couple of weeks, leaving the white or gray hairs that are already there.
According to the textbook Diseases of the Hair and Scalp, by Arthur Rook and
Rodney Dawber, this may be a quirky result of the hair follicle disease
"alopecia areata," but it is basically still a mystery.;    It's more fun to
think Marie was just scared pigmentless.;     GUESS AGAIN; LOTS OF PEOPLE,

   The chatter resembles that of any beauty
salon. Women tease each other about their ages and their graying
hair as they sit under hair dryers and flip through timeworn
magazines.
   Posters of the latest hairstyles cover the battered walls, and
the pungent odor of the solution used for permanents fills the air.
   The tools of the beauty trade at the medium-security
Florence-Crane Women's Facility are nothing special, but they're of
some concern. Scissors, electric razors and chemicals can be
dangerous - especially in the hands of convicted criminals.
   Some of these women are locked up for life. Some can receive no
visitors. But still, inmates say, the prison beauty shop serves an
essential purpose.
   ``Everyone feels better, even if they've had a bad day,'' said
beautician Diane Carter, serving 20 years on drug and escape
charges. ``It's just like going shopping - you get depressed and
you go shopping.''
   ``It's not a privilege. It's a necessity for a lot of us,'' said
Sherron Butler, who is serving up to 14 years for writing bad
checks and escape.
   ``We're also still human beings and if you love yourself, you're
going to take care of yourself. When I got here, I said, `Great,
they have a beauty shop. I can continue to be me.'''
   Butler was getting this season's favorite style, the $25 wave
nouveau. In addition to the curl, she often comes in to have her
hair colored - autumn mist is her shade - and to buy cocoa butter
lotion.
   Rather than chip off her nail polish, she can spend a quarter to
dip her fingers and toes in nail polish remover. Inmates can have
nail polish outside the shop, but the remover contains alcohol and
stays put.
   The shop has its regulars, but most inmates cut each other's
hair in the housing units, where they're permitted to check out
blunt-ended scissors.
   Each state prison has a hair care area where inmate barbers are
supervised by a civilian cosmetologist, said Gail Light, a
spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Corrections.
   In federal prisons, basic haircuts are free, said Dan Dunne,
assistant public information officer for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons
in Washington, D.C. Inmates who want something special, like a perm
or dye, can buy the materials at a commissary and bring them to the
prison's cosmetology unit for application, he said.
   The beauty shop at the Florence-Crane facility is cramped. One
authentic cosmetology chair is joined by a host of outdated barber
equipment bought used or donated. Hairdryers line the wall near the
window sill, where a newly arrived air conditioner blows comfort on
feverish, summer days.
   Mildred Perry, one of four inmate beauticians, remembers
converting the space from junk room to beauty shop when she was
transferred to Florence-Crane in 1985.
   ``There was a desperate need for a beauty shop,'' said Perry,
who is serving a life term for second-degree murder. ``We knew the
self-esteem would go down. They didn't care about themselves any
more.
   ``This was the only chair, there was one working spigot with
cold water and one bucket. It just grew and grew. We had to get a
crochet needle to pull the hair through the cap for the first
frostin job we did.''
   Most of the cosmetology unit's operating costs are covered by
what they charge customers, and its prices are competitive with
outside shops. A price list hangs near the rinse sink: $14 for
``jazzing color,'' $20 for a frosted perm, $6 for hot oil and
condition treatment, $5 for a plain cut.
   Money never changes hands. Women contact the cosmetology unit
for an appointment, and the civilian cosmetologist, who operates
mostly as an observer, checks their accounts to make sure they have
enough.
   The shop in the main prison is open two days a week, and the
four prisoners serve about a dozen customers each day. An annex
salon is open Saturdays.
   Some of the workers had cosmetology experience before being sent
to the prison. Others picked it up in prison. Inmates have asked
for a certification program so they'll be able to get cosmetology
jobs when they leave prison, but there is no money to pay for it.
   The beauticians, who get $1.50 a day and a free hairdo a month,
must hand in their nurse-like smocks and are searched before they
leave work, said assistant deputy warden Terri Baker.
   No incidents other than minor thefts have been reported,
probably because corrections officers and the civilian
cosmetologist always are watching.
   Beautician Serena Gordon, serving a life term for second-degree
murder, said she's never been threatened with violence by a
customer who didn't like the way her hair turned out.
   She recalled a young woman with black hair who wanted it
frosted.
   ``When I got done, she just started crying,'' Gordon said. ``She
didn't realize it was going to make her look that old.''
   Gordon also gave a professional bleach job to another inmate
whose hair temporarily turned green.
   ``That time,'' she said, ``I cried.''

LOOKS: A MAN'S EYES;

<P>
EVEN MACHO TYPES ARE ENHANCING LASHES, PLUCKING BROWS, CONCEALING BAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG FISHER, Craig Fisher is a frequent contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN ERNEST Hemingway first met Scott Fitzgerald in a Paris bar in 1925, he was 
struck by his rival's boyish good looks. Fitzgerald, he later wrote, had a 
delicate mouth and "excited and friendly eyes." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, throughout Fitzgerald's life, people remarked on his eyes. When he was 
a boy, they were described variously as green, blue or gray. And a Princeton 
friend remembered him as "the handsomest boy I've ever seen. He had yellow hair 
and lavender eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not all men are blessed with such mesmerizing features -- 
especially since many women say that a man's eyes are what they notice first. 
But eye-care specialists and grooming professionals say there are many things a 
man can do to enhance his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Makeup artist Mark Richard, whose clients have included Kirk Douglas and Robert 
Stack, thinks that if a man is being photographed for a wedding or a corporate 
brochure, he shouldn't hesitate to apply a little concealer to camouflage dark 
circles under his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But even a man who would never wear cosmetics, Richard says, should make sure 
that his eyes are well-groomed. "I'd start with what I call elephant-hair 
eyebrows," he says of the coarse hairs that sprout as a man gets older. 
"They're not only unflattering but aging." To get rid of them, he suggests, 
stroke each brow inward, toward the bridge of the nose, and then clip any stray 
hairs left standing. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, "it's true what your mother told you: Eyes that look too close 
together make a man look as if he can't be trusted." So a man whose brows run 
together may want to consider plucking them with tweezers, asking his 
haircutter to do it or having them waxed. 
</P>
<P>
Eyebrow waxing is available at numerous hair and skin-care salons. Catherine 
Wood is an independent facialist who works at the Cristophe salon in Beverly 
Hills and charges $12 to wax a man's brows. 
</P>
<P>
Wood also dyes eyelashes ($18) and uses a collagen pack to alleviate dryness 
around the eyes. "It's a sponge saturated with collagen liquid that I lay 
around the eyes at the end of a massage," she says. "It's $15 extra on top of a 
facial, which costs $60." While Wood acknowledges that "crow's-feet can look 
good on men," such lines can disturb some people's self-esteem. Hence, more and 
more cosmetics manufacturers are offering eye creams formulated to minimize 
wrinkles. Kiehl's Since 1851 is a venerable New York company whose products are 
available at selected retailers (Neiman Marcus and Fred Segal) and by mail. 
Among its products is Ultra Protection Moisturizing Eye Gel, with a sun 
protection factor of 18 (about $30). 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Heidegger, spokesman for men's division of Kiehl's, says that any man who 
engages in an outdoor sport should use at least a moisturizer, especially 
around the eyes, if he wants to forestall wrinkling. "Runners sweat," he says, 
"so they need to apply it more." Kiehl's also makes a water-resistant Mt. 
Everest '88 Expedition Sunscreen with an SPF of 18 (around $14), which 
Heidegger says is particularly good for skiing and sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities can also take their toll on a man's eyes. As he got older, the 
alcoholic Fitzgerald's eyes appeared bloodshot and bleary. But Dr. Peter 
McDonnell, an ophthalmologist at the Doheny Eye Institute at USC, says that "as 
part of the aging process, your eyes are a little less clear. You get little 
broken blood vessels in other parts of your body as well, but the conjunctiva 
(the mucous membrane that covers the front of the eyeball) being so thin, they 
show up in your eyes more." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell says that "some conjunctival changes -- raised spots, yellowish maybe 
-- are caused by ultraviolet-light exposure. So there seems to be a good 
rationale for wearing UV-absorbing sunglasses. And the effect seems to be 
cumulative, so the earlier you start using them, the better -- driving, skiing, 
on the beach, sailing." 
</P>
<P>
But if a man's eyes are merely betraying fatigue or overindulgence, McDonnell 
says, eye drops and other simple measures can help. "Some people find comfort 
with a cool washcloth," he says. "Coolness constricts blood vessels and can be 
soothing. It decreases swelling." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Richard insists that more men than one would ever suspect are using 
makeup to give Mother Nature a hand. At many beauty supply stores, he says, a 
man can buy black hair pomade and use a smear of it to darken and add luster to 
his lashes.

   NO DOUBT marketers will remember 1987 mostly for the stock market crash and its impact on consumer spending. 
But there were other lesser milestones in the world of marketing. 
It was the year in which Bud Light spokesdog Spuds MacKenzie became a media sensation . . . the TV network's prudish censors finally allowed women to wear bras in commercials . . . and an E.F. Hutton marketing executive tried to solve the brokerage firm's image and morale problems with a coloring book. 

   Those were just some of the topics covered here in recent months. 
Now on New Year's Eve, the marketing column updates a few of the subjects it explored in 1987: 

   THE REVIEWS ARE IN, and floppy disk advertising appears to be a hit. 
Both General Motors Corp.'s Buick division and Chase Manhattan Bank say they were quite pleased with the "software brochures" they used to reach personal-computer users. 
Chase put the sales spiel for its electronic funds transfer service on a computer disk, while a similar Buick disk included animated drawings of automobiles plus data about standard equipment, mileage and monthly car payments. 

   Buick had expected to distribute 20,000 disks to Apple computer users but ultimately mailed out 67,000. 
"We attracted many customers who aren't normally part of the Buick market," says Nancy Newell, manager of electronic product information for the car maker. 
"About 10% of the people we surveyed intended to buy a Buick after viewing the disk, and three-quarters of them were not current Buick owners." 
Next month, Buick will unveil even more elaborate software promoting its 1988 models. 

   While floppy disks are far from being an established medium, more advertisers are giving them a shot. 
SoftAd Group in Sausalito, Calif., has designed software to market Siemens Medical Systems' hospital equipment, and Creative Media Group in Parsippany, N.J., has developed a disk promoting Listerine to periodontists.

   THERE'S ANOTHER NEW ENTRY in the $47 million men's hair-coloring market: Bristol-Myers Co.'s Clairol subsidiary is testing a foamy product called Option on the West Coast. 
It is dispensed from a can much like shaving cream and gradually covers the gray after several applications. 
Option follows close behind last summer's introduction of Just for Men, a fast-acting dye from Combe Inc. 

   Clairol's marketing officials agree with Combe executives that the men's coloring market should take off in a few years when more baby boomers start to gray. 
"We hope to develop the men's category with Option, but it's going to take patience because many men really don't want to color their hair," says Bill Susetka, group director of new business development at Clairol. 
He adds that Clairol doesn't believe men want the immediate, noticeable color change they would get with a product like Combe's Just for Men. 

   For its part, Combe says Just for Men is "doing fine." 
But the company won't disclose any sales results.

   AFTER A SLOW START last spring, Adolph Coors Co. is making some heady market share gains in parts of New York and New Jersey. 
The company claims it has 6% to 8% of the upstate New York beer market, 7.5% to 9.5% in New York City and 14% to 18% in New Jersey. 
"We've got very good momentum after our first 10 months in these two big states," says Terry Nauslar, director of market expansion, "but we'll have to be even more focused and aggressive in 1988." 

   Indeed, beverage analysts note that Coors still is having difficulty penetrating New York's bars and restaurants. 
What's more, Mr. Nauslar says, Coors has riled Anheuser-Busch Cos. into action to defend Budweiser's market share. 
And he also frets that Corona Extra, a hot-selling Mexican beer, may roll into New York soon. 

   Pennsylvania and Delaware, meanwhile, are on tap to receive their initial Coors shipments in the first half of 1988. 
After that, Coors will have just one more frontier to invade: Indiana.

   TWO AMBITIOUS PROJECTS for importing Israeli food into the U.S. aren't exactly cooking. 
A New York concern called Ficom International Inc. had planned to import a variety of gourmet foods from Israel and market them under the brand name Betavon. 
But Ficom didn't receive the financial assistance it expected from Israel, and Betavon remains just a name on paper. 
Ficom has filed suit in federal court against the Israeli Export Institute, charging breach of contract. 

   John Roberts, president of I/AM Importing, the other Israeli food venture, acknowledges that progress has been much slower than expected. 
But he's optimistic about 1988. 
In fact, he says, I/AM just began representing its first company and is now importing Israeli turkey products under the brand name Yarden.

   FIFTEEN-SECOND COMMERCIALS keep gaining in popularity, accounting for 29% of network TV ads in the first nine months of 1987. 
That's up from 20% in the 1986 period, according to the TV Bureau of Advertising. 
A few national advertisers have switched entirely to 15s. 
For instance, the Ogilvy &amp; Mather ad agency just created an $18 million campaign for Pepperidge Farm that includes 13 different 15s. 
"We get more media exposure for our money," explains Ben Arno, a management supervisor at Ogilvy, "and we can focus on a lot more products and flavors with 13 separate ads."

FOR THE OLDER WOMAN, A BRUSHUP ON MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Makeup artist Margaret Avery dips into a big tote bag and pulls out her most 
precious tools: brushes of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the first thing a woman should own. Of course, not everyone needs 31," 
she notes after a quick count of her collection. 
</P>
<P>
Avery gets her brushes in art supply stores (the average woman buys hers at a 
cosmetics counter), and they have been skillfully flicked over the skin and 
bones of Hollywood screen stars, top fashion models and even First Lady Barbara 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
It was Avery who emphasized Mrs. Bush's cheekbones, played up her lips and 
played down her foundation for a flattering Time magazine cover portrait in 
1989 that ran with the headline, "The Silver Fox." 
</P>
<P>
The New-York-based specialist believes in the less-is-more school of makeup, 
and she says she did for Barbara Bush what she would do for any "older women" 
(that means over 40). She kept the foundation very pale so it wouldn't look 
heavy. She applied a dark-brown cream blusher, rather than red, for a more 
natural look. And she accentuated the First Lady's cheekbones with a 
peach-colored blusher, applied in a stroke that went from nose to hairline. 
</P>
<P>
To play up Mrs. Bush's "beautifully shaped mouth," she used a honey-brown 
foundation to soften a raspberry-colored lipstick worn over it. 
</P>
<P>
Avery's own mouth is splashed with a vivid red lip color. It is a matte shade, 
which she prefers to anything frosted for herself (she is 38) and more mature 
women. She explains that "frosted colors on older women tend to make the skin 
look puffy and more wrinkled." 
</P>
<P>
For a makeover on Helen Wasylciw, an attractive gray-haired woman who prefers 
no makeup, Avery applied a light layer of foundation and worked mostly around 
the eyes, explaining, "Her eyes droop a bit at the outer corners. Anyone with 
that problem should never use dark eye shadow or extend the eye shadow beyond 
the edge of the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Avery finds the two biggest makeup mistakes made by older women are: "wearing 
too much and not learning how to blend it so it looks as if they have barely 
any on." She strongly recommends women of any age wear a moisturizer and a sun 
block under makeup. 
</P>
<P>
A fan of drugstore cosmetics, Avery used several for her makeovers, including 
Complex 15 moisturizer (for which she recently toured the United States, 
stopping briefly in Los Angeles) and Cover Girl mascara. But when she wants an 
instant pick-me-up, she treats herself to an expensive lipstick or eye shadow 
(Prescriptives is a favorite brand). Or a new compact. To have that ritzy 
little object in her handbag, she says, "is like wearing a gorgeous lacy bra."

BOB BARKER WINS THE GAME OF ENDURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While most game-show hosts come and go, fading as quickly as their wrinkles 
appear, one man has managed to survive for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Barker, 66, spent 18 years as host of "Truth or Consequences" and is about 
to begin his 19th season as emcee of CBS' venerable "The Price Is Right." 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," Barker said. "What's even more amazing than the longevity is 
that it's the highest-rated game show." 
</P>
<P>
Barker was still hosting the syndicated nighttime version of "Truth or 
Consequences" when he began his duties on "Price Is Right." 
</P>
<P>
"It never entered my mind that I would do 'Price Is Right' longer than 'Truth 
or Consequences,' " Barker said, laughing. "It never entered my mind I would do 
anything longer. It never entered my mind I would even live longer." 
</P>
<P>
So why has "Price Is Right" been around for so long? 
</P>
<P>
"The reason it was so popular originally (it began in the '50s in a less glitzy 
version with Bill Cullen as host) and why it is still popular is because of the 
powerful basic premise of the show -- everything is based on prices," Barker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone identifies with prices. The minute we put something up for bid and 
the contestant makes a bid, the viewer is involved. Once you become involved, 
we have accomplished what the producer of every game show wants -- viewer 
involvement. 'The Price Is Right' has that to the nth degree." 
</P>
<P>
Though "Price Is Right" is taped, Barker does the show as if it were live. "The 
only editing we have ever done is for some technical problem. I think another 
reason for the success of the show is that it has a live feel." 
</P>
<P>
Contestants have come from around the world to be on "Price Is Right." And they 
are determined to be on the show, no matter what happens. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to the audience once during a break and a young woman in the 
audience began to have a baby," Barker said. "I turned to the pages and said, 
'Will you help her out?' This woman said, 'I don't want to go, you might call 
my name.' Now can you believe it? I said, 'Madam, we are not going to call any 
more names until you are on your way to the hospital.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though most of the veteran game-show hosts complain that producers are looking 
for younger faces to host shows, Barker said the "Price Is Right" ratings 
improved when he let his hair go gray. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prematurely gray," he said. "I began to gray at my temples, and I guess 
it could be that technology at that time was not what it is today, but I didn't 
look good. It looked like I had no hair at my temples, so they suggested I tint 
it." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Barker used tint until the tint made his hair blue. Then someone 
suggested he dye his hair, which eventually turned red. 
</P>
<P>
"I went on vacation and I just let it go," he said. "When I came home the 
people on the show said, 'You look better this way than you do with it dyed or 
tinted. Why don't you leave it this way?' " 
</P>
<P>
Barker started to chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"We taped ahead," he said. "So let's say on the Wednesday show I had dark hair, 
but when we taped the next show I had gray hair and that show aired on 
Thursday. I got a letter from a fellow who said, 'Bob, you must have had one 
hell of a night.' " SUSAN KING

<LEADPARA>  Q How does fruit ripen once it is off the tree?;    A Fruit can ripen after it
is picked because everything necessary for ripening is either stored or made
inside the fruit. But that is true only if the fruit isn't picked too early.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Science &amp; Medicine  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FRAGILE CHEMISTRY YIELDS SWEETNESS, COLOR
TASTIEST FRUITS ARE TREE-RIPENED  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Q&amp;A  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Four things happen to most ripening fruits: They sweeten, develop their
special flavors, soften and change color.;    All of these are biochemical
processes set off by a ripening hormone. In most non-citrus fruits, that
hormone is ethylene, and it is made inside the fruit itself, according to John
Labavitch, a biochemist at the University of California, Davis, who studies
the ripening process.;    As the fruit ripens, starches stored in the fruit
are converted to sugars. Acids are destroyed, which also adds to the
sweetness. But that's not all there is to taste. The ripening fruit also
produces a unique mix of flavor chemicals that make a peach taste like a
peach, and a pear like a pear.;    At the same time, the fruit grows soft,
thanks to special enzymes that partially break down the rigid walls
surrounding the fruit's cells.;    Other enzymes destroy the fruit's green
chlorophyll, and new pigments take the chlorophyll's place: Anthocyanins make
apples red and plums blue, and carotenoid pigments create the orange-red of a
ripe tomato.;    Fruits can ripen normally off the plant if they are fully
mature when they are picked, said Labavitch, but they may never get as sweet
as those that ripen on the plant, which continue to be infused with sugar as
they ripen. Fruit that is picked too young may not have developed to the point
where it is able to ripen right, or at all.;    Q I have begun getting white
hairs above my ears. They are kinkier than the rest of my hair. Will I
eventually have a head of frizzy white hair?;    A Researchers aren't sure
what makes some people's hair change texture when it goes gray. And it's hard
to say, based on a few hairs, how big a texture change you can expect.;    The
texture of your hair is determined in part by the shape of your hair
follicles, the little tubes in your skin from which the hair grows. Large
follicles produce coarse hair, while small follicles grow finer hair. Asians
have round, straight follicles, giving them straight, round hairs, while
blacks have flattened follicles that produce flattened hairs with a kinky
texture. Some people have curved follicles, which give them curly or wavy
hair.;    Hair texture is also affected by chemical properties of the keratin
protein that makes up the hair shaft.;    Your hair gets its color from
pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. As you grow older, the melanocytes
in some follicles will stop making pigment, and the hairs that grow from those
follicles will be white. The more white hairs you have, the grayer your hair
looks.;    Hair sometimes changes texture as it goes gray, but there has been
little research into why this is so, according to Kurt Stenn, a dermatologist
who studies hair at Yale University School of Medicine. It may be that in some
cases the melanocyte shut-down causes a change in the shape of the hair
follicle, or in the chemistry of the keratin protein.;    These changes could
occur in all or just some of your hair follicles, Stenn said, so it is hard to
say how dramatically different your silvering hair will be.  </TEXT>

   BOTKINS, Ohio -- Angie Cisco got it after her water
softener broke down. Becky Thatcher came down with it while
working as a lifeguard.
   Their malady: orange hair. And it's going around. Some
cases are minor-split-ends turning copperish, and such. More
severe attacks, mainly experienced by blondes, turn flaxen
locks a brassy red. This isn't pretty.

   "I used to dye my hair red, but I don't have to here,"
sighs Sara Kjellmert, a 17-year-old exchange student from
Sweden.
   But don't call in the Food and Drug Administration. This
is one condition with a known cause (though it also has a
dubious cure). The culprit is hard water, water with a heavy
mineral content found in wells throughout rural America. The
stuff, they say, is safe to drink, but in the shower minerals
latch onto strands of hair and leave deposits of iron, lime
or magnesium.
   Like garden tools or an old Chevy, hair can oxidize,
redden and rust. The heavy buildup develops particularly
among women who have had perms full of chemicals or who use
highlighting paste on their hair. Teen-agers, who wash their
hair a lot, are particularly prey to the orange peril.
   Battling rust buildup is a daily struggle for the four
beauty salons in Botkins, a tiny farming town 50 miles north
of Dayton. Put on a little perm solution and rinse, and just
watch the deep-purple water flow like Manischewitz. One young
woman had her blonde hair highlighted and saw it turn gray.
"It's scummy, it's dandruffy, and there's no shine to the
hair," says Darla Berning, who owns the Village Salon.
   The problem is by no means unique to this area. High
concentrations of hard water minerals stretch from upstate
New York to Montana, and particularly around the Great Lakes
region. For people who live in cities where water is treated,
this is a non-issue.
   That's even the case for the 1,200 residents of Botkins.
It's those who live outside of town who tend to develop this
red badge of corrosion. Getting a water softener and calling
the Culligan man helps, if you can afford the tanks and the
chemicals and the regular servicing.
   Still, there's a Rust Belt that cuts a swath through the
hair curlers of rural America.
   "I don't like being a redhead," says Shelly Zitzelsberger
of Stockbridge, Wis., whose true hair color is light brown.
"I mean, it's not that color makes a difference, but I want
my color back."
   What to do? Ah, there's the rub.
   Many things have been tried, including vinegar, baking
soda, skin cleansers, hydrogen peroxide, shampoos,
conditioners and clarifiers. Missy Grieves, a Botkins High
School junior with flowing blonde hair, has had limited
success with distilled water, lemon juice and salt. Miss
Thatcher, a 19-year-old blonde who became a redhead, has
since dyed her hair brown, voiding the issue.
   Some Botkins residents are resigned to their fate. Red
hair is just part of living in a community where a big feed
mill spews corn dust and the only motel is next to a pig
farm.
   But other people are desperate to get the rust out. And in
recent years, some people in these parts of south central
Ohio have been using a product called The Works, which
contains just enough hydrochloric acid to do the job. It's
controversial, among other reasons, because the product is
made to remove toilet-bowl rust, and, besides that, it is
poisonous. It says so in bold, black letters across the
bottle, and the label expands on the theme: "May Be Fatal If
Swallowed. Causes Severe Burns. Vapor Harmful."
   But it would take more than dire warnings to deter Sharon
Klosterman, who has been shooting The Works on her hair every
six months for several years. Wearing rubber gloves, the
33-year-old mother of three mixes two ounces of the
toilet-cleaner with two ounces of water, then sluices it
through her rusty blonde hair.
   She doesn't let the solution touch her scalp. "I just put
it in and rinse it out," she says. "It's never done any
damage to my hair." It's toxic, but it gets the rust out.
   Mrs. Klosterman, who works in quality control at a nearby
Honda plant, says many of her friends have also taken the
cure. One 26-year-old blonde, who lives outside Botkins, says
she started using the toilet-bowl cleaner on her hair four
months ago after she tired of being called "carrot top." The
friend who recommended The Works to her, she says, told her
not to be concerned if her hair started to smoke. She says
that hasn't happened.
   The testimonials go on and on, from people pleased with
the results and blase about the peril.
   But the product's manufacturer is very concerned about its
misapplication. Lime-O-Sol Co. in Ashley, Ind., said it first
heard that The Works was being used as a personal-care
product last month, and the only reports the company has had
have come from south-central Ohio. "We prefer that our
cleaning products only be used for cleaning, and we encourage
people to read labels," says Therese Stantz, supervisor of
sales and customer service. "This was definitely a first for
us."
   It isn't clear where the innovative new use for The Works
came from, or if that matters. Some attribute it to
teen-agers, others to Botkins beauticians. But the issue came
to a head last year when a beautician in Botkins, Connie
Mielke, was asked by a high-school student about using
toilet-bowl cleaner to get the red out. Mrs. Mielke, who owns
the Hairitage House here, says she was shocked. "Some of
these kids have used it for three years, and they say their
hair is fine, but believe you me, their hair is not fine." It
has lost protein, for one thing, she maintains.
   Mrs. Mielke began a crusade to discourage using The Works
-- then created a rhubarb when, in a local newspaper, she
called people who do "stupid." Some salon owners say she is
just trying to drum up business for herself.
   And many people hereabouts don't see much wrong with the
rust remover. Bartending at Meyer's Tavern, Rita Dorsten says
she figures beauticians have probably used toilet-bowl
cleaner on her blonde tresses. "It's no worse than perm
solution," she says, taking a drag on her cigarette. "That
stuff will burn your skin." In her opinion, "Anything that's
going to strip {the rust} out of your hair will be just as
hard" on it as something that burnishes porcelain.
   A product was introduced last year that is meant to get
mineral deposits out of hair. It is called Malibu 2000 and is
available only in salons. It is touted by its manufacturer in
Southern California as "a whole new approach to hair," and it
is endorsed by Jan Hodgin-States, the manager of a J.C.
Penney Styling Salon in Muncie, Ind. "It's the most effective
product I've ever used," she says.
   And it is now being pushed aggressively in the beauty
parlors of Botkins. But Mrs. Berning, of the Village Salon,
doesn't think it will necessarily catch on with the
inadvertent redheads who have come to rely on The Works.
"They're not going to pay for expensive products," she says,
"when they've been using that for years."

STYLISTS PUT A NEW FACE ON TRICKS WITH MAKEUP

<P>
Women who wish they could change certain features about their faces are 
starting to think of makeup artists in a new way -- as experts who can offer 
very specific advice that can postpone cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
How do you make lips look fuller without collagen injections, give eyes a lift 
without a surgeon's incisions, diminish the effect of wrinkles and lines 
without a chemical peel? These are the sorts of questions modern makeup artists 
answer by putting into practice the latest tricks of their trade. More than 
ever, they say, makeup used the right way will erase years from a woman's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
A private lesson in how it is done can be an expensive proposition -- an 
hourlong appointment, with a complete makeup application, usually costs $40 or 
more. So it is helpful to know ahead of time which expert to consult about 
which particular problem. And the experts all do have their special skills, 
just as restaurant chefs have certain dishes they prepare especially well. 
</P>
<P>
Four Los Angeles makeup artists recently demonstrated the techniques they are 
best known for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eugenia Weston of Senna Cosmetics, a Tarzana boutique, applies lipstick for 
maximum effect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joanna Fradkin of the Pigments boutique in Beverly Hills shapes eyebrows to 
frame and balance facial features. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andrea Kessel, who is based in the Joseph Martin hair salon in Beverly 
Hills, enhances the natural features of women over age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Brando of Vanity in Los Angeles teaches women to apply eyeliner in 
ways that seem to alter the shape of their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
To create the perfect lips, Weston has developed a process that minimizes very 
wide shapes, or maximizes narrow ones. It involves several steps. 
</P>
<P>
First, she covers the area around the lips with a jojoba-based cream to soften 
lines and help the lipstick adhere. For narrow lips, she blends an off-white 
color highlighter above the mouth only to create a light-reflecting area that 
makes the lips seem more prominent. 
</P>
<P>
She outlines top and bottom lips with a pencil, drawing along the outer line of 
narrow lips, or the inner line of very full lips, rounding the line for a 
fuller effect on narrow lips, or making it slightly concave to cut in on very 
wide lips. 
</P>
<P>
She completely colors the lips with the same pencil before she applies 
lipstick. The colors should match, she says. And she explains that pale colors 
minimize and darker colors maximize the fullness of the lips. 
</P>
<P>
Weston applies lipstick with a padded lamb's wool "smoothie" that looks like a 
small gumdrop on a stick and can be found in beauty-supply stores. It gives a 
more natural, matte finish, instead of a shiny one. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler, one of her best customers, is also one of her ideal students. 
Following Weston's direction, Midler makes the most of her full lips with a 
pale lip color applied for a matte look. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pigments boutique, Fradkin tells clients their eyebrows are the most 
important feature of their face. Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor are two 
leading examples of famous brows that have enhanced a face. 
</P>
<P>
Well-shaped eyebrows, tapered to form a near-straight line that extends to just 
beyond the eyes' outer corner, can give droopy or hooded eyes an uplifted and 
pronounced appearance, Fradkin explains. 
</P>
<P>
To shape a brow, she draws parallel lines along the top and the bottom of it, 
using an off-white color pencil. The top and bottom lines angle slightly upward 
and are about the same length. Then she draws a line from the curve of the 
temple to the top of the eyebrow, to tell her where the arch point should be. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with a taupe-colored pencil, she fills in the eyebrow, shaping it as 
she wants it to be, and clears away hairs that lie outside that ideal shape. 
Then she brushes the brow upward and trims the top hairs with a pair of fine 
scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"A good rule of thumb is to tweeze from the arch out," she says. "People think 
that tweezing close to the nose gives them a wide-eyed look but it is really 
just unnatural looking. Anything that doesn't follow the bone structure is 
unflattering." 
</P>
<P>
For bare spots in eyebrows, and for very light-color brows, Fradkin fills in 
with a taupe pencil, using short strokes. She follows that by brushing the 
brows to smudge the color for a more natural look. 
</P>
<P>
She uses the neutral taupe shade, by the way, even on dark brunettes. "If the 
color is too dark the eyebrow gets out of balance with the rest of the face," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing the eyes with the rest of the face, and emphasizing their shape and 
color, is one of makeup's primary benefits. Kessel, at the Joseph Martin salon, 
does this with a few well-chosen colors, lightly applied. 
</P>
<P>
A number of her customers are over age 40. The natural lines and wrinkles in 
their complexions, their naturally lighter hair color and their softer-edged 
features look best when covered with a light-handed makeup, she explains. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in her system for making up the eyes is to brush the lids with 
pale peach-color powder, forming a light-color background for shades to come. 
"The pale background makes the eye look bigger," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Next she brushes a dusty rose shade into the crease of the eye and along the 
bone, and blends the color upward, toward the brow. She adds a bronze-color 
powder to the crease in the lid, and blends it. And she uses neutral-toned 
powder eyeliner, dotting it between the lashes and smudging it. She coats them 
with a soft, brown-plum mascara. She uses no dark colors and draws no solid 
lines, because both are harsh looking and add years to a woman's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
And she works with matte powders only. "Iridescents emphasize every line" she 
says. She also explains why her natural-looking makeup requires a number of 
steps. "What takes the most time is blending colors smoothly, to emphasize the 
contours or the bone structure and bring out the skin and eye colors." 
</P>
<P>
At the Vanity boutique, Brando is a master at applying eyeliner, a technique 
she uses to create all sorts of illusions. She uses dry powders, not liquid 
liners, because the liquid line tends to look dense and solid. 
</P>
<P>
Extend a line beyond the outer edge of small, close-set eyes and they seem to 
become elongated, she says. Outline the corner of the eyes only, in a warm 
brown color, and narrow eyes suddenly appear rounder and wider. Draw a 
deep-colored line on the inner rim of the lid and protruding eyes seem to lose 
their bulging appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Brando usually prefers eyeliners in neutral shades of brown that don't compete 
with the eye's color. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say there are no unattractive women, only lazy women," she says. 
"Everyone can learn how to apply their makeup to bring out their own best 
features."

HIGHLIGHTING IS THE NAME OF THE GAME, EVEN FOR THOSE WHO WERE BORN BLOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
AT A TIME when hair colorists around the world are declaring warm-toned brown 
tresses the latest and greatest, along comes Kim Basinger, a golden-haired 
goddess seemingly thumbing her nose at the trend. As Batman's heartthrob, Vicki 
Vale, Basinger is Hollywood's quintessential blonde, her hair the brightest 
spot in sinister Gotham City. 
</P>
<P>
Even for a born blonde like Basinger, highlighting is key to a lustrous mane. 
The actress's Manhattan-based colorist, Louis Licari, touched-up her hair four 
times during four months of filming. "In 'Batman,' Kim had to be everyone's 
blond fantasy, so her hair had to be perfect. But most highlighting needs to be 
done only once every three months," says Licari, who also lightens the locks of 
Jessica Lange,Christie Brinkley,Rosanna Arquette, Kate Capshaw,Faye Dunawayand 
Lauren Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
When Licari adds highlights -- a service for which he charges $250 -- he 
concentrates on the top layers, leaving the hair underneath darker to give the 
illusion of depth. "On Basinger's light hair, the contrast is subtle," he says. 
"We just wanted to reflect more light." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, says Licari, a consultant for Clairol, is placement of the 
highlights. Rather than adding color in an even application, he places it 
randomly, in bold strokes around the head, "to make the hair look sun 
streaked." 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, Jane Paddon,colorist and co-owner of The Burton Way 
Salon,says highlighting only the top layers of hair also means easier 
maintenance. "The more it grows out, the more natural it looks," Paddon 
explains. "Any sort of a bleached look is absolutely finished," she adds, 
noting that golden, reddish and honey blonds -- as well as lighter, creamy 
blonds -- have replaced harsh platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Fleming, a Beverly Hills salon owner, says that Southern California 
blondes, once known for their natural-looking sun-streaked hair, have lost 
their appeal by continually adding more color during touch-ups. "The overall 
effect is too light, especially when the sun continues to bleach it. They've 
gotten too brassy -- they look fake," he says. So Fleming places tints a shade 
darker on the hair adjacent to the highlights. "The contrast adds warmth and 
makes it look brighter, more natural," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Many women with highlighted hair are concerned with maintaining a consistent 
shade, but Licari, who highlights about 60 manes a week, says they shouldn't 
be: "It's natural to have the color change from season to season. Blonds always 
get lighter in summer." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Lapin, who bleached Marilyn Monroe's hair from dark ashblond to light 
platinum in the early '50s, complains that highlighting has dulled Hollywood's 
blondes. "It's just not as glamorous as when they were all platinum," he says. 
But the new Hollywood doesn't agree. Blond a la Basinger is its current ideal. 
Just ask Batman.

<P>
CUTTING EDGE: HAIRSTYLE TRENDS ARE OUT, INDIVIDUALITY IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAWN STONE, Dawn Stone is a senior at El Toro High School, where she is 
editor of the student news magazine, The BullETin, Keywanette treasurer and a 
member of the Academic Decathlon team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teen-agers on the cutting edge are scissoring, shaving and dyeing their hair, 
and individual tastes and desires are taking precedence over clone cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids aren't as trendy as they used to be," said Rory LaBahn, a stylist at 
Headlines Hair Studio in El Toro. "If one person has it, they all don't get it. 
They're more individual now, but they won't go totally out of that realm of 
acceptability." 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Cory Bentley, 16, a senior at Mission Viejo High School, aim for a 
style both original and functional. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to cut it really short because I have 28 minutes to get ready in the 
morning before swimming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her hair, which used to be a perm with past-the-shoulders length, is now cut in 
a distinctive style: one side has close layers, the other long layers down to 
the middle of the ear with a gradual step from one side to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said, though, that short hair is not too popular among the girls at her 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are trying to grow their hair out, to get it wavy and one length 
-- about six inches past their shoulders," she said. "I guess most people like 
long hair because it looks more feminine. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys have a complex about short hair," she laughed. "(They think) it doesn't 
make their girlfriends look feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaBahn: "You see very few short haircuts for teen-agers. Some of them, 
though, are pretty fashionable, and they feel confident enough to go with short 
hair. A lot of those short, little wedgie haircuts are in." 
</P>
<P>
About long-haired teen-agers, LaBahn said: "A lot of them like perms, spiral 
perms. They've been out for a while, but now that everyone knows about them a 
little bit more, a lot of people want them." 
</P>
<P>
Leah Vu, 16, an El Toro High sophomore, chose not to follow the long, perm 
look. Her hair had been in a plain, bowl cut; however, now it features long, 
magenta-colored bangs, a close shave underneath and a shoulder-length top 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick and tire of having the same style and everything else seemed so 
boring and mundane," she said. "It's so much easier this way. Besides, I think 
blue, purple and pink are so much prettier than black, brown or blond." 
</P>
<P>
And how do her parents react to magenta hair? 
</P>
<P>
"At first they said I better dye it back or they'd cut it all off," Vu said. 
"They've kind of gotten used to it now." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaBahn: "(Teen-agers) pretty much stay out of color (for their hair). 
Parents don't really go for it. A lot of times, too, the affordability keeps 
kids away." Coloring can cost $25 to $35 each time it's applied, and colored 
hair needs to be touched up every month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lewis, owner and stylist at The Endz in Orange, said, "We don't do a 
lot of wild cuts like we used to. You can't get a job with purple hair." 
</P>
<P>
Black-dyed hair has clouded over the rainbow colors. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Merriot, a 16-year-old El Toro junior, dyed his curly, light-brown hair an 
inky black and shaved the sides very close, leaving a mop of curls that spill 
onto his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the sides curly, so I shaved them myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other teen-agers who sport nonconformist hairstyles, Merriot says his 
cut is not inspired by musical tastes or heroes. However, it can't be denied 
that music does inspire some scissors work. 
</P>
<P>
O.J. Flowers, a 15-year-old freshman at El Toro, said that in his quest for a 
new hairstyle he "saw The Boys' haircut and really liked it." 
</P>
<P>
"My friends gave me ideas, and then I chose my own style," said Flowers, who 
decided on two shaved lines running along the side, with a clump of bangs in 
front and a close cut all the way around. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Brookman, a 17-year-old senior at El Toro, wanted short lines shaved on 
the side of his head -- two on the left and one on the right. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked (the stylist), 'Is this pretty popular?' and she said, 'No, no one's 
doing it anymore,' so I went for it," he said. "Besides, being that the track 
season is coming up, I had to have it short, and I wanted to put some style in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaBahn: "A lot of times, (this is) the age that you first start 
experimenting with your hair. Once you've cut your hair, you're fine. Then 
you're on the road to trying different things." 
</P>

LOOKS: POWER HAIR DO'S AND DON'TS; 
</P>
<P>
HOW HAIR MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN WINNING FRIENDS AND INFLUENCING PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates is a frequent contributor to this 
column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Power: How to get it, and how to let people know you've got it, are motivations 
that fuel this country. And "power hair" is definitely one of the surest ways 
to project or bolster an image; it identifies -- even for those who don't 
follow the game -- who's on first. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean you have to rush out and get the 'do du jour. "I don't think 
power hair has anything to do with fashion," says Kenneth, the legendary New 
York society hairdresser who has coiffed fashion icons such as the late Babe 
(Mrs. William) Paley and Jacqueline Onassis. "You usually find power hair on 
the heads of people who are pretty sure of who they are," he says. And while 
the actual profile of a power head varies from individual to individual, there 
are a number of common denominators. "Power hair is usually very neat," he 
explains. "It looks clean and expensive. And it's very well cut, if nothing 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Power styles vary from city to city. What's powerful in Los Angeles might look 
overpowering in Washington (where, with very few exceptions, the influential 
pay little attention to the vagaries of fashion) and simply silly in New York. 
Georgette Mosbacher, wife of the secretary of commerce, sports a flamboyant red 
coif, for example, that is more Beverly Hills than Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington often sets the standard for politically powerful hair: Jack 
Kennedy, our first telegenic president, definitely had it. His youthful, 
chestnut locks emphasized a break with the buzz-cut establishment and spawned a 
bevy of imitators. Former cabinet secretary Jack Kemp's Kennedy-esque coif did 
him no harm with the voters; nor did former California Sen. John Tunney suffer 
as a result of his thatch. Jesse Jackson, on the other hand, sets a power-hair 
precedent -- his inky waves complement his forceful, often theatrical profile. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush has power hair that is in total sync with who he is: His gracefully 
aging profile, with its lanky athleticism and receding hairline, bespeaks 
generations of wealth and breeding -- summer homes, yachts and private tennis 
courts. Which, of course, is the stuff of which he's made. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably testimony to Ronald Reagan's personal persuasiveness that he was 
able to project a powerful aura -- despite his arcane, pomaded pompadour. And 
dye is usually a distinct power-hair no-no, but tell that to Sen. Strom 
Thurmond (R-S.C.), "the senator with the hair color of the month," notes one 
Washington insider. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan's aggressively sprayed and back-combed Bistro Gardens look was 
powerful while the Reagans were, but, according to one observer, it "has 
returned to the wealthy suburbia from when it came. Thank God." In its place is 
Barbara Bush's defiantly gray mane, which might be considered dowdy on nearly 
anyone else but which earned her an admiring sobriquet: the Silver Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy-hitters in the business world usually sport a variation of John Malloy's 
dress-for-success look, but there are exceptions: Donald Trump's long, 
disarrayed honey-blondness works because his personality is equally outrageous. 
(Estranged-wife Ivana's brassy old bouffant was not powerful, but her new 
Bardot-ish buttery upsweep definitely is.) David Rockefeller's slicked-back, 
no-bother look suggests that he has more important things than hair to worry 
about in running a financial dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Power hair on Angelenos is harder to categorize: Creative Artists Agency 
president and CEO Mike Ovitz has it, because, as one producer points out, 
"every goddamn thing on Mike Ovitz is, de facto, powerful." Jack Valenti's 
splendidly silver hair is definitely powerful -- he looks as if he should be 
deciding the fate of movies' ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Media personalities are acutely aware of the believability quotient and have, 
by and large, sincere, if not flawless, hair. Dan Rather's side-parted 
salt-and-pepper coif is carefully boyish (although viewers watching his 
coverage of the Bay Area earthquake last year discovered that he's going bald 
on top); ABC anchor Peter Jennings' hairline is clearly receding (the studio 
stylist is going through mighty machinations to comb it forward and over), and 
NBC's Tom Brokaw's hair, though often barely kempt, is all there and graying 
nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful male hair in network television is the most-often 
ridiculed: Ted Koppel's. The "Nightline" anchor's coppery helmet has been 
likened to Howdy Doody's. Measured against the prevailing fashion wisdom, 
Koppel's head may look a little silly, but it is immediately identifiable -- 
and different from his competition's, which means power in his industry. 
</P>
<P>
Network women are not allowed such flexibility. It's widely accepted that 
network execs are still looking for blond beauties. The early ascendancy of 
such reporters as Lesley Stahl, Diane Sawyer and the late Jessica Savitch 
indicates that maybe the folks at Clairol knew what they were talking about -- 
not only do blondes have more fun, but they also get to be substitute anchors 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Lesley Stahl has made a curious fashion statement lately -- her fair, fine hair 
is blown into an anachronistic bouffant. "She likes big hair, and she's the 
boss," says Stahl's stylist, Robin Weir, who also did Nancy Reagan's hair. And 
maybe she knows something we don't. "I've been blowing up more heads this month 
than I have in years," Weir says. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the blond requirement soon may be nothing but a bitter 
memory. The most popular -- and powerful -- woman in network TV at the moment 
is the once-blond Jane Pauley, who, in her last year of the "Today" show, 
quietly returned to her natural light-brown color. And voters in the Washington 
Journalism Review last year gave high marks to two other non-blondes: Maria 
Shriver and Meredith Vieira. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Hollywood, however, blond ambition still reigns. Meryl Streep and 
Monroe-like Madonna are tops at the box office. Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler 
(who alternates between blond and reddish-blond) run their own production 
companies. "Entertainment Tonight" anchors Mary Hart and John Tesh are blonds, 
as is star "ET" field reporter Leeza Gibbons. Some things never change. 
</P>
<P>
Others do, and with great caprice. For a while, ponytails for men were the 
rage. Now the only person who sports one without looking passe is Peter Guber 
(of the Guber-Peters duo that now runs Columbia). Arsenio Hall's extreme 
haircut -- nude sides, flattop -- insists that middle America accept him on his 
terms, which it has. 
</P>
<P>
Power hair has been around since Sampson, and, as with every rule, there is one 
exception: One of the most powerful heads in Los Angeles belongs to super-agent 
Swifty Lazar -- who is totally bald.

OVER-35 WOMEN ARE DISCOVERING THE APPEAL OF LETTING THEIR YEARS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kim Yumiko Nagatani, Claire Kendall and Margaret Sargent are professional 
models caught up in one of America's biggest trends. At 38, 50 and 61, 
respectively, they're part of the collective aging of America, which is quickly 
taking the emphasis off youth. By 1996, more than half of the U.S. population 
will be over 35, according to the Census Bureau. But already the monumental 
shift in demographics is making a major impact on culture and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandmothers are suddenly the rage, so I'm doing more modeling," notes 
Sargent, who frequently poses for commercials and ads. Kendall and Nagatani say 
that they're working about twice as much as they did last year. "There are a 
lot of women out there who are my age," Kendall says. "They want to feel that 
it's OK to age, as long as you look your best. So older models are in demand." 
</P>
<P>
The youth-oriented cosmetics industry is responding to middle-age needs. The 
sophisticated colors, custom-blended products and anti-aging treatments that 
predominate in cosmetics collections this fall are targeted at women ages 35 to 
65. Despite glitzy makeup ads that feature 20-year-old models, the message at 
the beauty counter is that it's hip to be pushing 40, 50 or even 60something. 
Young, wrinkle-free models are made up to look older or, at least, ageless in 
the hope that mature faces will attract mature consumers. Revlon, for instance, 
recently announced the return of Lauren Hutton, now 45, to promote one of its 
lines. And at 37, Isabella Rossellini, continues to be the Lancome "face," a 
job she's had for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence that cosmetics companies are promoting neutral colors with 
no-shine finishes as this season's most fashionable look. A matte finish 
reflects less light, thus de-emphasizing wrinkles and age lines. "The woman who 
is over 35 today has always been exposed to subtle makeup. She feels that she 
looks her best wearing neutrals," says Andrea Quinn Robinson, president of 
Ultima II and former beauty editor of Vogue. "And nothing looks worse than 
frosted makeup on a heavily creased lid," adds Robinson, who at 46 wears 
earth-tone makeup and her dark blond hair long and straight. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetics industry executives have been forced to readjust their image of the 
middle-age consumer. "A 45- or 50-year-old woman doesn't think old, dress old 
or act old and, obviously, with that kind of an attitude, she doesn't look 
old," says Tony Michaels, vice president of marketing and advertising at 
Lancome. "Mothers are looking at what their teen-agers are doing with bright 
colors and doing the same with neutrals. They're not wearing less makeup; 
they're wearing it differently -- more eyeliner, more eye shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than dictating colors this year, manufacturers are selling what 
customers say they want. On the eyes, women will be wearing no-shine versions 
of the earth tones so popular in the 1960s and early '70s. Deep shades on the 
lips, rather than the pale hues of 15 or 20 years ago, will update the face for 
the '90s. But red, and even orange, lipsticks are subdued with brown tones. The 
latest foundations will be as close to natural as possible, with delicate peach 
blushers adding just a hint of color on the cheeks. Custom-blended powders and 
foundations, such as those by Charles of the Ritz, Prescriptives, Luminique and 
Visage Beaute, have a tremendous following among women over 35. 
</P>
<P>
Catering to an older consumer, often a working woman, has forced the cosmetics 
industry to give her more than just the makeup colors she wants, says Vivian 
Behrens, vice president of marketing for Estee Lauder cosmetics. "Her time is 
at a premium, so the woman who's over 40 wants products that marry treatment 
and color." 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead of Lear's, Mirabella and other magazines geared to the older 
reader, the cosmetics industry recognizes that while she's willing to look her 
age, the older woman is determined to look her best. Price, it seems, is no 
object. Many anti-aging products, such as La Prairie's Essence of Skin Caviar 
and Chanel's Emulsion No. 1, cost more than $70. Before the anti-aging trend 
hit the cosmetics market three years ago, only the most exclusive skin-care 
products were priced at more than $35. Arie Kopelman, president and chief 
operating officer of Chanel Inc., says that the older woman is willing to pay 
these high prices only for products that make a visible difference because 
"she's been around. She's not stupid. If a woman is going to pay $40, $50 or 
$60 for a face cream, it has to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
At Clinique, which is known for its moderate prices and youthful clientele, new 
products are infrequent, but this month the firm introduced Daily Eye Benefits, 
an eye cream that costs more than $20. Such a release is a sign that the 
industry is preparing for the maturing market. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Age Wave," which explores the societal ramifications of aging, 
author Ken Dychtwald writes that the cosmetics industry will "experience the 
biggest boom in history" as Americans spend the next several years "trying to 
take their youth with them into old age." That may be true. But 50-year-old 
Claire Kendall says her goal is much less lofty, and she may have already 
achieved it: "I don't want to look 20 or even 30 again. I just want to look the 
best I can now."

KIM YUMIKO NAGATANI

<P>
At 5 feet, 3 inches, Kim Yumiko Nagatani has been one of Southern California's 
busiest petite models. Now at 38, an age when she had expected to be working 
less, she's in demand because of her mature appearance. Keeping her over-35 
face looking vital means treating dry skin. "I was a beach bunny all my life, 
and now I'm paying for it," the Torrance native laments. So she uses sun block 
and moisturizer to prevent further damage and applies eye cream for 
crow's-feet. In her busy life as a wife and mother of daughters Alyssa, 3, and 
Ayama, 6, Nagatani already wears the new neutrals. "I've worn brown, black and 
charcoal eye shadows since I was a teen-ager," she says.

Claire Kendall of La Canada was in her early 20s when her ash-brown hair turned 
gray. Horrified, she tinted it until she was 43, when upkeep became too 
time-consuming. "I tried to blend the colors with temporary rinses while it was 
growing out, but most of the time I wore scarves and kept my hair super short. 
It was awful," Kendall recalls. Today, at 50, she is one of the West's top 
mature models, sought after for her silver hair. The mother of four sons, 
including race car driver Tommy Kendall, she has her own racing license but 
prefers taking to the ski slopes for her fun. So Kendall spends nine months out 
of the year in Sun Valley, Ida. Exposure to the elements there means her fair 
skin "takes a beating," she says. "I have to protect it with sunscreen all the 
time." Although many of her friends have been turning to cosmetic surgery, 
Kendall says it's not an alternative for her: "Not yet -- I'm basically 
chicken."

MARGARET HOLLAND SARGENT 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Margaret Holland Sargent of Los Angeles is a grandmother, a model and a 
successful portrait artist. Modeling was just a sideline for her in the past, 
Sargent says, but she's working in more television commercials now that she's 
older. Despite the increased on-camera attention, her art still comes first. 
Currently at work on a portrait of her granddaughter, Erin Paige Sargent, the 
artist says most of her paintings are commissioned for private collections and 
others are created for news magazines. Among her most famous subjects are 
Gerald Ford, Margaret Thatcher, Tennessee Williams and Alexander Haig. Studying 
other people's faces has given her insight into her own. "Makeup is just a 
means of creating light and shadows on the face -- I always keep that in mind," 
says Sargent, who acknowledges that even she occasionally falls into a makeup 
rut. When that happens, she consults professional makeup artists during 
modeling assignments for advice on updating colors and application techniques. 
She used a brown tint on her hair until five years ago, when she finally 
decided to let the gray show "because it's kinder to my face." With lighter 
hair to frame her face, she now selects a paler foundation and subtler shades 
of eye shadow than she wore when she was younger. Sargent changes her makeup 
palette seasonally, favoring rosy pinks in the spring and earth tones in the 
fall. "Now that there's a market for grandmother models," she says, "I'm paying 
more attention to makeup."

'ACTION CUTS' THAT RESIST TOUSLING AND JOSTLING ARE THE NEW STYLES FOR KIDS

AT 6 MONTHS OLD, England's wee Princess Beatrice, daughter of the Duke and 
Duchess of York, may be a bit too young to influence hair fashions, but her 
dapper little cousins, Prince William and Prince Harry, are already 
trend-setters. Their very traditional cuts have replaced last year's spiky-tyke 
styles as the look for kids in 1989. Instead of trying to look like wild-haired 
rock stars, many boys ages 4 to 12 are now getting cuts that are long in back, 
tapered only slightly at the nape and fairly long on top. The look is designed 
to keep the hair neat even when tousled. These "action cuts," as hairdresser 
Edward Jimenez calls them, fall right into place no matter how many tricks the 
kids do on their bikes. "It's not a military school look," says Jimenez, whose 
Sunset Boulevard salon caters to adults and children. "The length in back keeps 
it from looking too severe." 
</P>
<P>
For girls, action-worthy styles, such as English bowl cuts and classic 
ponytails, pigtails and French braids, are all the rage. As Sherman Oaks 
children's stylist Pam Pepper explains: "Kids still don't want to look 
different from other kids -- no matter what their parents think. But the kids 
all say they want to look cool at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Easy care is a high priority for the elementary school set. "Low- to 
no-maintenance" is how Tina Cassaday, a Beverly Hills children's hairdresser, 
describes the trend. Cassaday not only makes house calls to snip the tresses of 
Michael Landon and his kids, but she also does her son Justin's entire 
second-grade class at Beverly Vista school. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's 4-year-old daughter, Jennifer, "always worries that her bangs are too 
long," Cassaday says. Jennifer isn't alone. Most children dislike it when their 
hair gets in their eyes. "Bangs should never be long enough to be blinding," 
Jimenez says. "That's the No. 1 complaint from kids. Their mothers think long 
fringe is cute, but it drives the kids crazy." This year's favorite fringe is 
eyebrow-length in front, tapering longer at the temples,similar to the way that 
child actress Sarah Doroff wore her bangs in "Three Fugitives." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, kids were asking for vibrant colors in their hair, but those 
requests have dwindled. Now the only call for color is from young actors and 
actresses who need highlights or a change of shade for a role. At her salon, 
Peppermints, Pepper says she prefers not to apply chemical treatments, such as 
hair color or perms, to children under 10. "The hair hasn't developed 
completely until then, so I can't guarantee successful results. Besides, it's 
just not healthy for young hair." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez adds that he has observed children as young as 5 years old with 
artificial highlights. "That's not the child's desire. That's the parent 
fulfilling some need," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Chemicals destroy the outer layers of the hair, making it weak and brittle, 
Cassaday says. If color is required, she chooses vegetable-based dyes that 
won't damage the hair shaft. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good that the young heirs to the British throne have not realized 
their impact on today's trends, but, as Cassaday says, "there just aren't that 
many children today who influence styles."

soccer. They need a haircut that can handle the action." Catanzaro / Mahdessian

LOOKS: DOWN WITH BUILDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SHAMPOO-SOLUBLE GELS AND SPRAYS MEAN THAT HAIR NO LONGER HAS TO TAKE A 
SHELLACKING 
</P>

THIS SPRING, teased-hair styles are making a comeback. Reminiscent of former 
First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffants, they are neat and sophisticated. But 
unlike the '60s, a vast assortment of styling products now makes the voluminous 
look possible without the torture of sleeping on wire-mesh rollers or 
back-combing hair into knots. 
</P>
<P>
As convenient, however, as gels, mousses and sprays are in producing desired 
fullness and control, these easy-to-use fixatives also can result in a bad case 
of buildup -- that stubborn residue of waxes, oils and plastics that make hair 
dull, limp, brittle and resistant to dyes and perm solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding buildup is a challenge, considering that as many as three styling 
products may be necessary to create a hair style. Take, for example, the 
technique of Phillip Wilson, the international artistic director of L'Anza, a 
hair-care-products firm in Irwindale. Wilson first applies a styling product to 
wet hair, then blows it dry, coaxing it under at the ends. Next, he gently 
teases the back for fullness, leaves the sides and top smooth and adds a gel 
for control and extra shine. He finishes with a spray. "Unless you're using 
products that don't build up or you're removing the buildup, your hair will 
eventually droop and lose its natural sheen," Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
The term buildup was first used in the mid-1970s when balsam additives were all 
the rage. Although balsam initially gave hair a soft and silky look and feel, 
the ingredient formed an unwanted coating on the hair that shampoos couldn't 
dissolve and rinsing couldn't remove. In the days of long and full Farrah 
Fawcett manes, droopy hair was an easy-to-spot aesthetic problem. When women 
recognized that the balsam products were weighing down their hair, they 
switched to other products. 
</P>
<P>
Now that daily shampooing, followed by the application of gels and mousses, is 
a common grooming ritual, buildup is much more difficult to detect. These days, 
products that can cause buildup keep the hair artificially shiny and full; 
thus, dullness and limpness are no longer telltale clues. The only obvious 
signs are extensive breakage, perms that don't take properly, and dyes that 
fade too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a solution. New shampoos that remove buildup are being formulated. 
Neutrogena Shampoo and Dep's Everyday Shampoo dissolve most accumulations of 
waxes and oils. Other deposits, such as those that result from fixatives 
containing plastics and from heavily chlorinated water, are stubborn and demand 
special treatment. Mastey's Le Remouver, Joico's Phine and L'Anza's Pree, all 
products sold in hair salons, are antidotes to buildup that must be massaged 
into the hair before it is shampooed. Once these treatments break down the 
chemical bonds that hold the particles onto the hair shaft -- a process that 
takes from one to five minutes -- the shampoo washes them away. Redken's Hair 
Cleansing Creme is a one-step product that is used like shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
Once buildup is removed, the trick is to keep it from coming back. The labels 
on gels, sprays and mousses usually state which products are shampoo-soluble 
and are thus less likely to result in buildup. Still, how to go about shopping 
based on labels alone has become a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking for specific ingredients or the absence of specific ingredients is 
useless," says Sharon Hayashi, president of Hayashi For Hair in Valencia. 
"There's no one additive that causes buildup -- it's the combination of 
ingredients." 
</P>
<P>
But Joico president Steve Stefano places the blame on the cheap synthetic 
polymers, or waxy plastics, that, he says, many manufacturers include in their 
shampoos, conditioners and fixatives. "It's expensive to develop a spray with 
just a minimum of polymers -- too expensive for mass-market products," he says. 
"Once those plastics harden, the hair breaks easily." 
</P>
<P>
For people who don't shampoo on a daily basis, other new styling products -- 
such as Hayashi's Gelplus Fixative or Joico's I.C.E. Mist -- need be applied 
only once between washings. They can be reactivated by spritzing the hair with 
water, thus ending the product-on-top-of-product cycle. 
</P>
<P>
The message is, then, that with a little effort, buildup -- once remedied only 
by harsh solvents in salons -- now can be dissolved, or even prevented, at 
home.

   Hair Is Big in Dallas,

   Isn't Teasing About Plans
   To Change the Local Do

   DALLAS -- When Roger Thompson opened a hair salon in a
North Dallas shopping mall last August, women here had great
expectations. Mr. Thompson, of New York, is world famous in
hair circles. He was artistic director for Vidal Sassoon. And
he's big in hair.
   Hair is big in these parts, very big. But Mr. Thompson
doesn't think that's any reason for the women of Big D to
hold their heads high. He thinks their heads are too high
already -- with hills of hair, bleached, lacquered and stiff
as a board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's definitely not his style. He prefers a more natural
look -- short, straight and done without gels, sprays and
teasing combs. He had plans to sell the beautiful women of
Dallas on it. He refused to do "big hair," even though, he
says "you see so much of it walking around here."
   Mr. Thompson couldn't have caused more of a stink had he
called the men at the Alamo sissies. In the months since his
arrival last summer, he has found it hard to find stylists
willing to work for him, let alone customers willing to
forsake big hair for the Thompson look. And, he says, he has
become a pariah socially among the hairdressers of Dallas.
   Nevertheless, he promises to stick it out until the Dallas
do is done for. Mr. Thompson's daughter, Sara, his partner in
crime, says "the Dallas do will go out of style before we
lower our standards." She runs the new salon for her
49-year-old father.
   In Texas, those are fighting words. Julia Sweeney, a local
public-relations executive and former society columnist for
the Dallas Times Herald, rejoins: "Dallas women will never be
separated from big, blond hair."
   Linda Ivy, a well-dressed socialite whose hair is big and
sometimes blond (except when it is red), considers big hair
an identifying characteristic of a Dallas lady, and a good
thing, too. "Wherever I go, people seem to know I'm from
Dallas," she says.
   Ms. Thompson, who wears her own red hair short, puts a
different spin on the phenomenon: Dallas men like big, blond
hair on their women, and "Dallas women are so dependent on
their men."
   And so the battle rages -- New York arrogance vs. Lone
Star intransigence. Local hairdressers, stung by the Thompson
salon's criticism of their work, have fought back by calling
Thompson stylists "twits" and "snobs," and by snubbing them
in hairdresser hangouts such as the Inwood Lounge. When
Thompson hair colorist Miguel Fernandez goes out on the town,
he says, "I say I'm a construction worker." Says Michael
Lederer, who operates the Lasting Impressions salon in North
Dallas: "This is a pretty cliquish town for hairdressers, and
the Thompson salon has offended it."
   The popularity in Dallas of big, blond hair has been
attributed to the sunny local climate, to a historical
paucity of dark-haired European immigrant groups in Dallas,
and to a peculiar reluctance among women here to renounce
their youth, when big, blond hair was "de rigueur." But
Dallas pediatrician Caryn Halpern, a big-haired blonde, says
it's simpler than that. "I like a lot of hair," she says,
"because it's sexy and it feels good."
   Hair-color makers such as L'Oreal say Dallas is one of the
biggest markets anywhere for bleach. And Glemby's, which
operates salons across the nation, sells twice as much blond
coloring in Texas as elsewhere. "Blond is the Dallas color,"
says Debbie Blackstone, who runs a local Glemby's.
   Indeed, the hair of many Texas leaders, all the way up to
Ann Richards, the new governor and a Democrat, towers over
John Tower. And it gives women's heads all the immobility of
an office tower. In an interview with the Dallas Morning
News, gubernatorial hairdresser Gail Huitt disclosed the
secret to Ms. Richards's relentlessly upstanding hair: "I rat
the tar out of it. I spray the hell out of it. We get it up
there. We defy gravity."
   Women here defiantly defend the Dallas do against Yankee
interlopers. "New Yorkers have such an attitude," sniffs
Christie Cunningham, a Dallas blonde without big hair, who is
in the clothing business. She and others ask why the Thompson
salon ever bothered coming to Dallas if the styles here are
so "backward."
   Thompson stylists respond that they made the trip at the
behest of Barneys New York, the department store that is home
to Mr. Thompson's Manhattan salon. If Barneys didn't have an
exclusive arrangement with the Thompson salon, "we would
never have come to Dallas," says Ms. Thompson, saying she
would have preferred "a more sophisticated" city like
Chicago.
   With that attitude, critics say, the Thompson salon could
go the way of a Vidal Sassoon shop that opened and closed in
Dallas in the mid-1970s. "They had that same superior
attitude about Dallas blondes, right up until they packed
their bags and left," says Dallas hairdresser Paul Neinast.
Sassoon's public relations agency attributes the salon's
demise to "the wrong location" and says Vidal Sassoon may
return to Dallas some day.
   The Thompson beauticians have tried, a little late
perhaps, to mend fences. Ms. Thompson joined a committee of
the Cattle Baron's Ball, the biggest social event of the
year. Alas, at her first meeting, Ms. Thompson recalls, "a
lady came and yelled in my face for 10 minutes about how
there was nothing wrong with big, blond hair."
   Likewise, attempts at peace with other hairdressers have
come to naught. The Roger Thompson Salon invited its local
competitors to a holiday cocktail party, but "they didn't
come," says Mr. Thompson. On another occasion, Mr. Thompson,
spotting two competitors in a restaurant, waved a white
napkin in a playful gesture of surrender. "They just got up
and walked away," he says.
   Five months after the salon opened, Ms. Thompson says, "We
can't get any hairdressers to apply" for jobs. Which may be
just as well, because the salon isn't busy any more. It had
six stylists but has let three of them go. Mr. Thompson says
that's because they failed to meet his standards. A
hairdresser who left, Ahmed Hammourri, says the three were
let go for lack of business. Whatever the case, Mr. Thompson
and his daughter concede there are lots of blank spaces in
the appointment books. "Money is not an issue when you
believe in what you're doing," says Ms. Thompson.
   Indeed, Mr. Thompson, who was born in Britain, says he has
never hesitated to reject customers if he disapproves of
their hair styles or even their professions. He won't do
psychologists' hair, for instance. They are "crazy," he says,
and incompatible with him. "It's important for me to have
clients with whom I can establish long-term relationships."
   In the long run, he believes, he will benefit from the
controversy, and customers will come around. The difference
between him and his competitors, he feels, is the difference
between art and commerce. And Dallas women will eventually
appreciate the virtues of a stylist who won't give them --
for any amount of money -- a hairdo that looks terrible on
them. "We're already seeing women we turned away come back
and tell us we were right," he says.
   Sue Eudaly isn't one of them. Persuaded by a Thompson
stylist to try something new, she found herself staring at
brown hair she didn't like -- and a $225 bill. "It was very
depressing," says Ms. Eudaly, who left without leaving a tip.
   A few weeks later, Ms. Eudaly, the wife of a Dallas
investment banker, got another hairdresser to bring back the
blond. "The Roger Thompson Salon is very definitely New
York," she says. "But they need to understand that this is
Dallas, Texas."

SOME CALL them kinky. Some say they stink. And others just plain hate them. Yet 
80% of salon patrons won't face their mirrors without a perm. According to 
Modern Salon, a hair-care industry trade journal, permanent waves are the 
second-most-requested service after haircuts in U.S. beauty shops. Despite the 
proliferation of gels, mousses and curling tools, perms remain popular because 
of the long-lasting body, versatility and wash-and-wear convenience they 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the public's love-hate relationship with the perm, manufacturers 
and stylists are in constant pursuit of the perfect wave. Faster, odor-free or 
perfumed solutions, imaginatively designed rods and updated application 
techniques are all intended to eliminate the perm's negative connotation, while 
creating fashionable soft curls. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial wave process has come a long way since the 1920s, when women sat 
for hours with their hair attached to a curling machine. Today a client can 
have a perm in less than an hour. Redken's new Velocity 5 cuts processing time 
to five minutes, a dramatic advance over the typical 20 to 45 minutes that 
other processes require. Most perm solutions break and reconfigure the protein 
bonds in the hair shaft using thioglycolic acid, which can damage the hair 
unless conditioners are used. By contrast, Velocity 5 accelerates the 
rearrangement of protein bonds using an ingredient called Synchron E.

<P>
But speed isn't the only improvement. "The trend now is to leave the hair in 
superior condition after it's permed," says Henri Mastey, president of Mastey 
de Paris, a Valencia-based hair-care manufacturer. Conditioners are added to 
most high-quality perms to prevent burning and drying. Some, such as Zotos 
International's Bain de Terre Spa Conditioning Perm, have natural additives 
including plankton and ginseng. Other conditioning perms are promoted like 
skin-care products, touting "protective" collagen, elastin and exotic herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills stylist Edward Anthony, who administers the Ve Borne perm, says 
many clients who are sensitive to the acids and harsh salts in regular perms 
opt for this 30- to 45-minute process, which uses vegetable proteins to curl 
the hair. "Ladies who want to have a perm and color at the same time prefer 
this organic approach," Anthony says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the term permanent, how long a wave lasts depends on the type of 
solution used. Mastey's non-ammonia Volumineux Volumetric Perm and Zotos' 
Acclaim are both acid waves. According to Lynn Plant, spokesperson for Zotos, 
acid-based solutions provide softer, looser curls than do longer-lasting, 
alkaline-based solutions. 
</P>
<P>
This year American women are paying $30 to $250 for the convenience of having 
three months' worth of tumbling curls or gentle waves that they can style in 
many different ways. Recent innovations may raise the price of perms even 
higher in the 1990s. But, as Modern Salon editor Mary Atherton maintains: 
"Women are not about to give up their perms. The versatility is worth the 
price."

Kathy Willets has got to get rid of that bow in her hair.;   How in the world

<HEADLINE>  BORDELLOS, DEMURE LOOK MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Hagwood writes for the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Sun-Sentinel  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (Kathy, 33, and Jeffrey Willets, 41, are accused of 35 crimes. Police say
they ran a bordello in their Tamarac, Fla., home. While Kathy Willets serviced
clients in her bedroom, her husband hid in the closet taking notes and
videotaping customers, police say.);   A woman I know said she recently ran
into Jeffrey and Kathy Willets in an Islamorada tiki bar.;   "First of all, I
was embarrassed to be in the same kind of bar as the Willetses," my buddy
sniffed.;   Once she got over that, she noticed that Kathy Willets' look was
more relaxed than her courtroom image. My friend reported that Willets was
dancing in a yellow midriff top and tight blue jeans; her hair was pulled
partially back in a barrette. She also wore less makeup than in court, but
this revealed sun-damaged skin.;   Isn't it amazing what you can notice "in a
glance"?;   I had to ask the next question: "Were you -- a woman -- offended
or perhaps even threatened by her obvious, um . . . sexual reputation?";  
"No," my buddy answered, calmly. "I was offended by her dye job. Mega-roots.";
  Meow. Remember, she said it, not me.;   Would a woman properly dressed,
coiffed and made up have to put up with the same scrutiny?;   Would she have
to contend with the occasional taunt from balconies -- "Hey, Kathy, I'm not on
that list, am I?" or "Give me back my business card"?;   I don't think so.;  
We asked Terri Lynn, president of a media-consulting firm in Fort Lauderdale,
how Willets could improve her image. Her company has prepared guests for
"Sally Jessy Raphael," "Donahue," CNN and FNN.;   "First, I'd like to get a
look at her closet," Lynn said during a telephone interview.;   "It's kind of
crowded in there already, Terri," I answered. "What next?";   "Both Kathy and
her husband are extremely good-looking people," Lynn said, ignoring my
interruption. "They're very attractive, and the issue pertains to sex. When I
see them in public, I just know they've been told to play down her sexuality;
hence the pearls and bows in her hair. They took the cue to the extreme.";  
But demure isn't working, Lynn said. The V-neck dresses Willets favors draw
attention to her breasts. She also hinted that only certain women can wear
aquamarine with white piping and get away with it.;   Lynn said there are ways
to dress for the public, showing respect without resorting to a nun's habit --
especially when you share no other nun-like habits.;   When Willets and her
husband were scheduled to appear on "The Oprah Winfrey Show," Lynn used her
knowledge of how that program can affect you (live audience and all) and how
people react to fashion (especially when one is accused of prostitution) and
came up with the following suggestions:;   (check)  Pants: "I'd want her legs
covered up. Women will feel better about her if their husbands don't look at
her legs. (I suggest) a pair of gray or navy slacks. Maybe an Anne Klein
herringbone or a small tweed.";   (check)  Bone-colored hose: "Bone because
with those she doesn't look like she's naked underneath.";   (check)  Soft,
cowl-neck turtleneck sweater: "It's a covered look, but not too stuffy or
librarian-like. Perhaps a soft color to blend with the pants.";   (check) 
Blazer: "To cover her breasts, so there's no real suggestion of sexuality.
She's a sexy woman; it comes through anyway.";   (check)  Hair: "Her hair
would really be up to her. People have seen her so much already, anything
drastic would be seen as an obvious ploy. Maybe she could do a French braid or
something to keep the hair off the face. She could use a navy bow, which is
her trademark.";   (Experts aren't always right. Lose the bow, I say!);  
(check)  Makeup: "Her makeup needs work. She wears a lot of light blue eye
shadow. She needs more colors that have the same tones as those found in her
skin.";   "Does it make her look cheap?" I asked.;   "Yes," said Lynn, before
tactfully changing the subject. "I think the final thing is a nice strand of
pearls, which I think she already has."  </TEXT>

<P>
At Girard's College of Beauty in Santa Ana, Cathy Thomassen of Newport Beach 
settles into a salon chair and awaits the royal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a full set of acrylic nails, a French braid and an eyelash tint -- 
all for $24.75," she says as a student combs through her long, wet hair. "It 
would cost me about $50 in a salon." 
</P>
<P>
Those who like to be pampered don't have to be rich to indulge in such 
luxuries. Beauty schools offer the same services as professional salons at much 
lower prices. The catch: Customers must be willing to trust their tresses and 
faces and nails to novices, and they don't enjoy the ambience of a designer 
interior or the benefit of the state-of-the-art equipment of a trendy salon. 
</P>
<P>
Girard's interior, for instance, consists of concrete walls painted an off 
shade of mauve, a matching linoleum floor and a dozen well-worn vinyl chairs. 
</P>
<P>
It matters little to Thomassen that her surroundings are less than regal, so 
long as she leaves the place looking like a queen. 
</P>
<P>
"The ambience is not as classy, but I'm not paying for ambience," says Toni 
Rogan, a 38-year-old Mission Viejo resident who had stopped in at Lake Forest 
Beauty College in El Toro to have her brown hair trimmed. Here, customers sat 
in mismatched orange and brown vinyl chairs while students in white lab coats 
painted their toenails, rolled their hair in curlers and went at them with 
scissors and blow dryers. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate walking into a snooty salon where everyone actually looks at what 
you're wearing or what you're driving," Rogan says. 
</P>
<P>
The colleges offer every service performed in professional salons, including 
hair coloring, facials, make-overs, pedicures and eyebrow tints. Colleges 
charge about $5 for a haircut alone, and $8.50 for a cut with blow-dry. Salons 
can be expected to charge $35 or more for a cut and blow-dry. A manicure done 
by a student costs about $4, whereas one by a professional is around $12. The 
students work for college credit and for tips. 
</P>
<P>
"They can get a major overhaul for under $20," Pat Follis, supervising 
instructor at Girard's, says about the school's customers. 
</P>
<P>
Adding a labor-intensive treatment such as a permanent or color weaving to a 
cut-and-style will push the fee to about $25. Permanents and color weaving are 
among the most expensive services professional salons offer. Rogan, for 
instance, said she recently paid a professional stylist $150 for a haircut and 
color weaving. 
</P>
<P>
But because all of the work is done by students, some customers are reluctant 
to risk a more advanced procedure at a beauty college. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's something more complicated like a weave, I'll go to a regular salon," 
Thomassen says. "But if it's a simple thing like a braid, I'll do it at the 
college. The service is always good, and with the money I save, I can get it 
done three times a month instead of once." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Kandare, a 27-year-old El Toro resident, has no such qualms. On a recent 
weekday morning at Lake Forest, she was willingly subjecting her long brown 
locks to a spiral perm. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't be doing perms if they didn't know how," Kandare says. "I've 
always gone to beauty colleges. It's cheaper, and usually the students are more 
conscientious. And the instructor's right there" to guide them. 
</P>
<P>
School directors say that no one will walk out of the college with a coiffure 
resembling a green Brillo pad. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrons are never guinea pigs," Follis says. 
</P>
<P>
Before they snip a single strand of a customer's hair, Follis says, the 
students have spent hundreds of hours practicing on school dolls' heads, on 
their friends, on their relatives and on each other. 
</P>
<P>
Still, accidents do happen. Lake Forest student Diana Discenzo, 20, said that 
when she performed a color weave on her first customer, she discovered that the 
highlighting shade had bled into the surrounding hair. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of little blotches where it leaked through," Discenzo said, 
"so we put a toner in. I fixed up my mistake, and she was happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I learn by my mistakes," says Discenzo, who hopes to work as a cosmetologist 
on a cruise ship after she graduates later this month. "But the customers are 
more understanding because they came to a school." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, says George Nadeau, owner of the Lake Forest college, "patrons have to 
understand this is all student work." 
</P>
<P>
"The students have different degrees of performance, but once they're on the 
floor, they're already prepared to work on customers. And these students do 
some great work." 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't paid, so they're more apt to take their time," Follis says. "It's 
a more relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Students aren't watching the clock, she says. They don't care whether the 
customer has long hair that takes four hours to perm. 
</P>
<P>
Most beauty colleges are under a contract with a community college, Regional 
Occupational Program or adult education program. These pay the colleges out of 
state education funds to act as their cosmetology schools. 
</P>
<P>
Students who register for the Lake Forest beauty school through Saddleback 
College, for instance, pay $50 a semester to Saddleback and $300 to the beauty 
school for their supply kits. They graduate from the beauty college after four 
semesters and 1,600 hours. Then they take a state exam for a cosmetology 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Although patrons can make several appointments with a favorite student, they 
know they can't become too attached because graduation is never far away. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already seen two students graduate," says June Adsit, 68, of Laguna 
Hills, a regular at Lake Forest. "I figure: 'Good for her. She's done it.' I 
feel like I'm a granny to them all." 
</P>
<P>
The colleges have a large following among people over 50 -- especially the Lake 
Forest school, which draws heavily from nearby Leisure World in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many older patrons make their visits to the beauty college a weekly 
ritual. The low prices appeal to those on a fixed income. Others simply like 
the slower pace. They also get a chance to mingle while they have their nails 
painted and their hair washed and set. 
</P>
<P>
"I love seeing the young people," says Elizabeth Frederickson, 84, of Leisure 
World. "I come here every week." 
</P>
<P>
As a young student finishes cutting her hair, he holds her hand and gently pats 
her shoulder. She clearly likes the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband's not well," says a white-haired woman at Girard's who asks not to 
be identified. "It's good to get away and get some tender loving care. It's 
like therapy." 
</P>
<P>
For vanity's sake, some patrons don't want others to know they go to a beauty 
school. Beauty colleges still carry a stigma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my friends to know I come," says an elderly woman who would not 
give her name. She has been coming to the Lake Forest college for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd think it's terrible," she says. "But otherwise, I could only get my 
hair done once a month." 
</P>
<P>
The economics of it have prompted many people, young and old, to swallow their 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to two colleges, and both are getting busier," Thomassen says. "More 
people are catching on." 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  'EVEN when the economy's fine, people are being fired and laid off," Phyllis
Macklin says. "There's much more of it now, and there's increased competition
for the jobs that are available, so you want to make sure that in every way
you have the edge.";    For Macklin's clients -- she's a partner in an
executive outplacement firm -- that starts with a long look in the mirror.
Some people, she says, "have advanced in their careers without ever paying
attention to how they dress." They've sailed along on pure competence, and
nobody's minded that they look like schlumps. Other people "have gotten
sloppy."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     'Picky little details';  Either way, it's a problem. Because to get a job
-- particularly the kind of high-level corporate job her clients are angling
for -- it isn't enough to be competent. You also have to look competent. So
Macklin, over the years, has become a connoisseur of the million "picky little
details" that, in U.S. corporate culture, make a person look like a success.; 
  "For instance, a man makes a better impression in a navy-blue suit,
single-breasted, with a white shirt with a spread collar and long sleeves,
cotton because cotton won't pill at the collar, laundered and ironed.";   
You've heard that much before, but Macklin's just getting started: "A
crew-neck undershirt so the line doesn't show through the shirt. Tip of the
tie comes to the top or center of the belt buckle, back of the tie should go
through the label so the ends stay together. A belt that shows no signs of
wear or weight loss or gain. Well-shined, recently heeled black tie shoes.
Lightweight navy or black over-the-calf socks. No more than one ring on each
hand, and no other jewelry -- no tie tack, no bracelet, no necklace.";   
Nails should be "cut short and filed and clean. Hair should be trimmed . . .
above the ears and faces should be cleanshaven." To clients who are "real
attached to a beard or mustache," she says, "shave it until you're hired"
because "nobody ever doesn't get an offer for being cleanshaven.";    Clothes
should be "the best they can possibly afford." Carry "a leather portfolio or
slim briefcase. Pen in pocket sufficiently to the left so it doesn't stick out
of the jacket. Button the jacket when standing.";    Why do these minutiae
matter?;    An interviewer, Macklin says, will be looking at her clients "to
see if they fit, if they know the rules, if they can represent the company,"
if they can "deal with details." Subconsciously, the interviewer also will be
looking for "cues" that "demonstrate that person has been successful in the
past." This is why an unironed shirt, down-at-the-heel shoes, or a belt that
shows you've gained 20 pounds is a serious mistake: You want to impress the
guy, not make him feel sorry for you.;    More flexibility for women;  With so
much riding on appearance, Macklin advises clients to "wear what's better;
don't take second choice." Guys will say, "Isn't a blue shirt OK?" And it is
OK, but "a white shirt has a better impact.";    Women, she says, "have a
little more flexibility," but only a little. Macklin says they should wear
navy, gray or dark maroon conservative suits, a long-sleeved, high-necked
blouse in a complementary solid color -- white or cream or a pastel, "not red
or fuchsia." The skirt should cover the knee when they're seated in the
interview.;    The point is to "project professionalism," not sexiness.
Medium-heel leather pumps, no open toes or backs, and always stockings or
pantyhose, even in the summer. Simple earrings, not dangling. A pin or a
necklace. A watch. No more than one ring per hand. No more than one bracelet.;
   Makeup simple and soft, hair should be short, professional -- "not teased,
not bouffant, not bleached." Nails should be manicured, with light or clear
polish. Carry a briefcase, not a purse, and not both, because it's
"cumbersome," and "looks ungainly." If you wear a scarf or a necklace, make it
short enough to focus attention on your face.;    She reminds clients -- both
men and women -- to wear "glasses with up-to-date frames, and no tinting, no
photo-grays" because "you sit with someone and there's this barrier; they feel
like you're hiding." And when she says "up-to-date," she doesn't mean the
latest thing, necessarily. She's thinking of the guy who's been having new
lenses put in the same pair of beat-up Buddy Holly frames for the past 20
years because they haven't actually fallen apart yet. So he looks like a nerd,
a cheapskate or both.;    Macklin even tells clients when they have bad
breath, or body odor, or dandruff -- because if she doesn't, who will? "It's
very difficult to tell someone you work with that they have bad breath or
dandruff -- or that their perfume is too strong.";    Speaking of which, she
says you shouldn't wear any to an interview -- no perfume, no cologne, no
after-shave, no strong-smelling deodorant -- because what smells lovely to you
might smell awful to the interviewer.;    Make sure you get to the interview a
few minutes early so you have time to "wash your hands first, check yourself
out in the mirror, brush off your shoulders, comb your hair, make sure your
zippers are zipped and your buttons are buttoned.";    Then walk in, smile,
greet the interviewer by name, shake hands firmly and focus on the interview.;
   Once you've got the job, do a good job at it, and nobody'll mind if you
grow your mustache, wear blue shirts, come to work soaked in Giorgio, or have
bad breath. Well, maybe they'll mind. But they won't tell you.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bosom-baring models at Yves Saint Laurent and
the very proper late Duchess of Windsor had one thing in common _
perfectly coiffed tresses cared for by Alexandre de Paris.
   His hairstyles add zing to styles shown at nearly every major
fashion show in town _ from Saint Laurent to Chanel and from
Jean-Louis Scherrer to Emanuel Ungaro.
   During the shows, Alexandre and 20 assistants turn out
everything from ``snail'' chignons to lion locks on hundreds of
models.
   ``I have to know what's going on in the designers' minds,'' said
Alexandre during an interview in his office above the salon on the
Champs Elysees. ``I can't just play the matador with hair. It has
to be a logical part of fashion.''
   Known as king of coiffeurs, Alexandre also performs at royal
marriages such as Princess Caroline's first big wedding in Monaco.
He is on constant call for friends like Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia
Loren.
   He admires Loren ``who actually does her own hair almost every
day.''
   Born Louis Alexandre Raimondi to a family of vintners in the
Riviera seaport of St. Tropez, Alexandre started cutting hair in
1938 when he was 15, working for Antoine, the Cannes hairdresser
who was known as Coco Chanel's favorite.
   Alexandre was encouraged by the bushy-haired writer Colette, a
neighbor and friend of his grandmother ``who talked about Paris all
the time. I knew I had to go there.''
   After World War II, he met the Begum and the Duchess of Windsor,
who insisted he come to Paris, and he transferred his salon.
   Alexandre kept Jean Cocteau's wavy gray locks in line. The
artist-writer-film creator called Alexandre the sphinx, which
became the hair stylist's logo.
   When he met the Carita sisters the trio decided to set up shop
in 1952 on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, not far from the
presidential Elysees Palace.
   Five years later, he branched off and hired a staff of 150,
becoming ``Alexandre de Paris.'' In 1980, he moved to the present
salon.
   With outlets throughout the United States and his own salon in
Houston, Alexandre's turnover is about $7 million a year _ much of
it from his accessory and cosmetics business.
   In November, he opened a small luxury accessory shop on the rue
du Faubourg Saint Honore with Francois Lesage, the master
embroiderer of haute couture.
   The whirlwind of fashion shows, royal weddings and openings are
all taken in stride, but some events are more memorable _ such as a
wedding in 1951 in Venice where he made a real splash.
   ``I'd done Princess Ira von Furstenburg's hair for her wedding
and was walking the gangplank from the gondola to attend the
ceremony.'' he recalled. ``Suddenly, I tripped and fell in the
Venice canal like a piece of lead.''
   Alexandre spends much of his free time with his two children
(neither in the hair business) and five grandchildren, often
spending holidays with them at his villa in St. Tropez.
   But his obsession remains with tresses, and he loves to give
advice: ``Long hair is for young girls or women who can afford to
have their hair done every day.'' he said. ``Most women should wear
something more modern, easier to care for.''
   As for older women letting their hair go gray, Alexandre doesn't
think much of it ``unless the woman has a lovely silvery sheen or a
snowy white color, as my grandmother did.''
   Though Alexandre is coiffeur to the stars, he also finds time
for ordinary customers ``provided they reserve well in advance.''
   A cut and restyling at the salon costs $35 dollars, inexpensive
by Paris standards. The price for styling by the master himself is
higher and is set according to the client.
   ``I've done the job so well on a few that their own husbands
didn't recognize them,'' he said.

<LEADPARA>  Dog owners know their pets produce three things in abundance.;   Two are love
and fur. Only one can be spun.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I think dog hair is one of the finest wools you can find," said Shirley
Boniface, who owns a champion blue merle sheltie. "I love the feel of it.";  
Boniface said grooming her champion, Sterling, and three other shelties
yielded mounds of silvery gray, black and white fur that she routinely threw
away.;   But as a knitter in a state where it's cold seven months a year,
Boniface thought the fur should be used. She started saving. After about 18
months there was enough hair to turn over to a local spinner.;   "I wanted to
be able to say, 'Well, here is my champion and he gave me this hat,' "
Boniface said.;   Clothing made of dog hair is catching on in Alaska, spinners
say.;   "There may be a higher level of interest because people are more
dog-crazy up here," said Diane Olthuis, who spins dog-hair and musk-ox yarn at
her small textile business in Hope, about 25 miles south of Anchorage.;  
Olthuis said she supplies some dog-fur skeins to a store in Colorado, where
mushing is becoming popular, but most of her customers are Alaskans.;   People
who turn dog fur into mittens, sweaters and floppy berets like the fur because
it's durable, warm, plentiful, cheap and versatile.;   "There's nothing you
can't do with it. I have a friend who used fur from a couple of dogs and did a
really big coverlet in different colors of gray," said Sue Bannister, an
Anchorage spinner.;   Spinning dog hair is not a task for novices and the work
isn't cheap. It costs about $10 to have an ounce of yarn spun. That's about
enough to make half a ski cap.;   Since dog hair lacks the natural lanolin of
sheep fleece and has no crimp, it's harder to work into a strand. Spinners tug
out little tufts at a time, and sheep's wool sometimes is blended with the
fur.;   Not all breeds are suitable. Fur from the short-haired husky is
difficult, and crinkly poodle hair is worse. A top choice is the long white
underfur of the Samoyed.;   Many Alaskans still turn up their noses at
dog-hair yarn, said Kay Hathhorne, who owns an Anchorage weaving studio. "They
say, 'Oh, gross, doesn't it smell?' " she said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  WHY ARE PEOPLE WITH ORANGE hair called redheads?;    NATURALLY WE TURNED TO
THE COLOR Association of the United States for help. This is a real
organization. They give advice to the fashion industry. Associate director
Margaret Walch confirmed our suspicions: Redheads are actually orangeheads.
"The hue is orange, but we call it red," Walch said.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  West  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THAT'S WHY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The Standard Color Reference of America lists 198 individual colors. One is
"henna," which as a hair coloring is designed to make someone a redhead, but
which Walch describes as "terra cotta orange." We asked her to clarify that
and she said it was "rust colored." Unfortunately the chromatically illiterate
Why staff comprehends only red, blue, green, yellow, orange, brown and purple,
and so we insisted on a simpler description, finally getting: "It's a
brown-orange.";    So why do we call it red?;    "I think there is a
psychological connotation here. Red has positive connotations, as opposed to
orange, which has a banal, pedestrian quality," she said. "Red implies more
energy, more drama.";    Incidentally, if you've ever wondered why fashionable
people use such absurd terms for colors -- you know, "cardinal" instead of
"red" -- it's because those are the official colors according to the Standard
Color Reference of America. There is no red in there. But there is "scarlet"
and "geranium." There's also "flax," "toast brown," "grotto blue," "amber
light," "mosstone," which is green with a touch of gray, and the bizarre
"leghorn." It's a sort of phlegm yellow. To use an unofficial term.;  GUESS
AGAIN; DIANA RIGG WOULD PROBABLY RATHER not be reminded of her 1973 NBC
sitcom. What was it called?;    A. Diana;    B. The Girl With Something Extra;
   C. Lotsa Luck;    D. Needles and Pins;    E. Roll Out (Answer below);

forget B, on which they appeared.  </TEXT>

ERMA BOMBECK: AT THE ROOT OF A HAIRY STEREOTYPE

<TEXT>
<P>
The three morning television shows have focused on an old question: "Do blondes 
have more fun and bigger ratings than brunettes?" 
</P>
<P>
For as long as I can remember, dark-haired women have been treated as an 
acquired taste -- like anchovies. They're the villains in novels, the 
stepmothers in fairy tales and the witches in films. They're represented by the 
Leona Helmsleys, the Alexises and the girls who never get the guys. 
</P>
<P>
If Jane Pauley had been blond, she never would have grown older. If Kathleen 
Sullivan had been blond, she never would have been replaced. If Zsa Zsa Gabor 
had been a brunette, she'd be making license plates in a penal institution 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what it is about light hair that seems to bring forth an image of 
goodness, innocence and vulnerability, but it has always been so, ever since 
golden-curly-headed, sweet, orphaned Shirley Temple triumphed over 
mean-spirited, spoiled, brattish Jane Withers. 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder if Harry would have loved Sally if she'd had dark hair. 
Would Jane Russell have been the legend if she had gotten the bleach and 
Marilyn Monroe the dye? Would the world be rooting for Ivana if she had black 
hair? 
</P>
<P>
Some stars saw the handwriting on the contracts and changed the course of their 
careers by lightening up. I used to see Linda Evans on "The Rockford Files" as 
a brunette, but her career didn't really take off until she became blond 
Krystle on "Dynasty." Loni Anderson went unnoticed as a brunette; it wasn't 
until she emerged as a sexy blonde on "WKRP in Cincinnati" that she became a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that blondes still carry a stigma of their own -- that of being 
"dumb." 
</P>
<P>
How many blondes do you see in the U.S. Senate? Can you actually see Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with platinum hair being treated with any 
credibility? Or Sen. Nancy Kassebaum or Elizabeth Dole being spoken to in words 
of more than three syllables if they were blondes? Forget the polls; I could 
have told Geraldine Ferraro that people don't vote for blondes for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
I say you can't tell what's inside the package by the wrapping or the size of 
the box. Meryl Streep is blond and she's smart. Elizabeth Taylor is sexy and 
she's a brunette. 
</P>
<P>
We've been told too long that women are worth an expensive hair coloring. Maybe 
we should be rewarded for what we contribute to this world. That's what we're 
really worth. 
</P>
<P>
If I sound passionate about this, it's because I just had my roots dyed . . . 
sable brown.

HAIR, MAKEUP AND FRAGRANCES ECHO FASHION'S NEW LIGHTENED-UP LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN FASHION DESIGNERS show chiffon and lace for daytime, as they did at spring 
previews, the result is a season of softness -- flowing lines rather than 
geometric shapes, subdued rather than garish colors. With this message of 
softness emanating from the fashion capitals -- Milan, Paris, New York and 
Tokyo -- beauty decision makers are responding in kind: Spring makeup, hair and 
even fragrances are softer, gentler and less restricted than at any time since 
the '60s, when flower children introduced the no-makeup look. 
</P>
<P>
But the new soft look doesn't mean no makeup. Paradoxically, to achieve a 
softer look, women may find themselves wearing more makeup than ever before. 
What they wear, however, will be applied with a light hand and with precise 
attention to detail. The ultimate goal is to look refined -- emphatically not 
bare-faced or unfinished, which was fashionable in the '60s and early 1970s. 
The pale lips, fragile eyelids and unexaggerated cheekbones that are the 
signatures of spring are carefully highlighted with new, more delicate shades. 
</P>
<P>
The season's beauty focus is on individuality, concentrating on facial features 
rather than on makeup or hair styles. Idiosyncratic characteristics are 
amplified rather than masked to allow an individual's inherent beauty to come 
through. Women who have "quirky" features -- freckles, full lips, thin lips -- 
will not try to disguise them. Tyen, artistic director for Christian Dior 
cosmetics, says: "There is no contouring. No spots of color. When I look at a 
woman this spring, I don't remember her color. I only remember her beauty." 
</P>
<P>
SUBDUED HUES COLOR THE NEW FACE 
</P>
<P>
FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, aggressively red lipsticks have been fashionable. This 
season, however, lipsticks in shades of almond, golden pink, dusty rose, even 
brownish-red, border on pale; yet these should never be lighter than natural 
lip tones. And after years of glossy lipsticks, matte finishes are in fashion. 
These "allow you to see natural texture and contours without the distortion 
caused by shiny, creamy lipsticks," says makeup artist Marilyn Young of the Ole 
Henriksen salon in Los Angeles. In the past, although women rejected drying, 
matte-finish lipsticks, manufacturers found that adding moisturizing emollients 
to a matte-finish product was virtually impossible. Now, however, blending 
technology has been improved, permitting the introduction of new, oil-rich 
matte lipsticks. 
</P>
<P>
When the lips are muted, eyes get the attention. This spring, eyelids may be 
shaded with as many as five different powders -- sand, rose, honey, peach, 
sable, for example -- but such amalgams are blended to produce a hint of gentle 
color. Surprisingly, the season of softness allows for a variation that 
strongly emphasizes eyes with liner. Shiseido's Parisian artistic director, 
Serge Lutens, for example, is showing an obvious, dark liner on upper and lower 
lids with shadows that appear to lighten the lids slightly. Most American 
makeup artists, however, are featuring the look without liner, placing emphasis 
on lashes and brows. The eyebrows are left natural, yet tamed with new brow 
gels. Before mascara, lashes are softly curled; a new device called Lady Wink 
can be used as a cold or hot curler for long-lasting curve. 
</P>
<P>
TOUCHABLE HAIR AT ANY LENGTH 
</P>
<P>
THE NATURAL FREEDOM of very short or very long hair is an integral element of 
the soft spring look. Just as designers of beauty products are operating on the 
theory that a woman's makeup should not be noticeable, many hairdressers are 
likewise saying that the healthy glow of the hair -- rather than the style -- 
is what's fashionable. Geometrically structured haircuts -- such as the sharply 
chiseled bob -- have become passe. And now more than ever, black and Asian 
women will not alter their natural hair with gels and texturizers to conform to 
a largely Caucasian ideal. The point of the natural look in hair is to call 
attention to the eyes, an effect achieved by dense bangs, which skim the 
eyebrows, as well as hair brushed back and off the face. Long hair -- straight, 
waved or curly -- can be worn free-flowing. Or the hair can be pulled back into 
a chignon or ponytail to completely free the face of clutter. 
</P>
<P>
"Short" this spring means hair cut no longer than earlobe length. If the style 
is a blunt page boy, hair should just graze the earlobes. Even newer is hair 
cropped to within an inch of its roots. This is "no-conflict" hair -- tresses 
snipped into shape, then left to their own devices, framing the face rather 
than being noticed on their own. Sterfon Demings, educational director of the 
John Atchison salons in New York and Los Angeles, says that one of the most 
important aspects of the short style that he created, at left, is that it is a 
"low- to no-maintenance look. Women have better things to do with their time 
than worry about their hair." 
</P>
<P>
NEW TREATMENTS FOR 'NATURAL' SKIN 
</P>
<P>
UNDER THIS SEASON'Ssheer makeup foundations and delicate, iridescent powders, 
the natural textures and tones of the skin are not hidden. Therefore, the 
newest treatment products are designed to make skin look very refined and 
flawless. But since consumers spend $3 billion annually on skin-care products, 
the Food and Drug Administration is constantly reminding the cosmetics industry 
that product promises of wrinkle-free, blemish-free skin won't be tolerated. In 
response, in April, Ultima II will release The Moisturizer, an emollient cream 
for which the only claim made is that it will be regularly reformulated to keep 
up with changing technology. Consumers are left to draw their own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of other moisturizing formulas will be released this season. The 
impetus has come from the fact that the 30- to 40-plus crowd -- who now spend 
the most money on cosmetics -- are developing wrinkles. (Fine lines can be 
attributed to surface dryness, but deeper wrinkles are typically caused by 
aging and can't be helped by moisturizers.) While most exfoliating products 
tend to dry the skin while helping to refine the surface texture, Dior's new 
Exfoliant Rose, a gel with grains encapsulated in oils, is intended to 
lubricate as it exfoliates. Lancome's Hydra-Bleu Cool Hydrating Masque and 
Princess Marcella Borghese's Cura Natura -- which looks like green caviar -- 
are other new products purported to restore moisture to the surface of the 
skin. For oily skin, Max Factor offers the clay-based Incredible Blue Mask, 
which changes color as excess oils are absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
SPRING SIGNALS A NEW, LIGHTER APPROACH TO FRAGRANCE 
</P>
<P>
VIRTUALLY EVERY scent introduced for spring emphasizes subtlety. Advertisements 
for Red, the new fragrance from the makers of heady Giorgio, declare that 
"nothing so soft was ever so exciting." Christian Dior, which introduced 
powerful Poison perfume two years ago, now produces Soft Poison, a "light 
cologne" version of the very successful original. Fred Hayman's 273, developed 
by the former owner of Giorgio, is much more understated than his potent debut 
fragrance. And Listen, the first fragrance put out by music-industry mogul Herb 
Alpert, blends delicate notes of muguet with lemon and bergamot. Following a 
successful test run in Southern California that began in October, the scent, 
which a Listen representative describes as "whisper soft," will be launched 
nationally in spring. 
</P>
<P>
Even the House of Guerlain, which is probably best known for its intensely 
sensual scent, Shalimar, is launching a new soft perfume in Paris in June. The 
name, as yet undisclosed, will reflect the newly rediscovered virtues of 
low-key essences. 
</P>
<P>
Just as there is a trend toward subtle lip and eye color that recalls elements 
of the natural look in '60s makeup, there is a renaissance of lighter 
fragrances with obviously natural notes -- lily, lemon and herbal aromas, among 
them -- that also were popular in that decade. The big difference now is that 
the new soft scents are among the most costly perfumes, and major companies are 
marketing them to an upscale audience. In contrast, many of the lighter scents 
of the '60s and early '70s were inexpensive fad items, aimed predominantly at 
the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
When New York City's Bloomingdale's begins its tribute to California fashion 
designers and beauty products in April, it will introduce a new Max Factor 
fragrance, Jaclyn Smith's California, an ultra-soft scent that joins the 
celebrity-signature fragrance category. The Smith fragrance will be available 
to the rest of the country -- including California -- in July. Before the 
scent's development, consumers surveyed by Factor reported that they were tired 
of heavy fragrances and wanted a "soft and light scent." Further, they 
described the former "Charlie's Angels" star as "soft and feminine," according 
to Sharon LeVan, Max Factor's senior vice president of marketing. Thus consumer 
opinion directly influenced the softness trend. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains, however: Will women respond at the cash register to 
beauty's new soft wares? Will sales of red lipsticks and aggressive fragrances 
fall as consumer taste shifts to pale shades and mellow smells? Retailers are 
optimistic. Gary Cockrell, cosmetics buyer for both I. Magnin and Bullocks 
Wilshire stores, explains that the soft approach in beauty and fragrance is a 
result of a growing self-confidence among women. "Pale cosmetics are for a 
woman who is sure of herself and who is sophisticated enough to appreciate her 
own beauty," he says. Michael Ziegler, senior vice president and general 
merchandising manager of cosmetics at Robinson's, concurs, noting that he sees 
the season's soft, natural look "as a form of enhancement, rather than an 
attempt to change the way a woman looks. Will women here go for it? Why not? 
Isn't it very much a California thing to do?"

CAREFUL STYLING CAN HELP EASE THE TRANSITION FROM SHORT HAIR TO LONG

WHEN HEMLINE fads shift from thigh to knee to ankle, the simple secret to 
looking fashionable is having three black skirts, one in each length. But when 
hair trends drop from ear-skimming crops to longer, softer styles -- which is 
precisely what's happening now -- there's no easy way to stay in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The short, little-boy cuts of last year are beginning to look tired -- "last 
decade," as fashion folk put it. And the signs of change are everywhere. 
Although some Paris models wore abbreviated cuts at the spring shows, most 
sported longer, wavier and generally more feminine styles. In the latest issues 
of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, supermodel Linda Evangelista, who started the 
latest short-sheared craze, is wearing her dark brown hair over her ears and 
longer at the crown and in back. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, women with short hair are talking about slightly longer 
haircuts, too. "Especially the trend-setters," says Blase, a hairdresser at 
Beverly Hills' Juan Juan salon. "When they see that everyone is wearing their 
look, they want something newer." 
</P>
<P>
But to go from pixie to pageboy takes time. The average head of hair grows half 
an inch per month, Blase points out, and it should be trimmed at least a 
quarter-inch every five to six weeks. "So if you start from very short right 
now, you can have a nice chin-length style by the holidays," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hairdresser Allen Edwards, who has six Southern California salons, including 
shops in Beverly Hills, Long Beach and Irvine, agrees that getting a haircut 
every four to five weeks will ease the growing-out process. "There should be a 
new look for each new length," Edwards says. "There is always a hair style that 
will suit a woman's face, no matter how long or short her hair is. She 
shouldn't have to wait for her hair to get longer to look good." 
</P>
<P>
Achieving a one-length style from a layered cut requires frequent trimming of 
the sides and back while the crown and bangs get longer. But the resulting 
blunt, geometric look is probably too sophisticated for today's casual 
fashions. "Rather than have the perimeter of the hair straight, it's newer to 
keep it uneven -- it's much more casual," says Geri Cusenza of Sebastian 
International in Woodland Hills. Cusenza, who is letting her own dark brown 
locks grow out, wears spit curls and wispy bangs but keeps the rest of her hair 
layered to look its thickest. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards also recommends a shaggier transition look with a fringe of bangs, 
calling it more feminine and less severe. Blase perms hair to achieve more 
softness around the face while the hair gets longer, but never before it's 
about four inches long at the crown. "Otherwise, the style will look too round 
on top," he cautions. 
</P>
<P>
But other stylists believe that most clients want their hair to look as long as 
possible as fast as possible. Hairobics Salon owner George Caroll of Toluca 
Lake discourages perms or the use of round styling brushes to curl hair under 
because both tend to make the hair seem shorter. Instead, he teaches clients to 
use a flexible plastic brush he has designed that straightens the hair during 
blow-drying, giving the illusion of longer hair. "But you need to trim the ends 
frequently to keep the hair looking its thickest and neatest," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For women who refuse to spend the time and money for frequent trims or a perm, 
gels and pomades help to tame the hairs that tend to stick out around the ears. 
Cusenza, whose company manufactures styling products, prefers light aerosol 
gels to mousses, which make the hair stiff. "Everything about the new, longer 
styles is light and feminine, and mousses make the styles look too heavy," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Some women deal with the vagaries of hair fashion the same way European runway 
models do: They wear wigs. New synthetic wigs and falls in short, wavy styles 
cost about $150 and provide an instant hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, times when even a wig can't satisfy the needs of the most 
impatient woman. But enduring the transition, whether it's weeks or months, 
does have its hidden benefit. It allows a woman to determine which length best 
suits her features. 
</P>

   You want to look terrific at your wedding, not just because it's
your day in the spotlight, but because the pictures made will be
among the most tangible mementos of the event.
   But just like every other detail of the celebration, getting
your hair, makeup and skin ready takes planning and care.
   ``Hair and makeup are the keys to a bride's beauty, and she
should devote as much care and attention to them as she does to the
selection of her dress,'' says Denise O'Donoghue, Bride's magazine
beauty editor.
   Along with Prell, the shampoo maker, she advises getting hair
into shape early. If you plan to color, highlight or permanent your
hair, do it well enough in advance to fine tune the result.
Preliminary shaping should be done about three or four months in
advance and a fresh cut done about three weeks before the wedding.
Freshly washed and conditioned hair will look fullest and best in
the photographs. Smooth wispy flyaway strands with hairspray, but
be sure to do so before stepping into your gown to avoid staining
or spotting on light-colored, delicate fabrics.
   Also plan your makeup, which may be different from your daily
wear. ``Remember, you will be wearing white from head to toe. Since
the only color will be on your face, your palette has to be just
right,'' says O'Donoghue.
   She recommends experimenting ahead of time, using a white sheet
to simulate the effect of the gown. This will help you discover
whether you'll look better in peach- or pink-tinted makeup. She
advises forgoing frosted or pearlized makeup items, since the
resulting iridescence reflects too much and will make your skin
photograph unnaturally.
   Choose a light foundation toned to your skin and soften blusher
and eyeshadow by blending the edges. Soft black or brown mascara
should be lightly applied, since the white of the gown will
intensify its impact. And, of course, the mascara should be
waterproof to avoid streaking from tears.
   Then, have a friend make test pictures to see how the makeup
choices do on film.
   Nails should be professionally manicured every three or four
weeks, with the last session the day before the wedding. Choose
pastel pink or peach shades consistent with your makeup.
   Part of the preparation is getting skin into shape, according to
L'Oreal Cosmetics, which recently introduced a top French skincare
collection called Plenitude. According to Linda Harris, vice
president of product development, the key to healthy skin is
cleansing and moisturizing. Bar soaps are too harsh and strip
natural oils, she says, so the job should be done with gels (for
oily skin) or creams (dry skin).

From Imaging Systems,
But Are They Just a Fad?

   Karen Blair whisks off my mustache, but she doesn't stop there. 
She cuts, then perms my hair. 
The change is so radical that I egg her on. 

   "Make me blond," I say. 

   Ms. Blair is gleeful. 
"Let's try red, instead," she suggests. 

   Before I know it, I am a bare-lipped redhead with a permanent wave -- in short, a buffoon. 
I peer at my new self and think, gee, I'm glad I never did anything this stupid. 

   I can say that because my transformation was accomplished without scissors, razors or dyes. 
Using a sophisticated $20,000 video computer, Ms. Blair digitized my face, projected the image on a monitor, replaced my hair style with a style stored in the computer's memory, smoothed out my new look with an electronic pen and then printed the whole thing on paper. 

   Looking at this preview of a possible new me, I tell Ms. Blair that I have seen the future and it is ugly. 

   Ms. Blair, an independent consultant who works out of the Personal Touch beauty salon here, isn't discouraged. 
"I tell all my customers it's as important to know what doesn't work as it is to know what looks nice," she says. 

   Having made people quicker, smarter and richer, computers are now being used to make them better-looking as well. 
Ms. Blair, who charges $25 for a 45-minute imaging consultation, is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs hoping to cash in. 
From a trickle of relatively unsophisticated gadgets four years ago, a variety of computerized imaging systems have emerged to aid people in picking hair styles and makeup, project the results of cosmetic dentistry, and help plastic surgeons plan and preview face lifts and make detailed video records of their patients' progress. 

   So far, the systems account for only a blip in computer sales. 
In the medical segment, for example, only about 250 of the nation's 6,200 plastic and cosmetic surgeons use imaging systems. 
But the potential is huge. 
Half of the nation's 260,000 beauty salons probably have enough customers to justify buying the systems, even at the current $15,000 average price. 

   Moreover, entrepreneurs on the front line of the nascent "personal care" computer industry are looking at even broader markets. 
Inamed Corp., whose principal business is making cosmetic surgery implants, has sold 80 imaging systems to plastic and cosmetic surgeons and has begun a push into general dentistry and orthodontia, which have about 155,000 practitioners. 

   The company, which is based in Santa Barbara, Calif., is also toying with a system that would show people how they will look if they lose weight. 
"They can take home a picture, paste it on the refrigerator and have a real incentive to skip the salami sandwich they're thinking about eating," says Michael Null, the president of Inamed's McGhan Instrumed Corp. subsidiary. 

   New Image Industries Inc., a closely held 10-month-old start-up, has already delivered about 500 hair-salon systems. 
Now it hopes to tap the potentially vast architectural and interior-design trades by showing "how the pool will fit into your back yard or what the wallpaper will look like before you put it up," says Robert Gurevitch, the president of the Woodland Hills, Calif., concern. 

   Video-imaging computers trace their origins to Pac-Man and the computer-graphics technology that started the video-game revolution. 
Essentially, the systems blend state-of-the-art video cameras and customized software with off-the-shelf computer hardware -- typically a 20-megabyte high-speed personal computer and a color-graphics board capable of digitizing video signals. 

   Some people believe that the systems are just a fad. 
The industry is so new -- probably 90% of the systems in use have been sold within the past two years -- that few analysts are even aware of it. 
But those who have watched it longest -- analysts in the $15 billion cosmetic industry, where imaging systems first appeared four years ago -- aren't convinced that the imaging wave will last any longer than last year's hair style. 

   The systems may make sense in medical fields, where large fees can support one-time use by patients, says Brenda Lee Landry, who tracks the cosmetics industry for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. But, she says, hair-care and cosmetic retailers have to rely on volume and repeat business for profit. 
"Once a person has had a session, I don't see them going back -- it tends to be a one-shot deal." 

   "People do this as a goof," adds Jack L. Salzman, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
He points to the experience of cosmetic giant Elizabeth Arden Inc. 
It rotates about a dozen computerized makeup simulators -- some of them costing $100,000 -- among scores of department stores so that the novelty won't wear off. 
As gimmicks, "these things get people into the department stores," says Mr. Salzman. 
But, he adds, "I just don't see women constantly flocking to a machine so they can stare at a humongous pore in their skin while deciding on the right moisturizer." 

   Imaging-system makers counter that recent price competition in the computer industry will continue to drive down component costs, making systems ever more affordable. 
One example: Simple dentistry simulators sell for as little as $6,000 today, compared with double that two years ago. 

   Some of the biggest believers are users. 
Mitch Mitchell, a salon owner and computer buff, had such faith in imaging technology that he spent $17,000 to build his own system last April. 
Since then, he has averaged 90 imaging customers a month, at $30 a sitting, in his Irvine, Calif., salon. 

   Mr. Mitchell believes that his system not only sells haircuts -- 75% of his imaging customers have stayed to get their hair done -- but also has virtually eliminated the most common stylist-customer conflict: misunderstanding over what is possible. 
"It's hard to have somebody in a chair and say to them, 'You have a horse face, the style you're describing will never look good on you,'" he says. 
"On the computer, however, you can show them: 'If we do this style, your face still looks long. 
But if we do this, we get a nice oval.'" 

   Mr. Mitchell concedes that he gets virtually no repeat imaging customers, but he says, "they'll come back in a couple of years when the styles change again." 

   Larry D. Schoenrock, a Santa Rosa, Calif., facial plastic surgeon, has used computer imaging with about 700 patients. 
He says that the system's chief benefit is allowing patients to get a more realistic expectation of results. 
One of his patients, hairdresser Chava Enos, agrees. 
She was afraid that the surgery she was contemplating might leave her looking like "somebody completely different." 
Instead, her portrait on Dr. Schoenrock's imaging system showed only subtle changes. 
"I appeared more rested and I liked that," she says. 
"It alleviated a lot of stress." 

   Still, some doctors caution that imaging systems can raise ethical and even legal issues if they aren't used conservatively. 
William Beeson, the public-information chairman for the American Academy for Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, worries that the systems can produce patient images that sell surgery but are impossible to deliver. 
"If you program them for results that can't be achieved," Dr. Beeson says, "you're going to have a problem."

<HEAD>`Toxic Sock Syndrome' and `Runner's Rump' Plague Athletes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sports medicine expert says ailments such as
``black heel,'' ``bikini bottom,'' ``jogger's nipples'' and ``toxic
sock syndrome'' bother athletes and fitness fans more often than
broken bones or strained muscles.
   Skin injuries such as these are among the most common of locker
room complaints, says medical professor Rodney S. W. Basler, whose
list of athletic ailments also includes ``runner's rump'' and
``surfer's nodules.''
   The skin ``bears the brunt of the punishment'' from exercise and
develops injuries in unexpected ways, Basler said Wednesday in an
interview at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
Dermatology.
   ``The percentage of people in fitness conditioning or good
athletic programs who develop some types of skin problems is quite
large. I wouldn't be surprised if three-quarters or four-fifths of
everybody in a fitness program has some type of skin injury,'' said
Basler, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center and a fitness medicine expert.
   Most of the skin injuries will go away when the exercise is
halted, he said, but the ailments can cause irritation, pain and
cosmetic concern.
   Joggers and marathoners, whose skin must endure hours of
punishment, are heir to a number of dermatological problems ranging
from black heel to runner's rump.
   Black heel develops when constant flexing of the foot causes two
layers of the skin, the dermis and the epidermis, to rub against
each other in a shearing force, said Basler. This breaks small blood
vessels and causes blood to pool between the skin layers, usually at
the heel. The result is blackened skin.
   The same problem can occur on the palms of baseball players,
golfers, weight-lifters and mountain climbers, Basler said.
   He said black heel will correct itself when the activity stops,
but many patients seek treatment because they worry about cancer.
   ``Runner's rump'' is a discoloration at the base of the spine,
where the buttocks come together. The doctor said it is a
pigmentation change caused by the friction of the buttocks rubbing
against each other. The only concern, said Basler, is cosmetic.
   ``Jogger's nipple'' is a more painful problem, usually
experienced by men.
   Basler said it develops among runners who wear shirts that are
not soft. The friction of the cloth during exercise rubs the nipples
raw. Few women experience the problem because they wear soft bras,
he said.
   ``It's surprising how big a problem this can be. It actually
stops some people from running,'' Basler said.
   Prevention is simple: wear a soft cotton undershirt, or cover the
nipples with petroleum jelly or paper medical tape _ or run
bare-chested.
   Pool chemicals can cause swimmers to develop a variety of skin
problems.
   Basler said many pools use bromide instead of chlorine to control
bacteria in the water and this can lead to a form of acne called
``bikini bottom.''
   The ailment usually consists of acne-like pimples and nodules,
most often on the backside.
   ``It looks very much like classic acne,'' said Basler, ``except
it's usually under the swimsuit.''
   Treatment and prevention are both achieved by ``not sitting
around in wet swimsuits,'' he said.
   Basler said some patients who swim frequently also come to him
because of light-colored hair that suddenly turns green.
   The color change is a result of copper in the pool water that
``gives a real distinctive greenish tint to the hair,'' he said. The
treatment is to bleach the hair with peroxide.
   Another water-related injury is actually considered a scar of
triumph, he said.
   He said people who spend hours riding the waves on boards develop
what is called ``surfer's nodules.'' These are bumps of hard tissue
that arise on the foot as a result of long-term contact with the
surf board. Often the bumps contain grains of sand.
   The nodules cause no harm, said Basler, and ``the surfers
consider them a badge of honor. They're proud of them.''
   All athletes who spend hours exercising in sweaty sneakers can
develop something that Basler calls ``toxic sock syndrome.''
   The ailment is characterized by an outrageously powerful foot
odor and is caused by a bacterium that grows in the soft tissue of
the feet. Left alone, it can cause pits to develop in the skin, he
said.
   Treatment is with over-the-counter acne medication containing
benzol peroxide, and prevention is accomplished by using more
absorbent socks and a foot powder.
   Athlete's foot, a fungal infection that can cause itching and
cracking between the toes, remains one of the major skin problems of
the locker room, the doctor said. Medication and care can clear it
up for three months or so, but most people will get it again, he
said, because the fungus takes advantage of a mild immune deficiency
that many people have.
   ``It's essentially an incurable problem,'' Basler said with a
sigh. ``I've had it for 25 years myself.''

   Investigators are trying to determine
whether the Ohio State Fair's grand champion steer, Hank, also goes
by the name Carl, a ribbon winner at an Illinois farm show.
   The key piece of evidence is a patch of white hair on Hank's
underside that had been dyed black, an Ohio state fair official said.
   Coloring the animal's hide is itself a violation, but fair
officials are also investigating whether Hank was shown as Carl
three weeks earlier at the Iroquois County Fair in Illinois, where
it won a second-place ribbon.
   If the allegation is true, the prize steer violates the rules of
both fairs because it was shown by different families and because it
fails to meet ownership requirements. An exhibitor must own and care
for the animal as of Jan. 1 to show at either fair.
   The Ohio 4-H, the Future Farmers of America and the state fair
have been gathering evidence for more than two weeks.
   When officials examined the Ohio fair's grand champion steer
after the competition Aug. 14, a dark dye was wiped from the steer's
abdomen. The dark-colored hairs have grown out.
   ``It is white,'' Jim Goard, director of livestock and agriculture
for the state fair, said Wednesday. ``It needs to match the spots on
pictures of the animal from Illinois, but it appears to be white,
and coloring an animal is a major violation in itself.''
   A white spot was visible in photos of Carl, shown by Jeremy
Simmons, 12, at the Iroquois County Fair on July 24.
   Hank was shown by Susan Shealy, 17, of Tiro, who could be forced
to forfeit her first-place ribbon and the $28,000 price the
Angus-cross steer brought at the fair. Her family could be banned
from showing at the fair for three or more years.
   Jeremy, of Donovan, Ill., also could face a penalty.
   Both families deny any wrongdoing.
   Hank has been in the custody of Ohio State University while his
hair grows out. Investigators visited OSU's beef barn Tuesday to
photograph the steer in postures similar to the stances shown in
photos of the Illinois winner.
   Jeremy's father, Donald Kopsell, has said Carl was destroyed
after eating tainted corn.
   State fair rules require investigators to make a recommendation
to the fair's Beef, Sheep and Swine Committee. The committee must
recommend action to the nine-member Ohio Expositions Commission,
which runs the fair.
   ``If they call for a hearing, all parties will be notified and
given a chance to tell their side of the story,'' Jack Foust,
general manager of the fair.

S.D. SCHOOL DRESS CODES -- 'RELAXED' ABOUT COVERS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE M. SPEARNAK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent Times article explored an East Coast trend toward the use of uniforms 
in public schools. This article looks at school dress codes in San Diego County 
and a move to follow the East Coast lead. 
</P>
<P>
The dress code at La Jolla High School is simple, explains Vice Principal 
Cassandra Countryman. Students can wear almost anything as long as it is 
appropriate for school and doesn't disrupt the "learning environment." 
</P>
<P>
But what, exactly, does she consider disruptive? Nose rings, ripped jeans, 
spiked hair? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," said the no-nonsense administrator. "If it shows your 
(derriere), it's inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to high school dressing in the '80s, where students can wear ripped 
jeans, if certain parts of their anatomy don't show, pink hair, if nobody 
cares, and white pancake makeup that makes them look like devotees of Marcel 
Marceau. 
</P>
<P>
No longer must students worry about the restrictive dress rules that existed in 
the '60s and early '70s. Today's high school dress codes request decency and 
little more. "We have them cover their bottoms and their tops, and that's about 
it," said Joan Adler, vice principal at Mission Bay High. 
</P>
<P>
Today's dress codes are so relaxed that several students admitted they didn't 
even know rules existed. Perhaps that's a tribute to their desire to dress 
neatly and stylishly. Or it could be their ignorance. Either way, most are 
adamant in saying they like and appreciate the leniency. 
</P>
<P>
"The way you dress is really an important part of you," explained Oliver 
Andriesse, 16, of Crawford High School, who accessorizes his basically black 
outfit with an earring, a Mickey Mouse watch and hair gel. "The school already 
teaches you how to act and how to think. If they tell you what to wear, we 
might be wearing uniforms. We would be like a little army." 
</P>
<P>
Not every student believes the dress code should be as flexible as it is, 
including Lisa Gomez, 16, who wouldn't mind wearing a uniform to school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more convenient. You wouldn't have to take 10 minutes out in the morning 
to decide what to wear," said the Crawford High student. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are uniforms convenient, they can save students -- and their parents 
-- money. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Principal Lowell Billings at West View School in South Bay hopes to 
institute a voluntary uniform policy at his elementary school, where 25% of the 
students come from low-income families. The school district's Board of Trustees 
approved the plan in August, and parents are now reviewing it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing parents going broke trying to buy the latest tennis shoes and 
T-shirts for their kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan is approved, students would be able to opt for the uniform. Because 
West View is a public school, uniforms cannot legally be required. Billings 
hopes to design an outfit pleasing enough that most of his 450 students would 
rather wear it than their own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Another South Bay school, Pence Elementary, has been chosen as a pilot school 
for a voluntary dress code, which may begin as soon as January. 
</P>
<P>
High school students are more likely to rebel at wearing a uniform. Robin Hunt, 
a freshman at Mission Bay, thinks students would complain at any suggestion of 
a more severe dress code. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people know how to dress and what's right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With all the freedom students have to bend such relaxed rules, surprisingly few 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get out of hand. Students don't take advantage of the dress code, 
because they can wear whatever they want," said Bashiri Cooper, a 16-year-old 
Crawford High student whose tastes run to shorts, T-shirts and some serious 
high-top tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I think our kids look very sharp," said Augie Bregante, vice 
principal at Crawford. A longtime educator, Bregante remembers when the rules 
were far from lenient -- when boys' hair had to be short but girls' skirts 
couldn't follow suit. "When I was teaching 25 years ago, boys couldn't wear 
their shirttails out. Today that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bregante spends more time worrying about whether his students might be 
wearing clothes emblazoned with gang insignia -- one type of clothing 
absolutely forbidden at Crawford and high schools throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being asked to wear clothes that do not disrupt the learning 
environment, high school students throughout the county follow brief guidelines 
regarding dress. 
</P>
<P>
Most schools forbid T-shirts advertising alcohol, tobacco, drugs, sex or 
anything obscene. Students cannot expose obviously inappropriate areas of their 
torso. They are asked to dress "appropriately," however they may interpret 
that. The only absolute is that they must wear shoes -- a state law. 
</P>
<P>
Anything that may convey gang membership, from an earring to a colored bandanna 
in the pocket, is strictly verboten and taken seriously by school officials. 
April Reeves, a 17-year-old student council member at Mission Bay High, was 
called to the office once when she wrapped a bandanna around her ankle as part 
of an outfit. Administrators asked her to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
Dress codes began changing in the late '60s, when students and their parents 
started filing lawsuits against restrictive rules, challenging rights to 
freedom of expression. Dress regulations fell away as quickly as students began 
winning those cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that in some cases, our dress code was an infringement on the 
rights of the students," said Al Cook, an assistant superintendent for San 
Diego city schools who was a vice principal in 1968. "For example, today it 
would be hard to justify why boys were not allowed to wear shorts. Back then, 
they could merely say it was unacceptable or not in good taste." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before students began challenging the rules in court. When a 
student at a San Diego high school was suspended for dying his hair green 
during the late '60s, then won a court challenge, dress codes began to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Today's students might notice a classmate with green hair, but they would 
hardly be as astonished as they were 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We always get some kids every year who dye their hair every color under the 
sun," said Mission Bay's Adler, who, like other administrators, barely bats an 
eyelash over such costumery. 
</P>
<P>
Following court challenges across the nation, schools began turning to the 
community and its residents to help them set dress standards. The relaxed code 
at Mission Bay High reflects the easygoing nature of Pacific Beach, Adler says. 
Students wear shorts more often than at other schools, along with lots of 
bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Lopez, a senior who commutes from Paradise Hills to attend advanced 
classes at Mission Bay High, doesn't care for the beachy look. Dressed in a 
black mini-skirt, cropped top and blazer, Emma said she would rather see 
students dress more conservatively, and in darker colors. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many shorts. I think it's kind of sad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Illicit T-shirts create the biggest dress code problem at the county's high 
schools. During the first week of classes at Poway High, Gary Price spotted a 
student wearing a shirt advertising Mr. Zog's Sex Wax. Luckily, the young 
administrator knew what the product was. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex Wax. It's a real wax. I use it on my surfboard. But we can't have that 
kind of thing around school. So we asked him to reverse his shirt," Price said. 
"Kids here are allowed their individuality to a point. But when it's 
interfering with the educational process, then we call the students out of the 
classroom and discuss it with them." 
</P>
<P>
Price said he has more trouble with Poway students who are tardy for class than 
he does with dress code violators. "For the most part, the kids at Poway dress 
fairly nicely. They're clean and they're well-groomed. But then, this is a 
fairly affluent area." 
</P>
<P>
Affluency seems to have little to do with whether students violate the dress 
rules. Although most Crawford High students don't have the money to buy their 
wardrobes at Nordstrom, students there looked as neat, albeit different, as 
those at Poway or Mission Beach High, a middle-income school. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators concede that one reason they continue to maintain a flexible 
dress code is to avoid court challenges, which crop up across the country from 
time to time. In 1987, a high school in Northern California rescinded its 
controversial ban on T-shirts and clothing advertising beer because it feared 
costly legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials also stress that students are more conservative today than 
during the '60s and less apt to challenge the rules. Although a dress code 
infraction today might consist of an obscene T-shirt, problems during the '60s 
were often more outrageous.

Cathy Hopper remembers working as a vice principal at Patrick Henry High when 
she was called to talk to a girl wearing an army overcoat with nothing 
underneath. When the girl's mother arrived to take her daughter home, the woman 
berated Hopper for not allowing her daughter to dress as she liked. 
</P>
<P>
That fashion idea would never win the approval of Kristie Gudith. Although the 
17-year-old readily acknowledges that she loves to wear skin-tight jeans, "the 
kind that cut the circulation off," with blouses and painted T-shirts, she 
wishes more students at Crawford High would dress up and wear the skirts, heels 
and jeans she favors. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks of Crawford as a poor school already. I think it would help 
the school's image," she said. And perhaps students' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids act in different ways depending on how they dress," said Mission Bay's 
Adler. "In education, things always seem to come full circle. . . . I see us 
moving into a more conservative era, with more attention to dress codes. As we 
learn more about what impacts behavior, we may pay more attention to dress."

<F P=106> [Text of communique by Subcommander Marcos from the Zapatist </F>
National Liberation Army (EZLN), addressed to the weekly 
newspaper PROCESO, the national newspapers LA JORNADA and EL 
FINANCIERO, and the San Cristobal de Las Casas newspaper TIEMPO, 
dated 3 June] 
  [Text] Gentlemen: Communiques citing "representatives" and 
information on the consultations are on their way. The clouds 
lean lazily on the sides of the mountains here. The sun is 
light gray and somnolent. The day is already a humid whisper 
dragging itself along amid the mud and thorns. Here's to you: 
health and an alarm clock (so as not to stay asleep). 
  From the mountains in southeastern Mexico, Insurgent 
Subcommander Marcos. Mexico, June 1994. 
  Postscript for Nuncio, Abraham. The rocket [previous word in 
English] was shot down. The antiaircraft team commanded by El 
Beto (eight slings and eight very good marksmen) detected the 
rocket when it was about to land, 20 meters before its tip 
touched the ground. Eight stones, little stones, rough stones 
gave it the kiss of death on its right flank. As someone about 
to lie down, the rocket tipped to one side. Our people, as is 
customary, organized a party. When they were bringing the 
marimba, El Beto approached the fallen rocket and said: "It is 
paper and cannot be eaten...yet." No one heard him; the marimba 
was already beginning to play the song Carta Marcada and the 
couples, using the rain as an excuse, squeezed closer together. 
We had to wait for the arrival of the newspaper, which 
absurdly, as everything here, came via facsimile. The photocopy 
of the rocket remained filed under "R" (for "Rocket" as well as 
"Reproaches"). Greetings to Monterrey, the land of the brave. 
  Cinematographic postscript. 
  Aerial shot. It is raining. The gray from above and the 
moisture will make these lands green again. The burning of 
fields is over; something new is beginning to appear amid the 
rocks and mountains. 
  Traveling shot. [Previous two words in English] Dirt, vines, 
and tall grass (they call them "houses" here). Women wash 
clothes in the stream very carefully, because "if they are 
scrubbed too hard, the clothes get torn and there is no thread 
to mend them." A boy is pretending an empty flip top [previous 
two words in English] cigarette box is a truck, loading it with 
pebbles. "They are sacks of corn," he tells the EZLN guard at 
the checkpoint who, amid the rain, tries to cover the boy with a 
piece of nylon [previous word in English]. It is useless, 
however; the truck is driving away from the checkpoint, and the 
guard must return to his position. Tonita washes her face with 
the rainwater she has collected in a can of light [previous word 
in English] drink. In an old wooden building, the only building 
with a metal roof (they call it "the school" here), amid dark 
faces, black eyes, mud-laden boots, old shirts, and red 
bandannas, men with mustaches discuss war and peace. The guard 
at the EZLN headquarters shivers coldly under the frayed plastic 
roof. The pole men from the barges arrive soaking wet: half 
sweat and half rain but all mud. Cold hands gather around the 
fire, weaving stories of big hats, squawk boxes [cajitas 
parlantes], and women who walk at night. El Beto stretches the 
opening of a balloon, which he has filled with water, and plays 
at making it rain. The water falls into the puddle at his feet. 
Moises and Tacho gaze at the swollen river then try to cross it 
on a wooden raft. No one says a word, they stare at the brown 
water as if they were looking at life. 
  Longshot [previous word in English]. Maria, 30 years old 
with eight live children ("four of them died"), emerges at the 
bend of the main road carrying a pack of wood on her back: the 
weight, the leather strap [mecapal], and the mud force her to 
look down. She also carries an axe in her right hand. Josefa, 
15, follows her with another wobbly pack of wood. Josefa is 
unconcerned about the mud; she is making sure the leather strap 
does not mess up her hair or pull out the eight "hairpins" she 
has fastened to her hair. Another bundle of wood follows, a 
scant few feet above the ground. Underneath it, barefoot, is 
Pedro, 8, one hand carrying a machete, the other holding the 
leather strap to help balance the weight on his head. 
  Medium shot [previous two words in English]. Hortensia, an 
EZLN rebel and seamstress, proudly shows off her latest 
achievement: she has made a pair of pants out of five torn and 
ripped pairs. When she shows the pants to the men, they all 
remember they have something to do elsewhere. Hortensia remains 
with the pants in her hands: It has four different colors and, 
inadvertently, she says, a little flower at the crotch. 
  Closeup [previous word in English]. Half covered by brown 
shirt sleeves, two hands use an awl and thick thread to mend a 
boot that has more scars than the back of Ahab's whale. The red 
bandanna provides relief for the blisters. 
  Upward shot. Under a puckered brow, two eyes dance from one 
side to another, lips begin to move and, amid quiet, whisper: 
  "Let my voice rise to the mountains 
  and fall to the ground as thunder, 
  that is what my throat would like 
  from now on and forever." 
  Downward shot. Someone is reading, with a rifle across his 
thighs. The words, sadly, reach out. 
  "Yesterday the people woke up 
  naked with nothing to wear, and 
  starving, with nothing to eat, 
  and today the day broke 
  justly stormily 
  and bleeding justly. 
  In their hands, the rifles 
  want to become like lions 
  to get rid of the beasts 
  they've had to face over and over. 
  Even if you have no weapons, 
  people of a hundred thousand powers, 
  do not let your mettle fail you, 
  get back at those who hurt you 
  as long as you have fists, 
  nails, saliva, and still have a 
  spine, heart, and guts, 
  your manly attributes and teeth." 
  A right hand reaches out and turns the page of the book by 
Miguel Hernandez. The lens loses focus, hesitates, and then 
refocuses, zeroing in on the paragraph: 
  "I am here to live 
  as long as my soul can dream, 
  and I am here to die 
  whenever my time is come, 
  in the bosom of my people, 
  from now on and forever. 
  Life is several swallows, 
  but death is simply one. 
  Audio off. "Who's there?" "The Fatherland." The echo can be 
heard amid the rain and the fog; the sound of feet squishing in 
the mud begins anew. 
  Fade out. The color green splattered with brown and red, 
sort 
of hidden behind the gray and the final wink of the camera 
shutter. 
  Audio off. A faraway plane fades into nothingness in the 
air.... 
  It is over. The Sup [name as published] behind the lens 
stupidly believes that the word play [preceding word in English] 
on the camera really means "to play"... [jugar].

   ``Feel'' (RCA) _ Human Drama
   
   Sometimes you can judge a record by its cover.
   Johnny Indovina, the singer-leader of Human Drama, poses on
``Feel'' with bare chest, beads and necklaces, black nail polish
and crucifix earring, his face darkened by shadows, his hair
hanging in front of his eyes like a mask.
   This is music for the white makeup, black leather and big
moussed hair set. It's gloom and doom rock with plenty of angst
thrown in.
   ``Feel'' is this Los Angeles-based group's first album. It's
similar in tone to The Smiths, Joy Division or The Cure _ but on
the Despair-o-Meter, Human Drama comes out on top.
   Indovina yelps, favors a sobby vibrato, and uses the Pained
Hiccup Effect in his vocals.
   His alienated voice is alienating. His songs may have arisen
from genuinely deep pain, but it's difficult to share that pain
with him. His lyrics are mostly obscure and cryptic.
   Send in the undertakers _ or maybe a psychiatrist.
   ``So deep it burns, I burn until I cry, I die,'' Indovina sings
on ``Death of an Angel.'' Then, on ``Dying in a Moment of
Splendor,'' Indovina relates, ``I am an artist with a vision seeing
hell his destiny.'' And in ``There Is Only You,'' Indovina sings
about coming close to suicide _ though it might be just fantasy.
   So Johnny feels bad, but why?
   Is it the ozone layer? Toxic wastes? Love gone sour? Addiction?
   Indovina refers to an inner battle between Good and Evil, which
could be tied to the struggle with addiction he relates in
``Tumble'' and ``Never Never.''
   References to angels, heaven, God, demons, Easter, the Golden
Rule and prayers are sprinkled through ``Feel.'' It's too bad a
little holy water couldn't have been sprinkled, too, because this
record sounds anything but celestial.
   It takes more courage to sing about inner struggles than about
cars and girls. But Indovina lacks the directness of a Tracy
Chapman or Bruce Springsteen that makes the pain personal enough to
touch the hearts of an audience.

   ``Smoking in the Fields'' (RCA) _ The Del Fuegos
   
   The Del Fuegos color the world like autumn. Burnt orange,
russet, siena, sepia.
   On ``Smoking in the Fields,'' they sound like they've been
through the lighthearted spring and summer, and now are living in a
season where things are more serious and the winds blow harder, but
where flashes of color and cozy blankets give warmth.
   ``I'll stand by you when you're feelin' tired, gray and old;
honey I will be, too,'' Dan Zanes sings on ``Stand By You.'' The
track is the most stripped-down on the album, featuring just Zanes,
an acoustic guitar and a little help from unobtrusive strings and
backing vocals.
   Most of the rest of this album is barroom stomp rock that would
be in good company alongside Jason and the Scorchers or the LeRoi
Brothers. The Fuegos get pumped on ``Move With Me Sister'' and ``No
No Never,'' then slow down into the mid-tempo ``Part of This
Earth'' and a blues-tinted jam on ``Lost Weekend.''
   Guitars carry the tunes, and Tom Lloyd's bass is mixed up high
enough to give a weighty feel. Horns add brightness. But harmonica
work by the J. Geils Band's Magic Dick lends the most distinctive
texture to the album.
   Zanes' whiskey-over-gravel voice trademarks the stuff as the
Fuegos'.
   It's been 2{ years since the last Del Fuegos album _ the bomb
``Stand Up.'' Since then, the band has switched record labels and
producers.
   Mitchell Froom, who produced the band's first three records, is
replaced by Dave Thoener. The result, ``Smoking in the Fields,'' is
an OK rock album with a gritty tinge. But it doesn't dazzle.

BATTLE OF THE BLONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gaile Robinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whose blondness looks better, Ivana Trump's or Madonna's? And what is the state 
of the art in cities between Hollywood and New York? 
</P>
<P>
Stylist Gina Furth, whose own hair is flaming red, turns out to be an expert on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Furth, based at the Yuki Salon in West Hollywood, recently made an informal 
study of blond variations during a cross-country trek as part of a television 
project on the Judds, the mother-daughter country music singing team. CBS was 
filming the singers, Furth was styling their hair. Hers is a highly personal 
vision of the state of blondness across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have you seen much change in blonds over the last few years? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've been doing this for 25 years. The blonds have really evolved. The 
California blond is like nothing else in the world. It's the best blond there 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ours is a warmer blond, with more tones. It is a blond-on-blond look instead 
of one all over color. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have you found people are asking for a specific blond? 
</P>
<P>
A: Candice Bergen. They want that color hair. It's elegant and it's not flashy. 
It has a beige or taupe background and there is no flash. No one ever asks me 
for Madonna. But the two process blonds (bleach and toner) are having a big 
revival since Madonna did hers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the time Ivana Trump had solid yellow blond, did anyone ever want 
that? 
</P>
<P>
A: That butter color? That color in this city's light is so hard and offensive. 
Nobody wants to look like that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of hair styles do Los Angeles women want? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hair is much messier here than anywhere else. It's much sexier. It's wilder, 
but on purpose. It's not like a tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What color did you see on the East Coast? 
</P>
<P>
A: In New York there are pretty Connecticut blonds, but in the city they are 
all brunettes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why? A: It works better in the city's natural light, and it's the more 
formal side of dress. Brown hair lends itself to a more pulled together look. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If they go blond what color do they choose? 
</P>
<P>
A: Same as here, blond-on-blond, that Bistro Garden look. Except we use a 
deeper, richer color base with brighter highlights. The color is similar in New 
York but the contrast between the highlights and base is not as extreme. Or 
they go for the Grace Kelly East Coast blond look, cool and elegant. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is a good New York blond, Ivana? 
</P>
<P>
A: She looks fabulous, but it's a more Hollywood look. I didn't see any good 
blonds in the city. They are all brunettes, like Carolyne Roehm and Donna 
Karan, the fashion designers. They wear great blazers and swingy brunette hair. 
It's a rich look. In New York, women are not as pretty as they are put 
together. They look drop-dead. 
</P>
<P>
Q: That takes care of the fashion capitals, what about points in between. 
</P>
<P>
A: In Washington, the women are not concerned with fashion. They talk about 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You can't be blond and talk about issues? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can't be focused on fashion. They don't want to look too flashy or 
stylish because people will want to know how they did that on a politician's 
salary -- which is a legitimate concern. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How about Nashville? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nashville is real glitz. Everyone there is done to death. It's a look all 
its own. Higher heels, wider shoulders and taller hair. They take a trend and 
run with it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How would you describe their hair? 
</P>
<P>
A: That Southern belle look. They all have hairdos. Usually a magnified version 
of the old shag, really jacked up in front and big. And there are tons of 
blonds. Nashville is loaded with bright blonds, either golden yellow or that 
white blond. Everybody gets their hair done. These women, I'm telling you, are 
pretty. They have small noses and wholesome looks like Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are the country stars you work on in Nashville different from the 
rock-'n'-rollers from Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
A: I love these people. They are very much not in the princess mode of 
Hollywood. They work out of tour buses. They take on a whole different demeanor 
when it comes to real life. Theirs is far more real, they eat at truck stops 
not Spago, Motel 6's as opposed to the Hilton's. They are pretty 
self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a blond mentality? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think for girls who come to Hollywood thinking of being stars, being blond 
is part of the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Were you ever a blond? 
</P>
<P>
A: I was blond for years. I was younger then and it only looked good if I was 
tan and rested. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you doing more blonds these days? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've taken a lot of blonds to red recently, to a lighter strawberry red. You 
can't be sure if it's blond or red. As you get older, it is a good idea to 
soften the hard reds or yellows. The more colors you put in the hair the easier 
it is to maintain. Plus, it's more flattering. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who would keep mousy brown hair? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nobody. They'd go blond.

   Newly crowned Miss America Gretchen
Elizabeth Carlson, a classical violinist and Stanford University
student with hopes of law school, said Sunday she plans to become a
corporate executive.
   ``I'm definitely an overachiever,'' she told reporters.
   ``This wasn't luck,'' said Miss Carlson, entered in the pageant
as Miss Minnesota, said of her selection as Miss America 1989. She
added that she is not superstitious and brought no good-luck charms
to the pageant.
   Miss Carlson, 22, of Anoka, Minn., performed a spirited violin
solo titled ``Gypsy Airs.'' She has been studying violin for 17
years, winning national and state competitions and performing a
solo with the Minnesota Orchestra.
   After winning a preliminary talent competition last week, she
confidently told reporters parts of her performance were
``exquisite.''
   Pageant officials took pains this year to emphasize that the
judges were looking for an ``articulate, educated, dynamic role
model'' and not a beauty queen.
   Miss Carlson was crowned early Sunday by her predecessor, Kaye
Lani Rae Rafko. The selection of Miss America 1989 was delayed
almost 12 minutes when judges had to cast new ballots to break a
tie for second runner-up.
   During the delay, Miss Carlson said, ``I'd lost confidence. ...
I really thought it was all over at that point. I saw a judge look
down at a book and look at a picture and shake their head and I
thought, `Oh, no, it's me!'''
   Miss Carlson is several credits away from graduating from
Stanford with a degree in organizational behavior. She said she
would like to attend Harvard Law School ``and become a successful
corporate executive.''
   For the next year, she will tour the country promoting not only
the Miss America scholarship program but also the products of the
pageant's corporate sponsors, including underwear, orange juice,
pantyhose and hair coloring.
   Miss Rafko, a registered nurse, used her reign to promote the
nursing field.
   Miss Carlson said she would like to focus on ``education for the
children of tomorrow.'' Specifically, she would like to see
children receive more education on values, ``teaching children to
be less narcissistic.''
   ``Today children tend to be more in love with themselves instead
of being in love with other people,'' she said.
   When asked what kind of Miss America she would make, Miss
Carlson laughed and replied: ``A short one.'' She stands 5-foot-3.
   Miss Carlson, a green-eyed blonde of Swedish descent, admitted
she lightens her hair with hair coloring but said contestants
``should not be allowed to change their bodies'' through cosmetic
surgery, as some have.
   Miss Carlson said that when she was 16 she weighed about 128
pounds. She now weighs 108.
   ``When I used to be fat, my brothers used to call me `blimpo,'
'' she said. ``I wanted to go out with the star basketball player
at school and he said, `She's such a nice girl but she's just a
little too plump.'
   ``So I went on this major diet and lost all this weight and then
he wanted to go out with me, but I said no.''
   Miss Carlson also said she would like to see the Miss America
pageant include a scholarship category. The competition now has
talent, swimsuit, evening gown and interview categories.
   Leonard Horn, pageant executive director, said, ``It's not a new
suggestion. The problem is that grade point average doesn't always
mean that much. ... There are a lot of successful people whose GPA
wasn't that enviable.''
   The last Miss Minnesota to win the title of Miss America was
Dorothy Benham in 1977.

STYLE: IVANA'S FRENCH TWIST IS NOW ALL THE RAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since Ivana Trump appeared on the May cover of Vogue looking 15 years younger 
and sporting a blond topknot on her head, Orange County hair stylists have been 
doing the twist -- the French twist. 
</P>
<P>
In a single sweep of her tresses, Ivana showed women everywhere how a new hair 
style, not to mention a little plastic surgery, could turn one into a youthful 
cover girl. 
</P>
<P>
Almost overnight, stylists began getting requests for French twists from local 
Ivana-bes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing more up-dos than we've done in a long time," says David Cope, 
owner of Copa de Ramo in San Juan Capistrano. "The style is soft and pretty, 
and we haven't had pretty in a long time. Everything's been hard and angular 
and bobbed." 
</P>
<P>
In a given week, he has about a dozen clients asking for some variation of the 
French twist. 
</P>
<P>
At Flora Hills in Corona del Mar, soft, casual twists with tousled tops have 
become desirable among clients wanting a change, as Ivana did. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime a woman wears her hair up it makes her feel sexier," says Flora Hills, 
owner of the boutique and salon. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ivana, some of Hills' customers want a French twist to go with their new 
face lifts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times a face lift isn't that drastic of a change," Hills says. "But 
if a woman changes her hair style, her clothes and her makeup, she'll have a 
whole new look. She'll even begin to walk differently." 
</P>
<P>
The French twist has been out of favor for so long, many women don't know what 
to call it. They just ask for a 'vana. 
</P>
<P>
"Ivana went from one extreme look to another, and people noticed the hair 
style. It looked great on her," says Shelly Serrecchio, owner of Cy-Raks salon 
in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Other customers, especially younger women, want the tousled twist made famous 
by Claudia Schiffer and her seductive ads for Guess? jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody notices that girl," Serrecchio says. 
</P>
<P>
The French twist Schiffer wears differs from the Brigitte Bardot version that 
inspired it. Schiffer's is a lot messier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more relaxed and sexier than the '60s," says Sharon Orr, salon manager of 
Aida Grey in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "It has a little pouf to it, but I 
don't want to say bouffant because I don't want to scare people." 
</P>
<P>
Today's twist calls for a less structured look with loose tendrils of hair 
falling around the face. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the French twist had more of a beehive look, almost as if the 
head was pointed in back like a cone head," Cope says. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the twist should look "as if you grasped the hair in one hand, twisted 
it and stuck one pin in it. That's the effect you want," Cope says. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes that's a lot harder to achieve than a sleek look. Anybody can 
back-comb and spray, but it's harder to make it look messy. You have to have a 
good eye to know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Myla Renee, a stylist at Aida Grey, practiced doing a twist on fellow stylist 
Pam Frey, who sometimes wears her blond hair in a French twist to work during 
the day or to go dancing at night. 
</P>
<P>
Renee begins by using hot rollers to put soft waves in Frey's fairly straight 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
"If the hair is straight and silky, the style will slide right out," Renee 
says. "You wouldn't need to do this for processed hair." 
</P>
<P>
With a round brush and blow dryer, she adds slight curl to the bangs at the 
crown to create the volume needed for a tousled top. A gel or mousse can also 
give a little lift to hair that tends to fall flat, Renee says. 
</P>
<P>
To make the twist, Renee pulls the hair up and toward the back for an uplifting 
look. She sweeps the hair to one side, anchors it in place with a row of bobby 
pins, then twists the remaining hair with her hands. 
</P>
<P>
She secures the coil up along the back of the head with more bobby pins. When 
she comes to the end of the twist, the remaining hair is wrapped around in a 
loose topknot. 
</P>
<P>
Renee leaves wispy tendrils of hair to frame the face, picking at them with a 
small comb and squirting them lightly with hair spray to add fullness. 
</P>
<P>
"It should look as if you just stepped out of a convertible," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Stylists can invent endless variations of the French twist. The bangs can fall 
forward, as Ivana's do, or sweep to the side, as the Guess? model's do. The 
topknot can be large or small, and sit either forward or toward the back of the 
head. For Ivana, the grander the affair, the larger her topknot. 
</P>
<P>
French twists work best when one has shoulder-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobs won't work," Serrecchio says. 
</P>
<P>
Older women like the style because it lifts up from their face, giving them a 
youthful appearance. Younger women, meanwhile, look more sophisticated with 
their hair up. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can wear a French twist," Serrecchio says. "I've done a 16-year-old 
girl who was going to be in a wedding, and I've done a modified version for 
older women that wasn't as messy." 
</P>
<P>
Stylists say the twist is especially popular with brides and bridesmaids 
because it looks sophisticated and complements the headpiece. Others wear it to 
the beach, to work or to parties. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Beck, a stylist at Europa International in Fashion Island, Newport Beach, 
says his clients want a French twist to wear to special occasions, such as a 
night to hear a performance by Opera Pacific or a formal fund-raiser. At a 
recent fashion show for Nordstrom, Beck gave all models with shoulder-length 
hair a French twist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really uplifting look," he says. "My mom's been wearing it for years. 
It's easy and it looks sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
If the hair is dry, Beck says, anyone can do a French twist in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't overdo it, don't overwork it," he says. "That's when you start looking 
like a schoolmarm."

   Cover Girl Is Growing Up and Moving Out
   As Its New Parent, P&amp;G, Takes Charge

   Cover Girl has a new face.
   And it's turning heads at the Thrift Drug store in
Pittsburgh's posh Fox Chapel suburb. Once the hit among giddy
teen-agers, the cosmetics line is now attracting more mature
shoppers. "Cover Girl is a reason people shop here," says
Ralph Petri, a vice president of the drugstore chain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cover Girl is growing up under the watchful eye of new
parent Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Although P&amp;G has owned the brand
for only 18 months, Cover Girl is already more upscale and
aggressive. The Cincinnati consumer products concern has
invested heavily to beef up advertising, packaging and new
product launches, including a longer-lasting lipstick. And
researchers are working on a new generation of skin-care
products to appeal to aging baby boomers fretting about
wrinkles.
   With Cover Girl's makeover well under way, P&amp;G is also
looking around for other cosmetics makers to acquire. It is
considered the frontrunner to buy some -- and possibly all --
of Revlon Inc.'s line.
   P&amp;G's foray into cosmetics comes at a time of upheaval in
the industry, when stellar brand names are losing their
cachet. Shoppers are increasingly abandoning hard-sell
department stores for discount outlets and specialty
boutiques.
   "There's a lot of dissatisfaction among consumers" and
they're switching where they shop, says Wendy Liebmann, who
heads WSL Marketing, a New York consulting firm specializing
in cosmetics. "People are tired of being spritzed and
attacked when they come through the door at Bloomingdale's."
   Indeed, a recent industry survey showed that department
store sales accounted for 31.7% of sales in 1989, down from
33% in 1988. But mass merchandisers' share climbed to 14.1%
from 13.4% in the same period.
   And Cover Girl is enjoying its share of growth as shoppers
migrate. The brand now has 23% of the mass market, a steady
climb up from 21% in 1986, according to estimates from
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. Maybelline is second with 17%, down
from 19% in 1986.
   It's likely to keep growing because "it delivers good
value in a more glamorous look than in years gone by," says
Allison Cohen, a senior vice president who does consumer
research for Ally &amp; Gargano, a New York advertising agency.
   At chains like Thrift Drug, Cover Girl now shares display
space with pricey brands like Estee Lauder and Elizabeth
Arden. Thrift has expanded its cosmetics aisles into trendy
boutiques featuring pink walls and parquet wood floors. A
cosmetician signs up customers for free makeovers using
different product lines. But shoppers can also help
themselves to blush and eyeliner, a freedom that doesn't
exist in department stores. "Instead of one or two items,
they'll buy four or five," says Craig Sinclair, a Thrift vice
president.
   When P&amp;G bought Cover Girl and its parent company Noxell
Corp. in 1989 for $1.3 billion in stock, the brand was
fading. "In order to grow the company, {Noxell} had to take
money from ads for Noxema and Cover Girl. That weakened the
marketing position," says F. Stone Roberts, chief operating
officer of Lintas, the New York advertising agency that
handled Cover Girl until P&amp;G's acquisition.
   Still, P&amp;G recognized Cover Girl's strong foundation:
After working at it for years, the brand knocked Maybelline
from first place in 1986. P&amp;G also admired Noxell's research
roots. Founder George Avery Bunting, a Baltimore pharmacist,
got his start in 1917 selling a coffee pot brew of clove and
eucalyptus oils in little blue jars. After a customer
declared the cream "knocked my eczema," the sunburn remedy
was named Noxzema.
   In the early 1960s, Noxell launched Cover Girl as a
foundation to conceal acne. "To take the stigma off the
product, it was positioned as makeup worn by famous models,"
recalls Mr. Roberts. While it became the best-selling mass
market brand, it never competed with upscale,
department-store brands.
   P&amp;G didn't waste any time shaking up Cover Girl. It
speeded and expanded a package redesign for all Cover Girl
products that had been under way when it took over. Cover
Girl eye shadows are now stamped with a textured imprint that
makes them appear more upscale. And the old-fashioned beige
packaging has been replaced with bright white highlighted
with more contemporary typeface and graphics. The look is
ritzier, but the products are still budget priced.
   P&amp;G is also spending more to introduce products. A
lipstick called Lip Advance that was rolled out last January
is a hit because the two-step powder and top coat stays on
longer and doesn't cake as much as traditional lipsticks.
   Consumers are being bombarded with new Cover Girl ads. For
the first nine months of 1990, P&amp;G spent an estimated $47.5
million on Cover Girl advertising, up 58% from a year
earlier, before its acquisition, according to figures from
Leading National Advertisers Inc.
   A recent campaign called "Redefining Beautiful" features
models with a more natural look and a variety of ages, hair
colors and styles. For instance, the April issue of New Woman
magazine has a Cover Girl ad for Thick Lash mascara featuring
a very young short-haired brunette named Roberta Chirko. But
a second ad acknowledges that cover girls age: Fortysomething
Jennifer O'Neill, an early model for the brand, now models
Replenishing Make-Up, which promises "you'll see less of tiny
lines."
   There are hurdles ahead. For starters, the name Cover Girl
hardly appeals to career women or even aging housewives.
"There's an inherent limitation in the name," says Mr.
Roberts of Lintas. Moreover, competition is heating up. While
department stores are losing customers, cosmetics boutiques
like the Body Shop, along with specialty clothing chains like
Benetton, are successfully wooing them with distinct brands.
The Body Shop, which features all-natural skin-care and
makeup, has been highly successful in Britain and Europe and
is now expanding rapidly into Canada and the U.S.
   But P&amp;G has the technological and marketing clout to fight
back: By next year, Cover Girl could well be ready to launch
a new line of skin-care products. And such products will have
a speedier trip around the globe, especially in Europe, where
a P&amp;G team is already plotting strategy.
   Unilever Group is doing the same with its Calvin Klein
Cosmetics Co. The Anglo-Dutch company will soon introduce
Obsession fragrance products in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland. Unilever is also spending on Elizabeth Arden
products and other cosmetics acquired since 1989. The company
is now the No. 3 player in department store cosmetics, behind
Estee Lauder Inc. and L'Oreal S.A.
   Upscale Revlon, which includes Max Factor, Almay and
Ultima II, would give P&amp;G the greater mass needed to build
global markets. P&amp;G would probably concentrate on drugstore
and mass merchandise outlets, where it already controls shelf
space, rather than department stores. "Procter would focus on
its strengths and pound away," says Suzanne Grayson, an
industry consultant.

BUSY WOMEN OPT FOR EASY-CARE STYLES WITH VERSATILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ROSE-MARIE TURK, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, actress Brooke Palance took the plunge. She went from so-so 
shoulder-length hair to a chic, freewheeling style that is showing up on savvy 
women around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The cut of the season is short and boyish at the nape of the neck with feminine 
fullness through the crown. A longer top layer and subtle internal layering 
make for wash-and-wear ease, myriad styling possibilities and freedom from most 
hair-styling products. 
</P>
<P>
The sassy coiffure has no official name (although Vidal Sassoon calls its 
versions Turnstyles). And depending upon how it is slicked back, flipped, 
flopped or tousled, it can conjure images of English schoolboys, the Beatles, 
Joan of Arc, French gamins, Delphine Seyrig in "Last Year in Marienbad" or 
Audrey Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nifty Natural 
</P>
<P>
What makes it a nifty natural for summer and beyond is its softness, ease and 
versatility. It's ideal for busy, time-poor women. And it's the perfect topping 
for athletic bodies, higher hemlines, lower heels, softer shoulders, 
figure-framing silhouettes and the new emphasis on femininity mixed with 
man-tailored classic clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Liberating is the word Palance uses to describe her shorter, sleeker do. 
"There's nothing to hide behind. Your face is what shows." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was guided by Beverly Hills stylist Jose Eber, other women are 
taking their direction from top fashion models, such as Paris-based Linda 
Evangelista, among the first to be photographed with the '60s-inspired cut, and 
celebrities such as Ali MacGraw, whose new, short do caused a stir at this 
year's Academy Awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Eber created the MacGraw cut and notes with relief: "It takes no time at all to 
convince a woman it is feminine and sexy." MacGraw's style has "a boyish feel 
to it, but once you style it, it looks feminine. She wanted something carefree 
because she's very active. She wants to wash and dry it naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about hair now is it's freer and much healthier," Eber adds. "In 
the '70s, we spiked it, we gelled it, we bleached it, we permed it. Hair 
sometimes felt like cardboard. Now it's back to being healthy, shiny and fun." 
</P>
<P>
He finds the fresh, full shape flatters neck and shoulders and solves a problem 
for some clients. "You can create the head shape you want. If someone has a 
flat head, you can cut the hair so it looks rounder." 
</P>
<P>
Stylist Allen Edwards estimates he takes 10 to 15 women each week from long to 
very short hair at his salons, including one in Beverly Hills and two in the 
San Fernando Valley. He thinks some women are influenced by world events as 
much as by fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's subconscious, but with so many negative things in the news, women want to 
do something positive for themselves, something to lift them up." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards likes to add natural-looking color to short cuts. He's partial to dark 
reds and rich auburns. The color should be solid rather than woven through the 
hair, he says. And he advises using a light gel on hair for shine. 
</P>
<P>
On a whim, actress-producer Patricia Carr-Bosley recently decided to get her 
haircut. She says Edwards "picked up his scissors and in about 10 minutes it 
was short. I didn't have time to cry." Her cropped hair is "shorter in back 
than most men wear theirs today and shaggy around the face with a lot of heavy 
bangs." 
</P>
<P>
For variety, Carr-Bosley says she combs it back like a little boy when she gets 
out of the pool or gels it straight back to make it look very European. 
</P>
<P>
She predicts the change will help her career: "This is going to open me up. 
When you have long blond hair, you're really pigeon-holed into the sexy roles 
that I've played." 
</P>
<P>
At Barron's salon in Studio City, owner Barron Matalon says the newly popular 
style reminds him of the '60s, mushroom-shape cut created by Vidal Sassoon. But 
it's much more layered, freer and messier now, notes Matalon, who recently 
turned both Vanessa Vadim (Jane Fonda's daughter) and actress Anne Schedeen 
very short on top. Sometimes he adds spidery tendrils at the sides and at the 
nape of the neck. If a very angular face needs more softness, he adds more 
layering. 
</P>
<P>
He uses color to deepen the outer layers and lighten the inner layers, which 
leaves "the crown really gleaming, and you have a nice definition line around 
the head." 
</P>
<P>
Like Edwards, he prefers red these days. In fact, he believes that red, not 
blond, is the most popular California color. "If you don't have a lively 
looking complexion, red brings it alive," he finds. 
</P>
<P>
Some stylists contend that short hair actually affects a woman's mood. Michael 
Morgan of L'Image salon in West Hollywood notices a change in model 
Evangelista, since she went short. (Her trend-setting cut is by Julien B. of Is 
in Paris.) 
</P>
<P>
"Before, she had a rather stern attitude," Morgan observes. "Beautiful, but 
stern. With this short cut, she has an ingratiating look. It's real. It's 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a similar honesty, Stacey Pickren, an actress who recently switched 
careers, decided to change her image earlier this month: "I didn't want that 
Hollywood-actress look anymore," says Pickren, now a partner in a video 
production company. 
</P>
<P>
She went from "massive hair down to the middle of my back" to what she calls a 
1920s English schoolboy cut, styled by Tom Brophy at Vidal Sassoon in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
She counts six ways she can wear "the texturized tomboy cut," including 
naturally wavy, slicked back, parted on one side with curls falling near one 
cheek or with all her hair blown straight toward her face. 
</P>
<P>
For Pickren, cutting off her hair meant more than keeping up with the latest 
style. "It's a very exposed look," she says. "I'm not hiding behind my hair 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But she cautions: "I think you have to be ready before you can go really short. 
I'm making a conscious career change. I feel very confident these days. I'm 
ready to say, 'This is who I am.' "

HAIR-CARE CHAINS FIND COMPETITION IS RAZOR SHARP

<P>
Supercuts and Fantastic Sam's emerged in the mid-1970s by offering 
no-appointment-needed, moderately priced haircuts. They were an instant success 
with both men and women, filling the void left by the disappearing neighborhood 
barber and beauty shop. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, as competition has intensified for a share of the $24 billion 
Americans spend annually on their hair, the franchised haircut chains have 
turned to increasingly aggressive marketing and new services to attract 
customers and boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
They are redesigning their salons -- abandoning bright colors in favor of 
subtle grays and mauves. Both companies also have begun to offer hair styling 
and conditioning (in addition to the standard haircut), and are selling shampoo 
and conditioning products. 
</P>
<P>
Supercuts even went a step further by hiring Dan Garvey, a nationally 
recognized stylist, to serve as the company's education director. 
</P>
<P>
Most visibly, both companies have hit the airwaves with provocative television 
commercials. The Supercuts commercials feature clips of outrageous hair styles 
and lively music, while spots for Fantastic Sam's suggest that a permanent wave 
may be the perfect cure for a woman's romantic woes. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the changes, especially the new salon decor, seem to have been 
embraced by consumers, two recent marketing gimmicks backfired: 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this year, Fantastic Sam's made a deal with General Mills to place a 
coupon for a free children's haircut on 20 million boxes of Cheerios. When 
children by the bus and carload appeared at salons, many franchisees rebelled, 
refusing to honor the coupons and imposing restrictions on redemption. Many 
complained vehemently to General Mills and Fantastic Sam's that they lost 
thousands of dollars by redeeming the coupons. They also argued that they had 
not been properly informed about the promotion before the boxes hit store 
shelves in April. 
</P>
<P>
* In a less dramatic marketing flop, Supercuts tried to sell discount coupon 
books as Christmas "stocking stuffers" to encourage return visits. When most 
customers said no thanks, Supercuts tried to give them away. Even then, 
franchise owners said few coupons were ever redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
Beauty industry observers are watching the franchised haircut war with 
interest. The amount spent on hair care has been increasing for several 
reasons, according to American Salon's "Green Book," an annual report 
considered the bible of the beauty industry. 
</P>
<P>
As they approach middle age, Baby Boomers are spending more on their 
appearance. The Green Book says people of all ages are spending more on beauty 
services because beauty has been redefined to represent good health. And men, 
who formerly shunned beauty salons, are spending more each year on everything 
from permanents to manicures. In fact, men make up about 65% of Supercuts' 
customers, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
One big reason that the number of franchised beauty salons has increased is 
that virtually anyone can start one and be successful. The financial 
requirements are relatively modest -- usually $5,000 to $25,000 for the 
franchise rights and less than $100,000 for the building and equipment. In 
exchange for fees and royalties, franchisees receive national and regional 
advertising support, training, advice and other support services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hurting Independents 
</P>
<P>
According to the Green Book, there are 8,000 chain-owned salons in the United 
States. New York-based Glemby International leads the list, with 1,515 
company-owned salons located primarily in upscale department stores. Regis 
Corp. of Minnesota operates about 1,400 company salons in malls and department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
On the franchise side, Supercuts has 550 salons and Fantastic Sam's about 
1,325, including those in Canada, Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Hair Performers, based in Illinois, has 300 franchised salons. 
Massachusetts-based Command Performance has about 270 salons. These firms and 
about a dozen smaller companies are in the midst of expanding, according to the 
quarterly Franchise Handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mugnai vice president and publisher of American Salon, the official 
publication of the 48,000-member National Cosmetology Assn., said he expects to 
see more franchising in future years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the franchises are hurting the independents, but not driving them out 
of business," Mugnai said. 
</P>
<P>
He said independent salon owners are responding to pressure from franchised 
salons by expanding the number of services that they offer, hiring better 
stylists and capitalizing on their individual talents and flair to attract 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
While many independents may feel threatened by franchises, one Southland barber 
-- whose shop is next to a Supercuts in a Pasadena shopping center -- said he 
benefits from the millions of dollars that the chain spends on advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring a lot of people to the area," said Rod Otto. But Otto sees the 
traditional one-chair barbershop ultimately going the way of the American 
buffalo. "It will eventually be extinct." 
</P>
<P>
John Lewis, president of Fantastic Sam's, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a great increase in the number of franchised units and a slowing in 
independent businesses," he said. "People want to go into business for 
themselves, but they don't want to reinvent the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
While declining to offer sales figures, Lewis said Fantastic Sam's, founded by 
barber Sam Ross in 1974, is capitalizing on the need for a moderately priced 
haircut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Rules 
</P>
<P>
"We are a Chevrolet," said Lewis. "We are absolutely a middle market company 
offering an excellent quality haircut and other services at a reasonable price 
in a wholesome environment." 
</P>
<P>
Fantastic Sam's does not set the price of services offered by its salons, but 
in the Los Angeles area, a haircut and shampoo are available for about $10. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it has been a very good business for me," said Silvia Anorga, who 
with her husband, Edward, owns Fantastic Sam's outlets in Pico Rivera, 
Montebello and East Los Angeles. "I do wish the company would do more," she 
said. 
</P>

Anorga, who also owns three beauty supply stores, said she chafes under the 
company's strict rules about which products franchisees may use. "We need more 
flexibility because there are only three (brands) we can work with," Anorga 
said.

Barbara Lieberman, who opened her 11th Fantastic Sam's salon in St. Louis this 
week, said she is generally pleased with the support from the company. However, 
Lieberman, who said she has lost thousands of dollars by redeeming the Cheerios 
box coupons, said she is still hoping that the promotion will generate repeat 
business. Gary Grace, who owns 20 Supercuts salons in Hawaii and California and 
is considered the company's most successful franchisee, says stylists enjoy 
working for Supercuts because they don't have to draw their customers, as they 
would in an independent salon. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people from small salons say the person who sat in their chair the most 
was themselves," said Grace, a former franchise consultant. 
</P>
<P>
San Rafael-based Supercuts and Memphis, Tenn.-based Fantastic Sam's take 
totally different approaches in collecting fees from their franchisees. 
Fantastic Sam's charges franchisees a flat fee of about $200 a week, while 
Supercuts' franchise holders pay a 15% royalty on sales. Supercuts says it can 
justify the high royalty because its 550 stores generate twice the sales volume 
of other franchised operations, with about 1.5 million haircuts a month. 
Supercuts charges $8 for a haircut, although about 20% of the salons are 
experimenting with a $9 price, according to Betsy Burton, chairman, chief 
executive and president of Supercuts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits Offered 
</P>
<P>
"We are the volume leader in this business," said Burton, who helped arrange a 
purchase of Supercuts from its founders in 1987 by a group of investors, 
including herself. "We offer (franchisees) the largest return on investment in 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Burton would not disclose the level of that return on investment, but said 
nationwide sales volume is expected to increase to $150 million in 1989 from 
$140 million in 1988. "We intend to double in size in the next five years," 
Burton said. "I think you'll begin to see some consolidation in the industry -- 
the big will get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Burton said one of the most serious problems for the franchises is the dearth 
of new stylists. She said government grants that enabled many cosmetology 
students to go to school have dried up in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
To attract employees, Supercuts, which pays about $5 an hour to beginning 
stylists, offers a variety of benefits, including paid vacations, health 
insurance and educational seminars. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has encouraged franchisees to abandon the old orange and royal 
blue colors and change to a new sophisticated gray and mauve theme. 
</P>
<P>
"Supercuts was on its way out because it was outdated," said Peggy Newkirk, who 
manages several stores for Gary Grace. Years ago, "we had so many customers it 
didn't matter if we kept the old ones," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, as more salons began competing for the moderate-price 
haircut business, Supercuts fell behind. Now, Newkirk said, her stylists have 
been given new tools and much more freedom to create the best look for a 
client. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday morning, eight men were in her salon. Four were in the 
chairs and four more were waiting on a comfortable grape-colored couch. 
</P>
<P>
"I come here because it's the quickest and most convenient," said Mark Empey, a 
26-year-old student at Art Center School of Design. "I've been disappointed 
(with the haircut) a couple of times, but it's not permanent damage -- hair 
grows out."

LOOKS: MY MOTHER, MY SELF-IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HOW A WOMAN FEELS ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKS CAN BE LINKED TO MATERNAL INFLUENCE 
</P>

IF A WOMAN HAS a positive attitude about her looks, chances are that her mother 
did, too. By the same token, psychologists say, if a woman is never satisfied 
with her appearance, her mother probably never was either. Consider Judi Baker, 
whose fashion-model mother taught her to feel confident about her looks. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could make money looking my best, but I also knew that looks weren't 
enough," says Baker, who followed in her mother 's into the field and then 
spent her earnings from modeling and acting to attend college. "My mother 
always had a very practical, conservative attitude. There was nothing unhealthy 
about it; I just learned that it was important to look your best." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, now 40 and owner of a Los Angeles public relations and marketing firm, 
recalls that because her mother always used cosmetics, she grew up fascinated 
with makeup and learned to apply it while in the third grade. Baker's daughter, 
Lauran, a child actress who has just completed her first television commercial, 
already knows how to use makeup, but Baker doesn't allow the 10-year-old to 
wear cosmetics when she isn't working. "My mother stressed good, consistent 
skin care," Baker says, "and I'm teaching Lauran the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Although helping young girls take pride in their appearance is desirable, 
placing too much emphasis on physical beauty can have negative effects on a 
woman's self-image, says Dawne Schoenholz, a Santa Monica-based psychologist 
who studies family relationships. "The mother who is narcissistic and spends a 
disproportionate amount of time grooming gives her daughter a distorted sense 
of value," Schoenholz says. "The young girl begins to believe that the image in 
the mirror is all-important." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenholz cites the case of a mother who wouldn't allow her young daughter to 
sleep on her stomach for fear that the girl would develop wrinkles, a fallacy 
the woman had learned from her own mother. "This kind of pressure teaches a 
child that she can be valuable only if she's beautiful -- the Marilyn Monroe 
syndrome," Schoenholz says. 
</P>
<P>
Cri Cri Solak-Eastin of Pasadena remembers her mother as "the only woman on the 
beach who would wear a French bikini, and she was always paranoid about gaining 
weight." The result, Solak-Eastin says, was that "I felt like a fat, ugly 
duckling. I was resigned to the fact that my mother was always going to be the 
more glamorous one in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Such competitive situations often can lead to a daughter's not caring about the 
way she looks or becoming even more narcissistic than her mother. In 
Solak-Eastin's case, she says, she became "determined to find my own paths to 
excel in." Now 37, a spokeswoman for a diamond-industry trade organization and 
the mother of two young daughters, Solak-Eastin says that her mother "passed 
along the idea that looks make the person. I'm trying to be sure to never send 
that message to my little girls." 
</P>
<P>
Equating self-worth with appearance is a common problem between mothers and 
daughters, explains Allana Cummings Elovson a professor at the California 
School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles. "Even among many of the most 
educated women, the belief is still that beauty is power," says Elovson, who 
studies the link between appearance and women's mental health. "Many girls are 
pressured to believe that being a 'perfect' woman means being beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, a mother who attaches almost no importance to appearance 
also communicates a silent but powerful message. "She is typically a woman with 
low self-esteem," Schoenholz says. "Her daughter not only inherits the poor 
self-esteem but also may place no value on taking care of herself. So she often 
looks as bad as she feels." 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Palisades woman, for example, says that her mother never wore 
cosmetics or went to the hairdresser. "I thought that was absolutely normal 
until I got to high school and saw girls with styled hair and makeup," the 
44-year-old says. "I rebelled and started wearing cosmetics and dyeing my hair 
all through my teens and 20s. But look at me today -- I'm 'the natural look' 
all the way. My mother influenced me more than I ever thought she could." 
</P>
<P>
So what's a mother to do? Emphasize looks? De-emphasize looks? Schoenholz 
suggests finding a balance: "The most important thing a mother can teach her 
daughter is that she is valuable no matter what she looks like, while always 
encouraging her to look the way she feels best."

   The United States has won the backing of
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France for a U.N. resolution
threatening to use ``all necessary means'' to drive Iraq from
Kuwait if it does not leave by January.
   With the agreement Monday among the five permanent Security
Council members, the broad coalition the United States has mustered
against Saddam Hussein crossed a crucial threshold, authorizing the
use of military force.
   There had been speculation the Soviets and Chinese might abstain
on the resolution, which the 15-member council is expected to take
up on Thursday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has traveled the globe for
weeks seeking support from Security Council members for the
use-of-force resolution.

   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) - President Bush, buoyed by a cheering
throng and a fireworks welcome, says Mexico and the United States
are embarking on ``an era more cooperative and more prosperous''
than ever before.
   ``I've come to Mexico tonight with a message of respect, of
admiration and hope for a brighter future shared by our two
countries,'' Bush told tens of thousands packed into Heroes' Plaza
outside the Governor's Palace Monday evening.
   ``Viva Mexico,'' Bush shouted before he and his wife viewed an
elaborate fireworks demonstration from a glassed-in stage on the
plaza.
   Bush was in Mexico on a two-day trip focused primarily on the
two countries' efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Industry analysts say MCA Inc. - the
entertainment giant that gave the world ``E.T.'' and ``Jaws'' - is
so well run that its new Japanese owners will allow creative
control to remain in American hands.
   In the biggest Japanese purchase ever of a U.S. company,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. struck a $6.6 billion deal for
MCA on Monday.
   The Japanese maker of videocasette recorders, televisions and
stereos under such brand names as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar
got a company that produces hit TV shows such as ``Murder, She
Wrote'' and ``Major Dad,'' records artists such as Elton John and
Guns N' Roses and owns many of the biggest movies of all time.
   MCA became the fourth major Hollywood studio to come under
foreign control, raising fears that responsiblity for the financing
and political content of American entertainment is falling
increasingly into non-American hands.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Former regulator Edwin Gray says financier
Charles H. Keating Jr. waged a campaign to discredit him after he
moved to curb risky financial practices at Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association.
   The former Federal Home Loan Bank Board chief told the Senate
Ethics Committee Monday that Keating's campaign followed ``years of
private threats and public vilification'' aimed at easing federal
thrift regulation.
   Gray was resuming testimony today before committee, which is
investigating charges that five senators improperly pressured
regulators to ease scrutiny of Lincoln Savings.
   The Irvine, Calif., institution's $2 billion collapse has been
the most spectacular in the thrift industry.

   LONDON (AP) - Two contenders apparently were neck-and-neck and
the third was hoping to force a runoff in today's voting by
Conservative Party legislators for Britain's next prime minister.
   Treasury chief John Major, 47, the chosen favorite of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine each claimed they were nearing the 187 votes needed for
outright victory as party leader.
   But there were signs that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had
enough support to deny either a majority of the 372 legislators in
the House of Commons, forcing a final ballot on Thursday.
   In a third ballot, lawmakers vote for first and second choices.
If no one wins a majority of the first-choice votes, the
third-placed contender is eliminated and his second-choice votes
are distributed to determine a winner.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - Former President Augusto Pinochet still
is the army commander, but has been losing political ground to
Patricio Aylwin, the elected civilian who succeeded him.
   Even right-wing politicians who supported the 74-year-old
general during his 16{ years of military rule, which ended in
March, are saying he should stay out of politics.
   The annual revision of the armed forces high command this month
gave Aylwin the opportunity for a clear demonstration of his
political authority.
   For the first time since the political coup that brought him to
power in 1973, the makeup of the high command was not determined by
Pinochet alone.

   COLDWATER, Mich. (AP) - The chatter resembles that of any beauty
salon. Women tease each other about their ages and their graying
hair as they sit under hair dryers and flip through timeworn
magazines.
   Posters of the latest hairstyles cover the battered walls, and
the pungent odor of the solution used for permanents fills the air.
   The tools of the beauty trade at the medium-security
Florence-Crane Women's Facility are nothing special, but they're of
some concern. Scissors, electric razors and chemicals can be
dangerous - especially in the hands of convicted criminals.
   Some of these women are locked up for life. Some can receive no
visitors.
   Inmates say the prison beauty shop serves an essential purpose.
In the words of beautician Diane Carter, ``Everyone feels better,
even if they've had a bad day.'' She's serving 20 years on drug and
escape charges.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Fashion: The bronze age sun worshippers take cover - What's
new under the sun? Avril Groom visits Cap Ferrat where the mahogany-tanned
beach bunnies are going the way of the dinosaur and the golden girls are
changing style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTOLLING the virtues of a plain black swimsuit to the women around the pool
at the Hotel Bel-Air in Cap Ferrat is likely to produce plain black looks.
They take glamour in the sun seriously here and they know that, in the
brilliant, bleaching light of the French Riviera, it is bright, or at least
a bold monochrome, that looks right.
Minimalist is not a term recognised in the discreetly indulgent atmosphere
of this cliff-top spot at the tip of one of the Cote d'Azur's wealthiest
peninsulas. And these practised sun goddesses have a point. In their
exuberant swimsuits, fringed pareos, fat Alice bands and jewellery, many of
them look marvellous. As John Betjeman believed, good taste can be ghastly.
On holiday, when fun and glamour are priorities, it can make you invisible.
The one way to ensure that a swimsuit oversteps the line that divides
flamboyance from vulgarity is to wear it with a mahogany suntan. Below the
Bel-Air's pool, in full sun on a windless terrace, the last of the topless
beach bunnies anoint themselves with coconut oil and fry, storing up a
future of health horrors and skin wrinkled like the dinosaurs which, in
fashion terms, they have already become.
Catching the breeze round the pool above are the wiser golden girls who take
refuge under the forest of white parasols that sprout beside each beach
lounger as the sun reaches its full height.
The loose shirts and sarongs that high-glamour swim ranges such as Gottex,
Gideon Oberson and La Perla have long provided as part of their co-ordinated
beach style are worn not just for propriety during lunch but as a matter of
course in the heat of the day.
As many British stores seem to think that autumn arrives at the same time as
the holiday season, finding such co-ordinates can be tricky if you wait, as
many do, until just before your holiday.
Harrods' swimwear department is there all year and has a full range of
Gottex swimsuits and beach separates. Both Fenwick and Harvey Nichols have
recently-arrived stock which has not formed part of their sale. Debenhams'
reasonably-priced (from about Pounds 20) high summer range will last
throughout August, Slix has just introduced its summer range and Issey
Miyake's Splash collection of non-crease holiday pieces is also a new
arrival.
These collections reinforce the pursuit of glamour with nostalgic,
1950s-inspired style - draping, ruching, underwiring, lower leglines and
even skirt effects all play their part.
Fitness-conscious women on holiday take swimming as seriously as sunbathing
and even ruched chiffon is now water-worthy.
The most starrily-clad Bel-Air resident can safely entrust herself to Pierre
Gruneberg, the swimming instructor whose way of teaching the water-shy by
calmly and firmly making them put their heads under water and control their
breathing has made him more famous than his glittering pupils. Women, he
says, hate getting their hair wet but these days they have no excuses:
floral bathing cap and turban are hot fashion items.
Jewellery is also part of the glamour canon and gold is flattering to a
golden skin. Jewellery, like the tan, is toned down this year, to a
substantial but discreet chain or bracelet of the real thing to wear by pool
or beach and a matt gilt costume-jewellery bangle to jangle at lunch. Mappin
and Webb's Spirit of Gold British-designed collection is an interesting
source of well-priced pieces.
A paler shade of bronze may be fashionable but skin needs as much attention
to keep it supple as in the days of darker tans. Apart from suncreams of a
suitable protection factor, generous after-sun moisturising is essential,
preferably an almost perfume-free one such as Decleor's Fraicheur Apres
Soleil. This will blend successfully with the moisturising after-bath
lotions that complement your favourite fragrance, with lighter eau de parfum
most suitable for warm weather. Just launched is the bath range to go with
last summer's successful scent - gardenia, hyacinth and fruit-based-Gio by
Armani.
Hair needs sun protection, too. Colourist Jo Hansford, who has just opened a
London shop, says all hair dries and fades in the sun, with tinted hair
affected most. She suggests a hat. Sun protection screens and conditioners
such as Schwarzkopf's Bonacure range help.
'Bleached hair is already damaged because the pigment has been stripped,'
she says. 'You don't want to exacerbate that effect. We sometimes have to
re-tint highlighted hair that has had too much sun.'
There are other traps which, if taken to extremes, could be disastrous.
'Lemon juice to help the sun lighten hair can turn dark hair orange,' she
says. 'And too much chlorine turns it green.'

<HEADLINE>  OCTOGENARIAN STILL CLEANS UP IN BUSINESS
S.J. DRY CLEANER IS THE WIZARD OF STAIN REMOVAL
TRADITIONAL METHODS THE RULE AT THIS FAMILY-RUN
BUSINESS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Hulbert shows up each day at a job from which he could have retired decades
ago. Instead, he presses on, as they say in the cleaning business.;   By
Hulbert's count, more than 15 million shirts have been washed, dried, pressed,
tagged and shipped out the door of his Diamond Laundry &amp; Cleaners since he
opened it in 1931. That doesn't count the trousers, dresses, suits, vests,
jackets, blankets, draperies, pillows, napkins and tablecloths his San Carlos
Street shop has rejuvenated over the years.;   He has seen every kind of stain
on every kind of material. He has been beaten by a few. He has preserved
wedding dresses, saved family heirlooms and rescued items vital to a child's
security.;   "His real joy right now is stuffed animals," said Mary Hulbert,
Harold's wife of 27 years. "Sometimes a mother will come in with a little
teddy bear and say, 'Can we have it tonight, because he won't go to sleep
without it.' ";   Hulbert will get it done, said Mary Hulbert, who is 69.;  
This is a business run the way businesses used to be run. Harold, Mary and
Mary's son manage the operation, at San Carlos and Delmas Avenue. Harold
Hulbert said it's the last family-owned cleaners in San Jose.;   Harold
Hulbert, a thin man with thinner gray hair and a neatly pressed shirt,
explains that he and his wife have been successful in love and business for
one simple reason:;   "It's just my good nature.";   This makes Mary Hulbert,
a gregarious woman with carrot-colored hair and a perpetual smile, laugh so
hard that she almost falls out of her chair. It turns out Harold Hulbert can
be, or at least act, a little grumpy. A privilege of age, said Sandy Hazzard,
who at three years on the payroll is a newcomer.;   Diamond cleaners doesn't
rely on catchy slogans. About the best Hulbert can muster is: "We don't do any
cheap work," and, "If we can't do it, throw it away.";   There is, of course,
"Miss Careful," a Diamond cleaners mascot of sorts that the Hulberts aren't
quite sure what to do with. An advertising salesman created her years ago,
when Hulbert first listed the business in the Yellow Pages. Now her faceless
figure and the message "Miss Careful Works Here" grace the Diamond cleaners
billboard just outside Hulbert's office.;   "She had a face," Mary Hulbert
explained with a hint of the accent she brought with her from Scotland in
1946. "But now we don't know what to do. Maybe give her a young look, but
she's not so young.";   Not much is young around the Diamond cleaners. The
wall clock that hung at the cleaners' first location now hangs at the
40-year-old San Carlos location. The old building and the stretch of Grant
Street it was on are both buried under Interstate 280.;   A tour of the back
shop conjures up images of a museum exhibit on the Industrial Revolution. The
hissing of the steam presses and the shooshing of the compressors can be
detected a half block away. Dirty laundry is delivered to a back door. It is
subjected to a series of hulking contraptions that line the back room's
concrete floor. There are the gigantic washers, each looking like a space
capsule tipped on its side. The big green roller machine dries, flattens, then
spits out the items. There are the pressing machines with the pull-down tops
-- the kind the Three Stooges constantly got their heads caught in. Finally,
there are the household-variety irons, used by workers to eliminate remaining
wrinkles and press in creases.;   It's the attention to detail, Mary Hulbert
said, that differentiates Diamond cleaners from what she calls "the 99-cent
people." Sure, the modern, mass-production cleaners can beat Diamond's $1.70
charge for a shirt, but they can't beat the Diamond-pressed creases, she
said.;   Harold Hulbert doesn't care what the upstarts charge.;   "I don't
worry about what the competitors do," he said. "I worry about what we need to
operate.";   He didn't learn that in business school. Harold Hulbert was one
of 11 children whose mother brought him up on "whiskey and milk" once his
father died, Mary Hulbert explained. School outlived its usefulness in sixth
grade, so Harold Hulbert went to work -- as a paperboy, then in the press room
at the Santa Rosa Democrat, at a laundry in Oakland, as a projectionist at the
California Theater in San Jose and finally at his own business, which he
started with a $5,000 bank loan in the middle of the Depression.;   It's a job
he would keep for another 60 years if he could. And with Harold Henry Hulbert,
you just never know.  </TEXT>

YOUNG BUSINESSMEN in Tokyo are already flocking to grooming counters for tinted 
foundations and mascara. Men here aren't as adventurous, however -- only 14% 
will even admit to using a moisturizer. Although makeup may not yet get the 
stamp of approval from the average U.S. male, improving his looks does. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, tens of thousands of men turned to cosmetic surgeons to shrink 
potbellies and love handles, lift sagging jowls, add more hair and repair other 
cosmetic problems. In Los Angeles, facialists have reported a 20% increase in 
male clientele over the past year. And cosmetics manufacturers, determined to 
convince men that "good grooming" means more than just a close shave, use 
commercial holidays such as Father's Day to promote new forms of toiletries. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study suggests that their message is getting across. Conducted by 
psychologist Stephen Franzoi at Marquette University, the research indicated 
that 44% of American men say they spend more time each day on grooming than 
their fathers did. Only 13% say they spend less. 
</P>
<P>
Most men cite wives and girlfriends as the major influence on their grooming 
habits. In a focus-group study conducted last year by The Times, eight of the 
12 participants used the same brand-name products as the women in their lives. 
"Women grow up knowing about skin care, so I trust my wife's judgment," one man 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Women also introduce their men to cosmetic services. A Los Angeles banker says 
he watched his wife come home relaxed after her weekly facials. "So I tried it 
and got hooked. But I just don't want anyone to know." Beverly Hills facialist 
Nance Mitchell, who specializes in men's skin care, says men now come in for 
multiple services such as a facial, lash tint, back and shoulder waxing, 
manicure and pedicure -- all in one visit. But privacy is essential. "They feel 
a salon is a woman's world. They don't even like to sit in the waiting room, 
just in case they are recognized," Mitchell says. 
</P>
<P>
Confidentiality is one reason that Guerlain's new Terracotta Pour Homme, a 
virtually undetectable bronzing powder, is registering 30% of its sales via the 
firm's 800 number, says Lois Mander, a spokesperson for the French firm. "It 
allows men to be discreet about their purchases," she notes. 
</P>
<P>
But most men still aren't ready to use makeup-type products. Rather, they 
consider shaving cream, after-shave lotion and, perhaps, a fragrance to be the 
basics. But regimens are expanding. In addition to moisturizers, men are using 
special soaps and facial scrubs formulated to cleanse their skin, which is 
typically thicker and has larger pores than women's. 
</P>
<P>
Many new preparations have specific purposes, such as Clinique's Post-Shave 
Healer for razor burn or Lancome's Anti-Ageing Eye Balm, said to smooth 
crow's-feet. Other products have multiple purposes. Pour Monsieur Protection 
Concentree from Chanel and Tuscany Gel After Shaveby Aramis have moisturizing 
properties as well as scent and the cooling tingle of traditional after-shave 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Franzoi predicts that men's increasing concern with personal appearance will 
continue into the '90s. "Men now realize they can take control over their 
appearance. They never felt that they had that option before." 
</P>

<P>
Photo, COLOR, In June, 98% of men's fragrance and grooming items are bought by 
women for Father's Day gifts, says Marv Adelman, an Aramis vice president. "The 
rest of the year, women still account for at least 50% of sales." Neal Brown

<TEXT>
   Dog owners weary of lugging Bowser into the
bathtub for his Saturday night sudsing are driving to Washington's
new ``dog wash,'' where the customers exit with hair ribbons
instead of a slap on the bumper with a soggy towel.
   At Tri-State K-9 Service, which offers a sort of self-serve car
wash for canines in the southern Maryland suburbs of Washington,
D.C., it's heavy on the shampoo and flea dip and please hold the
wax.
   ``At home, it gets so messy in my bathroom,'' said Jean Burson,
who was grooming her freshly bathed Irish setter, April. ``I was
always drenched, and there was dog hair everywhere, clogging the
drain.
   ``This is not April's favorite thing of the day, but it makes it
a lot easier for me.''
   Tri-State's owner, Craig Jolly, said he opened the dog wash at
his boarding kennel and obedience training school in December for
the convenience of owners who want well-groomed pets without the
fuss of bathing them at home.
   There's no heavy lifting here. Doggie customers climb wooden
ramps that deposit them effortlessly into porcelain bathtubs
equipped with overhead hoses.
   ``I know people who've gotten a bad back from lifting their
150-pound dogs into the bath,'' Jolly says. ``A pregnant woman came
in here recently with a 120-pound Rottweiler, so she sure didn't
want to wash that dog at home.''
   The $9.99 price of the dog wash includes use of shampoos and
dips, brushes, scissors, grooming shears, nail clippers and
shoulder-harness blow dryers for the owners' use, along with
plastic aprons to keep them dry.
   Jolly also supplies spray colognes for pooches with stubborn
body odors, and keeps a glass jar full of brightly colored hair
bows to pin on poodles and other small dogs as they prance out the
door.
   Jolly got the dog wash idea from a trade magazine article about
similar facilities that opened a few years ago in Chicago, then in
California. But when business picks up in the spring, Jolly plans
to add some luxurious touches worthy of a Beverly Hills spaniel spa.
   ``I'm going to get an exercise treadmill,'' he said, ``and a
whirlpool bath for arthritic dogs. And over against that wall, I'll
set up a little dog deli with chewy bones and toys, liver treats,
dog milkshakes and beef rawhides that look like hamburgers and link
sausages.''
   Tri-State's motto is ``Dogs Are Our Only Business,'' but a woman
telephoned recently to inquire whether she could bring in her very
dirty cat for a wash.
   ``I said this is for dogs only and besides, I thought cats
washed themselves,'' said manager Arthur Hamer. ``She said she'd
call me back, and hung up.
   ``Somebody is probably going to bring in a cat or a pet rabbit
someday,'' Jolly said. ``I'll let them use the dog wash if they
want to try.''

FT  25 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Stresses and your tresses - Lucia van der
Post gets to the root of hair repair, finds out what it costs to breathe
clean air and visits a furniture showroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are not too many growth industries around at the moment but stressed
hair seems to be one. JF Lazartigue, the Frenchman who is to hair what Jane
Fonda is to aerobics, has seen his sales worldwide go up by 20 per cent
every year for the last 15 years. Al though in France growth last year fell
to 5 per cent from the 15 to 30 per cent he had become used to it is still
growth. When times are tough women, it seems, still find time and money to
invest in their hair. You probably feel you have more than enough to worry
about and are stressed enough already without fresh troubles but, if JF
Lazartigue is right - and he is in a good position to know - then you had
better start worrying now. 'More and more women are coming into my centres
with thinning hair,' he says. Women, it seems, do such terrible things to
their hair. They perm it and tease it, colour it and twist it. They wash it
with shampoos that are too strong and dry it at high temperatures. The world
around them does not help either - the air is polluted and then they lead
such stressful lives. 'All this,' Lazartigue is convinced, 'shows up in the
hair.' He used to be just a simple hairdresser but soon began to specialise
in 'defrisage' (hair-straightening). Most of the women who wanted their hair
straightened had badly abused hair. 'And,' as he puts it so succinctly, 'you
cannot make a nice hairstyle with poor hair and many of my customers had
very poor hair.' He started to make products to deal with the hair
conditions that kept turning up in his salon. 'Everywhere else there were
average products for average hair. Nowhere could I find specialist products
to deal with special problems.' The first he made out of beef-marrow, a
traditional remedy de grand-mere, which he collected from butchers' shops
all over Paris on Saturdays and boiled up at home in stock-pots on Sundays.
As his product range grew he found the women who came to his salon wanted to
buy the products to take home - in other words, they seemed to feel they
worked.
He had never wanted to sell just potions - he wanted to find a way of making
sure he sold the product that matched the problem.
So the concept of the diagnostic and advisory service developed. Women would
have their hair examined - a few hairs would be plucked out and studied
under the microscope by a qualified analyst. Only then would the right
products be prescribed. The first centre opened on the Champs Elysees in
1975 and from the first day women went there with their hair problems. Today
there are 140 centres in some 40 different countries.
Having your hair analysed can be, I warn you, a depressing experience. When
I dropped into the first ever JF Lazartigue Diagnostic and Advisory hair
centre some three years ago, the news was all bad. Only one of the some 20
hairs that the delightful Odile put under the microscope could be said to be
anywhere near normal. All the others were pronounced no good because the
hair was damaged. Baldness stared me in the face. I crept away with a
fistful of potions in a plastic bag. Odile did not see me back. If there was
any more bad news in the pipeline I did not want to know.
Three years on and, against all the odds still with a full head of hair, I
went along to talk, but only to talk, to Jean-Francois Lazartigue as he
opened yet another of his hair and treatment centres, this time at 204
Sloane Street, London SW1. Nothing was going to get any of my hairs near the
microviewer.
There was the lovely Odile again, hair as lustrously shining as ever and,
wouldn't you know, I hardly had my coat off before my hairs were magnified
80 times on the screen.
Odile and I were quite astonished - 'Look,' she says, pointing to the
magnified root on the screen, 'a beautiful pear-shaped bulb. The shaft is
very healthy, too. Everything is brilliant, you just have a little build-up
of oiliness in the roots.' Ah, the relief. I can put off the visit to the
wig shop.
The roots are, of course, where all the trouble begins. Detergent-based
shampoos and stress combine to make the hair bulb produce squalene, an
acidic ingredient in sebum, which can damage the hair. 'We must catch that
now,' said Odile and wrote me a chart of what to do. I was prescribed a
gentle, non-detergent based shampoo, something to help rebalance the
oiliness in the roots, and a conditioner to give everyday body to the hair.
Once a week, she suggested, I should set aside 20 minutes and give my hair
deep conditioning and restore more life to my highlights.
Does it work? It is hard to say. The products feel and smell good. I like
the idea that I am using non detergent-based shampoos, that the products
have an air of quality to them. If they do cost more than the usual
chemists' range (the cheapest shampoo is Pounds 12, the most expensive
Pounds 19, the colour reflecting conditioners Pounds 16 and the most
expensive product, for urgent rehabilitation is Pounds 28) then I am
prepared to pay the difference. Hair products in most stores and chemist
shops are very broadly targeted. Everything in the Lazartigue range, on the
other hand, has been developed for very specific hair conditions. The acid
test seems to me that customers come back.
There are three diagnostic and advisory centres in this country: 20 James
Street, London W1M 5 HN, 204; Sloane Street, London SW1 9XQ; and the JF
Lazartigue counter at Harrods, Knightsbridge, London SW1. For those who
cannot get to the centres the products are sold in good chemists and by mail
order (a questionnaire accompanies the form) from 20, James Street.

THE RUB IN A HAIR REMEDY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DOES A DRUG THAT BATTLES BALDNESS FULFILL A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN, OR 
HAS IT SIMPLY BECOME THE FOCUS OF A SLICK MARKETING CAMPAIGN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Howard Hintz looks in the mirror every morning, he sees a guy with a full 
head of hair. Maybe it's not quite as thick on top as it was when he was 18, 
but neither is it as thin as it was a few years ago -- and Hintz has a morning 
and evening ritual to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll continue to use it until something else comes along. Or until I get to a 
point where I'm too old to be bothered," said the 31-year-old Los Angeles chef. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to Hintz's rebound from baldness is minoxidil, rubbed in the scalp 
twice a day. Under the brand name Rogaine, the drug has been touted over the 
last year as "the first and only product that's proven to grow hair." 
</P>
<P>
It's a product to meet a health need that is more mental than physical, and 
American men have been slow to accept it. But there has been a slow, steady 
increase of Rogaine users, including some women who were losing their hair 
because of genetics or medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
From its beginnings in sober medical propriety 1 1/2 years ago, Upjohn Co.'s 
marketing campaign for Rogaine has moved from aiming at doctors to directly 
appealing to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
On the sports pages and on posters at the barbershop or hair salon, American 
men are seeing explicit ads about what Rogaine can do for them. 
</P>
<P>
In a twis t on supermarket coupons for cereal and cat food, the ads even 
contain a coupon worth $10 toward the cost of visiting a doctor for a Rogaine 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
And the recent Los Angeles Marathon featured a 5-K run sponsored by Rogaine: 
its first move into sports sponsorship to get name recognition for a cosmetic 
that can be sold by prescription only. 
</P>
<P>
A product that was seen as a sure-fire hit before it received FDA approval in 
August, 1988, Rogaine began looking like a pharmaceutical Edsel in the first 
few months after Upjohn made it available in November of that year. Sales that 
some market analysts had predicted would hit $200 million in the first year 
totaled less than a third of that in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In short, it has taken some work to persuade American men to spend at least 
$600 a year for a vanity product they must use for their lifetimes. Most 
pharmacies fill only a handful of Rogaine prescriptions each month. 
</P>
<P>
One of the notable exceptions is -- where else? -- in the center of Southern 
California's good-looks industry, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Fine Pharmacy, 433 N. Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills, sells at least 144 
bottles of Rogaine every month, said owner Ted Buchalter. He estimates that 10% 
of those bottles go to women. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who don't like to admit they're using Rogaine, "are mostly yuppies, 
young executives, people who are in a position where they have to make the good 
appearance. If they get bald, they look a little older," Buchalter said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at the hair transplant center of the Bosley Medical Group, 8447 
Wilshire Blvd., patients use about 100 bottles of minoxidil a week, said clinic 
administrator Charles Ihling. The drug is thought to promote hair growth that 
the trauma of the transplant operation might temporarily disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Seven other centers in California and three other states bring the Bosley 
Medical Group's monthly consumption to about 1,000 bottles, Ihling said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been told by Upjohn that we're the No. 2 purchaser of Rogaine in 
California and among the top 10 in the United States," Ihling said. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn will not release sales figures, saying only that 2 million men worldwide 
have tried Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
What that doesn't say is how many men quit using the drug because it didn't 
seem to work or because -- once confronted by having to rub it on twice a day, 
forever, and at a cost of about $50 a month -- men decide they'd rather go 
bald. Dr. Rhonda Rand, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, said about half of her 
patients who try Rogaine stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
Minoxidil has been used in the United States since 1980 to lower blood 
pressure. When doctors testing the drug in the early 1970s noticed that some 
men taking the pills started growing hair on their heads and upper cheeks, 
Upjohn began researching it as a baldness remedy. 
</P>
<P>
The tests found the drug useful against male pattern baldness, the hereditary 
type that begins at the top of the head and can eventually leave a man with 
only a horseshoe-shaped fringe of hair around his head. About 30 million 
American men have some degree of male pattern baldness. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that 39% of men experienced moderate to dense hair 
regrowth; 37% had minimal regrowth; 13% grew only small, soft, colorless hair, 
and 11% had no regrowth. 
</P>
<P>
The studies also showed that minoxidil requires a four- to six-month commitment 
of twice-daily applications before early results can be seen. And, although 
early hairs often resemble "peach fuzz," sometimes they are replaced later by 
more normal-appearing hairs. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier in the balding process a man is, the better the results seem to be. 
And, even when hair doesn't become denser, some men find that minoxidil "holds 
the line" against further hair loss. Once minoxidil treatment is stopped, 
though, balding will begin again. 
</P>
<P>
The current formulation is a 2% solution of minoxidil, but Upjohn recently 
launched a study of whether increasing the concentration to 5% would improve 
the results, said Kaye Bennett, spokeswoman for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors also tell their patients to use minoxidil in conjunction with 
Retin A, the "anti-aging" drug. 
</P>
<P>
The major side effect from Rogaine is skin irritation, which occurs in about 5% 
of men. Because minoxidil is absorbed through the skin, close monitoring is 
needed if Rogaine is used by a man with hypertension, coronary heart disease or 
a predisposition to heart failure. Its use should be avoided by pregnant or 
nursing women. 
</P>
<P>
Before Rogaine was approved, American men were spending about $200 million a 
year on various remedies for hair loss, Upjohn says. In January, the FDA banned 
the promotion of various long-standing over-the-counter remedies for baldness, 
calling them ineffective -- and leaving Rogaine as the only approved 
nonsurgical alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Surgical options include transplanting small plugs of hair from the back of the 
head to the top, moving flaps of hair over balding areas, and scalp reduction 
surgery that decreases the bare area. 
</P>
<P>
Although Upjohn and others are researching the mechanism of minoxidil's action, 
no one is sure how it works. Male pattern baldness is known, however, to result 
from hair follicles reacting abnormally to the presence of androgens, male sex 
hormones. 
</P>
<P>
Another drug currently being tested for its hair restoration properties, 
Cyoctol, acts against androgens. A very small study for a Los Angeles firm 
showed that Cyoctol blocked the action of testosterone on the scalp, preserving 
the hair, but further studies are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Women could present the market of the future for Rogaine because they are more 
concerned when hair loss occurs and more likely than men to consult doctors, 
drug market analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It would more than double the market," said Richard Stover, who analyzes the 
drug market for Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Early results of Upjohn tests indicate that hair growth in women with thinning 
hair was 50% better with minoxidil than with a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, women already play an important role in the market, even when they 
aren't using Rogaine themselves, some say. 
</P>
<P>
Many inquiries about the drug come from women who are asking on behalf of 
husbands who are too embarrassed to call attention to their baldness, said 
Dianne Narron, a Raleigh, N.C., hairdresser. Narron chairs an education 
committee for the National Cosmetology Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It tickles me. A lot of mothers whose sons are college-age or older ask about 
Rogaine," Narron said. "One lady noticed her son was getting some hair loss and 
offered to pay for it if he would go to the doctor. She thought he had such a 
wonderful head of hair and, if something could help it, then she wanted him to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn gives hairdressers posters and other information about Rogaine as a way 
to help them advise customers about the drug. 
</P>
<P>
But, even as advertising tries to convince men that their baldness is something 
to treat medically, UCLA health researcher Michael S. Goldstein suggests that 
men's slowness to accept Rogaine is one of the few positive byproducts of men's 
reluctance to consult doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the research on men's health habits tends to make men look bad, 
because they don't respond to (medical) symptoms," Goldstein said. "But hair 
loss isn't a genuine symptom in the way it's commonly thought about. It's a 
created symptom and a need that's being artificially created. So if men aren't 
responding, it's a sign of their mental health, not ill health." 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn's latest effort to woo male customers is a new television commercial 
being tested this month in Youngstown, Ohio; Rochester, N.Y., and New Orleans. 
It is the first time Rogaine's name is being mentioned in a broadcast 
advertisement, said Upjohn spokeswoman Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Previous attempts talked about a new medical remedy for baldness but did not 
name the drug. The new ads talk about Rogaine but aren't specific about what 
it's for. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA requires that if both the name of the product and the condition it 
treats are mentioned, the ad must also contain details about the drug's 
effectiveness and side effects. In print ads, this is solved with masses of 
fine print, but that option is not practical for TV. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate solution to this advertising dilemma -- and a boon for men worried 
about baldness -- would come if the FDA approves making topical minoxidil an 
over-the-counter medication. Market analyst Stover says there is a "high 
probability" of this happening by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, many companies could market anti-baldness minoxidil solutions, 
but Rogaine would have the name recognition that Bayer has for aspirin or 
Tylenol has for acetaminophen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, men will have to consult a doctor before they can obtain Rogaine to 
see if it works for them. Because the results vary from man to man, Howard 
Hintz advises men to come to terms with the idea of being bald before trying 
Rogaine: 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't do something when you're crazed about it, but when you're more 
or less comfortable with going bald. Then if it works, it works, and if it 
doesn't, it doesn't."

<HEAD>Teen-ager Says She Was Turned Away Because of Pink and Purple Hair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beverly Hills teen-ager told a judge
she was barred from Disneyland because her hair was pink and purple.
   ``They don't know what the person's like. It's just not fair,''
Tonya Slobod said Tuesday.
   Superior Court Judge Tully Seymour, after the non-jury trial,
did not immediately rule on her request to find that her civil
rights were violated.
   Miss Slobod wants him to impose a maximum $250 fine under state
civil rights law plus $2,200 in legal fees and unspecified punitive
damages.
   Miss Slobod said she was 14 in 1986 when she was treated to a
trip to the theme park by her grandmother, Gladys Egelko. She said
a security guard stopped her at a turnstile.
   ``He said, `Well, your hair is multicolored and will detract
from our shows,''' Miss Slobod said. She said employees offered to
