   NEW YORK -- If you squint, Robert McKee could almost pass
for Darth Vader. Dressed in black, stocky with dark,
glowering eyebrows, he rumbles into the microphone as 300
rapt students hang on his words. "No, Luke. I am your . . .
{wheeze} . . . father."
   It's the climax of "The Empire Strikes Back," and as
script-writing guru Mr. McKee enacts it, Luke Skywalker has
just learned the true identity of the dread enemy he has been
stalking through two feature-length movies.

<TEXT>
   Socko endings like this -- where the hero comes face to
face with the powerful antagonistic forces arrayed against
him and the plot twists still another time -- well, such
moments are the apex of the screenwriter's art, according to
Mr. McKee.
   "If you can create this most sublime ending of all," he
says, "you too can have a Mercedes and a home in Beverly
Hills."
   It hooks them every time -- in Los Angeles, New York,
Toronto, London and the more than two dozen other cities here
and abroad where Mr. McKee has taken his script-writing
roadshow. For $350 a head, studio executives, performers and
writers (as well as hopefuls) give up a weekend to learn the
lost art of storytelling -- and, by tantalizing implication,
the mysteries of box-office success.
   In his seamless, 30-hour near-monologue, Mr. McKee heaps
disdain upon film-school "auteurs" with their dazzling but
empty camera work. Audiences, he says, hunger for well-told,
classically structured tales, and Hollywood isn't delivering.
As he sniffs the scene: "That's not smog in LA. It's the
stench of all the rotten scripts."
   Movies, he says, are propelled by an "inciting incident"
that pitches the hero's life out of balance and sends him on
a quest to restore that balance. In "Jaws," it was when the
shark ate the swimmer. In "Kramer vs. Kramer," it was Mrs.
Kramer's decision to leave her child with her husband. The
effect on the audience, he suggests, is to provoke the
question "how will this turn out?" and to foreshadow in their
minds the final crisis: when, for example, the sheriff fights
the shark. "Nothing moves forward except through conflict,"
Mr. McKee says. "Conflict is to story as sound is to music."
   By what right does Robert McKee preach story structure to
Kirk Douglas, Diane Keaton and John Cleese? These are some
alums of the course he began as a lark at a Hollywood
experimental school eight years ago and now delivers to 3,000
people annually in North America alone.
   A 50-year-old theatrical actor and director who turned
screenwriter and story analyst in Hollywood, Mr. McKee has
yet to see one of his own scripts on the screen. (Mr. McKee,
whose father made him analyze Aesop's Fables as a childhood
punishment, has written televised episodes of "Quincy" and
"Columbo," and has sold 10 film scripts over the past 10
years, two of which are now in development.)
   Mr. McKee makes no secret of his lack of screen credits;
indeed, he makes use of it in the course. In 1990, he says,
50,000 screenplays were registered with the Writers Guild; he
estimates 250,000 were actually written. Hollywood, after
spending some $500 million annually to option ideas and
scripts, produces 400 to 500 movies -- about one for every 20
optioned.
   To writers who whine that their gems go unbought and
unrecognized, he flings unprintable expletives. "Write a
brilliant original screenplay and Hollywood's doors fly
open," he says. "It's a seller's market." But quality merely
gets you into the race, he warns. If Julia Roberts pulls out,
or if financing falls through -- well, such are the vagaries
of the business.
   Screen credits or no, Mr. McKee has something of a cult
following. Hollywood brass once registered for the course
under pseudonyms, but today it is more often worn as a badge.
Freddie Fields, who produced "Glory," says the course
inspired him to start his first screenplay. Quincy Jones
attended, then bought tickets for people at his production
company. So did Corbin Bernsen of "LA Law." One result, Mr.
Bernsen says, is that writers at his company, Team Cherokee
Entertainment, are now taking more time to craft TV scripts.
And rather than merely pitching ideas around Hollywood, they
"put them in writing," a McKee maxim.
   On a recent weekend, a capacity crowd shuffles into a
windowless auditorium at Hunter College, Mr. McKee's New York
venue. Stand-bys mill around during registration, including
one woman who has driven from Rhode Island in hopes of
filling the seat of a no-show.
   The audience crackles with anticipation; we have heard the
advance word-of-mouth. And Robert McKee has a compelling
story to tell. It's a riveting -- if exhausting -- journey
into the dark night of the human soul and back again --
transcendentally -- at the climax. It's Schopenhauer and
Sophocles as well as Schwarzenegger; metaphysics as much as
mechanics.
   Dogmatic, profane and inspiring by turns, he paces the
weekend like a wellcrafted script: punching up material with
comic subplots, skewering pretention and dropping nuggets of
movie lore (how in "Casablanca," Bogart wore four-inch
platform shoes to dance with Bergman, and how "Here's looking
at you, kid" is dubbed "To your health" in Italian).
   We learn how movie mores evolve with the times, a fact
that scriptwriters ignore at their peril. In "Falling in
Love," the relationship between Robert De Niro and Meryl
Streep was thwarted because they were each married to someone
else. (Mr. McKee yawns pointedly, saying, "The audience
screamed inside: `What is their PROBLEM? Dump the stiffs]'")
   He explains that the female audience's empathy with the
psychopath played by Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction"
surprised the movie's creators, and that she lost that
empathy only after boiling the pet rabbit. "Do anything you
want to a human being," he says, "but {torture} a bunny and
we drop you like a hot rock."
   We are advised to fall in love with our characters --
especially our villains. When the Terminator cuts out his eye
with an X-acto knife and then checks his reflection in the
mirror and smoothes his hair, the terrifying contradiction
grows out of the writer's "love for her Terminator," Mr.
McKee says.
   As we wend our way through text and subtext, the arc of
the scene, conflict, controlling ideas and plot turns, some
bristle at Mr. McKee's curt dismissal of audience
interruptions. "It's Seven Stages of Enlightenment -- No
Questions," mutters one television writer during a break.
   Though a few people creep out during the six-hour,
frame-by-frame structural analysis of "Casablanca" that winds
up the weekend, attrition is otherwise almost nil. And at the
close, after Mr. McKee sings his rendition of "As Time Goes
By," there's a standing ovation.
   "Amazing," says Mike Shatzkin, a writer and book
publishing consultant. "My first reaction when it was over
was, `Well, what else would you like to talk to me about for
three days?'"
   Mr. McKee, whose company, Two Arts Inc., is based in Los
Angeles, does this about two dozen times a year, reaping
enough income from the course and his $2,000 private script
consultations to qualify as a millionaire. But do his
students benefit tangibly as well?
   "There's a tendency to see this in the most cynical light
-- of the sheep coming to be sheared," he says. "I'm no fool
-- I know that of the 300 people here in New York, if one or
two screenplays of excellence grew out of this, it would be a
very successful course. But that's the nature of art -- the
odds are thousands to one against achieving great success."
   In the end, we return to a point he drives home in the
lecture with a scene from "Moulin Rouge." In it,
Toulouse-Lautrec is showing someone the Venus de Milo. It was
dug up by a farmer, and "no one knows who made it," the
artist says. "But it doesn't matter. For he had the pleasure
of doing it."

'THE POOL HALL' TAKES ITS CUE ON A&amp;E CABLE

James Earl Jones, who plays a pool hall owner in "Third and Oak: The Pool
Hall," has a pool table in his suburban home. He piles books on it. But, in
case his 6-year-old son ever wants to learn to play, it's there.
</P>
<P>
"Third and Oak: The Pool Hall," a three-character play by Marsha Norman, will
be shown on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network Thursday (6 p.m. and 10
p.m.) and again next Sunday. It's the first of four hourlong plays by Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwrights to be shown on A&amp;E on the first Thursday of every
month through February as "American Playwrights Theatre," a GM Mark of
Excellence presentation.
</P>
<P>
The play takes place in a run-down pool hall that Jones' character is preparing
to sell. His best friend's son (Mario Van Peebles) stops by and what starts out
as a casual chat turns to more intimate talk of secrets, promises, friendship
and the high cost of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
At first, Jones wasn't sure he wanted to play the character, saying he likes to
portray people who are worthwhile. "That was the problem here. I had to accept
he was a jerk. I'm playing not a villain but not a right guy. I had to readjust
my thinking.
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the blind ones. I defined Troy Maxson in 'Fences' (Jones played
Maxson on Broadway) as a man who didn't distinguish his principles from his
prejudices. This is such a man. He seemed gratuitously racialist if not racist
when it came to references to people outside his race, particularly to the girl
who visits the pool hall. She is blond. She qualifies, in his eyes, for
derision.
</P>
<P>
"I had a problem with that. I don't like to promote gratuitous racialism at
all."
</P>
<P>
"I had to understand that white people had never meant anything good to him. He
can't understand how on a romantic level they can mean something good to a
young man he thinks of essentially as his son. He can't see genuine affection
and love between people who come from different worlds.
</P>
<P>
"My character, who's in a closed society, behaves as if he's a Mafia don. He
expects obedience and the mantle to be passed."
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mario Van Peebles (of the TV series "Sonny Spoon"), the cast
features Debra Cole.
</P>
<P>
The author, Marsha Norman, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for " 'night Mother."
The other playwrights to be represented in the series are Eugene O'Neill, Paul
Zindel and Tennessee Williams.
</P>
<P>
Jones has been around a long time, but he said that doesn't mean good scripts
are going to come "flowing your way in excess. There are more good actors than
good works."
</P>
<P>
But the actor stays busy. He was a poet in the film "Field of Dreams," played
civil-rights leader Vernon Jordan in the first installment of "Saturday Night
With Connie Chung" on CBS and recently narrated "Ivory Wars," about African
elephants, on the Discovery cable channel.
</P>
<P>
He has made several movies, not yet released, since "Field of Dreams." "I have
a 6-year-old. I have to keep working. I don't make multimillions per movie. I
don't think anybody should, frankly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The veteran actor was complimentary about the young crowd of actors coming up.
"The young man who played my son in 'Fences,' Courtney Vance, is in 'Hamburger
Hill.' It's on cable and I've seen it five times to see his scenes. He's a
phenomenal actor. He ranks with young actors like Eric Roberts, Terence Booth,
Alec Baldwin, Kevin Costner. They're strong without being macho bulls. They're
strong as people."
</P>
<P>
Jones next is going to Louisiana to play a man who runs a store in the movie
"Convicts." The wardrobe mistress told him to bring clothes that he wore in
"Matewan," which was about coal miners in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Some moviegoers recognized his voice as Darth Vader in "Star Wars," though the
credits listed the actor inside the costume and helmet. Using his voice was an
afterthought, after the movie was shot, Jones said. "I didn't feel it was
proper for me to take credit. I had been a member of the board of directors of
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences when Mercedes McCambridge's
voice was in Linda Blair's body in 'The Exorcist.'
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to get involved with that sort of thing again. I denied it
during the whole exposure of the first episode. I took credit in the third
('Return of the Jedi') because I was going to be bumped off."
</P>
<P>
When a criticism that black voices shouldn't be used for villains is quoted,
Jones erupts. "That's a racialist point of view, as destructive, limiting and
negative as racism is. I heard a lot of it. That's when black people who need a
platform can't find anything better to talk about. That's embarrassing. There
are a lot of really important issues and they had to light on that to talk
about."
</P>
<P>
Jones, whose training was on stage, mostly acts in movies and TV now. "The
energy factor gets more and more difficult. I'm not happy unless I have a role
that's totally engaging. I commit for more than six months and I get burned
out. If I did a small part I'd be happier, but I wouldn't be able to make a
living from it.
</P>
<P>
"So I will do less stage work, only special things and probably short
engagements. I think my days of commercial theater are probably coming to an
end. I'll go to pasture in movies and TV."
</P>
<P>
But he won't retire. "When we stop doing, we stop being. Most actors can keep
functioning till they can't walk any more."
</P>
<P>
He says with a laugh that he's considering modifying his rich, deep voice for
TV commercials. "I just finished doing the voice of a car. They wanted a kind
of Darth Vader voice. I did enjoy doing those commercials. I will have to look
for another road to do commercials. Maybe some squeaky voice. I don't know."

He can't see shared genuine affection and love between people who
come from different worlds. He can't see she is as desperate as the
young man is and their desperation is very similar. They resolve it
without having a messy affair, as my character had been afraid.
   ``My character, who's in a closed society, behaves as if he's a
Mafia don. He expects obedience and the mantle to be passed.''
   Mario Van Peebles, star of the TV series ``Sonny Spoon,'' and
Debra Cole act with Jones.
   Marsha Norman won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for ``'night

   ``Having been around a long time doesn't mean good scripts are

   When a criticism that black voices shouldn't be used for

   The big guns in electronic fun tried to stake
claims on young hearts Saturday, displaying such gadgets as
portable, hand-held video games and a microphone that lets you
sound like Darth Vader or Mickey Mouse.
   The collection of goodies was at the four-day Consumer
Electronics Show, which runs here through Tuesday.
   The toys aren't just for kids. A number of electronics
manufacturers are marketing telephones that look like bowling pins,
hamburgers and fish _ with your choice of large-mouth bass, chinook
salmon or walleye pike.
   For car buffs, Panasonic representatives are showing systems
that project a map on the windshield to keep drivers eyes on the
road. They also display camera-relayed rear and side vision on a
screen in the dashboard.
   ``You can even see videotapes, like one that shows you how to
change a tire,'' said Pat Griffis, a spokesman for Panasonic.
   A microphone changes voice patterns to any of 16 octaves _
making it easy to mimic film characters including the deep-voiced
Darth Vader or a squeaky Mickey Mouse. The device was developed by
Ohio Art Co., creators of Etch A Sketch, and should be in retail
stores by the Christmas season with a $48 price tag.
   John Weisman, president of Chicago-based ESP Corp., hopes to
cash in on what he calls the ``world's first computer sport.'' The
game, called Battletech Center, is a mix of Disney-like
environmental fantasy and flight simulator technology, he said.
   Players sit in four cockpits, and must act as a team in a
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles.
   ``The desire to be Tom Cruise in Top Gun or Luke Skywalker in
Star Wars, to not have to live that experience vicariously, I think
that's a very common fantasy,'' Weisman said. ``I wanted to create
something that kids think about and use some strategy instead of
just their trigger finger.''
   It took him eight years to develop the game, and he is
negotiating for lease space to open a Battletech Center in Chicago
by the end of the year. Players would pay $6 for a half-hour game.
   ``It got us hooked in two minutes,'' said Brian Bayley as he
stepped out of the cockpit along with colleague Gary Bleckert. The
two show attendees from a St. Louis company, Gusdorf Corp.,
predicted the game would ``definitely catch on.''
   Only retailers, buyers, manufacturers and media representatives
are allowed in the annual show at McCormick Place.
   Among the new items offered by video game giants Nintendo and
Atari are hand-held games that, unlike their predecessors, have
more advanced television-like screens. Nintendo's Game Boy, which
has liquid crystal display, will retail for Christmas at $89.95.
The Atari Advantage, which has a color screen, will sell for $140.
   Nintendo is also offering new for 1989 a Soviet-developed game
called Tetris, which asks a player to build a horizontal line with
a series of uneven lines and shapes.
   The company is spending about $4 million to market the game to
an older crowd, ``from 2 to 92,'' said Bill White, Nintendo
advertising manager.

<TEXT>
   The largest display ever of the
magical creations of filmmaker George Lucas opens Thursday just a
few miles from the movie studio where his fantasies come alive.
   Visitors can see Han Solo, frozen into a block of carbon like a
coffin figure from ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' Luke Skywalker's
Landspeeder from ``Star Wars,'' the Ark of the Covenant from
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and a half-size Jabba the Hutt from
``Return of the Jedi.''
   The five-day show at Marin County's annual fair is free except
for fair admission.
   It has the look of an exhibit of pop culture as much as a
showing of Lucas' galaxy of special effects.
   Explanations are written on cards at each display, but most are
surely recognizable to even the least avid movie-goer. There is
Wicket on his Ewok hang glider, Darth Vader and his Imperial
Shuttle Craft, a stooped Yoda and the Star Wars storm troopers.
   ``We're putting out for the first time on this kind of scale the
very things which dreams and wishes are made of,'' said Judy Niles,
spokeswoman for Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, the
special-effects division of his movie-making empire.
   There also are mockups of Solo's clunker spaceship and Vader's
super-star destroyer; the Imperial At-At, or All Terrain Attack
Transport; the TaunTaun snow lizard; and the Imperial Scout
anti-grav Speeder Bike.
   In one corner of the 15,000-square-foot round auditorium, Vader
stands next to the Deathstar Battle Station.
   Nearby, where they will pose for pictures with guests, stand
C3PO and R2D2, Skywalker's mechanical sidekicks.
   ``This is a collection of giant flashes of imagination, all
inspired by Lucas,'' said Steve Gawley, model shop project
supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic in San Rafael, 15 miles
north of San Francisco.
   ``I think people will come here to try and see how their heroes
were created,'' said Gawley, who has worked for Lucas 13 years.
   Besides Lucas' creations, Industrial Light and Magic also has
created special effects for scores of other hit movies. The Klingon
Bird of Prey from ``Star Trek III'' is displayed, along with a
model of the DeLorean Time Machine from ``Back to the Future.''
   All the movie props were taken from a giant warehouse employees
call The Archive.
   Many were falling apart, and had to be repaired.
   ``These models die a little bit every time you move them,'' said
Niles. ``I doubt that we'll ever again be able to put on a show
this large. Certainly not one that's more than just a few miles
from our studio.''
   The same crew that handles lighting, makeup and costuming for
ILM arranged the display, which includes a star backdrop and videos
showing how the various items appeared on the big screen.
   Models of the spacecraft are startling in detail, not all of it
done in the utmost seriousness.
   Look in the cockpit of one, for example, and you'll see a
miniature Playboy poster, in another a NASA emblem. One has a sea
anchor on the outside of a space destroyer.

<LEADPARA>  "STAR Wars" is coming back.;    George Lucas, creator of the science-fiction
series and director of the original 1977 movie, plans to develop and produce a
second trilogy of films from "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,"
said Lucasfilm Ltd. spokeswoman Lynne Hale, speaking by telephone from company
headquarters in San Rafael.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "George Lucas said he will do the next trilogy of 'Star Wars,' " Hale
said.;    Hale did not specify when the first film would be made, but expected
the three to be completed over the next five to seven years. Analysts project
that a new "Star Wars" movie could be released to theaters by 1997.;    It is
believed to be the first time Lucasfilm has confirmed there would be a new
series of "Star Wars" adventures, although Lucas has hinted as much for some
time.;    Lucas declined an interview request last week.;    While Hale said
"everything at this stage is speculative," the next "Star Wars" trilogy is
believed to be a "prequel" to the original, which would follow the early
adventures of Ben "Obi-Wan" Kenobi, Darth Vader and the child Luke Skywalker.;
   "George Lucas has an idea of what he wants to do but we are not even
pre-production at this stage," Hale said.;    Any news of a "Star Wars" movie
sparks excitement in Hollywood because it represents "the purest opportunity
for a true Hollywood blockbuster," said Paul Bricault, an analyst with Paul
Kagan Associates Inc., a Carmel research firm.;    After all, 1977's "Star
Wars" ($267.4 million), 1980's "The Empire Strikes Back" ($222.6 million) and
1983's "Return of the Jedi" ($252.4 million) form the highest grossing series
of movies in Hollywood history. In total, the movies earned about $1.4 billion
in today's dollars, Bricault said.;    "Star Wars opened up the modern era of
major summer blockbuster pictures," said Bill Immerman, who negotiated the
original Star Wars studio deal for production chief Alan Ladd Jr. "They opened
people's eyes to what kind of business a modern movie could do.";    Hale said
"Star Wars" will wait until after Lucasfilm completes "other projects already
scheduled." Those include television's "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles,"
which went into production May 13. The one-hour series is scheduled to
premiere on ABC in 1992.;    Lucasfilm also has "Red Tails," a movie based on
a World War II unit of black fighter pilots, lined up ahead of the Star Wars
project.;    At the completion of the last "Star Wars" sequel in 1983, Lucas
said the pressure to finish the first three movies was intense because the
actors were aging, the sets were gathering dust and he was paying rent on
facilities.;    At the time, Lucas said he would take a long break from "Star
Wars," if he did not abandon future productions of the science-fiction epic
altogether.;    Hollywood's rumor mill has been in overdrive about "Star Wars"
since Bantam Books released "Star Wars: Heir to the Empire" on May 15. The
book's release prompted speculation that "Heir to the Empire" would serve as a
blueprint for Lucasfilm's next Star Wars blockbuster.;    Written by
science-fiction author Timothy Zahn, "Heir to the Empire" takes place five
years after "Return of the Jedi," taking up after the destruction of the Death
Star and the requited love of Han Solo and Princess Leia.;    "Heir to the
Empire" finds Han and Leia married, governing the fledgling republic and
dealing with threats to peace. Luke Skywalker, meanwhile, is the first in a
new line of Jedi knights.;    Hale was emphatic that "there are no plans at
all to make a movie out of the book.";    She said "Heir to the Empire" is
based only on the "Star Wars" characters, not on the nine stories originally
created by George Lucas -- the basis of all "Star Wars" movies.;    Movie
audiences have seen the fourth, fifth and sixth installments of Lucas' nine
stories, Hale said.;    Zahn's book is an example of the properties and
products "Star Wars" has spawned. Last week, Lucasfilm's game division
announced it will introduce a "Star Wars" video game for Nintendo
Entertainment this year.  </TEXT>

   A dream-traveler ready for intergalactic
adventure climbs into a cockpit and steadies his hands on the
controls. The experience begins.
   Immense robotic creatures lug their massive frames over a rocky
terrain, waging war against the enemy. Every flip of a lever, every
tilt of the control stick fires shrieking deadly lasers,
decapitating other lumbering land giants and splashing metal body
parts over the empty planet.
   It's the latest in video game technology, what creator John
Weisman calls the world's first computer sport. It also is part of
what's new in electronics _ at home and elsewhere.
   ``The desire to be Tom Cruise in Top Gun or Luke Skywalker in
Star Wars, to not have to live that experience vicariously, I think
that's a very common fantasy,'' said Weisman, president of the
Chicago-based ESP Corp., which manufactures the Battletech Center.
   Players sit in four cockpits and must act as a team in a
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles. It took
Weisman eight years to develop the game, and he plans to open the
first Battletech Center along Chicago's downtown lakefront by
March. Adventure-seekers would pay $6 for a half-hour session.
   ``It got us hooked in two minutes,'' said Brian Bayley, 27, of
St. Louis, as he and a colleague stepped out of the cockpit at the
Consumer Electronics Show, where the game made its debut in June.
   Other items for adults on display at the show included
telephones that look like bowling pins, hamburgers or fish _ a
choice of large-mouth bass, chinook salmon or walleye pike.
   For car buffs, Panasonic representatives showed systems that
project a map on the windshield to keep drivers' eyes on the road.
They also displayed camera-relayed rear and side vision on a screen
in the dashboard.
   ``You can even see videotapes, like one that shows you how to
change a tire,'' said Pat Griffis, a spokesman for Panasonic.
   And there were other hi-tech toys. A microphone changes voice
patterns to any of 16 octaves _ making it easy to mimic film
characters, including deep-voiced Darth Vader or squeaky Mickey
Mouse. The device was developed by Ohio Art Co., creators of Etch A
Sketch, and should carry a $48 price tag in retail stores by the
holiday season.
   Among the new items offered by video game giants Nintendo and
Atari are hand-held games that, unlike their predecessors, have
more advanced television-like screens. Nintendo's Game Boy, which
has a liquid crystal display, will retail at $89.95 this winter.
The Atari Advantage, which has a color screen, will sell for $140.
   Nintendo now also offers a Soviet-developed game called Tetris,
which asks a player to build a horizontal line with a series of
uneven lines and shapes.
   The company is spending about $4 million to market the game,
said Bill White, Nintendo advertising manager.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Film empire strikes back - Games are feeling
the force of Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Any Star Wars buffs who ever dreamt of fighting the Rebel Alliance by flying
an Imperial starfighter under Darth Vader's command can now act out their
fantasies by buying TIE Fighter, one of the dozens of new computer games on
sale this Christmas.
TIE Fighter is the latest launch from Lucas Arts, the games subsidiary
created in the early 1980s by George Lucas, director of Star Wars, at his
state-of-the-art entertainment laboratory at San Rafael, California.
Mr Lucas, who dropped out of the Hollywood mainstream over a decade ago to
pursue his passion for technology, was a pioneer of the use of movie themes
and characters in games. His Star Wars games often feature at the top of the
computer games charts and the Hollywood studios are now racing to follow
Lucas Arts into the games sphere. Time Warner earlier this year acquired
Renegade, a games software house. New Line, the film company owned by Ted
Turner, the new-media mogul, recently formed a Dollars 30m (Pounds 18m)
joint venture with France's Havas to develop a global games business. Even
record companies are muscling into the market. Motown, the music label owned
by PolyGram, recently launched a Motown Games subsidiary.
The next convert to the games sphere is mooted to be Walt Disney, which is
expected this week to announce plans for the formation of a new interactive
entertainment division. Disney, like other studios, presently licenses its
characters for use in games devised by other companies such as Sega and
Nintendo, the Japanese games specialists.
The catalyst for Hollywood's sudden surge of interest in computer games is
the emergence of the new generation of disc-based games. The games market
has since the early 1980s been dominated by the 16-bit cartridge consoles
made by Sega and Nintendo.
For the past year or so the market has been moving towards disc-based games
played on home computers and multimedia machines that are able to play
CD-Roms, or interactive discs. Lucas Arts and other companies have already
made the most of the enhanced qualities of disc medium to create more
sophisticated games. They will be able to reach new levels of sophistication
with the next wave of change - the launch of the 32-bit and 64-bit
disc-based games, that are now being introduced in Japan and will come out
next year in the US and Europe.
These games are much more powerful than the old 16-bit cartridge consoles.
They have the capacity to create cinematic sounds and images that are
perfect vehicles for the characters and plots of Hollywood movies.
'There's no doubt that CD-Roms and the new games formats could become a
phenomenal growth market,' says Michael Lynne, president of New Line in New
York. 'All the attributes of a motion picture will soon be available on a
computer screen, so we can apply our skills to create games and informative
'edutainment' products.' New Line, like the other studios, plans to become
more aggressive at adapting its movie concepts into games. However, Randy
Komisar, president of Lucas Arts, suspects that Hollywood may have
underestimated the complexity of the games market.
'There is scope to use the techniques of movie-making in a game - we do it
all the time,' he says. 'But film is a linear medium and a game is a virtual
experience. If you take the content of a movie to use in a game, it must be
developed so that it is exciting and engaging in an interactive context.'

The force was definitely with John Williams and George Lucas this week.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years after film maker Lucas first pitted Luke Skywalker, Princess
Leia and Han Solo against Darth Vader, he invited his favorite movie composer
to his sumptuous 3,000-acre Skywalker Ranch in the rolling hills of Marin
County for a two-day "Star Wars" taping session.
</P>
<P>
Williams, about to enter his 11th year as conductor of the Boston Pops, briskly
and congenially led a hand-picked ensemble of 95 Northern California musicians
through the recording of 13 selections from the blockbuster film trilogy.
</P>
<P>
The resulting compact disc, the first digital recording of "Star Wars" tracks,
is scheduled to be released by Sony Classical Productions this fall.
</P>
<P>
For Williams, 58, less press-shy than the reclusive Lucas, the project is
particularly poignant. The original "Star Wars" sound track, recorded in 1977
at the defunct Denham Studios' Anvil scoring stage near London, won the
composer one of his four Oscars.
</P>
<P>
According to Williams, it was when Lucas learned that the British studio would
be torn down that he got the idea to build his own world-class facility, over
the objections of underlings who deemed it too ambitious and expensive.
</P>
<P>
Untold millions of dollars later, Williams and the Skywalker Symphony, as the
collection of free-lance musicians is called, reaped the benefits Monday and
Tuesday as the sounds of "Princess Leia's Theme" and other melodies
reverberated through the 30-foot-high room.
</P>
<P>
"It's a treat to see George's dream be realized," Williams said during a lunch
break, pointing out the state-of-the-art "mixing" console and the studio's
undulating mauve walls and ceiling, where panels can be shifted to change the
acoustics.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the gaggle of performers, engineers and production people imported for
the session agreed that Lucas, a legendary big thinker, and the studio's
designer, Tomlinson Holman (also the developer of the THX "The Audience Is
Listening" movie-theater sound system), had outdone themselves.
</P>
<P>
"This is no doubt one of the finest studios in the world," said Mark Genfan, an
engineer with Sony Classical Productions in New York. Even so, Sony brought in
its own sophisticated recording equipment, including a machine that records 48
separate tracks on a half-inch tape.
</P>
<P>
At midday, producer Thomas Z. Shepard said with a disappointed sigh that the
project would wrap up by late afternoon, absolutely on schedule and too
speedily to suit him.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay here a month," said Shepard, who flew in from New York and
was one of the lucky ones staying on the premises. "I've never yearned for
inefficiency so much."
</P>
<P>
Skywalker Ranch, headquarters of Lucasfilm Ltd., covers nearly 3,000 of Lucas'
4,700 bucolic acres, of which 95% has been permanently dedicated to open space.
</P>
<P>
The main offices are in what appears to be a large white Victorian mansion,
with big front porch, gingerbread trim, leaded glass doors and redwood
paneling. Although the place looks fit for a king, no one lives full-time on
the ranch. But during the day, the ranch is home to about 150 employees who
work in post-production, licensing and other of Lucas' busy divisions.
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old recording studio -- which has been used by such diverse
performers as Bobby McFerrin, Huey Lewis &amp; the News, the Grateful Dead and
the American Baroque Ensemble -- is housed down the road in the brick and wood
Tech Building. It was built to look like a winery, complete with fledgling
vineyard, and faces an artificial lake where ducks and egrets splash. Lucas
installed the lake for fire protection; the ranch has its own firefighting
squad and two shiny red firetrucks.
</P>
<P>
Lucas has scattered throughout the buildings an impressive collection of French
movie posters, paintings by such artists as Norman Rockwell and Maxfield
Parrish and memorabilia from his movies, including a model of Yoda, the wise
Jedi master who taught Luke Skywalker how to use "the force" to advantage.
</P>
<P>
The "Star Wars" taping was a reunion for the Skywalker Symphony, which was
first assembled from various Bay Area groups for Linda Ronstadt's Grammy
Award-winning album "Cry Like a Rainstorm -- Howl Like the Wind."
</P>
<P>
Williams, who lives with his wife, Samantha, in Westwood when he is not touring
with the Boston Pops, said he was impressed with the orchestra's skill. "We're
rehearsing on the spot," said the composer, dressed casually in black pullover,
gray slacks and running shoes. "It's going very well."
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi,"
Williams and Lucas have worked together on the "Indiana Jones" trilogy directed
by Steven Spielberg, another longtime Williams associate ("Jaws," "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T.").
</P>
<P>
Lucas was executive producer of last year's "Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade," for which Williams' music has been nominated for an Oscar. (The
prolific Williams, who spends about three months on each score, is also up for
an Academy Award Monday for "Born on the Fourth of July.")

<LEADPARA>  VINCENT Hammond, the latest monster from Dr. Frankenstein's lab, is facing
heavy odds if he hopes to build a lasting screen career out of his role in
Monday night's Fox network movie, "Frankenstein: The College Years.";   Dozens
of actors have played the monsters of Frankenstein since Charles Ogle, a
member of Thomas Edison's acting stock company, was picked to play the first
of them in a 1910 silent version of "Frankenstein," a film that no longer
exists.  </LEADPARA>

ONE ACTOR'S CAREER WAS 'MADE' BY THE MONSTER:
BORIS KARLOFF. HIS NAME IS STILL A SYNONYM FOR
HORROR.
MORE THAN 80 YEARS LATER, A GREAT MAN-MADE VILLAIN
STILL STALKS OUR NIGHTMARES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; See also related article on page 17 of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Few careers were enhanced by the role, including Ogle's. Though he can be
seen in a supporting part in at least one silent classic, "The Covered Wagon"
(1924), he is little remembered today.;   Some others who played monsters
created by Dr. Frankenstein without causing any noticeable stir: Percy Darrell
Standing ("Life Without Soul," 1915); Michael Gwynn ("The Revenge of
Frankenstein," 1958); Sally Todd ("Frankenstein's Daughter," 1958); Kiwi
Kingston ("The Evil of Frankenstein," 1964); John Bloom ("Dracula vs.
Frankenstein," 1971) and Nick Brimble ("Frankenstein Unbound," 1990).;   Only
one actor's career was truly "made" by playing the monster: Boris Karloff. His
name is still a synonym for horror and his flat-headed, bolt-necked look in
the 1931 "Frankenstein" -- created by makeup artist Jack Pierce -- remains the
prevailing image of the monster after 60 years of sequels, remakes, rip-offs,
sendups and even children's cartoons.;   Though Karloff was in 78 films before
"Frankenstein," he hadn't played a leading role on screen. His name had so
little value in 1931 that he was billed simply as "?" in the opening credits
of "Frankenstein." The role not only made the 44-year-old Karloff a
full-fledged movie star, but also launched him on a lucrative new career as a
horror actor that lasted the rest of his life.;   As Karloff told this
reporter 30 years ago, "I'm eternally grateful to the monster" for the career
he made possible, "but I'm sad to see what's become of him.";   Karloff was
talking about the Grand Guignol trend of the late 1950s, in which
Frankenstein's monster had been turned into either a shambling murder machine
with little personality or a stooge for such comedians as Bud Abbott and Lou
Costello.;   In the years since Karloff's remarks, the movies have given us a
handsome, articulate monster (Michael Sarrazin in "Frankenstein: The True
Story"), a black monster (Joe DiSue in "Blackenstein"), a number of female
monsters (Susan Denberg in "Frankenstein Created Woman," Jennifer Beals in
"The Bride," Patty Mullen in "Frankenhooker"), a cowboy monster (Cal Bolder in
"Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter"), even a sexually ambiguous
monster (Joe Dallesandro in "Andy Warhol's Frankenstein").;   But few have had
the distinct personality Karloff gave his monster in "Frankenstein" and two
sequels. His monster learned to talk, enjoy music and even smoke cigars before
turning really mean-spirited. That chance to act beneath the makeup may be why
Karloff's monster is so well remembered after so long.;   HERE'S a close-up
look at some of the notorious monsters of Dr. Frankenstein and the people who
played them:;   BORIS KARLOFF: The veteran screen heavy landed the part of the
monster in Universal's classic 1931 "Frankenstein" by default. "Frankenstein"
was originally envisioned as a vehicle for Bela Lugosi, who had just finished
"Dracula" for the studio, but Lugosi turned it down because the monster had no
dialogue.;   Director James Whale tested several actors before settling on
Karloff, who portrayed the monster like a puzzled newborn child trapped in a
grotesque body. His violence was provoked more by the torment he received from
Dr. Frankenstein's vicious assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), than from the
"criminal brain" mistakenly implanted in his skull by Dr. Frankenstein (Colin
Clive).;   Karloff played the monster only twice more on the big screen: "The
Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) and "The Son of Frankenstein" (1939), in which
he was jump-started by Dr. Frankenstein's son, Wolf (Basil Rathbone). He
played a mad scientist who revived the monster in "The House of Frankenstein"
(1944) and a descendant of Dr. Frankenstein in a 1958 cheapie, "Frankenstein
1970." (His monster was played by Mike Lane, best known as the boxer in "The
Harder They Fall.") Karloff put the monster makeup on one last time for a 1962
episode of TV's "Route 66." He died in 1969.;   ELSA LANCHESTER: While her
Oscar-winning husband, Charles Laughton, was playing Captain Bligh in "Mutiny
on the Bounty," Lanchester was playing the female monster created by Dr.
Frankenstein (Colin Clive) as a mate for Karloff's creature in "The Bride of
Frankenstein" (1935). Her electroshock hairstyle and birdlike screeches of
horror at learning she was intended for the gruesome Karloff made Lanchester's
monster the best among Dr. Frankenstein's experiments with women. Her later
work tended mostly to comedy. She died in 1986.;   LON CHANEY JR.: Creighton
Tull Chaney, the tall, muscular son of the silent screen's greatest horror
actor, reluctantly took his father's name shortly after he broke into pictures
in 1932 as a rough and ready action player in "B" movies and serials. He moved
up to star status after playing Lenny in John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" on
stage and screen.;   By 1941, Chaney began to make horror movies at Universal,
the same studio where his father played "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame." Best known for creating the role of "The Wolf Man"
(1941), Chaney then played Frankenstein's monster in the first post-Karloff
picture in the series, "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942).;   In that film,
the monster was revived by Dr. Frankenstein's other son, Ludwig (Cedric
Hardwicke), given the brain of deformed killer Ygor (Lugosi) and went blind in
the final reel. His performance was not widely praised. Chaney reprised the
role in 1952 for TV's "Tales of Tomorrow" series. He later became a character
actor in films like "High Noon" and "The Defiant Ones," but also continued to
star in ever cheaper horror pictures. He died in 1973.;   BELA LUGOSI: By
1943, when "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" was released, Lugosi was 61, his
once promising career had faded and he was hurting for money to support a
growing drug habit.;   Lugosi finally kicked his drug habit in the early
1950s, but was a physical wreck when he finally died in 1956 at age 74 during
the filming of perhaps his worst of many bad movies, "Plan 9 From Outer
Space." (His part was finished by a double.) Though his Frankenstein monster
was a disaster, he remains the screen's most memorable Dracula.;   GLENN
STRANGE: The huge actor was mainly a bit player in westerns when Universal
picked him to play Frankenstein's monster in "The House of Frankenstein"
(1944), first of the "all-star" monster movies. His monster was revived by mad
scientist Boris Karloff, who also resurrected Dracula (John Carradine) and
tried to find a cure for the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.) before revving up Dr.
Frankenstein's equipment with the help of a hunchback (J. Carrol Naish).;
Strange played the monster in two more films -- "House of Dracula" (1945) and
"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948) -- then toured the country as
Frankenstein's monster in live shows before finally finding the role he's
remembered best for today: Sam the Bartender on TV's "Gunsmoke," which he
played from 1956 until his death in 1973.;   CHRISTOPHER LEE: The imposing
English actor attracted little attention in films before he was cast as the
monster in "The Curse of Frankenstein" (1957), first in a long series of
horror movie remakes by England's Hammer studios. His grotesque, putty-faced
monster played second fiddle to Dr. Frankenstein (Peter Cushing), who returned
in a series of sequels with different monsters each time.;   Lee soared to
stardom the following year in "The Horror of Dracula" (1958), playing the
bloodthirsty count in his own series of sequels. Lee and Cushing became the
Karloff and Lugosi team of the 1960s. Lee continues to play grotesques, but
soon will be seen as Sherlock Holmes in a syndicated television special.;
FRED GWYNNE: The 6-foot-5-inch theater-trained actor became a star in the TV
sitcom "Car 54, Where Are You?" in 1961, but is best remembered as Herman
Munster, one of Dr. Frankenstein's bigger mistakes, in the 1964-66 TV comedy
series "The Munsters." Revived in the 1980s with a new cast -- John Schuck is
the new Herman -- "The Munsters Today" continues in TV syndication. Gwynne has
played dozens of other roles in movies from "On the Waterfront" through "Pet
Sematary," but never has shaken the Munster image.;   DAVID PROWSE: The
towering Prowse made no waves as the monster in "The Horror of Frankenstein"
(1970), but became a favorite of kids everywhere a few years later as the even
more sinister Darth Vader in "Star Wars" (1977) and its two phenomenally
successful sequels.;   MICHAEL SARRAZIN: Surely the most handsome of all the
monsters, Canadian actor Sarrazin is mostly remembered for romantic roles in
films of the 1970s. But anyone who saw NBC's "Frankenstein: The True Story"
(1973) won't be able to forget Sarrazin as the suave, stylish monster of Dr.
Frankenstein (Leonard Whiting), who was utterly charming -- until he turned
violent and ripped a woman's head off. The role didn't affect the actor's
career much, but he has slipped out of view lately.;   BO SVENSON: Before he
became a leading man in action pictures such as the "Walking Tall" films,
Svenson walked even taller as Frankenstein's monster in a two-part 1973 TV
version of "Frankenstein" from producer Dan Curtis ("Dark Shadows"). His
monster was created by Dr. Frankenstein (Robert Foxworth) and given a bride
(Rosella Olson), but few memorable reviews. Svenson no longer plays leads.;
PETER BOYLE: The bulky, balding Boyle became a star in the dramatic "Joe"
(1970), but proved he could play comedy in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein"
(1974), the best "Frankenstein" movie parody. Boyle remains one of our best
character actors.;   DAVID WARNER: The veteran British actor has played
abnormal characters from his early days in films like "Morgan!" (1966), "The
Omen" (1976) and "Time After Time" (1979), so it was no surprise to find him
playing the monster in "Frankenstein," a 1984 TV production that co-starred
Robert Powell, the same actor who played Christ in TV's "Jesus of Nazareth,"
as Dr. Frankenstein. (box)  </TEXT>

Laughs in Space From Brooks and Spielberg
---
By Julie Salamon</HL>
<DD> 07/02/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Mel Brooks's "Spaceballs" has the kind of icky adolescent humor you might expect from the man who staged the group flatulence scene in "Blazing Saddles" -- snot jokes, that sort of thing.
And who, besides the manic Mr. Brooks, would imagine that outer space might as well be in the Catskills, that the "Star Wars" trilogy could be recast as one long Jewish joke?

   But who else has made a career out of satirizing the various film genres: westerns ("Blazing Saddles"), horror ("Young Frankenstein"), suspense ("High Anxiety"), et cetera?
Then again, "satire" doesn't really describe what Mr. Brooks does, the way he gobbles up the ingredients for each type of picture, then belches out his own vulgar -- and often hilarious -- version.

   So, you might be wondering, is "Spaceballs" funny? (And, you might be wondering, why so many questions?
But after sitting through a couple of hours of Brooks burlesque, it's hard not to fall into the Yiddishe habit of answering questions with questions, isn't it?)

   "Spaceballs" is extremely funny -- buoyantly tasteless (Mr. Brooks has created a new standard for Jewish American Princess jokes) and also smart about the cynicism of the movie business.
Long before the movie is finished we're hearing about "Spaceballs, the T-shirt," and "Spaceballs, the placemat."
We aren't talking "Network" here, mind you, but a lighter, sillier, dopey summer picture kind of parody.

   Like all the best Brooks movies, this one moves forward in fits and starts, and most of the starts are hyperkinetic.
In some ways "Spaceballs" is like the enactment of a standup comedy routine; many of the best jokes are really commentaries on the jokes that preceded them.

   The best part about a top-form Brooks movie -- which "Spaceballs" is -- is the way it rises to the weirdness of real life.
At one point during "Spaceballs" the Darth Vader character -- here called Dark Helmet -- pops the videocassette of "Spaceballs" into his VCR so he can remember what's happened so far.
The scene reminded me of a wedding I went to recently where, halfway through the party, people began clustering around a TV set where they could watch the first half of the wedding, the wedding they were still celebrating.

   Mr. Brooks has some fun mimicking the "Star Wars" hardware (with an assist from George Lucas's Industrial Light &amp; Magic division) -- and its oddball cast of intergalactic characters.
John Candy, who plays a half-man, half-dog space adventurer called "Barf," does an amusing update on the Cowardly Lion in "The Wizard of Oz."
Most of the casting is terrific, especially Daphne Zuniga as the Druish princess and Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet; his rubbery comic's face works wonders.
Mr. Brooks appears in two roles; the one you'll remember is Yogurt, the ancient seer who distributes his sagesse in fortune cookies.

   Joan Rivers provides the voice of a robot lady-in-waiting.
Her lines are disappointingly dull but there's great pleasure in hearing that voice come out of a shapely, skinny body that looks as though it's been dipped in gold lame from head to toe.

   ---
   "Innerspace" is the most recent attraction in Steven Spielberg's movie amusement park and it does what it's meant to do.
Almost before the ride begins you know where it's going to end, but there's enough ingenious hocus-pocus along the way to leave you feeling pleasantly lightheaded.

   Having run out of variants on outer space and alien creatures, producer Spielberg and director Joe Dante ("Gremlins," "Explorers") decided to try a "Fantastic Voyage" update with state-of-the-art special effects. (You may remember "Fantastic Voyage," the camp '60s sci-fi trip inside a human body.
The most effective special effect was Raquel Welch.)

   Here, the story has to do with Silicon Valley espionage.
One group of scientists has figured out how to "miniaturize" people and spaceships; another group wants to steal the formula.
There's a bit of introductory huffing and puffing until the film makers manage to do what they want to do: shrink one of their heroes until he's almost molecular, and accidentally implant him into a man, not a laboratory rabbit.
Because this kind of movie requires a ticking clock, the good guys have 24 hours to recover an "enlargement chip" or the fellow on the inside will die.

   Dennis Quaid, who was so wonderful as Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper in "The Right Stuff," is appealing as Tuck, a disillusioned flyboy.
It is Tuck who volunteers for shrinkage, and who sails around someone else's innards in a fully equipped spacecraft.

   He ends up inside Jack (Martin Short), a meek grocery clerk and hypochondriac.
Mr. Short, known best for his work on SCTV Comedy Network and "Saturday Night Live," has a slightly unconscious gentility that can be very funny.
After he grows used to the idea of Tuck whizzing around his circulatory system, he says dreamily: "You're seeing parts of my body I'll never get to see."
You can tell this is a man who fantasizes about his blood-cell count.

   But he likely wouldn't come up with the pulsating, throbbing world the film makers have concocted inside him.
"Innerspace" is all gimmickry, but the gimmicks -- and the performers -- are inventive and amusing.

<HEAD>`Starmites,' A New Musical, Opens On Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 5 grafs with what other critics said</HEAD>

   Pow! Bam! Zap! Thud!
   So goes ``Starmites,'' the futuristic comic book musical that
arrived Thursday at Broadway's Criterion Center.
   The show purports to be a salute to the fabled sci-fi
superheroes of DC and Marvel comics. Instead, it trashes them,
trampling on their sense of fun, style and most of all, adventure.
   Don't look for the exuberance George Lucas captured on film more
than a decade ago in ``Star Wars,'' or the innocent dumb fun of the
mid-1950s ``Superman'' television series starring George Reeves.
They are missing here.
   Barry Keating, who wrote the music and lyrics for ``Starmites,''
and Stuart Ross who, along with Keating, concocted the book, can't
settle on the right tone for their meager story. It vacillates
between high camp and sappy, juvenile comedy.
   The tale concerns a young girl, Eleanor, who lives in her own
fantasy world of comic books. She's pulled into Inner Space,
Earth's parallel dimension, and a meeting with the Starmites who
are sort of an intergalactic version of the Guardian Angels.
   These good guys are led by Spacepunk, played by Brian Lane Green
who bears an uncanny resemblance to ``Star Wars'' hero Harrison
Ford. Green acts with the same breezy and appealing nonchalance and
has a good voice, too.
   Eleanor is played by Liz Larsen whose show business savvy and
brash, belting style of selling a song are at odds with her
supposedly waif-like character.
   They end up meeting Trinkulus, a lizard-like creature who sings
what sounds like off-key, soft-rock madrigals, and Diva, the tough,
brassy leader of the Banshees. As played by Sharon McNight, Diva
resembles the late drag artist Divine, only her crew cut is a
little more punkish. Miss McNight certainly can put over a number.
Her ``Hard to Be Diva'' pretty much stops the show, although it
wasn't going much of anywhere.
   The villain of the piece, a steel-plated warrior called Shak
Graa, looks like a tin-can version of Darth Vader and sounds like
the Phantom of the Opera with a head cold.
   The minimal plot includes a feeble love triangle involving
Spacepunk, Eleanor and Diva's daughter, Bizarbara, also played by
Miss Larsen. You may not care who wins out, but true love does
triumph in the end.
   At least director Larry Carpenter gets the actors through the
dialogue quickly and choreographer Michele Assaf has experly
drilled the cast. But it's hard to judge their expertise when they
are forced to jump around on stage to something called ``The Dance
of Spousal Arousal.''
   The production's special effects are negligible. Set designer
Lowell Detweiler has provided a nice backdrop of twinkly stars but
the rest of his designs, including a giant bird that unfolds its
wings to reveal a throne, are suprisingly tacky.
   The costumes are worse, especially for the women. Diva and her
quartet of leather-clad ladies-in-waiting are dressed by designer
Susan Hirschfeld to look like extras out of ``Ilsa, the She-Wolf of
the SS.''
   Keating's score slips from memory as soon as it's heard. It's
cartoonish in the worst sense, crude and obvious. The music and
lyrics have none of the wit and sophistication that Charles Strouse
and Lee Adams displayed in ``It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's
Superman!'' (one of the theater's most unjustly neglected scores),
or the Broadway professionalism that Strouse and Martin Charnin
managed to pack into ``Annie.''
   ``Starmites'' is the first production at the Criterion Center
Stage Right, one part of a new theater complex in Times Square. Its
other theater, a cabaret space, housed ``Suds,'' a lamentable
celebration of Golden Oldies, last fall. What ``Suds'' did to those
hits of the 1950s and '60s, ``Starmites'' does to the comics.
Where's ``Little Lulu'' now that we really need her?
   What other critics said:
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post wrote, ``The trouble with it _
even before the music and lyrics _ is the idea. It is a foolish
idea for a musical. And nothing in the theater can redeem folly
except a circus. And this is no circus.''
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News said, ``In the last few years a
whole new genre has emerged, musicals that have no intrinsic merit
but are suitable for leaving the kids while you go shopping.
   ``In this genre, you have `Cats,' `Starlight Express' and now
`Starmites.' In this genre, you don't judge a musical by its
content but rather by its visuals. Will they live up to the
expectations of kids suckled on MTV? Here `Starmites' is a sort of
trailblazer. ... the style of the show is Tacky High-Tech, surely a
new category with loads of potential.''
   Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote, ``To its credit,
`Starmites' never takes itself too seriously and is always tongue
in cheek. It remains a light-hearted space flight.''

   Environmentalism Gone Amok

<LP>
   If you're like me, you're glad that environmentalism has
become chic. All those gala champagne soirees for the
protection of the rain forest have definitely raised my
consciousness. But who'd have guessed that ecology would
suddenly get so hot they'd inflict it on us as a weekly
dramatic action series?
   "What in hell are we doing here?]" shouts a voice over an
image of the globe. Cut to a man on top of a factory
smokestack, screaming through a megaphone, "We're murdering
the planet] We're poisoning the atmosphere] We're killing the
skies] . . . It's got to stop]]" Then he unfurls a banner
that proclaims "Recycle" and flings himself off the
smokestack.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So begins "E.A.R.T.H. Force" (CBS, Saturdays, 9 p.m. EDT),
a show whose heart is certainly in the right place, but whose
mind is somewhere else altogether. Here's the basic premise:
A fiendish villain infiltrates a nuclear plant to steal
plutonium, and sabotages the cooling system. Meltdown is 36
hours away. The rich industrialist who owns the plant decides
to assemble a crack squad of scientists, doctors and
pollution experts to combat the threat (the first of many
adventures). Sound familiar? Like an environmental A-Team,
perhaps? Just think of this show as "Mission: Recyclable."
   If there's any fundamental improbability to calmly pulling
together a crisis-containment group from all over the globe
just hours before nuclear disaster, you wouldn't know it from
this show. And once all the members are assembled, with the
clock ticking toward ecological catastrophe, what do they do?
Sit down for an elegant, leisurely dinner, of course. Makes
sense to me. Then the team rushes to the site and, with
seconds left, saves the day.
   But wait] The danger isn't over yet. There's still a whole
second hour needed to track down the villain and wrest the
plutonium from his evil hands.
   Since "E.A.R.T.H. Force" lacks the clever, intricate
plotting of a "Mission: Impossible," at least you could hope
for some of the quirky characters of an "A-Team." Instead,
writers and executive producers Richard Chapman and Bill Dial
offer up a bunch of self-righteous do-gooders, certainly one
of the most sanctimonious, humorless groups ever assembled on
the small screen: a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a marine
biologist and an anthropologist.
   This Clean Team is given to railing at everyone in sight.
As they face assorted menaces over the coming weeks, their
deadliest weapon is sure to be their loquacity: "Maybe he
discovered something more important, more important than man
and his ambition, or his need to control the world around
him, to play with it like a spoiled child tinkers with his
toy, until it breaks and he throws it away. {The music
swells.} We've lived on this planet for 50,000 years, and in
the last 200, we've damn near killed it."
   Finding himself behind bars, the physicist naturally
starts castigating his fellow jailbirds for throwing
Styrofoam cups on the floor of the prison: "This is our
environment here," he scolds. "The Parthenon is in ruins;
plastic is forever." And when team members argue with each
other, their insults are lines like: "I've got two Ph.D.s and
an honorary degree from Oxford."
   So when, at the end of this premiere, the team looks
somberly at the camera and announces, "It's a big world out
there, and most of it's asleep. What the hell -- maybe we can
wake it up," you know most of the audience will be snoozing.
   Frankly, an issue as important as the destruction of the
planet deserves a better show. I'm all for attacking
pollution, but what about pollution of the airwaves? Save the
planet? They should have saved their breath.
   ---
   This week marks the official beginning of the 1990-91
television season, and luckily there are at least a couple of
shows with some potential. Two action dramas rooted solidly
in character are "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (CBS, Mondays,
10 p.m. EDT) and "Gabriel's Fire" (ABC, Thursdays, 9 p.m.
EDT).
   "Trials" teams up two "Cagney and Lacey" alums, producer
Barney Rosenzweig and actress Sharon Gless. At first, this
show may appear to be a cut-rate "L.A. Law," with Ms. Gless
as a public defender, wheeling and dealing with the
prosecutor in the courthouse bathroom. But quickly it becomes
clear that Mr. Rosenzweig's plan is to vamp in the vein of
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," to focus not solely on
Rosie O'Neill, lawyer, but Rosie O'Neill, newly divorced
43-year-old, private-school-educated child of privilege who
gave up her corporate practice when her marriage collapsed.
Now she works in the P.D.'s office, but parks her Mercedes
five blocks from the office because she feels guilty about
owning it.
   So far, "Trials" is a full-blooded portrait of a feisty,
hard-charging woman, full of convictions and full of doubts.
She's got a black office mate who isn't thrilled to see her
(he thinks she's slumming) and a mother who can't understand
her choice: "This isn't law; it's street cleaning. You
graduated fifth in your class in law school so you could work
for the sanitation department?"
   So Rosie sits in the dark at her house, eating ice cream
and worrying: "Does my neck look crepey? . . . I wonder when
he decided he didn't love me anymore . . ." But she also has
a nice acerbic edge too, especially when talking about the
woman her husband left her for: "How is Bridget? What is she,
12 now?"
   Although Ms. Gless occasionally wanders over the top as
Rosie, she's creating a good, strong character. For the fans
of Cagney, this should be a treat.
   ---
   Another treat -- a positive joy -- is that James Earl
Jones has finally emerged from under that Darth Vader helmet,
and made it to the small screen in "Gabriel's Fire." As
Gabriel Bird, an ex-con tasting freedom for the first time in
20 years, Mr. Jones was wonderful in the pilot last week, by
turns phlegmatic, confused, exultant. So far, the plotting of
the show looks fairly standard-issue, with Gabriel working
for a female yuppie lawyer as her detective in the coming
episodes, but Mr. Jones positively fills the screen with his
towering voice, his monumental presence. This is clearly the
best acting of the season. Yes, "E.A.R.T.H. Force," the vast
wasteland can be reclaimed . . . More in future columns.

(Shelley Duvall).;   Ramsey soon discovers that it's not easy being a hero on
a mad planet populated with litigious hot-rodders, talking car alarms and
mimes.;   The equally frustrated Charlie, whose only joy in life is mechanical
tinkering, quickly realizes that he's got Darth Vader for a tenant. Breaking
into Ramsey's stash of cool space gizmos, Charlie inadvertently alerts the
star warrior's enemies to his whereabouts.;   The writing here is beyond
scattershot, but that doesn't stop the movie from hitting a few good, satiric
bull's eyes. Part of this is due to the sure touch of the director, old
comic-action hand Burt Kennedy ("Support Your Local Sheriff").;   Lloyd also
deserves credit for some expert physical humor, and Larry Miller (who's
getting all the good notices for "Necessary Roughness") is a scream as
Charlie's conniving, glory-hogging boss.;   As for the Hulkster, well, he
knows how to play Hulk Hogan, and Ramsey is Hulk Hogan with warp drive. The
movie's goofs on his TV wrestler persona are about what you'd expect -- all
over-amped, misplaced aggression.;   Some attempts at softening up his persona
fall flat, too. But when push comes to shove, no one shoves like Hogan. His
underage fans should have no complaints.; Suburban Commando; (star) 1/2;
Rated: PG; Cast: Hulk Hogan, Christopher Lloyd, Shelley Duvall; Director: Burt
Kennedy; Writer: Frank Cappello  </TEXT>

<P>
After his tell-tale wacka-wacka-wacka-wacka had burned white-hot on the totally
awesome trend meter, remember what it sounded like when Pac-Man died -- that
melting bleat as the trendy chomper disappeared into nowhere?
</P>
<P>
Pac-Man once was so ubiquitous that then-President Ronald Reagan could pretend
not to know what it was. But after being told it was "a round thing that
gobbles up money," he could get reporters to guffaw just by quipping, "I
thought that was Tip O'Neill." This was a craze composed of more than mere
blips on a video screen: It was Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia taking their song
"Pac-Man Fever" to the Top Five. It was Chef Boy-ar-Dee adding Pac-Man
characters to a ready-to-eat pasta meal. It was breakfast cereal, T-shirts, a
Hanna-Barbera cartoon show and children's chewable vitamins.
</P>
<P>
It was a platoon of opinion writers employing the vision of Pac-Man to describe
their views on domestic spending, on Wall Street warfare, on the mysteries of
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
It was a seemingly universal whine: Mommy, please just one more quarter.
</P>
<P>
 Then, suddenly, it was silent. Dead. Gone.
</P>
<P>
Can it really be roughly a decade since the little yellow blob and his
bow-headed companion, the even more-popular Ms. Pac-Man, reigned as the
nation's omnipresent pop fad?
</P>
<P>
So where do trends go to die, anyway?
</P>
<P>
If Americans get good and sick of a fad -- whether it's a dusty Darth Vader
belt buckle in a thrift store, an old music video or even a clunky blue Ms.
Pac-Man machine at a Los Angeles taco stand -- what happens then?
</P>
<P>
Well, these days, call it Instant Retro.
</P>
<P>
The 1960s live again now, or at least they did last year; the 1970s are redux
now. Brace yourself, trend-watchers: In Instant Retro, experts and observers
agree, time folds over on itself and we no longer grapple with the idea of
living century to century or even decade to decade.
</P>
<P>
No, in Instant Retro, ideas and items once ubiquitous vanish, then -- zap! --
they're back, instantly reminiscent, quirkily ironic and bittersweet clever.
</P>
<P>
Rise, fall, retro.
</P>
<P>
Are we now really living trend to re-treaded trend? Can it be that something
can be in again as soon as it is out, that everything just is?
</P>
<P>
Listen, is that wacka-wacka-wacka-wacka part of a deeper lesson from the
persistent little yellow guy?
</P>
<P>
Game developers at Atari Games Corp. say they are encouraged about the success
they've had with new versions of Pac-Man, introduced for different home video
game systems, including Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
They hope players will buy Pac-Man not just because they love it, prefer it or
are darn good at playing it, but because they miss it. Remember it. Cherish it.
"When we reintroduced Pac Man, it was an immediate hit," says Atari vice
president Dennis Wood. "Internally, we didn't know whether or not it would be
good as it was. It turned out to be . . . popular beyond our expectations. To
date, it's still our most popular selling game.
</P>
<P>
"It was a type of game that had universal appeal to male and female," he adds.
"Easy to play. Very few games are like that. It's like Monopoly. Fifteen or 20
years from now, you'll see that game out there. It's a classic."
</P>
<P>
It's Instant Retro.
</P>
<P>
And not just for the new devices, either. It's for the old machines too,
because trends hardly die. That Darth Vader belt buckle is oddly perfect for a
night of dancing in one of the many clubs that specialize in remixed '70s disco
hits, and, of course, there are Pac-Man machines left to satisfy those who,
well, never let go.
</P>
<P>
Fans play the old machines in their homes or in between rinse cycles at the
self-service laundry and, now, on home video game systems.
</P>
<P>
Estimating how many of the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man machines still
exist and operate nationwide would be "an impossibility," said Sandy Bettelman
of C. A. Robinson Co. distributors in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The company, which sold thousands of the video games in the Los Angeles area in
the early 1980s, now gets a few back and redistributes them -- some to people
who want them in their homes for sentimental reasons and for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
A Pac-Man video game in its original cabinet would go for about $200 today, he
said, adding a "combination of fondness and cheapness" led him to put Ms.
Pac-Man in his home game room, where he has a dozen "classic" arcade games.
</P>
<P>
Classic? "It was such a big, unusual phenomenon," Bettelman says of Pac-Man.
"When people visit us, that's always the first game they run to."
</P>
<P>
Bally Manufacturing Corp., which sold about 250,000 Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man
machines in the first part of the decade, reported peak revenues of $600
million in 1982 from its amusement game business. But by 1987, revenue from the
games had fallen to $24.3 million. And by 1988, Bally had sold the games
division -- a founding tradition dating to the company's first pinball game in
1931 -- to its chief competitor, WMS Industries, for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, rights to Pac-Man returned to Namco, the Japanese corporation that
had invented the little dude in the first place. It, in turn, has turned over
the license for new home versions of Pac-Man to Atari.
</P>
<P>
"We called it the video bust," said Valerie Cognevich, editor of Play Meter
magazine, a trade journal for the amusement industry. "Actually, the (arcade
game) industry is doing all right now; you just don't hear about it as much.
Pac-Man was certainly the peak, and then a lot of people got out of the
business after that."
</P>
<P>
But now, like owning a stoic jukebox or psychedelic posters, people can buy the
machines and Pac to the limit in a nostalgic corner of their own home.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mendelson, a Los Angeles video game operator who supplies newer video
games as well as older models to area arcades, bought a Ms. Pac-Man machine for
his family to play.
</P>
<P>
After rebuilding the cabinet to accommodate shorter players, the Mendelsons
find themselves playing the game "once a day, at least."
</P>
<P>
Once the craze died down (and the price of the arcade Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man
came down from peak prices of $2,500), Mendelson decided to put one his home
because "it's a great frustration-reliever. It was one the games we remember
and always enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
"People who come by see it and instantly recognize it," he says. "For them,
it's another chance to play something they may not have played for years. I
guess it is nostalgic."
</P>
<P>
Already? Is everything -- pop trends, technology and plain old junk -- just
beginning to wrap together? Is there no longer an in or out?
</P>
<P>
Richard Saul Wurman, author of "Information Anxiety," thinks it's all part of
what he calls the "Age of Also," a time when trends and events no longer occur
in a linear fashion, with one succeeding the next.
</P>
<P>
"We were told we would have paper-less offices with the dawn of computers," he
says. "Now we have offices with twice as much paper and computers. The fax
machine was supposed to eliminate phone calls, but now we call someone to tell
them we're sending them a fax, and they call us back to say they got the fax.
</P>
<P>
"What used to happen," he adds, "is there would be one prevailing trend, like
with music, and then something would replace it. Now we have all forms of music
popular at once, with no leading edge. Television was supposed to mean that we
would have fewer movies, but now we have more of both."
</P>
<P>
Which is not necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
Instant Retro in the Age of Also preserves pop culture for multidecade uses.
"What has happened is in some ways quite wonderful," Wurman says, noting that
today, people are exposed to a wider spectrum of trends and culture,
particularly in music. "It gives us a more parallel view of the world."
</P>
<P>
On the gold lame edge of what threatens to be a massive 1970s retro movement of
music, clogs, sideburns and center-parted hairstyles, it may not be too soon to
consider a resurgence of '80s fads.
</P>
<P>
In these days of Instant Retro, nothing can re-arrive too early. Newly
resuscitated video jockey Martha Quinn peddles classic videos ("classic" as in
videos circa 1984) on MTV. Ralph Lauren prospers. The video disc lives. Rock
stations still play songs by Boston, Queen, Styx and the Go-Go's.
</P>
<P>
And, of course, Pac-Man wacka-wackas on.
</P>
<P>
It plays even in museums. "Hot Circuits," an exhibit of arcade video games
dating to the 1970s at the American Museum of the Moving Image near Queens,
N.Y., invites visitors to play "classic" games with five free tokens.
</P>
<P>
Co-curator David Draigh says the idea for the 45-game exhibition developed from
a desire to "have a retrospective, because looking back at video games, it was
such a mania and all, what with all the public outcry against them at first,
and now how they've settled into our lives."
</P>
<P>
Draigh said that once a list was made of the most influential video games of
the past two decades (Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man figuring prominently), exhibit
staffers went on "kind of an archeological dig" to find old but still-working
video games. The exhibit's success in New York will propel it this year to 10
more American cities, including Seattle.
</P>
<P>
In a world in which many people reminisce about "Star Wars," watch reruns of
"Charlie's Angels" and prefer radio stations that mix "favorite songs from the
yesterdays with the songs of today," what about the genuine art of preserving
nostalgia?
</P>
<P>
"I think it's part of the extraordinary self-consciousness of the age," says
Ricardo Quinones, a Claremont-McKenna College humanities professor who has
written of the relation of time to the cultural past. "Things today are dropped
very quickly and we get on a historical treadmill. We reach back more quickly
to recent objects to recapture them . . . we have decade mania."
</P>
<P>
"Hypernostalgia," as Quinones calls it, is not new. Europeans, during the first
part of the century, also were preoccupied with decades and faddish movements.
</P>
<P>
"Memory is a throwaway now, and as we forget, so too (do) we have instant
nostalgia," he says. "I think these fad things that seem to come back around
faster represent our destiny to be a very self-conscious society . . . and as
we become victims of larger historical amnesia, we get more into trends and
reviving those trends. And, of course, we are all guilty of media events. I
guess the motto of the story is save your skinny ties, and baseball cards,
again and again."
</P>
<P>
Leo Braudy, a USC English professor who also studies pop culture trends, thinks
that as Americans near the end of the century, their nostalgia speeds up.
</P>
<P>
"By 1995, we'll be remembering 1990," he says. "We have such short attention
spans that you can't even predict the return of fashions any more."
</P>
<P>
For some, Braudy said, "Pac-Man could symbolize the Reagan days . . . it was
the metaphor for greed. Can we already be sort of ironic about it? I don't
know."
</P>
<P>
Since Instant Retro provides fads that never really go away, he adds, Americans
comfortably can rely on favorite trends in an increasingly chaotic,
something-new-every-day world: "Maybe there's something kind of cozy about
playing a favorite video game. As the world moves forward, we can create our
own little collages of things from the past."
</P>
<P>
So then, here's a cozy, comforting Instant Retro collage: a swirly, dreamy
roller disco party hosted by Lindsay Wagner as the Bionic Woman. Piped-in
Olivia Newton John songs. Wide rainbow suspenders for all the guests, even E.T.
</P>
<P>
An economics professor, dressed comfortably in an Izod shirt, is on hand to
explain Reaganomics. The Sex Pistols have reunited. A hair salon offers
feathery Farrah-dos, on the house. Little Ricky Schroeder plays with Slime.
</P>
<P>
The Pac-Man tokens are free.
</P>
<P>
Farther down a misty hallway decorated with Carter-Mondale posters, people line
up for gasahol, for free Bicentennial merchandise, for seats at the Patty
Hearst trial.
</P>
<P>
Keep going down this hall and it might just feel cozier all the time. Look,
there's Josie and the Pussycats, and George of the Jungle. A vast auditorium
shows films like "American Graffiti" (vintage 1950s, retro from the 1970s),
interspersed with recurring bits from the Laverne-and-Shirley-o-Rama (vintage
1950s and '60s retro from the '70s and '80s. Weird!).
</P>
<P>
Does this not seem nostalgic? That's the mystery of Instant Retro.
</P>
<P>
If you're leaving, remember to check out the door prizes -- like a Scooby Doo
lunch pail, a big Betamax player, a Radio Shack TRS-80 computer.
</P>
<P>
If you're staying, wear plaid.

   NEW YORK -- If you squint, Robert McKee could almost pass
for Darth Vader. Dressed in black, stocky with dark,
glowering eyebrows, he rumbles into the microphone as 300
rapt students hang on his words. "No, Luke. I am your . . .
{wheeze} . . . father."
   It's the climax of "The Empire Strikes Back," and as
script-writing guru Mr. McKee enacts it, Luke Skywalker has
just learned the true identity of the dread enemy he has been
stalking through two feature-length movies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Socko endings like this -- where the hero comes face to
face with the powerful antagonistic forces arrayed against
him and the plot twists still another time -- well, such
moments are the apex of the screenwriter's art, according to
Mr. McKee.
   "If you can create this most sublime ending of all," he
says, "you too can have a Mercedes and a home in Beverly
Hills."
   It hooks them every time -- in Los Angeles, New York,
Toronto, London and the more than two dozen other cities here
and abroad where Mr. McKee has taken his script-writing
roadshow. For $350 a head, studio executives, performers and
writers (as well as hopefuls) give up a weekend to learn the
lost art of storytelling -- and, by tantalizing implication,
the mysteries of box-office success.
   In his seamless, 30-hour near-monologue, Mr. McKee heaps
disdain upon film-school "auteurs" with their dazzling but
empty camera work. Audiences, he says, hunger for well-told,
classically structured tales, and Hollywood isn't delivering.
As he sniffs the scene: "That's not smog in LA. It's the
stench of all the rotten scripts."
   Movies, he says, are propelled by an "inciting incident"
that pitches the hero's life out of balance and sends him on
a quest to restore that balance. In "Jaws," it was when the
shark ate the swimmer. In "Kramer vs. Kramer," it was Mrs.
Kramer's decision to leave her child with her husband. The
effect on the audience, he suggests, is to provoke the
question "how will this turn out?" and to foreshadow in their
minds the final crisis: when, for example, the sheriff fights
the shark. "Nothing moves forward except through conflict,"
Mr. McKee says. "Conflict is to story as sound is to music."
   By what right does Robert McKee preach story structure to
Kirk Douglas, Diane Keaton and John Cleese? These are some
alums of the course he began as a lark at a Hollywood
experimental school eight years ago and now delivers to 3,000
people annually in North America alone.
   A 50-year-old theatrical actor and director who turned
screenwriter and story analyst in Hollywood, Mr. McKee has
yet to see one of his own scripts on the screen. (Mr. McKee,
whose father made him analyze Aesop's Fables as a childhood
punishment, has written televised episodes of "Quincy" and
"Columbo," and has sold 10 film scripts over the past 10
years, two of which are now in development.)
   Mr. McKee makes no secret of his lack of screen credits;
indeed, he makes use of it in the course. In 1990, he says,
50,000 screenplays were registered with the Writers Guild; he
estimates 250,000 were actually written. Hollywood, after
spending some $500 million annually to option ideas and
scripts, produces 400 to 500 movies -- about one for every 20
optioned.
   To writers who whine that their gems go unbought and
unrecognized, he flings unprintable expletives. "Write a
brilliant original screenplay and Hollywood's doors fly
open," he says. "It's a seller's market." But quality merely
gets you into the race, he warns. If Julia Roberts pulls out,
or if financing falls through -- well, such are the vagaries
of the business.
   Screen credits or no, Mr. McKee has something of a cult
following. Hollywood brass once registered for the course
under pseudonyms, but today it is more often worn as a badge.
Freddie Fields, who produced "Glory," says the course
inspired him to start his first screenplay. Quincy Jones
attended, then bought tickets for people at his production
company. So did Corbin Bernsen of "LA Law." One result, Mr.
Bernsen says, is that writers at his company, Team Cherokee
Entertainment, are now taking more time to craft TV scripts.
And rather than merely pitching ideas around Hollywood, they
"put them in writing," a McKee maxim.
   On a recent weekend, a capacity crowd shuffles into a
windowless auditorium at Hunter College, Mr. McKee's New York
venue. Stand-bys mill around during registration, including
one woman who has driven from Rhode Island in hopes of
filling the seat of a no-show.
   The audience crackles with anticipation; we have heard the
advance word-of-mouth. And Robert McKee has a compelling
story to tell. It's a riveting -- if exhausting -- journey
into the dark night of the human soul and back again --
transcendentally -- at the climax. It's Schopenhauer and
Sophocles as well as Schwarzenegger; metaphysics as much as
mechanics.
   Dogmatic, profane and inspiring by turns, he paces the
weekend like a wellcrafted script: punching up material with
comic subplots, skewering pretention and dropping nuggets of
movie lore (how in "Casablanca," Bogart wore four-inch
platform shoes to dance with Bergman, and how "Here's looking
at you, kid" is dubbed "To your health" in Italian).
   We learn how movie mores evolve with the times, a fact
that scriptwriters ignore at their peril. In "Falling in
Love," the relationship between Robert De Niro and Meryl
Streep was thwarted because they were each married to someone
else. (Mr. McKee yawns pointedly, saying, "The audience
screamed inside: `What is their PROBLEM? Dump the stiffs]'")
   He explains that the female audience's empathy with the
psychopath played by Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction"
surprised the movie's creators, and that she lost that
empathy only after boiling the pet rabbit. "Do anything you
want to a human being," he says, "but {torture} a bunny and
we drop you like a hot rock."
   We are advised to fall in love with our characters --
especially our villains. When the Terminator cuts out his eye
with an X-acto knife and then checks his reflection in the
mirror and smoothes his hair, the terrifying contradiction
grows out of the writer's "love for her Terminator," Mr.
McKee says.
   As we wend our way through text and subtext, the arc of
the scene, conflict, controlling ideas and plot turns, some
bristle at Mr. McKee's curt dismissal of audience
interruptions. "It's Seven Stages of Enlightenment -- No
Questions," mutters one television writer during a break.
   Though a few people creep out during the six-hour,
frame-by-frame structural analysis of "Casablanca" that winds
up the weekend, attrition is otherwise almost nil. And at the
close, after Mr. McKee sings his rendition of "As Time Goes
By," there's a standing ovation.
   "Amazing," says Mike Shatzkin, a writer and book
publishing consultant. "My first reaction when it was over
was, `Well, what else would you like to talk to me about for
three days?'"
   Mr. McKee, whose company, Two Arts Inc., is based in Los
Angeles, does this about two dozen times a year, reaping
enough income from the course and his $2,000 private script
consultations to qualify as a millionaire. But do his
students benefit tangibly as well?
   "There's a tendency to see this in the most cynical light
-- of the sheep coming to be sheared," he says. "I'm no fool
-- I know that of the 300 people here in New York, if one or
two screenplays of excellence grew out of this, it would be a
very successful course. But that's the nature of art -- the
odds are thousands to one against achieving great success."
   In the end, we return to a point he drives home in the
lecture with a scene from "Moulin Rouge." In it,
Toulouse-Lautrec is showing someone the Venus de Milo. It was
dug up by a farmer, and "no one knows who made it," the
artist says. "But it doesn't matter. For he had the pleasure
of doing it."

<TEXT>
   LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and
Kim Basinger led Mr. Blackwell's 30th annual list of worst-dressed
celebrities today, while praise went to Geena Davis, Liza Minnelli,
Barbara Bush and Princess Diana.
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Princess Anne, Emily Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and
gave a shared dishonor to Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   Model-actress Grace Jones won ``Fashion Fiasco of the Year'' for
an outfit Blackwell described as ``Darth Vader's S-and-M fantasy in
a bird cage.''
   Miss Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will
be the ``Cher for the 90's'' who is ``more fashion freak than biker
chic ... in leather and chains,'' said Blackwell.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and Batman's Miss Basinger was a ``parading
peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Blackwell reduced Princess Anne to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,''
Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequined slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna-Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy ...
and cartoon campy.''
   Joining the list of ``Fabulous Fashion Independents'' were Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Walters, Angela Lansbury, Tina
Brown, Ivana Trump and Jacqueline Onassis.

As a member of the NRA, I think there ought to be a referee to whom I could
complain that the magazine published a picture of a NRA member clowning in a
Darth Vader-ish helmet and then showed gun-controller Sen. Dennis DeConcini
smiling under a ceiling light that gave the effect of a halo.

<LEADPARA>  SINCE it is the story of the moment -- how did the Julia Roberts-Jason Patric
"thing" happen, causing the cancellation of her wedding to Kiefer Sutherland?
OK, here's the hot inside skinny. She met him by accident on a plane when she
was taking her mother and her bridesmaids to the Canyon Ranch on the weekend
of June 8.;    There was a truly incandescent moment between Roberts and
Patric, said to have been observed with some foreboding and worry by the
entire wedding party. But the rest is history. And my insider says, "It's
very, very real!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Hey, let's not wear black over this. Roberts was wise and sincere to call
off her wedding in such a case. Sounds like a scene right out of "The
Philadelphia Story." Canceled weddings and sudden revelations of true love
used to be epidemic in movie romances.;     REMEMBER HOW Winchell used to do
it (with the dots)? . . . Diana Rigg, the wonderful heroine of TV's "The
Avengers" and a really fine classical actress as well, has reconciled with her
producer-hubby, Archie Stirling. (She filed for divorce over his romance with
Vanessa Redgrave's daughter, Joley Richardson.) . . . Nat King Cole's
biographer, Leslie Gourse, will follow her "Unforgettable" book with one on
the life of the late Sarah Vaughan. "She was the Leontyne Price of jazz," sez
Gourse . . . They are talking look-alike Kurt Russell to play Pete Rose in the
movie of his life . . . Quincy Jones will be seen as a pirate in a cameo for
Steven Spielberg's epic "Hook," and the movie's star, Dustin Hoffman,
describes him as "the Darth Vader of this film." . . . Michael Jackson has
been vacationing with friends in Bermuda. He came and went from the legendary
Hamilton Princess via a private plane. While enjoying his R&amp;R, Jackson asked
for mopeds, snorkeling equipment, a hot-air popcorn maker and Nintendo games
in his suite.;    TV CHATTER: The talk of TV is Dena Kaye's hot new "A Sense
of Place" show on the Travel Channel. Everybody sits around letting down
his/her hair and chatting about the realities of glamorous destinations.;
Kaye has snagged Gael Greene, Kitty Carlisle Hart, Ed Koch, Diane von
Furstenberg, Maud Frizon, Paloma Picasso, Walter Cronkite, Beverly Sills, Iris
Love, Anna Bulgari, Franco Ciarlo.;    Kitty Hart says: "Stop asking your
travel agent; just tune in 'A Sense of Place' if you really want to know the
best places to go.";    PARTY TIME: We have not seen the mighty media tycoon
Rupert Murdoch in these parts in some weeks, but he'll be the talk of the town
on Wednesday when he holds a posh party at Le Cirque's L'Orangerie to
celebrate his editor-in-chief, Grace Mirabella, and the magazine he created
and named for her.;    This does make it look as if the rumors are wrong that
Murdoch wants to sell or divest himself of Mirabella. And editor Amy Gross
just called to ask me to write several pieces for them. So I guess they are
not exactly putting on the brakes at Mirabella after all. Good thing; good
magazine!;    PEOPLE ARE TALKING about the parlay of Ali MacGraw and Julia
Phillips on the same London chat show, promoting their books about
disillusioned life in Hollywood. Although Phillips was quite abrasive, MacGraw
remained cool and articulate. Phillips tried to involve MacGraw in her
invective against the system, but the latter wouldn't rise to the bait.; From
Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;     STROKE OF BAD LUCK: Jack
Lemmon -- who loves golf more than practically anything -- has been forced to
bow out of the inaugural Jack Lemmon Invitational golf tourney in Pebble Beach
next month to honor his commitment to "Glengarry Glen Ross.";    The
big-screen adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Glengarry Glen
Ross" has been a pending project for Lemmon for quite some time, but has just
become a firm go for producer Jerry Tokofsky. Al Pacino and Alec Baldwin are
set to co-star with Lemmon -- and with at least a dozen other major actors
vying for the four remaining lead parts in the drama about a group of seven
shady real-estate development salesmen.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  OFTEN I am asked which science fiction films I think are the best ever made.
That, of course, comes down to the question of what constitutes "SF" in a
film? Everyone has a slightly different definition. My own bias runs toward
plot and characterization rather than setting or set dressing.;    "Blade
Runner," for instance, is a visually brilliant film, but plot-wise it's just
an old noir detective film. "The Terminator" may feature time travel and a
robot, but those are just set dressing -- excuses for an action epic.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DISCOVERING THE WONDER OF SCIENCE FICTION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Apel, Mercury News video columnist, hosts KTEH-TV's science-fiction programs
on Sunday nights.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Most often I look for a philosophy -- a point of view that explores the
effect of science (real or imagined) on human values and relationships. And I
always look for a sense of awe or wonder.;    With these criteria in mind, my
nominations for the Top 10 science fiction films of all time (in no particular
order) include the following, all readily available on video:;    "2001: A
Space Odyssey" (1968; MGM/UA). Director Stanley Kubrick's visually stunning
but frustrating puzzle seems to be telling us that humanity is inseparable
from its tools: Before tools, we were apes; after transcending them, we become
something more than human. A Jungian philosophical treatise with enough
material to fuel endless debates as to "meaning," as well as a catalog of
numinous landscapes of physical and mental space.;    "Forbidden Planet"
(1956; MGM/UA). This prestigious, intelligent picture is a loose adaptation of
Shakespeare's "The Tempest." The otherworldly wonder, psychological plot,
eerie electronic score and truly awesome special effects still send shivers
through viewers.;    "Star Wars" (1977; CBS/Fox). OK, so it's only a big comic
book with cardboard cutouts as heroes. It's still the best space opera ever
recorded and wonderful fun. The trilogy changed the face of filmmaking and
rocketed SF to public prominence.;    "Aliens" (1986; CBS/Fox). The original
("Alien", 1979) had a novel look but was essentially a "killer in the house"
horror story. This sequel blended SF and horror to create one of the most
suspenseful films ever produced.;    "Back to the Future," parts I, II and III
(1985, 1989 and 1990; MCA). This ecstatic comedy series about the crisscross
temporal adventures of Marty and Doc is brilliant, down to the minuscule
details of plot, pacing, characterization, setting, special effects and even
props. Strangely, the most intensely sci-fi part of the trilogy -- Part II,
involving alternate time lines and a future as fully defined as that in "Blade
Runner" -- was the least popular.;    "E.T., The Extraterrestrial" (1982;
MCA). Yet to be surpassed by any SF film for emotional involvement, Steven
Spielberg's update of Peter Pan exposes us to awe, wonder, love, heartbreak --
and our own lost innocence. An affecting world-class film in any category.;
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1980; RCA/Columbia). Spielberg again, in
a fledgling step toward crystallizing a world myth for the 21st century. This
suspenseful entry singlehandedly reversed cinematic portrayals of aliens from
evil bug-eyed monsters to wise, benign friends.;    "The Day The Earth Stood
Still" (1951; CBS/Fox). Science and reason are roundly trounced by fear and
force in this intelligent cautionary tale about the dangers of xenophobia and
anti-intellectualism.;    "Metropolis" (1926; Vestron &amp; Budget). A timeless
political metaphor, with effects still dazzling and unique today.;    "The Man
Who Fell to Earth" (1976; RCA/Columbia). David Bowie plays a convincing alien
in this strange, dark and artful film about human greed, insensitivity and
shortsightedness. A more positive choice, however, would be "Slaughterhouse
Five" (1972; MCA), Kurt Vonnegut's mystical vision thinly disguised as
"science fiction."  </TEXT>

FACES . . . : A DARKER CAPT. HOOK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Captain Hook, that shiny meat hook of a hand slashing through the air, has
always been a child's bedtime villain, good for a little nightmare for the tots
but really a figure of innocent squealish delight for children raised on Darth
Vader.
</P>
<P>
Now comes actor Stephen Hanan, co-starring with Cathy Rigby in "Peter Pan" at
the Pantages, who turns theater's most popular, dastardly pirate into a
menacing psychotic.
</P>
<P>
"The concept going into this show," said Broadway veteran Hanan, "was to play
Hook more darkly, to catch the lighter side of evil and capture his cavernous
abysses of grief and heartbreak. He wants revenge for his childhood. Hook was
Barrie's critique of the British class system, which is all in Barrie's novel
(1911). Hook is the nightmare version of the children's Daddy" (Mr. Darling,
whom Hanan also plays in a double role).
</P>
<P>
The show is a hard ticket here, closing at the Pantages July 1 and continuing
on tour through the country until it winds up on Broadway in December.
</P>
<P>
Hanan, 43, a classically trained actor from Washington who was Tony-nominated
for his work in "Cats," broke into theater singing Italian arias for money
outside the San Francisco Ferry Terminal between 1971 and 1977. "It was the era
of Woodstock, and I had just come back from a year on a Fulbright Fellowship in
London, where my training ) had made me very idealistic about theater. My agent
would only send me out for commercials, so I became a full-tilt hippie."
</P>
<P>
He's written a play about that period, about Haight-Asbury, entitled "Rainbow's
Return," which was produced last year in Hampton, N.Y. In fact, Hanan has
written five plays.
</P>
<P>
"I act to support my writing habit," he said with a grin. RAY LOYND

<HEAD>Dutch Police Chase Purported Vehicle From Outer Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police deployed a dozen patrol
cars and a helicopter in a late-night chase for a craft from outer
space, a police spokesman said Friday.
   The hunt, accompanied by dozens of calls from all over the Dutch
capital reporting unidentified flying objects, failed to yield
anything extra-terrestrial, according to spokesman Klaas Wilting.
   ``We were alerted late Thursday night by Schiphol (airport) air
traffic controllers who observed bright lights in a stationary
position over the port area which didn't show up on their radar
screens,'' Wilting said.
   After a radio newscast had mentioned the Schiphol sighting,
calls started pouring in from all over the city, describing objects
ranging from ``airplane-like things to fantastic contraptions with
Darth Vader at the helm,'' said Wilting.
   Around midnight, 12 patrol cars and a police helicopter were
involved, Wilting said.
   After several hours, ``we found nothing except some strong lamps
on top of a 50-meter (150-foot) high crane in the harbor,'' which
might have been visible from the airport's control tower, Wilting
said.
   ``We think it was a classic example of popular delusion, coupled
with a number of jokers trying to pull a trick on us,'' the
spokesman said.

<HEAD>10 Worst-Dressed Fashion Frumps `A Parade of Terrors,'' Mr.
Blackwell Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Blackwell, the acid-tongued clothes
critic who crusades against crimes of fashion, has placed singer
LaToya Jackson atop his most-wanted list, calling her ``Cher for
the 1990s.''
   And in case you think that's a compliment, think again. Cher
also made Blackwell's 1989 10 Worst-Dressed Women list, along with
eight other actresses, singers and a member of the British royal
family.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' the
outspoken oracle of style said of Miss Jackson, who gained
notoriety when she posed nude for Playboy magazine. ``If I had her
face and body I'd stay in bed all day.''
   Blackwell also had unkind words about the sartorial splendor of
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Daryl Hannah, Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th, Madonna
and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could be mistaken
for a baglady.''
   Blackwell reserved special dishonorable mention for singer Grace
Jones, whom he termed ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a martian
birdcage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home Wednesday to unveil the
30th annual Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and ``Batman'' star Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,'' Cher
to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequinned slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna and Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy
... and cartoon campy.''
   While some have questioned Blackwell's fashion credentials, he
boasts that he formerly designed dresses for a distinguished
clientele, including Zsa Zsa Gabor and Marilyn Monroe, before
devoting full attention to his yearly list.
   ``I was a fashion designer with 450 accounts all over the world,
but I left it two years ago when the miniskirt came back,'' he said.
   Blackwell said he does the list so that ``people who want star
status don't make a mistake and copy'' the fashion frumps.
   After reading off the fashion rap sheet, Blackwell turned his
attention to a select group of woman he considers fashion paragons.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, Angela Lansbury,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Liza Minnelli, Barbara
Walters, Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me.
   ``I adore many of them as performers,'' he said.

<HL> In This Market, Maybe Hard Hats Would Be the Appropriate Attire </HL>
<AUTHOR> George Anders (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> SCR </IN>
<TEXT>
   With stock market confidence already shattered, some floor traders at the New York Stock Exchange are taking drastic measures to ward off further bad luck this Friday the 13th.

   They are wearing hats.

   Today is "Hat Day" on the exchange, and word has gone out that members must cover their pates -- or be prepared to suffer the consequences.

   According to Arthur Cashin, a floor broker for PaineWebber Inc., the logic couldn't be simpler: As everybody knows, it's bad luck to wear a hat indoors; but since today is Friday the 13th, the reverse should hold true.
So wear a Stetson, fedora, Yankees cap or bowler.
Then, stand back and watch the bull market roar.

   Maybe that'll happen, maybe not.
On the most recent previous Hat Day -- it came on Nov. 13, 1987 -- traders showed up sporting everything from football helmets to women's straw hats, the price tags still attached.
And with the October crash fresh in their minds, a surprising number of them kept their hats on throughout the day, hoping for one good session in an otherwise unnerving season.

   Mr. Cashin went so far as to bring six hats to work that day.
And in informal balloting for best hat, he won with what some traders thought was a Darth Vader mask. (Actually, it was a Korean helmet he picked up in a second-hand martial arts store.
"It had leather drapings behind it, and all this great grillwork in front," he recalls.)

   Meanwhile, John Lyden, the marketmaker in Duke Power Co. stock, opted for a combat general's hat with five stars on the front.

   And both he and Mr. Cashin were among those who paraded through the exchange floor.
Sure, everyone got to show off their headgear.
But what they really wanted was a different kind of display.

   Unfortunately, it didn't come, and by day's end the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 25.20 points.

   Still, that hasn't much damped the traders' enthusiasm for today's event.
And though not all of the Big Board's 2,700 floor traders and brokers will play along, a fair number will, including, of course, the redoubtable Mr. Cashin.

   "I'll probably either wear a bowler, or this green homberg hat I bought in Jersey City," he says, adding, "I don't know if wearing hats really helps, but you feel better doing it."

<IN> APCI SUNW
COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN>
<TEXT>
   The cover of High Technology magazine recently featured two of the world's hottest computer designers posed next to their latest creations.
The computers looked similar, but not their makers.

   Representing Apollo Computer Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass., was engineer David Nelson, coiffed and immaculately garbed in a gray suit and a silk tie.
His rival from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., was William Joy, pictured in a bulky sweater, with a fringe of beard and determinedly unkempt hair.

   This is a story of how East Coast meets West Coast-head-on-in the bruising computer marketplace.
Five years ago both Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computer were upstart, entrepreneurial firms, striving to make a mark in the horizonless computer business.

   "It was like two rowboats in the Pacific Ocean," recalls Robert Smith, Sun's vice president and chief financial officer.
"We never saw each other."

   Today, they are competing chin to chin for sales in their significant niche, the $1.5 billion work-station business, and trying hard to keep at bay such big players as International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Inc. and Apple Computer Inc.
Both companies say the deciding factor in the war -- as important as their products and prices -- could be their radically different corporate cultures.

   To be sure, both companies are go-go computer companies, with fanatical, bearded engineers and executives who glide to work in candy-colored Ferraris.

   But Apollo, situated near Massachusetts' famed Route 128, is turning into a buttoned-down, traditional company, eager to overcome a few missteps of its more flamboyant early days.
Sun, nestled in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, is ebullient and, at times, downright loony.
The company throws monthly beer bashes, and on Halloween employees report to work in gorilla suits.

   It is a fight between a company trying to grow up and one that remains intentionally brash and ruthless.
The companies' personalities are reflected in their products, their marketing strategies -- and the occasional cheap shot fired from the chief executive officer's desk.

   "In this country, everything loose rolls to the West Coast," says Apollo's chairman, 53-year-old Thomas A. Vanderslice.

   Those are fighting words to Scott McNealy, Sun's extroverted, 32-year-old president, who points out that his company surpassed Apollo in sales in the quarter ended March 31, 1987.
"If I'd set a goal of beating Apollo," says the hyperactive Mr. McNealy, who carries a cellular phone on the golf course, "I'd already be done."

   A work station is a powerful personal computer used by engineers, scientists, printers and money managers to do such tasks as product design and investment planning.
Its graphics are precise -- a screen can contain more than one million dots of light -- and it can accomplish dozens of tasks at once.
Work stations, which retail for $5,000 to $80,000, can also be linked together in a network.

   Business is booming.
Last year, the work-station market grew 65% to $1.5 billion, according to Dataquest Inc., a market-research company.
Growth could reach 50% again this year.
Apollo had a 26% share of the market in 1986, compared with Sun's 23%.

   But Sun is growing considerably faster and is more profitable.
In the quarter ended March 31, Sun's sales grew 146% to $141 million.
That topped Apollo's $123.4 million, a 50% increase from the year-earlier period.
Sun earned $10.2 million, compared with Apollo's $6.4 million.
In addition, Sun sells more units than Apollo, at a lower cost per unit.

   To understand the current state of the battle, it is important to know the brief but turbulent history of the business and the two different paths that the once-similar companies have chosen.

   Apollo invented the work station.
The company was founded in 1980 by a prominent electronics engineer, J. William Poduska, who had a track record of successful designs for minicomputers.
Thanks to his reputation, the company had no trouble raising capital; his connections in the business gave Apollo an early boost in the marketing of its products.
In 1981 it released its first work station, the DN 100, which sold for $45,000.

   In 1984, the rapidly expanding company hired Mr. Vanderslice, a chemistry Ph.D. who rose through the ranks at General Electric Co. and who was once the president of GTE Corp.
His job was to guide Apollo's explosive growth.
On his first day at the company, he was greeted by executives wearing sweat shirts emblazoned with the slogan "Billion Dollars or Bust." (Total sales in 1986 were $392 million.)
Mr. Vanderslice replaced Mr. Poduska as chairman in 1984.

   Meanwhile, on the West Coast, two M.B.A.s from Stanford University joined forces with two local computer whizzes and decided to build and sell work stations.
All four men were 27 years old.
Their strategy was markedly different from Apollo's.
The four men believed the market wouldn't accept a work station custom-designed by unknown graduate students.
So they devised a machine that used a standard operating system called Unix, originally designed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
It also was designed to communicate with other computers over Ethernet, a widely used local-area network. (In contrast, Apollo's first models used a custom-designed operating system and were incompatible with any computer network.)
In 1982, Sun shipped its first product, the Sun-1.

   The risk was plain: that another company could make a cheaper work station using the same standards.
But, Mr. Joy says, "If you believe in change and your engineers are good, then you can adapt."

   From the start, therefore, the companies were forced onto different paths.
Apollo had a machine that was incompatible with other machines, higher in price and, by most measures, the superior product on the market.
Sun, the newcomer, had a standardized machine, which was cheaper to produce, easier to sell to a varied market, and even easier to discount.

   Then, Apollo took a few stumbles.
In 1984, its main customers, the large semiconductor companies, went into a slump and stopped buying capital equipment.
The slump occurred just months after Apollo completed an expensive factory and hired hundreds of new employees.

   At the same time, customers were complaining about quality problems in Apollo machines and, rather rapidly, they started warming up to Sun's cheaper work stations.
Apollo had to abandon its exclusive design and produce a work station that operates on standard software. (Today, all Apollo stations can use the Unix operating system.)
With the help of Mr. Vanderslice, the company began broadening its customer base.
Last year, profit was minimal, but by late 1986 the company had begun to turn around.

   Sun, which never stumbled, continued to chop prices and to move relentlessly into Apollo's customer base.
Recently, it dropped prices on its cheapest work station by 37% to $4,995, making it competitive with some personal computers.
That work station is now half the price of Apollo's cheapest machine, and the price cutting elicits a sad shake of the head from Chairman Vanderslice.
"I wouldn't have done that," he says. (Nonetheless, Apollo has had to follow the price-cutting trend and last month it slashed prices on its low-end models.)

   How the battle proceeds from here is unknown, but many in the industry think the ultimate success of Apollo or Sun will depend on the very different personalities of the companies -- crucial factors in determing whether either company can rise to challenges or weather tough times.

   Apollo is trying to build an image of solid, long-term reliability, both as a vendor and as an employer.
Mr. Vanderslice says that the company's troubles and its recovery have made it more competitive and more mature.
Its decisions generally come from the top.

   The managers at Sun, in contrast, affect an attitude of sheer, unrestrained invincibility, and its corporate style embodies the open-collar, open-door, protocol-free ambiance of California.

   At Sun, every Friday is a dress-down day.
Most workers wear jeans and sport shirts.
On April Fool's Day, by tradition, engineers must torment their bosses.
This year they placed Mr. Joy's Ferrari on a platform in the middle of the company's decorative pond.

   In previous years, the engineers disassembled an executive's car and reassembled it inside his office; they disassembled the man's office and reassembled it in the middle of the pond.
The pattern is frighteningly clear, says Mr. Joy: "Car in office, office in pond, car in pond."
Next year, he fears, he will find the pond in his office.

   The office of Mr. McNealy, Sun's president, looks more like a '60s dorm room than a corporate suite.
Pins on a wall map mark the top golf courses in the U.S. Also on the wall are a pair of flip-flops-with golf spikes.
Robert R. Lux, a Sun vice president who was hired away from Apollo, says, "It was a real eye-opener for me when McNealy came in in a polo shirt and high-fived me in the hallway."

   Mr. McNealy favors wide-open discussion among his managers and heated disputes in committees.
Mr. McNealy brags that Sun has maintained the hothouse atmosphere of a start-up company.
"We're a Fortune 500-size company," he says, "but I have trouble finding a parking space at 5:30."

   In contrast, the parking lots in Chelmsford, at Apollo's low-rise headquarters, are almost empty in the evening and on weekends.
Executives urge the staff to work harder.
"We're pushing to get people to work the 41st hour every week," says Edward Zander, vice president for marketing.

   The atmosphere is decidedly corporate, with closed doors, scheduled meetings and a library hush in the executive suite.
Mr. Lux recalls: "It's more a buttoned-jacket style.
From 9:15 to 9:20 you discuss an issue and at 9:20 you approve it."

   Apollo's managers bristle at comparisons with Sun and the suggestion that they lack an entrepreneurial spirit.
"There's a lot to be said for being professional," says Roland Pampel, senior vice president.
"We have people doing a lot of fun stuff.
That doesn't mean . . . you don't wear suits."

   But managers have been instructed to encourage fun on the job.
At a recent employee rally, the lordly Mr. Vanderslice startled workers by appearing on stage in a Luke Skywalker costume to do battle with a Darth Vader look-alike.
Darth Vader sported a Sun logo on his chest.

   Analysts award Mr. Vanderslice high marks for reviving Apollo.
"He's doing what everyone thought he was the wrong kind of manager to do -- turning around an entrepreneurial company that got in trouble," says Richard Shaffer, the editor of Technologic Computer Letter.
Mr. Vanderslice's key moves included controlling soaring costs, diversifying markets, and installing quality control to prevent work stations that were too often dead on delivery.

   With the market growing rapidly, many analysts predict success for both companies.
The big question is whether Apollo can keep up with its flashier competitor.
Also important: If the market takes a twist, can the juggernaut Sun recover?

   "Sun has the potential to be larger if it pulls off its plans," says Vicki Brown of International Data Corp., a market-research company.
If times get tough, she says, "it could end up in a lot of trouble."

   Much will depend on the behavior of the major computer makers.
IBM is expected to become more competitive in the work-station market and Digital Equipment recently halved prices on some machines competing directly with Apollo's and Sun's.
Hewlett-Packard is already a strong contender.
Moreover, new personal computers by IBM and Apple have work-station power.

<HEAD>10 Worst-Dressed Fashion Frumps `A Parade of Terror,'' Mr.
Blackwell Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell, who has ripped
into the wardrobes of celebrities for three decades, put LaToya
Jackson atop his worst-dressed roll Wednesday because he considers
her more freak than chic.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' said the
outspoken oracle of style. ``If I had her face and body I'd stay in
bed all day.''
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th,
Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell, a designer. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could
be mistaken for a bag lady.''
   The year's uncontested fashion frump, however, was singer Grace
Jones: ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a Martian bird cage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home to unveil the 30th annual
Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
actress Miss Moore, wife of actor Bruce Willis, was ``a spandexed
`Nightmare on Willis Street,'' and ``Batman's'' Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Britain's Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and
frumpy,'' entertainer Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a
sequinned slingshot,'' actress Miss Lloyd to ``a sweater girl for
Field &amp; Stream,'' actress Miss Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on
steroids,'' singer-choreographer Miss Abdul to a ``fashion gypsy
(who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and singer
Madonna-comedian Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy,
trampy ... and cartoon campy.''
   Blackwell, resplendent in a black double-breasted suit, also had
something good to say.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, actress Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, actress Angela
Lansbury, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, entertainer
Liza Minnelli, television personality Barbara Walters, Vanity Fair
editor Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Special barbs were aimed at Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler,
perennial Blackwell favorites who have been on his worst-dressed
list so often they are now lifetime holders of the dishonor.
   ``We don't have any star-status people anymore _ the Elizabeth
Taylors,'' he said. ``Poor Bette Midler, she's helpless. Why
bother? And Barbra Streisand, she's on some kick for visual
self-destruction.
   ``I don't know how she has a mirror in the house.''
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ actresses Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me. I adore many of them as performers.''
   Blackwell also offered a dreary forecast for the 1990s.
   ``After a decade of glitz, it will be dull, boring and drab,
almost to a point where fashion will be mourning itself,'' he said.
The fashion future? ``Understatement is the trend for the 1990s.''

'CRASH TV,' NEW GAME-SHOW GENRE, SET TO GO 'BANG'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the creators of today's "trash TV" programs, the producers of a new crop
of high-action game shows prefer to call their product "reality television."
</P>
<P>
But, like it or not, the press has already dubbed them "crash TV" -- and the
new "crash" genre debuts with a bang Sunday at 5 p.m. on KTLA Channel 5 with
"The Interceptor," the first of three unconventional, high-impact entries into
the game-show arena that are expected to appear next season.
</P>
<P>
"The Interceptor," produced by Four Point Productions and distributed by Fries
Entertainment, will premiere as a one-hour special on about 100 TV stations
nationwide. The producers hope that if the pilot proves popular, stations will
want to order "Interceptor" as a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
Two other crash games, "RollerGames" from Qintex Entertainment and "The
Gladiators" from Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment, are expected to premiere by next
fall.
</P>
<P>
Instead of buying a vowel, picking a category, choosing Bachelor No. 2 or
dressing up like a tomato to select Door No. 3, "crash TV" takes its players
outside the safety of a studio set. In "RollerGames," skilled contestants on
roller skates will do battle on a huge figure-eight track featuring a 14-foot
"wall of death" and a live alligator pit. "The Gladiators" will throw ordinary
weaklings into the fray with metal-clad warriors in costume.
</P>
<P>
"The Interceptor," hosted by Erik Estrada, is probably the tamest of the trio.
This game pairs contestants with celebrity guests, each carrying a large
backpack containing information about possible prize winnings. Their quest: to
find the keys to the backpacks while following a harrowing five-mile course,
pursued by the Interceptor.
</P>
<P>
In the pilot, the Interceptor is a stunt man dressed in black, with a Darth
Vader-esque mask and voice, who amuses himself by hunting down the players via
motorcycle, helicopter and on foot.
</P>
<P>
His personality, voice and costume may change in subsequent games, said
producer Ron Ziskin: "One week, he could be RoboCop -- the next, GI Joe, or the
Lone Ranger."
</P>
<P>
Contestants must make it to the end of the course without being "killed" by the
Interceptor's gun. Once a contestant gets hit, the key will no longer unlock
the backpack; the player goes home with a consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
Although Ziskin calls "Interceptor" reality television, the half-hour game is
edited down from about two hours of film, shot by eight different camera crews,
plus a camera placed in the Interceptor's helmet. The producers also added a
throbbing music sound track to enhance the suspense, just as in a television
drama. Ziskin argues that the editing does not affect the reality or fairness
of the competition: "It's still the same game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ziskin believes "Interceptor" and the other crash TV games represent a response
to the audience's restlessness with traditional TV formats.
</P>
<P>
"What's more, the programmers themselves are kind of bored with today's
programming. They're looking for new ways to create interesting television," he
said. "It's an important program in that it is a new form, the first of this
reality group to hit the air, fully executed. It'll be very interesting to see
how it performs."

<TEXT>
   After a year of open warfare, leaders of the cable television and motion picture industries are attempting to settle things at the bargaining table.

   At a closed-door session Tuesday at Warner Communications Inc.'s New York headquarters, about 10 top cable and motion picture executives held the first of what participants said would be several meetings to resolve a wide range of public policy, programming and financial matters.
These include copyright issues and the concentration of power in both industries.

   Those at the session wouldn't discuss it, but sources familiar with the talks said they were initiated at the urging of Warner's chairman and chief executive, Steven J. Ross.
Warner is the only major company that owns both a movie studio, Warner Brothers, and a large cable concern, Warner Cable.

   Because of his dual interests, sources said, Mr. Ross didn't attend.
Although Warner declined comment, Mr. Ross is known to have become increasingly concerned about the feuding between the two industries.

   The meeting brought together for the first time some industry leaders who have communicated mainly by trading insults publicly.
They included John Malone, president of the largest cable concern, Tele-Communications Inc., and Jack Valenti, the Motion Picture Association of America president who in the past dubbed Mr. Malone "Darth Vader" and referred to the cable industry as a "viral contagion" because of its growing concentration.

   Troubles between the movie and cable industries began escalating last year after broad deregulation freed cable to raise prices to consumers.
But the retention of other rules that favor cable led motion picture producers and others to charge that cable is now an unregulated monopoly.
Cable executives, meanwhile, charge that a handful of Hollywood studios control the programming market and are trying to protect their own interests and not the consumer.

   Both sides will come under scrutiny this spring when the House telecommunications subcomittee plans hearings on cable deregulation and other matters.
Executives of both industries say that the group of cable and movie executives who met this week may be able to arrive at some compromises that will satisfy regulators.

   Among the issues discussed, for example, is the copyright payments cable companies make to studios.
A recent court ruling said cable operators may have to double their payments for carrying certain copyrighted television shows; industry executives are trying to arrive at a formula that would satisfy both sides.

   Other cable operators at the meetings included Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of Time Inc.'s 80%-owned American Television &amp; Communications; Amos B. Hostetter Jr., chairman and chief executive of Continental Cablevision Inc.; National Cable Television Association President James Mooney; and Robert Miron, executive vice president of Newhouse Broadcasting Co.

   On the movie side, the delegates at the New York meeting included Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film Co.; MGM/UA Communications Corp. Chairman Lee Rich; and Arthur Barron, who oversees Gulf &amp; Western Inc.'s entertainment operations, including Paramount Pictures Corp.

   A Wisconsin machinist celebrated his 33rd
birthday by quitting his job.
   But Tom Hall didn't make a rash decision _ at least not for
someone who won a $20 million lottery jackpot as a birthday
present, the second-largest lottery winning ever in Illinois.
   ``I am very, very happy, absolutely overwhelmed,'' Hall said
Tuesday.
   ``I took a personal day off work today, but I guess by tonight
they will realize I won't be going back to work,'' said the Racine
resident, who drove to Chicago with his father and lawyer to
present officials with his winning ticket from Saturday's 6 of 54
Lotto drawing.
   The windfall will not only allow him to quit his job, which pays
$9 to $10 an hour, but will give him more time to enjoy his
favorite pasttime, fishing. And it may lead to a new marital status.
   ``I realize this might change,'' the bachelor said.
   Hall said he wasn't yet sure how he would spend his winnings,
which will be spread over 20 years.
   He said he has played the Illinois lottery since it started in
1974, driving about 20 miles across the state line to buy $15 worth
of tickets every week. Wisconsin is starting its own lottery this
year.
   The largest single prize in the Illinois lottery was a $40
million payout in 1984.

   Down a dirt road, in the middle of a cow
pasture, people rummage through piles of clothes covering an acre
of land.
   But where did the clothing come from?
   ``Like the old saying, that's my business and not yours,'' said
Lee ``Red'' Wright, who owns the farm where the clothes are stored.
   Bargain-hunters climb atop the mounds of clothes that have been
piled in the pasture for about three weeks. They pay $5 to park,
then may haul off all the clothes they want for free, Wright said.
   Some said they found bargains, others said it was ``all junk.''
   Wright had little to say.
   ``It's good for people that's not too peculiar about what they
have,'' he said.
   He said he expects more shipments of clothes soon.
   ``There's some that's got tags on them. Whether they're new or
not, I don't know,'' he said. ``That's for you to judge for
yourself. I don't know, but they're good clothes, they're real good
clothes.''
   Anson County Sheriff Tommy Allen says he's been swamped with
questions, and is investigating.
   ``He's getting so much publicity that if it's not on the level,
he's sure enough going to have some problems,'' Allen said.

   After listening to a well-rehearsed pitch
from more than 100 schoolchildren, a House committee unanimously
approved legislation naming a long-extinct creature as
Pennsylvania's official state fossil.
   Armed with posters, a skit and speeches, second graders from
Valley Elementary School in Bensalem lobbied the House Committee on
Conservation to approve legislation Tuesday naming the phacops rana
as the state fossil.
   ``Phacops rana were kings of the ocean floor millions of years
ago,'' said 8-year-old Nicky Lepone, a spokesman for his 120
classmates.
   ``The phacops rana can be found in many areas of Pennsylvania,''
Lepone said, adding that the creature ``reminds us of Darth Vader
from `Star Wars.'''
   The committee passed the bill after committee Chairman Camille
George donned a scarf and sunglasses and toted an umbrella to help
the students demonstrate how fossils are formed by weather
conditions over millions of years. One of the children then
produced a fossilized phacops rana to show to the legislators.
   Teacher Tony O'Malley said his class discovered Pennsylvania
lacked a state fossil after a student heard a question about
another state's fossil on a television game show.

MORNING BRIEFING: EVERYONE IS AN EXPERT AT PICKING THIS GAME
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard the experts' Super Bowl predictions. Here is what some fans have
to say:
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Royko, columnist for the Chicago Tribune: "I don't like either team. I
can't stand any San Francisco team. The thought of San Francisco winning it,
you ruined my morning just asking me. I'm sick of San Francisco. If they win
the Super Bowl, all we'll hear . . . is that they're the team of the decade.
</P>
<P>
"And then Denver. Colorado and Denver and the Rocky Mountains and that wimpy
singer singing about Rocky Mountain high. Neither team deserves to be
champion."
</P>
<P>
 -- John Wooden, former UCLA basketball coach: "I think the 49ers will win
primarily because they have great balance on offense and defense. They're not a
one-man team, but they have one great player, one of the best ever -- Joe
Montana. Denver has a great player also in (John) Elway, but they don't have
that great balance. I would pick the 49ers because of Montana, but Elway can
score from any place at any time. 49ers by 10."
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerry Mathers, the Beaver: "The 49ers, because I went to school at Berkeley
and I've been following them for a long time. They deserve it . . . Montana is
great. Denver's a good team, but they just don't have it. 28-14."
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which state's high schools have produced the most players
participating in today's Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
Fast forward: CBS analyst Terry Bradshaw, on the possibility of a lopsided
victory by the 49ers: "If a game's a blowout, I turn it off, and I know the
public's like that. For instance, I watched about three quarters of the
Denver-Cleveland (AFC title) game and then went fishing. I had my wife tape the
Rams and 49ers, and when I got back and heard the score, I just threw it away."
</P>
<P>
No wake, please: Porter Wharton, a public relations consultant who has been
hired to coordinate Monday's "welcome home" events in Denver, on why a quiet
reception will be held instead of a parade if the Broncos lose: "The
organization has always appreciated the show of support from fans, but it's a
very difficult situation for everyone after (a loss). The players are very down
and very tired, and it's better to keep things low-key."
</P>
<P>
Bumper crop: Jesse Sapolu, 49er center, on why linemen should enjoy greater
longevity in the NFL than linebackers or running backs: "If you put two cars
about a foot apart and ram them against each other time after time, and then
you get two of the same kind of cars and put them 10 yards apart, and they ram
each other full speed, I think the two 10 yards apart wouldn't last as long."
</P>
<P>
Starting out small: How far has Mike Holmgren, the 49ers' offensive
coordinator, come in coaching? He started at Sacred Heart High in San
Francisco. Said Holmgren: "It's a small parochial school and I was helping out
a friend of mine as assistant coach. We lost our first 22 games."
</P>
<P>
Stare wars: The 49ers' Harris Barton on the difference between Coach George
Seifert and Seifert's predecessor, Bill Walsh: "Bill was like Darth Vader. You
never knew what he was thinking. He was always watching you. There were so many
things he was particular about, like keeping your shirt tucked in and not
cussing. There was definitely a dark side."
</P>
<P>
Burning bright: Seifert on former Raider Matt Millen, now with the 49ers: "He's
a leader. He's a Jack Reynolds-type player. He brings a certain pizazz and fire
to the game. He's totally into football."
</P>
<P>
Pleasure before business: CBS Radio's Jack Buck, who will cover the Super Bowl
for the 10th consecutive year: "Doing the game on radio is more fun; doing it
on television means more money."
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Of the 94 players, 13 played high school ball in California, 12
in Texas. The Broncos have eight former California high school players; the
49ers have eight former Texas schoolboy stars.
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: CBS analyst John Madden: "I think the Super Bowl is the ultimate
hang. And I enjoy hangs." GARR KLUENDER

<HL> Your Money Matters: Forget Stocks; Invest in George Patton, Old Lunch Boxes and 'Good Luck Charm' </HL>
<AUTHOR> Alexandra Peers (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   People considering an investment in collectibles these days might want to stick with something safe.

   Like Elvis Presley.

   Four and a half months after the stock market crash, new investors in the collectibles markets are skittish.
Buyers have become choosy and are staying on the sidelines.
"Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop," says George Lowry, president of Swann Galleries, a New York auction house.

   In such an environment, experts agree that a variety of items can be attractive for collectors with a speculative bent.
Some memorabilia linked to Mr. Presley, for example, consistently command high prices.
But the list of "caveat emptors" attached to such items is miles long.

   "Antiques and collectibles are really not investments," cautions Samuel Pennington, editor of Maine Antique Digest.
"The basic problem is you buy it retail and sell it wholesale."

   Here, with a warning that many of the people quoted have a financial interest in the items they're discussing, is what the experts see as good investments in the collectibles market.

   --AUTOGRAPHS: Since the stock market crash, collectors "are more selective," says James Lowe of James Lowe Autographs Ltd. in New York.

   Indeed, the value of simple autographs appears to be lessening in relation to what dealers call "content" material -- signed letters or papers relating to the famous person's life.
"As collectors get more sophisticated, it's terribly important" to have more than a signature, says Mr. Lowry of Swann Galleries.

   For example, an Abraham Lincoln signature might cost between $800 and $1,200, says Thomas Lingenfelter, president of Heritage Collector's Society, a Lansdale, Pa., dealership.
But last year, he notes, a collector paid $150,000 for a Lincoln speech about inventions that also featured his autograph.

   Looking to the future, material signed by George Patton and Martin Luther King Jr. is appreciating in value, says Mr. Lowe.
A routine letter by Mr. King with authenticated signature might sell for as much as $500.

   On the other had, Theodore Roosevelt seems to be on the way out.
Although his signatures are popular with collectors, they aren't that valuable because Roosevelt letters are widely available, says Mr. Lingenfelter.

   --RARE BOOKS: The rare-book market has been invigorated recently by the sales of material from the estate of Carrie Estelle Doheny, a Los Angeles philanthropist.
Her holdings, which included a first volume of the Gutenberg Bible and illuminated manuscripts, are being auctioned off over a two-year period by Christie's, a subsidiary of Christie's PLC of London.
Several items have already set record prices and garnered headlines world-wide.

   As in other markets for art and collectibles, Japanese buyers are putting upward pressure on prices.
"If you want to start a collection," even of such 20th-century authors as William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck, "you better have a lot of money," says William Self, a Los-Angeles-based producer who has an extensive collection of works by Charles Dickens.

   Also enjoying a surge or resurgence in popularity are Rudyard Kipling, literature by women and books on labor history.
Detective fiction -- from Fu Manchu novels by Sax Rohmer to Agatha Christie first editions -- are showing strength.

   Dealers point to John Updike works and novels by "beat" authors and poets -- such as Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac -- as the next hot markets.

   --POP CULTURE: To the traditional collectibles attributes, such as rarity and beauty of design, add an intangible "kitsch" or camp value that attracts members of the baby-boom generation.
Dealers say they have seen a surge in interest in popular-culture items, including Teddy bears, lunch boxes and board games based on 1950s and 1960s television shows -- a market niche that received respectability from a recent exhibition of board games at the Museum of the City of New York.

   The business is "heart-driven," says one collector, and doesn't always follow the laws of supply and demand.
For example, while many dealers readily admit that there is a glut of so-called Disneyana (memorabilia emblazoned with Walt Disney characters), collectors so love the characters that all but the most recent items continue to escalate in value.

   For those prone to long shots, collectibles that experts still consider undervalued include recent toys -- like Darth Vader figurines based on the "Star Wars" movies -- decorative telephones, and early-model televisions and personal computers.

   --"THE KING": Connoisseurs may scoff -- "some people don't think that's serious collecting," says Mr. Lowry, somewhat charitably -- but Elvis Presley memorabilia rank among the most swiftly appreciating collectibles in the country.
Says Mr. Lingenfelter, "Elvis collecting is hot stuff."

   Jerry Osborne, publisher of DISCoveries, a magazine for record collectors, says Mr. Presley is "the No. 1 most collectible artist in the world."
While selected Beatles albums in mint condition may fetch higher prices, 40 separate Elvis recordings are now worth a minimum of $1,000 each, he says.

   But unwary fans should note that seemingly minute features can make all the difference: A test version of Mr. Presley's 1962 hit "Good Luck Charm" that plays at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute is valued at $3,000; the standard 45-rpm version is worth about $15.

   As for Elvis trinkets and memorabilia, most valuable are posters and menus relating to Mr. Presley's last Las Vegas concerts and items made in the 1950s under the Elvis Presley Enterprises label, says Steven Templeton, contributing author of "Elvis Collectibles."
He says an Elvis Presley doll that sold for $3 in 1957 and $120 in 1978, would now fetch upward of $1,800 in mint condition.

   Mr. Templeton doesn't find that at all surprising.
After all, he says, "There's Elvis Presley, and then there's everybody else."

EX-DRUG DEALERS TELL OF MIAMI-TO-L.A. SHIFT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A yearlong campaign by West Coast law enforcement officials to spotlight a
shift in drug trafficking from Miami to Los Angeles -- and plead for more
federal assistance -- took a turn toward the theatrical Tuesday with testimony
by two former distributors.
</P>
<P>
Wearing bright red ski masks, the two men -- both now police informers -- were
marched behind a white screen to tell a state panel how some Colombian cocaine
importers began bypassing Miami.
</P>
<P>
"In 1985, I started losing business to the West Coast. . . . The Colombians
were preferring straight runs into the (California) desert," said a Florida
informer called "Tony Jones," his voice altered by an electronic device to
sound somewhat like Darth Vader's.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Hearing
</P>
<P>
The two men were witnesses at a hearing at a hotel near Los Angeles
International Airport before the Attorney General's Commission on Narcotics, a
group of law enforcement officials from around the state.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that 1989 should be the year Hollywood canceled 'Miami Vice,'
because 1989 will also be remembered as the year that Hollywood, really all of
Los Angeles, surpassed Miami as the cocaine capital of the United States," said
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who presided over the hearing.
</P>
<P>
It was a message that Van de Kamp and others have voiced repeatedly this year,
and with increasing frequency in anticipation of the Bush Administration's
anti-drug program.
</P>
<P>
* In January, federal and local drug agents announced that they had seized more
than $100 million in cash from drug dealers in Los Angeles in 1988 -- more than
in Miami. Federal Drug Enforcement Administration officials concluded that
while Miami remained the major import point for the cocaine, about 40% of the
drug entering the country was being shipped to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
* In April, top officials of the Los Angeles offices of several federal law
enforcement agencies joined the Board of Supervisors complaining that there was
an Eastern bias in allocation of federal drug-fighting resources. They called
for an infusion of federal funds and manpower similar to the one in 1982 that
led to the creation of a South Florida task force.
</P>
<P>
* On Aug. 3, a report released by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said Los
Angeles street gangs have formed alliances with the Colombian drug cartels and
are selling "crack" cocaine in every corner of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, Van de Kamp announced that he will seek $13 million from
the Legislature to hire more than 200 new state drug agents, analysts and
auditors effective Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, has also
proposed construction of an 8,000-bed prison camp in the desert for drug
offenders and creation of a state "anti-drug superfund" to distribute $1.7
billion over eight years to local law police and governments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Bonds
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, considered the front-runner to be the GOP
candidate in the 1990 gubernatorial race, has called for a $4-billion federal
bond program to fund the Bush anti-drug program, which will be unveiled in
September by drug czar William J. Bennett.
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said Tuesday that he has seen a draft of the plan and expects
California to get from $60 to $80 million, which he called "a drop in the
bucket, not enough." The day's hearing was designed, in part, "to get Bill
Bennett's attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tony," the Florida informant brought to the tightly guarded hearing, described
himself as an expert in technical details of transporting drugs -- knowing the
optimum weight of airplane shipments depending on the distance flown, for
instance, or the safest overland routes from Miami to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
He said bribes to Colombian officials were an accepted cost of doing business,
explaining, "If you do not pay off the Colombian air force, you will be shot
down on takeoff."
</P>
<P>
The cartel kingpins have "duffel bags full of cash" sitting around, he said,
and in one case "the rats ate over $1.5 million."
</P>
<P>
The second informant testifying from behind the screen, identified as "John
Smith," said he distributed about 10 kilograms of cocaine a week after getting
it from Colombians in Los Angeles, who brought it through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he stopped, he said, "I was arrested."
</P>
<P>
While California officials appealed for more federal assistance, two law
enforcement representatives from Miami cautioned them that the federal presence
there created problems as well.
</P>
<P>
Lewis Wilson, who oversees the Miami office of the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement, said federal agents arrived who were "outsiders . . . they
couldn't even find there way around," and were of little use for two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, interagency rivalry "existed then. It exists today," with
investigators from different groups often reluctant to share information.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he doesn't believe there has been a relocation of cocaine
traffickers from Miami to Los Angeles, but simply "an expansion of criminal
activity."

   AP Military Writer Susanne Schafer recently
traveled to Fort Hood with General Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of
staff, where elements of the 1st Cavalry and 2nd Armored Divisions
are preparing to ship out to Saudi Arabia. This is the second of
three reports.

<TEXT>
   Staff Sgt. Connie Martens barked out the
chemical weapons drill to her two-dozen charges, sweaty young Army
soldiers swathed head to toe in thick, green and black protective
gear.
   ``Blister agent ... usually not fatal. Possibility of liquid
use. ... We have the M2-58A1. ... Hold your breath, grab your
M2-58A1. At that time you will start decontaminating your skin.
Once you decontaminate your skin, no problem!'' Martens told her
troops in rat-a-tat style.
   Some 15,000 soldiers from two armored divisions at this
sprawling Texas fort will soon trade its rolling hills for the
sands of Saudi Arabia. And Iraq's Saddam Hussein might be their
next instructor in the dangers of chemical warfare.
   So the soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division listened intently
to the petite sergeant with the booming voice - a chemical weapons
expert with 15 years of service - as they got themselves and their
gear ready to deploy.
   ``Blisters may begin to appear on your skin. ... Don't pop the
blisters. If you break the blisters, you have the secondary problem
of infection. You don't want infections out there, so just keep 'em
covered like you've always been trained, like a normal burn
casualty and you won't have a problem. Any questions?'' she asked.
   ``Yeah, I've got a question,'' a voice sounded from the side of
the huddle. ``What's the standard for putting on a protective
mask?''
   Backs stiffened and eyes widened as a big-shouldered four-star
general in jungle green and brown fatigues worked his way to the
front of the group.
   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, had come to see
whether his troops were getting the proper training before being
sent in harm's way.
   ``Who knows?'' Vuono shouted at the group, soldiers who'd rarely
been quizzed by a multistar general, let alone the Army's top
commander.
   ``Nine seconds!'' came a chorused reply.
   ``So what's the signal?'' Vuono asked. Without waiting for a
response, he then boomed out: ``Gas! Gas! Gas!''
   Ripping their black headgear from their belts, the soldiers
squeezed their eyes shut add held their breath as they struggled to
place the heavy goggles and plastic cover over their heads.
   A few wouldn't have made it in time. Most did.
   ``Not bad, not bad,'' Vuono said, checking his watch. ``Let's
try it again. Put 'em back!''
   As a few men started to remove their clumsy headgear, the
muffled sound of ``Negative, negative'' emerged from the under the
Darth Vader-like hoods.
   Vuono beamed with delight - the soldiers had refused his order
because he'd not given the proper command ``All clear.''
   ``Well done! Well done! I tell you, Tilleli, I'm proud of these
guys!'' Vuono shouted to their commander, Maj. Gen. John Tilleli
Jr., who stood nearby.
   Leaning on his brown and green cane - the general had recently
undergone hip surgery so his staff had covered his hospital-issued
yellow cane with camouflage tape - Vuono told the soldiers they
were going a long way from Fort Hood, to a place much hotter than
Texas.
   And they also might have to go up against an opponent who has
used chemical weapons before.
   All hoods and goggles were still, trained on the general.
   ``I don't know whether he'll use them, I don't know whether
we'll fight him. All I do know is, I don't want any soldier going
to Saudi Arabia that isn't well trained,'' the general said.
   ``We're damn proud of each and every one of you, and we wish you
all the best and Godspeed as you deploy on Desert Shield,'' Vuono
said, saluting. ``Good luck. Good job.''
   ``Tet-Hup!'' came the command. As Vuono strode away, the
rubberized soldiers stood at attention under shade of the scrub
oak.
   Then with the speed of a bullet, Sgt. Martens was spouting her
commands again, getting her charges ready to move through the
training booth that simulates a chemical weapons attack.
   ``All right men, move to the next area, move to the CS area. If
you have any contacts, make sure you get 'em out. We don't want to
make you cry. Just a safety precaution, get 'em out.''

thing difficult to put into words. Just ask any kid who cajoled his or her

to the four dudes from the New York City sewers?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I don't know," says Blake Spiers, 6 1/2, of Salinas.;    "I don't know,"
says Mina Mousavi, 5, of Foster City.;    "Gee, I don't know," says Christin
Wood, 10, of Scotts Valley.;    "Because they're green?" asks Suzie Ramsour,
9, of Gustine.;    Excellent answer, Dudette!;    Suzie was one of hundreds of
three-foot tall humanoid ninjas who careened around the red-carpeted halls of
the CPA, which was about three-quarters full for the San Jose stop in the
Turtle's 40-city rock 'n' roll tour.;    The kids waved plastic Ninja swords.
They swung plastic Ninja "nunchuckas," two lethal looking bars connected by a
chain. Considering that everybody under age 10 was half-blinded by Ninja
masks, a Lone Ranger-like affair that tended to get its eye holes off-center,
it's a wonder more of the adults didn't end up in the bathrooms at
intermission, nursing bruised shins.;    Suzie's mask was orange. Why?
"Because I like Michaelangelo." Why? "Because he likes to spin around on his
shell.";    All right!;    It was Michaelangelo, after all, who allegedly got
the idea that he and his three mates -- Leonardo, Rafael and Donatello --
ought to branch out into the music business. Being Saturday morning cartoon
crime fighters, stars in their own feature film and the merchandising
sweethearts of everything from Ninja Turtle lunch boxes to Ninja Turtle
underwear was not enough. Music, the Turtles explained, is where it's at,
dudes and dudettes.;    Despite the brisk business in swords and nunchuckas
out in the lobby, the Turtles told their audience up front that violence is
not their way. At least, not unless their shells are really against the wall.;
   Sure, once during the show they inflicted some rough stuff on their arch
nemesis Shredder, a cross between Darth Vader and a top-of-the-line Osterizer
with the best maniacal laugh in the business.;    Shredder was on hand to
spice things up in case the tiny ninjas needed a story line between the
Turtle's songs. So was April, the shrill television reporter who documents the
Turtles' every move. It was April who fell into the clutches of Shredder, who
planned to rid the world of music with his "deharmonic convergence" machine.;
  Between trying to rescue April and returning music to the world, the Turtles
managed to perform a number of songs off their album, which sold two million
copies within three months of its release last fall.;    The Turtles
good-naturedly took a stab at everything -- surfer music, ballads, even rap
with "M.C. Angelo" -- and somehow, they managed to sing and play their guitars
while going through choreographed moves that would test the skills of Paula
Abdul, especially if she were wearing a couple of dozen pounds of Turtle
suit.;    There were even some jokes for the parents thrown in. Band leader
Michaelangelo can't stop himself from saying, "Thank you! We love you! Thank
you!" long after the applause has stopped, ala '70s rock stars. He is
possessed by the spirit of Elvis Presley, and there's even a sly mention of
the real Turtles, the ones from the '60s.;    The production was a high-tech
one, too, with plenty of puddles of green and purple light for the Turtles to
dance into and out of, huge banks of television monitors on both sides of the
stage, and a sound system that boomed out Turtle music so clearly you could
almost always make out the lyrics, just in case the five-year-old beside you
wasn't screaming along.;    But, when it was all over, what was Suzie
Ramsour's favorite part?;    "When April lost her voice.";    Yeah. That was a
good part.  </TEXT>

JACK MATHEWS: THE PROBLEM WITH UNIVERSAL'S 'PROBLEM CHILD'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The marketing staff at Universal Pictures must have had a lot of fun writing
the blurbs for its ad campaign for "Problem Child" -- for about 10 minutes
anyway. How long could it have taken to come up with such howlers as " 'Two
Thumbs Up!' -- Captain Hook"? or " 'I Wish He Were My Son' -- Darth Vader"? or
" 'A 10+! Junior Had Me in Stitches!' -- Frankenstein"?
</P>
<P>
The gag blurbs are just about as inspired as the movie, so, in that sense,
there is truth in advertising. And no one can say they haven't been effective;
during its first 10 days in release, "Problem Child" picked willing American
moviegoers' pockets for about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
Universal has succeeded with "Problem Child" without the benefit of opening-day
reviews or pre-release publicity. The movie was not screened in advance for
critics, a decision that is the equivalent of an in-house pan, and the only
publicity for it came from animal rights groups protesting its apparent abuse
of cats. A poster for "Problem Child" showed a panicked cat whirling in a
front-load dryer, and the trailer showed a cat walking gingerly on splintered
broken legs.
</P>
<P>
In both instances, the implication was that the movie's title character (the
screenwriters dub the story a "comic 'Bad Seed' ") tortured cats as part of his
general run of terror.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's anything funny about abusing animals," says Kathy
Novelli, of San Francisco-based In Defense of Animals, which is planning more
protests against "Problem Child." "Kids are very impressionable. They see a cat
in a dryer and say, 'Hey, that's a great idea.' It's giving kids ideas they
don't need."
</P>
<P>
The dryer scene is not actually in the movie and never was, according to studio
sources, which makes the marketing department guilty of deception as well as
bad taste. Novelli says her group has been successful in getting some theaters
to take down the poster, but check your local multiplex; the kitty-in-the-dryer
poster is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
There is a cat shown in the movie high-stepping across a lawn with his paws
bandaged (cats hate it when that happens) and among the millions of kids who
are exposed to the sight gag, some will undoubtedly try it at home with Boots.
A few, as Novelli fears, may even put theirs in a dryer. But this film could be
doing much greater harm than that in its indirect exploitation of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
Junior, a 7-year-old who had been shuffled from home to home is presented in
the film as a satanic mischief-maker who is ultimately redeemed by the patience
of the Super Dad (John Ritter) who adopts him. Along the way to salvation,
however, Junior is the perfect devil -- setting fires, bombing birthday cakes,
tormenting his cat, nearly killing his adoptive grandfather. (Are your sides
aching yet?)
</P>
<P>
It is a dark coincidence, and probably one reason why Universal dumped "Problem
Child" on the market without preview press screenings, that HBO aired the
documentary "Child of Rage" just weeks earlier. "Child of Rage" focused on an
adopted girl named Beth who, her unsuspecting adoptive parents quickly learned,
was self-destructive and homicidal. She tormented the family dog, killed some
baby birds and attempted to kill her younger brother. In therapy, it was
learned that she had been severely abused by her natural father and had come to
believe that though she was not OK, her behavior was.
</P>
<P>
"Hers was a serious case, but nothing about it was unusual," says Anne Cohn,
executive director of the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse,
and a consultant on "Child of Rage." "Children who are abused most often will
have a tremendous rage and sense of insecurity."
</P>
<P>
Cohn says she is "appalled" at the theme of "Problem Child" and thinks the
flipness with which people approach child abuse is doing harm by suggesting the
behavior depicted is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"I'm reminded of a little cartoon on an air-freshener package showing (Bart)
Simpson being strangled by his father," Cohn says. "It's meant to be funny, but
the strangling of children by their parents (occurs) and it's not funny."
</P>
<P>
As it happens, there's a scene in "Problem Child" where the fed-up adoptive dad
slips into Junior's room at one point and briefly considers smothering him with
a pillow. It gets a big laugh every time.
</P>
<P>
Cohn puts "Problem Child" in a class with the popular TV show "America's
Favorite Home Videos," which she says seems to encourage child abuse. "People
think these videos are hilarious, but what they often show are parents setting
their children up for disaster. Humor can help us make light of ourselves, but
I don't think that's what ('Problem Child') is doing. It's making fun of a
victim."
</P>
<P>
Jeri Ryan, a child psychologist in San Francisco, says that children often
abuse pets because in exercising control over something that can't fight back
it fills -- in a false way -- a need for power. She's concerned that "Problem
Child" can be suggesting that kind of behavior to abused children.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing that abuse taken lightly gives permission to behave the same way; it
idealizes it," Ryan says. "Children don't see the finality of things. Imagine
the guilt they would feel if they put an animal in a dryer and it was harmed or
died."
</P>
<P>
Other experts in adoption services fear the fallout from the film's suggestion
that adopting older children is more of a risk than it actually is. The
majority of older adopted children are, in fact, abused children, and, if the
problems aren't worked out, these experts agree, the kids do internalize guilt
and often express it as acted-out rage. But they say these problems have been
worked through before a child is put up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
Executives at Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment, a production company that had
courted an image as a maker of family theme films before this dubious
enterprise, were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
And, by the way, for those who think the movie rating system works, "Problem
Child" is rated PG.

MORNING BRIEFING: ALI REMEMBERS THE COLORS, BUT NOT 10-YEAR-OLD TYSON
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali appeared on Arsenio Hall's show last week, the
New York Times said Tyson revealed that when he was 10 years old and doing time
in a Bronx detention center, Ali visited the facility.
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he didn't get to meet Ali.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get close to him," Tyson said. "I was one of the troublemakers in
the back."
</P>
<P>
"I remember you," Ali said. "You were the one in the brown pants and the yellow
shirt."
</P>
<P>
"Oh, wow." Hall said, marveling at Ali's memory.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had brown pants and yellow shirts," Tyson said. "It was the
uniform."
</P>

Out of the dark: Tackle Harris Barton of the San Francisco 49ers, asked to
compare new Coach George Seifert to Bill Walsh, told the Oakland Tribune:
"George is a players' coach. Bill was like Darth Vader. You never knew what he
was thinking. He was always watching you. There were so many things he was
particular about, like keeping your shirt tucked in, not cussing. There was a
definite dark side there.
</P>
<P>
"George, though, is really pleasant. We don't have to be scared walking through
the hallways limping. This is definitely a different feeling."

enjoy a lot of advantages playing in Italy, but warned: "When you play away

million-dollar American, be prepared for nothing short of guerrilla warfare.

"Referees will be cowed into whistling you for fouls if you come close to
breathing on an opponent. Maniacal fans have been known to heat up 100-lira
coins with their cigarette lighters and toss them at the American star. When
the crowd runs out of change, burning cigars and cigarettes may rain down on
you -- especially if you are causing their team to lose."

Ho-hum: From Tom Friend of the Washington Post, trying to explain the
infrequent appearances of Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke at league meetings:
"Apparently they bore him. League officials remember the year he attended one

their players didn't pull up their socks -- then left in a huff. As it turned
out, he bought the Chrysler Building that afternoon."

ED ASNER IS USED TO BEING THE STAR.
BUT THIS TV SEASON, HE'S EXCITED ABOUT A
SUPPORTING ROLE:
AS ROSIE O'NEILL'S OWN LOU GRANT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The New Season  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   IT'S midmorning on the set of CBS's "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," the film
is rolling and we find Rosie, played by double Emmy winner Sharon Gless,
positively radiating happiness as she flirts over the telephone with her new
boyfriend.;   Obviously, things are looking up this season for the usually
unlucky-in-love and much put-upon public defender. Or are they?;   Suddenly,
an ominous bulk looms in the doorway of Rosie's office and her smile instantly
wilts as she looks into the surly puss of . . . Ed Asner?;   That's right, the
seven-time Emmy-winning star of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Lou Grant" and a
slew of other shows has joined Rosie's team this fall as her official
tormentor, starting with tonight's season premiere of "The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill," which introduces Asner as ex-cop Walter Kovatch, new investigator
for the Los Angeles public defender's office.;   "I'm like Ollie North doing
community service," says Asner about the role. "Kovatch has no time for public
defenders. He thinks they're full of crap most of the time, always pushing to
put the wrong people back on the street.";   And, since Rosie O'Neill is the
living embodiment of "bleeding heart" legal liberalism, Asner's character is
her personal Darth Vader.;   "As I see it," he says, "my job is to keep
popping her balloon.";   Which is exactly what he was doing that morning, over
and over again in take after take as Kovatch turns in a startling
investigation report that wins Rosie's grudging admiration.;   "Keep this up,
Kovatch," says Rosie, "and I may have to pay you a compliment.";
"Considering the source," he snarls, "who cares?";   If Rosie O'Neill were
Mary Richards, that would be the cue for her to groan: "Oh, Mr. Grant!" But
Rosie O'Neill has been insulted by the best, so she just shakes her head sadly
as Kovatch exits rudely.;   "I love taking the potshots," Asner explains a few
minutes later in his motor home/dressing room, the air conditioner turned up
to max in a futile attempt at relief from the 100-plus-degree heat outside.
For those who remember how "mean" he used to be to poor Mary, Asner promises,
"they ain't seen nothin' yet. Lou Grant was a marshmallow compared to this
guy.";    It may seem strange to some that Asner has signed on for what's
clearly a supporting role in "Rosie O'Neill." Asner moved up to leading roles
in 1977 when his Lou Grant character was spun out of "The Mary Tyler Moore
Show" into a show of his own. He remained in starring roles in his two
subsequent shows, ABC's "Off the Rack" and NBC's "The Bronx Zoo.";   Asner
doesn't see it as any kind of comedown. He has always been a character actor
and he believes Kovatch is a priceless character, even if he isn't the star of
the show. He thinks Kovatch is comparable to Ves Painter, the colorful and
thoroughly obnoxious character the late Warren Oates played on ABC's 1962
"Stoney Burke" series.;   "He was a scumbag who was selling out his friends
week after week," Asner recalls. "Warren played him admirably.";   Asner also
reminds us that the "workhorses" of his "Lou Grant" series were "Rossi"
(Robert Walden) and "Billie" (Linda Kelsey), not the Lou Grant character.;
"It was only his aura that worked," says Asner. "More often than not, I'd work
just three days out of a seven-day schedule.";   It's also widely believed
that Asner is being handsomely compensated for coming into "The Trials of
Rosie O'Neill" at the behest of Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment,
to help the show fight what's expected to be a brutal ratings battle against
NBC's 9 o'clock show, "Cheers," TV's No. 1 prime-time show last season.;
"It's nice to be thought of as the star of the show, the numero uno," says
Asner, "but I have all the other perks for doing this.";   Barney Rozensweig,
executive producer of "Rosie" and Gless' real-life husband, had wanted to
bring Asner into the show when it began last season, but the deal couldn't be
put together. He always saw the dramatic potential in giving Rosie a
high-profile adversary like Kovatch.;   Yet there may be still another reason
why Asner came to terms this fall. His last two prime-time series were flops
and Asner freely admits his outspokenly liberal politics and his
controversy-plagued duty as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in the
1980s have hurt his chances for roles.;   "I wound up embroiled in some
terrible controversies that cost me," Asner says.;   (Among them: His
outspoken criticism of U.S. support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, which
provoked feuding within the union membership, and his tough line on labor
negotiations.);   "Last year was not a good year," he admits, not in terms of
earnings, recognition, nor "the people who will take my calls.";   Though he
says his season of public activism is "over and done with now," Asner still
believes he gained more than he lost by becoming a union leader in the 1980s.
He isn't at all bitter about the lingering impact on his career.;   "The
education I've received in the last 10 years has been so priceless, so
magnificent," he says. "I wouldn't take a million dollars to go through it
again, but I wouldn't take a million dollars to (erase) it either. It has
given me such honor that it was more than worth it.";   Still, there's a
certain humor in finding such a well-known liberal as Asner playing a
reactionary character in a weekly drama with as liberal a bent as "The Trials
of Rosie O'Neill." Asner also finds it amusing -- and hopes there'll be no
effort to "warm" up Kovatch or turn him into something "nice.";   In the
story, Kovatch joins the public defender's office essentially as a condition
of probation after he leaves the police force, gets into trouble and winds up
in jail, being defended by, of all people, Rosie O'Neill. Naturally, she wants
to redeem him by putting him to work in her office.;   Though he'll never grow
fond of Rosie, Asner says Kovatch probably is "developing an awareness of her
fumbling efforts to do right.";   And if his Kovatch character can help
increase the public's awareness of "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" at the same
time, says Asner, "he'll be doing just fine."  </TEXT>

FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: Grand carnage - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow's men's singles final of the 114th US Championships at the National
Tennis Centre, Flushing Meadow, will produce a new champion. That much, at
least, is certain at the end of a fortnight when upsets have abounded. Who
we shall be hailing as he holds aloft the famous silver cup and pockets a
cheque worth Dollars 550,000 is difficult to predict.
In today's semi-finals, the 1991 Wimbledon champion, Michael Stich of
Germany, seeded No 4, will play unseeded Karel Novacek of the Czech
Republic, ranked 56, in the top half. In the lower half, Andre Agassi,
unseeded for the first time since 1987, will play fellow American Todd
Martin, seeded No 9.
When Jaime Yzaga beat Pete Sampras, the defending champion, on Tuesday it
meant that for the first time since tennis went open in 1968, only three of
the seeds had reached the quarter-finals: Stich, Martin, and the left-handed
Austrian, Thomas Muster (13). Once again, the growing depth in the men's
game was apparent.
The carnage had begun early. Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic (2) fell at
the first hurdle to the German giant Markus Zoecke whose serve is nearly as
big as his own. 'Maybe it's a brain injury. As soon as I come here it is
finished. It's not a problem with New York, it's a problem with me,' said
Ivanisevic.
Boris Becker (7), also lost in the first round, beaten by America's Richey
Reneberg. The 1989 champion was disappointed. 'I thought I had a good
chance,' said Becker. 'But it was extremely slow this year - both the court
and the heavier, softer balls.' Almost as slow as Becker himself, one might
have added.
Another former US Open winner, fifth seeded Stefan Edberg (1991, 1992), fell
in the third round to fellow Swede and frequent practice partner, Jonas
Bjorkman. The match was played at night in the same cold, windy conditions
that had prevailed when Edberg lost to Aaron Krickstein in 1988. Thus, for
the first year since 1986, Edberg has failed to reach a Grand Slam final. He
was the victim of his own frailty on serve and an inspired piece of
attacking play from Bjorkman who had given notice of his advance by beating
French Open champion Sergi Bruguera two weeks ago in Schenectady.
Bruguera had performed well at Flushing Meadow until he was hammered into
submission by Muster in the fourth round.
Michael Chang, the sixth seed, believes that he is at his best on the
surface. He proved it, too, in one of the best matches of the tournament
when he faced Agassi in the fourth round. It was a full-blooded contest. The
quality of shot-making from both men was remarkable, the result a tonic for
a sport that badly needs the survival of characters like Agassi.
If, at times, Agassi's sinister black cap, black, white and blue striped
shirt, plus black socks and shoes, makes him look more like Darth Vader than
a tennis player as he darts about firing bullets from his light-sabre of a
racket, one can still admire his astonishing timing and his courage in going
for his shots.
Whether Martin will be cast in the role of Luke Skywalker this afternoon
remains to be seen. Certainly the tall, upright, all-American boy has done
well to survive after saving three match points against Guillaume Raoux of
France in the first round. He is carrying a groin injury that inhibits his
movement and is playing well below the form that took him to the final of
the Australian Open in January and the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Yet he will
start as favourite. Martin has won three of his five matches against Agassi.
At a time when the age eligibility rules for women are being redefined to
protect the young from burn out and exploitation, Steffi Graf, herself an
infant prodigy when she began, will be defending her title today against the
22-year-old from Spain, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. The great rivalry that is
developing between these two - Graf leads 24-7 but has lost two of their
last three meetings after holding match points in both - is about the only
thing that is holding the women's game together. Already, the shortage of
quality performers has brought a restlessness among the tournament promoters
and some of the leading players. Together with the International Management
Group they are proposing a revamped circuit with fewer tournaments.

<LEADPARA>  THE PRICES of stylish sneakers have already soared past $100. And now
sunglasses have joined them on the high-profile, high-priced stage.;   You

Darth Vader-type sunglasses are in.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sports specialty-shop managers say they sell as quickly as they can be
stocked.;   It's not just Henderson and his baseball pals who are wearing
them. It seems track and field athletes, skiers, cyclists, surfers and runners
all have gotten in the act.;   Although they sell for $70 to $130, a high
price doesn't guarantee safety or utility.;   "There are only two concerns
with sunglasses," said Dr. Ted Lawwill, an ophthalmology professor at the
University of Kansas and a member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
"One, will they break and cut your eye? The FDA has some control over that.
The second question is what kind of light it lets through.";   Invisible
ultraviolet light is the most damaging to the eye.;   "Light ages the eyes
just like it does the skin," Lawwill said.;   Here's what to look for when
purchasing sunglasses:;   (check) Check the label or manufacturer's booklet to
be sure that the sunglasses block 100 percent of ultraviolet light.;   (check)
Check the label or manufacturer's booklet to be sure that the sunglasses have
passed an impact test and are shatter-resistant.;   Kris Bowers, the
advertising director for Oakley, a company that makes the wraparound
sunglasses, said Oakleys offer 100 percent UV protection and that they are
made with polycarbonic lenses, a hard, plastic-like material.;   "There's no
way you could have a glass lens," she said. "If you crash or fall, you'd have
glass in your face.";   In addition to safety and fashion, consumers --
particularly cyclists -- are concerned about wind.;   "They want the wind out
of their eyes," said Mike Keyser, who works at a ski shop in Fremont and owns
a pair of the sunglasses. "In skiing it's the same idea.";   Because the
sunglasses' lens are wider and wrap around the face, wind is blocked.;
"They're optically correct, too," Miller said. "There's no distortion. There's
no part of the lens that you can see. You get a full view.";   Bowers admitted
the shades have appeal because they have become fashionable, but she insisted
that they are more than just a fad.;   "It's not just a fashion statement,"
she said. "It's a piece of equipment. They're used by runners, snowboarders,
surfers . . . in almost any sport you can name, really.";   Other companies
produce high-quality sunglasses as well, but shop managers said Oakley's
shades are the most popular.;   "They're always coming out with new colors,"
said Steve Miller, the manager of a Newark bike shop and an owner of a pair of
Oakleys. "They don't sit on their butts.";   But there's one thing Miller said
he doesn't understand: why some people are willing to spend so much on a
product that used to go for less than 20 bucks.;   "I sometimes wonder why
people go out and spend $100 on them," Miller said. "But then women go out and
buy Gucci bags, so . . ."  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  See also related article on page 12 of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     These are 21 players from history who will win it for us.;   We're going to
need all 21 of them, because in hockey there's a constant shifting of
personnel -- players skate for a minute or so, then sit down for a short rest
while fresh troops take over.;   The game will be played in the sport's most
renowned arena, the Forum, in Montreal, the city where organized modern ice
hockey began (on Earth) on March 3, 1875.;   First unit. Center: Wayne Gretzky
(1978 to present). Easily the best player in the world in the 1980s; he's
fading just a bit now but is still well worth seeing in person. He's a slim
guy who always looks like he's going to get rubbed out by some ice gangster,
but he slips away and gets his revenge by scoring. Among his many gifts is his
exceptional eyesight -- his peripheral vision has been tested at 30 percent
better than average. Also, he has a gift for actually having fun out there.;
Wings: Gordie Howe (1946-80) and Valeri Kharlamov (Soviet, 1960s-70s). Howe's
peak seasons came when Truman was president, and he was still scoring goals in
the year Reagan was elected. Kharlamov, at his best, was one of the two or
three top forwards in the world, but North American fans rarely got to see
him. This sort of thing will be happening less and less in coming years -- the
NHL today is getting lots of fine European and Soviet players; someday,
Soviets and Europeans will lead a team to the Stanley Cup.;   Defense: Bobby
Orr (1966-79) and Valeri Vasiliev (Soviet, 1970s-80s). An "offensive-minded"
defenseman is usually paired with a "defensive-minded" one. Orr refined the
concept of the offensive defenseman into an art. In his best years, he
regularly took the puck in his zone, in the space behind his goalie, and made
magnificent rink-length solo rushes to score. No one could touch him because
he was so fast and shifty. He also was a skilled passer. And he was no slouch
as a defender. Vasiliev excelled at the most important job of the defensive
defenseman -- dominating the few square yards of space directly in front of
his goalie, the key defensive combat zone, where no prisoners are taken.;
Goalie: Jacques Plante (1952-73). Great during the regular season and better
during the playoffs.;   Second unit. Center: Howie Morenz (1923-37). Wings:
Maurice Richard (1942-60) and Mike McPhee (1983-present). Three great
forwards; also, three great Montreal Canadiens -- and since we're playing in
the Forum, we want the crowd inflamed. There is nothing in sports like the
sound of 16,197 Quebecois cheering for their heroes.;   Defense: Viacheslav
Fetisov (Soviet and NHL, 1970s-present) and Eddie Shore (1926-40). Shore was
the Ty Cobb of hockey -- extremely cranky, and unsurpassed.;   Third unit. In
many games, it's the play of "special teams" that makes the difference: the
"power play" unit (when our side can put more skaters on the ice than theirs,
because one or two of their guys have been sent to the penalty box) and the
"penalty-killing" unit (when we've been penalized). For our power play, we'll
draw from the first two units, above. For our penalty killers, we choose:
Forwards: Bob Gainey (1973-89), who rarely scored a goal but was one of the
best defensive-minded forwards ever; and Mario Lemieux (1984-present), today's
premier player, for the Penguins, whose breakaways while killing penalties
(where he steals the puck and storms down the rink all alone) are feats of
beauty and scholarship. Defense: Doug Harvey (1947-69) and Ray Bourque
(1979-present).;   Back-up goalies: Vladislav Tretiak (Soviet, 1970s-80s) and
Frankie "Mr. Zero" Brimsek (1938-50).;   Bench strength. Anatoli Firsov
(Soviet, 1960s-70s); Bobby Hull (1957-80); and Bobby Clarke (1969-84). Also,
designated fighter Dave Schultz (1971-80), because as long as the league
allows fighting, we'd better get on the bandwagon and have a thug we can call
our own.;   Coach: Herb Brooks, who in 1980 revolutionized the game by
combining two styles of play -- North American grittiness and European
creativity and finesse -- to produce the gold medal-winning U.S. Olympians.
Adviser: Soviet pioneer Anatoli Tarasov.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   They may not rank up there with the works
of Picasso or Matisse, but Michael Angelo Vidal Jr.'s Etch-A-Sketch
masterpieces are drawing rave reviews at the Burbank Central
Library.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Michael Lewis as he gazed at an
elaborate drawing of a knight battling a scaly dragon outside a
brick medieval castle. ``I've been doing Etch-A-Sketch since I was
little and all I can draw is a face.''
   While the art world reels from an insatiable demand for big-name
creations such as ``Yo Picasso,'' the self-portrait which recently
sold for $47 million, the visionary Vidal is plotting a new
artistic course.
   Equipped with a standard toy-store-issue Etch-A-Sketch, Vidal
meticulously moves the horizontal and vertical knobs on the red
5-by-7 inch ``magic screen'' filled with metallic powder.
   Soon, Voila! The little black squiggle that has kept kids quiet
in the back seat for three decades becomes another Vidal Original.
   Michael Angelo Vidal (and that's his real name) wasn't always an
accomplished Etch-A-Sketcher.
   ``It was always easy for me to draw complicated work. I thought
I could get into any medium _ pencils, paint, oil. But here was
this Etch-A-Sketch and I couldn't get it to work for a darn,'' said
Vidal, 38, of Burbank.
   But the freelance carpenter and artist mastered the
Etch-A-Sketch so it now takes him 15 minutes to draw a portrait,
although up to 25 hours for a more complex work. He said he has
bought several hundred of the toys over the years, and several of
the drawings on display are more than a decade old.
   ``I've sold several pieces of artwork _ anywhere from eight to
10 of them _ mostly to friends and acquaintances,'' he said.
   ``It's unique. I get more response out of this medium. You have
to use two hands to use this. It's a toy, and everyone is aware of
this toy. And I can carry it with me.''
   Although his pictures of a housing development, reptiles, the
Beatles and Darth Vader haven't yet made it to the Louvre or the
National Gallery of Art, the sketchings are prompting open-mouth
amazement at the Burbank library, where they are on sale at prices
ranging from $200 to $5,000.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Bill Kahikina, repeating a common
utterance by viewers of the Etch-A-Sketch art. ``All I could do is
draw a square.''
   The etchings are exhibited flat in a glass case, propped up ever
so slightly because of the delicate nature of the toy. The board
erases when it is shaken or turned over _ a feature that's nice for
kids, potentially disastrous for Vidal.
   Once, he recalled, he had to brake sharply in his car and an
Etch-A-Sketch fell off the seat. ``It was a loss,'' Vidal said.
   Special care will be taken next month when the Vidal etching
collection is moved down the street for its next engagement at the
Brand Art and Music Library in nearby Glendale. Could the Los
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art be next?
   Etch-A-Sketch went on the market in 1960 for $2.98. It has
become one of the most popular children's toys ever, having sold
more than 50 million since its introduction and continuing to sell
about 2 million a year at its current $8.99 cost, said Lowell
Wilson, vice president of development and marketing for The Ohio
Art Co., which manufactures the toy.
   ``We're now into our third generation of Etch-A-Sketch. Mothers
bought them for their children and now those children are mothers
buying it for their children,'' Wilson said.
   Vidal is not alone in his hobby. Wilson said there is an
Etch-A-Sketch art club with 25,000 members. Most are children
between 3 and 10 years old, but there are also many adult members
who are accomplished etchers.
   ``These people are amazing,'' Wilson said. ``People have
detailed Mount Rushmore, detailed dollar bills. It's definitely an
art form.''
   Vidal couldn't agree more.
   ``There's a technique to it. It has great detail. You have to be
an artist to draw them,'' he said. ``I do consider it serious art.''

COWBOYS' NEW ERA STARTS OFF SLOW
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Tex Schramm received a phone call from Don Shula in the early morning last
Feb. 24, he knew a run of football like none other was about to end. His team,
America's Team to many, soon would belong to someone else.
</P>
<P>
Schramm, Tom Landry and Gil Brandt never owned the Dallas Cowboys. All they did
was nurture them, from expansion birth in 1960, into as consistently fine a
team as anything in sport.
</P>
<P>
Under Schramm, the investment of the original owner, Clint Murchison Jr., grew
from $550,000 to $83 million. Under Schramm, the investment of the second
owner, Bum Bright, grew in five years from $83 million to $140 million.
</P>
<P>
Schramm surely sensed from his conversation with Shula that the third owner,
Jerry Jones, would be running the shop himself. The call was to inform Schramm
that Jimmy Johnson was making hush-hush inquiries about hiring Shula's son
David as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
So the deal was done after all. Without Schramm's knowledge, Jones had bought
the Cowboys and hired his own man, Johnson, as coach. A day later, Landry
officially was gone. Then Schramm. Finally, after he'd helped with the draft,
Brandt was fired.
</P>
<P>
Jones admitted to a huge public-relations fumble in not telling Landry his fate
until everybody else knew it. (Schramm actually broke the news, calling Landry
off the golf course. True to character, Landry continued the round. Whether his
score went up or down was not reported.)
</P>
<P>
"I guess," Jones said, "I'll always be thought of as the Darth Vader in this
situation."
</P>
<P>
Mostly in such football changes of command, matters quickly fade, if not
totally pass away. New management assumes control. Locks are changed, if
necessary, and the old guard slinks into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
Not with the Cowboys. Not with Schramm, who has been such a forceful -- and
public -- figure in the National Football League for more than four decades.
Not with Landry, who in the mid-'50s devised a defense (the 4-3) still popular
and who eventually may be regarded as the league's premier coach of all time.
</P>
<P>
Such was the swift and scathing reaction to Jones and Johnson that a book ("The
Landry Legend: Grace Under Pressure") reveals the relevant details of their
takeover.
</P>
<P>
To opponents, the on-the-field read so far this season seems pleasant enough.
What Redskins fans ought to enjoy watching today in Texas Stadium, besides
victory for their guys, is at quarterback and in the owners box. Troy Aikman is
as gifted as advertised, accurate on long and short passes. And tough.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers in exhibition season tried to scramble Aikman's mind and tarnish his
first-in-the-draft reputation, with three blitzes from the strong safety and
one from a cornerback. Down four times, the rookie bounced up unfazed.
</P>
<P>
Two regular-season games have seemed enough for football sophisticates in
Dallas to sense that Aikman is for real and lots of those around him are not.
Possibly to direct attention elsewhere when the Cowboys defense is summoned to
duty, Jones has arranged for Elizabeth Taylor to be among his guests.
</P>
<P>
In truth, Schramm, Landry and Brandt did not leave much more than Herschel
Walker and a reputation even Johnson probably cannot negotiate into more than a
a couple of victories this season.
</P>
<P>
For three years, the Cowboys had been in serious decline, suffering their first
losing season in 22 years in 1986 and earning the rights to Aikman with a
worst-in-the-league 3-13 in '88. It took a little longer, but The Cycle also
had nailed the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
The other wondrous teams of the 1970s, the Raiders, Dolphins and Steelers, also
had suffered from the combination of poor position in the draft, harder
schedules and less-obvious factors that erode success in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
Dallas had avoided that, with players-for-high-draft-choices trades that
brought Too Tall Jones, Randy White and Tony Dorsett. Partly because of
injuries, Dorsett in 1977 was the last spectacular high-round draftee.
</P>
<P>
If the Cowboys under Landry in 1989 had been no more successful than the
Cowboys under Landry in 1988, Schramm would have been faced with a decision
Jones allowed him to avoid.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it all was the best thing that could have happened to Tom and myself,"
Schramm told author Bob St. John. "It might have happened a little too quickly,
but as it turned out Tom had an opportunity to go out with a lot of class and
with people showing a lot of feeling for him. He became a hero again to
everybody, even to those who had been so critical of him. . . . And with both
of us gone, it closed out an era."
</P>
<P>
Many who earlier thought Johnson drafted well are not so sure. The coach said:
"I don't want to deal in maybes." Yet of all the rookies on a bad team, only
Aikman has been able to crack the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien will be pleased to know that the Saints' Bobby
Hebert (16 for 19) and the Falcons' Chris Miller (21 for 29) were close to
unerring against the Dallas defense. At 38, Too Tall Jones is a reminder of how
Doomsday can turn to Gloomsday.
</P>
<P>
Aikman has been intercepted four times in two games. But three of those were
up-for-grabs throws near halftime or the end of games and another occurred when
the receiver on a timing pattern slipped. Johnson having discovered Walker in
the second game will be helpful, surely a reason the sloppy-tackling Redskins
are only favored by less than a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
After a 3-1 exhibition season, most Cowboys fans and many Cowboys officials and
players were hopeful. Still, a conversation in the clubhouse indicated optimism
was not rampant.
</P>
<P>
"Hey," said one player, "we get to play Green Bay twice this season."
</P>
<P>
"In Green Bay," said another, "they're saying: 'We get to play Dallas twice.' "

<HEADLINE>  THEIR FAST SUCCESS? IT'S 'UNBELIEVABLE'
EMF HAS A DANCE-POP HIT AND A BRIGHT MUSICAL
FUTURE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  MUSIC  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Except for No. 4, from whose bowels may be heard a din quite the equal of
the enthusiastic metal-bashing echoing the length of the rest of the street.
It's the sound of Great Britain's latest pop sensation rehearsing -- a
sensation likened by Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant to the Sex Pistols, and a
sensation ripe for export to America.;    EMF is the name, a rock-dance
quintet determined to add theirs to the modest list of star names -- Brian
Jones is one -- who hail from this picturesque and therefore very un-rock 'n'
rollish nook of Olde Englande.;    The fast road up;  "It's got a bit of
history, Cinderford has, but it's more famous for EMF than for anything
before," says keyboardist Derry Brownson, 20, about their hometown. "We've
still got friends there, but we know for a fact that we don't owe them
anything. They've never done anything for us. We've given the town
everything.";    Standing for Epson Mad Funkers (Epson computers, that is,
heavily advertised on British TV), EMF has sprung from nowhere to
international success in just over a year. Formed in October 1989, the band
was signed to EMI Records the following May after being spotted at only their
fourth gig.;    Five months later, their debut single, "Unbelievable," went
British Top 5, followed by two more hits and now an album, "Schubert Dip."
What they're rehearsing for now is their tour. (EMF brings its show to San
Francisco Saturday, at the Warfield. On Monday, they will give a free concert
at Stanford.);    Like father, like what?;  Shrinking violets they ain't.;
"My dad owned two nightclubs," Derry says, "and I remember my uncle playing
guitar in our living room when he was stoned out of his head. But my dad's got
no musical ability at all. And I don't think I have.";    Then there's
20-year-old bassist Zac (Zachary Sebastian Rex James) Foley (Derry: "I think
Zac's dad did a lot of acid in his hippie days. He's an artist, a pretty cool
bloke"), singer James Atkin, 22 ("His dad used to play banjo and guitar with
Miles of the Wonder Stuff's dad in a folk band"), and drummer Mark Decloedt,
21 (nondescript dad).;    At 26, guitarist Ian Dench is the band's musical
brains (daddy's a classical guitarist-turned-postman). Dench had quit his
previous band, Apple Mosaic, and was looking for something meatier when he ran
into this bunch a little younger than himself.;    Bad kids on the block;  "We
met halfway with our thrash and his melody," says Derry. "We clicked in our
first rehearsal." The origin of their punchy sound is a Casio SK-1
bottom-of-the-line sampler purchased from a local electrical shop, plus Ian's
mum's upright piano with a microphone crammed down the back. EMF's teeny-bop
appeal has catapulted them straight into the British tabloids, who've typecast
the group as naughty alter egos to those nice New Kids.;    The guys in EMF
are all too aware that such a reputation may leave them abandoned when the
teens have moved on, with a gap that an older rock audience may snobbishly
refuse to fill. "It's a thin line to tread between accessibility and
credibility," says Ian Dench. "If you look at our cross-section audience, I
think we've done pretty well.";    "We can all play," Derry declares. As if to
advertise their musicality, their album's title drops the name of the
19th-century Romantic composer of whom Dench is a buff. (It also puns on the
old-fashioned powdery-white British candy, sherbert dip, thus alluding to
"showbiz sherbert," as cocaine is often called by English rockers.);    And
proclaiming its rebel-rock credentials, the band occasionally torches and
trashes its gear at encore time. Hence the Pistols tag, which Tennant bestowed
after he saw EMF win over a beerglass-chucking audience in London.;    "Neil
turns up at the weirdest gigs," says Derry. "In he walks in his three-grand
overcoat, gliding along like Darth Vader. The crowd wasn't malicious -- they
were dancing away. I'd rather have them throwing glasses than teddy-bears and
knickers with 'I love Derry' on them.";    Personalized knickers -- a welcome
compliment, surely?;    "Not," Derry draws his hands a few inches apart, "when
they're only this big.";     EMF; plus Pop Will Eat Itself; Where: The
Warfield Theater, 982 Market St., San Francisco; When: Saturday (doors open 8
p.m., show at 9); How much: $18.50 general admission (415) 775-7722.; Etc:

   A new attitude toward the Soviet Union has
already prompted retooling at America's national laboratories, the
three top-secret centers of nuclear weaponry and ``Star Wars''
research and development. As scientists search for new ways to use
their know-how, researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are
finding ways to help clean up the environment.

   The silver trough, as long as a
football field, was developed to harness the sun and help wean the
nation off imported oil. For years, it stood abandoned in the
desert, an obsolete relic of the 1970s.
   Now, in another time and another growing national crisis,
researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have dusted off their
sophisticated solar panels and put them back to work.
   This time, the panels are helping the environment. Sandia
scientists believe they've found an efficient way to use solar
power to break down toxic waste, help clean up polluted dumps and
cleanse contaminated water tables.
   ``We're just helping nature, that's all. There's nothing
artificial about this,'' said Virgil Dugan, Sandia's director of
Advanced Energy Technology.
   Solar research is just one area where scientists at Sandia, one
of the nation's three nuclear weapons laboratories, are finding
ways to help with growing environmental problems.
   As the need for ever improved nuclear weapons lessens, the
laboratories are directing their technological might to greater
peacetime use.
   With expertise developed for weapons programs and Army
machinery, ``smart'' robots are hurriedly being assembled to clean
out highly radioactive and toxic chemical waste at Department of
Energy weapons plants across the country.
   ``It's the same technology (that goes into weapons programs),
even though it seems there are two different applications,'' said
Pat Eicker, manager of Robotic Science and Technology at Sandia.
   In the case of the abandoned solar collector, scientists
realized they might be able to run contaminated water, such as
polluted ground water, through the sunlight-focusing machine and
use its power to help break down organic toxic waste.
   The contaminated water is mixed with a catalyst _ titanium
dioxide _ and pumped through a clear tube in the center of the
long, parabolic solar trough.
   The tube glows like Darth Vader's sword as sunlight activates
the titanium dioxide, which frees an electron. The electron grabs
onto organic material, in this case, the contaminates, and breaks
them down into water, carbon dioxide and a mild, harmless acid.
   Until a full-scale experiment last June, scientists weren't sure
if the solar machine would cause complete destruction of the
pollutants. It did.
   ``You can drink the water that comes out at the end,'' said Mike
Prairie, a senior technical staff member on the solar project.
   ``We never did this before because nobody thought of it
before,'' Dugan said. ``Some might say it's a breakthrough. I think
of it as an engineering advancement.''
   Companies are lining up to learn more about Sandia's gadget,
Dugan said. The laboratory plans to have a trial system out in a
year, and Dugan thinks the system is about four years away from
commercial use.
   Sandia has been testing the system with water contaminated by
trichloroethylene, a common degreasing substance that contaminates
ground water. Scientists believe the system will also work on PCBs,
dioxins, pesticides, dyes, solvents and other organic, or
carbon-based, materials.
   The solar panels won't help with the problem of nuclear waste,
however, because that is inorganic.
   Companies must now package their toxic waste and ship it to dump
sites or incinerators. The solar system might be economical enough
to allow even small firms to have on-site waste systems and also
may be portable, Dugan said. It will likely be more efficient, and
cheaper, than current ground water purification systems, he said.
   Sandia's robotics researchers began eight years ago to find ways
to use machines for the sometimes dangerous work of building
nuclear weapons and handling plutonium and other hazardous parts.
   Already the lab has created a ``smart'' manufacturing system
that will help automate some production in weapons plants. It has
also designed wheeled robotic vehicles for the Army.
   Now work is under way to create a system that can clean up toxic
areas too dangerous for humans to venture into at Department of
Energy weapons plants, such as Hanford, Wash.; Savannah River, Ga.;
Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Fernald, Ohio, and Pantex, Texas.
   Scientists say a robotic backhoe will be used at highly
radioactive and toxic pits, along with a 40-foot robotic arm with
sight and radar capabilities that can scan a dump, map pipes and
other obstacles, vacuum sand and dirt, lift and remove drums, and
clean leaking underground storage tanks.
   ``You've got to have some way to get in there and recover this
stuff,'' Eicker said. ``And it's so dangerous, people can't do it.''
   In one shed at Sandia, researchers hastily built a
one-tenth-scale model of a waste dump, along with a robotic arm,
because of a DOE rush to begin the cleanups.
   ``The use of models to simulate situations and the use of
sensors to facilitate work on nuclear weapons production is what
motivated this research,'' Eicker said.
   ``But this has far-reaching applications.''

Advanced Genetic Sciences
Starts Long-Delayed Test
Of Its Frostban Bacteria

   Neither lawsuits, nor TV cameras, nor vandals in the dead of night were able, in the end, to stop the long-postponed rendezvous between a microbe and a strawberry leaf.

   Advanced Genetic Sciences Inc. dispatched a heavily suited sprayer at dawn Friday to test its Frostban bacteria -- known scientifically as pseudomonas syringae -- on less than an acre of strawberry plants about 30 miles east of San Francisco.

   The bacteria have been altered by the deletion of a gene for a frost-promoting protein.
Without that protein, damaging ice crystals don't form on the stems and leaves of plants, explained company scientist Trevor Suslow.

   After four years of litigation, and opposition by residents of the tiny town of Brentwood, Calif., the field test was cleared by Superior Court Judge Darrel W. Lewis.
Judge Lewis on Thursday denied a last-ditch effort by the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, a regulatory-body watchdog organization, and local environmental groups to enjoin the spraying.

   At about 3 a.m. PDT Friday, unidentified foes of the experiment evaded guards, cut through a fence, and entered the strawberry plot, tearing out about 80% of the plants, according to a company officer.

   "Somebody tried to take matters into their own hands.
Our people arrived at about 4 a.m., saw that the plants were still alive and replanted them.
The test commenced at 6," said Kaley Parkinson, chief financial officer.

   As the sun rose, there unfolded an opportunity to photograph the unseen: a ring of TV cameras surrounding the strawberry patch, a phalanx of Environmental Protection Agency officers, corporate officials and guards, all focused on the now slightly bruised strawberry plants, wearing their invisible coat of Frostban.

   It doesn't freeze in April in Brentwood.
However, this isn't viewed as an impediment to the test, Mr. Parkinson said.
In a couple of weeks, the plants will be uprooted again and carted to a laboratory for a simulated freeze to test the bug's protective power.

   The test wasn't the first release of a genetically engineered organism in the U.S., but it was the first such sanctioned test.
Advanced Genetic Sciences, as previously reported, was fined several years ago for spraying the microbes on some trees on the roof of the company's Oakland, Calif., headquarters without authorization.
It called Friday's authorized test "a great day not only for biotechnology but for California's reputation as a leader in regulatory review."

   Opponents, exhausted by their long legal battle, promised that more such fights lie ahead.

   "They did it," sighed a weary Jeremy Rifkin, founder of the Foundation on Economic Trends, after the spraying took place.
"Four years ago, when we brought suit, the sum total of public discussion of biotechnology was a 19-minute hearing at the National Institutes of Health's RAC (recombinant DNA advisory) Committee," he said.
"Now, there's a world-wide discussion about the biotechnology revolution.
And I think we're all better off for it -- even the companies who yelled and screamed."

   Mr. Rifkin scoffed at the company's repeated assurances of Frostban's safety, saying the bug "could be pathogenic."
He added, "That's why the sprayers had to wear those Darth Vader suits."

   Moreover, he put companies on notice that he will continue to stir up public debate on such experiments.
His next battleground will be in Peppin County, Wis., where, he said, BioTechnica International Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., plans to test a nitrogen-fixing microbe on alfalfa plants.

   "If the first experiment took four years to address, think of what the next experiments will take," he said.
"It's gonna be a long battle."

   Separately, the University of California at Berkeley said Friday that its scientists will initiate a similar experiment in a potato patch in Tulelake, Calif., near the Oregon border, on Wednesday.

as bold as the crusaders' pennants or the flags of imperial Rome.;    But what
most distinguished Washington's National Victory Celebration wasn't its

<HEADLINE>  THOUSANDS SALUTE GULF WAR TROOPS
CROWDS CHEER THE GEAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It was what happened a thousand feet overhead a few minutes into the event,
when a single, angular, dead-black F-117A Stealth fighter slashed across the
sky in demonstration of what really distinguished the harsh, fast, one-sided
war against Iraq from all that had gone before it.;    Below, as the plane
passed, 200,000 necks craned and 200,000 voices turned from cheer to animal
roar.;    They might have come to honor the soldiers, but they truly loved the
gear.;    Cheers for troops, machines;    They cheered the M-1A1 tanks, the
trucked-in Patriot and Tomahawk cruise missiles and the towed fighter planes
almost as much as they did the first military unit sent to the gulf, the famed
82nd Airborne Division.;    Few among them seemed much bothered that these
same weapons had delivered massive death and destruction only a few months
before.;    "Wow!" said 7-year-old Lauren Broussard of Vienna, Va., when the
Stealth tore by. "It looks just like Darth Vader's ship.";    Stephanie
Diesel, 30, of Annandale, Va., the daughter of a retired naval officer, said
it with somewhat more sophistication: "We've had family involved in helping
develop some of the weaponry. It's nice to see it paid off.";    It was that
kind of crowd, one that included President Bush and a mass of government VIPs
and countless other federal employees as well -- a Washington-area crowd
tightly connected to the military and the bureaucracy, closer than most of the
country to weapons and the workaday of war.;    "Great day," exulted Bush, the
parade's reviewer-in-chief.;    The 200,000 people estimated by National Park
Police to have lined Constitution Avenue for the parade were far fewer than
predictions of 600,000 or more, and that's the sort of thing Washington
probably will argue about for a while: Does it mean disenchantment with the
war? Was the $12 million spent on the parade a bad idea? Was the parade itself
a bad idea?;    Amid the cheers and the promise of future debates, there were
tears.;    'Quiet remembrance';    "War also deserves quiet remembrance," Bush
said as he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National
Cemetery in the day's opening event.;    His voice caught as he said Kuwait is
free because "we dared risk our most precious asset, our sons and daughters,
our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives -- the finest troops any
country has ever had.";    Families of some of the 376 U.S. troops who lost
their lives in the Persian Gulf were at Arlington for the ceremony. Eyes
moistened and tears flowed during the singing of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic.";    But among the crowds lining the parade route, there was
near-unanimity that the parade was great, the troops were great, a huge
display of military hardware arrayed amid the Smithsonian museums on the
Washington Mall was great -- and the 82 aircraft that flew over were
tremendous.;    For them, the day was something like a county fair. One
exhibit tent on the Mall contained samples of every important bomb and
airborne missile used in the war; another offered the opportunity to put on a
gas mask; at every weapon exhibit, soldiers explained such questions as
explosive power and lethal range, demonstrated in one case with a howitzer
homed in on the top of the Washington Monument.;    But this was, finally, a
parade for the soldiers, and among those who marched, the day was
overwhelming.;    "I consider this the highlight of my career so far," said
Air Force Special Operations Lt. Rick Masters, an electronic warfare officer
on a giant AC-130 gunship based in Fort Walton Beach, Fla.;    "I lost some
good friends over there, and it all came together when we rounded the first
corner and the crowd started cheering," he said.;    The soldiers and most who
came to recognize them stood worlds away from those who criticized the parade
for its extravagance and its celebration of crushing power.;    However
quickly and efficiently the war was fought, the soldiers said again and again,
it was a war, and as Army Sgt. Donald Gibson of Winchester, Ky., declared with
conviction, "I sure didn't think it was so easy."  </TEXT>

ON CALIFORNIA: FORGET SIGNS -- WHAT'S YOUR AREA CODE?

There is a building in Pasadena where they make new area codes for Southern
California. If you call directory assistance, the operator will not admit this
building exists. Its number is unlisted. But somewhere in the dungeons of this
Pac Bell office, right now, a new area code is being planned for L.A.
</P>
<P>
Not all of L.A., of course. Just certain parts. Once again, the city has
outgrown 213 and some neighborhoods must be marked for exile to a new number, a
new identity. Eventually, in the next three or four years, a visitation will
take place in the dark of night. Whole blocks, small cities, will be taken
away, never to see 213 again.
</P>
<P>
This is not happy news, I know, and thus far the phone company has kept it
secret. Those of you who survived the 818 split in 1984 probably thought you
were safe. Well, you are not. This thing could hit anyplace, snatch anyone's
213. It won't be pretty.
</P>
<P>
If you don't understand the repercussions, think of it this way: there are only
three area codes that mean anything in this country. They are 212 in Manhattan,
202 in Washington, D.C., and our own 213. Everyday, from dawn to midnight, 212
gets on the horn to 213 and vice versa. In turn, both 212 and 213 light up the
fiber-optics to 202. These three form the supreme troika of codes; they run the
country, and you're either in this troika or you're out. Soon, a big chunk of
L.A. is going to be out.
</P>
<P>
And who's to blame for this new split? Not Pac Bell, as tempting as that might
be. No, it's us. It's the auto phoners, the faxers, the modem users, the
multiliners. We are eating up phone numbers so fast that even the 818 break-off
did not suffice. So we must make a sacrifice to our phone greed, a sacrifice of
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
And the issue, of course, is which neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Take a look at a map of 213 and you will see how hard the choice will be.
Compared to this, the 818 thing was easy. With 818, Pac Bell simply ran the
boundary down the ridgeline of the Hollywood Hills. Everyone to the north was
out. There was such a logic to it that the whining of the 818'ers was
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
This time, there's no geography to use. That means the company has to make its
decision on cultural grounds. Should the Westside be lopped off? Just picture
the wailing. Or should downtown become the cultural amputee, cut off from its
telephonic roots?
</P>
<P>
In truth, Pac Bell could go after the smaller players, like East L.A. or
South-Central. There's one major problem with this strategy: it would leave the
company vulnerable to the charge that Latinos and blacks had been gerrymandered
out of the code, leaving 213 to the rich whites. As I say, this could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
And there's the matter of the new number itself. This country has been gobbling
area codes so fast that only a few remain available. The phone company won't
reveal these numbers, but that's OK. We've made our own calculations, based on
the arcane rules of area code formation. The list of possibilities looks pretty
much like this: 310, 410, 903, 909, 910.
</P>
<P>
In my mind, there's only one choice. The numbers ending in 10 are entirely too
friendly for L.A. They're codes for the suburbs. And 903 is nowhere, a nebbish.
That leaves 909, a great code. Nine-Oh-Nine has dark power, it's a sort of
Darth Vader number. Nine-Oh-Nine could carry on the struggle with New York.
</P>
<P>
All of which leads me to my modest proposal. As we know, show biz has always
existed as a separate community in L.A., a world that's hidden and unavailable
to the minions. Swell. Let's recognize that, draw a circle around the show biz
neighborhoods and give them this new power code, 909. Then the rest of the
city, with the old 213, could disengage and go its own way.
</P>
<P>
Think of it. Outside the perimeter of 909, real people would matter once again.
Historians, plumbers and algebra teachers could get reservations at
restaurants. When someone slapped a cop, they'd just go to court and take their
medicine with no fuss. Newspapers, spared the celebrity fever, would have more
space to print stories about lost dogs.
</P>
<P>
As for the new 909'ers, they would hate it at first but soon adjust. Here would
be a universe all their own, uncluttered by the rest of us. Only the trade
papers would be circulated, no need to read other news. Only white limos would
purr down the streets.
</P>
<P>
So consider carefully, Pac Bell. This plan has possibilities and, after all,
someone has to get the ax. Brood on it.

   After the Catholic Church, which institution in the United States has the largest membership?
It's the American Association of Retired Persons, with 30 million members over age 50.
One out of five voters is a member.

   That's why AARP is one of the most feared lobbies in Washington.
Phil Longman, a former congressional aide who was fired from his job only days after criticizing AARP on television, told the New York Times, "When AARP's lobbyist shows up, it's like Darth Vader at the door -- he tells people how to vote."

   AARP's membership is as politically diverse as the nation, but it consistently endorses tax increases and loopy federal programs that many of its members would never think of supporting.
Example number one is the now-infamous catastrophic-healthcare surtax.

   In 1987, its lobbying clout allowed AARP to push through the catastrophic program which imposed a surtax of up to $800 a person largely to pay for coverage more than 85% of seniors already had.
AARP claims its surveys showed senior support for the catastrophic bill, but syndicated columnist Leonard J. Hansen says AARP chapters report they were barely consulted.
The surtax soon generated such an outcry among those who would pay it that the House will begin debate tomorrow on its complete repeal.

   But the Democratic leadership and AARP staffers are trying desperately to salvage something from the program.
Their last-ditch alternative would basically leave intact only the drug benefit, which would pay for half the cost of Medicare-approved drugs after an $800 deductible.
AARP lobbied hard to add that to the original bill and says drug reimbursement "is clearly the most important benefit" of the program, even though two nationwide polls have shown it fell low in the priorities of most seniors.

   Why does AARP persist in lobbying so hard for the prescription-drug benefit?
Perhaps because it is at least as interested in commercial ventures as it is in "representing" its membership.
Founded in 1958 as a group that would "promote independence, dignity and purpose" among the elderly, AARP has become a moneymaking machine that peddles everything from vacations to mutual funds and auto clubs.
A nonprofit entity, in 1987 it employed a legislative staff of 120 and produced a surplus of $32 million without paying taxes.

   One of its more lucrative ventures is as a middleman for the nation's second-largest mail-order drug-supply service.
AARP collects a handsome royalty from every one of the 7.5 million prescriptions it fills, and it stands to gain even more from government reimbursement for drugs.

   Under current law, the government will pay a $4.50 fee for every prescription filled by a pharmacy or mail-order supplier.
Joseph Califano, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under Jimmy Carter, points out that a typical mail-order supplier charges corporate clients only 50 cents to fill a prescription and says the $4.50 dispensing fee "represents a substantial windfall" for AARP.
The law allows a lower reimbursement for mail-order suppliers, but doesn't require it.

   Die-hard support for the drug benefit isn't the only AARP policy stand that flies in the face of reason.
Last week, it weighed into the debate over capital gains with a letter opposing the rate cut and supporting the Democratic leadership's alternative proposal that would expand Individual Retirement Accounts and allow them to be used for college and home-buying expenses.
Now, the leadership is working to save AARP's prescription-drug benefit.

   Of course, the IRA proposal would be of little use to people who are already retired.
However, the Treasury Department reports that 65% of all taxpayers over age 65 realized a capital gain once in the past five years.
AARP says that many of its members under 65 use IRAs, but just as many no doubt realize some capital gains.

   AARP's opposition to a capital-gains tax cut comes as no surprise to Jack Carlson, an economist who was hired in 1987 as AARP's executive director.
Mr. Carlson began exploring some market-oriented solutions for the problems of the elderly, but ran into a buzz saw of opposition.
He was fired after only four months.
He says many of AARP's relatively young staffers have worked in the federal government and "tend to think of a federal solution to any problem.
But I think many members would prefer to see a private or a state solution."

   AARP has clearly strayed from the goals of its founder, retired schoolteacher Ethel Percy Andrus.
In 1965, she wrote, "AARP holds no meetings to bewail the hardships of old age, nor to formulate pressure programs nor stress potential political strength of older folk, nor to urge governmental subsidy."

   AARP is now the embodiment of governmental subsidy.

<HEAD>Publicity War in Greyhound Strike Marks Trend in Labor Disputes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hours after a sniper opened fire on a
Greyhound bus in Florida last month, company chairman Fred Currey
was on the scene, boarding a bus to ride under the very overpass
where the gunman had hidden.
   Currey's visit was part of what a company spokesman termed a
``Florida blitz'' designed to gain Greyhound favorable statewide
news coverage in the early days of the strike by its drivers' union.
   ``Every news person in northern Florida was there,'' said
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley, whose company dispatched Currey
to three Florida cities that day to meet publicly with riders and
replacement drivers.
   Greyhound's public relations gambit was just one battle in the
war to court public favor in the six-week-old drivers' strike, but
analysts say it reflects a growing trend toward sophisticated
publicity contests in labor-management disputes.
   ``A public relation agent is a participant now either at the
bargaining table or right outside the room,'' said Don Blohowiak, a
New York media analyst who studies business-media relations.
   ``The court of public opinion is very important to success in
the marketplace. In something like a labor dispute, our impressions
stay with us for a very long time,'' Blohowiak said.
   He said most consumers ``want to do business with companies we
like or feel good about, companies we think conduct business with
their employees in a reasonable and ethical way.''
   Greyhound is not alone in seeking public favor in the strike.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, without an
in-house public relations department, hired a Washington company
six days before the strike to dramatize the economic issues, such
as the decline in drivers' average pay from $31,000 to $21,000
since 1983.
   Still, some labor leaders complain privately that the union
hasn't been as aggressive as Greyhound in seeking to mold public
opinion.
   ``The union hasn't awakened to the fact that it needs to sell
its message to win,'' said one labor analyst, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   But the union's public relations agent, Nick Nichols, said
striking drivers can't compete with the company's money.
   ``Clearly, it's a David and Goliath thing. The Greyhound drivers
simply don't have the resources,'' Nichols said.
   Neither side in the bus strike will say what it's spending for
public relations advice. Since March 2, when 6,300 drivers and
3,000 maintenance and other workers walked out, the strike has been
marred by vandalism and violence. The company has refused to return
to the bargaining table until a week goes by without a violent
incident.
   Analysts point to the ongoing Eastern Air Lines walkout and last
year's Pittston coal strike as recent labor disputes where unions
waged successful campaigns to win public support.
   Although machinists at Eastern are still on strike, their
publicity campaign against Frank Lorenzo, head of the carrier's
parent company, ``made him out to be the Darth Vader'' of the
corporate world in the public's mind, one labor official said.
   Blohowiak said companies are more media-conscious now than they
were 10 years ago because increased competition has prompted
consumers to consider a company's attitude toward its workers when
making purchasing decisions.
   ``After seeing the drubbing that Exxon took over one accident,
or a Frank Lorenzo took, you can't hide and pretend you don't have
problems, that no one's interested,'' he said.
   Greyhound's efforts to win public opinion have been persistent.
   Twice in two weeks, Dallas-based Greyhound executives flew to
Washington for news conferences to complain about strike-related
violence. Neither event had a Washington focus, and in fact, the
latest one was to announce the filing of a lawsuit in Florida
against union officials.
   Gravley, the Greyhound spokesman, said the event was held in
Washington because that's where the national press corps is based.
   ``If you want to be heard nationally, you have to go where the
national media is,'' said media analyst Don Kellermann.
   Greyhound used a well-known New York public relations firm,
Ruder Finn, for advice and help in setting up the Washington news
conferences. It also has taken out several full-page newspaper ads
on the strike.
   Labor officials contend the company's Washington announcements
are part of a strategy to distort public perception of the strike.
   ``It's a great tack for diverting attention from what the real
issues are,'' said Denise Mitchell, a Washington public relations
agent who helped Pittston miners win widespread community support
during last year's coal strike.
   Sophisticated publicity efforts by management have forced unions
to try to keep up, she said.
   ``We increasingly counsel people that they have to get out front
in the contest to win public support,'' Mitchell said. ``Being
prepared at the bargaining table, doing your homework on the
economic issues, just isn't enough anymore.''
