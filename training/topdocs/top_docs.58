<TEXT>
   Michael and Jane Wellman recently remodeled the kitchen in their home in this suburb north of Detroit. 
They each have their own stove and sink. 
The kitchen also sports a $2,800 Subzero brand refrigerator, a dish-warming drawer and a butler's pantry. 
"It's a dream kitchen," says Mr. Wellman, an avid cook. 

   The kitchen's significance extends well beyond its 12-by-16-foot dimensions. 
Mr. Wellman is vice president for corporate planning at K mart Corp., and his plunge into the kitchen helped convince him that K mart should launch a major offensive in housewares, including everything from kitchen gadgets to decorative bath towels. 
That's why K mart recently hired Martha Stewart -- Connecticut caterer to the rich and famous, and author of lavish bestselling books on cooking and home entertaining -- as its "life-style spokesperson and consultant." 

   In the coming months, K mart will launch a Martha Stewart media blitz, with television commercials, print advertising, displays in its 2,200 stores and perhaps even a television special on holiday entertaining. 
"By Jan. 1 it will be almost impossible for 76 million households not to be aware of the name Martha Stewart," Mr. Wellman declares. 
"We'll make her the next Betty Crocker, only she's a real, live person." (Betty Crocker is the fictional character created by General Mills Inc.) 

   Big changes are under way at K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer (after Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.) 
Since the chain was launched 25 years ago, it built its sales and reputation on just one thing -- low prices. 
To many consumers that also meant unfashionable merchandise. 
Other retailers already have proved that the two needn't go hand in hand -- notably Crate &amp; Barrel, a 24-store chain offering trendy housewares, and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Lechmere home-goods chain. 
Now K mart wants to follow, on a far larger scale. 

   K mart going upscale? 
Perish the thought. 
"Upscale implies that you want to go after customers who aren't shopping in your stores at the expense of the ones who are," says Mr. Wellman. 
"And that isn't true." 

   Instead, K mart will "move from being a low-price item merchant to being a category merchant," says Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive officer. 
In other words, K mart wants to establish certain categories -- such as kitchen and home goods -- in which consumers already think of it as a good place to buy. 
In those categories it will offer a range of goods, from its traditional bargain-basement fare to items with higher quality and fashion, and higher prices as well. 

   The new thrust first became evident two years ago, when K mart hired former "Charlie's Angels" star Jaclyn Smith to endorse a new line of women's wear designed to shed the "polyester palace" image of K mart apparel. 
In its first year, the Jaclyn Smith line reaped $100 million of sales -- without reducing sales of K mart's other women's clothes. 

   More recently, K mart moved to boost its position in sporting goods, which, along with auto parts, is a category where it already holds a big market share. 
The company signed on to sponsor a major golf tournament (the Greater Greensboro Open in North Carolina), as well as the Winter Olympics in Calgary and the summer games in Seoul. 

   Mr. Antonini, who is 46 and just got the chairman's job last month, is the driving force behind all this. 
But the man he's asking to implement it is Mr. Wellman, who is in charge of his "ad hoc committee" to identify "life-style" trends and figure out how K mart can cash in on them. 
The committee settled on "cocooning," which used to be called hanging around the house. 

   The 47-year-old Mr. Wellman is a 23-year K mart veteran. 
A Detroit native and University of Michigan graduate, his Troy home is just three minutes from K mart's headquarters. 
Besides cooking and home entertaining, he likes to shop. 
He regularly strolls through the J.C. Penney store at the Oakland Mall near his home to check on the competition. 

   Mr. Wellman also shops at K mart. 
He says he's the "first to admit" he doesn't buy everything there, but he does pick up shirts, sweaters, and an occasional necktie. 
"This is a knockoff of the Hermes tie," he said recently while browsing at a Detroit area K mart. 
"It's 100% silk, but it costs $6 instead of $60. 
So if you're unfortunate enough to spill soup on it, you just throw it away." 
When he isn't cooking or shopping Mr. Wellman likes to watch television, which makes him a natural cocooner. 

   "There's a lot of media hype about cocooning," Mr. Wellman says. 
"People have been coming home, playing with the kids and watching TV for years. 
But the people doing it now have the money to go out, if they wanted to. 
Instead, they're spending those dollars on their home." 

   But they aren't spending enough of them at K mart. 
And that's where Martha Stewart comes in. 
K mart figures that with the Stewart cachet on its kitchen and home goods, people who once scorned its stores will take a second look and decide, says Mr. Wellman, "that our merchandise is tasteful and good quality." 

   But there's a potential problem. 
Is the K mart shopper the type to pay attention to "Entertaining," Ms. Stewart's first book, for instructions on throwing the "Neoclassic Dinner for Eight to Ten?" (The menu includes artichokes smothered with tomatoes and herbs, roast leg of lamb with garlic-guava glaze, carrot puree and gooseberry mousse.) 

   K mart already has passed the potentially tricky hurdle of bringing Ms. Stewart on board. 
"We were leery that she'd say she would only represent Bloomingdale's," Mr. Wellman says, "but she immediately understood the ramifications." 
Those are, Ms. Stewart explains, "the opportunity to bring the messages in my books to the masses."

   To get more attention this Christmas, K mart Corp. won't just run commercials touting great values in toys, clothes and appliances. 

   The giant retailer is also spending big to produce two television shows, including a movie with Kenny Rogers and a special about Christmas entertaining with author Martha Stewart. 

   The two projects represent the first fruits of a division that King World Productions Inc. formed a year ago June to develop and produce advertiser-sponsored television shows. 

   King World, which earned its fame and fortune as a syndicator of shows produced by others, such as "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy," is becoming a producer itself. 
Its first production effort was "Inside Edition," a tabloid-style syndicated show now in its second season. 

   King World's newest mission is to become a significant provider of advertiser-bankrolled television specials, an expanding market. 
In addition to the K mart projects, King World is developing a television movie based on the book "Free Fall" about an airplane near-disaster, which Kraft General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., is planning to sponsor as an NBC movie-of-the-week. 

   "More and more advertisers are looking to create a big event, not just buy advertising spots," says Jeffrey Grant, president of the King World advertiser-programming division, who previously worked for production companies, including one devoted to advertiser-sponsored projects. 

   Wall Street analysts see King World's move as contributing to its efforts to become a much broader-based entertainment company. 
But the competition is getting tougher. 
King World will be up against dozens of independent producers in Hollywood and divisions of the big Hollywood studios, as well as the growing number of advertising agencies jumping into the business of developing programs for advertisers. 

   "King World will have a lot of competition, but you're as good as your ideas and nobody has a lock on that," says Douglas Ritter, corporate broadcast manager at AT&amp;T, who has so far turned down the scripts King World has shown him. 

   For advertisers, the price tag for these programs is high. 
Clients must spend, for example, upward of $2.5 million to produce a TV movie, and then another $1 million or so to buy the time period from the network. 

   But, says Mr. Grant, the advertiser gets to control the program surrounding its ads, and as the program's owner, may be able to recoup costs through syndication, with additional revenue generated by cassettes and foreign sales. 
For its role, King World will generally receive "production fees, distribution fees and a piece of the back end {profit}," says Mr. Grant. 

   Michael Wellman, a K mart marketing executive, says the retailer isn't necessarily expecting profit, but hopes the two programs become "classics" that can be shown year after year, and perhaps eventually sold as videocassettes. 

   The Kenny Rogers movie, "Christmas in America: A Love Story," will air as a one-hour prime-time movie on NBC. 
"At Home With Martha Stewart -- Christmas" will air three times on the Lifetime cable channel, which has a heavily female audience. 

   Both specials will be promoted in K mart stores and advertisements, where the season's theme will be "Christmas in America." 
Also, Martha Stewart is a K mart consultant and her special will feature dishes and silverware she helped design for the retailer.

<HL> K mart Is Trying to Put Style on the Aisle --- Will Upscale Image Confuse Core Customers? </HL>

   Executives at K mart Corp. were surprised last year when Martha Stewart, an author of books on lavish cooking and entertaining, showed them she could set an elegant table from items sold at the company's discount stores. 

   "We couldn't believe it was our merchandise," recalls Michael Wellman, the company's vice president of marketing, who is now working with Mrs. Stewart to develop an exclusive line of household goods for K mart. 

   Mr. Wellman is now a believer. 
But K mart, in its drive to inject some style into the land of the "blue-light special," has some convincing to do among outsiders. 

   For 26 years, the big Troy, Mich.-based discounter sold low-priced plastic hangers, light bulbs and other odds and ends, often by flashing a blue light to announce spur-of-the-moment specials. 
Now, 47-year-old Joseph Antonini, who became K mart's youngest chairman and chief executive officer last year, is trying to turn K mart into the kind of store that attracts shoppers in search of more stylish goods. 
By upgrading merchandise, store appearance and advertising, he hopes to broaden the goods K mart sells to its younger, better-educated and wealthier customers. 

   To avoid alienating the company's core low-income clientele in the process, Mr. Antonini is aggressively cutting prices on 2,500 frequently purchased items, such as toothpaste and cleansers. 
At the same time, he is pushing K mart into more new ventures than ever before. 

   That strategy forces K mart into a risky balancing act, and some industry observers are skeptical. 
Robert Buchanan, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., St. Louis, thinks K mart should stick to serving low-income shoppers and avoid what he views as the already overcrowded and shrinking middle market served by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., J.C. Penney Co. and others. 

   "They're going to confuse the public about what and who they are," adds Peter Monash, an Ohio-based consultant who has worked extensively for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Indeed, fast-growing Wal-Mart, the nation's third largest retailer, already is threatening to overtake K mart by outdoing it at the discount game. 

   But if Mr. Antonini's gamble pays off, K mart could win the biggest prize of all: the No. 1 slot in retailing, now held by Chicago-based Sears. 

   Mr. Antonini, who worked his way through college playing saxophone in a dance band, seems intent on appealing to the broadest group of shoppers. 
He defines K mart customers as those earning between $15,000 and $60,000 a year. 

   He also is trying to push the company -- which already owns the Waldenbooks, Builders Square and Pay Less Drug Store chains -- into just about every hot area in mass merchandising. 
He plans chains of specialty stores focusing on sporting goods and office supplies. 
He bought a 51% interest in Makro Inc., an operator of low-priced warehouse "clubs" that he plans to expand. 
And he is pushing ahead with a joint venture with supermarket operator Bruno's Inc. to start opening large-scale food and general merchandise stores called "hypermarkets" later this year. 

   Mr. Antonini declined to be interviewed for this article, saying through a spokeswoman that his schedule was too "hectic . . . until probably the first of the year." 
But he told securities analysts in June in Chicago: "Our vision calls for the constant and never-ceasing exploration of new modes of retailing so that our core business of K mart stores can be constantly renewed and reinvigorated by what we learn from other businesses." 
He said he plans to try devoting more space in two K mart stores to low profit-margin grocery items, on the theory that consumers like one-stop shopping. 

   None of these ideas is original. 
The Target unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. always thought of itself as an "upscale discounter." 
Wal-Mart made its name by keeping prices low every day, not just on sale days; it also beat K mart into the warehouse-club and hypermarket businesses. 
Toys "R" Us Inc. and others have proved that you can specialize in discounting a single category of goods. 
Other discounters, meanwhile, also are moving into groceries to try to stay competitive with warehouse clubs and hypermarkets. 

   But K mart can't afford not to change. 
Retailing has become intensely competitive, bristling with stores selling look-alike merchandise that makes it hard for any of them to stand out. 
Discounters, meanwhile, have been savagely slashing prices in an effort to gain an edge. 

   "Unless you take risks in that business," says Fred Yaffe, who runs an advertising agency serving retailers, "you're going to fall behind." 

   By the early 1980s, that's what had happened to K mart. 
Once the trendsetter in the discount-store industry, the former operator of Kresge variety stores was losing ground to its competitors, partly because many of its stores were too small. 
K mart also hadn't invested in computers that track sales and help retailers keep hot merchandise in stock. 
Mr. Antonini says the company suffered from a "malaise" because it had expanded so much that its "growth opportunities might appear to be limited." 

   Mr. Antonini, who revitalized the company's apparel operations by introducing the Jaclyn Smith line in 1985, is trying to change that, partly by enlarging K mart stores and playing catch-up in computerization. 
But in the critical measure of sales per square foot, K mart still lags behind Wal-Mart and Target, with $183 to Wal-Mart's $213 and Target's $193 in the latest fiscal year. 

   Despite skepticism about Mr. Antonini's plan, K mart insiders remain upbeat. 
Three quarters of the adults in the U.S. shop at K mart at least once every three months, and the company's executives believe that the stores can sell those customers more merchandise. 

   K mart is especially interested in selling more profitable and fashionable items to "new collar" working women. 
These are women who hold service jobs and typically are younger, wealthier, better educated and have more sophisticated tastes than the company's core clientele. 
"That's the customer we felt we were not serving properly before," says Mr. Wellman, the marketing vice president. 

   Aiming at that market, K mart plans early next year to start selling an exclusive line of stylish kitchen, bedroom and bath items bearing Mrs. Stewart's name. 
The company also is wooing more-affluent baby boomers by sponsoring a golf tournament and concocting marketing plans aimed at their children. 

   But changing consumers' perceptions takes time. 

   In focus groups earlier this year, Mandy Putnam, a consumer researcher at Management Horizons, found that shoppers "were a bit confused" by the elegant table settings in K mart ads featuring Mrs. Stewart. 
"It just didn't fit with their previous image of K mart," she said.

<HL> Retailers Broaden Their Ad Campaigns To Promote Image as Well as Products </HL>

   Retailers, facing intense competition at a time when most stores carry look-alike merchandise, are turning increasingly to image advertising to try to make an impression on jaded consumers. 

   K mart Corp. and the Dayton Hudson department store unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. are among the retailers that have recently introduced image campaigns, seeking to convey messages that are broader than just pricing for specific products. 

   "You've got to say more than, 'I've got this on sale now, come and get it,'" says Michael Wellman, vice president of marketing at K mart. 
"Everybody's got pretty much the same thing." 

   The shift toward image advertising could lead retailers to rely less on newspaper advertising and more on television, radio, magazines and possibly even billboards to get their messages across. 
For the first quarter, retailers spent only 1% more than last year on newspaper advertising, but the Newspaper Advertising Bureau is projecting a 6% increase for the year. 
Industry experts attribute the first-quarter softness to weak retail sales and Campeau Corp.'s takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc. 

   K mart, based in Troy, Mich., dropped one of its two weekly newspaper advertising circulars in February in favor of a humorous television campaign that emphasizes the variety and quality of its merchandise, rather than simply sale items. 

   K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer, expects to reduce advertising spending by $50 million in its current fiscal year and $25 million next year as a result of the change. 
In the fiscal year ended Jan. 27, K mart spent $617 million on all types of advertising. 

   The new K mart campaign is part of a broader effort by the discounter to shed its image of a low-price retailer carrying only bargain-basement products. 
K mart has upgraded its merchandise and hired as a spokeswoman Martha Stewart, an author of cookbooks and home-entertainment guides. 
It plans to advertise more on television and radio, in magazines and in the news pages of newspapers, rather than just in inserts. 

   "What we're trying to do with our TV ads is to project an image of what the store is and stands for," while at the same time promoting specific products, K mart's Mr. Wellman says. 
"It's a waste of dollars not to do both." 

   Dayton Hudson, which operates Dayton's and Hudson's department stores in Minnesota, Michigan and elsewhere in the Midwest, is trying a combined approach, too. 
In April, it launched its first image campaign since the early 1980s: a series of TV commercials consisting of slice-of-life vignettes, snappy theme songs and tag lines that declare that Dayton's or Hudson's "Knows You." 

   When the image ads are on the air, says John Pellegrene, senior vice president of marketing at the chain, "the response on the day-to-day advertising is much better. 
The awareness of the stores goes way up." 

   Now Dayton Hudson is using the music and the tag lines in its more traditional product-oriented TV ads. 
It is also using the tag lines on some print and direct mail ads. 

   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., on the other hand, has scaled back its "There's More for Your Life at Sears" campaign, prompting some critics to brand it a failure. 

   A spokesman for Chicago-based Sears says the TV, radio and newspaper ads are still being used while a new slogan, "Sears -- Your Money's Worth and a Whole Lot More," is tested in print advertising in New York and Los Angeles. 
"We do believe in image campaigns," the spokesman says. 

   But how much retailers tilt toward image advertising could depend on whether consumer spending picks up in the critical Christmas shopping season. 
So far this year, most big retailers have been posting sales only slightly ahead of last year's. 
If the pattern continues, retailers could be forced to discount heavily and to spend most of their advertising budgets promoting those sales. 

   "The test of how much we'll be spending in advertising image versus promotional will be measured by the mood and temperament of the customer," says William D. McDonald, senior vice president of marketing and sales promotion for the Broadway division of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.

<HL> McCall's and K mart Create a Magazine For Joint Promotion </HL>

<TEXT>
   McCall's magazine and K mart Corp. are teaming up to attract future readers and buyers by creating a new promotional magazine for six- to 12-year-old girls. 

   The minimagazine, to be called "Betsy McCall" after the McCall's paper doll character of the 1950s, will be given away at K mart discount stores and will be inserted in three issues of McCall's for the next two years, starting with the September issue. 
The big Troy, Mich.-based discounter also signed an exclusive licensing agreement to use the Betsy McCall name on products such as toys, clothing and accessories. 

   Arrangements like this between corporations and publishers are becoming more common now as publications search for new sources of advertising revenue. 
Advertising pages in McCall's, part of Working Woman/McCall's Group, have fallen 15.6% this year, according to Media Industry Newsletter. 
Meanwhile, more retailers, struggling to distinguish themselves at a time when stores are selling look-alike merchandise, are turning to joint marketing programs to develop exclusive products. 

   The new McCall's magazine will attempt to reach young girls through their mothers by capitalizing on baby boomers' nostalgia for the Betsy McCall doll of their youth. 
The minimagazine, which will be prepared by a promotional staff of McCall's, will be supported by advertising from K mart and its suppliers; it won't carry ads for other retailers. 
Five million copies will be inserted in McCall's, and a million more will be given away at K mart. 

   Under this arrangement, K mart will become one of McCall's top five advertisers, which means the retailer will contribute more than $1.5 million a year. 
The minimagazine's pages sell for more than McCall's usual rates; besides K mart, advertisers in the 16-page first issue include Pepsi, Mott's and Scripto. 

   "The magazine is written for and about young girls, an age group K mart hopes to attract as customers with this promotion," said Michael Wellman, K mart's vice president for marketing. 
"We want to appeal to these girls and keep them as lifelong K mart shoppers." 

   K mart also is launching other joint marketing ventures. 
Last year, the nation's second-largest retailer hired Martha Stewart, an author of books on lavish cooking and entertaining, as a celebrity spokeswoman. 
It is now developing an exclusive line of household merchandise that bears her name. 

   Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., meanwhile, is selling a line of McKids clothing under a licensing arrangement with McDonald's Corp. and is developing other children's products under a similar agreement with Walt Disney Co.

issue No. 2 ("Spring") of "Martha Stewart Living" is on the newsstands now,

faced with the happy decision of not whether, but how often.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A PERIODICAL HIT FOR MARTHA STEWART ADDICTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Martha Stewart Living" is apparently intended as a periodical version of
one of her cooking-gardening-decorating-entertaining manuals, whose combined
sales would more than fill a converted carriage house. Issue No. 2 contains
128 pages of advice on how to make your life more -- well, gracious.;    "We
here at the magazine share the same concerns as all of you," says "A Letter
From Martha." "We have our ways of coping, and in this issue we try to share
them.";    Among those ways:;    Easter eggs can be dyed with onion skins.
Yogurt helps turn clay pots mossy. A Bay Area woman "put her husband through
law school by decorating light-switch covers." If antique linen smells of
bleach, it's post-1900. "An afternoon filled with the clankety-clank of
horseshoes or the hefty thwap! of a croquet mallet is an unbeatable
pleasure.";    "We want to show people that making your house a beautiful,
comfortable place for your family is a valid and important thing to do," said
editor Isolde Motley, "and that you can do it without spending a lot of money.
You don't have to have an interior decorator.";    The magazine assumes both a
high level of education and a love of Martha Stewart on the part of its
readers. There are quotations from Jefferson, George Eliot, Moliere and the
Talmud in a text illustrated with 15 photographs of Martha Stewart (including
the cover but not including the tear-out subscription blank). There are an
additional half-dozen photos of what are presumably Stewart's hands.;    There
is an entire feature on how to decorate a small cottage. This one is owned by
Alexis Stewart, Martha's daughter and the associate style editor of "Martha
Stewart Living." It contains a splendid collection of Depression glassware and
dishes.;    To whom is all this of interest?;    "Women very like us," Motley
said. "Women who have jobs, are in their late 30s, making a decent amount of
money, but for whom the home and the family are the most important thing. . .
. I'm in my late 30s and so is almost everyone on my staff.";    Publisher
Eric G. Thorkilsen puts the magazine's "demographics . . . very much at the
high end. We've been surprised.";    About 375,000 people paid $3 to buy the
first issue at the newsstand (indeed, 400 of them besieged the Time-Life
building in New York, money in hand, demanding it) and almost every one of
them was female, Thorkilsen said.;    They had a median age of 39 and a median
household income of $63,000 ("which for magazines is way up there"). Most had
been to college, most were married, most were employed outside the home.;   
In short, a dream audience. Perhaps that's why the first, unheralded issue,
with no advance sales and no subscriptions, contained 26 full-page
advertisements, all in color, all paid for at a rate of approximately $7,800 a
page. The second issue contained 36 full-page ads, all paid for.;    "We
wanted to measure true advertising demand by actually asking advertisers to
pay," Thorkilsen said.;    Half a million copies of each issue were printed,
he said. The sales have been "astounding, especially in this kind of economic
climate. For even a well-established magazine to sell 75 percent on the
newsstand is an excellent result. And for this kind of magazine, that no one
had ever heard of . . . (it's) a stunning result.";    Sales of the second
issue, while as yet unmeasured, appear to be running at the same level. And
enough of those subscription blanks have been returned to indicate continued
interest -- despite the lack of any discount for subscribers. ("Please enter
my charter subscription and bill me later for only $18.");    The tiny print
says: "6 times a year," but that's a guess. "We haven't made the rollout
decision," said Thorkilsen -- i.e., the decision to go ahead with the magazine
-- "but this year, there would be four issues -- Spring and three more." By
next year, he said, "Martha Stewart Living" could be a bimonthly. Ultimately?
"Monthly or 10 a year . . . depending on how things go.";    In "Martha
Stewart Living," photographers are credited but writers (except for Stewart
herself) are not.;    "Everything is written in-house, and . . . each article
tends to be a team effort," Motley said. "Somebody will write a sidebar,
somebody else will write captions, somebody else will write introductions. I
hired people who wrote the way I wanted them to.";    She sought to reproduce
a consistent voice, she said, and that voice is -- "There's no deception here"
-- Martha Stewart's.;    It's "a very inclusive, warm, personal voice.";   
Stewart herself is listed on the masthead as editor in chief, keeps an office
at Time-Life and has "a lot -- a lot" to say about the magazine, Motley said.;
   Stewart has the last word in more ways than one. A column called
"Remembering" closes the Spring issue. It's a cautionary tale about a puppy
named Shiner, who, chosen merely because he was cute, treated the Stewart
furniture and floors ungraciously. "Just as we are responsible in the way we
care for our pets, we must be responsible in the way we acquire them," she
counsels.;    The article is illustrated with photographs of Uncle Vanya, Max,
Zuzu, Teeny and Weeny Stewart, beautiful creatures all, and includes the name
of Martha Stewart's veterinarian.  </TEXT>

   Patsy Pace is a homemaker without a lot of time for fancy
cooking. Besides, her husband often works late, and her two
small children prefer a can of SpaghettiOs to galette of root
vegetables. Her house -- in Hinsdale, Ill. -- needs cleaning
and fixing up, and she rarely entertains.
   But Patsy Pace can dream. So she likes to turn to Martha
Stewart Living. "It's the adult version of a children's
picture book," Mrs. Pace says. "It's escapism."

<TEXT>
   In fact, it's a new magazine about homemaking.
Collaborating with Time Publishing Ventures Inc., Martha
Stewart -- author, entrepreneur and homemaker extraordinaire
-- has just published the second test issue of an upscale and
updated version of the traditional women's magazine,
featuring articles about food, decorating, crafts, family and
entertaining.
   Although it purports to be a practical guide to a stylish
home, Martha Stewart Living portrays a fantasy world where
women have time to play croquet, kids are clean, and checks
don't bounce. "You read the magazine and dream that someday
you'll be able to have a white room that won't get trashed by
your kids," says Mrs. Pace.
   Says Martha Stewart: "In my mother's day, homemaking
wasn't looked down on. I want to make homemaking glamorous
again."
   At the very least, Martha Stewart is bucking a trend: A
million more American women leave their full-time homemaking
jobs for the work force every year. And that has been
particularly bad news for the women's service magazines,
which specialize in the subject of homemaking. The combined
circulation of the so-called Seven Sisters -- Ladies' Home
Journal, Redbook, McCall's, Woman's Day, Better Homes and
Gardens, Good Housekeeping and Family Circle -- declined by
eight million in the last decade.
   The first issue of Martha Stewart Living came out last
fall, and about 400,000 copies sold -- better than expected.
Based on readers' responses, the audience is wealthier
(median household income more than $60,000) and younger
(median age 39 years old) than that of the women's service
magazines ($30,000 and early 40s). Martha Stewart Living
sells for $3 -- compared with the $1 to $2 prices of the
Seven Sisters.
   There are additional differences. Ms. Stewart's idea of a
quickie meal is roast peppered rack of lamb and vanilla ice
cream with hot rhubarb-blackberry compote -- not sloppy joes.
Martha Stewart throws Easter-egg hunts in a topiary garden.
Women's magazines warn of "hidden poison in your backyard."
Martha Stewart shows readers how to create regulation
badminton courts. Women's magazines show women scrubbing dogs
in old washtubs.
   Martha Stewart's advertisers are Mario Buatta and Absolut
vodka, in contrast to the Tide and Slim-Fast ads found in the
Seven Sisters. What's more, Martha Stewart Living is
expensively photographed, printed on high-quality stock and
resembles upscale "shelter" magazines like HG or Metropolitan
Home or food magazines like Food &amp; Wine. (New York radio
personality Don Imus describes Martha Stewart Living as "the
whitest magazine I've ever seen -- all these white people
running around in white clothes.")
   But what really set Martha Stewart Living apart from the
sorority is the presence in its pages of Ms. Stewart herself.
Some would call it omnipresence: She stars on the covers as
well as in many of the how-to projects. "I must maintain a
presence," says Ms. Stewart. "My reader really likes seeing
me wearing a work shirt and digging in the dirt."
   Still, whether there is room for another magazine about
homemaking -- however different -- in the already
overpopulated field is far from clear. Martin S. Walker,
president of Periodical Studies Service, says women's service
magazines are doomed by changing demographics and the
increasing use of print media to target ever more specific
audiences. "The hot magazines in the food category --
Gourmet, Cooking Light -- are targeting very specific
audiences within women," he says.
   Balancing that, James Guthrie, executive vice president of
the Magazine Publishers Association, says the entire
home-improvement and homemaking field has taken a turn for
the better in recent months. "It's sensible, practical,
back-to-basics home and hearth information consumers want,"
he says.
   How that would help Martha Stewart Living, though, is open
to question. Ms. Stewart herself acknowledges that many of
the projects included in the first two issues, such as
printing your own gift wrap or sewing an organdy Easter
dress, go beyond the basics and are impractical for most
modern women, who simply don't have the time. But she's
hoping to change that. "I really want people to get out their
sewing machines again," she says. "I know we don't have time,
but just thinking about it is a step in the right direction."
   A few actually do it. "I did the boxes," says Kim Seegan,
an Agoura Hills, Calif., mother and part-time worker,
referring to painting her own Christmas gift boxes. "But I
don't do the time-consuming things. I wouldn't do one of the
pine-cone centerpieces." Ms. Seegan says she likes Martha
Stewart better than the Seven Sister magazines because Ms.
Stewart's projects are "classy, not cutesy."
   Ultimately, what might help Martha Stewart Living -- and
the rest of the women's magazines, plain or fancy -- is a
change in the nation's demographics. More women may be
working outside the home, but the aging baby boomers, having
started their families, are spending more leisure time at
home. And the whole nature of taking care of a home has
changed from the time the baby boomers were growing up. For
example, in today's high schools, the Future Homemakers of
America -- 15% boys -- learn about money management, staying
fit and entrepreneurship.
   "`Housewife' isn't a very popular term anymore," says
Alecia Benjamin, the Future Homemakers' director of public
affairs. "The word is homemaker, which means learning to do
everything, not just cook and sew."
   But what Martha Stewart believes is the most significant
boost to her and the other homemaking magazines is the ending
of an era when it wasn't chic to think about making a home.
"In the past 10 years, women thought jobs were more important
than their homes," she says. "But you can't just put your kid
in a box and wait for him to grow up. Now people are starting
to get out of that attitude."

<LEADPARA>  IF YOU are overcome by the desire to make a Christmas plum pudding for 200 or
find yourself combing K marts for that perfect matching sheet set, don't
bother calling a doctor. There is no cure for Martha Stewart Madness.;   This
cultish obsession with improving hearth and home has swept the country of

arts and crafts entrepreneur who makes a small fortune offering advice on
practically every facet of modern living.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MARTHA STEWART ON CHICKENS, SCRUBBING FLOORS AND K
MART  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In her new magazine (Martha Stewart Living) and in her cooking, decorating
and entertaining books, Stewart shows the masses how to transform a piece of
fish into a tasty treat (with chervil butter) for 12, how to make curtains out
of sheets, how to make an ordinary home better and brighter.;   In an
interview conducted while Stewart planned a housewarming/birthday party for
herself and 299 guests, she talked about her upcoming book and her love for
chickens.;   Q May I ask how old you're going to be?;   A No. (Stewart excuses
herself to take a call.);   Q You must be the only woman to have her own
magazine and appear on each and every cover. Do you think it's vain, to always
be . . .;   A My own cover girl? (Laughs) Nobody has said anything -- yet. But
it fits with the format. We're trying to make a magazine that has a lot of
continuity, and you're right, it does feel strange, and I'd like to turn my
back on the cover a bit. But it's working. People are buying it.;   Q Who is
the type of person who is Martha Stewart-obsessed -- who reads your books and
magazine?;   A Ninety-nine percent of the people are women -- though men look
-- and she's about 39 years old with a family income over $75,000, and she
lives in a house that costs over $158,000. She reads and she does.;   Q Why
are you so popular?;   A Because my readers know that I really do these
things, and they think that if I do them, they can do them.;   Q What's the
best Martha Stewart hairstyle that you've ever modeled on one of your book
covers?;   A I sort of like the "Quick Cook Menus" look, just because it was
simple. (Editor's note: Stewart is modeling a windswept Cape Cod-esque bob.); 
 Q What's your most elaborate project? Is it the Christmas gingerbread mansion
with 14 bathrooms? I tried to make that once, and it ended up looking like
some decrepit condo project.;   A (Laughs) Oh, that's terrible. I would say my
garden, which is the complete focus of the new book, "Martha Stewart's
Gardening Month By Month." It took us four years to photograph, and it has
everything -- berries, vegetables, vines, herbs, bulbs, garden architecture.; 
 Q Some of your ideas seem a little overboard. You actually make your own
Christmas wrapping paper, cure your own hams. What do you say to people who
think you are excessive?;   A I say I really like to do these things. You can
never overreach when it comes to doing things for your home. I mean, an
Olympic skater doesn't say after making a triple jump, "That's enough, I'm not
going to try for a quadruple.";   Q I bet you even have a creative way to mop
the floor.;   A Of course. On your hands and knees is the only way to reach
every tiny crevice. I walked in on my daughter the other day, and there she
was in her garage on her hands and knees with a soapy rag. She learned that
from me; I learned that from my mother, and that's the only way. If a
housekeeper starts using a sponge mop, I simply say, "You cannot do that.";  
Q Which foods are in and which are out?;   A Butter is out. Beautiful green
olive oils are in. Produce-wise, fragrant white peaches are hot.;   Q You
obviously taste the food you make. Why don't you weigh a thousand pounds?;   A
Because I've got a personal trainer. I torture myself at the gym every
morning. (Laughs) I have to look good for the cover, you know!;   Q You have
more groupies than the average rock star. They're very devoted, aren't they?; 
 A Oh yes. Sometimes they have a dinner party using my recipes and set a place
for me. (Laughs) Of course, I never show up. And some want to know the breeds
and names of my cats, so they can copy that. They want to have chow dogs like
I do, that type of thing. It's about emulation and it's flattering.;   Q You
are also a spokesperson for K mart. What's your rebuff to people who say the
stores are tacky?;   A I just say, 'Go see the new 160,000-square-foot store
they opened in Medina, Ohio.' Have you been there? They have a grocery, a meat
market, everything.;   Q But you don't shop there?;   A Oh, I'm a very big K
mart shopper. I just bought $780 worth of stuff from there last week, because
when you're doing a new house, you need everything -- cleaning supplies, light
bulbs, the works.;   Q Spy magazine once wrote that you ran over a sack full
of baby chickens with your car because they didn't fit in with your plans. If
this wasn't true, why didn't you sue?;   A Well, I was doing my magazine deal
at the time, and it wouldn't have done me any good to be litigious. At first I
laughed -- it was so ridiculous -- until K mart got a letter from PETA (People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) talking about a boycott. Those little
jokes or whatever they are -- they are harmful. I told PETA to come and see my
chickens. I keep the cleanest coop in the country.;   Q You find the time to
raise chickens?;   A Sure. (Laughs) And we get the most beautiful eggs.  </TEXT>

   Time Warner Inc., furthering its ties with one of
America's most popular style mavens, is exploring the start
of several new media ventures featuring Martha Stewart.
   The projects under consideration include a television
series, home videos and books. They represent a bid to build
on the early success of Martha Stewart Living, a home
entertaining magazine that has exceeded sales expectations
with two test issues the company has published since the
fall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Time Publishing Ventures Inc., a unit of the publishing
and broadcasting giant, is negotiating a contract with Ms.
Stewart that is expected to last at least six years and
"possibly much longer," Ms. Stewart said.
   She declined to specify terms of the arrangement, which is
expected to be announced formally in coming weeks.
   The agreement will likely solidify plans for Martha
Stewart Living to be published on a quarterly basis this
year, and then bimonthly starting next year, Ms. Stewart
said. Details of other projects aren't firm, she added, but
they all would be tied closely to the contents of the
magazine.
   The projects are likely to offer joint-buying deals for
advertisers who covet Ms. Stewart's upscale following.

<HEAD>Antonini Says New Stores, Ad Appearances Will Help 4th Quarter</HEAD>

   A persistent economy, precision marketing and
even some personal television appearances could help K mart Corp.
out of its 1989 sales doldrums, company Chairman Joseph Antonini
says.
   Antonini also outlined a $1.3-billion expansion plan Tuesday
that would increase the number of K mart discount stores to 2,500
by 1995, from the current 2,283.
   The chairman told a news conference he is trying his new
advertising approach in commercials being tested in the Pueblo and
Colorado Springs areas of Colorado.
   ``I can go on TV in front of the American public and tell them
what we are doing,'' he said, adding that he will appear nationally
in commercials on two K mart-produced Christmas specials.
   One is ``Christmas in America,'' a movie starring Kenny Rogers.
The other is a program on Christmas entertaining with author Martha
Stewart, who also lends her name to a line of K mart household
products.
   Antonini said lower-than-expected inflation and interest rates
and better-than-expected employment are raising his hopes for
strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year.
   ``We're more optimistic than we were four months ago,'' he said.
   The fourth quarter is the last hope for a strong year; K mart
said last week that third-quarter profits will be down from last
year.
   The fourth quarter also could get a boost as K mart opens 43 new
stores and finishes the expansion of 63 others this fall, Antonini
said.
   Beyond that time, profit margins will improve as the company
connects 2,200 of its stores to its centralized inventory computer
system by the end of next year for greater marketing precision,
Antonini said.
   ``We know what product sells in Hoboken, New Jersey, we know the
price it sells for, and we know how many sold on Monday,'' he said.
``We never knew that before.''
   Television advertising will be stepped up, he said. After buying
about 24 weeks of national television advertising for this year,
the company will increase that to about 30 weeks next year and key
some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars.
   K mart predicted sagging third-quarter earnings last week when
it reported September sales of $2.6 billion. That was up 6.1
percent from September 1988, but up only 3 percent when comparing
stores open for the full year.
   The company reported earnings of $145 million, down 10.9
percent, for its second fiscal quarter, which ended July 26.
Second-quarter sales of $7 billion were up 4.8 percent.
   For the fiscal year, beginning Feb. 1, sales reached $17.7
billion through Sept. 27, up only 4.7 percent overall and a
sluggish 1.2 percent on a comparable store basis.
   K mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of $803 million on sales of
$27.3 billion.

   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. suspended publication of
Fortune France, a French-language version of its U.S. edition
published in partnership with Hachette Filipacchi Group.
   Time Inc. Magazines, the publishing unit of Time Warner,
said it backed out of the two-year-old venture after clashing
with its partner about the editorial direction of the
magazine. Time and Hachette shared revenue from the business
magazine, and Marshall Loeb, managing editor of the U.S.
edition of Fortune, had final approval of stories used in the
French edition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The closure of Fortune France is a setback to Time
Warner's plans to extend its major U.S. magazines in Europe
and Asia. Because of the disagreement over editorial policy
for Fortune France, Time executives said they won't go
through with plans to produce a Spanish edition of Fortune
with Hachette. In Italy, Time Warner currently publishes
Fortune Italia in partnership with Arnoldo Mondadori Editore
S.p.A.
   In a related development at home, Time Warner said it will
publish a test issue of a woman's magazine developed with
home entertainment entrepreneur Martha Stewart. The magazine,
called Martha Stewart Living, is being developed by Time
Publishing Ventures, a newly formed unit. The magazine's
first issue will appear in November, with a second issue
planned for early spring 1991.
   Despite a poor advertising market for magazines, Time
Warner has several other titles in the works, including
Fortune for Students, with distribution through Junior
Achievement, a nonprofit organization. There's also a sports
history magazine, with the working title Sports Illustrated
Classic, that will be published three times in 1991.
   With the largest U.S. and French magazine publishers
behind it, Fortune France was an early hit, selling out on
newsstands, and proving to be a model of expansion for Time
Inc. magazines in Europe. Time Warner and Hachette would have
shared profits, but the two-year-old magazine wasn't expected
to make money until after 1991.
   In the last year, advertising for Fortune France dropped
off. On newsstands, the magazine, with circulation of 50,000,
faced competition from a growing number of French and
European business magazines.
   In order to spur a new wave of interest in Fortune France,
according to Time executives, Hachette editors were calling
for more life style coverage in the business magazine.
Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune, objected to
Hachette's plans. Hachette executives could not be reached
for comment.
   James B. Hayes, publisher of U.S. Fortune, said Time
didn't want to compromise Fortune's reputation. "Our
franchise is management issues and issues of importance to
corporate executives," he said.

   Opening 43 new K mart discount stores in the
fourth quarter could boost the end of a lackluster year at the
nation's second-largest retailer, Chairman Joseph Antonini said
Tuesday.
   Antonini also said at a news conference that he will make some
personal appearances in television ads in an effort to lure
customers. ``I can go on TV in front of the American public and
tell them what we are doing,'' he said.
   In addition, Antonini outlined a $1.3 billion expansion plan
that would increase the number of K marts to 2,500 by 1995 from the
current 2,283.
   Lower-than-expected inflation and interest rates and
better-than-expected employment raise the possibility of the kind
of strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year,
Antonini said.
   Because the economy seems to be holding up, he said, ``We're
more optimistic than we were four months ago.''
   K mart will open 43 new stores this fall and complete expansions
of 63 others by the end of October, Antonini said.
   He said he already made television commercials being tested in
the Pueblo and Colorado Springs areas of Colorado, and will appear
in national television ads during two Christmas specials K mart is
producing.
   One is ``Christmas in America,'' a movie that will star Kenny
Rogers. The other a special on Christmas entertaining with author
Martha Stewart, who also lends her name to a line of K mart
household products.
   K mart bought national television advertising during about 24
weeks this year and will increase that to about 30 weeks next year,
keying some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars,
Antonini said.
   He said last week that cutting prices to gain customers has
reduced profit margins and is expected to lower third-quarter
earnings below last year's.
   The company reported earnings of $145 million in its second
fiscal quarter, which ended July 26. That was down 10.9 percent
from a year earlier, though second-quarter sales of $7 billion were
up 4.8 percent.
   September sales of $2.6 billion were up 6.1 percent from
September 1988, but up only 3 percent when comparing stores open

   Publishers Turn Page on Hype, Taking
   Subdued Approach to Magazine Rollouts

   NEW YORK -- Humbled by a spate of new magazine failures in
1990 and a treacherous advertising climate, publishers plan
to play it safe this year.
   The few new magazines that will appear are being rolled
out slowly, with minimal fanfare and investment. Magazines
for urban trendies are out; magazines on home or "quality"
food and cooking have the green light. And publishers are
building readership first at newsstands and supermarket
checkouts before taking the expensive step of finding
subscribers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Publishers' hesitancy is understandable. Some magazines
launched last year emerged half-baked and ill-conceived, and
sank after but a few issues. Others have survived -- but
while barely causing a stir with readers or Madison Avenue.
   The advertising crunch has turned the magazine market into
a battlefield of attrition, claiming the life of 97-year-old
Business Month and six-year-old New England Monthly.
Manhattan inc. and M magazine merged to survive. Promising
newcomers went under, such as 7 Days, Memories and
Southpoint. News Corp. killed Men's Life after one issue,
Fame recently folded and Forbes last week announced it will
scrap EGG, a vestige of the industry's interest in urban
life-style magazines. Spiraling paper and postal costs
contributed to the deaths of these publications, but so did
projections that 1991 will be a period of limited if any
growth in ad revenues.
   The new magazine crop has more followers than
groundbreakers. In a hostile climate, publishers are looking
to tag along where others have blazed a trail.
   Hearst Corp., for example, is exploring the possibility of
a personal finance magazine with Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher
of The Wall Street Journal. It is also proceeding with
American Home, an updated women's
decorating-remodeling-cooking magazine, and Countryside, a
home and family magazine for environmentally conscious
country gentlemen and women.
   In the same spirit, Time Warner Inc. is testing a second
issue of Martha Stewart Living, a home how-to magazine that
has the added cachet of taste arbiter and Kmart Corp.
spokeswoman Martha Stewart. This will be the first full year
for Eating Well, from Canada's Telemedia Inc. Another food
magazine in an already crowded field, this one focuses on the
joy of eating, with a nutritional bent.
   Several magazines that were tested last year in charter or
pilot issues will be published more often and promoted more
heavily, with the aim of capturing a larger, more permanent
audience. Assets, a spinoff from McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Business
Week, is a personal-finance and "executive-living" magazine
that will go from an occasional supplement to a bimonthly.
   At least one new launch, Allure, is a throwback to a more
confident era for magazines. Conde Nast Publications Inc.
Chairman S.I. Newhouse is going ahead with a full-scale
launch in March for the new women's monthly, which will focus
on beauty, fashion, nutrition and fitness.
   The Conde Nast publicity machine is already in full swing.
New York newspaper gossip columnists are reporting on
Allure's progress, a high-concept ad campaign is running in
the trade press, and media kits with sample pages are
circulating to ad agency executives. Last month, Conde Nast
took the expensive route of sending out three million pieces
of direct mail to find subscribers.
   Allure is the first new magazine developed at Conde Nast
since it started Self magazine in 1979. With the company
having lost millions on Woman, a mass-market women's magazine
that Conde Nast folded last July, Allure has taken on greater
importance.
   "The launch of Allure means a lot to this company right
now," says Kathy Neisloss, publisher of Allure. "When is the
right time to launch? Who knows? But at Conde Nast, if you
believe in it, you put all your resources behind it."
   Hearst, in contrast, is taking a more cautious approach
after its experience last year with American Home, whose
first issue fizzled on newsstands.
   Hearst executives surmised that the magazine had too much
of a how-to home decorating look for today's younger
families. Before the second issue, Hearst replaced the editor
with C. Michael Stowers, who gave it a wide-ranging and
timely look. His issue mixed articles on the home with pieces
on architecture, finance, gardening, family issues and the
outdoors. Hearst says Mr. Stowers's issue did much better
than the premiere, selling more than half of the 500,000
newsstand copies.
   But given the crowded market for women's service and home
magazines, Hearst has approved just two issues of American
Home this year. The company hopes to build subscribers
inexpensively through cards stuffed in the magazine. "We
don't launch here, we test magazines," says D. Claeys
Bahrenburg, president of Hearst Magazines. "With big
publicity, if things go wrong, that can greatly diminish your
prestige."
   Hearst is moving far more quickly on Countryside, which
after only two test issues in 1990 will be published
bimonthly this year. "Our research shows we are drawing a
passionate, decidedly upscale reader," says Mr. Bahrenburg.
With its large page size and lush photos, Countryside has
already attracted such advertisers as BMW, Ralph Lauren and
Tiffany.
   Crucial to any new magazine's success is the reaction of
Madison Avenue, which appears more willing now to support
magazines that start slowly and build audiences gradually.
Traditionally, advertising agencies committed clients' ad
dollars to expensively hyped, high-frequency magazines, in
the hope that they could reach large audiences quickly.
   Those days are changing, says Valerie Muller, media
director for Pedone &amp; Partners, a New York ad agency. "Today,
magazines must follow a more natural circulation growth
pattern," Ms. Muller says. "Some of the most successful
magazines spread out the publication schedule, so readers had
time to respond and editors had time to produce a magazine
that addressed readers' interests."
   Media hype has led to some major disappointments, such as
last year's Entertainment Weekly launch by Time Warner. The
magazine had substantial early commitments from major
advertisers, but from the first issue, readers and
advertisers were turned off by its design and organization.
Time Warner hastily changed the magazine's look and content,
and its newsstand sales and ad pages are rising.
   One casualty of the current tough environment may be the
unconventional magazine idea. "The new magazines are more
focused and less glitzy," says Nancy Butkus, who designed
Business Week's Assets. Ms. Butkus says editors are wary
because "it's so tough to make a magazine idea work." She
cites New England Monthly, which won several National
Magazine Awards but couldn't find enough readers or
advertisers to survive. "It's an unforgiving time," says Ms.
Butkus.
   Entrepreneur Robin Wolaner, who sold a 50% interest in her
Parenting magazine to Time Warner before the magazine's first
issue and later sold the other half to Time, says she now
sees about 10 magazine proposals a month as vice president of
development for Time Publishing Ventures Inc. In the past
eight months, Ms. Wolaner has passed on virtually all of
them. "I haven't seen a whole lot of good things out there,"
says Ms. Wolaner.
   Time Warner has pursued at least one project, Martha
Stewart Living, but is rolling it out cautiously with a
skeleton staff. Time Warner published one issue last fall and
only committed to a second after the first showed promising
newsstand sales. The magazine is Time Warner's most promising
stab at a women's service magazine, a category it hadn't
previously entered. The sales results on the 500,000 copies
of the second issue this spring will decide whether Martha
Stewart Living is ever a full-fledged magazine.
   Time Warner is considering other ideas, such as publishing
an extra issue of Parenting this year on family travel. If
advertisers and readers like it, it could be the blueprint
for a new magazine.
   The industry may have lost its confidence for big-time
launches, but Allure's Ms. Neisloss says that despite the
doldrums, each new magazine carries with it reason for hope.
People in the industry "are hungry for some good news," she
says. "People are hungry for a winner."

   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc., amid a new flurry of
magazine introductions, said it will publish a spinoff of
Sports Illustrated, to be called Sports Illustrated Classic
and focus on sports nostalgia.
   The magazine is scheduled to be published three times in
1991, beginning with an issue in March. It will be delivered
to Sports Illustrated subscribers and distributed on
newsstands nationwide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sports Illustrated Classic is the latest example of Time
Warner's attempt to build new magazines based on existing
titles, rather than starting from scratch. But even as Time
Warner is extending the Sports Illustrated name, it's unclear
how successful the company has been with similar attempts
recently. Last year, Time launched Sports Illustrated for
Kids, which has built a circulation of 850,000, but it won't
be profitable until 1992, company executives said. Also in
development are Fortune for Students and Time for Kids.
   Donald J. Barr, publisher of Sports Illustrated, said the
sports nostalgia concept tested well among readers. "It's one
of the areas of highest reader satisfaction," he said.
   In a new twist for a Time Warner magazine, advertising in
each issue of Sports Illustrated Classic will be limited to
40 pages. Advertisers also will be offered category
exclusivity if they purchase four pages in each of the 1991
issues. For example, if a toothpaste maker signs up,
competitors won't be able to buy space.
   The magazine joins other new launches at Time Warner.
Despite a rough start for the magazine Entertainment Weekly,
Time Warner said last week it also would try a new woman's
magazine in November with how-to book author Martha Stewart,
to be called Martha Stewart Living.

<HEAD>Time Warner Suspends Publication of French Version of Fortune</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. has suspended publication of
Fortune France, the French language version of Fortune magazine
that it has published since early 1988 in partnership with Hachette
Filipacchi Group.
   A spokeswoman for Fortune said the move resulted from
differences between the partners over the magazine's editorial
direction.
   ``Hachette was looking for more of a lifestyle magazine, while
Marshall Loeb said it should be more consistent with the business
direction of Fortune,'' said Emma Dockendorff, the spokeswoman for
Fortune.
   Loeb is the managing editor of the U.S. edition of Fortune and
had veto power over stories that appeared in the French edition.
   She said Fortune is pursuing talks with others about new
foreign-language editions, however.
   She said Fortune is in negotiations about the possibility of
publishing a Spanish-language edition of Fortune and a Fortune
Benelux edition that would be in Dutch or Flemish for distribution
in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. She declined to say who
Fortune was talking with.
   ``We are disappointed about the need to close (Fortune France)
but we feel confident about our editorial direction,'' Ms.
Dockendorff said.
   She said Fortune International, an English-language version of
Fortune distributed overseas, recently increased its circulation
guarantee to 115,000 from 105,000.
   Time Warner has published an Italian-language version of
Fortune, Fortune Italia, as a joint venture with Arnaldo Mondadori
Editore since April 1989 and that magazine is doing well, Ms.
Dockendorff said.
   On the domestic front, Time Warner's magazine division confirmed
Wednesday that it will publish two test issues of a woman's
magazine developed with author and home entertainment stylist
Martha Stewart.
   The first issue of the magazine, which is being called Martha
Stewart Living, will be put on newsstands in mid-November and focus
on holiday entertaining and family holiday activities, according to
Time Inc. Magazines spokesman Peter Costiglio.
   The second issue will appear on newsstands in mid-March and
focus on spring activities and Easter holiday entertaining.
   Costiglio said 500,000 copies of each issue would be distributed
and a judgment would be made afterwards on whether to continue
publishing.
   Meantime, Sports Illustrated said it is planning to pubish three
special issues in 1991 of a sports nostalgia magazine, tentatively
called Sports Illustrated Classic. It would be distributed to
Sports Illustrated subscribers and sold on newsstands.

ERMA BOMBECK: CHRISTMAS BY THE BOOK? HARDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, someone gave me Martha Stewart's Christmas book for holiday 
entertaining. That's about as cruel as someone offering to set up a deck chair 
for me on the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about a woman who decorates a tree with homemade gingerbread 
cookies brushed with softly beaten egg whites and then painted with gold leaf. 
One year, I hung six fake birds on a tree outside my window. It rained, and 
they looked like their intestines were unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
As I leafed through the book recently, I must say it was seductive. It made 
everything seem so warm and fuzzy and possible. Maybe -- just maybe -- if I 
started early enough, I could pull off a Martha Stewart Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
I figure I'll start by making my own potpourri by gathering together 
tellicherry peppercorns, orrisroot powder, bayberry bark, senna pods, lemon 
verbena and rose hips. I could do that if I had any idea of what I just said. 
</P>
<P>
What the heck: I'll buy a bag at Hallmark and spend the time making homemade 
delicacies. I just have to figure out how many jars I need for onion chutney 
and how far ahead to make the crackers for the soups. I don't believe I said 
that. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if I really want to knock the socks off guests, I'll forgo 
the homemade wreaths and concentrate on the gingerbread mansion on Page 109. 
Yes! Let's see, all Martha lists for that is a recipe for gingerbread (piece of 
cake), another recipe for icing and an architectural drawing course! Give me a 
break, Martha. 
</P>
<P>
Who among us has not dreamed of making our own wrapping paper? Let's see, for 
that I assemble lots of plain brown paper, metallic paint, brushes, surgical 
gloves and a degree in fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
I leaf to the cooking section to see if perhaps there is something different to 
dazzle my holiday guests besides the traditional turkey and ham. There it is, 
all right: cassoulet. Cassoulet lists 22 ingredients, including such staples as 
six 5-pound ducks, two cups of fresh duck fat, 16 pounds of Great Northern 
beans and six pounds of garlic sausage. It serves 100 (I had only 63 at my 
wedding) and takes three days to process. The oven is your problem. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe I won't have a Martha Stewart Christmas, but at least the pictures 
got me in the mood. I saw the book the other day at a bookstore. When no one 
was looking, I moved it from the "Entertaining" shelf to a table stacked with 
fiction.

   K mart Corp., the nation's second-largest retailer, will announce today that Joseph E. Antonini, president and chief operating officer, will become chairman and chief executive officer. 

   The 46-year-old Mr. Antonini will succeed Bernard M. Fauber, who turns 65 -- the company's mandatory retirement age -- at the end of this year. 

   Mr. Antonini became president last year after presiding over a turnaround in the apparel division of the retailer, and is aggressively pushing K mart -- which had sales of $23.81 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28 -- into marketing. 
He spurred the apparel division to develop K mart's own brand of low-priced, quality clothing -- and to retain Jaclyn Smith, former star of the "Charlie's Angels" television show, to endorse it. 

   More recently, K mart has retained Martha Stewart, author of lavish best-selling books on cooking and home entertaining, to endorse its kitchen and household goods. 
And the company is aggressively moving into sports sponsorship, signing on to sponsor the Greater Greensboro Open golf tournament, and has made financial commitments to the Winter Olympic Games in Calgary, Alberta, and the Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. 

   "We are taking care of the same customers we always had," Mr. Antonini recently said at a news conference, "but we want to attract customers who never thought of us before."

<TEXT>  "The Fisher King" is not just a hit film, it has focused Bridges' thinking.
"Homelessness and the human condition has become pervasive in my everyday
psyche," Bridges told Us magazine, "and is definitely crossing over into my
career. You get used to seeing all these people on the street, that you can't
go swimming in the ocean anymore, you can't eat certain things. It's horrible,
man. But after a while we accept it. It'll happen with water soon, too -- you
know, you won't be able to drink tap water anymore. But it'll happen slowly.
First there'll be certain days when you can't drink it. Then never. And it'll
happen in our lifetime, too, if we don't do anything to change it. . . . The
money that would turn hunger around in this country is nothing compared to
what we've blown killing, destroying, spying, invading, supposedly protecting.
It blows my mind. Our leaders know it, too, but they need to stay on this
deadly track for their own survival."; LEA THOMPSON; (box) How about a sequel:
"Ishtar the Duck"?; Thompson had an amazing couple of years back in the
mid-'80s, when she starred in both "Back to the Future" and "Howard the Duck."
One made zillions of dollars, the other lost them. "It's a pretty big thing,
in the span of a year, to be in the biggest hit and the most celebrated bomb
of the season," Thompson told Movieline. "There's 'Heaven's Gate,' there's
'Ishtar' -- is 'Ishtar' really even as great a bomb as 'Howard the Duck'? It's
not the first unfunny comedy that's ever been made, or the last. But I'm still
here." "Here" includes on screen in the new film "Article 99."; RAY CHARLES;
(box) Dissing the rappers; "I know this is a terrible thing to say, but I
can't see how I can get anything out of rap music," Charles told Interview,
when they asked him to talk about the new music scene. "I really can't. People
say, 'Look at it from a poetic point of view.' Well, the poetry -- for me --
ain't that great. . . . I haven't heard anybody in the modern field that I
would say has blown my head off. Partly that might be my own fault, because I
don't get around to hear maybe as much stuff as I could, and you ain't gonna
discover nobody that's going to blow your head off listening to the radio. The
radio is dead. Most of what you hear on the radio is very, very simple. It
seems like the record companies want everybody to sound the same. And that's
another thing: When I was coming up, you could hear artists sing two notes and
you knew who they were. You don't see that now. Maybe I saw an awful lot in my
life, but what bothers me is that I don't see anything coming through to
replace it."; ERMA BOMBECK; (box) Entertaining an opinion about Martha; In
this corner, the columnist who gets much mileage out of posing as a typical
"housewife" (as they used to say). In the other, Martha Stewart, professional
cook/decorator/entertaining specialist. Stewart was kayoed in the first second
of Round One, when Bombeck observed, for the Miami Herald's Tropic magazine,
that the last thing at night Stewart "probably puts a mint on her own pillow."
But then Bombeck was forced to admit, "I don't even know her. But she's so
perfect, she's such a cheap shot. The first time I was introduced to her work
was when I was watching PBS one day near Thanksgiving. And my jaw dropped -- I
had saliva running down my chin. She was running out to the forest, and had
this turkey in a smoker under a bunch of leaves. Hasn't she ever heard of just
add water? Nothing is too much trouble. I mean, she gilds her own cookies.
She's a cheap shot, but fun to pick on, because there's not a woman in the
world who would go to those ends. But we all secretly want to be like Martha
-- get rid of the kids, get a decent house."  </TEXT>

   Spiegel Inc. is joining forces with actress Candice Bergen to create an unusual Christmas gift catalog. 

   The move is part of a growing trend by retailers to associate themselves with celebrities as a way to polish their images and differentiate themselves from competitors. 

   K mart Corp., for instance, has hired cookbook and entertainment writer Martha Stewart to help design and sell private-label household goods. 

   But Spiegel, based in Oak Brook, Ill., appears to be going a step further by devoting an entire catalog -- albeit a slim one -- to items selected by a celebrity. 
The book is an outgrowth of a recent Spiegel ad, featuring an unusual candleholder with a monkey on the base that Ms. Bergen actually bought from Spiegel last November. 
The understated ad, which ran last spring in such magazines as Vogue and Metropolitan Home, did better at drumming up new customers than Spiegel expected. 

   "Most retailers have used celebrities simply as a means to hype products," say Robert Parker, the catalog company's director of sales promotion. 
"What we've done is used a celebrity, based on her real behavior, and asked her to help us edit a Christmas gift book." 

   The book, entitled "Candice Bergen's 42 Last-Minute Christmas Gift Ideas," will be mailed in November to one million of Spiegel's five million active customers. 
In an introductory note, Ms. Bergen will explain why she likes shopping by catalog, especially during the busy Christmas season when stores are swamped. 
She will go on to promote 42 clothing and decorative items, including a leather bomber jacket, a watch and a gum-ball machine. 

   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said Ms. Bergen could help Spiegel because her television show, "Murphy Brown," is extremely popular. 
Her character, a busy television journalist, is successful and has little time to shop. 
"She probably capsulizes what their customers would like to be like," Mr. Tashjian adds. 

   Three quarters of Spiegel's customers are, in fact, working women. 
"Today's busy woman is inundated with options and choices," says the company's Mr. Parker. 
"What she's looking for is somebody to simplify her life and edit for her. 
We thought that Candice Bergen would be the perfect choice." 

   Mr. Parker added that Spiegel, the nation's third-largest catalog company with sales of $1.4 billion last year, doesn't expect the new catalog to have a big impact on profit. 
"What we're really looking at is image value and understanding how to build a stronger relationship with our customers," Mr. Parker said. 
He described the gift book as "sophisticated and understated," and said Ms. Bergen's picture won't appear in it. 

   Mr. Parker declined to say how much Spiegel will pay Ms. Bergen for choosing the items and lending her name to the project. 
Over the past two years, Spiegel has also run ads featuring items purchased by Jacqueline Bisset, Priscilla Presley and Bianca Jagger. 

   Eighty-four percent of Spiegel's stock is owned by the Otto family of West Germany. 
The family also controls Otto-Versand G.m.b.H., one of the largest mail-order houses in Europe.

Home writer Martha Stewart has angered some in her hometown for refusing to 
disclose how much she raised for charity through a benefit decorator show 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The show house was open for 20 days in May to benefit the Hole in the Wall Gang 
Camp Fund, a charity for seriously ill children and their families founded by 
Stewart's Westport neighbor, Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
The show house and other events raised $210,000 for the charity, Stewart told 
The Advocate of Stamford. But she won't say how much was raised specifically 
through the house. 
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 people visited the house for $15 each, which would make the gross 
proceeds $135,000. Stewart said the house turned a profit for the camp, but 
that volunteers and visitors do not have a right to know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should give the dollar amount," Stewart said. "They all got 
$15 worth of information out of that house. Think of it this way: It's like 
going to the movies."

<HEAD>K mart Dreaming of `Green' Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As part of an ambitious holiday sales campaign
that has the nation's second biggest retailer dreaming about a
``green'' Christmas, K mart Corp. has hooked up with NBC on a
television special.
   The holiday promotion is tied to a central theme that will be
reinforced with store signs, print and broadcast advertising and a
new song sung by Kenny Rogers, who stars in the TV show.
   Retailers usually pull out all the stops to pump up Christmas
sales because the season generates about half of their annual
profits.
   This year's peak shopping season will be particularly important
for K mart because the discounter didn't do as well as it might
have liked during the first half of 1989. Income sagged nearly 16
percent to $239 million in the first six months from $284 million
in 1988's first half.
   ``Christmas 1989 is going to be a very competitive year, there's
no doubt about it,'' said Michael G. Wellman, K mart's vice
president of marketing. ``For those retailers that really have a
strong merchandising and marketing program, Christmas will be very
merry.''
   Wellman said K mart's preparations, built around one main theme,
should put the retailer in a strong position to capitalize on
seasonal business.
   With a chain of 2,200 general merchandise stores spanning 48
states, K mart estimates that half of the U.S. population shops at
its stores each month.
   K mart is relying on a variation of the holiday theme it used
last year, taken from the book ``Christmas in America,'' a coffee
table pictorial of festivities and slices of life from around the
country.
   The book, which was in general distribution and sold at K marts
and the retailer's Waldenbooks stores, proved popular, earning a
place on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for several
weeks running.
   The special to be aired on NBC during prime time the week of
Dec. 10, ``Christmas in America _ A Love Story,'' stars
singer-entertainer Kenny Rogers as a professional photographer.
   In the hour-long drama _ undoubtedly written for maximum
heartstring tugging at an emotionally charged time of year _ Rogers
flashes back on his life via his photographs, which are on exhibit
at a museum. Some of the photographs used in the TV special are
from the ``Christmas in America'' book and others are Roger's own.
   Roger's screen son is played by his real-life son, Kenny Rogers
Jr., and his wife by actress Ashley Crow.
   The film was produced by King World Productions Inc. and is the
first advertiser-supported network project for the King World
division formed last year to develop and produce original
programming sponsored by advertisers. King World distributes
several top syndicated programs, including ``Wheel of Fortune,''
``Jeopardy!'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
   Barbara Loren, an advisor to K mart who is coordinating the
Christmas campaign, said the role the retailer played in bringing
the special to TV was unprecedented. It also represents a new twist
in a trend toward retailers and networks working closely together
on promotional efforts.
   K mart and CBS formed an alliance ahead of the new TV season
that had the two-fold purpose of boosting the retailer's
back-to-school business and touting the network's program lineup.
Retail industry leader Sears, Roebuck and Co. had a similar matchup
with NBC.
   The results are still coming in but the early readings indicate
the retailers benefited from their partnerships.
   ``There's nothing that we have seen to imply that this has been
anything less than a pretty successful promotion,'' Wellman said in
an interview. K mart and other major general merchandise chains,
department and specialty stores will report their September sales
on Thursday.
   Loren, president of the retail consulting firm Loren-Synder
Marketing Inc., said K mart helped initiate the TV special because
last year it had secured the film rights to the ``Christmas in
America'' book.
   Usually, a network owns a production and seeks advertisers to
support the programming. In this case, it was K mart executives who
pitched the idea to NBC, Loren said.
   The TV special is part of K mart's Christmas promotion, which
includes a range of marketing reinforcements to get across its
theme. Pictures of Kenny Rogers will be prominent in K mart stores
and a new song he has recorded, written by Dolly Parton, will be
piped over stores' public address systems.
   Loren said the mood of the country is such that the ``Christmas
in America'' ballad could become a hit.
   ``We are going to a traditional, conservative decade,'' she
said. ``The country is ready for the next `White Christmas.'''

King World Productions, which distributes "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!," 
is venturing beyond its normal syndication base with its first 
advertiser-supported network TV project, "Christmas in America: A Love Story." 
Kenny Rogers will star in the drama that will air on NBC and be sponsored by K 
mart. The special, inspired by last year's best-selling photo anthology, finds 
Rogers as a globe-trotting photographer who looks back on his life. Rogers 
himself is an amateur photographer. King World and K mart also are tied to 
another holiday special featuring Martha Stewart, author-lecturer and K mart 
spokeswoman, scheduled to air in November and December on Lifetime cable.

SIMPLE SECRET TO CREATING AN INVITING BRUNCH TABLE

Martha Stewart, author and authority on entertaining in the home, advocates 
using collectible china to create an inviting table. 
</P>
<P>
For a brunch, which she describes as "a perfect way to entertain informally," 
she suggests a table of unusual china or pottery, one-of-a-kind glassware, 
mix-and-match flatware. 
</P>
<P>
"Different styles, patterns and shapes play off each other well if color and 
size coordinate," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a member of the Great Entertainers Council formed by Champagne 
Perrier-Jouet four years ago as a source of information on entertaining styles 
and trends, also offers these suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Special Touches 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fresh flowers, whether a single perfect bloom, a spray of daisies or a 
potted plant from the garden, are a must. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amusing salt and pepper shakers, or a trio of dainty pottery pitchers 
accent a brunch table wonderfully. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yellow, blue and green look especially good on a breakfast or luncheon 
table. Use brightly hued cloth napkins or pretty dish towels; if buffet style, 
roll each guest's utensils in a napkin and tie with ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Butter molds in interesting shapes add a special touch to the table and are 
a cinch to do ahead. Maple sugar butter is delicious on French toast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make one or two special breads ahead of time and freeze them until the 
night before the party. Easier still, buy wonderful breads to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make the presentation beautiful; small details bring style to even the 
simplest fare. Carefully peel 4-minute eggs and place on wedges of toast; 
garnish French toast with a twist of sliced orange; serve creamy cafe au lait 
for a special treat. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, whose most recent book is "Quick Cook Menus," espouses entertaining at 
brunch because "you can have fun with a variety of dishes, you can do most of 
the preparation in advance and, best of all, it's less stressful than trying to 
entertain midweek."

   Little Richard, usually never at a loss for
words, choked up when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame.
   The flamboyant rock idol and lay evangelist wore dark sunglasses
and an all-black outfit Thursday, when he was greeted by hundreds
of shouting well-wishers at a ceremony.
   He lost his composure moments after he was introduced. With his
face hidden in his hand, he took about a minute to recover.
   ``I just want to say I'm really grateful to be here. I've been
waiting a long time,'' he said.
   Little Richard, 57, whose real name is Richard Wayne Penniman,
became a legend with such hits as ``Tutti Frutti,'' ``Lucille'' and
``Good Golly Miss Molly.''
   He also has appeared on television and in movies, including
``Down and Out in Beverly Hills.''

   Isiah Thomas couldn't resist a little Dan
Quayle bashing during a trip to the White House with his fellow
Detroit Pistons.
   Thomas, most valuable player in the NBA finals, poked fun at the
vice president during a ceremony Thursday for showing up at two of
the team's worst games all year.
   ``Thanks for all your support,'' Thomas said. Quayle grinned and
waved his arms in protest.
   President Bush paid tribute to the Pistons for their second
consecutive championship victory. The team got to go to the White
House the first time, too.
   ``I think they're going to have to give us a wing,'' Thomas
said. ``They have an East Wing and a West Wing, Now they'll have a
Piston Wing.''
   Bush got a few good-hearted licks in during a Rose Garden
ceremony.
   Bush called Piston bad boy Bill Laimbeer ``my old friend Mr.
Congeniality.''

   A model and a boxing promoter
have been accused of attempting to extort money from the father of
tennis star Steffi Graf, newspapers have reported.
   Nicole Meissner, 22, allegedly tried to extort $295,000 from
Peter Graf, claiming that he fathered her child born in January,
the West German newspaper Bild quoted a Frankfurt prosecutor as
saying.
   Meissner and boxing promoter Eberhard Thurst were arrested
Tuesday at a Frankfurt airport, the newspaper Berliner Morgenpost
said.
   Bild said Meissner later withdrew the allegations after an
investigation was launched. The two remained in custody Thursday,
pending the outcome of the investigation.
   Graf, 21, who is from West Germany, is the world's No. 1 player.

   David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the designers who
soared to fame with the wedding dress they created for Princess Di,
are ending their marriage and their professional relationship.
   British newspapers reported Thursday that Elizabeth will
continue to design under the Emanuel label and wants to launch a
ready-to-wear collection, while David wants to start his own
couture label and hopes to expand his interest in photography.
   A statement issued by the couple Wednesday night said only: ``In
due course we will announce our individual plans for the future.''
   The commission to make Diana's dress for her 1981 wedding to
Prince Charles made the Emanuels household names. They amassed an
array of celebrity clients.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Romance and Fragrance in Chicken Coup and Garden

   I suppose it was inevitable that the Martha Stewart book
empire (entertaining, hors d'oeuvres, pies and tarts,
weddings, Christmas) would colonize gardening, the nation's
No. 1 hobby. The result is "Martha Stewart's Gardening"
(Clarkson Potter, 360 pages, $50), a jumbo book, in which she
does her sunny best to make this new turf HERS.
   In the 125 photographs of her, Ms. Stewart is seen with
"my secateurs," "my favorite hoe," "my bees," "my barn," "my
own chickens," "my beautiful poppies and irises," "my chow
chow," and an occasional dirt smudge on HER khakis, in HER
six-acre Westport, Conn. garden, which looks a lot like Laura
Ashley wallpaper recently planted-out plein-air.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not so long ago, Ms. Stewart told James Dodson of "Yankee
Magazine" that "Gardening could be to the '90s what food and
sex were to the '80s." Not surprising then, that she calls
herself a "passionate gardener" and that her publisher feels
compelled to tell us "she has actually done all of the things
she writes about." Garden-variety gardeners might wish she
hadn't, because Martha Stewart's "sex of the '90s" as
gardening leaves something to be desired, particularly the
chapter on roses. Ms. Stewart is better at identifying her
fine vessels ("a nineteenth-century bronze urn," "a sterling
silver Revere trophy bowl") than the roses she's stuffed into
them. The "white climber `Inspiration'" on page 154 is pink
and not "Inspiration," the "pink . . . gallica" on page 162
is a bourbon and not "Georges Vibert," the "White Dawn" on
page 163 is pink and could be "Cecile Brunner," and the "pink
centifolia `Fantin Latour'" on page 168 is a bourbon.
   Ms. Stewart's rose-planting instructions are also addled
for someone offering advice with such enthusiasm. She
demonstrates mounding "the soil to just below the graft" --
the perfect way to winterkill the grafted-on rose. (Even in
California gardeners plant the graft union below ground, to
give the graft a chance to put down its own roots). And, at a
time when experts increasingly repudiate peat as a soil
amendment, she recommends it frequently, even for planting
clematis, though clematis are notorious antacid plants. Does
she realize that the "dried gray poppy pods" she uses to add
"some bulk to each little bag" of potpourri are opium poppy
pods? And absent any evidence, has she really "had great luck
in growing even the rarest blue Meconopsis?"
   According to her publisher, "she is a woman who believes
that domestic life is worth living and worth living well."
Does she ever. Living well includes 884 sacks of buckwheat
hull mulch (some $9,000 worth), 400 pounds of triple
superphosphate, 200 pounds of granular lime, 200 pounds of
510-10 fertilizer and 75 cubic yards of "Mr. Bulpitt's
special enriched compost." Even her "20 to 30 breeds of
chickens" live well. "After we built the Palais des Poulets .
. . I planted {rose} climbers here and there to offer some
romance and fragrance to the chicken yard."
   More sensible gardeners will prefer Collier Books'
American Garden Classics reissue of the 1935 "What Happens In
My Garden" (258 pages, $10.95) by Louise Beebe Wilder, whose
astute writing serves as a perfect antidote. "We are afraid
of that word `weed.' . . . Weeds, it might be said, are
Nature's sins of commission, and we as a nation are pledged
to blot out sins -- of commission rather than omission. Hence
we do not countenance weeds," Wilder wrote with typical
humor.
   Going back a bit further, I became pleasantly lost in "The
Golden Age of American Gardens: Proud Owners -- Private
Estates -- 1890-1940" (Abrams, 408 pages, $75). With
high-toned irony and a wicked sense of absurdity, Mac
Griswold and Eleanor Weller take off from Edith Wharton's
1905 observation: "The American landscape has no foreground
and the American mind has no background."
   "Garden making, in 1890 as before, was a popular arena for
the display of new prosperity . . . a beautiful garden had
the same social utility as good horses, a box at the opera,
or magnificent dinner parties," they write of Gilded Age
gardening, when money was "the best manure."
   Having bestowed their family manses with grandly redolent
names (Afton Villa, Canterbury Manor, Glen Elsinore, the
owners then employed a "horticultural mafia" of "highly
trained English and Scots gardeners." At such Pacific
Northwest estates of the "sawdust aristocracy" as Lakewold,
Eulalie Wagner kept precocious tulips back by topping "off
their beds with cakes of ice." In 1930 the ladies of the
Garden Club of America treated themselves to "a trip across
Lake Washington on a barge disguised as a formal garden with
flower beds, gravel paths, and park benches." Nobody blinked
when the wife of "the mattress czar of the Northwest" turned
acres of virgin forest near Tacoma into a Japanese garden,
importing the required stones, plants, temple lanterns and
Japanese gardener.
   Returning to the present, yet another Connecticut
gardener, Judy Glattstein, has put her particular passion,
leaves, to print this year in "Garden Design With Foliage"
(Garden Way Publishing, 224 pages, $17.95). Leaves, writes
Ms. Glattstein, are "the workhorses of the plant world" and
contribute most to "the gestalt of a garden." (It follows
that "overemphasis on flowers, to the neglect of foliage" is
antigarden gestalt.)
   "Only after we decide which leaf shapes to combine can we
advance to the second level of choices -- color -- and
conclude our aesthetic decisions," she notes sternly.
   A passing grade should let you advance to "Rosa Rugosa"
(Capability's Books, 90 pages, $19.95), Suzanne Verrier's
defense of these hitherto no-account Cinderellas. Despite
their "vigor, hardiness, disease and pest resistance, varied
blossom colors and forms, fragrance, rebloom, attractive
foliage, fall color, hips, winter interest, and good growth
form" (and salt tolerance), this is their first book.
   Her rose has always been slighted and she resents it. "One
is struck by the lack of enthusiasm with which the Europeans
greeted the rugosas" upon their late 18th century
introduction from the Far East. "The immediate response was
criticism citing coarseness, excessive vigor, and lack of
refinement . . . Most extraordinary of all, no one praised
the repeat bloom." Not that she is blind to flaws. "Topaz
Jewel" gets a full page photo, but a stiff rejection: "Yellow
rugosas are always greeted with much fanfare. Rarely is the
acclaim deserved. Despite my distrust, I purchased this rose
and it has been a disappointment . . . a rose whose modern
name itself is unpleasant."
   Martha Stewart and Judy Glattstein have not been alone
trowelling through Connecticut on a publisher's advance.
There was also Michael Pollan, who gardens in Cornwall Bridge
and has produced the finest collection of "green thoughts"
since Eleanor Perenyi (another Connecticut gardener) rounded
up hers in 1981. "Second Nature: A Gardener's Education"
(Atlantic Monthly Press, 258 pages, $21.95) includes 12
essays ranging from "Nature Abhors a Garden" to the hilarious
"Why Mow?" -- which decribes Mr. Pollan's secession from the
American Church of the Suburban Lawn. "I became convinced
that lawn care had about as much to do with gardening as
floor waxing," he writes.
   The thinking gardener's gardener, Mr. Pollan is
wonderfully adept at doing gardening as a form of
cerebration. Not long on the land he noticed "the halo of
righteousness {hovering} over compost and those who make it."
That launched him into pondering "Compost and Its Moral
Imperatives." In it, he concludes that "The apotheosis of
compost is really just the latest act in a long-running
morality play about the American people and the American
land." Eventually he gets religion. He starts a compost.
"Right then I realized that, like it or not, I was an
American gardener, likely to cultivate in the garden more
virtue than beauty."

   Marketing:
   Downscale Consumers, Long Neglected,
   Start to Get Some Respect From Marketers

   Homer Simpson, the decidedly downscale patriarch of Fox
Broadcasting's "The Simpsons," has become a pop icon. So has
Roseanne Barr, the proletarian star of ABC's hit series
"Roseanne."
   Regular folks are back in fashion, a fact that hasn't
escaped the attention of some of the nation's most powerful
marketers. Blue-collar and other nonprofessional people have
always represented a vast and loyal group of consumers. But
now, with growth in most upscale markets slowing to a crawl,
more companies than ever are viewing them with renewed
respect.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider: McDonald's Corp. features working stiffs in new
TV commercials. Burger King Corp. plans to use cartoon
characters from "The Simpsons" in promotions. A Southern
cable operator has revamped its marketing to lure low-income
viewers. Clothing maker Gitano Group Inc. cultivates a trendy
image, but focuses its products and prices on middle America.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. advertises some of its top brands in
the National Enquirer.
   Of course, it wouldn't make sense to peddle luxury items
to consumers who can't afford them. But for most of the past
decade, Madison Avenue has been loath to target downscale
markets for even mundane products. In part, that's because
advertisers like to show their products as part of an
affluent life style.
   Some critics also attribute the lack of interest to a
cultural bias on the part of image makers, who often create
marketing campaigns that tend to reflect their own life
styles more than the lives of average consumers. "Nobody
wants to work on a downscale product," says a New York ad
executive. "We're all pretty upscale people, and we all wear
the prestige products we've worked on on our sleeves."
   It's hard to dispute the demographic appeal of Middle
America. The average household earns about $34,000 a year,
according to the most recent Census Bureau figures. That may
not be in a league with gilded yuppiedom, but because of
their numbers, households that live on that figure or less
control more than 30% of total income in the U.S.
   Moreover, middle-class consumers may respond to
down-to-earth pitches in growing numbers because more are
feeling squeezed. Since the early 1970s, family incomes have
hardly managed to stay ahead of inflation. For baby boomers
starting out, that makes upward mobility more difficult.
Allow for climbing health-care costs, property taxes and
tuition bills rising much faster than inflation, and the
ranks of penny pinchers swell.
   "It's the phenomenon of the fading fortunate," says Carol
Colman, a partner in the New York consulting firm Inferential
Focus. "Marketers may have made the mistake of thinking
average Americans made $75,000, and now even that
aspirational group is feeling squeezed."
   The appeal of the blue-collar market goes beyond the
numbers. Despite their image as traitorous coupon clippers,
lower-income consumers may actually be more brand-loyal than
their wealthier counterparts. Because they can less afford to
make mistakes, experts say they're more likely to stick with
a brand that pleases them. "A brand is a safety net for these
groups," says Stewart Owen, director of research at Landor
Associates, a San Francisco image consulting firm.
   Marketers are trying a range of techniques to woo the
diverse downscale market. McDonald's, for example, exalts the
average guy in several new TV commercials created by Leo
Burnett Co. Though the nation's largest purveyor of meals for
the masses has never courted the silk-stocking set, several
ads rolled out in early May more pointedly reflect the modest
life styles of some of its customers.
   In one spot, a nervous suitor launches into a monologue on
his prospective date's doorstep. He's not a doctor or a
lawyer, he proclaims, but a record-store salesperson. The
awkward Romeo is eager to set the record straight on a few
other points: He doesn't wear designer clothes or go to
restaurants that refer to themselves as "bistro." The woman
is enchanted, of course, and happily follows him to the curb
-- where his 1980 Chevrolet Citation awaits.
   In another ad, a little girl waits for her mother to
return from work on a rainy night. When the woman --
apparently a single mom -- finally arrives looking exhausted,
the child reminds her of a promised meal at McDonald's. On
the way to the restaurant, the daughter listens to the
account of her mother's trying day at work. "We're saying
it's OK to be regular," says a McDonald's spokesman.
   Meanwhile, rival Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, seems to be sending the message that it's all right to
be a little weird. The fast-food chain plans a series of
promotions starting this summer based on "The Simpsons." A
spokesman for Fox confirms that Burger King has licensed the
characters Homer Simpson, a safety inspector at his town's
nuclear power plant, and his puckish son, Bart, to push
burgers.
   Other marketers are going much further. Birmingham Cable,
which operates cable-TV systems in Birmingham, Ala., and
nearby Bessemer, has repositioned its service to draw
working-class customers. Though the company was doing well
among upscale residents, lower-income people weren't hooking
up in large numbers -- bad news since such customers account
for about two-thirds of the population in the systems'
territories.
   Through a research firm that develops neighborhood
profiles, the cable operator found its territory includes a
cluster of neighborhoods occupied mainly by single adults and
one-parent families who earn an average of $15,000 a year.
Market research also showed that such consumers are put off
by complicated pitches.
   So, Birmingham Cable changed its approach. The company
ditched a glossy brochure, which had included a letter and a
response form, in favor of a brief appeal, and it began to
push the service as cheap family entertainment rather than as
a luxury. Response to the modified mailer more than doubled.
   The cable operator also started advertising its monthly
charges, rather than breaking the cost of the service down to
40 cents a day, a tactic customers found suspicious. "The
people in these market segments are very good money
managers," says Rod Clark, vice president of marketing at
Birmingham Cable. "They're worried about hidden costs."
   For many marketers, targeting the blue-collar brigades is
a matter of finding the right vehicle. Procter &amp; Gamble
places ads in some unexpected publications. For several
years, P&amp;G has been advertising some of its best-known brands
in the noisy pages of the National Enquirer. Tucked near the
tale of a woman who was run over by her own "van from hell"
in a recent issue was this unfanciful claim: "If it's got to
be clean, it's got to be Tide."
   Other marketers court downscale consumers by presenting a
middle-class or affluent image to which they can aspire.
Gitano Group spends some $15 million a year to promote its
women's clothing with slick ads in swanky publications such
as Vogue and Mademoiselle.
   But in fact, Gitano clothing is aimed squarely at the
discount crowd. The primary outlets for the company's wares
-- mostly women's tops and bottoms that sell for around $20
-- are mass merchandisers such as K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. And despite Gitano's trendy, youthful ads, most
of the clothes are cut to fit more mature bodies. Some of the
brand's big sellers are maternity clothes and jeans for
larger-sized women.
   General Mills Inc.'s Hamburger Helper brand of dinner
mixes uses a similar marketing illusion to create a
comfortable, middle-class image. The product, whose sales are
booming, was created in the mid-1970s, when meat prices
soared, as a way to stretch ground beef. But ads for the
boxed dinners stress convenience and taste over economy, and
often feature an affluent-looking suburban family.
   Despite the size -- and spending power -- of working-class
America, most marketers don't want their products associated
with the masses. "The marketing community has no aspirations
to address the needs of a demographic group of which it is
not a member," says John Quelch, a professor at Harvard
Business School who specializes in consumer marketing.
Indeed, most brand managers and ad executives have far more
in common with Mr. Quelch's students than with Roseanne or
Homer.

K MART UNVEILS PLANS TO ADD 700 STORES IN $1.3-BILLION EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

TROY, Mich.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini on Tuesday outlined a major 
$1.3-billion expansion plan designed to double sales and profits at the 
second-largest U.S. retailer and burnish its image. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini told a news conference that the expansion would be the biggest for the 
Troy, Mich.-based company since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
K mart, No. 2 behind Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. of Chicago, plans to add about 
700 stores through 1995 to its current roster of 2,275 K mart discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer also operates 1,815 specialty stores selling books, drugs, 
hardware and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants to Overtake Sears 
</P>
<P>
K mart, outlining its five-year strategy, told analysts last week that it was 
confident about its prospects for growth. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been seeking to improve profits and overtake Sears as the 
nation's largest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
But profit in the first half of 1989 fell nearly 16% to $239.1 million as 
revenue grew about 4% to $13.07 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini said in a speech Friday that the retailer's expansion plans are 
designed to yield sales of more than $50 billion by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said K mart is targeting annual net income of $1.75 billion by the 
mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, K mart reported earnings of $803 million on sales of $27.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the expansion program, Antonini said Tuesday that K mart will open 85 
to 100 new stores and an additional 100 stores will be expanded each year 
through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
He had indicated to analysts that an average of 20 to 30 of the stores will be 
replacements for small K mart outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini said capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion will be allocated for 
the expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
K mart also expects a positive fourth quarter, which includes the all-important 
Christmas shopping season, when many retailers post most of their profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect a very troublesome fourth quarter," he said. Antonini said his 
optimism is because the fall season is "shaping up better than anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Antonini said the company bases its projection in part on the fact that 
inflation remains under control and interest rates appear not to be too high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Media Mix 
</P>
<P>
The company last week said it expected to report a decline in third-quarter 
earnings from the year-earlier's $126.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to analysts, Antonini said K mart's strategy also includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of dominant life style departments. 
</P>
<P>
* More centralized merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased emphasis on everyday low prices. 
</P>
<P>
* Major capital investment in automation. 
</P>
<P>
* Growth and experimentation in non-discount store businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini also said the company is putting more emphasis on television 
advertising, cutting back slightly on print advertising. 
</P>
<P>
K mart stock closed down 25 cents a share at $38.50 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading.

GIFTS FROM THE HEART ARE GOOD IDEAS FOR HOLIDAY HOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JAPENGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some guests may tremble at the prospect of picking just the right holiday 
offering for that sophisticated host. But one recent visitor to the home of 
Colin Cowie, a Westside party designer and caterer extraordinaire, was not 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you told me that you love the apple tart from Michel Richard," the 
guest told Cowie, proffering the treat at his host's front door, "but I must 
apologize -- the maid took a big bite out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cowie, who was charmed by the flawed tart, tells the story to emphasize that at 
holiday parties, it's your presence, not your gift, that counts. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to get together, not to wait in anticipation to see what 
people are going to bring you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that assurance -- and the equally comforting advice from prime 
party-goers and etiquette sages that, in most cases, it's fine to show up 
empty-handed -- it still holds that an invitation to dinner during the holidays 
will leave most people groping at the last minute for the proper token to tote. 
</P>
<P>
The age-old instinct -- to bring wine or flowers -- has come under scrutiny in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Ford, author of an etiquette book and a manners column for McCall's 
Magazine, said guests should never bring flowers to a dinner party, although it 
is acceptable to send them later. Why? Because if presented with such a gift, 
"the hostess has to leave her guests and run and find a vase." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's is not the final word on this issue, as some other knowledgeable folk 
still prefer flowers to other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Scheips, whose holiday schedule sends him scrambling for a gift as many 
as five nights a week, says flowers make an evening of food and conversation 
less ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, you're gone but the flowers still are there," said Scheips, 
organizer of Art L. A. '89, an international art fair at the Convention Center 
Dec. 7-11. 
</P>
<P>
As for wine, still one of the most popular dinner gifts, many in the know now 
urge against this offering because it may undercut or befuddle the host who 
already has the beverage selected for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, the naysayers are not going unchallenged. Ford, for instance, says 
it's fine to take wine, just don't expect the host to uncork it that evening. 
That way no one has to worry about the selection clashing with the meal. 
</P>
<P>
If the function is formal, it's better not to take a gift at all but to send 
something before or after the event. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie's favorite pre-party gift is a box of Teuscher Champagne truffles flown 
in from Europe once a week and available for $18-$72 at the Teuscher store in 
Beverly Hills. He calls the chocolates the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have the time to do it, I make a basket and put in Christmas mince pies 
and almonds," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
But if he's rushed, Cowie might go with a tin of Williams-Sonoma Scottish 
shortbread (about $10), tied with a red or green ribbon. Party-goers en route 
to dinner engagements also breeze by the Williams-Sonoma stores around town for 
mustards, olive oils and Fini vinegar ($9 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
Another Cowie suggestion is the popular champagne and caviar gift baskets from 
Wally's Liquor Store in West Los Angeles. They run anywhere from $50 to more 
than $500. 
</P>
<P>
But what is most endearing to hosts these days is not the guest who drops $500 
on caviar but one who bakes a bundt cake, glazes walnuts, or hand paints an 
ornament. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, time is of the essence and what really is very special is if someone 
has taken time on a gift," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Ausman, chief of protocol for Los Angeles County, agreed, adding that 
the most cherished party offering these days is anything homemade. 
</P>
<P>
A good source of do-it-yourself ideas is Martha Stewart's new Christmas 
cookbook, she said. An item from Stewart's book Ausman recommends is the 
pomander, a scented orange made to be hung in closets or hallways during the 
holidays. You take an orange, stud it with cloves (adding the cloves is hard on 
the thumbs, Ausman said) then hang it up to dry and later roll it in cinnamon 
and other spices. 
</P>
<P>
Another inexpensive gift from Stewart's book is potpourri. Ausman said she 
saved all the flower petals from her daughter's wedding this year and now has 
lots of dried petals to stuff in potpourri pouches along with spices and 
scents. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Weiss, who attends many social functions in her dual roles as director of 
special events at the Music Center and president of the board of directors of 
the Downtown Women's Center, said a sure-fire gift is wrapping paper designed 
by artists. Some recipients find the paper so beautiful that they can't bear to 
use it as wrapping, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman and others also mentioned the Los Angeles County Museum store as a good 
source for this and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss cautioned that because of the tradition of giving to the host, anyone who 
entertains often during the holidays "can really end up with a bunch of weird 
things." Because of that, she noted that it has become more popular for guests 
to send a donation to a charity with a note to the host saying the offering has 
been made in honor of a particular holiday get-together. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are changing their feelings about conspicuous consumption," she 
said, adding that means a donation might be the best visitor's gift of all this 
year.

<HL> Retailers Just Can't Wait for Christmas --- Ads, Catalogs Have Been Out Since Summer </HL>

   Halloween is still two weeks away. 
But some retailers are already wearing their Santa Claus suits. 

   Retailers in recent years have tried to get a jump on the competition by decorating their stores or launching Christmas sales before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional holiday-season kickoff. 

   This year, however, the holiday hype is reaching new heights (or depths). 
Spiegel Inc. started suggesting in ads in August that its catalog customers shop for Christmas while at the beach. 
In the same month, R.H. Macy &amp; Co. opened a shop featuring Christmas ornaments at its flagship New York store. 
And K mart Corp., which started advertising Christmas gifts in July, has announced the most extensive holiday marketing program in its history. 

   Prompting such calendar-defying moves are intense competition and sluggish sales. 
By promoting Christmas earlier or devising more elaborate marketing strategies, retailers hope to position their stores or catalogs as the place to shop. 

   "There's more apprehension than I can ever remember on the part of stores," says Peter Glen, a retailing-industry consultant. 
"They're insecure." 

   Consumers have spent so little this year that many retailers' receipts have barely kept up with inflation. 
Stores are hoping for a big holiday sales surge, but the outlook is already getting cloudy. 
The Conference Board's consumer-confidence index fell sharply in September, showing the largest monthly decline since just after last October's stock market crash. 
And in its September survey of consumer buying plans, Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates, a Chicago market-research firm, found that the percentage of people who plan to spend less this Christmas increased sharply to 36% from 28% a year earlier. 

   Premature Christmas promotions, however, can be risky. 
Consultants say that while the efforts may improve fall sales, they could hurt business later on. 
And if shoppers get tired of seeing holiday merchandise, stores may have to discount the goods to sell them. 
Moreover, early promotions are apt to alienate traditionalists. 

   "It's robbing the holiday to improve fall," says Mr. Glen. 
"It's also spoiling Christmas for the customer." 

   Some retailers seem to agree. 
Among them is Nordstrom Inc., a Seattle-based department store chain known for its service. 
While the company declines to give specific reasons, it refuses to sell holiday ornaments or decorate its stores until the day after Thanksgiving. 

   But Christmas is so important to retailers -- it accounts for 35% to 55% of annual sales and profits, depending on the type of merchandise sold -- that some stores and catalog companies take their chances with early promotions anyway. 

   "We try to get {clients} thinking about Christmas earlier, because it extends the months they make money," says Richard Grunsten, president of Chicago-based GSP Marketing Services Inc., which produces catalogs for 24 retailers. 
By mailing Christmas books in both summer and fall, Mr. Grunsten explains, companies have a better chance of winning a larger share of shoppers' Christmas budgets. 
In effect, he says, the retailer gets "two Christmas seasons during the same Christmas." 

   Indeed, Jay Walker, president of a Ridgefield, Conn., catalog marketer called Catalog Media Corp., says consumers will receive more Christmas catalogs in December this year as mail-order companies try to compete with stores by promoting delivery by overnight couriers. 

   Shapiro &amp; Associates, which starts polling consumers in August about their Christmas buying plans, says it hasn't seen evidence of a backlash against early promotions. 
"If consumers in August are able to tell us what they're going to do this Christmas, it makes perfect sense for retailers to make a statement about Christmas" at that time, says George Rosenbaum, the firm's president. 
"You could probably even argue for July." 

   Spiegel says its summer ad was aimed at those shoppers it describes as "planners," who like to beat the holiday rush. 
The ad, which appeared in fashion magazines that hit newsstands in August, featured a wooden boat, filled with Christmas gifts, sitting on a beach at sunset. 

   "This is such an understated, elegant way of promoting the idea of shopping in the summer for the holidays that we don't see it tapping into any latent negative sentiment that late shoppers might have regarding an early promotion," says Rod Parker, Spiegel's market-program manager. 

   Some retailers are proceeding with more caution. 
Daniel's Jewelers, a privately held chain of jewelry stores in Southern California, is consciously avoiding naming the holiday in a promotion it launched this month. 

   The chain is trying to boost sales both now and during the Christmas season by offering $25 gift certificates to shoppers who make a purchase of at least $49.95 by Nov. 17. 
The certificates can be redeemed only in late November and early December, when Daniel's hopes shoppers holding them will make other purchases as well. 

   "We know we're gunning for Christmas business," says Howard Sherwood, a vice president and an owner of Daniel's. 
But, he adds, "for a lot of people, it may be offensive to start talking about Christmas in October." 

   Macy also shied away from such talk in naming the Holiday Market shop it opened in early August at its Manhattan store. 
Officials hope to make the shop a permanent store fixture, and they feared that using "Christmas" in the name wouldn't play well in April or May, when the shop will also carry flowers. 

   The shop has been stocked with Christmas ornaments since it opened, and sales have been "excellent," according to Thomas Dyjor, Macy's fashion director for home furnishings. 
He says the shop caters primarily to tourists. 

   K mart, meanwhile, has no qualms about blaring its holiday message. 
Two weeks ago, the big discount chain invited reporters to its Troy, Mich., headquarters to discuss its new Christmas in America marketing program. 
The news conference was followed by a Christmas luncheon, complete with gifts and a visit from Santa Claus. 
"We thought it was important that Christmas start early this year," says Barbara Loren, a marketing consultant to K mart. 
"This is a very competitive business." 

   The centerpiece of K mart's plan is an unusual arrangement with the publisher of a new coffee-table book called "Christmas in America." 
K mart has the exclusive right to use the book's title and some of its photos in advertising circulars and television commercials, as well as on billboards, in-store posters, shopping bags, merchandise tags and employee badges. 
K mart even plans to sell "Christmas in America" commemorative plates. 

   The book, published by the Collins Publishers Inc. division of William Collins Sons &amp; Co., features the work of more than 100 newspaper and magazine photographers who spent six weeks last year taking pictures of how Americans prepare for, celebrate, survive and clean up after Christmas. 
It will be sold by K mart and in bookstores starting this month. 

   K mart, which plans to launch the promotion Nov. 1, hopes to persuade people who already shop at its stores to make more of their Christmas purchases at K mart. 
The company expects its message to be so pervasive during the holiday season that Michael Wellman, vice president of marketing, notes only half-facetiously that "we're going to allow six people not to know that K mart is celebrating Christmas in America."

                      Cautious Consumers
   When consumers were surveyed last month about their family's Christmas shopping plans, only 29% planned to spend more this year on gifts than in 1987. The results of the survey:
                                    Sept. 1988   Sept. 1987

<HEAD>K mart Earnings Dip; Short-Term Sears Interest Part of Reason</HEAD>

   K mart Corp., the nation's second-largest
retailer, Monday reported a 22 percent decline in quarterly
earnings caused mainly by lower-than-anticipated sales, increased
costs and higher advertising expenses.
   The sluggish sales at K mart stores partially reflected consumer
interest in a heavily advertised new low-price policy at rival
retailer Sears, Roebuck and Co., an analyst said.
   K mart reported it earned $94.1 million, or 47 cents a share,
for the quarter ended April 26, down from $120.8, or 60 cents a
share, during the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the first quarter of its fiscal year were $6.07
billion, up 3.9 percent from $5.84 billion in sales during the same
time last year.
   The company said higher-than-anticipated costs, including some
advertising expenses, affected the earnings.
   Retail analyst Steve Dimaggio of William C. Roney &amp; Co. in
Detroit said the introduction of an everyday low price strategy at
Sears in late February contributed to the drop in K mart's
earnings. At that time, Sears, the largest U.S. retailer, closed
its doors to mark down the prices of nearly all of its merchandise.
   ``Sears hurt them a little bit,'' he said. ``I think we might
see some of this (loss) come back. There always is a one-time
curiosity of where consumers will go'' when price reductions are
announced.
   The deterioration in K mart's profit didn't come as a surprise;
the company previously said its sales had suffered for a variety of
reasons, particularly because of unusually cold weather in early
spring.
   ``A couple of weeks back, they kind of warmed up the market that
their first quarter was going to be below expectations,'' Dimaggio
said. ``So that helped them soften the blow.''
   The company said it paid more for advertising and to open new
stores while also having higher outlays for employee pensions.
   K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini called the results
disappointing. He said cooler-than-normal weather during March and
the first two weeks of April adversely affected sales of outdoor
patio goods and plants.
   ``We are encouraged by the marked improvement in sales in the
last two weeks of April and early May,'' Antonini said.
   K mart reported $27.8 billion in sales last year. The
corporation operates 4,106 stores nationwide, including 2,269 K
mart discount stores, 1,230 Waldenbooks, 137 Builders Square and
271 Pay Less Drug Stores.

   Executives at retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. made a
smart move this past week while their Campeau Corp. counterparts
scrambled to come up with cash to keep their department stores
running.
   They publicly reassured backers who had put money into Macy's
debt-financed buyout in 1986 that their investment was doing just
fine.
   Instead of ignoring the situation, Macy's tried to deflect the
shock waves rippling through the retail industry since Campeau
dropped a bombshell in disclosing a severe cash shortage.
   Big problems like Campeau's and nagging small ones that won't go
away have shaken the foundations under retailing and raised
questions about what it takes to thrive _ or even survive _ in a
business where so much rests on having the financial flexibility to
respond quickly to what customers want.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based retailing and real-estate company built
by an ambitious Robert Campeau, staved off an emergency last week
thanks to a money transfusion from a major stockholder.
   Obtaining the $250 million loan caused Campeau to lose control of
the company he founded and yield to others who might unwind the
strings of chain stores Campeau collected with heaps of borrowed
money.
   Campeau is trying to sell Bloomingdale's, its flagship property.
The company's properties alos include Burdines, Jordan Marsh,
Lazarus and Stern's.
   Even before Campeau's problems there were signs that things
weren't right in retailing.
   Australian-owned L.J. Hooker Corp., the owner of old-line
department stores B. Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller, sought refuge
in bankruptcy court after also running into trouble trying to stay
on top of a mountain of debt.
   The nightmares of Campeau and Hooker, heavily involved in
property development like Campeau, shows what can happen when
companies try to mix merchandise retailing with other businesses,
says Richard Echikson, chairman of Millburn, N.J.-based Retail
Consultants Inc.
   An exception is Crown American Corp., one of the country's major
shopping mall developers, which has had a happy experience as a
store owner. Since buying Hess's Department Stores of Allentown,
Pa., in 1979, Crown American has successfully expanded the chain to
72 stores from 17.
   Frank Pasquerilla, founder and currently chairman of Crown
American, has been praised for keeping people with retail-smarts in
charge at Hess's.
   ``Pasquerilla was smart enough to leave the merchant alone,''
says Echikson.
   Even retail titan Sears, Roebuck and Co. has been looking
vulnerable. It still could lose its No.1 ranking despite an
aggressive campaign to meet its discounting competitors head-on with
a low-pricing policy of its own.
   So far, Sears only seems to have spurred a price-cutting battle
that, while making bargain hunters happy, could have unpleasant
consequences for retailers who cut their profit margins to the bone
to maintain market share.
   Stephanie Shern of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young says Sears
hasn't emphasized rapid response in distribution, unlike
fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc., with its high-tech,
satellite-controlled communications system, or Toys R Us Inc., where
poor-selling games or gizmos aren't allowed to linger.
   ``The guys who understand how to buy that product and get it on
the shelves quickly without a lot of warehousing costs will do
best,'' Shern said.
   At No.2-ranked K mart Corp., the cardinal rule in retailing,
``Know your customer,'' seems to be getting confused.
   The discounter has forged unlikely alliances with
actress-cum-clothing-designer Jacqueline Smith, hostess
extraordinaire Martha Stewart and other luminaries to spruce up its
dowdy image. The risk? Alienating its traditional customers who are
thinking about price, not prestige.
   Retailers catering to specialized groups, such as
fashion-conscious women, seem to be doing well these days. Analysts
expect these niche merchants to continue flourishing if they're
willing to adapt, such as changing their presentation to suit a
maturing population of women shoppers.
   Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. seems to be doing just
that. Its flagship Limited stores have subtly changed the looks of
its merchandise while the kookier stuff for teeny-boppers is now
found in Limited Express shops.
   Old-fashioned courtesy is back in fashion among retailers.
Nordstrom Inc. seems to be prospering as it expands outside its
historic Western area by investing in polite employees who are
winning raves from patrons.
   What's going on in retailing is typical for a mature industry;
the solution to slow growth isn't as simple anymore as building
another store, says Shern, adding stores must come up with ways to
make themselves distinctive.
   Making matters more difficult for sellers is that buyers may be
losing interest in shopping. The go-go days are long gone for the
current economic cycle and people are busy enjoying possessions they
already own. Pent-up demand has been satisfied.
   Plus, grownup baby boomers with new families have decided it's
finally time to start saving up for junior's college education.
   ``There is greater restraint. Impulse and frivolous purchases are
way down,'' says Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail consultant
and publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report.
   In such an environment it's no wonder that Robert Campeau's dream
of a continent-spanning retail empire couldn't become a reality. But
Campeau's downfall wasn't just the outcome of a poor business
environment.
   With the benefit of hindsight, analysts say Campeau paid too much
when he laid out $6.6 billion for Federated Department Stores Inc.
in 1988 after spending $3.6 billion to get Allied Stores Corp. two
years earlier.
   Campeau misjudged retail sales prospects and made unrealistic
assumptions about cash flow at Federated and Allied, analysts say.
   Robert Campeau, having demonstrated a knack for property
development, apparently thought that if he excelled at building
stores he knew about what went on inside them.
   By contrast, Macy's, seems to be balancing its financial and
merchandising interests better, but of course only time will tell
whether it's making the right decisions.

   Time Warner Said
   To Set Staff Cuts

   NEW YORK -- Staff members at Time Warner Inc.'s magazines
are bracing for across-the-board cuts that are likely to
include the firing of close to 40 journalists at Time
magazine and the closing of a few of its small news bureaus.
   Reductions are expected to cut across all Time Warner
titles, which include Time, People and Sports Illustrated,
said union officials and some magazine group insiders. The
cuts will likely include employee buy-outs as well as
cutbacks in sales staff, long considered a safe bastion in
media companies.

<TEXT>
   Time magazine and its large editorial and sales staff have
been particularly targeted for cost cuts of as much as $10
million. Insiders at Time Inc. Magazines said the cuts are
expected to include 20 correspondents who are stationed at
domestic and international bureaus, eight staff writers or
associate editors and 10 people from Time's pool of reporters
and reporter-researchers. Some Time Warner insiders said the
magazine's one-person news bureaus in Miami, Houston and San
Francisco could close down.
   Asked about possible layoffs or buy-outs of staff, a Time
Warner spokesman said, "We are continuing to review staffing
levels on both the editorial and publishing sides. But that
has been an ongoing thing." He added, "There are a number of
scenarios being considered, but no definite decision has been
made," but declined to elaborate further.
   Cutting staff at Time magazine, in particular, could prove
to be a controversial move for the company. When the former
Time Inc. took on what is now about $11 billion in debt to
acquire Warner Communications Inc. in 1989, it depicted the
flagship magazine as the crown jewel of the company. At the
time of the merger, Time Warner executives publicly vowed
that the company wouldn't cut the work force, nor would key
assets be sold, regardless of the pressures the huge debt
load might bring.
   But the impending cuts, which may be announced after Time
Warner holds its annual meeting on Sept. 25, may be more a
response to a severely depressed advertising market, which
has whittled away at the profit margins of Time Warner's
major magazine titles.
   Advertising accounts for at least 50% of the annual
revenue at most of the magazines. But for the first six
months of this year, six of Time Warner's seven major
magazines reported substantial losses in ad pages compared
with a year earlier: Fortune was off 24%, Life was off 29%,
and Time was down 21%.
   Only Entertainment Weekly, a new magazine that isn't yet
profitable, was up, rising 6.4% in ad pages. Some staff
members said they are angry that the planned cutbacks are
coming just as Time Warner is weighing a new weekly edition
of Life and just after deciding to start up Martha Stewart
Living, a lifestyle monthly.
   It's unclear whether reductions also are set for other
divisions, such as those on the Warner Communications side.
Larry Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books, said there are no
planned staff cuts at his book division, Time Warner's large
trade book division, or as far as he knows at Little, Brown,
the company's other major trade book unit.
   Key Martin, a People magazine staff member and chairperson
of the Newspaper Guild at Time Warner, said the rumors of
staff cuts had circulated through the company for weeks. He
said he hadn't been told by any Time Warner executives of any
editorial layoffs, but that he fully expects them. "They
aren't denying, and they aren't telling, either," he said.
   The staff's fears increased last week when Time Inc.
Magazines eliminated four jobs in its Detroit sales office,
the result of a companywide restructuring of sales staff
started in June. Time Warner executives said Detroit, where
the cuts amounted to 20% of the sales staff, wouldn't be a
prototype for cuts at sales offices in other cities.

HOLIDAY HOSTS APPRECIATE PRESENTS THAT HAVE PRESENCE ABOUT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JAPENGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some guests may tremble at the prospect of picking just the right holiday 
offering for that sophisticated host. But one recent visitor to the home of 
Colin Cowie, a Westside party designer and caterer extraordinaire, was not 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you told me that you love the apple tart from Michel Richard," the 
guest told Cowie, proffering the treat at his host's front door, "but I must 
apologize -- the maid took a big bite out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cowie, who was charmed by the flawed tart, tells the story to emphasize that, 
at holiday parties, it's your presence, not your gift, that counts. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to get together, not to wait in anticipation to see what 
people are going to bring you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that assurance -- and the equally comforting advice from prime 
party-goers and etiquette sages that, in most cases, it's fine to show up 
empty-handed -- it still holds that an invitation to dinner during the holidays 
will leave most people groping at the last minute for the proper token to tote. 
</P>
<P>
The age-old instinct -- to bring wine or flowers -- has come under scrutiny in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Ford, author of an etiquette book and a manners column for McCall's 
Magazine, said guests should never take flowers to a dinner party, although it 
is acceptable to send them later. Why? Because if presented with such a gift, 
"the hostess has to leave her guests and run and find a vase." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's is not the final word on this issue, as some other knowledgeable folk 
still prefer flowers to other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Scheips, whose holiday schedule sends him scrambling for a gift as many 
as five nights a week, says flowers make an evening of food and conversation 
less ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, you're gone, but the flowers still are there," said Scheips, 
organizer of Art L. A. '89, an international art fair at the Convention Center 
Dec. 7-11. 
</P>
<P>
As for wine, still one of the most popular dinner gifts, many in the know now 
urge against this offering because it may undercut or befuddle the host who 
already has the beverage selected for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, the naysayers are not going unchallenged. Ford, for instance, says 
it's fine to take wine, just don't expect the host to uncork it that evening. 
That way no one has to worry about the selection clashing with the meal. 
</P>
<P>
If the function is formal, it's better not to take a gift at all but to send 
something before or after the event. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie's favorite pre-party gift is a box of Teusche Champagne truffles flown in 
from Europe once a week and available for $18-$72 at the Teuscher store in 
Beverly Hills. He calls the chocolates the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have the time to do it, I make a basket and put in Christmas mince pies 
and almonds," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
But, if he's rushed, Cowie might go with a tin of Williams-Sonoma Scottish 
shortbread (about $10), tied with a red or green ribbon. Party-goers en route 
to dinner engagements also breeze by the Williams-Sonoma stores around town for 
mustards, olive oils and Fini vinegar ($9 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
Another Cowie suggestion is the popular champagne and caviar gift baskets from 
Wally's Liquor Store in West Los Angeles. They run anywhere from $50 to more 
than $500. 
</P>
<P>
But what is most endearing to hosts these days is not the guest who drops $500 
on caviar but one who bakes a bundt cake, glazes walnuts, or hand paints an 
ornament. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, time is of the essence and what really is very special is if someone 
has taken time on a gift," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Ausman, chief of protocol for Los Angeles County, agreed, adding that 
the most cherished party offering these days is anything homemade. 
</P>
<P>
A good source of do-it-yourself ideas is Martha Stewart's new Christmas 
cookbook, she said. An item from Stewart's book Ausman recommends is the 
pomander, a scented orange made to be hung in closets or hallways during the 
holidays. You take an orange, stud it with cloves (adding the cloves is hard on 
the thumbs, Ausman said) then hang it up to dry and later roll it in cinnamon 
and other spices. 
</P>
<P>
Another inexpensive gift from Stewart's book is potpourri. Ausman said she 
saved all the flower petals from her daughter's wedding this year and now has 
lots of dried petals to stuff in potpourri pouches along with spices and 
scents. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Weiss, who attends many social functions in her dual roles as director of 
special events at the Music Center and president of the board of directors of 
the Downtown Women's Center, said a sure-fire gift is wrapping paper designed 
by artists. Some recipients find the paper so beautiful that they can't bear to 
use it as wrapping, she said.

<HEAD>CBS, NBC Plan to Shop For Viewers at Retail Stores</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Fixes style of ``K mart'' throughout.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC and CBS are going shopping for viewers next
fall at two of the nation's biggest retail outlets.
   Both networks are hooking up with retailers in ambitious
promotions that will tout the new television season that starts in
September through a combination of games, store displays, TV and
newspaper ads and direct mail.
   The alliances between NBC and Sears, Roebuck and Co. and between
CBS and K mart Corp. are the latest efforts by the networks to halt
the erosion of their audience to cable, independent TV outlets and
video tapes.
   Network executives hope that the promotions will encourage
people to tune in to the shows at least once, and possibly become
regular viewers.
   Advertising agency executives and network affiliates said it is
about time that the networks tried something new.
   The three major networks _ NBC, CBS and ABC _ claimed only 67
percent of the audience in prime time during the just-completed
1988-89 TV season, down from 70 percent in the 1987-88 season and
92 percent a decade ago.
   Joseph Ostrow, worldwide media director at ad agency Foote, Cone
&amp; Belding Communications in New York, said the networks have been
slow to recognize the the value of using a variety of marketing
techniques to boost viewership.
   In the past, the networks touted their shows simply by running
promotional spots on their own network or placing ads in newspaper
TV listings.
   ``They haven't gone to the full extent that a marketer would go
in selling a product,'' Ostrow said.
   Allen Banks, media director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising
Inc., said mass marketers like Sears and K mart are logical matches
for TV networks.
   ``A large percentage of the population shops in either or both
of those stores,'' he said. ``It's a nice marriage between a mass
medium and a mass marketer.''
   Both the NBC and CBS promotions include contests designed to
make people aware of the new network shows. Participants can win
prizes ranging from cars, video equipment and vacations to an
appearance on an NBC program.
   Sears and K mart will give space in their weekly newspaper
supplements to their network partners, who will use it to list
contest questions.
   Those playing the CBS game will have to watch specific shows to
see if they have won, while those participating in NBC's contest
will be able to find the answers in the advertising supplement
itself.
   Contestants may claim their prizes or drop off their entries at
the stores, which will be decked out with signs promoting the
networks. The retailers will have all of their display TV sets
tuned to the appropriate network.
   The networks, for their part, will tout their retail partners in
a barrage of television advertising promoting the contest and and
fall schedule.
   George F. Schweitzer, who oversees advertising and promotions at
CBS, said all three networks suffered last year when a script
writer's strike delayed the start of the fall season.
   As a result, he said, some people never saw some of the new
shows simply because there never was a clear start to the new
season.
   ``This is a way to create some of the hoopla and excitement as
there was in years past,'' he said.
   Alan Cohen, vice president of network marketing at NBC, said the
promotion has been designed so that NBC affiliate stations will be
able to tie in to the national promotion with local events of their
own.
   Sears stores will have opening night celebrations that will
feature some of the local NBC station celebrities. Audio tapes that
will be run in the stores will have gaps that can be filled with
the local station's call letters so it sounds like a network star
has made a recording just for that location.
   Schweitzer said CBS plans to outline similar programs for its
affiliates at an upcoming meeting.
   Ben Tucker, an executive of Retlaw Broadcasting Co. of Fresno,
Calif., and head of the CBS affiliates advisory board, said he see
``tremendous potential'' in the CBS-K mart association.
   ``It sells the benefits of our product in different ways than
they have done in the past,'' he said.
   Will two or possibly three network promotions dilute the value
of all of them, cluttering the airwaves and possibly even turning
viewers off?
   Saatchi's Banks said he doesn't think so, and expects more
promotional tie-ins for the major networks and advertisers.
   ``Magazines have been in this business of tie-ins for years and
the cable networks have as well. Advertisers are looking for any
additional spin they can get out of an advertising schedule,'' he
said.

<TEXT>     There are, however, some misleading ideas associated with sweet potatoes.
For one, some people refer to them as yams. Wrong. Others purchase a variety
of sweet potatoes and think they're buying yams. Wrong again.;   Botanically,
sweet potatoes and yams are different vegetables. Yams, however, are hardly
ever grown commercially in the United States, and it is unlikely you will come
across them in the market.;   The true yam might resemble a sweet potato in
color or shape, but it grows on a tropical vine and can weigh as much as 100
pounds.;   There are mainly two types of sweet potatoes grown in this country
-- soft-fleshed and firm-fleshed.;   The firm-fleshed sweet potato is the
paler of the two. It is tan in color and has a creamy, yellowish flesh. It has
a mealy, dry texture when cooked and lacks a real sweet taste unless it is
candied.;   In contrast, the bright, soft-fleshed sweet potato is moist and
sugary. Its jacket is copper-red and its flesh is orange to deep red. This is
the variety that often is advertised and sold under the name "yam.";   Here
are some recipes:;    SOUTHERN-STYLE SWEET POTATOES; 4 red sweet potatoes,
about 6 to 7 ounces each; 2 tablespoons butter; 2 tablespoons orange juice; 1
tablespoon honey; Salt to taste; 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans;   Preheat oven
to 425 degrees. Scrub potatoes well. Prick with a fork and bake for 40 minutes
to one hour, until done. Cut a horizontal slice from the top of each potato
and discard the peel from the slices. Scoop out each potato, leaving a thin
shell. Mash the potato flesh and add the butter, orange juice, honey and salt.
Continue mashing until mixture is smooth.;   Place the potato shells in a
baking dish large enough for them to fit comfortably. Spoon the mashed
potatoes back in the shells. Sprinkle with the pecans. Place back into the
oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until heated through. Makes four
servings.; (hbox);    CANDIED SWEET POTATOES; 4 medium red sweet potatoes; 4
tablespoons butter; 1/2 cup maple syrup; 1/4 cup brown sugar; 1/2 cup chopped
walnuts;   Scrub sweet potatoes well. Boil until soft. Drain, reserving a

crumbly, add a bit more water.;   Turn the dough out onto a large piece of
plastic wrap. Grasping the ends of the plastic wrap with your hands, press the
dough into a flat circle with your fists. This makes rolling easier than if
the pastry is chilled as a ball. Wrap the dough in the plastic and chill for
at least an hour.;   Lightly butter the pie plate you will be using or spray
it with vegetable cooking spray. On a lightly floured board, roll out the
pastry to a thickness of one-eighth inch. Place the pastry in a 9-inch pie
plate, and press it into the bottom edges and along the sides.  </TEXT>

@  There's Bad News in Stores
@  For Publishers This Fall

   Leading department stores say their newspaper-advertising spending will be flat this fall, bad news for publishers who have been hurt by a slowdown in retail-ad expenditures that has lasted more than a year. 

   The dreary prognosis is doubly disappointing because some observers have been expecting that recent strength in apparel sales and aggressive back-to-school merchandising would boost retail-ad spending. 
However, doubts about the economy, coupled with cost-cutting strategies now in place in many retail chains, have dimmed those hopes. 

   "There's no life out there," says John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
"We thought we'd see some gains in terms of retail linage, but it just isn't happening. 
The stores are becoming as cautious as their customers." 

   Mr. Reidy notes that while the profit picture for newspapers remains bright because of lower newsprint costs, owners are eager to see an increase in retail-ad spending, which accounts for half their annual revenue. 
"It seemed to many analysts that we would see some ups, but the ups aren't very vigorous, and surveys show they aren't likely to be vigorous," adds Mr. Reidy. 

   In order to entice advertisers in this dismal business climate, the Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St.Paul) has gone to unusual lengths for a metropolitan daily. 
For the first time in recent memory, it has allowed the sale of its entire third page, traditionally one of the most visible and essential news platforms in a newspaper; the page was bought on a six-day-a-week basis by the Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. division of Dayton Hudson Corp. 

   "The minute a reader opens the Star Tribune he sees our ad," says Stewart Widdess, senior vice president, marketing, at Dayton Hudson. 
"It's a big investment for us. 
But it's also great exposure." 

   But even though Dayton Hudson is increasing its newspaper-ad spending in Minneapolis, Mr. Widdess says the chain's newspaper expenditures will be flat in other markets this fall. 
Moreover, the company's total ad spending also won't increase. 

   Joel Kramer, executive editor at the Star Tribune, says the newspaper agreed to let Dayton Hudson have page three because the store gave up some space on page two. 
"This gave us an opportunity to introduce a half page news summary on page two, something we wanted to do," Mr. Kramer says. 

   Even special promotions don't necessarily mean more ad spending. 
In Chicago, Marshall Field &amp; Co. is launching a four-month tribute to the culture and design skills of France with a four-color, two-page spread scheduled to appear Sept. 10 in the Chicago Tribune. 
But despite the retailer's enthusiasm for the promotion, it hasn't boosted its ad budget this year. 

   "The newspapers have raised their rates in Chicago, so we'll actually be getting less space than last fall," says Janet Garrott, director of advertising for the 24-store chain. 
Although retailers traditionally spend from 0.05% to 7% of sales on advertising, Ms. Garrott says many are now trying to increase profits by cutting expenses. 
"It's an industry trend now," she says. 
Ms. Garrott notes that even though Marshall Field is holding the line on ad spending, it still outspends Bloomingdale's in Chicago by "$3 to one." 

   Bloomingdale's, a division of Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores, says total ad spending for the 18-store chain is running about the same as last year. 
In metropolitan New York, however, the store boosted its advertising 10% to 15% for the first nine months because management believes it is gaining market share. 

   "We may not continue the double-digit increases for the rest of the year, but we will show an increase over 1988," says Gordon Cooke, executive vice president, sales promotions. 
"You develop a gut instinct for what works, and right now we think newspaper advertising is helping us gain market in the New York area." 

   Sometimes newspapers reflect, as well as report, the changes in their communities. 
Such is the case here. 
Many attribute the lackluster market for retail-newspaper advertising to the mergers that have rearranged the biggest department-store chains in the country. 

   "Advertising isn't growing as fast as in past years, reflecting the acquisitions which have changed the retail industry," says Craig Standen, president of Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc., whose 900 newspaper members account for 85% of the daily-newspaper advertising business. 
"Retailers which have consolidated or refinanced have greater need for cash flow, which means discretionary expenses like advertising are cut." 

   Last year, the 1,600 dailies nationwide and 7,000 nondailies divided about $31.2 billion in advertising revenue, including inserts, Mr. Standen says. 
Retail advertising is the single largest category, followed by classifieds. 

   At least one publisher, Knight-Ridder Inc., is reporting a small increase in retail-ad spending. 
Jerome Tilis, vice president, marketing, for the newspaper chain, says his retail-ad dollars this year are up almost 5% and he expects to continue those gains through the end of the year. 

   "The first wave of consolidations in retailing is over," says Mr. Tilis. 
"Fall l989 will be the first season in two years that merchants will be trying to move goods across the counter as opposed to organizing balance sheets."

   As if hard-pressed newspaper publishers didn't have enough
problems, leading retailers say they have no intention of
spending their way out of the recession by increasing their
advertising for the key fall selling season.
   Instead, such chains as the Dayton Hudson department store
group and Saks Fifth Avenue are launching new catalogs aimed
at free-spending charge card customers, or sprucing up
point-of-sale displays. Those marketing dollars will come
from budgets once reserved for print ads and broadcast
commercials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Retail ad spending for fall will be down by 10% or more
this year, predicts Carl Steidtmann, chief economist of
Management Horizons, a retail consulting division of Price
Waterhouse. "The outlook for retail advertising is pretty
gloomy," he says. "Retailers are trying to get the people
already in the store to spend more, as opposed to spending
more to get the people in."
   He believes the shift from ads to catalogs and in-store
promotion reflects a significant change in consumer
attitudes. Customers say they have less time to shopand that
they enjoy it less. Most end up returning to stores that have
satisfied them in the past, instead of trying alternatives.
   "It's cheaper to expand the business by satisfying
customers who come into the stores than by trying to lure new
shoppers" with expanded advertising, Mr. Steidtmann says.
   Some say that's a short-sighted strategy. "Retailers who
cut back are making a mistake," contends George Rosenbaum,
chief executive of Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates, a Chicago
market research firm. "Just because people stop coming to
stores doesn't mean they aren't vitally interested in new
fashions and prices. Not only will advertising keep customers
current, it may be a good enough reason to convince them to
buy now."
   But few retailers have such strong faith. Dayton Hudson,
for one, will cut back on fashion advertising to try direct
mail. "The trap is thinking that if you do more advertising,
you'll do more business. But a lot of people tried to buy
their way out of the recession last year, and it didn't
work," says Stewart Widdess, a senior vice president with the
Dayton Hudson department store group.
   Retail advertising has been especially weak in print,
which accounts for about 85% of all ad spending. In
newspapers, retailers of all kinds reduced their ad spending
by 8% to $7.54 billion in the first six months compared with
a year ago, the Newspaper Advertising Bureau says. In
consumer magazines and Sunday newspaper magazines, spending
by department and specialty stores fell 18% to $106.7 million
in the first half, according to Leading National Advertisers,
an industry research company.
   Ad spending on spot television fared little better.
Department and specialty stores cut back 6.5% to $117.2
million for the first six months, based on figures from
Arbitron's Broadcast Advertiser Reports.
   Retailers have found comfort in other media. Dayton Hudson
department stores, for example, are adding a new 64-page fall
fashion catalog this year and sending it to 500,000 of their
best charge-card customers. Because the stores haven't
increased their ad budgets this year, the catalog dollars are
primarily coming from TV advertising.
   Saks Fifth Avenue, similarly, will spend a larger portion
of its ad budget on direct mail this fall. "We're
intensifying our use of catalogs to talk to our customers
rather than using mass media like magazines and newspaper,"
says Arthur Martinez, vice chairman. "We'd rather talk to
individual customers rather than masses of customers, and
catalogs let us reach our individual clients." Earlier in the
year, Saks took a conservative position on fall business, and
the retailer remains concerned about the economy.
   Some retailers will do little, if any, advertising this
fall. The AnnTaylor chain is holding its spending to one
small weekly ad in the New York Times. And Limited Stores is
forgoing any print or TV ads to concentrate its marketing
efforts on point-of-sale merchandising.
   Limited Stores has signed the sultry actress Joan
Severance of the canceled CBS series "Wiseguy." But instead
of using her on television, it will feature her in in-store
image photos. "We think the best advertising is
word-of-mouth," says Ed Razek, executive vice president of
the Limited Stores division of Limited Inc. "We're committed
to an older customer, and using Joan Severance as our model
will get that message across. She's a grown woman, not a kid
playing dress-up."
   Even retailers expanding their fall budgets are showing
greater diversity. Next month, Bloomingdale's will launch a
new "country" promotion featuring goods made in Italy. Part
of the mix will include newspaper ads and a 60-second TV
spot. But the chain is also putting ads on busstop shelters,
a first for such promotions. Likewise, an all-Italian catalog
is also a first. Some customers will receive it together with
a special 34-page book of photographs of Italy.
   "We've even done four film documentaries in which we
interview well known creative people in Italy," says John
Jay, an executive vice president at Bloomingdale's. Though
the retailer remains committed to print, he says, "We're
looking for alternatives."

   Y&amp;R Settles Complaint
                                                                                                       

   Young &amp; Rubicam settled a civil complaint with the Justice
Department for allegedly failing to report transactions
involving the Jamaica Tourist Board.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington,
said the agency violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act
from 1981 to 1986 by failing to disclose payments of $894,000
to a local agent in Jamaica, Ad Ventures. The Justice
Department said the money was nearly one-third the fee the
Jamaica Tourist Board paid to Y&amp;R.
   The settlement closes one more chapter in the agency's
embarrassing involvement with the tourist board. In February
1990 the agency pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
settle charges that it violated federal laws to win the
Jamaica Tourist Board's advertising account in 1981.
   A federal grand jury had earlier indicted Y&amp;R on charges
it paid kickbacks to Jamaican businessman Arnold Foote Jr., a
principal in Ad Ventures, to help the agency win the account.
The indictment charged that Mr. Foote in turn bribed Eric
Anthony Abrahams, at the time Jamaica's minister of tourism,
to award the account to Y&amp;R. Although charges against Mr.
Abrahams have been dropped, the charges against Mr. Foote
remain in force.
   As a result of the current complaint, Y&amp;R is required to
disclose payments it made to Ad Ventures over the six-year
period, and to disclose any similar payments in the future
relating to representation of foreign clients.
   A Y&amp;R spokesman said he believed the agency wasn't
required to list the payments in question, but had agreed to
do so to settle the matter. Under the agreement, Y&amp;R neither
admitted nor denied the allegations of the complaint.

   DIAPERS: A California company will stop claiming that its
disposable diapers will decompose in a landfill before the
children who wore them grow up, under an agreement with the
Federal Trade Commission. American Enviro Products of
Placentia, Calif., has claimed that its "Bunnies" diapers,
marketed nationwide, will break down in three to five years
when disposed of in a landfill. The company will still be
allowed to make some environmental claims about the diapers,
but can no longer suggest that they offer a significant
environmental benefit over other disposable diapers.
                                                                                                       

   BANKS: C&amp;S/Sovran awarded its estimated $20 million ad
account to Bozell's Dallas office. GSD&amp;M of Austin, Texas,
had won a pitch for the account last month, but its victory
was clouded by the bank's merger agreement with NCNB. Bozell
already handles the estimated $30 million account for NCNB,
which is merging with C&amp;S/Sovran to form NationsBank.

   Several Large Mall Retailers Report
   Better-Than-Expected Sales for March

   Several mall retailers reported better-than-expected sales
for March, given this year's late Easter holiday season.
   Analysts estimate sales at stores open at least a year
rose an average of 3% to 4%, or about the same rate as
inflation. But the analysts said the results suggest April's
showing will be much stronger because of Easter's shift into
April this year from late March. The analysts, who favor
combining the two months for comparison purposes, predict a
same-store increase averaging about 6% for the period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The numbers show a great deal of underlying strength in
spending," said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. "In the
beginning of February, most people thought consumer spending
was going to be quite sluggish."
   The March results also suggest that department stores and
mall specialty stores that sell apparel may be gaining market
share. "Malls are doing better than strip centers," said
Thomas Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. "All of the
price promotions and additional advertising in the fourth
quarter has clearly brought consumers back into the mall, and
they are staying there."
   Mr. Tashjian and other analysts noted that mall stores are
ringing up respectable sales gains now, without having to
slash prices as often as they did over the Christmas season.
"There appears to have been a decline in promotional
activity," said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities.
   Because of a difference in their fiscal calendars, only
about half of the nation's big retailers reported March sales
yesterday. Gap Inc. led the pack with a 12% increase in
same-store sales. Limited Inc.'s same-store sales rose a more
modest 4%, disappointing some analysts.
   Last week, several big retailers, including Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co., Woolworth Corp. and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., reported
generally weaker results. Two exceptions were Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and J.C. Penney Co., where same-store sales rose 12% and
8.7% respectively.
   K mart Corp., a big discount chain, said sales at stores
open at least a year in the U.S. and Canada declined 1.1%. K
mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said "sales were strong in the
first two weeks of March," but "weakened in line with
expectations" because of the late Easter holiday.
   Same-store sales rose 8.2% at Dayton Hudson Corp., which
operates the Target and Mervyn's discount chains in addition
to its Dayton Hudson department store division. At May
Department Stores Inc., same-store sales rose 2.7%. Neiman
Marcus Group Inc.'s same-store sales rose 2.3%. And Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said its same-store sales declined
2.4%.

<HEAD>Retailer Teams With CBS for Promotion of Network's New Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bid to generate excitement for CBS' fall
television programs and gain publicity for K mart Corp., the TV
network and the retailer plan a big national promotion tied to the
September premiere of CBS shows.
   The promotion will be built around a viewer involvement game and
will be plugged on the CBS TV network, on CBS radio and in national
magazines, newspapers and in special K mart Sunday newspaper
circulars.
   Game cards and instructions will be distributed nationwide in K
mart Sunday circulars for three weeks. K mart and CBS will alert
viewers in print and via electronic media how to play and which
shows to watch.
   More than 6 million prizes will be offered, including 12 grand
prizes that include mini-vans and family vacations to Hollywood.
Most of the prizes can be redeemed at the 2,200 K mart stores
nationwide.
   The promotion, described in a news release as the largest ever
in TV history and one of the biggest general mass merchandise
pitches in retail history, has a two-fold purpose.
   For CBS, it apparently is intended to encourage viewers to
switch on the network's new schedule and hopefully get hooked while
playing the game.
   ``We'll involve huge numbers of viewers in an exciting way to
generate tremendous awareness and attention for our new programs
and our new schedule,'' said George F. Schweitzer, a CBS senior
vice president who oversees the network's advertising, promotion
and publicity. ``Nothing on this scale has been attempted before.''
   Jerry K. Habeck, K mart's director of advertising, said the
retailer is hoping to win new customers through the promotional
link with CBS.
   ``When our agency ... suggested we use our stores as media
outlets to develop a major promotion ... with a network, we saw it
as an opportunity to further enhance our image and gain recognition
as the place where America shops for everyday low prices on quality
items,'' Habeck said.
   K mart, the second largest retailer in the country, has been
facing stiffer competition since industry leader Sears, Roebuck and
Co. introduced a new low-pricing policy earlier this year.
   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer, which has conducted promotions
with celebrities including actress Jaclyn Smith and golfer Fuzzy
Zoeller, will display advertisements for CBS' programs in its
stores.
   Special CBS videos about its new programs will be aired in K
marts and all TV monitors in K marts' electronics departments will
be tuned to local CBS affiliates. Celebrity appearances and other
in-store activities are planned.
   K mart apparently isn't concerned about possible negative
consequences if new CBS shows lag in ratings.
   A K mart official who asked not to be identified by name said no
one can predict how the new shows will fare and the retailer is
just intending to capitalize on the excitement at the beginning of
the season.
   Schweitzer of CBS said K mart has not been granted an option to
preview the fall lineup and the network doesn't anticipate that its
shows will be objectionable to anyone. ``This network doesn't have
those kind of problems to any large degree,'' he said.
   Numerous advertisers recently have yanked their commercial
support from programs after special interest groups complained
about the contents.
   The amount of money CBS and K mart will spend on the promotion
was not disclosed.

<HEAD>K mart's Profit Up 12 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. reported that its profit after
taxes rose 12 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
helped by modestly higher sales and an advertising campaign.
   The nation's second-largest retailer said Monday that its
second-quarter profit increased to $162.8 million, or 81 cents a
share, from $145.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Sales for the second quarter ended July 27 were up 6 percent, to
$6.68 billion from $6.30 billion a year earlier.
   ``While the sales increase in our K mart discount stores was
fairly modest, we are encouraged by the results from two of our
strategic programs,'' Chairman Joseph E. Antonini said.
   He said the company has been placing great emphasis on lowering
shelf prices.
   ``In addition, our once-a-week advertising program is gaining
momentum and giving new dimension to our various merchandising
programs,'' Antonini said.
   In the first six months of its fiscal year, K mart's profit rose
8.7 percent _ to $283.6 million, or $1.41 a share, from $260.9
million, or $1.28 a share.
   First-half sales increased 5.3 percent, to $12.53 billion from
$11.90 billion a year earlier.
   K mart is the second-largest U.S. retailer after Sears, Roebuck
and Co., with sales of $25.6 billion in 1987. As of July 27, 1988,
it operated 2,233 K mart discount stores, 1,163 Waldenbooks stores,
122 Builders Square home-improvement outlets and 257 Pay Less Drug
stores.

Two weeks after CBS announced that it would be hooking up with K mart to 
promote its fall schedule, NBC said Tuesday it will be doing the same thing 
with Sears. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the CBS-K mart campaign will feature a viewer contest with more than 6 
million prizes, the NBC-Sears venture will offer grand-prize winners "instant 
stardom" by flying them to Hollywood to appear on NBC's prime-time programs and 
in promotional spots for the network. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion, announced at the annual NBC affiliates convention here by John 
Miller, senior vice president of NBC Entertainment, and Thomas E. Morris, vice 
president of marketing for Sears Merchandise Group, will run over a five-week 
period beginning Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Miller called the venture "the largest and most exciting promotion in network 
history." 
</P>
<P>
The grand-prize winner in each of four weekly contests beginning Sept. 3 will 
receive, along with a part on a prime-time program and transportation for two 
to Los Angeles, use of a limousine, a deluxe hotel suite, a "beauty makeover," 
shopping sprees, a luxury automobile and $10,000 in cash. Other prizes include 
cars, big-screen TVs, airline tickets, Sears gift certificates and NBC 
merchandise worth a total of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
To enter the contest, the entrant must answer simple questions about new NBC 
programs. Answers can be found in program descriptions that will appear in 
Sears advertising supplements beginning Labor Day. Entry blanks, available in 
the advertising supplements and at Sears stores, can be deposited in boxes at 
Sears stores. 
</P>
<P>
Sears will also include an eight-page color insert describing the new NBC shows 
in more than 20 million SearsCharge billing statements in September. 
Descriptions of NBC's fall lineup also will be inserted in the Sears fall 
catalogues, which wil be mailed to customers the week before the TV season 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
As K mart stores will be doing for CBS, Sears retail stores throughout the 
country will feature "NBC fall preview centers" decorated with mobiles, 
banners, posters and billboards, and will bombard shoppers with 
public-address-system announcements. A special "preview video" highlighting the 
contest and the new NBC shows will play on television sets in the stores. DIANE

   Ronald and Nancy Reagan mind their p's and
q's well enough to head this year's list of the nation's 10
best-mannered people, an etiquette specialist said Tuesday.
   ``People are aware of role models and they like beautifully
mannered people,'' said Marjabelle Stewart, author of 15 books,
including ``The New Etiquette.''
   Reagan appeared on her list for the fourth consecutive year.
   ``There is such a warmth about that man,'' said Mrs. Stewart.
``People say, `Isn't he wonderful under all this stress.'''
   Mrs. Reagan demonstrates ``real first-lady manners ... and
people have fallen in love with her,'' she said.
   Celebrites are judged on public and private behavior, said Mrs.
Stewart, who queries about 70 journalists, television-crew members,
make-up artists, chauffeurs and maitre d's who have frequent
contact with famous people.
   Also on the list are Sam M. Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores,
who is ``well-mannered but does not flaunt his wealth or act like a
big-shot,'' said Mrs. Stewart.
   Entertainer Dolly Parton, who has ``huggable manners and puts on
no airs,'' also made the list, she said.
   Others in the top 10: actor Jimmy Stewart; Ann Buchwald, wife of
columnist Art Buchwald; musician Lionel Richie; sports broadcaster
Frank Gifford; talk show host Johnny Carson; and Hugh Sidey,
Washington contributing editor for Time magazine.
   Only the Reagans also appeared on last year's list.

<HEAD>Retailers Post Moderate December Sales Gains</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Price cuts, an advertising blitz and special promotions helped
the nation's major retailers ring up moderate holiday sales gains.
   But the results reported Thursday by the nation's major
retailers confirmed that this past Christmas was a time of
conservative spending compared to Christmas 1988.
   General merchandise chains, department stores and discounters
posted December results that mostly met their expectations _ a
fairly unexciting holiday season.
   Walter Loeb of the investment firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
estimated that industrywide sales grew about 5 percent in December
compared with the same month a year earlier, down from a 7.5
percent`increase in December 1988.
   The performances differed depending on the type of retailer,
while various regional factors, such as the weather, also had an
impact. Store executives generally expressed satisfaction with
their results. But some retailers said they didn't get as much as
they had anticipated for Christmas.
   Retailers' sales are considered an indicator of total consumer
spending, which accounts for the bulk of the nation's economic
activity.
   The holidays are a crucial time for retailers because half or
more of their profits come from sales between Thanksgiving and
Christmas. Worried about softness in consumer spending, this past
year retailers poured on the promotions, many offering big
pre-Christmas bargains.
   ``If the retailer hadn't had the hook out he wouldn't have had
any customers in the stores,'' said Loeb, only half-jokingly.
   Still, he said, sales were a bit better than he had expected.
Unusually cold weather in parts of the country spurred purchases of
warm clothing and automotive products. Car batteries and snow tires
were mentioned as fast sellers by some general merchandise chains _
but the items weren't meant for under the Christmas tree.
   One of the most upbeat assessments came from Kenneth A. Macke,
chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton Hudson Corp., who
said solid gains at all divisions were ``more encouraging because
they came on top of a strong December'' in 1988. Dayton Hudson,
owner of department stores plus the Target discount chain, reported
an overall increase of 15.1 percent.
   Contrary to the industry trend, Macke said, Dayton Hudson was
slightly less promotional than the year before. Analysts said
Dayton Hudson probably had a more profitable season than many other
retailers that relied heavily on markdowns to attract customers.
   Price cutting is assumed to have taken a bite out of profits but
earnings won't suffer too much, thanks to tight inventory and other
cost controls as well as fairly low inflation, analysts said.
   Stores catering to clothing shoppers fared better than mass
merchants that have much of their business devoted to expensive
durable goods, such as stereos, televisions or home appliances.
   The large specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. reported an 11
percent gain in December sales. But not counting stores opened in
the past year, Limited's sales rose a more moderate 5 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts attach greater significance to
tallies that exclude newly opened stores. Results at stores open at
least a year, called comparable- or same-store sales, are
considered a better guide to a retailer's health.
   The biggest retailer in the country, Sears, Roebuck and Co., had
a mediocre showing but it probably wasn't any worse than the
company's internal forecasts. A low pricing policy adopted last
March to help Sears compete with faster growing discount rivals has
cut into Sears' results.
   Sears said its sales rose 3.6 percent in the five weeks ended
December 30 to $4.696 billion from $4.53 billion a year earlier.
But on a same-store basis Sears eked out only a 1.6 percent gain.
   Among other retailers reporting Thursday:
   K mart Corp., which ranks second behind Sears based on 1988
annual revenue, said its December sales rose 11.8 percent to $5.12
billion from $4.58 billion a year earlier. Its same-store sales
rose 3.1 percent.
   Fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the third largest U.S.
retailer, posted a 22 percent overall December sales gain, to $3.63
billion from the year-earlier's $2.97 billion, and an 8 percent
same-store sales increase.
   Among stores that predominantly sell apparel:
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its sales rose 9.7 percent to $2.72
billion from $2.48 billion in December 1988. Comparable-store sales
were up 8.6 percent.
   May Department Stores Co. said its sales rose 8.7 percent to
$1.80 billion from $1.65 billion and same-store sales were up 5.9
percent.
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. reported sales rose 3.5 percent
to $531.4 million from $513.4 million. The same-store gain was 3
percent.
   Philip M. Hawley, chairman and chief executive officer of the
West Coast retailer, said sales were slightly below the planned
amount due to unseasonable weather in parts of California and
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Retailers Ring Up Better-Than-Expected Sales During Christmas Rush</HEAD>

   Major retailers across the country went into the
Christmas season with lowered sales expectations, but many emerged
from it pleasantly surprised as consumers staged a buying burst.
   ``It was a good Christmas, a little bit better than what we had
planned,'' said Dayton Hudson Corp. spokesman Don St. Dennis.
   Wall Street analysts estimated overall retail sales were up
around 6 percent from Christmas 1987, with some segments of the
industry recording even stronger gains.
   Edward Johnson, an analyst with Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, estimated
that department stores, general merchandisers and discount chains
enjoyed a 25 percent to 30 percent increase.
   At the start of the season, Johnson estimated industry-wide sales
would rise about 5 percent to 6 percent, but the strong showing
prompted him to revise that figure to 6 percent to 7 percent.
   ``It's in the high range of what the stores have been looking
for,'' he said of the industry's performance.
   The Christmas season is crucial for retailers because they make
about half their annual profits during the period. Consumer activity
such as retail sales accounts for about two-thirds of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic activity.
   Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.,
said the general tone of business was better than last year, when
faltering sales forced retailers to slash their prices.
   But this season there were fewer markdowns, Greenstein said.
   At Dayton Hudson's department stores, there were just three
promotional events, the industry term for markdowns. That compared
with 10 last year, St. Dennis said.
   The department stores turned in a surprisingly strong
performance, he said.
   Some retailers said they came through the season well, even
though business was erratic.
   ``I don't think we expected it to be quite as see-saw as it
was,'' said Michael Wellman, vice president for marketing at K mart
Corp.
   Wellman said K mart had a robust start right after Thanksgiving,
but the retailer saw sales slacken and then pick up before surging
in the final days of the season.
   ``They came through again,'' he said of last-minute shoppers.
   Wellman estimated K mart's discount stores had a 6 percent sales
increase, what the company had hoped to achieve when the season
began. There were no runaway bestselling items, but ``it was a
pretty solid kind of sales performance,'' Wellman said.
   Another satisfied retailer was Tiffany &amp; Co., the luxury jeweler,
which reported its sales were up 24 percent from Nov. 1 through
Christmas Day. The company's performance indicated high-ticket gifts
sold well.
   The retailers and analysts had conservative expectations going
into the season because of a nearly 2-year-old retail sales slump.
Debt-saddled consumers have put many retail purchases on hold as
they pay for services and necessities.
   There were signs in recent months that sales might pick up, but
retailers were taking no chances. They stocked their shelves
carefully and didn't expect too much from the season.
   Retailers therefore have less merchandise to unload in the days
after Christmas.
   ``The stock rooms are clean _ there won't be a lot of big
clearance sales,'' Dayton Hudson's St. Dennis said.
   Some analysts said the holiday results might mean an end to that
the retailers' long dry spell is approaching.
   ``Christmas is really setting a positive tone for 1989,'' said
Robert Buchanan, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ``The consumer has been on his backside but is coming back.''
   ``Underlying strength in the consumer is beginning to build,''
Buchanan said. ``I'm looking for a respectable 1989 in terms of
non-durable sales.''
   But Greenstein, of Bear Stearns, was less optimistic. He said
clothing sales likely would be strong, but for the retail industry
as a whole, ``the rates of sales gains in recent months are not
sustainable.''

   K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the two giants of discount retailing, have plenty in common. 

   They carry much the same merchandise, offer prices that are pennies apart and operate stores that look almost exactly alike. 
Even their names are similar. 

   Yet consumer perceptions of the two chains are anything but the same. 
In several independent surveys, many shoppers say they view Wal-Mart as the industry leader, K mart as a laggard. 

   In a 1987 poll by the Chicago-based research firm Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates, Wal-Mart shoppers rated their store significantly higher and said they spent much more money than K mart shoppers said they did. 
Consumers questioned last year by Landor Associates, a strategic design consultant in San Francisco, gave much higher marks to Wal-Mart in the category of "esteem." 
And shoppers earlier this year told Mona Doyle, a consumer pollster in Philadelphia, that they were significantly more satisfied with Wal-Mart. 

   With so many similarities between the two chains, why do shoppers seem to view them so differently? 

   Some retailing specialists believe the answer lies in an often-ignored side of the industry. 
They say that unlike manufacturers, whose success depends more on the quality of their products, retailers can rise or fall on the tiny signals they send consumers in everything from the stores' logos to the width of their aisles. 

   It might not seem significant that Wal-Mart employees wear vests, while K mart employees don't, or that Wal-Mart bags its merchandise in brown paper sacks, while K mart uses plastic. 
But with other things roughly equal, these small differences can make a big difference in consumers' perceptions of what a retailer stands for and the vibes shoppers get in its stores, the specialists say. 

   "Everything a company does sends a signal about who they are, what they believe and what they want to be," says Carol Farmer, a retail consultant in Boca Raton, Fla. 
"One little bad thing can wipe out lots of good things." 

   K mart still is bigger than Wal-Mart in sales -- $27.3 billion to $20.6 billion in the latest fiscal year -- and number of stores -- 2,200 around the U.S., compared with 1,325 for Wal-Mart, mostly in the South and Midwest. 
But Wal-Mart edged ahead in profit for the first time in the fiscal year ended in January, with earnings of $837.2 million to K mart's $803 million. 
Wal-Mart's sales also have been growing much faster than K mart's in recent years. 

   Of course, in some areas -- such as advertising and quality of apparel sold -- consultants and some consumers give K mart higher marks than its rival. 
In recent years, K mart has overcome much of its disadvantage as an older chain through extensive renovation programs. 
It also has upgraded its customer service and cut prices. 
K mart says it is now Wal-Mart's equal. 
"Our research shows that in markets where we compete, Wal-Mart doesn't seem to have any competitive advantage," says Michael Wellman, K mart's marketing vice president. 
"The bulk of the people who have a choice shop both stores." 

   But many retailing executives and consultants consider Wal-Mart the leader in attention to the details that help shape shoppers' attitudes. 
They say the chain is particularly adept at striking the delicate balance needed to convince customers that its prices are low without making people feel that its stores are too cheap. 
These same consultants say K mart, on the other hand, sometimes risks cheapening its image with tactics that generate quick sales -- such as offering to double manufacturers' coupons or running its "blue light specials," the spur-of-the-moment sales that K mart stores announce over their public-address systems and mark with flashing blue lights. 

   The blue light special "has all the charm of a P.A. announcement in a railroad station," says Ted Peterson, a retail design consultant in Hinsdale, Ill. 
Although K mart says the specials spark heavy impulse buying, Mr. Peterson contends that the "net result is that it adds to the dreariness" of shopping at K mart. 

   Consultants also contrast Wal-Mart's simple logo, in white block letters on a brown background, with K mart's bright red and blue store signs. 
The brown in Wal-Mart's logo conveys "a warmer invitation" to shoppers, says Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive of Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc., an image consultant in New York. 
"It's friendlier and less blatantly commercial." 

   K mart's red "K" grabs shoppers' attention and signals that the store's prices will be low, consultants say. 
It also helps create a mood that can prompt impulse purchases. 
But several say the red K doesn't work particularly well with the cold turquoise blue letters that spell out the word "mart." 

   The K mart logo, though highly recognizable, also conveys the impression that the chain hasn't changed since its early discounting days in the 1960s. 
At the time, it attracted shoppers by hawking low-priced light bulbs, hangers and other odds and ends, not the more stylish apparel and home goods it also carries today. 
K mart says it has no immediate plans to change its logo, though that could happen at some point in the future. 

   Subtle differences in store decor also affect how shoppers feel. 
Visits to competing K mart and Wal-Mart outlets on the west side of Madison, Wis. -- both representative stores -- show how the little things can add up. 

   At the Wal-Mart, the main aisles are wider than those at the nearby K mart. 
Fluorescent lighting is recessed into the ceiling, creating a softer impression than the glare from the exposed strips at K mart. 
And the apparel departments are carpeted in a warm, autumnal orange, while K mart's are tiled in off-white. 

   Together, such features signal to consumers that Wal-Mart is "more upscale" and carries "a little better-quality" merchandise than K mart, says Jack D. Fontaine, a senior vice president at Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount-store unit. 

   Creating this impression is important in selling apparel, consultants say, because clothing shoppers linger longer and make more emotional choices than those in search of shampoo or household cleaners. 
Carpeting makes the department feel homier, and the padding underfoot can also make tired shoppers more comfortable. 

   Consultants who have studied the retailers say Wal-Mart has the edge in customer service, and that difference is also apparent in Madison. 
At the Wal-Mart store, an aggressively friendly grandfather guards the entrance, smiling at babies and striking up conversations with shoppers, while another employee follows customers to their cars to pick up their shopping carts and even stops to pet a puppy. 
At the nearby K mart, a young woman working as a greeter stands stoicaly and waits for people to ask her questions. 

   The Wal-Mart employees also wear blue vests that make them easier to pick out from a distance than K mart employees, identified only by small nameplates. 
And the vests' subdued blue color reinforces Wal-Mart's image as a friendly, nonthreatening place to shop. 

   All of which makes a difference with shoppers. 
Many consumers in focus groups held by Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates praised Wal-Mart for making them "feel more welcome," for taking "time out to treat you like they're glad you're doing business with them" or "smiling and saying, 'How are you doing?'" 

   Though consultants regard K mart's marketing efforts highly, they say the chain sometimes fails to state its message as clearly as Wal-Mart. 
Banners installed earlier this year by K mart include the vague claim that the chain has "Very Important Prices." 
"VIP" tags appear on its shelves. 
Wal-Mart's signs, by contrast, say "Always the Low Price on the Brands You Trust. 
Always." 

   Mr. Wellman, the K mart vice president, concedes that the VIP program "has not conveyed the message as succinctly as we wanted to. 
It's just another message that may or may not be here next year." 

   K mart also is trying to improve service, though Mr. Wellman says the efforts have nothing to do with Wal-Mart. 
K mart set up a toll-free phone line for customers to air their concerns. 
It started awarding prizes for customer service and distributed new employee badges that say "Committed to Customer Care." 
It also copied Wal-Mart's practice of stationing "people greeters" at its doors. 
Says Mr. Wellman: "We're going to have more to say on the subject" of service. 

   But what works for one chain doesn't necessarily work for the other. 
Wal-Mart, which has always had what it calls "everyday low prices," draws shoppers with only one ad circular a month. 
Last year, K mart cut back to one ad circular a week from two and started reducing prices to new "everyday levels." 
Nevertheless, in the first four months of its current fiscal year, K mart's customer count fell about 5% from a year earlier, says L. Wayne Hood, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

   With Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gaining like an
Arkansas rabbit on K mart Corp.'s position as the nation's
second-largest retailer, K mart has decided it's time for a
makeover.
   K mart has been revamping old stores, opening new ones and
trying to update its ``blue light special'' image under a
five-year, $2.3 billion chainwide makeover aimed at fending off
expanding competitors.
   Faced with newer stores by such expanding chains as Wal-Mart,
from Bentonville, Ark., and Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp.'s
Target discount chain, K mart has been trying to rouse customers
with a brighter, higher-intensity atmosphere, expanded product
offerings and new services.
   The stores are moving their usual popcorn and tobacco counters
away from front-and-center, shedding dull linoleum and cluttered
aisles and offering such new products as fax machines to attract
customers.
   ``Retail is energy: their saliva glands are going, their credit
cards are hot,'' said Michael Crosson, an outside designer hired to
help shape the chain's future.
   This isn't goodbye to blue-collar customers who have flocked to
decades of K mart ``blue light specials'' and ``midnight madness''
sales. Those will continue, K mart spokesman Orren F. Knauer said.
   But in a departure from its past, K mart has been stocking more
brand-name merchandise to appeal to customers, and those household
names will be better displayed in the new stores, Chairman Joseph
E. Antonini said this week.
   Events of the past week showed the task K mart faces in trying
to perk itself up.
   Antonini said on Monday that K mart would take a $640 million
charge against its 1989 earnings to pay for speeding up its
five-year, $2.3 billion chainwide makeover.
   As a result, K mart is expected to report only minimal or flat
earnings next week. It reported 1988 profits of $802.9 million on
sales of $27.3 billion.
   Meanwhile, smaller but faster-growing 1,400-store Wal-Mart
announced record sales and profits for 1989, with earnings up 28.5
percent to $1.1 billion on sales of $25 billion. Wal-Mart on
Thursday reported its sales February sales were up 33 percent,
while at its stores open a year or longer sales were up 17 percent.
   ``It's not if, it's when Wal-Mart will pass them by at their
present growth rates,'' said Frederick Marx, an independent
retailing consultant based in Bloomfield Hills.
   But Marx predicted a shifting lead, with K mart never far
behind. Wal-Mart, though growing fast in small-town America, won't
be able match K mart's immense array of store sites in metropolitan
areas, he said.
   Fighting back will mean changes at almost all of K mart's more
than 2,300 discount stores, Antonini said. He announced plans to
build 250 new stores, enlarge 620, relocate 280, close 30 and
refurbish about 1,260 in the five-year program.
   Prototypes already are operating in the Detroit suburbs of Royal
Oak and Rochester, Mich., and Virginia Beach, Va.
   Both new and old stores have adopted folksy Wal-Mart style
``people-greeters.'' At K-mart's old-style store in Port Huron, on
Lake Huron 60 miles north of Detroit, a greeter with a rag grinned
recently as he wiped melted snow from carts just in from the
parking lot and pushed them toward incoming shoppers.
   In the new store, instead of a whiff of the popcorn, candy and
tobacco counter of old, shoppers are greeted by gleaming floors,
bright lights and wide-open spaces.
   The popcorn counter was moved to a cafeteria area right of the
entrance. Rest rooms are easy to find, stylish graphics mark the
cosmetics area, videos play among the sporting goods and the stores
have bold signs and bigger stocks of merchandise on the shelves.
   ``Look at the jewelry area,'' Knauer said. ``It's the same
product we sell in the other stores, but the fixturing is more
department-store like. It makes the product look better.''
   Crosson, executive vice president of Jon Greenberg and
Associates Inc. in Berkley, said such perceptions amounted to
reality, in retailing.
   ``It's no longer just a bigger dime store, it's a discount
department store,'' he said of K mart.
   Crosson's firm has designed stores for retail establishments
including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and chains owned by New York-based
Mercantile Stores, which include Cincinnati's McAlpin's, Denver's
Joslin's and Florida's Gayfer's department stores.

   With Christmas sales still lagging going into
the final weekend of the season, some retailers are intensifying
efforts to hook last-minute shoppers by increasing markdowns and
putting more merchandise on sale.
   But analysts said even an eleventh-hour consumer spending spree
- which most retailers are hoping for - won't be enough to turn the
season around.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said
Thursday it was expanding markdowns to include more merchandise
lines and stepping up advertising in hopes of attracting more
buyers.
   ``We are adjusting to the conditions,'' said Matthew Howard,
Sears' senior vice president for marketing, who described his
company's Christmas sales as ``slightly below expectations.''
   Sears, which two weeks ago moved up price reductions on winter
apparel lines, added new markdowns on merchandise including
exercise equipment, home lighting and electric blankets, Howard
said in a phone interview.
   The retailer was also moving up its annual furniture clearance
sale, which traditionally does not begin till after Christmas, he
said. It decided to extend a no-interest financing incentive for
major appliance buyers through Jan. 1.
   ``We felt all along that this weekend would be the one that's
most critical,'' Howard said.
   Sales have been at best sluggish for many stores. Burdened by
worries about their jobs, the economy and the Middle East crisis,
consumers have been spending cautiously and warmer weather has
stalled sales of heavy clothing and other winter merchandise.
   Retailers and analysts reported consumers were generally
shunning expensive gifts for cheaper and more practical items.
Walter Loeb, a retail analyst and consultant, said he has found
retailers are selling more smaller items, such as accessories and
cosmetics, this year.
   Across the country, retailers have had ``sale'' signs up for
weeks in an attempt to lure shoppers. Like Sears, they've increased
discounts as the days have gone by, and in the last days of the
season, some of the price cuts will be heavier.
   ``Starting last weekend, stores did push the panic button and
they're pushing harder to get sales,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, a
retail industry analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc.
   ``It's not working all that well - that's the scary part of
it,'' he said.
   However, Howard said Sears' earlier markdowns did produce
``significant, favorable'' results.
   At J.C. Penney Co. Inc., customers this weekend will see
markdowns of 50 percent on some items, spokesman Duncan Muir said.
   Penney's sales through last weekend ran about even with last
year, a disappointing performance, Muir said.
   ``With what we bought for Christmas, we can't be happy,'' Muir
said, referring to the merchandise Penney hasn't been able to move.
``On the other hand, we realize we're in a recessionary environment
and it's a difficult period.''
   One bright spot for Penney was a pickup in catalog sales, aided
by special promotions such as $15 off on a purchase of $75.
   ``We've got our fingers crossed'' going into the last weekend,
Muir said.
   But Loeb said that while ``a last-minute rush is now developing,
I still don't see the enthusiasm, the momentum that would make up
for a lot of this lost time.''
   Loeb predicted that when Christmas is over, the retail
industry's overall sales will be down 3 percent from last year.
After inflation is subtracted, the decline will be even sharper.
   Some retailers, who were satisfied with their sales earlier in
the season, seem to have lost some optimism.
   ``It's certainly difficult and we're looking forward to the
weekend ...'' said Ann Barkelew, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson
Corp. ``The concern always is, `Will we have enough people.'''
   In the first few weeks of the season, Dayton Hudson had said it
was pleased with its results.
   Through last week, Dayton Hudson's overall sales were about the
same as a year earlier, Ms. Barkelew said. Strong business at the
company's Target discount stores and Mervyn's apparel chain was
offset by poor sales at its Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's
department stores.
   Kmart Corp.'s vice president for marketing, Michael Wellman said
of this Christmas, ``It's a season that could be better.''
   However, he said, ``It's not over yet - I'm not pessimistic by
any stretch of the imagination.''
   Kmart has increased advertising during the last week before
Christmas, but ``that was all planned'' in advance, Wellman said.
