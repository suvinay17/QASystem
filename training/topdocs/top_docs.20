RUBIN LAUGHED ALL THE WAY TO BANK, HALL OF FAME;
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Rubin, who wisecracked his way through the career of John Henry, a horse
who earned $6.5 million after Rubin bought him for $25,000, hasn't retired as a
stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
On an occasion that sometimes is solemn and tearful, Rubin and Dick Francis,
the former British steeplechase jockey who became a best-selling mystery
novelist, made levity the pattern of the day Thursday as four horses, two
trainers and a jockey were admitted into racing's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
The induction ceremony, held under a large tent next to the Hall of Fame and
across the street from the Saratoga track, was attended by more than 1,000
people, among them 34 enshrined trainers and jockeys invited back for the
hall's 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Francis, who lives in Florida and was visiting Saratoga for the first time,
told jokes. Later, after John Forsythe presented John Henry's plaque to Rubin,
the horse's owner laughed at himself for his lack of racing expertise both
before and after he bought the horse.
</P>
<P>
Also inducted were Ron McAnally, who has trained John Henry and about 90 other
stakes-winning horses; Jonathan Sheppard, America's premier steeplechase
trainer; and jockey Jorge Velasquez, who is still riding after winning more
than 6,000 races.
</P>
<P>
Besides John Henry, other horses inducted were All Along, the brilliant grass
filly from France who won horse-of-the-year honors in the United States in
1983; Bimelech, winner of the Preakness and Belmont Stakes in 1940; and Zaccio,
the champion steeplechase horse in 1980-82.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 75, is a New York bicycle importer and lifelong horseplayer who owned
only a few insignificant horses until John Henry, a mean-spirited gelding who
had already gone through seven owners, came along in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Rubin recalled Thursday how he told his wife, Dorothy, that he was going to
spend about $50,000 on a couple of so-so horses and have some fun. Rubin was
quickly put in touch with Harold Snowden, the owner of John Henry, through a
bloodstock agent.
</P>
<P>
"I gave 10% of the sale price to the agent," Rubin said. "I didn't know that I
wasn't supposed to pay the commission."
</P>
<P>
John Henry was sent from Kentucky to New York for a physical inspection before
the sale could be completed.
</P>
<P>
" 'This horse is in at the knees (knock-kneed),' " Rubin said he was told by
veterinarian Manny Gilman.
</P>
<P>
" 'That's good,' " Rubin said he naively replied.
</P>
<P>
Rubin first sent John Henry to trainer Bobby Donato, who looked at the horse
and said to the owner: "This horse has a grass foot."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he didn't know what that meant, either.
</P>
<P>
"I looked down at the ground and didn't see any grass," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The term refers to feet that are smaller than usual, which indicate that a
horse will run well on turf.
</P>
<P>
John Henry won seven Eclipse Awards, including four grass championships, and
was voted horse of the year in 1981 and 1984, the second time as a 9-year-old.
Now 15, John Henry is stabled at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, where
the public can visit him.
</P>
<P>
McAnally thanked the late Maxwell Gluck, the owner of Elmendorf Farm, for being
responsible for the trainer's getting John Henry when Rubin transferred the
horse to California in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"When you're young, you have many dreams, both night and day," McAnally said.
"One of my dreams was to have a horse of this caliber. I'll be with him
forever, and as long as he's around, I'll be around."
</P>
<P>
McAnally, his mother dead and his father unable to support a large family,
lived in a Kentucky orphanage for several years before he was introduced to
racing's backstretch by his uncle, Reggie Cornell.
</P>
<P>
An Englishman, Sheppard bought a one-way ticket on a cargo ship to the United
States in 1961.
</P>
<P>
"I was 21, and I sold my second-hand car and my second-hand horse," Sheppard
said. "All I had when I got off the boat was $100 in my pocket and the
addresses of some distant cousins in Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
Sheppard thanked Burley Cocks for getting him started in the United States.
Cocks, one of the Hall of Fame members present Thursday, trained Zaccio.
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, dressed in a gray morning coat, accepted his plaque from Eddie
Arcaro, a jockey who was inducted in 1958.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy, and a little nervous," Velasquez said. "But the day has
arrived and I'm tickled to death. I'm very glad to belong to this very special
group of champions. I thank God that He gave me this special life."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, last year's champion 3-year-old filly, makes her first start today
since winning the Breeders' Cup Distaff last November. She won't be favored,
however, in Saratoga's Ballerina, because the field includes Stormy But Valid,
the California shipper who has won three stakes at Santa Anita and Hollywood
Park this year. . . . Angel Cordero, who rode Open Mind to eight victories and
two thirds in 11 starts last year, took a call on Stormy But Valid when he
thought Open Mind wouldn't be running today. Gary Stevens has the mount on Open
Mind.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the two best 3-year-old fillies in the country, Go for Wand and
Charon, will run at Saratoga in the Alabama. . . . Steinlen is set to run
Sunday in the Bernard Baruch Handicap.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Longden, inducted into the Hall of Fame as a jockey in 1958, called the
hall last week, canceling his appearance at the ceremonies. Ralph Neves was
another absent jockey. Among the trainers missing were Woody Stephens and Bill
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
Cordero, leading jockey at Saratoga for 13 of the last 14 years, received a
court stay on a 10-day suspension and his case won't be reviewed until the end
of the year. . . . Jose Santos, the jockey who broke Cordero's Saratoga streak
in 1987, didn't contest a five-day suspension and began the meeting on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
The factions in the expected proxy fight at Hollywood Park over the status of
track president Marje Everett estimate that legal fees will cost each side $2
million. Everett's fees would come from track coffers and the opposition's
costs would have to be privately paid. . . . Bob Strub, chief executive officer
at Santa Anita, said it is still possible that the track will get the Breeders'
Cup in 1992, but negotiations have hit several snags. One point of disagreement
is how much Santa Anita must charge its season-ticket holders. Strub feels that
the prices suggested by the Breeders' Cup are considerably higher than they
should be.

IT WAS A DIFFERENCE OF STYLES IN THE PREAKNESS;
</P>
<P>
VALENZUELA'S AGGRESSIVE WESTERN RIDING OVERWHELMED DAY'S EASTERN PATIENCE

<P>
A few years ago, near the end of his riding career, Don Pierce talked about the
difference between riding horses in California and in the East.
</P>
<P>
"In California, there is a completely different style of riding," said Pierce,
who rode more than 180 stakes winners at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park before
he turned to training. "Out here (California), the tendency is to ride tight.
There's usually not a whole lot of room between horses.
</P>
<P>
"I used to ride back East, when there wasn't year-round racing in California,
and you could tell the difference. Back there, the style is to spread the
horses out, with everybody giving everybody else a lot of room. You could drive
a truck between horses in many of the Eastern races, compared to the tight
quarters we're used to in California."
</P>
<P>
Some Easterners do not like the aggressive Western style. They see tight riding
as rough riding. When his Alydar won the 1978 Travers because of a foul by
Affirmed and California jockey Laffit Pincay, trainer John Veitch said: "I
expected Affirmed's number to come down. Pincay was using that bareback stuff
that they get away with in California, but it doesn't cut it in New York."
</P>
<P>
Similar tactics by Pat Valenzuela two weeks ago at Pimlico won the Preakness
for Sunday Silence and kept the 3-year-old colt eligible for a Triple Crown
sweep when the 121st Belmont Stakes is run here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who had already won the Kentucky Derby, took the Preakness by
the bob of a nose over Easy Goer, in what was a classic example of the
hell-for-leather style against the patient, more relaxed Eastern manner.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's superb performance in the Preakness was not unlike some other
memorable rides by West Coast jockeys in recent Triple Crown races. In the 1983
Belmont, Pincay might have been the country's only rider who would have tried
to squeeze Caveat through a small hole on the rail at the top of the stretch.
</P>
<P>
Caveat bounced off the rail not once but twice, but the move was instrumental
in the colt's three-and-one-half-length victory.
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 Kentucky Derby, it was Bill Shoemaker, with a Derring-Do hardly
characteristic of his brilliant career, who sent Ferdinand through a
rapidly-closing hole at the top of the stretch, and the rest was easy. Had
Rampage been just slightly quicker and been able to reach the same hole, his
jockey, Pat Day, said that they would have won the Derby.
</P>
<P>
If Shoemaker stole a page from Pincay in winning the '86 Derby, Valenzuela did
another pretty good imitation in this year's Preakness.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence may be a better horse than Easy Goer, anyway. He was 2 1/2
lengths better in the mud at Churchill Downs, and though the issue was in doubt
until the last stride of the Preakness, Sunday Silence nevertheless showed the
kind of championship gameness that was the calling card of Affirmed when he
edged out Alydar all three times in 1978 to become the last Triple Crown
winner.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the abilities of the horses, the Preakness was still a jockeys'
race, and horseplayers forever will be saying that the outcome turned on
Valenzuela outriding Day, the more experienced Eastern jockey.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela made two moves to help him win; Day made three mistakes that might
have cost him the victory.
</P>
<P>
Day, who later suggested that he erred, prematurely moved Easy Goer to the
front on the far turn. Valenzuela, along with just about everybody else
watching the race, was surprised that Easy Goer would go when he did, but he
didn't panic.
</P>
<P>
"I saw Easy Goer go by me so quick," Valenzuela said. "But I knew I had plenty
of horse and just waited. He stopped us a little (by forcing Sunday Silence
dangerously close to the heels of Houston, who had been on the lead), but I had
plenty of horse and then I moved up outside of him (Easy Goer)."
</P>
<P>
That was move No. 2 by Valenzuela, boxing Easy Goer into the rail, which is the
worst place to be in a knock-down-drag-out stretch duel.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela told friends he had Easy Goer where he wanted him.
</P>
<P>
Besides moving too soon, Day also allowed Valenzuela to outmaneuver him for the
stretch drive. Before the Kentucky Derby, Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence's
trainer, was caught defending his choice of Valenzuela as the colt's jockey.
Several California jockeys with bigger names were available and Valenzuela had
had an erratic spring in riding some of Whittingham's other stakes horses.
</P>
<P>
But Wittingham kept saying Valenzuela was an excellent position rider. In the
Preakness, that proved to be true.
</P>
<P>
Day's last mistake was made in the final yards when he jerked Easy Goer's head
in the direction of Sunday Silence. Before Day's explanation, it appeared that
Easy Goer might have even been trying to bite Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
Day said that he cocked Easy Goer's head at a 45-degree angle because he wanted
his mount to see Sunday Silence just outside him. But this was wasted motion in
a race that was decided by inches. Easy Goer and Sunday Silence were so close
that they were brushing. Even without having his head cocked, Easy Goer would
have had to be blind not to notice his rival.
</P>
<P>
For a while, though, it still looked as if the Preakness might be a repeat of
one of Day's most exceptional rides -- in the first Breeders' Cup Classic, at
Hollywood Park in 1984. That afternoon, Day was trapped on the rail by two
horses, one of them the undisciplined, Lugging-In Gate Dancer on the far
outside. But Day persevered, and got Wild Again home in a three-way photo
finish.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Belmont could be another jockeys' race, with the pressure on Day.
Sunday Silence figures to be ahead of Easy Goer in the early going, and Day
can't let Valenzuela's colt get too far ahead. Day also must decide when to
move on Sunday Silence, and hope that his decision isn't as ill-timed as it was
at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
Both horses are bred to run 1 1/2 miles, so the jockeys, as they were in the
Preakness, are likely to be the tell-tale ingredient.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see any way Easy Goer can beat us in the Belmont," Valenzuela
said.
</P>
<P>
There is a way, of course, because Easy Goer is a good horse behind another
good horse in a light year for 3-year-olds, and even a colt as talented as
Sunday Silence is not invincible. But because of what has happened in this
brief, two-race rivalry, the younger rider from the West is suddenly looming
larger than the more heralded jockey from the East.

NOW SUNDAY SILENCE HAS THEM TALKING;
</P>
<P>
AFTER PREAKNESS WIN, HORSE SETS SIGHTS ON BELMONT AND TRIPLE CROWN

<P>
Easy Goer was transported 200 miles from Pimlico to Belmont Park on Sunday,
which means that he beat Sunday Silence to the site of the final Triple Crown
race by a day.
</P>
<P>
It's the only time Easy Goer has beaten Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
Although heavily favored in two previous Triple Crown races, Easy Goer finished
second to Sunday Silence each time. He was 2 1/2 lengths behind in the Kentucky
Derby, and on Saturday at Pimlico, he was nosed out of a victory in what may go
down as the most rousing Preakness of them all.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer will meet again in the 121st Belmont Stakes on
June 10. Sunday Silence can become the 12th 3-year-old -- and the first since
another California-trained colt, Affirmed, in 1978 -- to sweep the Triple
Crown. Because of a sponsorship by an automobile company, a Triple Crown title
is worth $5 million, which includes the first-place purse money from all three
races. Should Sunday Silence not win the Belmont but finish second or third, he
would still win a $1-million bonus; Easy Goer could win the $1 million by
winning the Belmont and if Sunday Silence finishes fourth or worse.
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, trainer of Hawkster, a horse who has been unable to beat Sunday
Silence in the Santa Anita Derby, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, doesn't
need the Belmont to know which horse is best. Hawkster has been fourth, fifth
and fifth in those three races.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Silence missed two days of training (because of a sore foot) and still
won the Preakness," McAnally said. "There's no question that he's the best
horse. Because of that, he was about two lengths rather than a nose better than
Easy Goer on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's trainer, Shug McGaughey, thought that his colt's dull race in the
Kentucky Derby was because of the muddy track at Churchill Downs. But there
were no excuses in the 114th Preakness, unless you count the foul claim by
jockey Pat Day, who thought that Sunday Silence squeezed his mount enough in
the furious stretch run to be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer fouled Patrick (Valenzuela, Sunday Silence's jockey) a heck of a lot
more than he was fouled by us," trainer Charlie Whittingham said Sunday
morning. "The other horse had his head turned in my horse's direction and Day
was whipping him left-handed on the rail, which made his horse come out some."
</P>
<P>
The stewards took eight minutes -- a little longer than usual -- to review the
race before they officiated Sunday Silence's victory.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said Sunday Silence will be shipped to Belmont Park today and be
placed in trainer Dick Lundy's barn. Lundy worked as an assistant to
Whittingham in California for six years before he formed his own stable.
</P>
<P>
At 1 1/2 miles, the Belmont is the longest of the three Triple Crown races. The
Derby is 1 1/4 miles and the Preakness is 1 3/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
Neither Whittingham nor Day believe their horses will have trouble running the
Belmont distance. Although Belmont Park issued a list of eight non-Preakness
horses that are possibilities for the race, it remains to be seen how many will
actually run.
</P>
<P>
"Even though we missed two days last week because of the foot, I wasn't worried
that Sunday Silence would be fit for the Preakness," Whittingham said. "He was
plenty fit for the Derby two weeks before and had that under him. On Saturday,
he was ready to run half-way to California without using the freeway."
</P>
<P>
McGaughey thought that Day moved to the lead too early -- Easy Goer took over
heading into the far turn -- but said that no jockey change is planned for the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with what Pat said," McGaughey said. "If he didn't move early, he
would have been parked outside the rest of the way. And if he had waited and we
still lost by a nose, everybody would have said that he moved too late."
</P>
<P>
Pimlico's record crowd of 90,145 made Easy Goer the 3-5 favorite and sent
Sunday Silence off at 2-1. In the Kentucky Derby, Sunday Silence was 3-1 and
Easy Goer, coupled with stablemate Awe Inspiring, was 4-5.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's betting didn't surprise Whittingham, but it did amuse him.
</P>
<P>
"These guys (Easy Goer's supporters) don't die very easy," he said. "It's the
press that makes the odds, and sometimes they get people thinking poorly."
</P>
<P>
In talking about Sunday Silence's second career defeat, which preceded his
current five-race winning streak, Whittingham mentioned Houston, the horse that
beat him in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance at Hollywood Park last December. This
year, Houston has finished fifth in the Santa Anita Derby, eighth in the
Kentucky Derby and sixth in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
"Houston got good press early," Whittingham said. "But the race he beat us at
Hollywood still told me that I had a very good horse. My horse had just broken
his maiden a couple of weeks before, and against Houston he put away three
horses early before they hooked up in the stretch."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who lost to Houston by a head, has developed into possibly the
best horse Whittingham, 76, has ever had. Whittingham has won more than 500
stakes races, which is a record, and has trained eight horses that have won
national championships.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Sunday Silence could be the best," Whittingham said. "For sure,
he's the only one who's given me both a Derby and a Preakness."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham won his first Derby in 1986 with Ferdinand. Their Triple Crown
aspirations ended quickly, however, when Ferdinand was second, four lengths
behind Snow Chief, in the Preakness, and then Ferdinand ran third in the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
Now, Whittingham and Sunday Silence are only 1 1/2 miles away. Easy Goer has
the early lead, but only because he shipped out of here Sunday.

The jockeys of the two top horses in Saturday's Kentucky Derby are a study in
contrasts, both on and off the track.
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, the easy rider, will be aboard Easy Goer, the chocolate-colored
powerhouse from the East and the overwhelming Derby favorite. Pat Valenzuela,
the turmoil kid, has the assignment on Sunday Silence, the sleek black
challenger from California and the 3-year-old given the best chance to crash
Easy Goer's Triple Crown party.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the Pats has won the Derby, but one or the other is almost certain
to change that Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, winner of the Wood Memorial this year and last year's champion
2-year-old colt, has been beating up on horses in Florida and New York since
the year began. Sunday Silence, who has been facing a better group of horses
out West, is, like Easy Goer, undefeated in three races as a 3-year-old and
comes to Churchill Downs off an epic 11-length victory in the Santa Anita
Derby.
</P>
<P>
The day Sunday Silence won at Santa Anita, Valenzuela hit him with his whip at
least 10 times through the stretch, even though the colt had established a
clear lead coming out of the turn and no horses were challenging.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Day didn't use his whip at all two weeks later in the Wood,
although it appeared that Easy Goer might need some urging before he went on to
a three-length victory.
</P>
<P>
There's proof here that a jockey can't please all of the people all of the
time.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock, Sunday Silence's principal owner, didn't like to see Valenzuela
flailing away in the Santa Anita Derby, and neither did the colt's trainer,
Charlie Whittingham.
</P>
<P>
And although Day's ride in the Wood was typical of his aplomb under pressure,
it is a style that infuriates New York horseplayers, accustomed to seeing more
aggressive tactics from the likes of Angel Cordero, who might start hustling a
horse at the three-eighths pole.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela explained to Sunday Silence's handlers that he wanted to make sure
the horse got enough out of the Santa Anita race to have him ready for the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham seldom emphasizes the jockey's role in the winning of a race. After
the Santa Anita Derby, the trainer said:
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever said that these jockeys ever came with a lot of brains. But Pat is
a good rider and that's why we have him. He's got the reputation as a gate
rider (breaking a horse quickly), but he's got more than that going for him.
He's an excellent position rider, getting the horse in the spot he needs to be,
and that should help in the big field that we have in the Derby."
</P>
<P>
Day might not have whipped Easy Goer in the Wood because the only other time he
used the stick on the horse -- and he has ridden him in all nine starts --
there was a negative reaction. That was in Easy Goer's last loss, his
second-place finish to Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile over a muddy
track at Churchill Downs last November.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, I probably shouldn't have even hit him in the Breeders' Cup,"
Day said. "I did it out of desperation, and I think he got annoyed with me,
because he knew he was doing the best he could on a track that was like peanut
butter. So he jumped the tire tracks from the starting gate and changed leads
(switched from one lead foot to the other), and I didn't hit him anymore."
</P>
<P>
Day provided the classic example of his forsaking the whip in the Breeders' Cup
Classic, racing's first $3-million race, at Hollywood Park in 1984. Day didn't
hit Wild Again once, even though they were locked in a furious three-horse
drive with Slew o' Gold and Gate Dancer. Wild Again won by a head.
</P>
<P>
Day is 35 and Valenzuela is 26. Each has won his share of major races; Day has
won three other Breeders' Cup stakes and Valenzuela, only a week after his
apprenticeship ended, won the Santa Anita Derby with Codex in 1980. However,
Day is winless in six Kentucky Derbies and Valenzuela has failed to win in two
tries here.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela might have had a couple of other good shots at Churchill Downs, but
once the horse didn't run and the other time the jockey couldn't be here.
Trainer Wayne Lukas neglected to nominate Codex, and after Valenzuela won the
Arkansas Derby with the filly, Althea, in 1984, he suffered a broken clavicle
in a spill at Hollywood Park and missed the race.
</P>
<P>
Things seem to happen to Valenzuela, who broke a leg in another spill and
suffered a broken hand in a Hollywood Park jockeys' room fight with Gary
Stevens. He has also been in and out of drug and alcohol rehabilitation at
least three times and in trouble with stewards in California and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Day can relate to Valenzuela's troubled career. In the mid-1970s, the
small-town jockey from Colorado was trying to carve out a living in New York.
Day fought with jockeys, went through drug and alcohol problems and eventually
it cost his marriage.
</P>
<P>
Now, he is kind of considered an evangelist on horseback. He is likely as not
to answer a question with a quotation from the Bible, and he thanks God --
before the owner and trainer of the horse -- if he wins an important race.
</P>
<P>
"I know Pat (Valenzuela) has gone through rehab, and that's necessary when you
have a problem," Day said.
</P>
<P>
While Day openly discusses his personal problems, Valenzuela politely maintains
his privacy and has continued to avoid answering questions about his past drug
use since he arrived at Churchill Downs on Wednesday.

TWO WILL CHALLENGE SUNDAY SILENCE

<P>
Tom Tatham stopped by trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn at Hollywood Park to
see the new, improved Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
Tatham would rather be racing the 4-year-colt than rooting for him, but at
least he has the satisfaction of having bred last year's horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
Pam Mabes, Sunday Silence's exercise rider, took Tatham and a friend over to
the stall of the near-black colt. Those who remember Sunday Silence from last
year are taken aback when they see him now.
</P>
<P>
"He is awesome looking," said Arthur Hancock, who after taking Sunday Silence
from Tatham kept the young horse when buyers wouldn't bid more than $32,000 for
him at two auctions.
</P>
<P>
February was the first time Hancock had seen Sunday Silence since his victory
over Easy Goer in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in November.
</P>
<P>
"The change in his appearance was unbelievable," Hancock said. "He's gained
about 100 pounds, and he's so much broader and stronger. He's now a
powerful-looking horse, similar to the way Easy Goer looks."
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer might have won the beauty contests last year, but it was Sunday
Silence who won most of the races. Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer in both the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness before losing to him in the Belmont, then
clinched horse-of-the-year honors by outrunning Easy Goer for the third time
and winning the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Arlington International will put up a $1-million purse Aug. 4 if both Sunday
Silence and Easy Goer race. Last Saturday, Easy Goer ran third, behind Criminal
Type and Housebuster, in the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery for the removal of two
bone chips 12 days after the Breeders' Cup, will make his first appearance this
year Sunday, in the $300,000 Californian at 1 1/8 miles. Because of Sunday
Silence, the race has drawn only three starters.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's opponents -- Charlatan III and Stylish Winner -- have won one
race in 26 starts in the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
"My horse has four legs, just like (Sunday Silence)," said Hector Palma, who
trains the Chilean-bred Charlatan III. "Look at what happened to Easy Goer, he
got beat. People might be saying I'm crazy, but things happen. My horse is
improving, and should run a good race, and the other horse is coming back from
a layoff."
</P>
<P>
Charlatan III, who will be ridden by Julio Garcia, will carry 111 pounds, 15
less than Sunday Silence, whose jockey will be Chris McCarron. Stylish Winner,
with Corey Black aboard, will carry 115 pounds under race conditions that
determine weight by money won.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence has eight victories and four second-place finishes in 12 starts,
with earnings of $4.5 million. He has lost twice at Hollywood Park, in an
allowance race against Houston as a 2-year-old and against Prized in last
year's Swaps Stakes.
</P>
<P>
"He should be just as good as he was," said McCarron, who has been riding
Sunday Silence in his recent workouts. "He's coming along beautifully. He's
filled out and he's put on some muscle."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham's plans are for Sunday Silence to run in the $1-million Hollywood
Gold Cup on June 24, then the Arlington race and finally a fall campaign that
would set him up for another try in the Breeders' Cup, which this year will be
at Easy Goer's home track, Belmont Park, Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
There has been a change in ownership since Sunday Silence last ran, Japanese
breeder Zenya Yoshida having joined the colt's original partners, Hancock,
Whittingham and Ernest Gaillard, a retired surgeon from La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
In March, after unsuccessfully trying to buy Sunday Silence outright, Yoshida
bought 25% of the colt for a reported $2.25 million. Hancock now owns 37.5%,
Gaillard has 20% and Whittingham owns 17.5%. Whittingham will continue to
manage Sunday Silence's racing career and Hancock will take over once the horse
is retired to stud, probably next year.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
There will be only win and $2 exacta betting on the Californian, which has been
won by Charlie Whittingham 10 times, most recently with Judge Angelucci in
1987. . . . In Charlatan III's last start, he went off at 35-1 and lost by a
head to Super May in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap. . . . Stylish Winner was fifth
in the race.
</P>
<P>
Owner Bob Levy, a visitor at Hollywood Park Friday morning, said that
Housebuster would be given two months of rest after his second-place finish
against Criminal Type in the Metropolitan Handicap. Housebuster's next start is
scheduled to be the seven-furlong King's Bishop at Saratoga Aug. 18, followed
by the Vosburgh at Belmont Park Sept. 29 and the Breeders' Cup Sprint Oct. 27.
"The horse has had a tremendous amount of racing," Levy said. "Sometimes he
wins easy, but he still runs very fast and that takes something out of a
horse."
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally will send Silver Ending, fifth in the Kentucky Derby
Derby, to Canterbury Downs for the $300,000 St. Paul Derby June 23. McAnally
plans to run Bayakoa at Hollywood June 16 in the Milady Handicap, a race the
mare won last year. "We're still thinking about trying Silver Ending on the
grass," McAnally said. "But the Canterbury race looks like one he'll have a
good chance to win." McAnally has no race in mind for Hawkster after his
second-place finish in the Hollywood Turf Handicap.

EASY GOER MIGHT MAKE HAY WHILE SUN SHINES;
</P>
<P>
IF SUNDAY SILENCE TAKES SUMMER OFF, BELMONT CHAMPION COULD WIN DIVISION

<P>
Thanks to that $1-million bonus he clinched by running second in Saturday's
Belmont Stakes, Sunday Silence has earned about $700,000 more than Easy Goer.
</P>
<P>
But Easy Goer, the toast of New York after he atoned for his Kentucky Derby and
Preakness sins with a smashing victory in the Belmont, could catch up quickly
if he doesn't have to hook up with Sunday Silence soon.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer will continue to run in the East while Sunday Silence returns to
trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn at Hollywood Park for a rest. With Easy Goer
and Sunday Silence dominating the 3-year-old division, both will be heavy
favorites wherever they run, as long as they're not in the same race.
</P>
<P>
Other than the Big Two, only Hawkster ran in all of the Triple Crown races, and
his handlers should be considering other options after what is believed to be
an unprecedented three consecutive fifth-place finishes. Hawkster was beaten by
a total of 35 1/2 lengths in the Derby, Preakness and Belmont.
</P>
<P>
The only fresh horse to run against Easy Goer and Sunday Silence in the Belmont
was Le Voyageur, a French-raced son of Seattle Slew who ran one of the fastest
opening miles in stakes history, then hung on to finish third, a length behind
Sunday Silence. Le Voyageur is headed back to France and probably won't race in
the United States until the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park in November.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, whose colt beat Easy Goer by 2 1/2 lengths in the Derby and by a
nose in the Preakness before losing the $5-million Triple Crown by eight
lengths in the Belmont, plans to give his colt the equivalent of a month off
before regrouping for the rest of the 1989 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is headed for the $1-million Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 19, with the
$500,000 Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on July 29 to serve as a prep.
</P>
<P>
The Travers is 1 1/4 miles, the same distance as the Derby, but Whittingham
isn't saying whether the Travers will be considered. After the Belmont, Arthur
Hancock III, Sunday Silence's principal owner, was talking more about the
$3-million Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 than he was the Travers. If Sunday
Silence skips the Travers, he probably would prep for the Breeders' Cup with a
race during Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
There are no major races on dirt for 3-year-olds in California during the
summer. A race that might tempt Whittingham is the $1-million Super Derby at
Louisiana Downs on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Whittingham finished third in the Belmont with Ferdinand after the
colt won the Derby and ran second in the Preakness. Ferdinand, who had minor
physical problems, was given the rest of the year off. The next year, as a
4-year-old, Ferdinand was raced extensively early in the year and got a
two-month breather before he won a stake at Santa Anita in November, won the
Breeders' Cup Classic two weeks later and then was voted horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
Observers foresee the 76-year-old trainer doing the same thing this year with
Sunday Silence -- giving him time off until the fall and then running him in
the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Horses who win the first two legs of the Triple Crown but lose the Belmont
still usually win the 3-year-old championship. Of the 11 horses who lost the
Belmont after winning the first two races, seven were voted the title. Two of
the Triple Crown spoilers, Stage Door Johnny in 1968 and Arts and Letters in
1969, were voted top 3-year-old colt, and Arts and Letters also won horse of
the year.
</P>
<P>
After Kauai King won the Derby and Preakness in 1966 and then ran fourth as
Amberoid won the Belmont, Buckpasser won the division title and was also voted
horse of the year. Buckpasser didn't run in the Triple Crown, but won the
Travers and also beat older horses in the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
Buckpasser was raced by Ogden Phipps, the owner of Easy Goer, and the
80-year-old investment banker says that Easy Goer could be even better. Some
horsemen say that he already is, having recovered from the disappointments in
the Derby and Preakness to run one of the strongest Belmonts.
</P>
<P>
Nine horses won the Belmont by larger margins, but Easy Goer's time of 2:26
ranks behind only Secretariat's 2:24 when he won the Triple Crown in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Because of his tour de force Saturday, Easy Goer may be considered the nominal
leader of the division until he and Sunday Silence meet again. If the rematch
is in the Breeders' Cup, the distance will be 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
"When we get back to 1 1/8 and 1 1/4 miles, the result might be the same as the
Derby and the Preakness," Whittingham said.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Here's the breakdown on how the $1-million bonus was divided among Sunday
Silence's camp: Principal owner Arthur Hanock III received $385,000; partner
Ernest Gaillard, $192,500; Charlie Whittingham, as minority owner and trainer,
$292,500; jockey Pat Valenzuela, $100,000; and the barn help -- exercise rider,
groom, et al -- $30,000 each. Imaginative minds painted the scenario that
Calumet Farm, which owns Le Voyageur, brought the colt from France to run in
the Belmont so he could burn out Sunday Silence with his speed and enable Easy
Goer to win. Easy Goer is a son of Alydar, who stands at stud at Calumet in
Lexington, Ky. But Patrick Biancone, Le Voyageur's trainer, said that he had
been planning to run in the Belmont since March. . . . The Valenzuela riding
family has now failed to win the Triple Crown with three horses that failed in
the Belmont. Milo Valenzuela couldn't win the Belmont after taking the Derby
and Preakness with Tim Tam (1958) and Forward Pass (1968). Pat Valenzuela is
Milo's nephew.

MAYBE IT'S TIME EASY GOER GETS A DIFFERENT RIDER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL CHRISTINE

<TEXT>
<P>
It is clear by now that Sunday Silence may not be much better than Easy Goer at
1 1/4 miles, but he is better.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer may still be the better horse at longer distances, but that is
academic, because 1 1/2-mile races aren't written by racing secretaries that
much anymore, and even if they were, Sunday Silence's trainer, Charlie
Whittingham, is too smart to run his colt in them.
</P>
<P>
There are still those die-hards around, however, who maintain that Easy Goer
would also be better than Sunday Silence at 1 1/4 miles, if he had someone
other than jockey Pat Day on his back.
</P>
<P>
It is the right time for Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer, to find out.
McGaughey owes it to himself, the horse and owner Ogden Phipps, to see whether
Easy Goer will run more consistently and make fewer mistakes with a more active
jockey.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer and Day have won 12 races together, but after they lost by a long
neck to Sunday Silence last Saturday in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream
Park, the score for the year was Sunday Silence 3, Easy Goer 1.
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, riding Sunday Silence for the first time because of Pat
Valenzuela's suspension for drug use, wasn't as worried as Arthur Hancock about
Sunday Silence protecting his lead in the final strides of the Classic. In his
box seat, Hancock, the principal owner of Sunday Silence, was on his knees by
the time the 1 1/4-mile race was over.
</P>
<P>
McCarron reached the wire with Sunday Silence much the way he finished on
Alysheba in the Classic the year before at Churchill Downs. Alysheba held off
another Day-ridden McGaughey colt, Seeking the Gold, by about the same margin
as last Saturday's, but McCarron never had the feeling that he was going to
lose that one, either.
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer is indeed a horse for the ages, he should have been able to
overcome Day's tentative handling, because he had dead aim on Sunday Silence
through Gulfstream's 952-foot stretch. Day hit Easy Goer 15 times through the
lane, while McCarron, true to Whittingham's prerace instructions, didn't strike
Sunday Silence once.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great temptation to hit him a few times," McCarron said. "But you
only want to hit a horse when you feel he's not doing his best. I never felt I
needed to hit Sunday Silence. When he started to drift in a bit, I just waved
the stick at him on the left side and he straightened out."
</P>
<P>
Whereas McCarron's ride was similar to last year's Classic, Day's ride was a
lot like the one he gave Forty Niner against Winning Colors when the filly won
the 1988 Kentucky Derby. Perhaps puzzled with what to do with Winning Colors'
ability to get off to an uncontested early lead, Day stopped and started with
Forty Niner, and their surge in the stretch left them a neck short at the wire.
</P>
<P>
For an objective opinion on whether Day needs to be replaced on Easy Goer, Thad
Ackel qualifies as much as anybody. Ackel trained Great Communicator, who won
the Breeders' Cup Turf in 1988, and attended this year's races only as a
spectator. His roots -- and his accent -- are Louisiana, and although he's
considered a California trainer now, he has no allegiances to the camps of
either McGaughey or Whittingham.
</P>
<P>
"I know Pat Day's record but the plain truth is that he doesn't fit this
horse," Ackel says. "You've got a patient horse and a patient jockey, and
that's not a very good combination when you're trying to beat a horse as quick
as Sunday Silence."
</P>
<P>
Ackel saw Easy Goer up close at Gulfstream for the first time, going to the
paddock before the Classic, and although McGaughey shrugs off references to the
colt's puffy ankles, Ackel believes that they should be the source of concern.
</P>
<P>
"He's got a couple of osselets (enlargements of the fetlock joints usually
caused by excess fluid)," Ackel said. "And it looked to me like there's some
calcification there. I was surprised that such a good horse could have ankles
like that."
</P>
<P>
Whereas Sunday Silence is an easy horse to ride -- Whittingham said that at
least a dozen jockeys could have handled the assignment if he hadn't given it
to McCarron -- Easy Goer has given Day problems.
</P>
<P>
Last year, when he was beaten by Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Easy
Goer broke poorly and then in the stretch run tried to jump track marks from
the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer has had several other bad starts -- in the Kentucky Derby, the
Preakness and now in Saturday's Classic. On Saturday, he also had trouble
changing leads -- shifting weight by changing lead feet -- coming out of the
stretch turn. Sunday Silence, by contrast, changes leads so easily that
McCarron can't even tell the horse is doing it.
</P>
<P>
"He reminds me of John Henry a lot the way he changes leads," McCarron said.
"You can't even feel it. He does it effortlessly."
</P>
<P>
Still, Easy Goer will be a formidable opponent if he meets Sunday Silence in
next fall's Classic at Belmont Park. The distance won't be 1 1/2 miles, which
it was when Easy Goer beat Sunday Silence for the only time in this year's
Belmont Stakes, but those sweeping turns at the New York track will help
McGaughey's colt.
</P>
<P>
They have already helped him. Easy Goer ran second at Belmont in the first race
of his life, but he has won six straight there since then.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Breeders' Cup officials are lucky that On the Line, who was clobbered at the
start of Saturday's Sprint, was able to be removed from the track without much
delay after the race. If On the Line's leg injury had required his being
destroyed on the track, the delay would have taken the Classic, the day's final
race, past the twilight zone and into darkness. The same thing happened at
Churchill Downs last year. The Breeders' Cup is playing it too close to the
vest with its post time for the final race.
</P>
<P>
Zilzal, the English colt, has been retired and will stand at stud at the farm
of his owner, Sheik Mana al Maktoum, in Kentucky. Zilzal, the favorite in the
Breeders' Cup Mile, was typically washed out in the post parade, delayed the
start when he wouldn't get in the gate and then broke slowly before finishing
sixth. His jockey, Walter Swinburn, was critical of the way the outriders
handled Zilzal. "If they had just left him alone, he would have been all
right," Swinburn said.
</P>
<P>
Sunshine Forever, who was last in the Breeders' Cup Turf and didn't win a race
all year after winning the male grass title in 1988, has been retired. . . .
Star Lift, the French horse who was third in the Turf, has been turned over to
Wayne Lukas, who also trains Steinlen, the Mile winner, for owner Daniel
Wildenstein. . . . Caltech, who despite his name has never run in California,
is headed for Hollywood Park. The Budweiser International winner led until
mid-stretch in the Turf before finishing fifth.

There are clues if you look for them.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Valenzuela arrived Monday, five days before the Kentucky Derby. He is
here to ride Sunday Silence, the West Coast colt who will be second choice to
the Phipps family's entry of Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring. He's here to
familiarize himself with the Churchill Downs racing strip, but five days is
awfully early.
</P>
<P>
Then, there are interviews with trainer Charlie Whittingham.
</P>
<P>
Each one includes some variation of the statement, "If Easy Goer isn't a wonder
horse, he's in trouble."
</P>
<P>
Monday, Whittingham upgraded Sunday Silence's standing. "Any horse that beats
this horse (Sunday Silence) wins the race."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence showed how good he could be when he won the Santa Anita Derby by
11 lengths. Before that, he won the San Felipe Handicap by 1 3/4 lengths. He
has lost twice. The first was by a neck in his debut and the second was by a
head to Houston, who is in the Derby but has not run well recently.
</P>
<P>
A clue as to how high Whittingham regards Sunday Silence came last fall. While
most of the racing world was settling in at Churchill Downs for the Breeders'
Cup, Whittingham was trying to get back to Hollywood Park to see the colt win a
maiden race.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham had several good horses in million-dollar races, but instead he was
thinking about a 2-year-old maiden back home.
</P>
<P>
The colt is by Halo from a mare named Wishing Well. It has overcome a troubled
childhood to become a star.
</P>
<P>
Plain and simple, no one wanted the colt. Arthur Hancock of Stone Farm in
Paris, Ky., wound up owning and racing him almost by default.
</P>
<P>
"He was a weedy horse," said Hancock. "He reminded you of a skinny teen-ager."
</P>
<P>
When Sunday Silence and Houston first raced, in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance at
Hollywood Park last December, Whittingham told trainer Wayne Lukas in the
paddock, "If I'm ever going to beat you, it'll have to be today."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence led until the last few strides before Houston won at the wire.
</P>
<P>
And there was then no doubt: Both colts were headed for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Houston won the Bay Shore so impressively that when he
returned to Santa Anita for that track's Derby, he was favored. But he dropped
out of contention after a half-mile. Sunday Silence moved into a top spot.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence won't be favored Saturday. Easy Goer deserves that title. He
probably will go off at odds of 1-2 or less. If he is bet down to less than
2-5, he would be the shortest-priced favorite in modern times of the Derby.
</P>
<P>
But Easy Goer still needs to win on the track.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham won his first Derby with Ferdinand in 1986. Three years later, he
thinks he has another winner.

DESPITE ITS SUCCESS, MCGAUGHEY WANTS TO AVOID THE NO. 1 POST

Although post positions in a 1 1/2-mile race with only 10 starters would not
figure to be a factor, and even though No. 1 has been the most popular post for
winners of the Belmont Stakes in the last 81 runnings, trainer Shug McGaughey
says that the rail is the only spot he doesn't want Easy Goer to get when the
draw for Saturday's race is held today.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, whose Sunday Silence will try to beat Easy Goer
for the third time in the Triple Crown races and become the 12th horse to sweep
the series, doesn't seem to be concerned about post positions. That McGaughey
would mention them is an indicator that Easy Goer's camp is more concerned
about Belmont strategy than Whittingham is.
</P>
<P>
"Post positions could have something to do with the race," McGaughey said
Wednesday. "If we would draw the No. 1 spot and Sunday Silence winds up
someplace on the outside, they could force our hand. They could keep us down
there the entire race, and maybe make my rider (Pat Day) take up in order to
get out."
</P>
<P>
After winning the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/2 lengths, Sunday Silence beat Easy
Goer by a nose in the Preakness, the second Triple Crown race, with the
winner's jockey, Pat Valenzuela, trapping McGaughey's colt on the fence during
the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
Since 1905, 20 Belmont winners have broken from the No. 1 post, although no
horse starting on the fence has won since Secretariat in 1973. The next best
post during this period has been the No. 3 hole, which has accounted for 12
winners. Only six horses from outside the No. 7 post have won.
</P>
<P>
Maybe Whittingham would like the No. 1 post for Sunday Silence if McGaughey
doesn't want it. Six of the Triple Crown champions -- Sir Barton in 1919,
Gallant Fox in 1930, Count Fleet in 1943, Assault in 1946, Citation in 1948,
and Secretariat in 1973 -- started on the rail. Omaha in 1935, Whirlaway in
1941 and Affirmed in 1978 all won from the third spot. Seattle Slew in 1977 was
No. 5, and War Admiral in 1937 was No. 7.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 expected starters in the Belmont, only one, Le Voyageur, has run the
stake distance of 1 1/2 miles, and the French import, who will be making his
first start on dirt and first appearance in America, will probably be the
longest price on the board.
</P>
<P>
Le Voyageur -- which means the traveler -- led for 1 1/8 miles and then
finished last in a six-horse, 1 1/2-mile minor stake on April 18. Le Voyageur,
who will be ridden Saturday by Randy Romero for the first time because trainer
Patrick Biancone figures that an American jockey will help, has won only one of
six starts and is winless this year in three tries.
</P>
<P>
Biancone, who says that Le Voyageur has trained well on dirt surfaces in
France, is a top international trainer who worked briefly as an assistant for
Le Roy Jolley here in 1974. Jolley is starting Irish Actor in the Belmont. When
All Along, a 4-year-old filly, won the American horse-of-the-year title for
Biancone in 1983, she won the Turf Classic at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
No defections are expected in the Belmont should the track come up muddy. There
has been heavy rain here for two days and the track was sloppy Wednesday.
Clearing is expected today, with temperatures in the 70s. It is supposed to be
in the 80s Friday and Saturday, with a 30% chance of showers both days. Four of
the Belmonts run this decade have been on off tracks.
</P>
<P>
Besides Sunday Silence, Le Voyageur and the entry of Easy Goer and Awe
Inspiring, the other starters will be Fire Maker, Hawkster, Imbibe, Irish
Actor, Rock Point and Triple Buck.
</P>
<P>
For those with more arcane tastes in handicapping, Easy Goer is a real longshot
because a horse whose name started with an E hasn't won the Belmont since Eric
in 1889. Alphabetically, Sunday Silence is the favorite because 18 Belmont
winners had names that started with S. Only the letter C has produced more
winners, 20.
</P>
<P>
If there are omens, Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring are in trouble. Dinny Phipps,
the owner of Awe Inspiring and the son of the owner of Easy Goer, was on jury
duty in Brooklyn on Monday when his home in the exclusive suburb of Old
Westbury, N.Y., was seriously damaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire occurred near mid-day and considerable furniture, paintings and horse
trophies were removed in time, but there was also much damage. The fire
apparently was started by sparks from a soldering iron that was being used to
repair a roof.
</P>
<P>
This will be the sixth time that the Belmont matches horses who ran 1-2 in the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
In 1937, War Admiral won the Triple Crown with Pompoon fading to sixth in the
Belmont after second-place finishes in the first two races. Arts and Letters, a
runner-up in the Derby and Preakness, reversed the order of finish when
Majestic Prince tried to sweep the Triple Crown in 1969.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Sham ran fifth, beaten by 45 1/2 lengths, in the Belmont after
unsuccessfully chasing Secretariat to the wire in the Derby and Preakness.
Affirmed and Alydar ran 1-2 in all three races in 1978, and in 1987, Alysheba,
Alydar's son, twice beat Bet Twice before running fourth as Bet Twice won the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence paid $8.20 to win at Churchill Downs in the Derby and $6.20 at
Pimlico in winning the Preakness. The best payoffs on Sunday Silence in
off-track betting were $11.80 for the Derby, at Marquis Downs in Canada, and $9
for the Preakness, at Connecticut's OTB. Sunday Silence's low payoffs both were
at Hollywood Park -- $6 for the Derby and $4.60 for the Preakness. . . . Fans
watching the Belmont here Saturday might have to pay attention. The sound
system at Belmont Park might be the worst in the country at a major track and
the new matrix board in the infield is a jumble of closely positioned numbers
that is difficult to read.
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, the best 3-year-old filly in the country, runs Sunday at Belmont in
the Mother Goose, the second leg in New York's three-race series for
distaffers. Open Mind has already won the Acorn and probably will be opposed by
only four horses. One of them is Gorgeous, who has won four straight. . . .
Banker's Lady, a 4-year-old filly who has never lost on dirt, will run Saturday
in the Hempstead Handicap, a supporting stake on the Belmont card. Is It True,
winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile over Easy Goer, is scheduled to
run in another stake at Belmont on Saturday. . . . Bayakoa, the standout
4-year-old filly on the West Coast, will run in the Milady Handicap at
Hollywood Park on June 17. "I'm trying to spot her races about a month apart,"
said trainer Ron McAnally, who will saddle Hawkster in the Belmont.

VARIETY ROAD, AT 6 YEARS OLD, STILL MAKING MOST OF TWO CAREERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, Variety Road beat Ferdinand, who won the Kentucky Derby about two
months later.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, at 24-1, Variety Road beat Ferdinand again, as well as Snow Chief and
Broad Brush, in the San Fernando Handicap at Santa Anita. Ferdinand went on to
recognition as horse of the year, Broad Brush was voted the second-best
handicap horse in the country and Snow Chief beat them both in the Strub, three
weeks after his loss to Variety Road.
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand, Snow Chief and Broad Brush have been sent to stud, but their nemesis
continues to make the most of two careers, as a stallion and a runner.
</P>
<P>
Variety Road, now a 6-year-old, serviced a full book of about 40 mares this
year at Old English Rancho in Ontario, then came back running. Unraced for 7
1/2 months, Variety Road ran a mile in 1:34 2/5 to set a track record at the
Sacramento fair in August. Then he won a small stake last Saturday at Bay
Meadows.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jerry Hollendorfer isn't getting Variety Road ready for a year-end
matchup with Easy Goer, but those last two races were notable accomplishments
for a horse who has chronic sore feet and who once had breathing difficulty
because of partial paralysis on the left side of his face. And Bruce Headley,
who trained Variety Road when he ran in Southern California, can remember
missing the 1986 Kentucky Derby because the horse developed boils on his neck
and almost died after running a 106-degree fever.
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has now had 11 victories and nine seconds in 34 races, earning
about $650,000 for his owner and breeder, Kjell Qvale. It is rare for a horse
to successfully mix racing and breeding careers, but Qvale, a San Franciscan,
also alternated Silveyville between the breeding shed and the track and he
earned more than $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
"Variety Road came back to me the last part of June," Hollendorfer said from
Bay Meadows, where the horse is stabled. "I couldn't believe that he was ready
to run a mile as soon as he was. They jogged him at the farm and that had to
help."
</P>
<P>
Hollendorfer had never trained a horse that went to stud and then returned.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might be a problem, but it hasn't been with this horse," he said.
"He's had his mind on the business of running from the time I got him back. He
looks exactly the same as he did when he left, and as long as his feet aren't
bothering him, I think he'll be better than ever."
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has shown a liking for grass, and Hollendorfer would like to run
him in the Tanforan Handicap at Bay Meadows on Oct. 21. Variety Road may find
the spot familiar. He won the Tanforan last year, which was his last stake win
until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Months ago, Tom Meeker, the president of Churchill Downs, told his shareholders
that the Kentucky Derby track would be the site of the Breeders' Cup again, and
Wednesday the group that sponsors the seven multimillion-dollar races -- some
of them Churchill shareholders -- confirmed that the Louisville track is
getting the event on Nov. 2, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Despite bad weather -- the day was raw and wet and the most important race, the
$3-million Classic, was won by Alysheba in near darkness -- Churchill Downs
drew 71,000 for the Breeders' Cup last year. That broke the record of 69,000
set at Santa Anita in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Three of the first four Breeders' Cups were held in California, to the dismay
of many Eastern horsemen. Since 1987, the races have stayed in the East, with
this year's Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park near Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on Nov.
4 and next year's at Belmont Park in New York. Santa Anita is a strong favorite
for 1992.
</P>
<P>
Churchill Downs will become the first track other than Hollywood Park to have
the Breeders' Cup twice. The weather in Kentucky will always be iffy at that
time of year, but otherwise Churchill Downs is a good place for the races. Its
dirt and grass surfaces are excellent, Louisville can be easily reached by fans
and horsemen, and the races don't get swallowed up by other sports that more
metropolitan areas have.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the people at Churchill Downs are experts at handling big crowds.
They get plenty of practice, with throngs of more than 100,000 commonplace for
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence must be eager to run. The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner,
who has been second to Easy Goer in the Belmont and second to Prized in the
Swaps since then, had been working sensationally at Del Mar, and upon his
arrival at Louisiana Downs for Sunday's Super Derby, he reared in his stall,
suffering a minor bump on the head.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence will be favored against seven other 3-year-olds in the 1
1/4-mile, $1-million race Sunday. Awe Inspiring will be trying to give trainer
Shug McGaughey his second consecutive Super Derby victory and the other
starters are expected to be Dispersal, Bruho, Le Voyageur, Harmony Creek, Big
Earl and Dale's Shotgun.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey saddled the winning Seeking the Gold last year. Eddie Maple and
Laffit Pincay, who have divided victories in six of the first nine runnings,
don't have mounts. Chris McCarron, who won in 1987 with Alysheba, rides Harmony
Creek, and Jorge Velasquez, winner in 1982 with Reinvested, will be astride
Dispersal.
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa's owners will have to pay a $120,000 supplementary fee if their
5-year-old mare is to run against Open Mind, the best filly in the country, in
the $1-million Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
By running against Open Mind on Sunday, in the 1 1/8-mile Ruffian Handicap at
Belmont Park, Bayakoa's camp should learn whether the Breeders' Cup supplement
is worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa finished last as the 7-10 favorite in the Chula Vista Handicap at Del
Mar on Sept. 2. Trainer Ron McAnally thought that the weight -- Bayakoa gave
seven pounds to the winner, Goodbye Halo -- and a fast early pace contributed
to his mare's surprisingly poor performance.
</P>
<P>
As far as the weights are concerned, Bayakoa is hardly doing better in the
Ruffian. She carries high weight of 125 pounds, which is five more than Open
Mind, who is on a 10-race winning streak. Theoretically, Open Mind was assigned
126 pounds, but she gets a six-pound break because she's only a 3-year-old.
Another factor in the Ruffian is Miss Brio, who also carries 120 pounds after
winning the Maskette Mile in her last start.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Toltackitt, a 2-year-old filly, was the fastest qualifier for Sunday's Pacific
Coast Breeders Futurity for quarter horses at Fairplex Park in Pomona. A field
of 10 will run 350 yards for a purse of more than $200,000. . . . The same day,
Fairplex will take bets on the telecast of the Super Derby. . . . Drouilly won
the Pomona Handicap in consecutive years, the second time as a 7-year-old in
1983, and one of his sons, Drouilly's Boy, set the Fairplex track record for
six furlongs with a time of 1:09 1/5 on Tuesday. . . . Prime Ticket is carrying
nightly replays of the quarter horse races from Los Alamitos at 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens, who suffered a broken wrist and hand at Del Mar, isn't
planning on missing his third Breeders' Cup, despite the injuries, and says
that he'll be back riding at Santa Anita in mid-October. . . . Easy Goer is
likely to use a $1-million race as a prep for a $3-million stake. He's expected
to run in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, at 1 1/2 miles at Belmont on Oct. 7, and
then go back to 1 1/4 miles in the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who bruised a foot while winning the Haskell at Monmouth Park,
is expected to run in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. "That's going to be a real
tough race, but I think he'll be up to it, regardless of whether we get a prep
race for him or not," trainer Jerry Hollendorfer said. . . . When River
Memories won the Flower Bowl Handicap at Belmont last Saturday, it was the
5-year-old mare's first victory since the Rothmans at Woodbine in October of
1987.

COUGAR II PROVIDED THRILLS -- AND A LESSON
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after Joe Hernandez sold Cougar II to Mary Jones Bradley, he stopped by
the barn of the new owner's trainer, Charlie Whittingham. Hernandez wanted a
set of Cougar's shoes for souvenirs and he also wanted to cadge a bucket of
carrots.
</P>
<P>
"Get your own carrots," Whittingham told him. "We just gave you $125,000, what
more do you want?"
</P>
<P>
This was in 1970, three years before the Chilean-bred was retired with $1.1
million in earnings, the first foreign horse to have earned $1 million in
purses here.
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Cougar was voted America's best grass horse in 1972 and near the
end of his career, on the third try, he won the Santa Anita Handicap, one of
the country's premier dirt races.
</P>
<P>
At stud, Cougar sired offspring that earned more than $11 million, the most
famous being Gato Del Sol, winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1982.
</P>
<P>
At 23, Cougar's career as a stallion ended suddenly June 11. After having been
bred to a mare, he suffered a ruptured stomach and died before surgery started.
</P>
<P>
On the track, Cougar was an unusual horse in many respects. No pony was needed
to bring him to the post, and he would seem to acknowledge the cheers of the
fans, bowing toward the crowd and then gazing at the tote board. Once he got
rolling, Cougar had a paddling motion not unlike that of a Mississippi River
boat.
</P>
<P>
"He was sort of a ham," Bradley said. "A real crowd pleaser."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham picked him out, but after Bradley committed herself to buying
Cougar, the owner and the trainer debated about who would control the horse.
</P>
<P>
"Charlie finally said that he would take half of him if he went on to win
$250,000," Bradley said. "But I said to Charlie, 'Well, then, that would make
him worth more than $125,000, wouldn't it?' so there was no deal."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham thus earned 10% of Cougar's purses instead of the much higher share
due a co-owner. He still enjoys telling the story as an example of how he won't
allow an owner to dominate him.
</P>
<P>
"But it still was a pretty expensive mad, wasn't it?" is the way Whittingham
finishes the story.
</P>
<P>
Cougar raced in the East as well as in California but he never had much luck on
the road. Rain made the courses soft, which Cougar disliked. But on the dirt in
the 1971 Woodward at Belmont Park, he finished first by five lengths. However,
he was moved back to third by the stewards for causing interference in the
stretch. Bradley believes that that disqualification prevented Cougar from
being voted horse of the year. Ack Ack, another horse trained by Whittingham,
won the title.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who announced the races at Santa Anita for 38 years, missed the
rousing finish to Cougar's career. He died in February of 1972 at 62.
</P>
<P>
Sabona will try to become the first 7-year-old since Native Diver to win the
Hollywood Gold Cup when the stake is run for the 50th time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Native Diver won his first Gold Cup when he was a 6-year-old in 1965, his first
of three straight victories in the stake.
</P>
<P>
Sabona was a winner at 15-1 in the Californian when Ruhlmann, the odds-on
favorite, ran fifth, even though slow early fractions appeared to be in
Ruhlmann's favor. Ruhlmann is not going to run in the $500,000 Gold Cup, at 1
1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
Nasr El Arab is the high weight at 123 pounds. Also expected to run are
Blushing John, 122 pounds; Lively One, 116; Payant, 115; Henbane, 112, and
Paramount Jet, 109. Sabona will carry 116 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Dick Floyd (D-Carson), the assemblyman trying to get a revised state medication
bill passed, says that trainer Roger Stein has a good chance to win his
$25-million lawsuit against the California Horse Racing Board.
</P>
<P>
Stein was the first of several trainers to run a horse that tested positive for
cocaine. He received a suspension, while charges were dropped against the
others for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
"It might turn out better for Stein than if he won all the stakes they run for
the next five years," Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
Dan Issel, former basketball star at the University of Kentucky and with the
Denver Nuggets, formed a syndicate in 1981 that was going to breed horses to be
sold as yearlings. A few years later, however, the horse market bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
Now, the syndicate is on the verge of going out of business. Shares that were
worth about $2 apiece in the beginning were worth only six cents at one point
this year.
</P>
<P>
King Glorious' victory in last Saturday's Ohio Derby was scored against the
second-stringers and worse of the 3-year-old division, but at least the colt
proved that he could handle two turns while making his first appearance outside
California.
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who now has a lifetime record of seven wins in eight starts,
could be a factor against the stars of the division.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Trotter, racing secretary at Arlington International Racecourse and
Gulfstream Park, said that if he had to handicap Triple Crown adversaries
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, he would put them at 128 pounds apiece.
</P>
<P>
"That's strictly based on their comparative records," Trotter said. "But right
now, after he won the Belmont as easily as he did, I would have to say that
Easy Goer is the better horse."
</P>
<P>
While covering the Triple Crown races for ABC television, Jim McKay told a
story about himself as a cub reporter for the Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
His first week on the job, McKay didn't have a desk, so an editor told him:
"Dempsey's on vacation, so you can have that desk this week."
</P>
<P>
When the week ended, McKay still hadn't been assigned a desk and he didn't want
to be caught at Dempsey's desk the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody with a name like Dempsey, I didn't want to cross him," McKay said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, McKay met Dempsey -- Margaret Dempsey. She wasn't upset that another
reporter had been using her desk, and now she's married to McKay.
</P>

Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and second in
the Belmont Stakes, might run in the Swaps at Hollywood Park on July 23. If the
winner of a Triple Crown stake runs in the race, the purse increases from
$200,000 to $400,000. . . . Fast Play, one of last year's best 2-year-olds
before he chipped a knee, won by 4 1/4 lengths at Belmont Park last Sunday in
his 3-year-old debut. Fast Play, a son of Seattle Slew, is merely another top
3-year-old for trainer Shug McGaughey, who already has Easy Goer and Awe
Inspiring.
</P>
<P>
That $1-million bonus won by Sunday Silence in the Triple Crown races also
benefited trainer Charlie Whittingham and jockey Pat Valenzuela and moved both
into first place on the national money list. Whittingham moved ahead of Wayne
Lukas by a few dollars, one of the few times in the last six years that Lukas
hasn't been first this late in the season. . . . Jockey Patti Barton, severely
injured when she was trampled by a horse at Fairmount Park several years ago,
has reportedly received an out-of-court settlement of $400,000 plus $2,000 a
month for life.
</P>
<P>
Owner Gene Klein, talking about his sensational 3-year-old filly, Open Mind: "I
think she'd have had an even-up shot in the Kentucky Derby, especially the way
the race was run. But look at the size of her -- she's so little. And if she
had won the Derby, then the temptation would have been to put her in the
Preakness, and that wouldn't have been fair to do that to such a little filly."
. . . Angel Cordero is now one for 19 in the Belmont Stakes.

In his last race, the Oaklawn Handicap in Arkansas a month ago, Blushing John
lost a shoe leaving the gate and still finished fourth, beaten by only two
lengths.
</P>
<P>
Saturday at Pimlico, Blushing John took better care of his footwear and through
the stretch he was a study in footwork. He shook off a familiar rival, Proper
Reality, near the sixteenth pole and rolled to a two-length victory in
track-record time in the $700,000 Pimlico Special before 16,211 fans in cool,
overcast weather.

While winning $420,000 for his owner, Allen Paulson, the 4-year-old colt ran 1
3/16 miles in 1:53 1/5, breaking by a fifth of a second the official record
that Tank's Prospect set in winning the Preakness in 1985. The Daily Racing
Form also credited Secretariat with a 1:53 2/5 when he won the Preakness in
1973. A suspect track timer clocked the eventual Triple Crown winner in only
1:55.
</P>
<P>
By finishing ahead of Proper Reality for the third time in less than two
months, Blushing John sent Pat Day to a winner's circle that the red-haired
jockey would like to return to next Saturday, after he rides Easy Goer in the
Preakness. Easy Goer and Day were upset by Sunday Silence in the Kentucky Derby
and have a rematch coming up at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is a prelude to next week," Day said Saturday, before catching a
plane to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Blushing John's record came on a track that was wet earlier in the week and
then dried out to become lightning-fast Saturday. Cheaper horses were routinely
running six furlongs in times under 1:11, on a track where the record of 1:09
1/5 has stood for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Blushing John carried 117 pounds, one less than Proper Reality, who went off at
a surprising 13-1. After Proper Reality, it was 1 1/4 lengths back to Granacus,
an 80-1 shot who finished a half-length ahead of Cryptoclearance. Top-weighted
at 123 pounds, Cryptoclearance and his stablemate, Lustra, were the 8-5
favorites. Cryptoclearance was typically sluggish in the early going, trailing
the pace-setting Slew City Slew by about 20 lengths going down the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
Following Cryptoclearance to the finish line, in order, were Brian's Time,
Saratoga Passage, Stalwars, Slew City Slew, Templar Hill, Lively One and Little
Bold John. Lustra, running in the race solely to make sure that Slew City Slew
didn't run off to an uncontested early lead, broke poorly and after running
with Slew City Slew for three-quarters of a mile was eased by jockey Tony
Graell.
</P>
<P>
Blushing John paid $16.20, $11 and $8.40. Proper Reality paid $13.40 and $10
and Granacus returned $15.40.
</P>
<P>
Paulson, an aerospace executive who has farms in California, Kentucky and
Georgia, privately bought Blushing John, a son of Blushing Groom and La Griffe,
for $850,000 as a yearling. The horse was bred in Kentucky, but began his
racing career in 1987 in Europe. There he won two of six starts, including a
major race in France as a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Blushing John's first American appearance was a 10th-place finish in the
Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs last November. This spring, trainer Dick
Lundy took Blushing John to Arkansas and raced him on dirt for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"He had trained so well on dirt," Lundy said. "He had a good foot for it, and
the first time we ever breezed him, at our training center in California, he
handled the dirt super."
</P>
<P>
Blushing John won an allowance race at Oaklawn Park, then moved into stakes
competition there. He won the Razorback Handicap, finishing 4 1/2 lengths ahead
of Proper Reality, who ran third as the 1-5 favorite. Slew City Slew beat both
of those horses with a wire-to-wire performance in the roughly run Oaklawn
Handicap, with Blushing John finishing fourth and Proper Reality fifth.
</P>
<P>
"He blew a shoe in the first jump that day," Day said of Blushing John on
Saturday. "He over-reached and lost it. So he had to run the race with three
shoes. Today he had a faultless trip and he responded big when I asked him."
</P>
<P>
Blushing John and Proper Reality were close to each other throughout the race
Saturday. "We couldn't have been more than three or four feet away from each
other all the way, until the other horse pulled away," said Jerry Bailey,
Proper Reality's jockey. "We didn't plan it that way, that's just the way it
happened."
</P>
<P>
There were fast fractions of 1:10 for six furlongs and 1:34 2/5 for a mile.
Slew City Slew held the lead over Lustra and Little Bold John starting down the
backstretch, with Blushing John and Proper Reality in close pursuit.
</P>
<P>
Turning for home, Slew City Slew started to weaken, and from the eighth pole
home, it was a two-horse race. Proper Reality, on the inside but well away from
the rail, drifted out slightly and brushed with Blushing John as they neared
the sixteenth pole. However, the contact didn't faze the winner.
</P>
<P>
Blushing John has a bright future on both dirt and grass, especially since he
now knows how to run with all of his shoes on his feet.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dick Lundy said there are no immediate plans for Blushing John, but the
next objective is the Arlington Million, on the grass, on Sept. 3. . . .
Imbibe, who finished second to Fire Maker in the Withers at Belmont Park last
Wednesday, was in but is now out of next Saturday's Preakness. Imbibe's next
race probably will be the Peter Pan at Belmont on May 28. . . . Northern Wolf
is now a Preakness starter and Jo Jo Ladner, who rode him to a sixth-place
finish in the Kentucky Derby, retains the mount. Ladner is currently serving a
five- day suspension from the stewards at Churchill Downs for what they called
a "careless" ride in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
Other Preakness starters are expected to be Sunday Silence, Easy Goer, Dansil,
Hawkster, Houston, Pulverizing and Rock Point. . . . Sunday Silence, the Derby
winner, might work five furlongs at Pimlico on Tuesday. . . . In other stakes
at Pimlico Saturday, Kent Desormeaux rode Thirty Eight Go Go, at 2-5, to a
three-length victory over Double Bunctious in the $100,000 Geisha Handicap and
Montoya, under Laffit Pincay, paid $4 for winning the $37,450 Miss Preakness by
2 1/2 lengths over Another Boom and Cojinx, who dead-heated for second.

EARLY START IS NOT NECESSARY FOR KENTUCKY DERBY HOPEFULS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the early bulletins on the candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby
have been negative.
</P>
<P>
King Glorious is hurt, and sidelined indefinitely. Is It True underwent knee
surgery, as did Fast Play. Winners Laugh looks like no more than a sprinter.
Houston is in exile. Rob an Plunder can beat only second-rate horses. Great
Genes is dead, even though a future book in Las Vegas keeps taking bets on him.
</P>
<P>
The best healthy 3-year-old in California is To Be Announced. The second best
3-year-old in Florida is Could Be Anyone.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, last year's champion 2-year-old, has avoided the ill winds, safely
stabled at Florida's Gulfstream Park, where his 3-year-old campaign has
consisted of 2 workouts. Easy Goer is not scheduled to run until March 4, in a
7-furlong race at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
But what's right for Easy Goer has been right for many of the Kentucky Derby
winners in the last 20 years. Since 1969, only 6 of the 20 Derby winners made
their 3-year-old debuts as early as January. Nine of the winners first raced in
March of their victorious years, and five others didn't get started until
February.
</P>
<P>
It's not even necessary for a Kentucky Derby champion to win his first race as
a 3-year-old. In the 1980s, only 4 Derby winners -- Swale, Sunny's Halo and the
2 fillies, Winning Colors and Genuine Risk -- started off their years with
victories. Alysheba and Gato Del Sol were winless as 3-year-olds going into the
Derby, although Alysheba finished first in the Blue Grass at Keeneland and was
then disqualified for fouling another horse in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
Here's a rundown on previous Derby winners, starting with last year's and going
back to 1969:
</P>
<P>
Horse -- 1st Race as 3-year-old; 1st Win As 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors -- Jan. 20, Jan. 20
</P>
<P>
Alysheba -- March 8, Derby
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand -- Jan. 4, Jan. 29
</P>
<P>
Spend a Buck -- March 23 April 6
</P>
<P>
Swale -- March 7, March 7
</P>
<P>
Sunny's Halo -- March 26, March 26
</P>
<P>
Gato Del Sol -- Feb. 25, Derby
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Colony -- Feb. 16, April 18
</P>
<P>
Genuine Risk -- March 19, March 19
</P>
<P>
Spectacular Bid -- Feb. 7, Feb. 7
</P>
<P>
Affirmed -- March 8, March 8
</P>
<P>
Seattle Slew -- March 9, March 9
</P>
<P>
Bold Forbes -- Jan. 24, Feb. 28
</P>
<P>
Foolish Pleasure -- Feb. 12, Feb. 12
</P>
<P>
Cannonade -- Feb. 20, April 27
</P>
<P>
Secretariat -- March 17, March 17
</P>
<P>
Riva Ridge -- March 22, March 22
</P>
<P>
Canonero II -- Jan. 9, Jan. 9
</P>
<P>
Dust Commander -- Jan. 10, April 8
</P>
<P>
Majestic Prince -- Jan. 7, Jan. 7
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Derby game has changed for trainers since 1974 -- the year
Cannonade won -- because not only must they have their horses ready to run 1
1/4 miles on the first Saturday of May, they must also have enough earnings for
their horses to qualify to start if the field exceeds the 20-horse limit.
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, you don't want to do too much with a horse, but on the other hand
you've got to make sure you've got the purse money to get in," says trainer
Charlie Whittingham, who won the Derby with Ferdinand in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, whose sire, Halo, was represented in the Churchill Downs
winner's circle by Sunny's Halo in 1983, is Whittingham's best 3-year-old.
After running second to Houston at Hollywood Park on Dec. 3, Sunday Silence was
on the shelf, but he resumed workouts at Santa Anita last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The 7-furlong Hutcheson, the stake that Swale and Spectacular Bid both used to
launch their Kentucky Derby campaigns as 3-year-olds, will be run Saturday at
Gulfstream. Tricky Creek, who won the Kentucky Jockey Club at Churchill Downs
last November, is expected to run.
</P>
<P>
Western Playboy, who ran second to Tricky Creek, is another probable for
Saturday. With 129 horses eligible, the Hutcheson should draw a large field.
</P>
<P>
Rusty Arnold, who trains Tricky Creek, plans to run him in the 1 1/16-mile
Fountain of Youth Feb. 18 and then in the 1 1/8-mile Florida Derby March 4.
Arnold has 3 other promising 3-year-olds -- Trapp Mountain, Traskwood and
Harperstown -- in Florida.
</P>
<P>
When Awe Inspiring won a 7-furlong allowance at Gulfstream Jan. 14, his jockey,
Jose Santos, was impressed, or at least his agent was.
</P>
<P>
"This horse might be something," said Frank Sanabria, the agent for the rider
who will be at the Century Plaza Hotel to receive his 1988 Eclipse Award a week
from Friday.
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring won the first race of his life last September at Belmont Park,
then 3 weeks later led early and faded to fourth on an off track. Coming back
from a 3 1/2-month layoff at Gulfstream, the son of Slew o' Gold rallied from 7
lengths off the pace to win by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring is trained by Shug McGaughey, who also has Easy Goer.
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer to 4 victories and 2 seconds in 6 starts as a
2-year-old, has won 3 Eclipse Awards in the 1980s, but is 0 for 6 in the
Kentucky Derby. Day got off Alysheba a race before the Derby in 1987, opening
the mount for Chris McCarron, and wound up on Demons Begone, the Derby favorite
who hemorrhaged and didn't finish.
</P>
<P>
Day said that one of the reasons he abandoned Alysheba was that he thought the
horse had "second-itis." Alysheba, who will be formally named horse of the year
for 1988 on Saturday during a ceremony at Santa Anita, had won only once going
into the Derby.
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer makes it to the Derby, he will give Day his second favorite there
in 3 years. Last year, Day and Forty Niner just missed catching Winning Colors
at the wire, finishing a neck short.
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer was second (to Is It True) in the Breeders' Cup, but I think he'll
come back and vindicate himself," Day said. "He's right mentally and he's very
mature for a young horse. My confidence in him hasn't diminished a bit."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Double Quick, winner of the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows, is headed for
Oaklawn Park in Arkansas. Trainer Mel Stute is considering 3-year-old stakes in
Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Florida for the colt. . . . Mohamed Abdu is
among a 5-horse Santa Anita contingent that will run Sunday in the $100,000
Turf Paradise Handicap. Sandy Hawley will ride Mohamed Abdu, who will carry the
high weight of 121 pounds in the 1 1/8-mile grass race. . . . Santa Anita,
which has had only 8 grass races this season because of problems with the turf
course, has a grass race scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Corey Black, who rode Annoconnor to 3 stakes victories last year, has been
replaced by Chris McCarron, in an owners' decision, for Saturday's $125,000
Santa Maria Handicap at Santa Anita. Annoconnor will carry top weight of 122
pounds. . . . Jockey Antonio Castanon, who had 2 victories in 51 mounts at
Santa Anita going into this week, is moving to Oaklawn Park. . . . Johnny Campo
is no longer training any of Thomas Mellon Evans' horses in the East. Campo,
who won the Kentucky Derby in 1981 for Evans, trained Cherokee Colony, Pleasant
Colony's son, for Evans before the colt was sent to Chris Speckert at Santa
Anita and now he's the favorite for the Strub Stakes on Feb. 5. Evans' Florida
trainer is Ross Pearce, who was successful with No Review before she became a
stakes winner for Speckert.

<P>
THIRD IN JUVENILE IS LUCKY SPOT FOR DERBY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horses that finish third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile have a better record in
the Kentucky Derby than horses that have won the $1-million fall race for
2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when the inaugural Breeders' Cup was run at Hollywood Park, Spend a
Buck was supplemented into the Juvenile for $120,000. His owner, Dennis Diaz,
fell $12,000 short of breaking even when Spend a Buck ran third. But the next
May, the colt won the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
Alysheba, the Derby winner in 1987, ran third in the Breeders' Cup the previous
year. The winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile has never won the Derby.
</P>
<P>
Last November at Churchill Downs, Tagel, a French-raced 2-year-old, ran third
in the Juvenile, finishing 9 1/4 lengths behind the winner, Is It True, and
trailing Easy Goer, the runner-up and 3-10 favorite, by eight lengths.
</P>
<P>
Francois Boutin, the French trainer who has Tagel, was at Santa Anita last
weekend and said that the 3-year-old son of Cox's Ridge is being prepared for
the Kentucky Derby on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Tagel, bought at a Kentucky yearling sale for $725,000 by Allen Paulson, was
sent back to France after the Breeders' Cup. Boutin said that Tagel will run
only one race there -- either in late March or early April -- and return to
Churchill Downs the week of the Derby.
</P>
<P>
Although he seemed to be overmatched by Is It True and Easy Goer, Tagel
actually ran an exceptional race in the Breeders' Cup. It was his first race on
dirt, the first time he has run counter-clockwise, and he went into the race
with a sore mouth. Tagel was undefeated before the Breeders' Cup, having won
twice on the grass at Longchamp.
</P>
<P>
Bold Arrangement, an import from England, ran second to Ferdinand in the 1986
Derby. The week before the Derby, Bold Arrangement finished third at Keeneland
in the Blue Grass, his first American start. Canonero II won the 1971 Derby
coming off prep races in Venezuela, after running a couple of times as a
2-year-old at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
Noel (Spec) Richardson, the last remaining principal from the controversial
match race between Seabiscuit and Ligaroti at Del Mar in 1938, died last week
at 75.
</P>
<P>
Richardson rode Ligaroti, who was nosed out by Seabiscuit in a $25,000
winner-take-all race. Ligaroti was owned by singer Bing Crosby and his son,
Lin.
</P>
<P>
Richardson and George Woolf, Seabiscuit's jockey, were locked in physical
combat through the stretch. In a 1983 interview, Richardson said that if there
had been head-on camera angles, as there are now, the stewards would have
disqualified Seabiscuit and Woolf.
</P>
<P>
Bill Mills of Murrieta Hot Springs was an assistant starter who handled
Seabiscuit in the gate that day.
</P>
<P>
"The gate was pulled into the infield after the start, and that's where the
assistant starters were until the horses passed the eighth pole," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I stepped out onto the track to see the finish from behind.
What I saw does not agree with what Spec Richardson remembers.
</P>
<P>
"Just past the eighth pole, when Seabiscuit started to move ahead of Ligaroti,
Spec reached over and took hold of Seabiscuit's saddle cloth, pulling him back.
As the two horses neared the finish line, apparently Woolf realized what was
happening and reached out and took hold of Ligaroti's bridle rein."
</P>
<P>
Peg Grueneberg's unusual picture of jockey Nate Hubbard clutching his horse's
neck after he was jolted from the saddle at Golden Gate Fields last week is
similar to a prize-winning shot taken at River Downs near Cincinnati in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In the River Downs shot, the horse went down on a sloppy track and was sliding
across the finish line with jockey Bernie Sayler still aboard. Tom Baker, the
photographer, received an Eclipse Award at a dinner in Miami Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks before the dinner, Sayler called the Eclipse organizers, asking if
they were going to pay his way to Florida.
</P>
<P>
"Without me, there wouldn't have been a picture," Sayler said.
</P>
<P>
He had a point, but he still didn't get a free trip to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who rode his first winner at Bowie in Maryland 15 years ago
Thursday, is eligible for the first time to be voted into racing's Hall of Fame
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. McCarron won a record 546 races in 1974 and has about
4,500 lifetime. Another jockey who may be new to the Hall of Fame ballot this
year is Eddie Delahoussaye. Sandy Hawley was on the ballot last year, but Angel
Cordero was the only jockey who polled enough votes.
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality, who hasn't run since the Breeders' Cup, has been assigned 124
pounds for Sunday's $250,000 San Antonio Handicap at Santa Anita. Other
probable starters are Super Diamond, 121 pounds; Cherokee Colony, 120; Payant,
118; Stalwars, 115; and Stylish Winner, 112.
</P>
<P>
A 2-year-old doesn't win world-champion quarter horse honors very often, but in
a close vote, Merganser won the horse-of-the-year title for 1988. Merganser won
three major races, including the $2.5-million All American Futurity. . . .
Sunshine Forever, champion male turf horse in 1988, makes his debut as a
4-year-old on Saturday in the Canadian Turf Championship at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
If Dixieland Brass goes on to win the Kentucky Derby, his trainer, Charlie
Peoples, will be called a genius because he added blinkers back in September.
Dixieland Brass has won four of five starts since the equipment change. . . .
It wasn't well known that Easy Goer suffered sore shins after his second-place
finish in the Breeders' Cup, but the winter-book Kentucky Derby favorite is
training splendidly in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The site for the 1990 Breeders' Cup is expected to be announced on Kentucky
Derby day -- May 6 -- at Churchill Downs. Some Breeders' Cup directors are
uncomfortable with a return to the West Coast -- because Hollywood Park had
operational glitches when the races were held there in 1987 and because of the
recent criticism of Santa Anita's grass course. The favorites for 1990 are
Churchill Downs and Belmont Park. This year's races will be held at Florida's
Gulfstream Park on Nov. 4.

SUNDAY SILENCE, WHITTINGHAM'S BEST 3-YEAR-OLD, FACES 5 TODAY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If trainer Charlie Whittingham knows what he has got in Sunday Silence, he's
not telling.
</P>
<P>
"All I know now is that he's the best (3-year-old) I got," Whittingham said.
"He almost beat Houston, and (Wayne) Lukas says Houston is the best he's got."
</P>
<P>
Although Sunday Silence and Houston have been impressive, neither horse has
been tested in stakes competition.
</P>
<P>
Houston, the $2.9-million yearling who won his only two starts as a 2-year-old,
will be sent to Aqueduct this week for his 3-year-old debut, in the
seven-furlong Bay Shore next Saturday. That leaves Sunday Silence and five
others to compete today in the $150,000 San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
Half of the field for the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe -- favored Music Merci,
Mountain Ghost and Runaway Dunaway -- is trained by Craig Lewis. This is a
tactic that Whittingham has frequently used in important stakes races,
something that the 75-year-old trainer characterizes as "surrounding them."
</P>
<P>
The other starters today are Flying Continental, who Friday was made eligible
for the Triple Crown races, for a late fee of $3,000, and Yes I'm Blue, one of
the lightweights in the stake at 115 pounds. Mountain Ghost and Runaway Dunaway
will carry 114 pounds apiece, 10 fewer than the top-weighted Music Merci, who
in his 3-year-old debut won the San Rafael at Santa Anita three weeks ago.
Sunday Silence carries 119 pounds, and Flying Continental has been assigned
118.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham saw the potential in Sunday Silence before the horse even raced.
Last October, while at Churchill Downs for the Breeders' Cup, Whittingham was
tempted to make a quick trip to Los Angeles, to see Sunday Silence in his debut
in a maiden race at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham finally stayed in Louisville. Sunday Silence, racing greenly, led
at the top of the stretch of the 6 1/2-furlong race before losing by a neck to
Caro Lover.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, at Hollywood Park, Sunday Silence was again matched against
maidens. He won by 10 lengths, running six furlongs in an excellent 1:09 2/5.
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, Sunday Silence graduated to allowance competition, and the field for
the 6 1/2-furlong race included Houston. It was only the second start for
Lukas' huge colt, a son of Seattle Slew. Only one horse -- a Northern Dancer
colt who sold for $3.7 million -- had cost more than Houston at the 1987
yearling auctions.
</P>
<P>
Houston had made only one start -- a 13-length victory at Belmont Park four
months before -- and based on that performance, he was sent off a 4-5 favorite.
The odds on Sunday Silence were 9-5.
</P>
<P>
With both horses carrying 120 pounds, Sunday Silence led by 1 1/2 lengths at
the top of the stretch, but Houston wore him down and won by a head at the
wire.
</P>
<P>
After that, both horses got some time off.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence returned to the races on March 2 at Santa Anita and scored a 4
1/2-length victory, proving he could also handle an off track by running 6 1/2
furlongs in 1:15 2/5.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Silence is a big and growthy colt," Whittingham said. "But he acts like
he can run. He went head and head with Houston through the stretch."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence is not as well-bred as Houston -- who is by Triple Crown
champion Seattle Slew out of the champion filly, Smart Angle -- but his
bloodlines are respectable. Halo, the sire, has accounted for a string of
successful horses, including Sunny's Halo, the 1983 Kentucky Derby winner.
Wishing Well, the dam, was a multiple stakes winner in California, and Sunday
Silence is her first foal to race.

Halo's offspring have been good for Whittingham's morale as well as his wallet.
Lively One was a top 3-year-old last year who bled in the San Felipe, ran
second in the Santa Anita Derby and became a major winner after finishing 12th
in the Kentucky Derby. Goodbye Halo has earned $1.4 million and is one of the
best distaffers in training.
</P>
<P>
"Halos are very feisty, they show a lot of fire," Whittingham said. "This colt
is no different. We should find out more about him after this race."
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock, a Kentucky breeder who is one of the owners of Goodbye Halo, is
the principal owner of Sunday Silence. The other owners are Whittingham and
Ernest Gaillard, a surgeon from La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
Hancock had a horse who ran a neck short, to Advance Man, in the 1982 San
Felipe. All was forgiven six weeks later when Gato Del Sol won the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Besides Gato Del Sol, other non-winning horses in recent runnings of the San
Felipe have gone on to major victories. They include Alysheba, Skywalker,
Nostalgia's Star and Gate Dancer. . . . Chris McCarron, who has won the San
Felipe four of the last seven years, doesn't have a mount in today's race. . .
. Runaway Dunaway isn't nominated for the Santa Anita Derby or the Triple
Crown. . . . Because they have different owners, trainer Craig Lewis' three
horses will run separately in the betting.
</P>
<P>
Making his first start since beating only one horse in the Breeders' Cup
Classic 3 1/2 months ago, Lively One won a $60,000 allowance race Saturday by 3
1/2 lengths over Prove Splendid, with Sarhoob, making his first start on dirt,
finishing third. . . . Robbie Davis, replacing Pat Valenzuela, rode Lively One
for his third winner of the day. Valenzuela told Santa Anita stewards late
Saturday morning that he had the flu and was excused from his mounts.
Valenzuela is scheduled to ride Sunday Silence in the San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor, a Remington Park horse, won the $250,000 Remington Derby
Saturday with California shippers Manastash Ridge and Double Quick running
fourth and seventh, respectively. . . . Russell Baze rode Invited Guest to
victory at Golden Gate Fields in the $100,000 Golden Poppy Handicap, which was
taken off the grass and run on a sloppy main track. . . . Bill Shoemaker rode
Present Value to victory in the $100,000 Portland Meadows Mile.

FRENCH-BASED COLT TAGEL WILL MISS THE DERBY;
</P>
<P>
IS IT TRUE ALSO EXPECTED TO SKIP RACE AFTER A POOR PERFORMANCE AT SANTA ANITA
</P>

<P>
The 115th Kentucky Derby, which seems to be losing more horses than it gains,
shrank again Sunday when Tagel, a French-based colt with globe-hopping
possibilities, was scratched from a stake because of a cough that has been
bothering a number of horses at Longchamps.
</P>
<P>
Tagel, who hasn't run since he finished third, behind Is It True and Easy Goer,
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November at Churchill Downs, needed a strong
race Sunday in order to be considered a Derby candidate.
</P>
<P>
Is It True also was probably eliminated from the Derby after running last in a
sprint at Santa Anita on Friday. Is It True was making his first start since he
underwent knee surgery shortly after the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, the heavy favorite for the Derby and the reason some owners with
marginal 3-year-olds will duck the race, worked five furlongs Saturday at
Belmont Park in an easy 1:00 4/5, in preparation for his appearance in the Wood
Memorial on Saturday at Aqueduct. Trainer Shug McGaughey said that he worked
Easy Goer a day earlier than scheduled because rain in New York figured to make
Belmont's track muddy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Faultless Ensign, the winner of Saturday's Garden State Stakes at Garden State
Park, is not expected to challenge Easy Goer in the Derby, which will be run
May 6.
</P>
<P>
The list of viable candidates for the Derby has been reduced to this:
</P>
<P>
 -- Easy Goer.
</P>
<P>
 -- Sunday Silence, the winner of the Santa Anita Derby, and Hawkster, who ran
fourth in the race.
</P>
<P>
 -- Western Playboy, the troubled winner of Saturday's Blue Grass at Keeneland
and possibly Dispersal, who finished second after twice bumping the winner in
the stretch and almost knocking him sideways.
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston, the favorite who finished fifth in the Santa Anita Derby. After a
workout today at Santa Anita, trainer Wayne Lukas is expected to announce that
Houston will run in the Derby Trial, a week before the Derby.
</P>
<P>
 -- The winner of the Arkansas Derby this Saturday at Oaklawn Park, where
Manastash Ridge will be favored.
</P>
<P>
 -- Possibly the winner of the California Derby, which is also scheduled
Saturday at Golden Gate Fields.
</P>
<P>
 -- Open Mind, who is already stabled at Churchill Downs and will run in either
the Derby or the May 5 Kentucky Oaks for 3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
 -- Majesty's Imp, the second-place finisher to Dispersal in the Louisiana
Derby, who will need a strong performance in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland
next week in order to earn a trip to Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
The average number of starters in the Derby this decade has been 17. It is
beginning to look as if this year's field will be the smallest since
Spectacular Bid won in a 10-horse lineup in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Despite his colt's victory over five other horses in the Blue Grass, trainer
Harvey Vanier knows that Easy Goer will be an extraordinary opponent for
Western Playboy in the Derby. The two horses both have a running style that
brings them from well off the pace.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning at Keeneland, Vanier sounded like a man whose horse is
running for second place in the Derby. "If my horse had just a little more zip,
we might be able to beat that other colt," Vanier said.
</P>
<P>
One good thing for Vanier is that this year's Blue Grass, for the first time
since World War II, was run three weeks instead of nine days before the Derby
and Western Playboy will have the extra time to recover. When Vanier won the
Blue Grass on an off-track -- much like Saturday's -- with Play Fellow in 1983,
the colt came out of the roughly run race and was dull in the Derby the next
week, finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
Voicing a minority opinion, trainer Bud Delp said that Dispersal probably would
have won the Blue Grass if he had been able to run a straight path in the
stretch. Dispersal had a narrow lead when he came from off the fence at the top
of the stretch and slammed into Western Playboy, who was closing in the middle
of the track. A more widespread opinion was that Western Playboy was about to
roll past Dispersal when the first of the two incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
Dispersal will remain here until Thursday, when he will either be shipped to
Churchill Downs, 75 miles to the west, or be sent to Maryland. If he stays in
Kentucky, Dispersal will run in the Derby Trial and Delp will then consider the
Derby. If the other option is used, the objective will be either the Preakness,
the second leg of the Triple Crown, at Pimlico on May 20 or the Jersy Derby at
Garden State Park on May 29.
</P>
<P>
If Delp runs in the Kentucky Derby, it would be like old times for the trainer
of Spectacular Bid, trying to beat a relatively small field at Churchill Downs.
This time, though, Delp would be running one of the Davids instead of the
Goliath.

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE;
</P>
<P>
FRANCE-BASED TAGEL, NOT HOUSTON, IS REAL DERBY MYSTERY HORSE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Houston has been called the mystery horse, and Santa Anita is billing
Saturday's Santa Anita Derby as the mystery race, but the real mystery among
the candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby is a 3-year-old colt who is in
training more than 4,000 miles away from Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
Tagel is his name, and although the France-based, Kentucky-bred horse has yet
to race this year, a consensus of future books in Las Vegas lists him as a
respectable 12-1 to win the Kentucky Derby, which will be run four weeks from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The trend this year is for many horses to go into the Derby lightly raced, but
Tagel's campaign borders on the non-existent. He will run only once, in a mile
race on the grass at Longchamps in Paris on April 16. If he does well, trainer
Francois Boutin will wait until the first week of May to ship him to the United
States, just a few days before the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
The race later this month will be only Tagel's fourth start but he's already
familiar with Churchill Downs. Last November, in his only race on dirt, Tagel
lost for the first time, running third behind Is It True and Easy Goer, in the
1 1/16-mile Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
Tagel broke slowly and was beaten by 9 1/4 lengths, but he still ran better
than seven other 2-year-olds used to racing on dirt.
</P>
<P>
Boutin, who has been exposing Tagel to a dirt training track in France, is
known for shipping horses to America and having them win right off the plane.
He won the Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes twice that way with the brilliant filly
Miesque and he won the Turf Classic with April Run twice in New York, each time
just a few weeks after she ran in the Arc de Triomphe at Longchamps.
</P>
<P>
Tagel's Kentucky Derby prep race is the same one that Blushing John won a year
ago. Blushing John, owned by Allen Paulson, as is Tagel, won the Razorback
Handicap at Oaklawn Park last month.
</P>
<P>
The real mystery in the 52nd Santa Anita Derby is why Mr. Bolg will run and try
to beat undefeated Houston, Sunday Silence and three other horses -- Hawkster,
Music Merci and Flying Continental -- who have won stakes.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg has early speed -- he ran a half-mile in 44 seconds at Santa Anita in
January -- but he has never run beyond seven furlongs and his only two
victories in eight starts have been in races restricted to California-breds.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg is a son of Bolger, who is a speed sire. His dam, Brew Mistress, won
at 1 1/4 miles and there are other indications of stamina on the female side of
Mr. Bolg's bloodlines.
</P>
<P>
"He won that last race (at seven furlongs by five lengths in 1:22 3/5 on March
10) very impressively," said Yves Seguin, who trains Mr. Bolg. "In the race
before that (the Bolsa Chica Stakes), he was a close fourth despite a rough
trip. He has been training specifically for Saturday since his last start."
</P>
<P>
The longest-priced winner of the Santa Anita Derby was Destroyer, who paid
$89.80 when he upset Agitate in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Remember Win, the horse who finished second to Zoffany in the Hollywood Turf
Cup in December 1985?
</P>
<P>
Tendon problems have kept the 9-year-old gelding away from the races ever
since, but Win has popped up in the entries at Aqueduct and will run in a
seven-furlong race there today.
</P>
<P>
Win actually injured his tendon twice, the second time in a comeback attempt
nine months after the Hollywood Park race. He underwent surgery last year and
returned to training in October.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Win would have won the male grass title, but Cozzene won the Breeders'
Cup Mile at Aqueduct at the end of the year and beat him out in a close vote.
</P>
<P>
"He's been doing great since the surgery," said Sally Bailie, Win's trainer.
"We've never looked back."
</P>
<P>
Larry Bramlage, the veterinarian from Ohio State who performed the surgery on
Win, may want to move on to Kerosene, the highly regarded 3-year-old whose
racing career was ended by a tendon injury in Florida this week.
</P>
<P>
Kerosene, who had two wins and two seconds in four starts, would have been one
of the favorites at Hialeah Saturday in the Flamingo, which, along with the
Santa Anita Derby, is one of four remaining major preps for the Kentucky Derby.
The others are the Blue Grass at Keeneland on April 15 and the Wood Memorial at
Aqueduct on April 22.
</P>
<P>
With Kerosene out of the Flamingo, the 9-5 favorite in a nine-horse field is
Awe Inspiring, trained by Shug McGaughey. McGaughey will be at Aqueduct
Saturday, to saddle Easy Goer, the future-book favorite for the Kentucky Derby,
in the Gotham Mile.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is a 1-2 favorite in a field of four. Trainer Wayne Lukas, who is
starting Texian, says openly that he's running for second-place money.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Pat Valenzuela was examined by a Santa Anita track doctor Monday and
given permission to resume riding this week by the stewards. Valenzuela, who is
ranked among the nation's top 10 riders with $1.5 million in purses, rode three
winners Wednesday his first day back.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, for the second time in recent weeks, Valenzuela canceled his
mounts because of illness. Laffit Pincay, who replaced him on Ruhlmann, won the
San Bernardino Handicap. Valenzuela is scheduled to ride Sunday Silence in the
Santa Anita Derby Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Because of his history of drug problems, any absence by Valenzuela causes
suspicion. The stewards ordered Valenzuela to be tested for drugs this week.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Trainer Joe Manzi, who has taken a course on cardiac-pulmonary resuscitation,
put it to use last week on Bruce Ferguson, a horse owner who collapsed at Santa
Anita. Manzi had left the winner's circle after a win by his 3-year-old filly,
Formidable Lady, and was on his way back to watch a television rerun when he
noticed a commotion. "The man was gasping for air and his eyes were going back
in his head," Manzi said. "Everybody was running around and didn't know what to
do. I kept pressing on his heart and pretty soon he started breathing and his
color came back. Then they took him on a stretcher to an ambulance."
</P>
<P>
It was incorrectly written here that Jerry Moss, who owns Ruhlmann, had also
switched from trainer Bobby Frankel to Charlie Whittingham with the
stakes-winning Pay the Butler. Pay the Butler isn't owned by Moss, and Frankel
continues to train the horse. . . . Chris McCarron, back in action after a
five-day suspension, will ride Pranke in the San Juan Capistrano Handicap April
23. . . . Walter Guerra, who has been riding for five years in Florida, returns
to Santa Anita next week. . . . Tenacious Tom, who wasn't nominated for the
Triple Crown races, is the only 3-year-old colt with two stakes wins at the
Santa Anita meeting.
</P>
<P>
Many observers were surprised that John Brunetti, the owner of Hialeah, made a
strong showing in battling the incumbent Del Mar Thoroughbred Club for the
20-year renewal to conduct racing at the seaside track. Brunetti received two
of the six votes from the State Race Track Leasing Commission. Apparently,
though, the votes were cast by commissioners who were not necessarily in favor
of Brunetti, but who were generally opposed to the Thoroughbred Club, which has
operated Del Mar since 1970.

THE HOT SEAT;
</P>
<P>
MCGAUGHEY HAS ONE MORE CHANCE TO SILENCE CRITICS

<P>
The worst seat in a baseball stadium is the manager's. It's hard to see much
from the dugout. And sometimes, the worst place for a trainer to watch a horse
race is from an owner's box seat.
</P>
<P>
That's where Shug McGaughey was standing at Pimlico, in Ogden Phipps' box, when
their Easy Goer lost by a nose to Sunday Silence in the Preakness three weeks
ago. Easy Goer also finished second in the Kentucky Derby, losing to Sunday
Silence by 2 1/2 lengths, and Saturday, in the 121st Belmont Stakes, the New
York-based horse will try to keep his California-based rival from sweeping the
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
The box-seat area is not very elevated at Pimlico, unlike the high stands at
Churchill Downs for the Derby. What's more, McGaughey stands only 5 feet 5
inches, so he didn't see all of the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
As the field neared the far turn, McGaughey still had his horse in view when
Pat Day, the jockey, moved Easy Goer from third place past the second-place
Sunday Silence. Houston was still trying to hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
Said McGaughey: "When I saw that, I said to myself, 'How far are we going to
win by?' "
</P>
<P>
Then McGaughey lost sight of the field for a few moments because the horses
were blocked by the corporate tents in the infield.
</P>
<P>
"When the horses got past the tents, my horse hadn't gone by Houston yet,"
McGaughey said.
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela, riding Sunday Silence, was surprised to see Easy Goer pass him
when he did, but he resisted hustling his mount. There was still almost a
half-mile to go.
</P>
<P>
Then near the top of the stretch, Sunday Silence edged back ahead of Easy Goer.
McGaughey had a good view of that.
</P>
<P>
"That's when I said to myself, 'How far is Sunday Silence going to win by?' "
the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey said he has not seen a videotape of the entire Preakness, but he is
certain about one thing: "It was a strange race."
</P>
<P>
There were many observers who thought that Day, one of the best jockeys in the
country and a three-time winner of the Eclipse Award, had given Easy Goer a
strange ride. McGaughey does not disagree.
</P>
<P>
"When my horse passed Sunday Silence, Pat didn't go on with him, and as a
result we let Sunday Silence get back in the race," McGaughey said.
"(Valenzuela) could have hit the panic button, but he didn't. But Pat (Day)
gave him time to get his thoughts together."
</P>
<P>
McGaughey might have been better off if the Pimlico tents had been in his way
for the stretch run, because he didn't like seeing Easy Goer on the inside,
where Day had less room to maneuver while being crowded into the rail by Sunday
Silence.
</P>
<P>
Day, who unsuccessfully claimed foul against Sunday Silence and Valenzuela,
said that he put Easy Goer on the fence because he was afraid Sunday Silence
would float his colt out into the center of the track if he chose to go around.
</P>
<P>
After the Preakness, Angel Cordero, who had ridden Houston to a sixth-place
finish, was conspicuously present around Easy Goer's barn, prompting
speculation that McGaughey might make a jockey change for the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey says now that he never even considered a switch. He and Day, who
rides mainly in the Midwest, go back a number of years, to the days before
McGaughey was hired by the Phipps family -- days when he was a struggling
claiming trainer.
</P>
<P>
"I've made up my mind that I'm not going to worry about jockeys anymore,"
McGaughey said at his Belmont Park barn this week. "When I was in Kentucky, Day
was so much better than the other riders that it was a daily battle trying to
get him to ride as many of your horses as possible. But in New York -- and in
California -- there are so many good ones that you don't have to worry. And
there are always new ones popping up, like Chris Antley has here recently.
There will be a lot of things that will worry me more the rest of my life other
than which jockeys are going to ride my horses."
</P>
<P>
Day has had several second-place finishes in big races aboard Easy Goer and
Seeking the Gold, another important Phipps horse trained by McGaughey. Easy
Goer also ran second -- to Is It True -- in last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile,
and that outcome, combined with the runner-up finishes in the Derby and the
Preakness, produced a difference of more than $1 million in purses.
</P>
<P>
Seeking the Gold ran second in the Metropolitan Handicap here nine days after
the Preakness, and last year he was second under Day in three other major
races, including the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic. Still, McGaughey remains
Day's staunchest supporter. The trainer cites all of the other close finishes
by the jockey that have gone their way.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence probably will go to the lead Saturday because there's no other
legitimate front-runner in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my horse will be on the lead, unless Sunday Silence wants to
give it to us," McGaughey said. "I think we'll be laying right off the pace.
Then it will be up to Pat (Day) to force Valenzuela into a mistake. Maybe we
can get Sunday Silence on the inside this time."
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, McGaughey will be able to see the entire race. The box seats
are nicely elevated at Belmont, and there are no tall tents in the infield.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. But a horse that won two legs of the
Triple Crown got beat in the Belmont Saturday.
</P>
<P>
I think I've seen this film before. This was time No. 12 this has happened.
This puts it in the majority. Eleven times, it has happened the other way: The
two-time winner has made it a sweep in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
We were supposed to get Dempsey-Firpo. Instead, we got Tyson-Bruno. Easy Goer
flattened Sunday Silence in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
They ran one of the great races ever run at the Preakness. This one looked more
like the Rose Parade. Sunday Silence looked more like a guy chasing a bus than
a horse in a race.
</P>
<P>
You've heard of guys going home from a race track in a barrel? Of guys losing a
bundle?
</P>
<P>
How'd you like to drop $4 million? On one race?
</P>
<P>
That's what Sunday Silence, Charlie Whittingham and Arthur Hancock III left
lying around Belmont Park Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lots of guys have come to New York and gone home wiped out. Usually they buy
the Brooklyn Bridge or a watch from a guy wearing a checkered suit.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's people didn't buy anything that turned green on their arms.
But they could have walked away with $5 million. All Sunday Silence had to do
was win the Belmont. The Triple Crown. He didn't even come close. The
automobile company that puts up that prize must feel like a club that puts up a
new car for anyone making a hole-in-one on a par-five.
</P>
<P>
It still might be the biggest one-day drop in the history of racing.
Bet-A-Million Gates never had a worse score.
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse. The conditions of the bonus are these: Chrysler
guarantees $5 million to any horse winning the Triple Crown. It puts up $1
million to the horse scoring the most points in the three races (five points
for a first, three for a second and one for a third).
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Alysheba won the first two races, then finished fourth in the
Belmont. Another horse, Bet Twice, was second twice and then won the Belmont.
He got the million-dollar bonus. Alysheba got the middle of the doughnut.
</P>
<P>
As unfair as it sounds, it could have happened again to Sunday Silence. A horse
that wins two out of three could shoot the wad by losing one. Sunday Silence
had the presence of mind to finish second. He got the million with 13 points.
The Belmont winner, Easy Goer, ended up with 11.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has not yet had to empty the vault to meet its pledge, but it's plain
the bonus conditions are geared to a save-the-Belmont philosophy.
</P>
<P>
It really wasn't much of a race. Seven of the horses had about as much business
in there as burros. The fourth horse was 20 lengths behind the winner, 12
lengths behind the third horse, and the last horse was 49 lengths behind
everybody. They almost had to delay the next race.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who kicked his trainer in the head Friday, got a lick in at the
bettors, too. He took about a million out of their pockets, going off as
odds-on (4-5).
</P>
<P>
Oh well, nobody's perfect. The story of the race was an immigrant from France.
He did better than anyone from there since Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
Le Voyageur had not only never raced in this country before, he had never raced
on dirt. He wasn't exactly Man o' War but he proved harder to get rid of than
dandruff. Of course, he was the only horse in the race that had ever run a mile
and a half before. In America, they pack a lunch for anything over
seven-eighths of a mile. Le Voyageur must have thought it was a nice little
sprint. He was just getting warmed up when he hit the finish. He led the race
all the way to the far turn. It took the second fastest Belmont of all time
just to shuffle him back to third.
</P>
<P>
All the race really proved was one of the hoariest cliches in racing. This has
been heard in every backstretch in America from camptown meetings to the lordly
Jockey Club. It goes -- repeat after me -- like this: "Horses for courses."
Stripped of the doggerel, it means that some horses don't like some race
tracks.
</P>
<P>
Great race horses can run on glass. But good race horses sometimes curl up
their noses at inferior surfaces and pout.
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make him all bad, but Easy Goer just doesn't like Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
He came up to Churchill Downs last November hailed as the greatest thing on
four legs since Pegasus. But when the Breeders' Cup came up mud, he chased an
inferior sort called Is It True (who ran on the undercard at Belmont Saturday).
He lost.
</P>
<P>
Then, when he didn't lose again until the Kentucky Derby last May under the
same conditions -- greasy track, intermittent rain -- the race track world
concluded he was an indifferent sort. I mean, a great horse doesn't need his
own deck.
</P>
<P>
But what was overlooked was that Easy Goer hooked up with 15 horses on a track
and conditions he hated in the Derby -- and finished second. In the Breeders'
Cup, he took on 10 horses and a surface that irritated him -- and finished
second.
</P>
<P>
When inferior horses hate a track, they finish last. They give up. Sulk. Pout.
Refuse the bit. Lug in. Lug out.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer had too much class for that. It was just his bad luck the most
celebrated race in America took place in a part of the country he found
difficulty standing up in.
</P>
<P>
This is a horse that ran a 1:32 2/5 mile this spring. Only one horse in the
history of thoroughbreds has run faster.
</P>
<P>
Lots of people can't handle Kentucky in the rain. But the burden of the proof
is, Easy Goer is the best in his business when the sun is shining and the track
isn't glassy. And in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Oh, he finished second in the Preakness. If you consider 6 inches off the
winner as second. Only sophisticated optics could determine that it wasn't a
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
When Long Island came up with the kind of weather that capsizes destroyers all
week, the handicappers all but wrote Easy Goer off.
</P>
<P>
But this wasn't Kentucky. Easy Goer just stalked Sunday Silence like that
railroad dick after Butch Cassidy. He just swept by him at the far turn as soon
as he got ready. He ran the fastest Belmont this side of Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
If he stays out of Louisville in the rain, no one can beat him. Of course,
that's a good game plan even if you don't have to run.

EXCAVATE MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Excavate's odds in the Kentucky Derby future book crashed before some of the
Las Vegas casinos learned how to spell his name.
</P>
<P>
Probably because of a slip of the tongue by his trainer, Charlie Whittingham,
the 2-year-old colt had been listed as "Excavator" by at least two Nevada race
books.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after Whittingham's Golden Pheasant had won this year's Arlington
Million, the trainer was unexpectedly asked on national television about his
Kentucky Derby prospects. Whittingham stumbled over the horse's name, it came
out "Excavator," and that's the way it stayed in Las Vegas until recently.
</P>
<P>
But Excavate blew his cover last Saturday at Hollywood Park, running for the
first time and winning at six furlongs by five lengths. It was a debut that
gave Whittingham no reason to disbelieve that Excavate might complete the hat
trick that Ferdinand and Sunday Silence started for the 77-year-old trainer at
Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
Now, based on his one victory in a maiden race, Excavate's odds have dropped
from 30-1 to 3-1 at the Frontier's race book, making him the second choice for
next year's Derby, behind the 5-2 Fly So Free, winner of the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Belmont Park a month ago and a cinch to be voted the Eclipse Award
as divisional champion.
</P>
<P>
The Derby is five months and a jillion land mines away, but if Excavate would
give Whittingham that third sniff of the roses, he would be the most expensive
horse ever to win the race. As a yearling, the son of Mr. Prospector and Anne
Campbell, the Never Bend mare who also produced Desert Wine, was sold for $1.1
million at a Keeneland auction.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas was the underbidder on Excavate, with Whittingham buying the
handsome colt for Dick Duchossois, the owner of Arlington International
Racecourse.
</P>
<P>
After the sale, Arthur Hancock, Excavate's breeder, bought 12% back from
Duchossois and Whittingham has become a 10% owner.
</P>
<P>
Like Whittingham, Hancock became a Derby mainstay in the last decade. He was a
partner in Gato Del Sol, who won the race in 1982. Then in 1989, Hancock,
Whittingham and another partner, Ernest Gaillard, bottled the lightning with
Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
"Excavate is big-boned and tough," Hancock said. "I've liked the horse from the
time he was a foal. I think that running across those 100-acre fields we've got
at Stone Farm (in Paris, Ky.) has really helped him."
</P>
<P>
Hancock turns out his mares when they're just in foal, and one day a group of
them took off running across one of those large Stone Farm fields.
</P>
<P>
"They were running full out and Excavate was running right with them," Hancock
said. "At the end, he beat them. He reminded me of a silver bullet that day."
</P>
<P>
For a horse with such little experience, Excavate has already worked up a mound
of ballyhoo. He has twice been featured on national television, besides the
brief, muffled notice Whittingham gave him that day at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
"I told Charlie about this horse when (Excavate) was still a weanling," Hancock
said. "Another thing I like about him is that he's smart. This is a horse
that's got a world of sense. If everything goes right, he could really be
something."
</P>
<P>
Some trainers might be tempted to thrust Excavate into the $1-million Hollywood
Futurity a week from Sunday, but not Whittingham, who frequently doesn't run
his horses at all when they are 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence raced for the first time on Oct. 30, 1988, and broke his maiden
in his next race, Nov. 13. He had run four times before his first stakes race,
which turned out to be a victory in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita in
March of 1989. He had run just six times going into the Derby.
</P>
<P>
And Ferdinand, the Derby winner in 1986, didn't win for the first time until
Nov. 3 of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
There's something odd about this Sunday's promotion at Hollywood Park. The
track is offering airplane trips for 100 fans to Las Vegas, where the winners
will spend three days at the Riviera Hotel and Casino. Does it make sense for a
track to send bettors someplace else to bet? Did Macy's tell Gimbels? What's
more, the Riviera isn't even among the numerous Nevada horse books that
co-mingle their bets with the mutuel pools at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
Go and Go, the winner of the Belmont Stakes but a disappointment in the Travers
and the Breeders' Cup Classic since then, has drawn the outside post in a field
of eight in Saturday's $100,000 Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park. Rial,
winner of the Oak Tree Invitational and then disqualified after finishing first
in the Burke Handicap at Santa Anita, is the high weight with 122 pounds. He'll
be running on dirt for the first time in this country, with Jose Santos riding
for the first time. Kent Desormeaux will be riding Go and Go for the first
time. Also in the field is Pleasant Tap, third in this year's Kentucky Derby
and eighth in the Breeders' Cup Turf.
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, the leading money-winning jockey this year with a lead of about
$850,000 over Santos, will be riding Aksar Saturday in the $100,000 Bay Meadows
Derby. There will be betting on the race at Hollywood Park. . . . Jerry Bailey
regains the mount on Plenty of Grace for Sunday's $200,000 Matriarch. Bailey
had another commitment at Aqueduct the day Herb McCauley rode the filly to
victory in the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita. . . . Caliente, which has been
closed because of labor problems, will resume racing on Jan. 19.

KENTUCKY DERBY TRIAL AT CHURCHILL DOWNS;
</P>
<P>
HOUSTON GETS CHANCE TODAY TO REDEEM HIMSELF FOR BIG FLOP
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LOUISVILLE, Ky.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Houston doesn't redeem himself today, his name could be changed to
Galveston.
</P>
<P>
The flop of the Santa Anita Derby is favored in the Kentucky Derby Trial on
opening day at Churchill Downs, and a win will carry him into the Derby itself
next Saturday, when Awe Inspiring, Easy Goer's alter ego, is also expected to
run.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Shug McGaughey, who has been reluctant to run Awe Inspiring as an entry
with Easy Goer, the Wood Memorial winner and Derby favorite, indicated Friday
that he would start both colts in the 115th running of the Triple Crown race.
The horses race for the Phipps family, Ogden Phipps owning Easy Goer and his
son, Dinny, owning Awe Inspiring.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey's change of plans makes sense, because Awe Inspiring, a late
developer, won the Flamingo Stakes, a major Derby prep, at Hialeah in his last
start.
</P>
<P>
Under Kentucky rules, the Phipps horses must be coupled for betting purposes in
the Derby, but if they ran separately, Awe Inspiring would probably be the
third betting choice, behind Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, the Santa Anita
Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
Flown here from New York Wednesday, Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring were among the
first horses on the track Friday morning. They each galloped 1 1/2 miles -- a
quarter of a mile farther than the Derby distance -- in the eerie predawn
darkness.
</P>
<P>
Jack Van Berg, winner of the 1987 Derby with Alysheba and a trainer without a
starter in this year's race, was on his stable pony as McGaughey and his wife,
Mary Jane, who is eight months pregnant, watched from the outside rail on the
backstretch.
</P>
<P>
"Run 'em both," Van Berg said to the trainer's wife. "You might never get
another chance to run two colts this good in the Derby."
</P>
<P>
Another horseman on the track was trainer Wayne Lukas, despite a painful back
injury that has prevented him from straightening up for five weeks. Lukas gets
on his pony these days only when Houston trains, and the $2.9-million Seattle
Slew yearling also galloped 1 1/2 miles in preparation for the one-mile,
$75,000 Trial, which is the final Derby preliminary.
</P>
<P>
Houston was undefeated in three starts until he ran fifth as the 4-5 favorite
in the Santa Anita Derby. Sunday Silence beat him by 16 3/4 lengths.
</P>
<P>
Lukas is attributing Houston's sorry performance to the 95-degree heat at Santa
Anita, although other trainers in the race said their horses were not affected
because the humidity was low.
</P>
<P>
"The stalls as Santa Anita were about as ventilated as a coffin," Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
"But one thing about that problem is that it's easily corrected. We had to get
the horse's electrolytes balanced. We've been able to replace his fluids with a
supplement that we've put in his water, fed him directly and even given him
intravenously. We feel that we've got the problem under control."
</P>
<P>
On a wet track listed as fast, Houston worked five furlongs last Monday in a
rousing :58 3/5.
</P>
<P>
The weather has been hot and humid here this week. On Thursday, the temperature
was in the mid-80s, missing the record for the date by one degree. There was
the chance of overnight rain Friday, and rain again early today, and the
temperature at race time might be around 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Six horses are entered in the Trial, which in 62 runnings has produced only
five Derby winners, the last being Tim Tam in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Today's lineup, in post-position order, consists of Affirmed's Image, Belek, In
His Cups, Pulverizing, Houston and One That Got Away. Houston carries 122
pounds, including Laffit Pincay, and spots the opposition three or five pounds
per horse.
</P>
<P>
Trying to make himself comfortable Friday in a director's chair outside a
lavishly redecorated barn office that was only a cinder-block room a week ago,
Lukas borrowed a copy of the Daily Racing Form and checked the records of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Belek, undefeated in three starts, is owned and trained by Louie Roussel, who
gave racing Risen Star, last year's Preakness and Belmont winner after running
third in the Derby. Affirmed's Image has won his last three starts. In His Cups
has won four of his last five races. Pulverizing is a stakes winner from
Maryland and One That Got Away won on grass at Keeneland the other day.
</P>
<P>
Lukas is hoping for an easy win for Houston.
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy race," the trainer said. "There are some horses in there that
know how to win."
</P>
<P>
Houston knew nothing else, until he ran up the track at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Half of the horses in the Derby Trial -- Affirmed's Image, In His Cups and One
That Got Away -- are not eligible for the Triple Crown races and Louie Roussel
says that Belek will not run in the Kentucky Derby because he figures to have
limitations beyond a mile. . . . Notation, who was beaten by Belek at Keeneland
before winning the Lexington Stakes there on Tuesday, will run in the Derby and
Chris Antley is likely to be his jockey.

DREAM RIDE STILL HASN'T ENDED FOR VALENZUELA;
</P>
<P>
AFTER HIS KENTUCKY DERBY VICTORY, HE RETURNS TO HOLLYPARK AND WINS AGAIN
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a toxic overdose of "Easy Goer this" and "Easy Goer that" back in
Kentucky, Patrick Valenzuela returned to Los Angeles early Sunday morning
wearing a self-satisfied smile and bearing a simple, four-word message for the
rest of the racing world:
</P>
<P>
"I told you so."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who punctured Easy Goer's balloon Saturday aboard Sunday Silence,
received a hero's welcome from friends, family and later the fans at Hollywood
Park, where he responded by winning the first race Sunday aboard a $16,000
claimer named Mispu.
</P>
<P>
"He came into the paddock giving me a high five, like we were the Lakers," said
Mispu's trainer, John Sadler. "I didn't even have to give him a leg up. He just
floated onto the horse."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela left Louisville shortly after the Derby and touched down at LAX at
midnight, getting home to Arcadia by 1 a.m. Before hitting the sheets, though,
he cued up the videotape and savored the Derby telecast.
</P>
<P>
"Usually I can sleep on flights coming home, but last night every time I closed
my eyes all I could see was the Derby, coming down the lane through that tunnel
of noise," said the 26-year-old jockey, who rode in two previous Derbies
without winning.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, I sat down with my oldest daughter, Michelle, and made sure she
knew what her dad had done," Valenzuela said. He and his wife, Jeana, have
three daughters: Michelle, 6, Kristin, 3, and Elizabeth, 9 months.
</P>
<P>
"Michelle is old enough to know what it means when I win a big race. I told her
this one was special. This one was maybe the biggest of them all."
</P>
<P>
Michelle was duly impressed. And, as far as Valenzuela is concerned, the rest
of the country should have the same faith that Sunday Silence will get the
better of Easy Goer every time they run, rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
"People were asking me all week if my colt was being underrated," Valenzuela
said. "I told them just the opposite. It was Easy Goer who was being overrated.
I've felt all along that my colt could be a great horse."
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's most stubborn supporters still could be heard the day after the
Derby, blaming his defeat on the weather, the muddy racetrack, even on the
nine-minute delay caused by the reshoeing of longshot Triple Buck.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela had braced himself for the chorus of whining and had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
"Let them say what they want," the rider insisted. "Then, after Sunday Silence
beats him again in the Preakness, let them come up with a new bunch of
excuses."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela spent five days in Kentucky, riding a few races at Churchill Downs,
visiting local breeding farms and stallions (including Halo, sire of Sunday
Silence), and generally avoiding the social whirl of Derby week.
</P>
<P>
He spent his evenings quietly, dining with his wife, his agent, Jerry Ingordo,
and sometimes with Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence's trainer.
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't want anything to do with all the parties," Ingordo said. "He
wanted to keep a low profile."
</P>
<P>
Whenever he showed up at the track, however, Valenzuela was bombarded with
questions about his tumultuous past.
</P>
<P>
Though he ranks as one of the best riders in the country, he carries the added
baggage of well-publicized drug rehabilitations, self-imposed exiles, and more
than a few careless riding suspensions. One year ago he was riding at an
obscure New Mexico track, trying to salvage family, health and career.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody wanted to talk with me about the Derby, that was great,"
Valenzuela said. "But if they wanted to talk about my personal life, I said no,
because that's exactly what it is. Personal."
</P>
<P>
Consider the climate, however. Valenzuela was in a media fish bowl, surrounded
on all sides by eastern-based jockeys who had gone dramatically public with
their own drug- and alcohol-related problems.
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer, and Chris Antley, New York's top rider, were
giving expansive interviews on their private battles.
</P>
<P>
"If that's how they want to handle it, that's fine," Valenzuela said. "Maybe
they have learned something and can help others by talking about it in public.
My hat's off to them.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm still discovering things about myself. I'm still growing. There are
things I will talk about only with my wife and my family. The important thing
is, I'm clean. I feel great. I feel . . . like I just won the Kentucky Derby."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela dedicated his Derby victory to the late Joe Manzi, the well-known
California trainer who died of a heart attack on April 27.
</P>
<P>
"I know, if Joe had lived, he would have won a Derby someday," said Valenzuela,
who rode several major winners for Manzi.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was aboard the Manzi-trained Fran's Valentine when she was
disqualified after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1984, a
professional nadir for both men. The following year, Valenzuela won the
Kentucky Oaks on Fran's Valentine.
</P>
<P>
"When I was in New Mexico last year, Joe was the first person to call me,
asking me to ride in a stakes race for him," Valenzuela recalled. "That's the
kind of friend you never forget."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham continued his unbeatable weekend Sunday at Hollywood Park, sweeping
the first three places in the $107,700 Wilshire Handicap with Claire Marine,
Fitzwilliam Place and Galunpe.
</P>
<P>
It was a virtual replay of the Budweiser/Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita
on April 16, when the full-bodied Irish filly Claire Marine beat Bruce McNall's
Fitzwilliam Place by 1 3/4 lengths. This time the margin was a head, as Claire
Marine got the 1 1/16 miles on the turf in a stakes record 1:39.
</P>
<P>
"Awesome," winning jockey Chris McCarron said. "That man is awesome."
</P>
<P>
He was talking about Whittingham, who has been in Kentucky with Sunday Silence
for more than two weeks and has won four California stakes in the interim. His
assistant, Rodney Rash, has been running the local show.
</P>
<P>
Favored by the crowd of 26,193 on-track, 8,529 off-track, Claire Marine paid
$4.60, $2.60 and $2.10. Fitzwilliam Place, coupled with McNall's Down Again,
returned $3 and $2.10, while Galunpe paid the minimum $2.10 to show.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham owns Claire Marine in partnership with Sidney Port. . . .
Jockeys Alex Solis and Eddie Delahoussaye were back in action Sunday after
taking a day off to recover from Friday's gruesome sixth-race accident. Both
riders were airborne and landed hard, but emerged with only scrapes and
bruises. "I know how to fly," Solis said, "but I forgot how to land." . . . ABC
Derby telecast host Jim McKay dropped Pat Valenzuela's trophy during post-race
ceremonies on Saturday. "And he'd better fix it if it's broken," Valenzuela
said.

TRIPLE CROWN BONUS PLAN SACRIFICES FAIRNESS TO BOLSTER BELMONT FIELD

<P>
In the 1960 World Series, the Pirates were outscored by the Yankees, 55-27, but
Pittsburgh still won the title by taking four of the seven games.
</P>
<P>
The Pirates won by 6-4, 3-2, 5-2, and 10-9, while New York was winning, 16-3,
10-0 and 12-0.
</P>
<P>
However, no one suggested that the Yankees be declared the champions. But under
the rules of racing's Triple Crown, a horse can win two out of the three races
in the series and still not earn a $1-million bonus.
</P>
<P>
That happened in 1987, the first year the $1-million bonus was offered.
</P>
<P>
Alysheba won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, but then missed finishing
third by a neck in the Belmont and blew the bonus.
</P>
<P>
Bet Twice, second in both the Derby and the Preakness, won the Belmont and beat
out Alysheba on points, 11-10.
</P>
<P>
The same thing could happen this year. Sunday Silence, after winning the Derby
and Preakness, can clinch the bonus by finishing at least third if Easy Goer
wins the Belmont. Of course, a win by Sunday Silence at Belmont Park on June 10
gives him a Triple Crown sweep and a $5-million payoff.
</P>
<P>
The problem with the Triple Crown point system of 5-3-1 for first-, second- and
third-place finishes in the three races is that a winner doesn't receive much
more credit than the horse that runs second.
</P>
<P>
The Triple Crown tracks -- Churchill Downs, Pimlico and Belmont -- considered
altering the point system after the Bet Twice-Alysheba anomaly, but decided to
keep it in order to encourage entries for the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the system is unfair. Any horse that dominates a series deserves the
big bucks. Would tennis give the Wimbledon championship to a player who won the
most games, but not the most sets?
</P>
<P>
Since Gato Del Sol won the Kentucky Derby in 1982, six of the last eight
winners have been 3-year-olds who trained in California.
</P>
<P>
The last four Derby winners -- Ferdinand, Alysheba, Winning Colors and Sunday
Silence -- were California-based and in 1983, between the last four and Gato
Del Sol, came Sunny's Halo, who trained at Hollywood Park and swam in the
track's swimming pool before he used a two-race Arkansas schedule to get him
ready for Louisville.
</P>
<P>
The five California horses ran in the Santa Anita Derby. That was the final
Kentucky Derby prep for Ferdinand, Winning Colors and Sunday Silence, with Gato
Del Sol and Alysheba running in the Blue Grass when that Keeneland stake was
run nine days before the Derby.
</P>

None of the California horses were favored in the Kentucky Derby. "I think that
the California horses come to Churchill Downs underrated and the Eastern horses
are overrated," trainer Wayne Lukas said last week. Lukas won the Derby last
year with the filly, Winning Colors.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Anita Derby, which is run a month before the Kentucky Derby, is
perfectly situated for the horse who will need no additional racing experience
before running at Churchill Downs. It is almost certain to be run in good
weather and gives a trainer enough time to get his horse acclimated in
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Wood Memorial, run at Aqueduct two weeks before the
Derby, no longer is a prime prep race. The last horse to come out of the Wood
and win the Derby was Pleasant Colony in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Still, there probably will be no rush of Eastern horses going to the Santa
Anita Derby instead of running in the Wood.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to run in the Florida preps and then ship to Santa Anita,
because we race in the East," said Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer.
</P>
<P>
"We had a good program going into the Derby this year. If you have a hard race
in the Wood, then it comes a little bit too close to the Derby, but Easy Goer
didn't have a hard race this year, and we thought it was just perfect for him."
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker will leave next week for the first part of his retirement tour
abroad. Shoemaker will start in Zurich, Switzerland, and continue through
England, Ireland, the Netherlands, West Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, 57, who hopes to train horses when he retires at the end of the
year, will return to the United States in late July and later in the year he
will visit Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Last week at Pimlico, Shoemaker sat on the porch of the jockeys' room with his
friend, veterinarian Alex Harthill.
</P>
<P>
The track announcer started talking and Shoemaker said: "Geez, Doc, that (South
African) accent sounds exactly like Trevor Denman. How could there be two guys
in racing that sound like that?"
</P>
<P>
"Shoe," Harthill said, "that is Trevor Denman."
</P>
<P>
Denman, the regular caller at Santa Anita and Del Mar who will be calling the
races in Maryland until July 4, says that it's been an adjustment for him at
Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still trying to get used to the horses and the jockeys' styles," he said.
"You get spoiled in California, with all the good horses. By and large, it's a
different class of horse running in Maryland."
</P>
<P>
There have been mixed reviews for the 36-year-old Denman at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
"He sounds too much like a tobacco auctioneer," one fan said.
</P>
<P>
But Clem Florio, a handicapper for the Washington Post, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
"This guy is fabulous," Florio said. "He lets you know what's really going on
in a horse race."
</P>
<P>
When Shoemaker won a race at Pimlico last week, Frank De Francis, the principal
owner of the track, held a $5 win ticket that was worth about $60 on the horse.
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought I'd keep the ticket as a souvenir, because it probably
would be the last time Shoe would ride at Pimlico," De Francis said. "But then
I thought about the $60. I cashed the ticket. I'll get a souvenir of Shoe from
another track."
</P>

Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring will be challenged by Faultless Ensign, Contested Colors,
Manastash Ridge and Irish Actor in the $500,000 Jersey Derby at Garden State
Park on Monday. . . . The same day, On the Line, Seeking the Gold and Simply
Majestic will run in the $500,000 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont Park. . . . On
Saturday, Open Mind, the best 3-year-old filly in the country, runs in the
$150,000 Acorn at Belmont. . . . Some of the 3-year-olds who weren't good
enough for the Triple Crown -- Endow, Music Merci, Mercedes Won and Notation --
will run at Sportsman's Park Saturday in the $500,000 Illinois Derby.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's hoof problems appear to be behind him, even though he loosened
his left front shoe while winning the Preakness. . . . Two horses from France
-- Le Voyageur and Sovereign Water -- are due to arrive in New York next week
to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 10. They will be required to spend 26
hours in the quarantine paddock at Aqueduct before they can be moved to Belmont
Park. Le Voyageur is a son of Seattle Slew and owned by Calumet Farms. . . .
Hawkster, fifth in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, is going to run in the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
Tom Aronson is leaving the American Horse Council to work for Freestate
Raceway, the harness track in Laurel, Md. Starting Wednesday night, Freestate
began experimenting with a system in which post positions won't be known for
horses until after betting is shut off about a minute before the race. Post
positions are more of a factor in harness races. The track says it is trying to
create more betting interest, and it probably will. In harness racing, stables
sometimes don't bet as much on their own horses when they draw outside posts,
but under this setup, no one will know ahead of time where the horses will
start. Big bettors are already complaining about the experiment, because it's a
handicapping factor that's being taken away from them.

PINCAY WILL SKIP THE PREAKNESS TO RIDE IN HAWTHORNE HANDICAP

<P>
While Laffit Pincay was debating whether to ride Houston or Bayakoa Saturday,
Ron McAnally was trying to help.
</P>
<P>
"I looked around for another race, something that wouldn't conflict with the
Preakness, but I couldn't find anything," said McAnally, who trains Bayakoa.
</P>
<P>
So Bayakoa will run Saturday in the Hawthorne Handicap at Hollywood Park with
Pincay aboard. Houston will undergo a switch in jockeys, from Pincay to Angel
Cordero, for the 114th Preakness at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
That is not exactly a vote a confidence for Houston, Pincay opting for a minor
stake in California when he has the chance to ride a speed horse -- the kind
that occasionally steals off and wins the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Bayakoa is no ordinary mare. She might not be nationally known yet,
but the 5-year-old has beaten Goodbye Halo twice recently, by two lengths in
the Santa Margarita Handicap at Santa Anita and by four lengths in the Apple
Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
Houston, on the other hand, has beaten mediocre opponents in two races this
year, but in the stakes that really counted -- the Santa Anita Derby and the
Kentucky Derby -- he finished fifth and eighth, respectively, with Pincay
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Well after the fact, trainer Wayne Lukas blamed the heat at Santa Anita for
that loss. However, there was no such excuse in the Kentucky Derby, which was
run on a sub-50-degree day that was the coolest in the history of the race.
</P>
<P>
Pincay told Lukas after the Kentucky Derby that he thought Houston was a race
short of being able to run 1 1/4 miles. Since then, Houston, the Seattle
Slew-Smart Angle colt that cost Lukas $2.9 million as a yearling, has been
worked slowly at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
Lukas has won the Preakness before without working his horse at Pimlico, first
with Codex in 1980 and then with Tank's Prospect in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980 Preakness, Cordero rode his typical race aboard Codex. His colt
forced Genuine Risk, the filly who had won the Kentucky Derby, into the middle
of the track in the stretch before she lost by almost five lengths.
</P>
<P>
Cordero won his second Preakness aboard Gate Dancer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
McAnally, like Pincay, can't be in two places at the same time Saturday and
will be at Pimlico to saddle Hawkster in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
Hawkster hasn't won a race since he took the Norfolk as a 2-year-old last
October at Santa Anita, but he seems to have survived the hoof problem that
bothered him when he loosened a shoe in the Kentucky Derby. McAnally said that
Hawkster deserves a chance in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
In the Derby, Hawkster trailed by 15 lengths early, was closer to the
grandstand than the inner rail through the stretch and finished fifth, 3 1/4
lengths behind the victorious Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot of ground," McAnally said. "I think we lost enough to cost us
second place."
</P>
<P>
There's a $5-million bonus for the horse that sweeps the Triple Crown, and if
there's no Triple Crown champion, there's a $1-million bonus for the horse that
has the most points for first-, second- and third-place finishes in the Derby,
Preakness and Belmont.
</P>
<P>
A horse has to run in all three races to be eligible for the $1-million bonus.
With the chance for the extra money comes the danger that horses will be run in
the three races although they are not ready for the grind.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who owns 25% of Sunday Silence, is not the kind
who would fall into that trap. Whittingham needed to know from his private
veterinarian, Alex Harthill, whether Sunday Silence had recovered from his hoof
problem before he considered entering him today for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence apparently gave Harthill and Whittingham the assurance they
needed with strong gallops at Pimlico on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled workouts for both Sunday Silence and Hawkster were postponed
Wednesday until today because of a sloppy track. After 13 straight days of
rain, the sun came out and temperatures rose to the high 70s late Wednesday
afternoon. That weather is supposed to last through Saturday, meaning there
should be a fast track for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
When Sunday Silence's status was doubtful earlier this week, Whittingham was
asked about the bonus.
</P>
<P>
"What if he pulls the (starting) gate Saturday?" Whittingham said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
I visited Howard (Buddy) Jacobson in prison in Attica, N.Y., in January of
1988. Earlier this week, Jacobson, who was the country's leading trainer for
several years in the 1960s, died of cancer of the spine at the prison.
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, 58, was serving a sentence of 25 years to life for the 1978 murder of
a man in a notorious love-triangle case in New York.
</P>
<P>
Jacobson insisted that he was innocent. His lawyers were busy recently
preparing an appeal that was keyed to testimony from a witness who said she had
been afraid to appear at the first trial.
</P>
<P>
Jacobson appeared to be dying 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I can't move my head right or left much," he said then. "I'd like to look you
in the eye when we talk, and if you sit directly in front of me, I'll be able
to do that."
</P>
<P>
I tended to believe Jacobson. It was a complicated case and I had the feeling
that Jacobson, considering his poor health, wouldn't subject his family to a
costly appeal if he weren't innocent. Many of Jacobson's friends said that they
didn't know whether he had committed the murder or not.
</P>
<P>
Although owner Allen Paulson has won the Arlington Million with Estrapade and
the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf with Theatrical, he considers last Saturday's
victory in the $700,000 Pimlico Special with Blushing John his biggest.
</P>
<P>
Paulson bought Estrapade from Nelson Bunker Hunt after her career had already
begun and he owned Theatrical in a stormy partnership with Bert Firestone.
Blushing John has raced only for Paulson, since he bought the horse for
$850,000 as a yearling.
</P>
<P>
Blushing John needs Lasix -- the anti-bleeder diuretic -- to run effectively.
This will preclude his running in New York, where horses aren't allowed to run
on medication.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who is undefeated in six starts, runs in the 1 1/16-mile Gold
Rush Handicap on Saturday at Golden Gate Fields. Kept out of the Triple Crown
races because of a knee injury, the Hollywood Futurity winner made his
3-year-old debut at Golden Gate last month and won by 21 lengths against only
two opponents. . . . Sam Rubin, the New Yorker who raced John Henry, is looking
for a home someplace between Santa Anita and Del Mar. Rubin still has a few
horses with trainer Ron McAnally, who managed most of John Henry's career.
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors, winless since her victory in the Kentucky Derby last year, has
been unimpressive in two starts this year and her career is in jeopardy because
of respiratory problems. . . . Hal Ramser, vice president of the Oak Tree
Racing Assn. at Santa Anita and a horse owner and breeder, died at 81 on Monday
night at his Bel Air home. . . . Bill Shoemaker is riding at Pimlico today as
part of his farewell tour of American tracks.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas will start two horses each in the $250,000 Black-Eyed Susan
for 3-year-old fillies and the $150,000 Dixie Handicap for grass runners at
Pimlico on Friday. Imaginary Lady and Some Romance will run in the Black-Eyed
Susan at 1 1/8 miles, and Waki River and Dynaformer are entered in the Dixie at
1 1/2 miles. The Black-Eyed Susan has a field of nine and also drew Dreamy
Mimi, Seraglio, Tactile, Misty Ivor, Proper Miss, Noblest Heart and Moonlight
Martini. . . . Sixteen are entered in the Dixie, including Top Guest, Salem
Drive, Ten Keys, Dance Card Filled, Intensive Command, Master Speaker,
Castelets, Morewoods, Kadial, Couer De Lion, Free Colony, Ask Not, Jim Bowie
and Blue Nug. The last four horses listed are on the also-eligible list.

ALYDAR, RUNNER-UP IN RACING RIVALRY, HAS TO BE DESTROYED
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alydar was buried Thursday at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Ky., not far from the
grave markers of Whirlaway and Citation, only hours after he had to be
destroyed at the height of his breeding career.
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, Whirlaway and Citation were Calumet's Triple Crown champions,
sweeping a series that eluded Alydar in 1978 only because he came along in the
same year as Affirmed, who beat him by 1 1/2 lengths in the Kentucky Derby, by
a neck in the Preakness and by a head in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for our horse, Alydar would have been able to say, 'Move
over,
</P>
<P>
Secretariat,' " Patrice Wolfson said Thursday. Louis Wolfson and his wife
campaigned Affirmed, the 11th and most recent Triple Crown winner. Secretariat
swept the series in 1973.
</P>
<P>
A veterinarian gave Alydar a lethal injection Thursday morning. The 15-year-old
stallion had kicked his stall door at Calumet Tuesday night, breaking his right
hind leg above the ankle, and on Wednesday, with little hope for success,
surgeons worked two hours to repair the injury.
</P>
<P>
With a metal plate and five steel pins in his leg, Alydar was uncomfortable
with his cast and resisted his sling Thursday morning. He was tranquilized, and
15 minutes after the sling was removed, he slipped and fell, breaking the femur
bone in the upper part of the right hind leg.
</P>
<P>
"This is a heartbreaker," said J.T. Lundy, president of Calumet. "He was a game
horse all the way. He fought right to the end."
</P>
<P>
Alydar's loss is one of many in a year that may rank as racing's worst in terms
of deaths and injuries to important horses.
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand, 100 yards from a possible victory in the Breeders' Cup Distaff,
broke down and was destroyed at Belmont Park on Oct. 27, not long after a spill
that resulted in the deaths of two other horses.
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon, one of last year's best 2-year-olds, was destroyed this summer
after being stricken with an incurable hoof disease, and Sunday Silence, Easy
Goer and Criminal Type head a long list of talented horses that missed the
Breeders' Cup because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Two major stallions -- Fappiano and The Minstrel -- were destroyed on the same
day in September because of injury and illness.
</P>
<P>
Alydar, the sire of Easy Goer and Criminal Type, lost seven of 10 races to
Affirmed -- one of his victories, in the Travers at Saratoga, was the result of
a disqualification -- but in the breeding shed he surpassed his racing rival by
far. The leading stallion this year according to purses won, Alydar also sired
Alysheba, the 1988 horse of the year; and Turkoman, a divisional champion.
Alysheba won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic, and
Easy Goer the Belmont. This year, Criminal Type is a cinch divisional champion
and a strong candidate for horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
Affirmed never got going in stud, and a few years ago was moved from
Spendthrift Farm to Calumet, where he occupied a paddock next to Alydar's.
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera, Affirmed's trainer, visited both horses a few days before this
year's Kentucky Derby. Barrera, in Kentucky Wednesday for some horse sales, was
back at Santa Anita Thursday morning, when Wayne Lukas, Criminal Type's
trainer, told him of Alydar's death.
</P>
<P>
"I had heard Wednesday that Alydar was in bad shape," Barrera said. "When Wayne
told me, it broke my heart. Alydar gave me a lot of headaches, but he was a
great horse and this is a big tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"I'll never see another rivalry like Affirmed and Alydar in my lifetime. Their
races did so much for racing. They did more for racing than anything I've ever
seen."
</P>
<P>
Alydar, who was elected to the Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1989,
earned $957,195 and won 14 of 26 starts, including the Champagne as a
2-year-old and the Florida Derby, the Flamingo, the Blue Grass, the Travers and
the Whitney Handicap as a 3-year-old. He and Affirmed never met after the
Travers, Alydar's career quickly winding down after he suffered a training
injury in the fall of 1978.
</P>
<P>
"All of my memories of Alydar are great," said John Veitch, who trained the
colt. "Every time he ran, he never gave up."
</P>
<P>
After Affirmed and Alydar in the 1978 Triple Crown, there was no one else.
Alydar outdistanced the third-place finishers in the Derby, the Preakness and
the Belmont by 1 1/4, 7 1/2 and 13 lengths, becoming the only horse to run
second in all three races. Against horses other than Affirmed, Alydar won 11 of
16 starts.
</P>
<P>
"We just ran into another great horse," Alydar's jockey, Jorge Velasquez, said
at Hollywood Park Thursday. "Every time we'd get close to Affirmed, he kept
coming back. I'm not sure if we got ahead of him in the (stretch run of the)
Belmont. If we did, it was only by a half of a head, maybe. I'm very sad that
he died. This is terrible. It's a big loss for the industry."

SAN FELIPE HANDICAP;

<P>
SUNDAY SILENCE GIVES VALENZUELA A LIFT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela said he had stomach flu on Saturday, and was so sick that he
stayed home and passed up Santa Anita mounts on Lively One, a big winner in his
4-year-old debut, and Claire Marine, who ran third in a $150,000 race.
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing up all day and all night," Valenzuela said Sunday. "And if it
hadn't been for this horse, I wouldn't have been here today, either."
</P>
<P>
The horse that brought Valenzuela out of his sick bed was Sunday Silence, and
he's also the colt who might take the jockey and trainer Charlie Whittingham to
the Kentucky Derby. Sunday Silence is one race away -- the Santa Anita Derby on
April 8 -- from Churchill Downs after his 1 3/4-length win in Sunday's $159,300
San Felipe Handicap before a crowd of 38,428.
</P>
<P>
Before the San Felipe, Sunday Silence had never run in a stake, had never had
to make up six lengths on a horse in front of him and had never gone farther
than 6 1/2 furlongs.
</P>
<P>
The son of Halo and Wishing Well took the winner's share of $91,800 in the San
Felipe by effortlessly zipping past Yes I'm Blue on the turn for home and
running 1 1/16 miles in an unspectacular time of 1:42 3/5.
</P>
<P>
While Sunday Silence became a new presence on the national 3-year-old scene,
Music Merci took a backward step and cast additional doubts about his ability
to handle a distance of ground. All four of Music Merci's stakes wins have come
at a mile or less, and the 1-2 favorite finished third in the five- horse San
Felipe, 5 1/4 lengths behind Sunday Silence and 3 1/2 lengths behind Flying
Continental, who staged a mild stretch run to take second.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who has won both of his starts this year after winning two out
of three as a 2-year-old, was the second betting choice and paid $7.80, $3.80
and $2.20. Flying Continental paid $4 and $2.20 and Music Merci paid $2.10.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who carried 119 pounds, five less than Music Merci, almost went
to his knees leaving the gate, but was running right alongside the favorite
down the backstretch as Yes I'm Blue set fast fractions on a track that seemed
dull. The first half-mile mile was clocked in 45 1/5 seconds and six furlongs
went by in 1:09 1/5.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence left Music Merci on the turn for home, easily disposed of Yes
I'm Blue with a quarter-mile to run and was in no danger through the stretch.
</P>
<P>
With Easy Goer, the star from the East, everybody's favorite for the Kentucky
Derby, Whittingham was asked after the San Felipe where this victory put Sunday
Silence.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say we're among the top five or six horses now," said the trainer,
who won the Kentucky Derby with Ferdinand in 1986. "We'll probably go to
Kentucky with him after this, but the Santa Anita Derby will give us an even
better idea."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela has ridden Sunday Silence in all but one of his races.
</P>
<P>
"This is some kind of horse," he said. "The ground broke out from under him at
the start, and we were four lengths behind going into the first turn. I tried
to get him into the race without rushing him, hoping that he wouldn't run
three-quarters (of a mile) and quit.
</P>
<P>
"When I asked him at the quarter pole, he really picked it up. This is the best
3-year-old I've ever been on."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela hasn't been close with two Kentucky Derby mounts, and in 1980, when
as a 17-year-old he won the Santa Anita Derby with Codex, the horse was
inadvertently omitted as a nominee for Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence has been no sleeper, because in the third race of his career, at
Hollywood Park on Dec. 3, he almost beat Houston, another lightly raced colt
who's considered one of the Kentucky Derby contenders.
</P>
<P>
After starting horses in the Kentucky Derby in 1958 and 1960, Whittingham has
been back to Churchill Downs with horses three times in the 1980s, winning with
Ferdinand, finishing 12th with Lively One last year and scratching Temperate
Sil, the winner of the 1987 Santa Anita Derby, when he took ill a week before
the race.
</P>
<P>
"The Kentucky Derby can take a lot out of a horse, and I don't rush them unless
they show me they might be able to handle it," Whittingham said. "I've still
got six 3-year-olds that I haven't even run yet. I'd have to say, though, that
Sunday Silence is better at the same point in his career than Lively One and
Temperate Sil were."
</P>
<P>
Music Merci, who lugged in on jockey Gary Stevens midway through the stretch,
came to the San Felipe off a nine-length victory in the San Rafael three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
"I think this race was a combination of three things," Stevens said. "The
weight, his last race and the problems he had down the backstretch, when he was
getting all the dirt from the horse on the lead.
</P>
<P>
"When they run a race like the last one coming off a (two-month) layoff, it's
got to do something to them. I got within a length and a half of Sunday Silence
and thought it was going to be a horse race, then when we straightened out into
the stretch, I had no horse left.
</P>
<P>
"I still have confidence in him. If he threw in a clinker, I'm glad it was
today, and not the Derby."
</P>
<P>
Jay Robbins, who trains Flying Continental, was happy with his horse's race and
said he would run him in the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they'd run as fast early as they did today," Robbins said. "But
Charlie's horse was great, especially when you consider that it his first time
around two turns."
</P>
<P>
When Whittingham won his first Santa Anita Derby, with Temperate Sil, he had to
beat only five horses. There may not even be that many in the gate with Sunday

Trainer Craig Lewis, who finished third with Music Merci and last with Mountain
Ghost in the San Felipe Handicap, scratched Runaway Dunaway, his third entry in
the race. Runaway Dunaway will run next Sunday at Santa Anita and is a
candidate for the California Derby at Golden Gate Fields on April 22. As for
Music Merci, Lewis said: "We'll just have to appraise the situation and think
about it. I wasn't surprised that Yes I'm Blue set the pace he did, because I
figured he was a horse who was going to get to the lead at any cost."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's ownership is 50% for Arthur Hancock of Paris, Ky., and 25%
apiece for trainer Charlie Whittingham and Ernest Gaillard, a surgeon from La
Jolla. Hancock bought the horse privately, broke him at his Kentucky farm and
then sold half to Whittingham, who sold half of his interest to Gaillard. . . .
Houston, undefeated in two starts as a 2-year-old, worked five furlongs Sunday
morning at Santa Anita in a superb 58 4/5 seconds and will be flown to New York
Wednesday for his 3-year-old debut Saturday in the seven-furlong Bay Shore
Stakes at Aqueduct.

HOUSTON EXONERATED AFTER GOING TO TRIAL

Surrounded by a roomful of reporters, trainer Wayne Lukas watched on television
Saturday as Houston, his maligned 3-year-old colt, recovered from the Santa
Anita Derby disaster to win the one-mile Kentucky Derby Trial by five lengths
at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
Before the race, Lukas said he wasn't superstitious, but, still, he sat in the
same swivel chair in the track superintendent's office where he watched Winning
Colors last year as the filly gave him his first Kentucky Derby win.
</P>
<P>
In effect, the Trial was little more than a glorified workout for Houston, a
colt that cost Lukas $2.9 million as a yearling and then won his first three
races before beating only one horse as the heavy favorite in the Santa Anita
Derby three weeks ago. Houston defeated five horses of lesser skill in a good
time of 1:36 1/5 over a drying-out track that was called muddy most of the day
but was listed as good for the Trial.
</P>
<P>
Houston ran the last quarter-mile in :26 1/5 and did nothing in the stretch to
suggest that he will be a serious threat in next Saturday's 1 1/4-mile Kentucky
Derby. Nevertheless, Houston should be the fourth betting choice, behind the
entry of Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring, Santa Anita Derby winner Sunday Silence
and Western Playboy.
</P>
<P>
Belek, who had been undefeated in three starts, finished second, seven lengths
ahead of Affirmed's Image. In His Cups ran fourth, Pulverizing was fifth after
leading for a half-mile in a speedy time of :44 4/5 and One That Got Away
finished last.
</P>
<P>
Houston, earning $54,502 of the $83,850 purse, paid $3, $2.40 and $2.40. Belek
paid $2.60 and $2.60, and Affirmed's Image paid $3.40. The temperature was
about 75 degrees, but the humidity reminded Lukas of the Santa Anita Derby, in
which Houston wilted in the heat.
</P>
<P>
Neither Lukas nor jockey Laffit Pincay did flip-flops over Houston's race.
Houston went to the track calmly before an opening-day crowd of 24,281. The
well-bred son of Seattle Slew and Smart Angle broke well and settled into
second place, a couple lengths behind Pulverizing, as the field left the chute
for the run down the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
Houston ranged up on the outside to take the lead away from Pulverizing on the
turn and won easily. Pincay did not need to use the whip.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the best work on the tab," Lukas kiddingly said. "I would have
preferred that he run it a little slower, but it's better for a horse to run
fluidly than have him go slower.
</P>
<P>
"I told Laffit to get him off the fence coming through the stretch and he did.
The track was a little sticky on the inside. This race was more of a challenge
than the other horses he beat. It gives him a race over the (Derby) track,
we've got the horse back (from the Santa Anita defeat) and if he bounced back
from this, then we'll move on to the Derby.
</P>
<P>
"Whether he wins the Derby or not, this is a good horse and he'll have a good
career. It's a lot of fun to speculate on who is doing what, but the Derby
isn't a mythical championship, it's a dogfight on the race track."
</P>
<P>
Bob French, Lukas' long-time partner from Midland, Tex., who bought a
controlling interest in Houston after the trainer got him at a Keeneland
auction, was relieved that the colt won.
</P>
<P>
"The Santa Anita Derby knocked the wind out of us," French said. "This was very
nice, it was exactly what we wanted. What happened at Santa Anita really got to
us."
</P>
<P>
Five of the winners of the Trial came back to win the Derby, but none since Tim
Tam in 1958, when the race was only seven furlongs. Since 1982, when the Trial
was moved from four days before the Derby to a week ahead, no horse has come
out of the race to win the Derby. "I just sat with my horse most of the way,"
Pincay said. "We were just waiting. I wasn't worried about the speed horse
(Pulverizing), I wasn't worried about him at all. I'm satisfied with this
race."
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, the 115th Derby figured to have one of the smaller
fields in recent years, but now there's going to be the usual mob. A field of
15 is definite, and if Flying Continental comes from California, there could be
16. Jack Robbins, one of owner Jack Kent Cooke's advisers, said that there's a
60-40 chance that Flying Continental will run.
</P>
<P>
Besides Easy Goer, Awe Inspiring, Sunday Silence, Western Playboy and Houston,
the field should include Dansil, Triple Buck, Faultless Ensign, Hawkster,
Clever Trevor, Notation, Majesty's Imp, Irish Actor, Northern Wolf and Wind
Splitter.
</P>
<P>
Majesty's Imp joined the group Saturday, even though he finished fifth last
Tuesday in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. His principal owner, Chuck
Tanner, managed the Pittsburgh Pirates to a World Series victory, but he is new
to the horse racing business and has never been to the Derby. He can get a
better seat with a horse in the race.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer worked quickly Saturday morning, running five furlongs in :59.
Although the track was muddy, trainer Shug McGaughey said that it was easier
for Easy Goer to grip than it was when he ran second in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Churchill Downs last November. . . . Sunday Silence worked a mile
in 1:39 3/5 and trainer Charlie Whittingham said: "The track was a little
tiring and he probably had 125 pounds (exercise rider Steve Bass and a heavy
saddle), but he came out of it and wasn't even blowing." . . . Hawkster worked
a mile in 1:41 1/5 with Marco Castaneda, who will be his rider in the Derby, in
the saddle for the first time. . . . Dansil's owner, John Franks, is
considering a jockey change for the Derby, even though Larry Snyder rode the
colt to victory in the Arkansas Derby.

SUNDAY SILENCE TO UNDERGO SURGERY FOR SMALL BONE CHIP
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday Silence, whose recent victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic more than
likely clinched the 1989 horse of the year title, will undergo surgery Thursday
for the removal of a bone chip in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
The 40-minute procedure will be performed at the Hollywood Park Equine Clinic
by Dr. Greg Ferraro. The prognosis is for a full recovery, and for Sunday
Silence to be able to return to competition in about five months.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham had little doubt that Sunday Silence suffered the
injury in defeating archrival Easy Goer by a neck in the Nov. 4 Classic.
</P>
<P>
"We know he didn't have it going into the race, and yet the chip is so small it
didn't show until we'd galloped him two or three days after he got home,"
Whittingham said.
</P>
<P>
Ferraro described the injury as nothing out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
"If he had to have a chip, this is the best kind to have," the veterinarian
said. "Unless something else is found, this type of chip has the best
prognosis."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who also owns 25% of Sunday Silence, is likewise optimistic that
his champion 3-year-old colt will come back to the races next year as good as
ever.
</P>
<P>
Besides his victory in the Classic, Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby, the
Preakness, the Santa Anita Derby and a record $4,578,454 in 1989. He ranks
third in all-time earnings behind Alysheba and John Henry.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock of Lexington, Ky., owns 50% of Sunday Silence and Dr. Ernest
Gaillard of La Jolla owns the other 25%. Reached at his Stone Farm on Monday,
Hancock said he briefly considered retiring the colt to stud.
</P>
<P>
"From what Charlie told me, though, he'll come back 100%," Hancock said.
"Anyway, I think 4 is a little too young to send a horse to stud. They don't
really mature as a racehorse until they get to be 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes all right, I'd like Sunday Silence to have a shot at
winning the Classic again next year," Hancock said. "Maybe even get the
earnings record. Racing needs stars, and he's certainly a popular horse."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said he detected heat in Sunday Silence's knee late last week, a
few days after the colt's return to Santa Anita from his victory over Easy Goer
in the Classic at Gulfstream Park. Ferraro said that X-rays revealed a chip
about the size of the nail on an adult's index finger.
</P>
<P>
"It is located above the joint, and not on a weight-bearing surface," Ferraro
said. "That's why a horse can recover quickly and be able to run very well."
</P>
<P>
Said Whittingham: "I've had many horses come back better than ever from that
kind of injury. We took a chip out of Balzac's knee and look what he went on to
do."
</P>
<P>
As a 3-year-old in 1978, Elizabeth Keck's Balzac injured his knee while
finishing second to Affirmed in the Santa Anita Derby. He returned for
Whittingham the next year, won the Oak Tree Invitational and earned nearly half
a million dollars after his operation.
</P>
<P>
Spend a Buck was another high-profile thoroughbred who bounced back after knee
surgery for removal of a bone chip. He had that surgery in November of his
2-year-old season, then returned in the spring of 1985 and won the Kentucky
Derby and, eventually, was voted horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
"There's some people who would go ahead and train a horse with a chip still in
there," Whittingham said. "You can get away with it, but sometimes the chip
gets to grinding away at the cartilage, and you end up with worse damage. Just
as well to get it out of there and start fresh."
</P>
<P>
Plans originally called for Sunday Silence to get a brief vacation and be
pointed for the San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita in mid-January. The injury
will deprive him of a chance to run in the $500,000 Strub Stakes in February
and the $1,000,000 Santa Anita Handicap in March.
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't break my heart," Whittingham said. "If he wins a lot early in the
year, he ends up carrying too much weight in handicaps later on. Anyway, he's
still growing. A little extra time off will do him a world of good."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence was shipped from Santa Anita to Hollywood Park early Tuesday
morning with the rest of Whittingham's stable. The colt will remain at the
track during his recovery, and if all goes well, Whittingham said, Sunday
Silence could go back into training in about three months.

SHUG MCGAUGHEY, TRAINER OF WOOD AND KENTUCKY DERBY FAVORITE, SMILES A LOT

<P>
Shug McGaughey was in a surprisingly good mood at his Belmont Park barn
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure, McGaughey should be chipper, since he trains Easy Goer, the heavy
favorite in Saturday's $500,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and the odds-on
favorite for the Kentucky Derby, which will be run at Churchill Downs May 6.
</P>
<P>
But a trainer is never devoid of worries, and even a trainer with a horse as
fast as Easy Goer can frown some. Cases in point, as far as McGaughey is
concerned:
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Jane McGaughey, the trainer's wife and Easy Goer's exercise rider
until she became too great with child, is scheduled to deliver their second
baby in late May.
</P>
<P>
 -- Seeking the Gold, a top 3-year-old last year and a horse expected to be one
of the country's best handicap runners this year, jammed his ankle in Florida
last month, just about the time he was going to make his 1989 debut.
</P>
<P>
 -- Grand Gala, a talented 3-year-old filly who was being pointed for the
Kentucky Oaks, the day before the Derby, hurt a knee while running at Keeneland
recently and underwent arthroscopic surgery for removal of a bone chip Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
 -- Easy Goer, in his final workout before the Wood, breezed a half-mile
Thursday at Belmont in :46 1/5, which was two or three seconds faster than
McGaughey wanted.
</P>
<P>
Still, McGaughey was smiling at an early hour in his barn office. The
opposition in the Wood is so nondescript that McGaughey's colt should be able
to spot the others an extra-quick workout and still thrash them. The best of
Easy Goer's five rivals may be Diamond Donnie, and he ran second, 13 lengths
behind Easy Goer, at Aqueduct two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/8-mile Wood will be only the second time around two turns for Easy Goer
-- he was second, after a bad start in the mud, in the 1 1/16-mile Breeders'
Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs last November -- but McGaughey does not believe
that this will be a factor. Neither does Aqueduct's track handicapper, who has
made the son of Alydar a 1-9 favorite.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, McGaughey chastised David Carroll, Easy Goer's current
exercise rider, when the trainer thought the colt had worked too fast at
Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing the best I can but I just can't hold him," Carroll told McGaughey.
</P>
<P>
So when Easy Goer and Carroll went considerably faster than McGaughey's
expectations Thursday, the trainer accepted the workout calmly. "He was still
running well within himself," McGaughey said. "A good horse like this one just
runs that fast, that's all."
</P>
<P>
It was a morning that called for Barbra Streisand -- one of those rare New York
days so clear that you could see forever. Outside the barn after the workout,
Mary Jane McGaughey, dressed in jeans and a floppy T-shirt that advertised her
condition, held Easy Goer's lead shank while a groom hosed the horse's ankles
in a bright spring sunshine that made the colt's butterscotch coat glisten.
</P>
<P>
A battalion of photographers shot the horse from every angle, as they might a
model in a swimsuit, and Easy Goer just stood there with his handlers,
impervious to the commotion.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's coat is not as bright as the near-red appearance of Secretariat,
the 1973 Triple Crown champion with whom McGaughey's horse has been frequently
compared. But just standing still, Easy Goer is a stunning animal. He has what
horsemen generically call a star in the middle of his forehead, although the
white marking could pass for a catawampus triangle. If McGaughey were given a
Rorschach test with the same pattern, he might say that it resembles a map of
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey mentioned Secretariat. "I know Secretariat got beat in the Wood but
that's the reason a horse wins and pays $100 sometimes," he said. "But I sure
don't expect this horse to lose Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Nor does he expect Easy Goer to lose at Churchill Downs two weeks from now.
Easy Goer has run eight times, losing twice, and one of the defeats was at the
Louisville track, but he still was a fast-closing second to Is It True that day
and McGaughey has dismissed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's other defeat was in the first race of his career, going six
furlongs at Belmont last August, when he also broke slowly and came from behind
but lost by a nose to a 2-year-old who wasn't even nominated for this year's
Triple Crown races. Is It True was injured in his Breeders' Cup win over Easy
Goer and only recently returned to the races.
</P>
<P>
In his second start, Easy Goer was a winner at Saratoga -- his first of three
victories over the same Is It True -- and McGaughey thought there was something
wrong with the track timer when it showed 1:22 3/5 for seven furlongs. Three
weeks later, however, when Easy Goer ran a 6 1/2-furlong race back at Belmont
in a sparkling 1:15 2/5, McGaughey knew that the Saratoga clock didn't need to
be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Moving into stakes competition, Easy Goer romped in the Cowdin and Champagne at
Belmont before his 2-year-old season ended with the 1 1/4-length defeat in the
Breeders' Cup. He still won the Eclipse Award as the year's best 2-year-old
colt. Easy Goer has won his six races by a total of 36 3/4 lengths.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey, 38, trains for the Phipps family -- Ogden and his son, Dinny -- and
he went to Florida with Easy Goer and the rest of their horses for the winter.
The plan was to race Easy Goer lightly, skipping the Florida Derby and the
Flamingo, Florida's two major preps for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer raced on Florida Derby day at Gulfstream, but it was in the
seven-furlong Swale Stakes, and he won easily, being clocked in 1:22 1/5. Then
Easy Goer was shipped North and he blew their doors off in the Gotham on April
8, running the mile in 1:32 2/5, which missed breaking Dr. Fager's 21-year-old
world record by a fifth of a second.

Trainer John Sadler was in the Breeders' Cup limelight last year with Olympic
Prospect, a top contender in the Sprint. The big chestnut gelding ended up
finishing seventh on a muddy track he did not like, about four lengths behind
Gulch.
</P>
<P>
A year later, the same horse and same trainer are back for a second try, yet
they have spent most mornings this week in virtual anonymity, stabled in an
almost empty barn in the far corner of the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind at all," Sadler said Friday. "Last year he deserved the
attention. This year, let's face it, he's a longshot.
</P>
<P>
"I just hope they ignore him for the first eighth of a mile," the trainer
added. "If they let him go early . . . Well, let's just say there may be a
pleasant surprise."
</P>
<P>
With only two starts this year -- one impressive win and one dismal loss --
Olympic Prospect presents a difficult handicapping challenge. Sadler, however,
said the key to his chances may be the lack of racing.
</P>
<P>
"Last year I might have pushed him a little hard," the trainer said. "He's
always run best when fresh off a layoff, like right now."
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham will get a police escort to and from the race track today.
Highway patrolman Lester Marder has volunteered his services this week to the
Sunday Silence camp, and he wants to make sure everything goes smoothly for
Whittingham on the big day.
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing this on my own time," Marder said as he watched Sunday Silence in
the paddock Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody bothers these people or gets near the horse, I ask them politely to
stop. I have to ask a second time, they go for a ride in my car."
</P>
<P>
For his unusual moonlighting, Marder will be getting a photograph of him
feeding Sunday Silence a carrot.
</P>
<P>
"Hey, just being around this horse is a once-in-a-lifetime thing," Marder
added. "I haven't been to a Kentucky Derby yet, but spending time with a Derby
winner is the next best thing."
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer was the early 1-5 favorite for the Classic, and Sunday Silence was
second choice at 7-2.
</P>
<P>
Other early favorites include Caltech in the Turf at 4-1, the entry of Rhythm
and Adjudicating in the Juvenile at 7-2, Steinlen in the Mile at 2-1, Bayakoa
in the Distaff at 3-2, Trumpets Blare in the Juvenile Fillies at 2-1 and Mr.
Nickerson in the Sprint at 7-2.
</P>
<P>
Among the obvious early overlays were On the Line, 8-1 in the Sprint; Ile de
Chypre in the Turf at 22-1, and Present Value at 70-1 in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Chris McCarron was asked if he had any advice for Kent Desormeaux, the
Maryland-based rider who has dead aim on McCarron's single-season mark of 546
victories.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I could tell him would be: 'Don't stop,' " McCarron replied.
"When he hits 546 -- and I'm certain he will -- he should run it up as high as
he can."
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux got his 503rd winner of the year when he rode Nefario Cable, at odds
of nearly 103-1, to victory Friday at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer, was being pumped for the umpteenth time by
a network television staffer looking for an interview angle.
</P>
<P>
"What hasn't been touched on that you'd like to tell people about the horse?"
she asked.
</P>
<P>
"At this point I have no idea," McGaughey said. "But for goodness sakes, don't
ask me 'How's he doing?' And please don't ask what kind of personality he's
got."
</P>
<P>
Sabona, one of two horses in the Breeders' Cup Mile for trainer Neil Drysdale,
will be running for a different owner today. A half interest in the son of
Exclusive Native was sold this week to William O. Reed of Mare Haven Farm in
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Sabona, a 21-1 shot in early Breeders' Cup betting, will run in the names of
Sir Ernest Harrison and Mrs. Audrey Reed.

Sunday Silence, who earned 1989 Horse of the Year honors after three stirring
victories over Easy Goer, was retired today because of a strained ligament in
his left front foot.
</P>
<P>
"He's the best horse I've had in my lifetime, and I've had a lot of good ones,"
said Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence's trainer and co-owner with Arthur
Hancock. "It's not a very bad problem, but with a horse of his caliber, you
don't want to take a chance. He's done everything he can and we're going to let
him retire in a dignified way."
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence had been training for Saturday's Arlington Challenge Cup at
Arlington Park when the injury occurred. The injury was diagnosed by Dr. Alex
Harthill, who today detected "heat" in the foot of the 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said there was no swelling in the leg and the horse is not lame.
Sunday Silence will stand stud at Stone Farm in Paris, Ky., across the street
from where rival Easy Goer is standing stud.
</P>
<P>
"They'll be able to shoot the bull for the rest of their lives," Whittingham
said. "We'll get him to Kentucky in a few days.
</P>
<P>
"I have a special feeling for Sunday Silence. He's got a great personality.
There's not a bad race in his pedigree."
</P>
<P>
With the loss of Sunday Silence, the Challenge Cup suffered another blow to
what once was a stellar field. After the news of Sunday Silence hit, trainer D.
Wayne Lukas, who last month withdrew Criminal Type from the event after Easy
Goer was retired, said today he was withdrawing 1989 male grass champion
Steinlen. Also today, Opening Verse was removed from the field because of a
minor foot injury.
</P>
<P>
The field for the Challenge Cup now stands at three -- Western Playboy, Beau
Genius and Santangelo -- with the purse having been further reduced to
$250,000. The original purse was $1 million, but when Easy Goer was retired, it
dropped to $600,000.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence retires as the third-leading money winner of all time, with
$4,968,554, behind Alysheba and John Henry. Sunday Silence won nine of 14
career starts and finished second in the five other races.
</P>
<P>
This year, Sunday Silence raced twice, winning the Californian Stakes on June 3
at Hollywood Park and finishing second to Criminal Type in the Hollywood Gold
Cup on June 24.
</P>
<P>
His retirement follows the departure of Easy Goer, who retired July 18 because
of bone chip to the right front sesamoid. The two were to meet for the first
time as 4-year-olds in the Arlington Cup Challenge.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence will best be remembered for his thrilling battles with Easy Goer
in the 1989 Triple Crown races. Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness before Easy Goer took the Belmont to spoil Sunday Silence's Triple
Crown hopes. But Sunday Silence avenged that defeat in the Breeders' Cup
Classic at Gulfstream in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's been one bummer after another lately for the good burghers of this Ohio
River town.
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, the Derby Balloon Race was canceled because of high winds.
One entrant had driven here all the way from Utah.
</P>
<P>
Next, the $2.9-million Louisville Falls Fountain, the lighted river attraction
advertised as the world's largest floating fountain, was knocked out of
commission when underwater debris clogged its pipes.
</P>
<P>
In the Derby Steamboat Race, the Louisville Belle was beaten badly by the
invader, Delta Queen. There was no exacta betting.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, the Pegasus Parade, a Derby tradition, was held in a steady
rain.
</P>
<P>
But today is Kentucky Derby day, No. 115 in the series, and the residents are
determined to turn things around for the 125,000 or so -- most of them visitors
-- who will cram historic, gussied-up Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer wins, many of them will go home singing into their mint juleps,
because most of the money will be bet on that brilliant 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer has won seven of his nine races and is being described as the best
candidate to sweep the Triple Crown since Spectacular Bid won the 1979 Derby.
Spectacular Bid also won the Preakness, then finished third in the Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
This Derby is being called a two-horse race, despite the presence of 14 other
3-year-olds. Support has built in recent weeks for Sunday Silence, the Santa
Anita Derby winner who came here as a good horse and seems to have trained into
a better one.
</P>
<P>
He and Easy Goer have never run against one another, though, so there is no way
to gauge them. Easy Goer has won three straight races as a 3-year-old and was
never really pressed in any of them. Sunday Silence also has won all three of
his races this year and overall is four for six, with two second-place
finishes.
</P>
<P>
Another $2.9-million attraction -- Houston -- figures to be a factor in the 1
1/4-mile Derby, and although he was soundly beaten by Sunday Silence at Santa
Anita, trainer Wayne Lukas is typically confident.
</P>
<P>
One thing certain about Houston, he will be in front for much of the race. Even
though there are other speed horses in the field, they are what's known on the
backstretch as cheap speed. After their initial bursts, they run out of gas,
and heaven help a horse and jockey running close behind a horse that stops in
the Derby. They don't just slow down, they almost come to a full stop.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham, the wily trainer who won the Derby with longshot Ferdinand
in 1986, gives Easy Goer his due, but Whittingham believes that his horse --
Sunday Silence -- has faced stronger opposition in California than Easy Goer
has encountered in New York.
</P>
<P>
That's precisely the reason why Ben Perkins Sr. and his trainer son are here
with Faultless Ensign, who is 50-1 in the morning line. Easy Goer and his
entrymate, Awe Inspiring, were 3-5 before Friday's advance Derby betting began,
but at the end of the day the entry was listed at even money. Sunday Silence is
the 3-1 second choice based on Friday's betting, and the entry of Houston and
Shy Tom is next at 7-2.
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer deserves the respect he's gotten but he hasn't beaten a good horse
yet," Perkins said. "He's got his work cut out for him. I know Sunday Silence
is a good horse, and Lukas can't be that wrong about Houston."
</P>
<P>
A strong possibility is Houston establishing an early lead while posting quick
fractions, with Sunday Silence staying close to his pace and Easy Goer lurking
not far behind the first two. How far Easy Goer trails early will probably be
up to his jockey, Pat Day. In winning the Wood Memorial two weeks ago, the son
of Alydar showed that he has a nice early lick, too.
</P>
<P>
The weatherman keeps changing his mind, but if the latest forecast is correct,
Churchill Downs might have its first off track for the Derby since Dust
Commander won in the mud here in 1970. It rained Thursday and Friday, and
there's a 40% chance for more rain this morning and this afternoon. The
temperature probably won't get above 55.
</P>
<P>
It could be a day not unlike the Breeders' Cup last November, when Easy Goer
suffered one of his two defeats, losing to Is It True by 1 1/4 lengths in the
mud at 1 1/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
Day didn't like his ride that day, and Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer,
didn't like the track.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of muddy tracks here but never one like that day," McGaughey
said. "Usually, this is a good track, even when it rains. They didn't harrow
the track that day, and it made a difference. I don't think they'll make the
same mistake again, and this colt should handle it better if it's off."
</P>
<P>
A son of Halo, Sunday Silence is considered a good off-track horse. He won
comfortably on a sloppy track at Santa Anita in March.
</P>
<P>
After the big two and Houston, the field is heavy with horses whose trainers
were brought here kicking and screaming by their owners. Dansil, Wind Splitter,
Notation, Flying Continental, Irish Actor and even Awe Inspiring, McGaughey's
other starter, are in that category.
</P>
<P>
It has been written that Hawkster also qualifies for that group, but his owner,
Shelly Meredith, bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
"Ron McAnally (Hawkster's trainer) had only one reservation about coming,"
Meredith said. "He told me how expensive it would be to come here, but as far
as I was concerned, that could never be a consideration as long as you felt
that you had a horse who belonged."
</P>
<P>
Jim Murphy, the trainer who went until only a couple of days ago before he
found a jockey -- Herb McCauley -- for Notation, was hardly diplomatic in
indicating his feelings.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a jockey yet," Murphy said before he had hired McCauley. "The
owners are the ones who want to run, let them get out of it."
</P>
<P>
Finishing second, third or fourth today might not make expenses. The winner
gets $584,200 of the $759,200 pot, but payoffs for the other top finishers drop
to $100,000, $50,000 and $25,000, respectively.

REVERSE OF FINISH IN DERBY WOULD RUIN BONUS PLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
A Summer Squall-Unbridled 1-2 finish in Saturday's Preakness might balance the
Triple Crown rivalry between the colts, but it would do nothing for the series'
$1-million bonus and turn the Belmont Stakes into an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
Triple Crown sponsors and officials are supposed to be neutral, but privately
they are hoping that the Preakness result doesn't turn out to be Summer Squall
first and Unbridled second, which would be a reversal of their positions in the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
There's a $5-million payoff for the owners of any horse that wins the Triple
Crown, but short of that, there's a $1-million bonus for the horse that runs in
all three races and accumulates the most points based on a system that gives
five points for a first place, three for a second and one for a third.
</P>
<P>
If Summer Squall ran first at Pimlico Saturday and Unbridled finished second,
each horse would have eight points. But since Cot Campbell, manager of the
28-member syndicate that owns Summer Squall, has already announced that the
colt will be skipping the Belmont on June 9, Unbridled would win the $1 million
no matter where he finished in the third race.
</P>
<P>
The $1 million has been in doubt before every Belmont since the bonus system
started in 1987. Last year, Easy Goer, despite finishing second to Sunday
Silence in both the Derby and the Preakness, still could have earned the $1
million if (1) he won the Belmont and (2) Sunday Silence finished off the
board. Easy Goer did win the Belmont, but Sunday Silence clinched the bonus by
placing second.
</P>
<P>
Going into the 1988 Belmont, Winning Colors, winner of the Derby and third in
the Preakness, was tied, 6-6, with Risen Star, who was third in the Derby
before winning the Preakness. Risen Star's owners received the $1 million when
he romped home in the Belmont. Winning Colors finished last.
</P>
<P>
The $1-million bonus, as well as the $5-million Triple Crown payoff, slipped
away from Alysheba in 1987 after he won the Derby and the Preakness. Bet Twice,
second in both of the first two races, won the Belmont to finish with 11
points, as Alysheba missed third place in the Belmont by a neck and totaled 10.
</P>
<P>
"Summer Squall winning and Unbridled running second in the Preakness would not
be the ideal finish for us," said Ed Seigenfeld, executive director of Triple
Crown Productions. "But that's only providing that Summer Squall doesn't run in
the Belmont. I'm not so sure, with 28 owners to consider, that Cot Campbell
wouldn't think again about running in the Belmont if the $1 million was at
stake."
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who made the Belmont decision last week after consulting with his
trainer, Neil Howard, did not say that it is flexible. Campbell has not yet
arrived in Baltimore, but at Pimlico Tuesday, after Summer Squall worked five
furlongs in an excellent :59 4/5, Howard didn't sound like a trainer who was
still considering the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
"We threw out the Belmont because of the Lasix thing -- that was the first
thing we said -- and because it wouldn't be fair to the horse, who's had a
tough schedule," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who bled from the lungs during a workout at Gulfstream Park
before he made his first start as a 3-year-old, has two victories and two
seconds in four races this year, running each time while being treated with
Lasix, a diuretic frequently given to bleeders. In New York, however, racing
with medication is forbidden, and Summer Squall could not be treated with Lasix
before the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
Because of the bleeding, Summer Squall missed some training and didn't make his
first start this year until March 17. The Preakness will be the fourth tough
race for the lightly built colt in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The horse has been better to us than we have been to him," Howard said. "If we
ran in the Belmont and won, they'd be saying we were geniuses. But if I had to
go out to the eighth pole to pick up my horse that day, well, you can imagine
what the (New York) Daily News would do with that."
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Triple Crown bonus is to encourage owners of the Kentucky
Derby horses to come back for the Preakness and the Belmont. This year,
however, only five horses from the Derby -- Unbridled (first), Summer Squall
(second), Pleasant Tap (third), Land Rush (seventh) and Mister Frisky (eighth)
-- are running in the Preakness, the smallest field since the bonus started.
Six Derby horses returned in the 1987 Preakness; there were seven in '88, and
six came back last year.
</P>
<P>
Unbridled's powerful stretch run in the Derby and his 3 1/2-length victory over
Summer Squall doubtless contributed to the absence of several Derby horses from
Pimlico. Even Howard is hard-pressed to suggest ways to turn the tables
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I carried Unbridled's silks (as a favor to trainer Carl Nafzger) in my
suitcase when I came here from Kentucky," Howard said. "I thought about not
turning them in (to Pimlico)."
</P>
<P>
An imaginative scheme, but Howard knows, of course, that missing silks wouldn't
stop Unbridled from running. Most tracks carry a set of plain silks in the
event an owner's regular set isn't available.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Unbridled finished his preparations for the Preakness at Churchill Downs on
Tuesday, working five furlongs in 1:00 2/5. Trainer Carl Nafzger said the colt
is "right on schedule." Unbridled is due at Pimlico about noon today. . . . The
fastest workout Tuesday at Pimlico was Pleasant Tap's :57 3/5. Trainer Chris
Speckert said the work was much faster than he wanted but didn't think it would
hurt Pleasant Tap's chances.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, who hasn't raced since he lost to Sunday Silence in the Breeders'
Cup Classic last November, will face five horses today in the seven-furlong
Gold Stage Stakes at Belmont Park. The race is supposed to be a prep for Easy
Goer, who is scheduled to face Housebuster on May 28 in the Metropolitan Mile.
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter, 92, the owner of Unbridled, is not expected to make the trip
from Bloomington, Minn., to Baltimore for the Preakness. Genter is worn out
from going to Louisville to see her colt win the Derby.

MAGICAL MILE SEEKS TO PROVE DEBUT WAS NO ILLUSION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Magical Mile was running in New York instead of at Hollywood Park, he might
be described by now as the second coming of Devil's Bag, Easy Goer or even
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers go overboard on horses much more than Californians do. There might
have been more written about Devil's Bag as a 2-year-old than there was about
Secretariat in his entire career. Devil's Bag was scratched from the Kentucky
Derby and never ran again.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer has gotten the same treatment during his brief career, which is why
some Eastern journalists were so relieved when the colt redeemed himself by
winning the Belmont after Sunday Silence beat him in both the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
In California, the tendency is to let the top horses establish themselves on
the track before enshrining them in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile has run only one time, and although he shattered Hollywood Park's
track record by covering five furlongs in :56 2/5, all that's being said about
trainer Warren Stute's colt so far is that he appears to be the best 2-year-old
on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile will run Saturday in the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile at six
furlongs.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye, who has never won the stake, has nevertheless ridden some
outstanding 2-year-olds, including Roving Boy and Gato Del Sol. Delahoussaye
won the Kentucky Derby back to back with Gato Del Sol and Sunny's Halo in
1982-83.
</P>
<P>
"This colt (Magical Mile) is one of the best 2-year-olds I've ever been on,"
Delahoussaye said. "Of course, you can't go by just one race, because you've
got to wait and see if they can stretch out, but the potential with this one is
there. For one thing, he's mature for a young horse. He's not that green. He
reminds you of an older horse."
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile suffered a minor leg cut in his debut and missed two weeks of
training, then Stute couldn't find a race to use as a prep for the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
"This will be his first race in two months, and you have to be concerned about
that," Delahoussaye said. "But he's been working good and I won't trade my
chances with anybody. There'll be some other horses running Saturday who'll be
in the same situation."
</P>
<P>
There will be either a small field or a large group running in the $500,000
Haskell Handicap at Monmouth Park a week from Saturday, depending on whether
Easy Goer runs. Trainer Shug McGaughey is expected to make the decision on Easy
Goer today, with the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga on Aug. 5 being his other
option.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer and Sunday Silence were weighted at 126 pounds for the Haskell, but
Sunday Silence is staying at Hollywood Park to run in the $400,000 Swaps on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, winner of the Ohio Derby and beaten only once in his career,
worked six furlongs at Monmouth Wednesday in a good 1:12 4/5. King Glorious has
been assigned 123 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Another probable for the 1 1/8-mile Haskell is Music Merci at 120 pounds, but
he would have to be flown to New Jersey from Los Angeles. It seems that the
only definite starter besides King Glorious is Le Voyageur (114 pounds), the
French-raced colt who made his American debut by leading the Belmont for a mile
before finishing third, eighth lengths behind Easy Goer but only a length
behind Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
Only four horses -- Endow, Notorious Pleasure, Prized and Raise a Stanza -- are
expected to challenge Sunday Silence in the Swaps.
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker has won the Sunset Handicap 13 times, never with a distaffer,
but he will get that chance Friday night at Hollywood Park when he rides No
Review in the $250,000 race. In her last start, No Review finished third in the
Beverly Hills Handicap for fillies and mares on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, who will turn 58 on Aug. 19, is retiring early next year and will be
honored Friday during a special evening program at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker rode in his first Sunset in 1949 and overall he has missed only four
runnings of the stake since then. Besides the 13 victories, he has finished
second four times and third three times.
</P>
<P>
Seven horses are entered in the Sunset, including Frankly Perfect, who will be
favored to give trainer Charlie Whittingham his 11th victory in the stake. Six
of Whittingham's victories have come with Shoemaker in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
Friday night's lineup, with jockeys and weights:
</P>
<P>
Desert Crest, Chris McCarron, 114 pounds; Pranke, Pat Valenzuela, 117; Putting,
Gary Stevens, 114; Frankly Perfect, Eddie Delahoussaye, 123; No Review,
Shoemaker, 110; Pleasant Variety, Laffit Pincay, 114; and Miserden, Robbie
Davis, 108.
</P>
<P>
Present Value, the 5-year-old who won the Michigan Mile and One-Eighth at 49-1
last Saturday at Detroit Race Course, could be the answer to a Shoemaker trivia
question.
</P>
<P>
Unless Shoemaker wins a stake during his farewell tour, which is scheduled to
end at Santa Anita next Feb. 4, Present Value will be remembered as his last
stake winner in the United States. Shoemaker rode Present Value to a 1
1/4-length victory in the National Jockey Club Stakes on May 6 at Sportsman's
Park, the first time he ever rode at the Chicago area track.
</P>
<P>
With a price of $300,000, it was with some reluctance that trainer Ron McAnally
approved the sale of Bayakoa, and now the Argentine mare has won five straight
stakes.
</P>
<P>
"I thought $300,000 was too much," McAnally said, "but then I heard that they
paid $500,000 for Rosadora, which made the price of our mare sound better."
</P>
<P>
Rosadora finished fourth, far back of Bayakoa, in last Saturday's Vanity
Handicap at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
Rahy, winner of the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park last Sunday, was the
third highest-priced yearling to be auctioned in the country in 1986 when the
son of Blushing Groom sold for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
Whenever a horse flirts with Dr. Fager's record for the mile, as Rahy did when
he won the Bel Air in 1:33 last Sunday, John Nerud reminds that Dr. Fager's
1:32 1/5 came while carrying 134 pounds at Arlington Park in 1968. Rahy carried
117 pounds in the Bel Air.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1968, Nerud brought Dr. Fager to Hollywood Park to run in the
Californian. The trainer thought that the conditions of the race meant Dr.
Fager would carry 127 pounds.
</P>
<P>
An official from Hollywood Park met Nerud upon his arrival at LAX. "I've got
good news and bad news," the trainer was told. "The good news is that the horse
is doing fine; the bad news is that you'll really have to carry 130 pounds."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fager won the Californian by three lengths.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park's season closes on Monday. . . . The Orange County Fair meeting
for thoroughbreds and quarter horses opens next Tuesday night at Los Alamitos.
It runs for 17 nights through Aug. 12. Post time for the first race is 6:45. .
. . At the Del Mar meet that opens next Wednesday, Gary Stevens will try to
become the first jockey to win three straight titles since Bill Shoemaker in
1952-53-54. . . . If Wayne Lukas wins his third consecutive training title, he
will join a Del Mar group that includes Willie Molter, Red McDaniel, Farrell
Jones, Bobby Frankel and Mike Mitchell. . . . The owners of Super Diamond, the
9-year-old gelding who earned $1.4 million and won the Hollywood Gold Cup and
nine other stakes, are hoping to keep the horse in competition as a jumper.

Trainer Charlie Whittingham leads Sunday Silence back to the races today in the
$1-million Super Derby, intent on ending Easy Goer's unopposed dash to the
horse-of-the-year award.
</P>
<P>
"The only chance we have to get horse of the year would be win this race and
the Breeders' Cup," Whittingham said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who lost two straight after beating Easy Goer in the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness, is expected to be an odds-on favorite in the field of
eight for the Super Derby over 1 1/4 miles at Louisiana Downs in Bossier City,
La.
</P>
<P>
The second favorite is expected to be another Phipps colt, Awe Inspiring. Also
in the field will be Le Voyageur, Big Earl, Dale's Shotgun, Bruho and Harmony
Creek.
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, winner of 10 consecutive stakes for 3-year-olds, will race against
older horses for the first time in the Ruffian Handicap over 1 1/8 miles today
at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
The field of six will include two 5-year-old mares, Bayakoa and Miss Brio.
Bayakoa has won four Grade I stakes this year; Miss Brio won the Maskette on
Sept. 9 at Belmont and has beaten Bayakoa twice.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Yankee Affair swung wide to gain the lead after entering the stretch
and won the $470,400 Man O'War Stakes for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont. Yankee
Affair returned $8.20, $4.60 and $3.80.
</P>
<P>
One Drink came from far back and then drew away to win the $53,300 Derby Trial
Stakes for 3-olds by 3 3/4 lengths at Fairplex Park in Pomona. One Drink
covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:43.
</P>
<P>
One Drink paid $10.80, $5.60 and $3.20.

RHYTHM STILL HAS PLENTY TO PROVE

<P>
Although Rhythm won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last year and was voted the
champion 2-year-old colt by the Eclipse Awards electorate, he has more to prove
than some of the horses that finished behind him in both the race and ballot
box.
</P>
<P>
Rhythm was the shakiest of Eclipse winners, not polling the most total votes
but finishing No. 1 in a bloc-voting system that was barely able to separate
him from his other rivals, Grand Canyon and Summer Squall.
</P>
<P>
Rhythm's only stakes victory came in the Breeders' Cup, his fifth and final
start as a 2-year-old. Grand Canyon, second by two lengths in the Breeders'
Cup, wound up with stakes wins at Santa Anita, Churchill Downs and Hollywood
Park and outpolled Rhythm and undefeated Summer Squall, the winner of four
stakes who missed the Breeders' race because of injury.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne, you wuz robbed," Don Clippinger wrote recently in the The Thoroughbred
Record, referring to Wayne Lukas, trainer of Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
Rhythm is trained by Shug McGaughey, who last year at this time had another
2-year-old champion, Easy Goer, in his barn. That's the extent of the
similarity, because in Easy Goer, McGaughey knew he had an exceptional colt,
who had the misfortune to be foaled in the same year as Sunday Silence. The
Eastern press raved about Easy Goer before he got to the Kentucky Derby, but
the projections for Rhythm, both from turf writers and the trainer, are
considerably more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
Others are also apprehensive. For Rhythm's debut as a 3-year-old, in the
seven-furlong Hutcheson Stakes on Saturday at Gulfstream Park, the track
linemaker has installed him as a mild 5-2 favorite, even though the race will
be run over the same surface on which the colt won in the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Second choice in the 12-horse field is Housebuster at 3-1. Housebuster's
stamina for the longer Triple Crown races is questionable, but he's dangerous
at the Hutcheson distance, having already won a six-furlong stake at Gulfstream
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon is in training at Santa Anita and won't meet Rhythm again until
Kentucky. Summer Squall also is in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Three of trainer Charlie Whittingham's seven Santa Anita Handicap winners --
Pretense, Ack Ack and Lord at War -- also won the San Antonio Handicap.
Whittingham has the potential for another such double, running Ruhlmann and
Payant on Sunday in the $300,000 San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann will be the high-weighted starter at 122 pounds and Payant has drawn
117 pounds. Their running styles put Whittingham in a good position. Ruhlmann
has early speed and Payant likes to come from well off the pace.
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who carries 120 pounds, is also expected to start, along with
Criminal Type, Complicate, Hollywood Reporter and Stylish Winner.
</P>
<P>
A successful 1989 means talented mare Bayakoa must carry 127 pounds instead of
118 in the Santa Margarita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Santa Margarita was seven stakes wins and one Eclipse Award ago for
Bayakoa. Last year, Bayakoa was spotted seven pounds by Goodbye Halo, who
finished second to her in the stake. This year, Bayakoa is the high weight and
must give two pounds to Gorgeous and considerably more to any other horses in a
small field.
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa carried 126 pounds and Gorgeous 125 when both horses easily won Santa
Margarita prep races at Santa Anita last weekend, and Ron McAnally, who trains
Bayakoa, had hoped that the spread would be the same when they have their
showdown a week from Sunday. Bayakoa is attempting to become the first
back-to-back winner of the Santa Margarita since Tizna in 1974-75.
</P>
<P>
California's 3-year-olds make another attempt to sort themselves out Saturday
when six run in the San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes at Santa Anita. Entered in
the seven-furlong race are Farma Way, Top Cash, Phantom X., Leading Laddie,
Tarascon and Mister Frisky, who makes his American debut after winning 13
consecutive races in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Ron Hansen's dual appeal for stays of an order banning him from Golden
Gate Fields was denied on separate fronts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Henry Chavez, chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, allowed Golden
Gate's ban of Hansen to remain in effect, at least until a hearing can be
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
And in Alameda County Superior Court, Hansen was denied a temporary restraining
order at Golden Gate, with his hearing to be continued on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Hansen might ride quarter horses at Bay Meadows this
weekend, but he is not named on horses at Bay Meadows for tonight or Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate part about Bill Shoemaker's last ride is that after the day --
and the race -- were specifically orchestrated for the convenience of ABC
television, the network could squeeze in only about seven minutes on its "Wide
World of Sports" program, which was dominated by boxing.
</P>
<P>
Left on the cutting-room floor were several prepared pieces on Shoemaker's
career. The telecast is just the umpteenth example of the historically
difficult relationship racing has had with television.
</P>
<P>
The night before Shoemaker's last ride, the 58-year-old jockey was honored at a
charity dinner that included Bob Hope. Two of Hope's better lines:
</P>
<P>
"People who play golf with Shoe are always worried that they're going to lose
him in the hole."
</P>
<P>
"When Shoe was born, he was so small that the doctor went to slap him and
missed."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
The Eclipse Awards will be presented tonight at a dinner in Miami Beach, Fla. .
. . Kent Desormeaux, who will pick up his statuette for best jockey, begins
riding at Santa Anita next week. A week from Monday, Desormeaux will be riding
in Saudi Arabia, where Steve Cauthen once made a celebrity appearance.
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Ferraro has been reappointed by Gov. Deukmejian to another four-year
term on the California Horse Racing Board. A new board member is John La
Follette, a San Fernando Valley attorney who starts a four-year term as a
replacement for Ray Seeley.
</P>
<P>
John Henry, who is eligible for the first time, is a cinch to be elected to
racing's Hall of Fame. There is a good chance that his trainer, Ron McAnally,
also could get elected, should he wind up on the ballot.

CRIMINAL TYPE HAS TOP CREDENTIALS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should Criminal Type be voted horse of the year despite his season-ending
injury the other day, he will be the first horse in five years to win the award
without having won a Breeders' Cup race.
</P>
<P>
The last four -- Sunday Silence, Alysheba, Ferdinand and Lady's Secret -- all
clinched their titles with Breeders' Cup victories, Lady's Secret winning the
Distaff and the three others the Classic.
</P>
<P>
Only in the first two years of the Breeders' Cup did winners of its races fail
to win the national title. In 1984, John Henry was voted horse of the year
after an injury prevented him from running in the Breeders' Cup at Hollywood
Park. Slew o' Gold lost the Classic and the title by about half a length,
finishing third (second after a stewards' disqualification) in that slam-bang
finish with Wild Again and Gate Dancer, who caused the trouble through the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
John Henry edged out Slew o' Gold in one of the closest Eclipse Awards votes.
It took a popular-vote tiebreaker to determine the winner after the Daily
Racing Form, one of the three voting groups, had favored John Henry; the turf
writers had sided with Slew o' Gold, and the track racing secretaries had split
their votes.
</P>
<P>
The next year, Spend a Buck was voted horse of the year, polling 37% of the
popular vote, even though he was retired at the end of the summer with a leg
injury. There was a notable lack of competition for the Kentucky Derby winner.
Proud Truth, who ran fifth in the Derby the only time he faced Spend a Buck,
won the Breeders' Cup Classic, but still finished 34 votes behind Spend a Buck.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ferdinand won in similar style. Ferdinand, having won only three of
nine starts, nosed out Alysheba, the Derby and Preakness winner, in the Classic
at Hollywood Park. With 38% of the total horse of the year vote, Ferdinand was
a narrow winner over Theatrical, the male grass champion.
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type's record is much better than Ferdinand's was. The 5-year-old son
of Alydar has won seven of 11 starts, and neither different track surfaces nor
the rigors of travel bothered him. He was winning at Santa Anita at the start
of the year, he won at Pimlico in the spring and then he won twice in New York,
sandwiching in a cross-country trip to Hollywood Park, where he disposed of
Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
Different distances have also been no problem. Criminal Type has won twice each
at a mile and 1 1/8 miles; and once each at 1 1/16, 1 3/16 and 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
The premature end to Criminal Type's season, caused by a sore ankle, has opened
the door for other horse-of-the-year candidates, who must do more winning in
order to impress voters.
</P>
<P>
A horse that scores consecutive victories in Saturday's Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Park and on Breeders' Cup day Oct. 27 at the New York track would
naturally get consideration. But who could that be? Sunday Silence, Easy Goer
and Housebuster preceded Criminal Type to the sidelines, and the horses left,
with the exception of Izvestia, the Canadian question mark, have shown no
consistency.
</P>
<P>
Izvestia will run Saturday in the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Who knows how good he is?" says Wayne Lukas, who trains Criminal Type. "He's
been winning big up in Canada (eight victories and a second in nine tries this
year), but let's wait and see what he does against our horses."
</P>
<P>
Sentimentally, many voters would like to see Go for Wand, the 3-year-old filly,
win Sunday's Beldame at Belmont and then try to beat males in the Breeders' Cup
Classic. Only five females have been horse of the year, the last being Lukas'
Lady's Secret in 1986. Go for Wand, who has already clinched her division
title, has a trainer, Billy Badgett, who is interested in running in the
Classic, but an owner, Jane Lunger, who will have to be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know if Go for Wand is the best female horse in the country
yet," Lukas said. Indeed, Go for Wand would have to beat Bayakoa and Gorgeous
in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, which may be a tougher assignment than running in
the injury-depleted Classic.
</P>
<P>
A forgotten horse is Summer Squall, who ran second to Unbridled in the Kentucky
Derby. Summer Squall's redemption in the Preakness seems a long time ago, and
although his owners were right to skip the Belmont, the decision may still cost
him votes.
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's only appearance since the Preakness was a Pennsylvania Derby
victory, little more than a glorified workout, and he is scheduled to run in
the Meadowlands Cup next Friday. Summer Squall needs a victory in the Classic
at Belmont, where because of state rules he wouldn't be able to run with the
anti-bleeding medication he requires.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Dr. Somerville, the French import who was scheduled to run in the $500,000 Oak
Tree Invitational at Santa Anita on Saturday, died Wednesday after receiving a
vitamin injection. "Horses get these injections 100 times a day without an
incident," said Brad MacDonald, the American trainer who would have saddled Dr.
Somerville for Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Invitational, the richest race of the season, has drawn a field of 11,
including Pay the Butler and Saratoga Passage, who ran second and third,
respectively, behind Hawkster in the stake last year. Others entered are Live
the Dream, who could give trainer Charlie Whittingham his 10th triumph in the
race; Valdali, Rial, Eradicate, Wajd, Delegant, Mehmetori, Marquetry and Soft
Machine.
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess, last year's female grass champion, carries high weight of 120
pounds, facing five opponents in the California Jockey Club Handicap at Bay
Meadows Saturday. There will be betting on the race at Santa Anita. . . .
During a time when many tracks are putting more information into their
programs, the Daily Racing Form has dropped the Belmont Park past performances
from its Los Angeles edition. The Form is also discontinuing its Monday and
Tuesday papers, unless there is racing at a major California track on those
days. . . . Itsallgreektome is headed for Belmont to run in the Breeders' Cup
Mile on Oct. 27.

HORSE RACING: WINNER ENDS A DROUGHT DATING TO THE KENTUCKY DERBY BY SQUEEZING
BETWEEN IBN BEY AND THIRTY SIX RED TO WIN $3-MILLION EVENT.

<P>
Unbridled, the 3-year-old colt who lost the winning touch after taking the
Kentucky Derby in May, won the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic by one length
over Ibn Bey Saturday at Belmont Park, thrusting himself back into the
horse-of-the-year picture.
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, Unbridled's trainer, cast his vote for the colt as horse of the
year, but Nafzger doesn't have a vote. Those who do -- about 200 turf writers,
Daily Racing Form representatives and track racing secretaries -- have these
horses to consider:
</P>
<P>
 -- Unbridled, who won the big race at the beginning and the end of the year.
He also won the Florida Derby, but otherwise he won only one allowance race in
eight starts. Saturday's victory was his first in five stakes starts since the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
 -- Criminal Type, who raced from coast to coast, winning four consecutive
major stakes and numbering Sunday Silence, Easy Goer and Housebuster among his
victims. Criminal Type missed the Breeders' Cup because of injury.
</P>
<P>
 -- Meadow Star, whose five-length victory in Saturday's Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies extended her undefeated string to seven races.
</P>
<P>
 -- Go For Wand, who was destroyed after breaking down about 100 yards from
home in a fierce duel with Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Many voters
favored Go For Wand for horse of the year before the Distaff, and she will
still poll some sympathy votes.
</P>
<P>
Reunited with jockey Pat Day, Unbridled overcame his outside post position in a
14-horse field. They were in 12th place after three-quarters of a mile in the 1
1/4-mile race before Day moved Unbridled along the rail at the top of the
stretch, then squeezed him between Thirty Six Red and Ibn Bey with about a
sixteenth of a mile to run.
</P>
<P>
Ibn Bey, a 38-1 shot from England, finished second, a length in front of Thirty
Six Red, who nosed out Lively One for third place. Rhythm, the 5-2 favorite,
finished eighth and other disappointments in the Classic were Flying
Continental and Dispersal, who finished 11th and 12th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup's international selection panel, which was under fire from
trainer Gary Jones because his Quiet American was excluded from the Classic,
may have had the last laugh. There had been suggestions that Ibn Bey and Lively
One lacked the credentials to be included in the field.
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, coupled in the betting with Home at Last, who was eased by his
jockey, Jerry Bailey, after having no chance in the stretch, paid $15.20 to win
and was timed in a slow 2:02 1/5.
</P>
<P>
Day won the first Classic with another longshot, Wild Again, at Hollywood Park
in 1984. He has won five Breeders' Cup races, one fewer than Laffit Pincay, who
won aboard Bayakoa on Saturday. Jose Santos, the only jockey to win two
Breeders' Cup races Saturday, also has five victory in the seven-year-old
series.
</P>
<P>
After winning the Florida Derby on Unbridled, Day switched to Summer Squall,
and they finished second behind Unbridled in the Kentucky Derby. Summer Squall
missed the Classic because in New York he could not run with the medication he
uses for a bleeding problem, and the mount on Unbridled opened up when Craig
Perret, who was on the colt in the Kentucky Derby, stayed with Rhythm.
</P>
<P>
"I knew this horse had one short run," Day said. "He had to overcome a lot,
with that post position, but there was a narrow opening in the stretch and he
showed a tremendous amount of courage and got the money."
</P>
<P>
First place was worth $1.35 million to owner Frances Genter, who is in her 90s.
She attended the Kentucky Derby but was not among the 51,236 at Belmont Park
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unbridled is also a bleeder, but Nafzger has been able to run him twice in New
York without medication. The trainer said the colt was dehydrated Saturday much
like he was in June when he finished fourth in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
Nafzger said that Unbridled is finished for the year and will resume running
next year.
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red, at 29-1, set swift early fractions, running six furlongs in
1:09 4/5 and the mile in 1:35 3/5. He had a two-length lead at the eighth pole
before Ibn Bey, running for the first time on dirt, and Unbridled passed him.
Lively One had traffic problems at the head of the stretch and his trainer,
Charlie Whittingham, said they might have won if the horse could have gotten
through.
</P>
<P>
"I was in great position at the quarter pole, and we were really flying," said
Alex Solis, who rode Lively One. "But then I had to take up. I got bumped
around and we lost all chance."

Sunday Silence, who won two jewels of the Triple Crown and beat Easy Goer in
the Breeders' Cup Classic, was voted 3-year-old colt of the year in the Eclipse
Awards, it was announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, expected to be voted horse of the year, missed winning the
Triple Crown when he was beaten by Easy Goer in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
Rhythm, a leading candidate to win the 1990 Kentucky Derby and a stablemate of
Easy Goer, was voted champion 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
The Ogden Phipps-owned Rhythm beat out Southern California-based Grand Canyon,
whom he defeated by two lengths in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
The other equine winners were Go For Wand, 2-year-old filly; Open Mind,
3-year-old filly; Blushing John, older male; Bayakoa, older filly or mare;
Steinlen, male turf; Brown Bess, female turf, and Safely Kept, sprinter. Safely
Kept is a 3-year-old filly.
</P>
<P>
The horse of the year and champion jockey and trainer will be announced Jan.
27.
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, who rode a record 597 winners in 1989, is the leading
candidate for jockey honors. Wayne Lukas and Charlie Whittingham are top
contenders for the trainer's award. Lukas trains Eclipse winners Open Mind, the
only horse to repeat as champion, and Steinlen and Grand Canyon. Whittingham
trains Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham co-owns Sunday Silence with Arthur B. Hancock and Dr. Ernest
Gaillard, but Phipps, who also owns Easy Goer, was voted outstanding owner for
the second consecutive year. North Ridge Farm was voted outstanding breeder.
</P>
<P>
Voting was by the racing secretaries of Thoroughbred Racing Assn.'s member
tracks, the National Turf Writers' Assn. and the Daily Racing Form.

N.Y.'S SECOND BEST IS NOT RUNNING

<P>
The second-best 3-year-old in New York will stay in his barn today while his
heralded stablemate, Easy Goer, is expected to become the shortest-priced horse
ever to win the Wood Memorial.
</P>
<P>
Despite having won five of seven starts, including the Flamingo Stakes at
Hialeah in his last race, Awe Inspiring is still playing second banana to Easy
Goer, who has won six out of eight. The horses have the same ownership -- Ogden
Phipps and his son, Dinny -- and are both trained by Shug McGaughey, who has
repeatedly said that only Easy Goer will run in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill
Downs two weeks from today.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey can see no sense running Awe Inspiring as an entry in the $500,000
Wood, the last of four major preps for the Derby, even though second-place
money at Aqueduct is more than $100,000. Awe Inspiring would probably finish
second if he ran, because the other five horses in the field are second-raters.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Diamond Donnie, ran second, 13 lengths behind Easy Goer, two weeks
ago, and the others also have modest credentials. Triple Buck is winless this
year, Rock Point has won three of 11 lifetime starts and A.M. Swinger and
Militron couldn't beat lesser opposition at Garden State Park just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring easily beat better horses than these when he won the Flamingo by
three lengths on March 25, the same day McGaughey was saddling Easy Goer for
his near-world-record 1:32 2/5 mile in the Gotham here.

The Flamingo is also a major prep for the Derby, and in most years Awe
Inspiring would be on his way to Louisville as one of the favorites in
America's premier race. This year, Awe Inspiring would be either the third or
fourth betting choice -- behind Easy Goer and Santa Anita Derby winner Sunday
Silence and possibly ahead of Blue Grass winner Western Playboy -- if he ran in
the Derby.
</P>
<P>
No matter what he does, though, Awe Inspiring is being upstaged by Easy Goer.
The other day at Belmont Park, where McGaughey trains his horses, Awe Inspiring
turned in an effective half-mile workout in :48 4/5, but 24 hours later, Easy
Goer covered the same distance 2 3/5 seconds faster.
</P>
<P>
After Awe Inspiring's workout, a story in the Daily Racing Form hinted that
McGaughey might be changing his mind about the Derby for his No. 2 colt, but in
an interview Thursday, the trainer discounted that. Ogden Phipps, who is 80,
reportedly would not care if Awe Inspiring, who races in his son's name, were
to run in the Derby, but the decision has been left to McGaughey.
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably enter both colts in the Derby," McGaughey said. "But only Easy
Goer will run. If anything should happen to Easy Goer -- God forbid -- or if
the track came up muddy, then it's possible that Awe Inspiring could run."
</P>
<P>
McGaughey concedes that Awe Inspiring has developed faster than he thought he
would. He won in his first start, in a maiden race at Belmont last September,
but by then Easy Goer already had two victories on his record.
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring was fourth in his second start, on an off track, and McGaughey
didn't race him the rest of his 2-year-old year. This winter at Gulfstream
Park, the son of Slew o' Gold won two allowance races in less than three weeks
and both jockey Jose Santos and his agent, Frank Sanabria, were saying that
this might be their Derby horse.
</P>
<P>
But when Awe Inspiring had a rough trip and finished 10th in his first stake,
the Fountain of Youth, Santos picked another horse, Kerosene, to ride in the
Everglades. Under Craig Perret, Awe Inspiring beat Kerosene by three lengths,
and the distance between them was the same in the Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
McGaughey didn't think Awe Inspiring was ready to run in the Florida Derby,
which was two weeks after the Fountain of Youth, or the colt might have won
that race, too.
</P>
<P>
Racing lore is crammed with stories of trainers whose second-best horses turned
out to be something.
</P>
<P>
In the 1973 Wood, Lucien Laurin started both Secretariat and Angle Light,
because they had different owners. Secretariat had beaten Angle Light three
times when they were 2-year-olds, and the future Triple Crown champion went
into the Wood with a 10-race winning streak, having been beaten only in the
first race of his career.
</P>
<P>
It was not widely known that Secretariat had been bothered by an abscessed
tooth. In the stretch, Ron Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey, was looking around
for Sham, the horse he thought they had to beat, when Angle Light surprised
them and won by a head. Sham was second, four lengths ahead of Secretariat, who
lost only three more races before he was retired.
</P>
<P>
Secretariat reaffirmed his superiority over Angle Light in the Kentucky Derby.
The next year, in the centennial running of the Derby, Woody Stephens ran
Judger and Cannonade as an entry. Judger had run down his stablemate in the
stretch of the Florida Derby, and was a big winner in the Blue Grass the week
before the Kentucky Derby. But at Churchill Downs, Cannonade gave Stephens his
first Derby win and Judger ran eighth.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Stephens has made a career of winning with his second string,
especially during the 1980s, when he won the Belmont Stakes five consecutive
times. Stephens got his other Derby win in 1984 with Swale, who had played
Pancho to Devil's Bag's Cisco Kid when they were 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
So when Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring are flown to Louisville from New York next
Wednesday, one horse should be put in business class and the other ought to be
flying tourist. In racing, though, the way horses are perceived or travel
doesn't always jibe with the turns that their careers take.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Chris Antley, who doesn't have a mount in the Wood, rode the winner of the
seventh race Friday, extending his record to 57 consecutive days with at least
one winner at Aqueduct. . . . The track is expected to be fast today. . . . The
shortest-priced winner of the Wood has been Native Dancer, who paid $2.20 when
he won in 1953. Easy Goer paid $2.10 -- the minimum -- in winning the Gotham.
</P>
<P>
Manastash Ridge, with Robbie Davis riding, is the 2-1 favorite today in the
$400,000 Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. The colt carries 123 pounds, three
less than Trapp Mountain, Double Quick and Clever Trevor, who are co-high
weights in the 11-horse field. . . . In the $250,000 California Derby at Golden
Gate Fields, Flying Continental is the 7-5 favorite, with Laffit Pincay seeking
his fourth victory in the race. Flying Continental, second in the Santa Anita
Derby, carries 117 pounds, two less than Endow in an eight-horse field.

IT COULD BE BIG YEAR FOR MCANALLY

<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally's barn earned more than $2.7 million last year, its best
performance since John Henry's second horse-of-the-year campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
This year, with $600,000 already in the till, McAnally could do even better.
Bayakoa, who may or may not start Sunday in the $300,000 Santa Margarita
Handicap, and Hawkster are established runners, and the 57-year-old McAnally
has five 3-year-olds capable of taking him to the Kentucky Derby at Churchill
Downs May 5.
</P>
<P>
"You never make plans, because anything can happen in racing," McAnally said.
"But in the next five or six weeks, the Derby horses will start falling into
place, and we've got five colts with a lot of quality. I think our chances are
excellent of having at least one of them go to the Derby."
</P>
<P>
McAnally's barn at Santa Anita is usually busy, but on Friday business was
especially brisk. McAnally was on the telephone to Kansas, discussing with
owner Frank Whitham whether his Bayakoa should accept the high weight of 127
pounds and try to win the 1 1/8-mile Santa Margarita for the second straight
year. Out on the track, two of those promising 3-year-olds were working. Single
Dawn went six furlongs in 1:11 3/5, much faster than McAnally wanted, and
Silver Ending covered the same distance in 1:14 2/5.
</P>
<P>
The others in McAnally's quintet are Balla Cove and Tight Spot, stakes winners
who will run in the one-mile San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita March 3, and King
of the Scots, a son of Chief's Crown who will run in a maiden race Sunday. In
1985, Chief's Crown was a major winner before and after the Triple Crown
series, but he was second in the Preakness and third in both the Derby and the
Belmont after going off the favorite in all three races.
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending, an improbable $1,500 yearling who was named by McAnally's wife,
Debbie, because of his gray tail, is the most highly rated of this bunch,
mainly because he has been the most visible. In his 3-year-old debut, Silver
Ending won the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows. The best horse Silver
Ending beat was probably his stablemate, Single Dawn, who ran third.
</P>
<P>
It was the way Silver Ending won that was impressive. "In the stretch, he was
head and head with the other horse (Individualist I)," McAnally said. "All Gary
(Stevens) did was flick his stick, and the horse quickly accelerated to win by
three lengths."
</P>
<P>
McAnally expected more of Single Dawn that day, but he was beaten by five
lengths. "He was carrying seven more pounds than Silver Ending," the trainer
said. "And the kid (jockey Alex Solis) told me afterward that he moved too soon
with the horse."
</P>
<P>
Because McAnally's Derby prospects race for different owners, he will have to
do some juggling to minimize their running against each other. Silver Ending's
next start is scheduled to be the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe Handicap at Santa
Anita on March 18. Single Dawn will be shipped to Gulfstream Park to run in the
1 1/8-mile Florida Derby the day before.
</P>
<P>
That means Single Dawn will face what appears to be a deep field of 3-year-olds
from the East. But McAnally believes he will have his colt ready, coming off a
two-month layoff. Last year, McAnally sent Hawkster to Gulfstream, where he
wilted in the Florida humidity and ran fourth.
</P>
<P>
Balla Cove, bred in England, has been quickly introduced to dirt racing here.
He ran seventh in last November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream, then
dead-heated for the win in Santa Anita's Los Feliz Stakes with Land Rush, who
may be the best of trainer Wayne Lukas' 20 Triple Crown nominees after Grand
Canyon's injury.
</P>
<P>
Tight Spot, running a mile in 1:34 while winning the El Cerrito Handicap at
Golden Gate Fields three weeks ago, is not yet eligible for the Triple Crown
races. He could have been nominated for $600 by Jan. 17, but McAnally said he
expects him to made eligible for a $3,000 payment that is due by March 17.
</P>
<P>
It won't bother trainer Neil Drysdale if McAnally withholds Bayakoa from the
Santa Margarita. Drysdale's Gorgeous will be favored if Bayakoa is scratched to
run in the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap March 4.
</P>
<P>
"When I'm running a horse, I'd like to see an exhibition race," Drysdale said.
"A walkover would be fine with me."
</P>
<P>
Even without Bayakoa, the Santa Margarita will have a six-horse field. This is
the lineup, in post-position order with jockeys and weights:
</P>
<P>
Carita Tostada, Sandy Hawley, 110 pounds; Kelly, Pat Valenzuela, 112; Nikishka,
Gary Stevens, 115; Gorgeous, Eddie Delahoussaye, 125; Luthier's Launch, Alex
Solis, 113; Invited Guest, Russell Baze, 114, and Bayakoa, Chris McCarron 127.
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who rode Bayakoa last year as she won nine of 11 starts and was
voted an Eclipse Award, was scheduled to ride the 6-year-old mare Sunday, but
he has decided to take more time for his broken collarbone to heal. Pincay told
McAnally that he will resume riding next week.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Warcraft, a son of Ack Ack who might be trainer Charlie Whittingham's best hope
for returning to the Kentucky Derby, runs Sunday at Santa Anita in a mile
allowance race. . . . Summer Squall, undefeated in six 2-year-old starts while
never running farther than 6 1/2 furlongs, will make his 1990 debut on Feb. 25,
facing older horses in a seven-furlong race at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally has trained four horses in the Kentucky Derby. His best finishes
were fourths with Super Moment in 1980 and Water Bank in 1982. Super Moment is
now at stud in Switzerland. . . . McAnally's horses earned $4.3 million in
1984, more than half of the total won by John Henry. . . . Quiet American,
second to Flying Continental in the Strub, may be headed for Gulfstream to run
in the $200,000 Donn Handicap next Saturday.

   Sunday Silence, the Kentucky Derby winner, won
a photo-finish duel with Easy Goer by a nose on Saturday to win the
$674,200 Preakness at Pimlico and a chance at horse racing's first
Triple Crown since 1978.
   No horse has won the Derby, Preakness and the Belmont Stakes
since Affirmed won all three races in 1978.
   Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, the beaten favorite in the
Kentucky Derby and the favorite again Saturday, ran
eyeball-to-eyeball in the stretch as the crowd screamed itself
hoarse. At the wire, Sunday Silence won by a nose.
   Before the victory became official, the stewards deliberated a
foul claim filed against Sunday Silence and jockey Pat Valenzuela
by Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer.
   Easy Goer finished five lengths in front of Rock Point, who was
two lengths ahead of Dansil. Completing the order of finish were
Hawkster, Houston, Pulverizing and Northern Wolf.
   Sunday Silence carried 126 pounds over the 1 3-16 miles in 1:53
4-5, the third fastest time of the 114 Preaknesses.
   The winner paid $6.20, $3 and $3.20, unbeaten in four starts as
a 3-year-old. His next race will be the 1{-mile Belmont Stakes June
10 at Belmont Park. Easy Goer paid $2.40 and $2.40 while Rock Point
was $3.60 to show.

<P>
Sunday Silence finally beat Easy Goer by a mile on Saturday when the 3-year-old
champion of 1989 overwhelmed his East Coast nemesis in balloting for horse of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The near black colt with the squiggle of white down his face received 223 of
242 votes, based on a season that included victories over Easy Goer in the
Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence also won the Super Derby, Santa Anita Derby and the San Felipe
Handicap, losing only to Easy Goer in the Belmont Stakes and to Prized in the
Swaps Stakes.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham, who owns Sunday Silence in partnership with Arthur Hancock
and Dr. Ernest Gaillard, was also a lopsided winner of the Eclipse Award for
top trainer of 1989. The Eclipse for the best jockey went to the record-setting
Kent Desormeaux. JAY HOVDEY

VALENZUELA SUSPENDED FOR DAY;
</P>
<P>
JOCKEY: STEWARDS TO DECIDE TODAY IF FURTHER PENALTIES ARE NECESSARY FOR RIDER
WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE.
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jockey Pat Valenzuela, who tested positive for cocaine in a urine sample
collected Oct. 20, was removed from his mounts Thursday at Santa Anita but the
board of stewards delayed until this morning their decision on further
penalties.
</P>
<P>
The stewards also are investigating an apparent breakdown in communication
between their drug testing laboratory and local racing board investigators.
According to several sources, a laboratory representative told a racing board
investigator last Sunday that Valenzuela's Oct. 20 sample had tested clean
when, in fact, results of the test had not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
As a result of that report -- given over the phone -- the stewards allowed
Valenzuela to be named on horses this week. Then, late Wednesday afternoon, the
stewards received formal documentation of Valenzuela's positive test.
</P>
<P>
The delay in the ruling also left trainer Charlie Whittingham and majority
owner Arthur Hancock without a definite rider on Kentucky Derby winner Sunday
Silence for the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
"It's my policy to leave any jockey decisions up to the trainer," Hancock said
from his Stone Farm in Lexington, Ky. "Charlie's got much more experience in
these matters than I do."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said: "I won't make a decision on who rides the colt until the
stewards make their decision."
</P>
<P>
Whittingham did prepare for Valenzuela's possible suspension, however, by
letting Chris McCarron work Sunday Silence six furlongs Thursday morning. The
sleek black colt responded with a clocking of 1:12 1/5, which was the fastest
workout of the day at the distance.
</P>
<P>
"If something should happen that Pat can't ride, I wanted to make sure Chris
had a feel of the horse," Whittingham said.
</P>
<P>
After praising Sunday Silence's workout, McCarron said that he looked forward
to the possibility of riding the colt in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
"You never like to benefit from another person's misfortune," said McCarron,
who won the 1988 Classic on Alysheba. "But I would be lying if I said I don't
want to ride Sunday Silence."
</P>
<P>
Steward Pete Pedersen said he and fellow stewards Hubert S. Jones and Thomas
Ward had the option of "suspension, fine or referral of the case to the racing
commission" in the Valenzuela matter.
</P>
<P>
"We realize there is a need to resolve the situation because the Breeders' Cup
is so close," Pedersen said. "But even though we believe we have all the facts
at hand, we felt it best to take a day to consider everything before making a
decision."
</P>
<P>
The stewards met for more than two hours Thursday morning with Valenzuela, his
attorney Steve Schwartz, two members of the local racing board investigative
unit, and Jay Weiss, vice president of BPL Toxicology Laboratories in Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
According to Pedersen, a lab technician at BPL told racing board investigator
Jeff Crandall last Sunday that Valenzuela's Oct. 20 sample had tested negative
for a list of controlled substances, among them cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Pedersen noted further that another of Valenzuela's samples, collected last
Sunday, had tested negative for all substances in a report issued Tuesday. It
was not until Wednesday that the stewards received official word on the Oct. 20
test, a delay caused apparently by the necessity to confirm the presence of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
"We are now satisfied that Pat did test positive," Pedersen said Thursday after
the hearing. "There was obviously a misunderstanding between the lab and the
investigator on that telephonic report, and that's something we are looking
into.
</P>
<P>
"It makes us (the stewards) feel like suckers, to go ahead and let the rider be
named on horses," Pedersen added. "However, in this particular case the
miscommunication is a red herring. The only important thing is the test itself.
And from the experts we've talked to, it is accurate."
</P>
<P>
Weiss said Thursday that BPL president and technical supervisor Nissan Pardo
would be interviewing the lab technician who issued Sunday's oral report on
Valenzuela's test, and would pass along his findings to the Santa Anita
stewards.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, I don't think it would appropriate to comment further on the
matter," Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
Mike Kilpack, the Southern Region supervisor of racing board investigators, was
conducting his own inquiry into the incident. He noted that the racing board
had been using the BPL drug-testing services for jockeys and other licensed
personnel for about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"We have received verbal reports from BPL many times in the past, but this is
the very first time something has gone wrong," Kilpack said. "I would imagine
there will be some changes in-house in terms of verifying any reports in the
future."
</P>
<P>
Steve Schwartz, Valenzuela's attorney, said that the discrepancy in lab reports
would be considered in any legal response the jockey might have to the
stewards' ultimate ruling.
</P>
<P>
"But there are a lot of considerations to be made, and not only regarding the
tests," Schwartz said. "Certainly the human factor must be taken into account,
and the well-being of the individual involved."
</P>
<P>
Schwartz would not say if Valenzuela would seek an injunction to continue
riding in the event a suspension is handed down.
</P>
<P>
The last time a jockey was suspended because of a positive drug test in
Southern California was in February, 1987, when Martin Pedroza got a 20-day
suspension.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1988, Valenzuela was suspended indefinitely for failing to honor
riding commitments. He was reinstated six months later after spending the
summer competing at Hawthorne Race Course in Chicago. Valenzuela has been
tested regularly since his return, but not nearly as often in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"In 20 to 30 tests, Pat has never had a positive before," Pedersen said. "But
he has been a concern for some time."
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's struggle with drug dependency received national attention last May
when he won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes aboard Sunday Silence,
defeating the darling of the East Coast, Easy Goer, in both races.
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer bounced back to defeat Sunday Silence in the subsequent Belmont
Stakes, which set up the ultimate showdown between the two colts in the
Breeders' Cup Classic. The winner figures to be voted horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who is also 25% owner of Sunday Silence, was sticking steadfastly
by the beleaguered Valenzuela in the midst of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
"If he's suspended, then he can't ride him, can he?" Whittingham said. "But
until something happens, Valenzuela is No. 1 and McCarron is No. 2."

<P>
On the phone from Atlantic City, N.J., where a casino-hotel had given him an
award, trainer Laz Barrera sounded upbeat for a change.
</P>
<P>
This has not been one of Barrera's better years. His malaise is not related to
losing races, or even to the vexing problems of his favorite baseball team, the
New York Yankees, who are playing at a sub-.500 level and who committed six
errors the other night.
</P>
<P>
These are mere trivialities contrasted to what struck Barrera and his son,
Albert, a few months ago. Just days apart, they were notified by California
racing authorities that horses they ran had tested positive for cocaine in
postrace samplings.
</P>
<P>
The Barreras and some other trainers twisted in the wind before the state, in a
development as bizarre as the accusations themselves, dropped the cases last
week.
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera's hearing had been scheduled for this week, but now the 65-year-old
trainer has the opportunity to talk about Affirmed, the brilliant chestnut colt
who became the 11th and most recent horse to sweep the Triple Crown, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, another California-based colt, can become the 12th Triple Crown
champion by winning the Belmont Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In winning the Triple Crown, Affirmed outfinished Alydar in all three races as
they established the benchmark by which all great equine rivalries have since
been measured. Affirmed beat the late-running Alydar by 1 1/2 lengths in the
Derby and by a neck in the Preakness. In the Belmont, after the horses had
battled head to head for the last mile of the 1 1/2-mile race, Affirmed and
jockey Steve Cauthen, who had recently turned 18, prevailed by a head at the
wire.
</P>
<P>
This year's Preakness -- in which Sunday Silence dueled the length of the
Pimlico stretch with Easy Goer before winning by a nose -- is being compared to
the 1978 Belmont.
</P>
<P>
There are other comparisons being made with the 1978 Triple Crown, because Easy
Goer is a look-alike son of Alydar and could match his sire's unwanted record
of finishing second in all three races.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as Affirmed and Alydar all over again at all," Barrera said
the other day. "My horse and Alydar raced against each other all those times
when they were 2-year-olds, and we beat him most of the time. These two horses
didn't start running against each other until the Derby."
</P>
<P>
In 1977, with both horses stabled in New York, Affirmed won four of six races
against Alydar. After the Triple Crown, their only other race together resulted
in a bittersweet win for Alydar, on a foul in the Travers at Saratoga, which
left Affirmed with an edge of 7-3.
</P>
<P>
Affirmed had run 15 times by the time he reached the Belmont, and the Belmont
was Alydar's 17th race. Saturday will be the ninth start for Sunday Silence and
the 12th race for Easy Goer.
</P>
<P>
"Affirmed had lost about 100 pounds by the time we got to the Belmont," Barrera
said. "We just kept him in light training leading up to the race."
</P>
<P>
When Affirmed won the Belmont, the racing world might have been getting jaded
about Triple Crown champions. After Citation had won the three races in 1948,
there was a gap of 25 years before Secretariat swept the series in 1973, and
then Seattle Slew in 1977 and Affirmed became the only consecutive winners of
the crown.
</P>
<P>
"Affirmed was out of gas by the time he got to the Belmont," said Billy Turner,
who trained Seattle Slew. "He looked like he'd run 1,000 races. But Alydar was
just as bad because he had run most of the same races. In the Belmont, those
two old veterans just leaned on each other all through the stretch."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Sunday Silence can replace Affirmed as the most recent winner of the
Triple Crown, Barrera said: "He's got a big chance. I talked to (trainer)
Charlie Whittingham the other day, and he said that his horse has been doing
wonderfully since he got to New York. He's already beaten the other horse
twice, and that last race -- the Preakness -- was a big race for Sunday
Silence."
</P>
<P>
By now, the Alydar-Easy Goer connection is wearing thin with Shug McGaughey,
Easy Goer's trainer. But Whittingham likes the comparison to the 1978 Triple
Crown. "Affirmed and Alydar suits me fine," Whittingham said. "As long as I've
got Affirmed."
</P>
<P>
The Triple Crown has been doubly kind to Barrera. In 1976, he won the Kentucky
Derby and the Belmont with Bold Forbes. In the Preakness, Bold Forbes led for
three-quarters of a mile while running unrealistically fast fractions, then was
run down by Elecutionist in the stretch and finished third, beaten by four
lengths.
</P>
<P>
Still, Barrera believes that the three-race grind over five weeks is too much
to ask of a young horse.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the distances, it's the weights the horses are asked to carry," he
said. "They pack 126 pounds in all three races, and that's a punishing weight
for a horse who might not even be technically 3 years old yet. The weight is a
crime, because nobody benefits from it. They should make the weight 120 pounds
-- 115 pounds for fillies -- and it wouldn't be as hard on the horses. The
jockeys can make that kind of weight. If they can't, they don't belong in the
game."
</P>
<P>
Even though he doesn't have to prove his innocence over the cocaine matter,
Barrera still feels that he was humiliated by the charges. His horse that
allegedly tested positive was Endow, a grandson of Exclusive Native, the sire
of Affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"They should have conducted the investigation before they announced our names,"
Barrera said. "How many trainers would have the money to defend themselves if
their names were involved in something like this? I feel like it's over, but it
won't ever really go away."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Scattered showers might continue here today and Friday. Sunday Silence can
handle an off track -- as he did in winning the Kentucky Derby -- but Easy Goer
dislikes mud. Trainer Shug McGaughey said that he would probably still run Easy
Goer if there's an off track Saturday. . . . McGaughey's wife, Mary Jane, gave
birth to their second child -- both sons -- last Friday. The boy, delivered by
Caesarean section, has been named John Reeve McGaughey. . . . Pat Valenzuela,
who will ride Sunday Silence in the Belmont, arrived at the track Tuesday and
is riding a few races here each day this week.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S THE PERFECT TRAINER FOR THE PERFECT RACE HORSE

Even the horses love Laz Barrera. They must. They run right out of their
breeding for him. There is a saying around the race track: If you've got a
cheap horse, there's a dozen guys you can give him to. If you've got a good
horse, there's only one -- give him to Laz Barrera.
</P>
<P>
A good trainer cannot make a bad horse win. But a bad trainer can make a good
horse lose.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the Puerto Rican owners of Bold Forbes thought they had a pretty good
horse. Bold Forbes had beaten the best Puerto Rico had to offer, but beating
the best at El Commandante was a far cry from beating the best at Aqueduct,
Santa Anita, Churchill Downs and Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
By the time Laz got through with him, Bold Forbes had won at Santa Anita,
Aqueduct (the Wood Memorial), Churchill Downs (the Kentucky Derby) and Belmont
(the Belmont) and came within a clipped and bleeding coronet suffered in the
Preakness of winning the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive bit of conditioning. Bold Forbes was out of a Bold Ruler
line and not supposed to be able to get any distance longer than 1 1/16 miles.
"He'll need a cab at the eighth pole," sneered the handicappers. But Bold
Forbes not only got the Derby's 1 1/4 miles, he won the Belmont's 1 1/2 miles.
</P>
<P>
But that was 14 years ago. Earlier this year, Laz Barrera got another call from
Puerto Rico. Martha Fernandez, whose husband is in the construction business on
the island, explained to Laz that she bought this colt at the Ocala sales for
$15,000, but while his breeding seemed undistinguished, he won 13 consecutive
races. He might deserve the big leagues, and she hated to think she was keeping
him in the bush leagues.
</P>
<P>
Now, Laz sometimes feels like a football coach who gets called by an
enthusiastic alumnus about a can't-miss prospect. And when he asks, "And who is
this phenom?" the answer comes back, "My nephew."
</P>
<P>
So, Laz tried to be diplomatic. It's his stock-in-trade. "What's the horse's
name?" he wanted to know. "Mister Frisky," came the answer.
</P>
<P>
Now, that didn't have a nice macho ring to it like Man o'War or Aristides or
Gallant Fox. It sounded a little Disneylandish, a little frivolous. Maybe the
horse was, too. Laz temporized. "Send me some tapes," he sighed.
</P>
<P>
You can't always tell a bad horse from moving pictures. But you can spot a good
one right away. Laz watched the tapes and felt his scalp begin to prickle. This
was the greatest movie horse since Trigger. The owner phoned. "Do you think
this horse can win in the States?" she wanted to know. "Ma'am!" Barrera
exploded. "This horse can win anywhere!"
</P>
<P>
Recalls Laz: "This horse had a style of running only the great ones have, where
his feet stay low to the ground and he just eats up the track. I spent four
days watching the tape and I couldn't find a fault with him. He never made a
wrong move."
</P>
<P>
Still, San Juan is not Santa Anita. Laz brought his colt up out of quarantine
and dropped him into the seven-furlong San Vicente Stakes, traditional
steppingstone for the Santa Anita (and Kentucky) Derby and a tough test for an
immigrant. Mister Frisky turned back promising 3-year-olds such as Tarascon and
Top Cash with ease. Three weeks later, Laz tacked him for the tougher one-mile
San Rafael Stakes. He won more easily -- 15 for 15, one off Citation's all-time
string of 16 for 16.
</P>
<P>
Is he another Citation? Is he another Bold Forbes? Is he another Man o'War? Is
he a freak? A monster (race-trackers' word for horses that outrun their
breeding and run past horses theoretically their superiors)? Or is he just a
nice sprinter making the most of a bad year for 3-year-olds?
</P>
<P>
First of all, Mister Frisky looks like a champion. Statues in the paddock look
like this. He has this great, gorgeous coating of solid copper; there is not a
white stocking or nose blaze to break up the burnished metal tone of his skin.
They called Man o'War Big Red because he glinted like this in the sunlight, and
Mister Frisky looks like the color of a brand-new shiny penny.
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera's Cuban accent has been described as a cross between Desi Arnaz
with hiccups and Ricardo Montalban with a mouthful of mashed potatoes -- "You
can never tell whether Laz is speaking English with a Spanish accent or Spanish
with an English accent," cracks fellow trainer Charlie Whittingham. It is
sometimes indecipherable in any language. But he gets positively eloquent on
the subject of Mister Frisky. William Jennings Bryan couldn't say it any
better.
</P>
<P>
Laz notes, among other things, that Mister Frisky is a placid individual. He
has that attitude of the player who knows he's good. He has that ability all
great athletes have of being able to relax between spurts of competition. If he
were a fighter, he would be able to go to sleep on the rubbing table an hour
before a title fight. He never arrives in a paddock awash with anxiety and
soapy sweat. "He has not been touched with the whip -- at least not in this
country," Laz boasts. He does it his way.
</P>
<P>
If Mister Frisky gets him to the winner's circle in Kentucky the first Saturday
in May, Laz Barrera will have the best winning percentage of any trainer in the
history of the Derby. He already is, except for the Jones Boys of Calumet Fame.
</P>
<P>
Laz has won two Kentucky Derbies out of four tries. Plain Ben Jones won six
Derbies out of 11 tries. His son, Jimmy, won two out of four. Col. E.R.
Bradley's trainer, Herbert J. Thompson, won four Derbies -- but he sent out 24
horses.
</P>
<P>
Laz, who has been training horses since he was brought up on the old Oriental
Park race track in Havana that his grandparents owned and operated -- and which
Castro turned into an army barracks -- is not so concerned for Mister Frisky to
be another Bold Forbes as he is for him to be another Affirmed.
</P>
<P>
You see, not only did Affirmed win the Triple Crown, but Laz considers him to
be the greatest race horse of all time. His logic is unassailable. "He is the
best horse I ever see and maybe anybody ever see and I will tell you why: None
of those other horses -- Citation, Secretariat, Man o'War -- had to beat what
Affirmed had to beat: Alydar. Alydar was a great race horse. If Affirmed wasn't
there, Alydar wins the Triple Crown. And he is recognized as one of the five
best horses of all time. And Affirmed beat him every time. Wouldn't let him by.
I don't know who Citation and Seattle Slew and those horses had to beat, but it
wasn't Alydar."
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Derby is the hardest race in the world to win. But Laz Barrera has
already won two. And Mister Frisky probably thinks it's a piece of cake. Now,
winning in Puerto Rico, that's hard.

<P>
A horse they thought so little of they did everything but leave him on a park
bench with a note on him won the Kentucky Derby Saturday and may be the
greatest thing to come down a homestretch in this decade and maybe in several.
</P>
<P>
If he was a cat they might have drowned him at birth. He was knock-kneed, he
wobbled when he walked like a teen-ager in high-heels. He was so ugly he was
almost 2 years old before they were sure he wasn't going to be a camel.
</P>
<P>
Twice, they tried to auction him off. But the horse-buying public was too smart
for that.
</P>
<P>
Nobody wanted Sunday Silence till Charlie Whittingham got a look at him.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham has been around race horses since the days of Dan Patch. He
knows they don't have to look like something out of a Roy Rogers movie. You
judge a horse with a clock, not a mirror. Man o' War might have had a lousy
profile.
</P>
<P>
Charlie liked Sunday Silence so much, he bought half of him. The horse the
tuxedoed auctioneers could not get a nibble on looked to Charlie like a bigger
bargain than a hot diamond.
</P>
<P>
The horse who won $574,200 Saturday and $980,000 in his life wouldn't bring
$17,000 at a dispersal sale two years ago. When Arthur Hancock III declined
that sale price, his partners backed out. "You take him, then," was their
attitude.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, on the other hand, reacted as if a rich uncle had just left him an
oil field. He couldn't believe a horse this good would be available at any
price. The horse was not only good, he was as well-behaved as a Boy Scout and
as trainable as a circus seal. Talent often comes coupled with moodiness,
truculence, temperament. Talent often hates to be told what to do and how to do
it. Good Soldier Schweiks, they're not. Sunday Silence was like a kid who eats
his vegetables and cleans the blackboards. If he could talk, he would say "Yes,
sir!"
</P>
<P>
That's all Charlie Whittingham needs -- a fast horse who will do what he tells
him.
</P>
<P>
So, the horse nobody wanted is the toast of Kentucky today. He won the coldest
-- and the slowest in 30 years -- Kentucky Derby on a gelid May Saturday when
sleet swept down the backstretch and a cold wind whipped in the horses' faces
on the turn for home.
</P>
<P>
Was the winner much the best? Well, look at it this way: How many Kentucky
Derbies do you see with the winner running sideways in the stretch?
</P>
<P>
The race was run in the slow-freight time of 2:05. Horses move faster than that
pulling surreys. That was the slowest Derby since 1958. There's no telling what
Sunday Silence might have run if he hadn't come down the stretch like a guy
carrying a football -- or being thrown out of a waterfront bar. Saddle broncs
in a rodeo do less jumping around. Patrick Valenzuela must have thought he was
trying to stay on a Brahma bull.
</P>
<P>
The least surprised guy in Kentucky was Charlie Whittingham. Whittingham has
been telling everybody who would listen for months that his horse was something
special. It was such a startling change of posture for Charlie that the public
chunked in $592,058 on his horse to win.
</P>
<P>
It has always considered an act of faith back here in the bluegrass country
that horses who come over the mountain from the Pacific are, by definition,
"nice little California sprinters." They're not supposed to like it when
anything draws alongside them.
</P>
<P>
The horse who was supposed to expose them at Churchill this year was a speed
demon infelicitously named Easy Goer. Tracksiders couldn't make up their minds
whether he was another Man o' War -- or merely another Secretariat. Wonder
Horse III. He didn't even need to be whipped. He had won the Wood Memorial
under a hand ride like a horse on a bridal path being ridden by a debutante. He
had come within a click of a world mile record with nothing chasing him. No one
had ever shopped him around or put an ad in the paper or offered to throw in
the saddle if someone would bid on him.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham was unimpressed. "Maybe he's a wonder horse," observed
Charlie. "He better be."
</P>
<P>
He wasn't. It was a case of easy come, Easy Goer. He did finish second. It was
the second time he had lost at Churchill in six months. Maybe he didn't care
for the track. It was hard to. It was greasier than a truck stop hamburger. The
field often looked like Charlie Chaplin trying to cross a waxed dance floor.
</P>
<P>
It was vindication of two sorts for his principal owner, Arthur Hancock III. He
not only refused to sell Sunday Silence short -- twice -- but he had the laugh
on those who said he was not serious enough to run the family heirloom,
Claiborne Farms. When Arthur Three got out of college, he passed up mucking the
family stalls in favor of playing a guitar in honky-tonks and writing songs
about guys whose wives left them for truck drivers and took the kids with them.
He even named Sunday Silence from a Kris Kristofferson lament titled, "Sunday
Morning, Coming Down."
</P>
<P>
The family wasn't sure they wanted a guy who would rather be Willie Nelson than
a stud farmer, rather have a hit record than a Derby horse. Arthur took his
guitar and left home.
</P>
<P>
Claiborne Farms had 34 horses in 28 Derbies, winning two of them. Arthur Three
has been in four Derbies and won two.
</P>
<P>
The horse nobody wanted and the owner the family didn't want either hauled down
the biggest prize in racing Saturday. If he -- they -- win the Triple Crown,
they may set a new trend in the sport of kings. Get owners out of rock concerts
and horses out of the Yellow Pages.

1990: IT HAS BEEN A YEAR OF TEARS

<P>
The major part of the racing year has been framed by elderly women crying.
</P>
<P>
In May, at Churchill Downs, Frances Genter, 92, cried as her 3-year-old colt,
Unbridled, crossed the finish line, winning the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
And last Saturday, at Belmont Park, Jane du Pont Lunger, 76, cried in anguish
when her 3-year-old filly, Go For Wand, snapped a foreleg in the stretch of the
Breeders' Cup Distaff and was destroyed on the track.
</P>
<P>
About two hours after that tragedy, Unbridled, not out of sight but virtually
out of mind since his Derby victory, won the Breeders' Cup Classic against
older horses, bouncing back into contention for horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter, who recently broke a hip in a fall, and is suffering from high
blood pressure, couldn't be at Belmont last Saturday. The Bloomington (Minn.)
woman watched on television as Unbridled won, and then she had her family
replay the race over and over on a VCR.
</P>
<P>
There were no requests anywhere for replays of Go For Wand's last race, and
reruns of the spill in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, which led to the deaths of two
other horses, were not popular for the same reason. These are race tapes that
should be kept in permanent storage, along with the video of Ruffian's
breakdown in the match race against Foolish Pleasure at Belmont in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter couldn't come to the phone Wednesday, but her husband, Earl
Knudtson, talked about last Saturday in Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
When Go For Wand went down about a sixteenth of a mile from home, Knudtson said
that the accident reminded his wife of why she seldom races her horses more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
"She's always afraid they're going to get hurt, like Go For Wand was," Knudtson
said. "She figures she's fortunate getting just two years of enjoyment out of a
horse, and usually retires them after that.
</P>
<P>
"Remember Smile (winner of the Breeders' Cup Sprint in 1986)? She went too far
with him, trying to race him the following year (as a 5-year-old). Now she's
always hesitant about running horses too long."
</P>
<P>
Genter will make an exception, though, with Unbridled, who is scheduled to get
a rest before he returns to the races as a 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the few survivors of a punishing season for the top horses. Even
before the multiple wipeout in the Breeders' Cup, racing had lost Sunday
Silence, Easy Goer, Criminal Type, Golden Pheasant, Eastern Echo and Gorgeous
through injuries.
</P>
<P>
None will be back next year, nor will Safely Kept, In the Wings and Royal
Academy, Breeders' Cup winners who are being retired.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, at least there was the prospect -- unrealized, it turned out -- of
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer renewing their heated rivalry. Nothing is nearly
so promising this time. The notable holdovers are Unbridled, Summer Squall,
Housebuster and Bayakoa.
</P>
<P>
The crop of 2-year-old colts has no one enthralled, and Meadow Star, the
undefeated 2-year-old filly and a Triple Crown candidate, did not run on
Breeders' Cup day like a horse who could handle colts at 1 1/4 miles. Meadow
Star won her race, but only after Jose Santos had to whip the horse 22 times
through the stretch to keep her interest.
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Jolley, who trains Meadow Star, also trained Foolish Pleasure. After
Ruffian died, Jolley harshly said: "This is not a game for anybody wearing
short pants."
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, the day after Go For Wand's fatal injury, Jolly was more
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
"Every day, we (trainers) live with the thought that a horse might get hurt,"
he said. "And you hate the thought, but every time horses run, their lives are
on the line."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye is riding two of the morning-line favorites at Santa Anita
in Saturday's California Cup, the 5-2 Shirkee in the Mile and Pillaring, who is
7-5 in the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
Other favorites in the seven races, which are worth $1 million, are Variety
Road, who is 3-1 in the Classic; Sensational Star, even money in the Sprint;
Paper Princess, 7-2 in the Distaff; Theresa's Pleasure, 7-2 in the Juvenile
Fillies; and Meadow's Interco, 7-2 in the Starter Handicap.
</P>
<P>
Snow Chief, whose owner, Ben Rochelle, is sponsoring one of the races, will be
in the Santa Anita walking ring before the Juvenile and will also make an
appearance on the track. Snow Chief, champion 3-year-old colt in 1986, stands
at stud at Valley Creek Farm in Valley Center, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Grace, the 3-year-old Roberto filly who races for Darby Dan Farm, has
arrived at Santa Anita to join an estimated 11 other fillies and mares for
Sunday's $400,000 Yellow Ribbon. Plenty of Grace won the Queen Elizabeth
Challenge Cup at Keeneland in her last start. . . . Rial and Eradicate, the 1-2
finishers in the Oak Tree Invitational, are scheduled to run Monday, the
closing day of the meeting, in the $200,000 Burke Handicap.
</P>
<P>
The battle for the national money title among jockeys will be largely settled
at Hollywood Park, with Jose Santos coming from New York to ride in California
the last two months of the year. Gary Stevens is the leader, by about $500,000.
Hollywood's 37-day meeting starts next Wednesday and runs through Dec. 24. . .
. Corwyn Bay, who almost tripped over Mr. Nickerson in the Breeders' Cup
Sprint, is back in California, with cuts on both hind legs. He'll be rested
until the Santa Anita winter season opens on Dec. 26.

<TEXT>
   Is Easy Goer the horse of the year?
Maybe so, maybe not.
Sunday Silence, his conqueror in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, chewed oats in California last weekend, perhaps contemplating revenge for his defeat by E.G. in last June's Belmont Stakes.
Perhaps, though, Sunday Silence was merely contemplating his oats.
One never knows.

   S.S. could have come to the sitzbath capital of upstate New York in search of the $653,100 first prize that the Saratoga folks were offering to the winner of Saturday's Travers Stakes, its ancient showpiece race for three-year-olds, but he didn't.
In his absence, Easy Goer bagged the winner's check, beating the front-running Clever Trevor to the wire by a widening three lengths over 1 1/4 miles.

   The victory was fully expected by an overflow throng of 49,000, which made Easy Goer a 1-to-5 favorite in a six-horse field.
That produced a return of $2.40 on a $2 win bet and made such tickets as valuable as souvenirs as in bills and coins.
Payout-window lines, however, indicated that most winners were cashing theirs.

   The New York Racing Association, eager to hype its attractions, annually spices the Travers by pointing to all the notable favorites that have lost it.
The list is impressive, including such as Tom Fool, Affirmed, Conquistador Cielo and Alysheba.
On the other hand, Man o' War, Whirlaway, Native Dancer and Buckpasser all won it as the people's choices, and favorites have triumphed in 41 of the last 87 goes, a proportion well in excess of the national average of about 33%.
The reputation of the race as a favorite's graveyard seems to be peculiarly a perception of New Yorkers, who deem it a scandal anytime a favorite is beaten.

   That 49,000 people would show up for a race in a town whose usual population is 26,000 illustrates the extent of the Gothamite invasion.
Saratoga is where New York horseplayers go to rusticate in August, and the place certainly is a change from the big city's asphalt acres.
Victorian mansions with broad front porches line Union Avenue outside the track, and one can easily conjure up visions of broad-beamed gentlemen and bustled ladies fanning themselves thereon.

   There are stepping stones in front of the track's grandstand entrance for any carriage trade that may happen along, and chalk boards on the premises also bespeak an earlier era.
In the paddock and the adjacent and ample picnic area, one can tread on real dirt and be shaded by real trees.
People lounge on blankets and lawn chairs.
The ambience smacks of a country fair.

   An enlightened track policy allows racegoers to bring along coolers bearing various alcoholic beverages, and these were consumed with moderation everywhere I looked.
This is in contrast with Churchill Downs on Kentucky Derby day, where the confiscation of alcohol at the gates forces patrons to pay up for those awful mint juleps inside, and, perhaps relatedly, drunkenness is rampant.

   At the same time, Saratoga is up to date enough to make wandering New Yorkers feel at home.
Signs in front of several of the manses proclaim them to have been condo-ized, the track offers Pick Six and trifecta wagering along with other new-fangled betting gimmicks, and lines everywhere are Manhattan-long.
Shut Out is known hereabouts not only as the winner of the 1942 Travers, but also, uncapitalized, as the fate of would-be bettors who tarry.

   Easy Goer tarried not a bit on Saturday, and his time of 2:00 4/5 was the third-fastest in an affair that dates from 1864.
The handsome chestnut colt's sole serious competition, both on form and in actuality, was Clever Trevor, a high-pocketed product of Oklahoma.
He was handled easily.

   The afternoon's real suspense was provided not by any of Easy Goer's equine foes but by the threat of rain; E.G.'s two most-celebrated defeats in a 14-race, 10-win career came on muddy tracks at Churchill Downs, first in the Breeder's Cup event for two-year-olds last November, and again in May's Kentucky Derby.

   Saturday's weather forecast called for showers, but they held off until about 20 minutes after the Travers was completed, an indication that the Man Upstairs liked this particular favorite as much as the local fancy.

   Another threat to the winner came from adoring fans who cheered his every movement from barn to paddock to racetrack.
Easy Goer was distracted by the commotion, reared while being saddled and had to be calmed.
"Running the race seemed easy after that," noted Pat Day.

   Clever Trevor's shot depended on his getting far enough ahead to negate Easy Goer's stretch drive, but that was not to be.
Clever Trevor was dogged from the outset by Roi Danzig and never led by more than two lengths.
Easy Goer overtook Clever Trevor in the homestretch, hesitated for a moment, then pulled away after a whip-tap from Day.
Roi Danzig faded to last; Shy Tom, a member of the D. Wayne Lukas-trained phalanx, was third.

   Post-race testimony had to do largely with E.G.'s place in history.
Owner Ogden Phipps also was the proprietor of the great Buckpasser, who won the '66 Travers.
He declined any direct comparison, but said that Easy Goer won his Travers more easily than Buckpasser had.
Trainer C.R. "Shug" McGaughey noted that Easy Goer had posted three straight wins since losing the Preakness, and opined that this should meet the criterion for consistency.
"We didn't go to the bottom of the barrel with the horse" even with his near-record clocking, offered jockey Day.

   Easy Goer and Sunday Silence are scheduled to follow separate paths until, probably, the Breeder's Cup in November at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
That oughta be a good one.

   Meantime, as workmen picked up the debris left by the huge crowd, a woman remarked to a companion that the scene reminded her of Woodstock 20 years ago.
"Yeah, Woodstock with pari-mutuel tickets," the fella said.

TINY MITE APOLLO RECORDS ANOTHER EASY VICTORY IN NEAR-RECORD TIME

<P>
The smallest horse in trainer Gary Jones' barn continues to belie his size on
the race track. Apollo, winner of his first two starts, won again Friday,
running six furlongs in a near-record 1:08 3/5 to take the $79,800 San Miguel
Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
Without any reminders from jockey Chris McCarron's whip, Apollo missed the
stakes record, set by MacArthur Park in 1972, by a fifth of a second.
</P>
<P>
Standing at a little more than 15 hands (five feet), Apollo doesn't have a very
large stride. If he were a baseball pitcher, scouts would call the 2-year-old
Falstaff-Tumble Along colt sneaky fast.
</P>
<P>
"He ran much faster than he felt," McCarron said. "He deceived me. He was so
much within himself that it was pathetic. All I did was shake the stick at
him."
</P>
<P>
Jones doesn't think Apollo will get much bigger. "I don't care how big he is,"
the trainer said, "as long as he gives me enough (winners' circle) pictures."
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, who saddled Intimate Kid in the San Miguel, saw Jones in the
barn area Friday morning. "Your horse won't be ahead of mine down the
backstretch," Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
Intimate Kid tried to run with Apollo through early fractions of 21 2/5 and 44
1/5, but couldn't head him. "The other horse kept going, and mine stopped,"
said Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Intimate Kid.
</P>
<P>
Roman Envoy, a minor stakes winner at Arlington International in Arlington
Heights, Ill., finished second, 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Formal Dinner, who
failed to win for the fifth time since taking the Sanford at Saratoga on Aug.
15. Intimate Kid wound up fourth, and Sondeed was last in the five-horse field.
</P>
<P>
Apollo, earning $46,050 for Harold and Diane Keith and Leon Rasmussen, his
breeders and owners, paid $2.60. After Apollo shook off Intimate Kid at the top
of the stretch, the only race left was for second place.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, a bloodlines expert who worked 50 years for the Daily Racing Form,
gives Apollo a chance to stretch out and eventually run the 1 1/4 miles of the
Kentucky Derby, but Jones remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
"On paper, they're telling me this horse can get the Derby distance, but I've
got to see it to believe it," said Jones, who plans to run Apollo in the
seven-furlong California Breeders' Champion Stakes on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, who rode Apollo to his first two victories, is sitting out a
weeklong suspension, and McCarron replaced him Friday. McCarron had been aboard
Apollo once for a workout at Hollywood Park. Jones said Desormeaux would regain
the mount.
</P>
<P>
After taking the Hollywood Park riding title, McCarron won three races on
opening day at Santa Anita and added three more Friday. Many horsemen thought
that he had come back too soon in August, two months after suffering broken
legs and a broken arm in a spill at Hollywood. McCarron still has a steel rod,
the diameter of about a penny, in his left leg, but he says there's no
lingering soreness or pain.
</P>
<P>
When McCarron was injured, he was running second to Gary Stevens in the
national money standings. Despite all the riding he missed, McCarron is still
likely to finish eighth in purses this year.
</P>
<P>
Apollo, who has the same name as the 1882 Kentucky Derby winner, is a mount
that McCarron will be sorry to lose. "He's as quick a horse as any that I've
ridden," he said after the San Miguel. "I asked him through the lane, because
he was gawking. The good thing about the race is that I never told him to run,
I just asked him. He was doing it easily."
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Keiths and Rasmussen campaigned another precocious horse. His name
was Secret, a son of Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"He was very talented," Rasmussen said. "But some place along the line, he lost
his courage. He ran in the race after Bates Motel won the Santa Anita Handicap
that year. I don't know what happened, but he was never any good after that."
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who turns 44 today, rode two winners earlier Friday and was
aboard Roman Envoy in the San Miguel. "I had a lot of horse coming down the
stretch, and Apollo just pulled away from me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides his speed, Jones likes Apollo's temperament. "He's got the right mind,"
Jones said. "The second time we worked him, before he ever raced, I knew he was
going to be a runner. He had a shin problem that slowed him down before he got
to the races. He's got the disposition of an old lead pony."
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of attitude a horse needs in early May, when more than 100,000
fans are jammed into Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby. Maybe it's about
time that Louisville had another Apollo win its famous race.
</P>

Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Jorge Velasquez, whose father-in-law died Thursday, has gone to Santo Domingo
in the Dominican Republic for the funeral and is not expected to ride again at
Santa Anita until Tuesday. . . . Nine 3-year-old fillies, including the Wayne
Lukas-trained entry of A Wild Ride and Chandelier, are entered for Sunday's
$100,000 La Brea Stakes. The others are She's a V.P., Mama Simba, Aishah,
Mahaska, Nasers Pride, Brought to Mind and Fly Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
Apollo accounted for a minus show pool of $8,720, which meant that the track
had to make up that amount to the bettors. . . . Santa Anita will run the San
Gabriel Handicap Monday and the Pasadena Breeders' Cup Tuesday. The track is
dark Wednesday before racing resumes Thursday.

A BARGAIN, AT ANY PRICE, DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT BIG A GAMBLE

In the race book at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last week, a horseplayer from
Los Angeles was able to make a $5,000 win bet at 2-1 odds in the Breeders' Cup
Mile, and he'll cash the ticket if any horse but Simply Majestic, Political
Ambition or Warning wins.
</P>
<P>
Strange things happen in those future-book horse parlors in Las Vegas. Months
before the Kentucky Derby this year, one of them was still quoting a price on a
horse that had died. In recent weeks, Houston was listed as one of the
favorites in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, even though trainer Wayne Lukas said
repeatedly that the colt wasn't going to run. In fact, Houston has undergone
knee surgery and is out for the year.
</P>
<P>
The expression caveat emptor -- let the buyer beware -- didn't originate at
Nevada sports books, but a sign with that Latin phrase ought to be posted in
every establishment.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, instead of bettors bucking the odds, some of them have an
excellent chance to beat the house, at least in the Mile, one of the seven
Breeders' Cup races Saturday at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
When Caesars opened its future book on the Breeders' Cup, odds were listed on
more than 50 horses that were candidates for the Mile on grass.
</P>
<P>
But when 20 horses were pre-entered with $20,000 payments 10 days ago, only
four of them -- Golden Opinion, Simply Majestic, Political Ambition and Warning
-- were on Caesars' 50-plus list. As a result, the other 16 went into a mutuel
field, which means that a bettor gets them all for just one bet.
</P>
<P>
Of those 16 horses, 11 are starting Saturday. Of the horses listed separately
by Caesars, Golden Opinion has been scratched and is a probable entrant in the
Yellow Ribbon Sunday at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, the second choice behind Zilzal in the Mile, wound up in Caesars'
mutuel field on a technicality. There was some money bet at the hotel on a
horse listed as "Steinlend," but because the name was misspelled, those bets
were canceled and Steinlen also became part of the multiple-horse field.
</P>
<P>
Vinnie Magliulo, the manager of the sports book at Caesars, confirmed what
happened to the hotel's future-book betting, except for the part about
Steinlen. "I heard some discussion about Steinlen the other day," Magliulo
said, "but I'm not sure."
</P>
<P>
Magliulo referred a reporter to the director of the race book, but he could not
be reached for comment. Magliulo said that after Breeders' Cup entries were
taken at Gulfstream Wednesday, the future book closed and regular betting on
the races began, with each horse a separate betting interest. After the $5,000
bet from Los Angeles was made on the mutuel field, those odds reportedly
dropped to even-money.
</P>
<P>
"We had people betting on those 50 or so horses for weeks," Magliulo said. "And
since most of them aren't running, we don't expect to get hurt on bets like the
one from L.A. That guy who bet the $5,000 has got a good bet, all right, but
the three horses he has to beat aren't exactly slouches."
</P>
<P>
At the time of the interview, Magliulo didn't know that Warning suffered a
bruised and swollen right foreleg on his trip here from Great Britain. He's
likely to be scratched, which would leave the Los Angeles bettor with only two
horses to beat.
</P>
<P>
In order to squeeze about 50,000 Breeders' Cup fans into a plant that seldom
has to accommodate more than 35,000, Gulfstream Park has installed temporary
seats in almost every available space. On the outside of the clubhouse turn,
for example, are portable bleachers that can seat several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
Some trainers are concerned that their horses might get spooked because they
will be unaccustomedly close to spectators Saturday, both in the paddock and
when they're on the track.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas was asked about the situation.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone has trouble with the crowds, it will be the horses that have been
running in New York," Lukas said, "because they're only used to running in
front of about 5,000 people."
</P>
<P>
Attendance hasn't dropped off to that extent at New York tracks, but Lukas
wasn't exaggerating by much.
</P>
<P>
The question that trainer Charlie Whittingham has been asked most often this
week is how the jockey switch from Pat Valenzuela to Chris McCarron will affect
Sunday Silence. Valenzuela lost the mount last week when Santa Anita stewards
suspended him for 60 days after a positive cocaine test.
</P>
<P>
Whittingham has come up with a stock answer to the question: "The change is
harder on Valenzuela than the horse."
</P>
<P>
The winning jockey's share of the the first-place purse in the Classic is
$135,000.
</P>
<P>
At one point, there was valid talk that the Classic was going to be a
three-horse race, with Blushing John threatening the big two of Easy Goer and
Sunday Silence, but Blushing John is being dismissed by many because of the
miserable race he ran in New Jersey on Oct. 13. Blushing John, who has won
stakes at Oaklawn Park, Pimlico, Hollywood Park and Arlington International
this year, finished ahead of only one horse in the Meadowlands Cup, losing to
Mi Selecto by 20 lengths. Now he is 8-1 on the morning line, behind Easy Goer,
Sunday Silence and Present Value.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dick Lundy is puzzled by Blushing John's Meadowlands race. "The only
thing I can figure is that I made a mistake by sending him from Belmont Park
over there for schooling the night before," Lundy said.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to get used to running at night, which he had never done before.
We could have vanned him back to Belmont after the schooling and then returned
him to the Meadowlands the night of the race, but we just kept him there. I
found out later that they leave the barn lights on all night at the
Meadowlands, and he couldn't handle that and only got about an hour and a half
of sleep. Then he had to wait all day before he ran.
</P>
<P>
"It may have made a difference, but if I didn't do what I did and he ran a bad
race, then I'd be second-guessing myself, anyway."
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream Park usually isn't open at this time of the year but was granted
permission by Florida to conduct the Breeders' Cup weekend, providing it paid a
penalty to Calder, a nearby track, which is shutting down for three days.
Calder reportedly is receiving $75,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Breeders' Cup this weekend, Gulfstream will run three stakes
Friday, three to open the Breeders' Cup program Saturday and three more Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Doyouseewhatisee, a California invader, is favored in the $100,000
Chief's Crown Stakes for 2-year-olds; Fieldy is the morning-line choice in the
$100,000 Very Subtle Stakes for fillies and mares, and Wanderkin is
high-weighted at 117 pounds in the $200,000 Theatrical Handicap on grass for
3-year-olds and up.
</P>
<P>
Turfah, on the also-eligible list for the Breeders' Cup Turf, is also entered
in the Theatrical.
</P>
<P>
Despite beating Nashwan at a time when he was considered to be the best horse
in Europe, Golden Pheasant could do no better than make the also-eligible list
for the Breeders' Cup Turf. Golden Pheasant, raced by owner Bruce McNall and
Wayne Gretzky of the Kings, ran 14th in the Arc de Triomphe after beating
Nashwan.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham hasn't saddled a horse here since he won the Gulfstream
Park Handicap with Pretense 22 years ago. . . . When Laffit Pincay rides Mi
Selecto in the Classic, he will be the eighth jockey this year on the
4-year-old colt, who is making his 13th start. . . . Cash Asmussen isn't riding
in the Breeders' Cup because of injuries.
