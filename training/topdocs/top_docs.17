REMEMBERING THE DAY LOU GEHRIG SAT DOWN

<P>
On June 2, 1925, Wally Pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in 
the New York Yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
It took 14 years, 2,130 games and an incurable illness to put Gehrig back on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Iron Horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago, on May 2, 
1939, he also moved out of the shadow of Babe Ruth and into baseball 
immortality. 
</P>
<P>
The shy son of German immigrants living on New York's East Side never captured 
the imagination of the public the way the flamboyant Ruth did, but when his 
remarkable consecutive-game streak ended he took with him numbers comparable to 
anyone who ever played the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 493 lifetime homers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1,990 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A .632 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A major-league record 23 grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1927, he hit .373 with 47 home runs and 175 runs batted in. He also had 
52 doubles, 18 triples, walked 109 times and scored 149 runs. Yet it was a 
season lost to Ruth's 60 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 13 full seasons he played, Gehrig averaged 147 RBIs a season. Henry 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle never drove in that many runs in a seeason 
even once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In four seasons during the peak of his career he averaged only 37 
strikeouts a year. Reggie Jackson averaged 129 strikeouts a season for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But it is his 2,130 consecutive games played that is considered one of 
baseball's unbreakable records. The next best is the mark Gehrig broke -- 1,307 
straight games by Everett Scott, 823 games (more than five seasons) short of 
Gehrig's mark. 
</P>
<P>
If a rookie was to start a consecutive-game streak in 1989, he would have to 
play every game from now until early in the season of 2,002 to surpass Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1939, no one has even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey holds the National League record with 1,207 consecutive games from 
Sept. 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey retired after the 1987 season, but if he had kept the streak going in 
1983 and was playing today, he would still be a few games short. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone will ever break Lou Gehrig's record," Garvey said. "I 
know I played with a lot of nagging injuries to keep the streak alive and I 
didn't even get close." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken recently surpassed playing in 1,100 consecutive 
games. He would still need another six-plus seasons to reach Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really something I'm thinking about," Ripken said. "I can't even 
imagine reaching that point. Hey, I'm surprised I've gotten this far. 
</P>
<P>
"I just play one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
A star at Columbia University, Gehrig was scouted by Paul Krichell and signed 
with the Yankees when offered a $1,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
After two short stints with New York in 1923 and 1924, Gehrig started his 
streak on that June day in 1925 when Pipp, who had been the Yankees' first 
baseman since 1915, told Manager Miller Huggins he had a headache and asked to 
take the day off. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig took over at first base, and stayed there for 15 years. He stayed 
through muscle pulls, broken bones, and yes, even a slump or two. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to .295 with 29 homers and 114 
RBIs. While million-dollar numbers by today's standards, it was far below his 
norm and provoked concern for Gehrig and the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig, whose top salary was $39,000, had a sluggish spring training in 1939 
and a routine play at Yankee Stadium in April told him something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A ball was hit back to pitcher Johnny Murphy and Gehrig had trouble getting to 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told the Iron Horse, "nice play," but Gehrig knew it was nothing 
special. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 28 at-bats in 1939, Gehrig had four hits with no homers and one 
RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig knew something was wrong, he just didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1939, was an off day and Gehrig spent some lonely hours in a Detroit 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gehrig told Manager Joe McCarthy: "I'm taking myself out of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
"I decided last Sunday night on this move," Gehrig said in announcing his 
decision to the press. "I haven't been a bit of good to the team since the 
season started. It would not be fair to the boys, to Joe or to the baseball 
public for me to try going on. In fact, it would not be fair to myself." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy thought Gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be 
back soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it would be as he wished," McCarthy said at the time. "Like 
everybody else I'm sorry to see it happen. I told him not to worry. Maybe the 
warm weather will bring him around." 
</P>
<P>
But the weather had nothing to do with Gehrig's problems. 
</P>
<P>
He visited the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and it was discovered he had an 
incurable disease. He was diagnosed as having Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
But the world has come to know it as Lou Gehrig's disease.

"I was there," said former Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen. "But sometimes it 
doesn't seem real now. There was a real Lou Gehrig. A guy who joked with his 
teammates and argued at bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
"But after his last game, he became a legend." 
</P>
<P>
Others have had great numbers, but few more impact on the game of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first time I played first base at Yankee Stadium thinking I was 
in the same place Lou Gehrig played," first baseman Don Mattingly said. "It 
almost gave me chills." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Stadium is the "House that Ruth Built," but as long as a team plays 
there, Gehrig will be the pride of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen, "He's what made wearing a Yankee uniform special."

   Iron man Lou Gehrig will be featured on a new
commemorative postage stamp this summer, the Postal Service reported
Tuesday.
   The stamp honoring the former New York Yankees hitter will be
issued June 10 at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Gehrig played a record 2,130 consecutive games, batting cleanup
behind slugger Babe Ruth in the Yankees' famous ``Murderer's Row''
lineup.
   During his career, Gehrig hit 493 home runs, driving in 100 or
more runs 13 seasons in a row and batting .340 lifetime.
   Gehrig took the field for the Yankees June 2, 1925, and didn't
miss a game until May 2, 1939, after he was diagnosed as suffering
from the fatal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. That disease
has since come to be known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

MORNING BRIEFING: PRESS DIDN'T GRASP GEHRIG'S IRON STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago this week, Lou Gehrig ended a remarkable string of playing in 
2,130 consecutive games, from June 1, 1925 to May 2, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Gehrig was discovered to have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
the incurable ailment now known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
But before the world knew what ailed the New York Yankees' Iron Horse, he was 
an inviting target for sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper accounts of Gehrig's dramatic demise were at first attributed to old 
age. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Iron Horse Not What He Used to Be," said a headline in the Sporting News 
in June 1938. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter covering the Yankees for the now-defunct New York World Telegram 
wrote that the first baseman "cannot get the old swing, he cannot put the old 
driving power on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
And from the New York Times: "After all, the Iron Horse is getting old, he is 
always doing his best and it isn't exactly sporty to ride a fellow merely 
because the years have caught up with him." 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig was 35 in 1938. He died in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the first commissioner of the American Basketball Assn.? 
</P>
<P>
Food for thought: Ever wonder who came up with the idea of dragging the infield 
after the fifth inning? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it began in the Pacific Coast League in 1949, when Manager Fred Haney of 
the Hollywood Stars decided fans would buy more concessions if there was a 
10-minute break in the middle of a game. Haney came up with the brainstorm 
while pondering a suggestion from concessions chief Danny Goodman on how to 
boost business. 
</P>
<P>
Re-lighting the flame: When Seattle acquired pitcher Mike Dunne from Pittsburgh 
last week, the Mariners became the first team in the majors with three members 
of the 1984 U.S. Olympic baseball team. Dunne rejoined pitchers Scott Bankhead 
and Bill Swift. 
</P>
<P>
Now you really know Dept.: April 30's Morning Briefing said the diameter of a 
golf hole is 4 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, writes Gerald E. Hall, rules chairman of the Southern California PGA. 
From Robert Clark's book, "Golf -- A Royal and Ancient Game," comes this 1899 
rule: "The hole shall be 4 1/4 inches in diameter, and at least 4 inches deep." 
</P>
<P>
Missed by just this much. 
</P>
<P>
Now you really know Dept. II: April 29's trivia said Dwight D. Eisenhower 
suffered a broken leg trying to tackle Jim Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kenneth S. Davis' biography, "Eisenhower, Soldier of Democracy," 
the Army football player suffered a twisted knee in the game won by Thorpe and 
Carlisle, 27-6, during the 1912 season. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, writes reader Al Ginepra, Eisenhower suffered a broken knee in a 
game against Tufts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was seriously hurt," Davis' book said. "He knew that as soon as it 
happened. The knee that he twisted in the Carlisle game was now broken, and he 
lay flat on the ground, gritting his teeth and clawing the turf in agony." 
</P>
<P>
But even in that moment of great pain Eisenhower was concerned whether he would 
be able to get back in shape for the Navy game. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't, though, since he was out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: George Mikan. 
</P>
<P>
Action Jackson: Bo Jackson receives so many accolades about his versatility 
that sometimes you've got to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive Kansas City Royal-Los Angeles Raider might have even done a 
double-take over this one: 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know how good he is?" a scout asked the Washington Post's Richard 
Justice, who then told this apocryphal anecdote: "I saw him hit a ball to deep 
center field. He ran out and caught it, then turned around and beat his own 
throw back to the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, right. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: "If Easy Goer could look me in the eye and say, 'I'm gonna win (the 
Kentucky Derby),' I wouldn't run (Awe Inspiring)," trainer Shug McGaughey said. 
"But he can't do that. He's doing fantastic, but who knows?"

<LEADPARA>  If he were playing this season, the Iron Horse would easily surpass the Rocket
on payday.;    So says a study released Tuesday by two University of Dayton
economics professors, who theorize that Lou Gehrig's performance and years of
service would make him deserving of the highest salary in baseball history if
he played in today's market.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IN GEHRIG'S WILDEST DREAMS
HIS '91 SALARY: $7.8 MILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It is probably impossible to ever objectively rank the all-time players on
the basis of their pure baseball athletic skills, but if a player with Lou
Gehrig's statistical capabilities emerged in the 1991 baseball labor market,
he should be the highest-paid player," said Lawrence Hadley, one of the
study's authors.;    Hadley and Elizabeth Gustafson calculated that Gehrig
would command an annual salary of more than $7.8 million in today's market.
Pitcher Walter Johnson would be second, earning more than $7.5 million per
year.;    Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger "The Rocket" Clemens is the
highest-paid player today, earning an average of $5.38 million a year.;    The
two researchers studied the records of 150 hitters and 100 pitchers,
calculating what the players would earn if they were free agents in the prime
of their careers and were rewarded for their performance and longevity at the
same rate as today's players.;    Third on the list was Babe Ruth at $7.5
million, followed by Jimmie Foxx, $7.3 million, and Cy Young, $7.1 million.  </TEXT>

LEGACY OF EARNING POWER;

<P>
BABE RUTH: DEAD 41 YEARS, HE LIVES ON IN ENDORSEMENTS THAT BRING HEIRS HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the potential Babe Ruth would have in today's 
every-athlete-has-a-sneaker-deal endorsement market. 
</P>
<P>
He could rival Bo Jackson -- "Babe knows baseball. . . . Babe knows hot dogs" 
-- hawk Hertz with Arnie and O. J., look lumpy in his Hanes with Boomer 
Esiason, pitch Slimfast diets with Lasorda and take sides in the Miller Lite 
"Less filling! Tastes Great!" debate. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Ruth is not doing shabbily. Forty-one years after his death, Ruth's 
name and visage are licensed to more than 100 companies and products -- banks, 
car companies, retailers, trading card firms, teddy bears, and a maker of 
trapping knives -- avidly trying to profit from his powerful, mythic and 
mischievous appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bambino is earning wealth for his heirs that, given his own commercial 
bent, surely wouldn't have surprised the man who did not break stride when told 
his $80,000 salary exceeded President Hoover's. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which celebrity worship is at its height, stars such as the Babe 
cannot commit the ultimate no-no of endorsement deals: getting in trouble. 
Though the Babe was known to imbibe, smoke and carouse, his conduct is now 
impeccable. Through the selective filter of hero worship, the Babe's image is 
as clean as Orel Hershiser's. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that trend the expanding market for baseball memorabilia, and it's easy 
to see why the most popular player in the sport's history remains its most 
durable commercial symbol. 
</P>
<P>
So, whether he endorses IBM personal computers, sneakers, free checking for 
senior citizens at a Philadelphia bank, Zenith power supplies or the 
Hewlett-Packard sales force, Babe Ruth stands for whatever the paying company 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
"The legend of Babe Ruth is a very tangible thing," said Mark Roesler, 
president of Curtis Management Group, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing 
agent. "Babe's image as the ultimate power hitter, the ultimate superstar isn't 
going to change. (Roger) Maris hit 61 homers, but the Babe's image will never 
change. He's achieved his place in history. Current players have not." 
</P>
<P>
Roesler said that fees paid to the Ruth family, including his surviving 
daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, and his two daughters' children, and Babe Ruth 
Baseball Inc., were estimated at $400,000 for 1989 and are expected to grow to 
at least $1 million in 1990. Roesler said that before Curtis took control of 
the Ruth marketing from Babe Ruth Baseball in 1984, annual fees amounted to 
less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
How would the Babe do if he returned in the pot-bellied flesh? 
</P>
<P>
Not badly, but he'd have more competition in a more active market. And he would 
risk being a disaster to those who would hire him as their spokesman if his 
personal excesses were as probed and criticized as those of today's stars. 
</P>
<P>
But if he controlled himself, he might outdo everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Said Daisy Sinclair, casting director for the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising 
agency: "I can't think of a category around that he wouldn't fit into, except 
Weight Watchers. He could do ads for vitamins because looking at him, you 
wonder how he could do what he did." 
</P>
<P>
When Ruth was the highest-paid player in baseball, the endorsement game was 
small. He got around more than any other star, endorsing a hat, a brand of 
cigar -- he puffed on them in the showroom window of the factory -- chewing 
tobacco, long johns, shoes, a watch and autographed balls given away by Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
He also backed the short-lived Babe Ruth's Home Run Candy, which lost a legal 
fight with the makers of the Baby Ruth candy bar -- named not for the Babe, but 
for Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth -- and a Manhattan haberdashery, Babe 
Ruth's for Men, that shut its doors in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercialization was so much less then," said Robert Creamer, author of 
"Babe: The Legend Comes to Life," the definitive 1974 biography of Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it strikes me as something weird that a man dead 40 years can be a live 
property. But it's obvious that he's a recognizable personality and a 
plus-person -- that is, someone you'd like to see here now." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of marketers evidently think the Babe is worth the price of seeing him, 
if not in person, in two dimensions. You want the Babe for a one-time ad in a 
newspaper? That will be $500. You want to put the Babe in a national print 
campaign? Pay $15,000, please. Now you want the Babe in a national multi-media 
campaign? Well, that will be $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
What do marketers want from Babe Ruth? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Power: For a Sears Business Centers campaign, the retailer paid about 
$10,000 to feature Ruth in its "heavy hitters" advertising series to sell 
several makes of personal computers. The ads -- with retouched photos of the 
Babe holding or using PCs -- noted that the products were "marked down to 
prices in your ballpark. All heavy hitters . . . Not bad, huh, Babe?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- History: For the marketers at United Valley Bank in Philadelphia, Ruth's 
image, teamed with that of teammate Lou Gehrig, provided a touchstone for its 
target group: depositors 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're old enough to remember them, you can forget about paying for 
checking," said the slogan, above a posed shot of Ruth and Gehrig before the 
Yankee Stadium backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inspiration: The Carlson Marketing Group's motivation division used Ruth's 
image and his words -- "Baseball is a great teacher" -- on a poster to gussy up 
a baseball-oriented incentive program designed for computer sales forces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dependability: Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. featured a photo of Ruth's 
"called shot" in the 1932 World Series against Chicago Cub pitcher Charlie Root 
to illustrate reliability. 
</P>
<P>
"A promise made, a promise kept," read the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Chattanooga cutlery maker Jim Frost produces a series of commemorative trapping 
knives named for Ruth, Gehrig and Ty Cobb. They are encased in walnut music 
boxes that play "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frost: "This is the era of name recognition, and we've gone this route to 
promote our merchandise. On the Ruth knife, we have an etching of him on the 
blade and an authorization slip that tells some of his history. We limit 
production to 3,000 pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Management Group has carved a specialty out of marketing celebrities. 
Besides Ruth, Gehrig and Cobb, Curtis' sports clientele -- featuring 27 Hall of 
Famers -- includes Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Casey Stengel, Bob Feller, 
Vince Lombardi, Jim Thorpe and Jesse Owens. Its entertainment- and 
historical-figure roster features James Dean, Fred Astaire, Humphrey Bogart, 
Mark Twain and Amelia Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a baseball legend wanted by marketers is out of Curtis' realm. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff Stevens, merchandising director of the Baseball Hall of Fame: "If 
something we're doing is beyond the scope of the agreement the Hall of Famers 
have directly with the Hall for products we sell in our gift shop or through 
our catalogue, we go to Curtis. In fact, we're doing a series of 1991 calendars 
that use only Curtis clients." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has been especially active in the last year, increasing its stable of 
baseball clients to about 30 former players. 
</P>
<P>
The year just past was the biggest yet for Lou Gehrig licensing, because of the 
50th anniversary of his emotional retirement from baseball and Major League 
Baseball's dedication of the season to the ALS Foundation, which raises funds 
to research a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven companies are "Iron Horse" licensees, many for products tied to 
the U.S. Postal Service's issue of a Gehrig stamp last June. 
</P>
<P>
Some estates restrict what the legends can sell. 
</P>
<P>
In Ruth's case, his daughters have barred liquor and tobacco ads. 
</P>
<P>
In Gehrig's case, said Roesler: "We respect Eleanor Gehrig's wish not to use 
Lou Gehrig for fund-raising purposes. He's not licensed for any ALS research 
group except the one at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (the Eleanor and 
Lou Gehrig ALS Center), though we allowed the ALS Foundation to do a few 
specific things this year." 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Gehrig left her estate and the rights to market her husband to the 
medical center, which derived a six-figure licensing income this year. 
</P>
<P>
Properties such as Ruth and Gehrig, valuable in life and death, are protected. 
Curtis has 18 infringement suits pending, including a protracted action against 
Macmillan Publishing Co. over an engagement calendar that Curtis alleges 
illegally used a photograph of Ruth; and two against card collector firms for 
alleged unauthorized use of the images of 10 of its players on card sets. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity representatives are gaining more protection because of new state laws 
that grant the dead stars' exclusive licensing rights to their heirs for a 
specified number of years. For example, California's 1985 law grants the heirs 
licensing rights for 50 years after a celebrity's death; Oklahoma's term is 100 
years, Nevada's 50 and Tennessee's 10. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the 50-year bell tolls on Babe Ruth in 1998, there are other legal 
ways to protect his name and likeness. Curtis has secured trademark protection 
in categories such as paper goods, gifts, apparel and footwear that will 
protect the family's rights as long as their legacy's name and image stay in 
continual use. 
</P>
<P>
So as long as the Ruth legend remains a never-dying part of the magic and lore 
of baseball, it seems clear that marketers will turn to him when they want to 
ally their product or message with his ever-living mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at today's players: most have professional credibility, but not the 
extra spark of charisma," said Marty Blackman, who advises corporations on the 
use of personalities in commercials. "But when you look for a spokesman, you 
want professional credibility, which Ruth had with his hitting and home runs; 
and charisma, which he really had. He's one of those people who rose to the top 
and just stayed there."

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis Day, a singer who served as
comic foil for Jack Benny on television and radio shows, was
hospitalized in critical condition today with a brain injury, an
official said.
   ``He's showing signs of improvement day by day, and we're taking
it day by day,'' publicist Kitty Davis said Friday. ``He's showing
signs of response.''
   Day, 71, a tenor known for his recordings of Irish ballads such
as ``Danny Boy,'' was diagnosed last July as having amyotropic
lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The
progressive nerve disorder causes a loss in muscle control.
   But Day wasn't hospitalized until he fell and hit his head at
his Bel Air-area home Wednesday, said Armen Markarian, spokesman
for St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   His condition was critical early today, and he remained under
close observation, according to a nursing supervisor.
   Day complained of a severe headache while he was being examined
in the hospital emergency room early Wednesday, Markarian said.
Tests showed bleeding in the brain and he was taken to surgery,
Markarian said.
   ``He's been in critical condition since then,'' the spokesman
added.
   Day was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City. His singing
career began in 1939 as a naive kid with a golden voice on Jack
Benny's radio show.
   One of his trademark lines was a sprightly ``Gee, Mr. Benny!''
   He recorded a number of songs, such as ``Peg of My Heart'' and
``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and he also appeared in several films,
including ``Buck Benny Rides Again,'' ``Music in Manhattan,'' ``One
Sunday Afternoon'' and ``The Girl Next Door.''
   During a vacation in Hawaii last year, Day became aware of a
muscle-control problem and returned to the Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla, where doctors diagnosed Lou Gehrig's disease.
   He was confined to a wheelchair during recent months, Ms. Davis
said, but he made regular appearances at Irish fairs and benefits
for medical research.

<LEADPARA>  Doctors today said they are closing in on the faulty gene that causes Lou
Gehrig's disease. The discovery brings scientists closer to understanding the
fatally crippling illness and, eventually, reversing it.;    Two teams of
scientists working together believe they have narrowed the search for the gene
to just 10 million bits on part of chromosome 21. The body's blueprint is
carried on 23 chromosomes containing a total of 3 billion bits.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GEHRIG'S DISEASE TRACKED
DOCTORS CLOSING IN ON THE FAULTY GENE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The scientists hope someday to isolate the culprit gene, figure out how it
goes wrong and then design treatments to correct the defect.;    But doctors
cautioned that they are still far from a cure.;    'Unraveling the mysteries';
 The findings "represent an important first step in unraveling the mysteries
of this well-studied, but little-understood disorder," wrote Dr. P. Michael
Conneally of Indiana University in an editorial published with the study in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.;    Until now, Lou Gehrig's disease
-- what doctors call amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS -- has been an
almost complete mystery. No one knows its cause or how to stop or even slow
its progression.;    "This is an important first step toward developing a
treatment for ALS," said Dr. Lawrence Z. Stern, research director of the
Muscular Dystrophy Association, which helped finance the research.;    The
disease, named for the New York Yankees slugger, strikes about 5,000 Americans
a year, and patients typically die within five years. It destroys nerve cells
in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in muscle wasting, paralysis and
death.;    The latest research was directed by Dr. Teepu Siddique of
Northwestern University.;    "This is a difficult disease," said Siddique. "A
hundred years of research has not yielded a clue as to what causes the disease
or how to treat it. This is the first time that we have a handle on the
disease.";    Pooled information;  Two research groups -- one at Duke
University, where Siddique worked until recently, and the other at
Massachusetts General Hospital -- pooled their information on 510 members of
23 families in which the disease was inherited.;    Only 5 percent to 10
percent of cases of Lou Gehrig's disease are thought to run in families.
Researchers believe both the inherited and the apparently random forms of the
illness involve the same damage to nerve cells. However, the random type may
result from a toxin or some other damage, as well as a faulty gene.;    No one
knows how long it will take to pinpoint the gene responsible for the disease.
But when that happens, scientists should be able to figure out what faulty
protein underlies the disease.  </TEXT>

'89 YANKEES EVEN FALL SHY OF 1925 TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By OWEN CANFIELD, The Hartford Courant

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1925, Miller Huggins' New York Yankees were on their way to a seventh-place 
finish. At one point, the Yankees fell 18 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Yankees of Manager Bucky Dent (well, at least he was manager when this 
newspaper went to press) repose 14 games behind the American League 
East-leading Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee fans may draw some comfort from that. But look closely. There is no 
comfort there. The '89 Yanks have equaled a record for futility, but they are 
by no means the equal of the '25 club. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
This Yankee team has descended to an intolerable position. It is duller than 50 
gallons of dishwater. Poor play and losing go in cycles. Eventually, the 
Yankees will be up again. But because of the tension, instability and panicky 
disorganization that exists throughout, it may take many years. 
</P>
<P>
But dullness is unforgivable in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanks of 1989 will avoid last place only because of the Detroit Tigers, who 
have died this season of natural causes. The Yankees have been murdered by 
their owner and their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
The 1925 team finished 69-85. Yankee fans stayed away. After drawing more than 
1 million fans for five consecutive seasons, attendance fell to 697,000. But 
dullness was not a problem. Huggins was in the middle of an 11 1/2-year tenure. 
Before George Steinbrenner, a Yankee manager's position was relatively safe as 
long as he did the job. Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk all 
managed 10 years or more, although Houk's term was divided in two parts, ending 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
One difference between the Yankees of 1925 and 1989 is the difference between 
Miller Huggins and Bucky Dent. Huggins was tough, seasoned and in full command. 
Dent is hanging timidly around until the ax connects with his fully exposed 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Yanks don't have hope. Isn't that awful? No hope. Only dullness and 
certain uncertainty. They lost 19-5 to the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 1925 Yanks allowed 19 runs in a game, too, losing 19-1 to Detroit in 
mid-June. But they were only pausing to pull their feet out of the mud during 
that season and everyone knew it. In the next three years, they would win three 
pennants and two world championships. 
</P>
<P>
June 1, 1925 was a significant date for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
It was on that day that Lou Gehrig replaced Wally Pipp at first base. Some 
2,130 games later, the Iron Horse came out of the lineup. It was also the day 
Babe Ruth was inserted into the Yankee lineup for his first game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press ignored Gehrig but reported this on Ruth in The Courant on 
June 2: "In the clean-up position of the Yankees batting order again after 
almost two months' confinement to a hospital with influenza and indigestion, 
Ruth's opening successes were limited to fielding features." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Johnson was pitching that day for the first-place Washington Senators, 
who in October would lose the World Series in seven games to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth would play 98 games, hit 25 homers and drive in 66 runs in his curtailed 
season. That was expected. Gehrig had played 13 games for the Yanks in 1923 and 
10 in 1924. No one could forsee his magnificant baseball future when he 
replaced Pipp on that day. But in the ensuing 126 games he hit 20 homers and 
knocked in 68 runs, batting .295. Oh, these Yankees had hope all right. 
</P>
<P>
The next year they had a rookie second baseman, Tony "Poosh 'em Up" Lazzeri, 
who was ready. He played 155 games. Ruth hit 47 homers, Gehrig 16 with 107 RBI. 
Leadoff man Earle Combs had a solid season and the pitching, anchored by 
veteran Herb Pennock (23-11), was sound as a 1925 gold piece. The Yanks won 91, 
lost 63 and although they lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals and 
39-year-old Grover Cleveland Alexander, the dynasty was reestablished. 
</P>
<P>
The next season they won 110, and the next 101. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Yankees are sliding more and more rapidly backward. They have some fine 
players -- Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Bob Geren, Dave Righetti, Roberto Kelly, 
Jesse Barfield -- but they don't have hope. It is not a team that can hope for 
anything except avoiding the cellar this year, and little else next. 1990 will 
not be like 1926 for the Yankees. They don't have the weapons or the will to 
make the needed commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Too much trouble. Too much Steinbrenner. Too much dullness. Shame, shame, 
shame.

PICKING THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THE MYSTERIES OF THE MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Neuro-: Life on the Frontlines of Brain Surgery and Neurological Medicine by 
David Noonan (Simon and Schuster: $19.95; 233 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The human brain is the most distinguishing part of our body, the most 
fascinating, and probably the least understood. Unlike the other organs, the 
brain's product -- mind -- cannot be directly observed. The pancreas secretes 
insulin; does the brain secrete thoughts? If so, where are they? 
</P>
<P>
The link between brain and mind is very poorly understood. Yet doctors who 
treat the brain organically -- neurologists and neurosurgeons -- are frequently 
able to help their patients. "Neuro-" by David Noonan is the story of who they 
are and how they do it. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan, a Los Angeles writer, approaches his subject from the doctors' point of 
view and from the patients'. The chapters on brain surgery and brain surgeons 
are the best. To do research for them, he interviewed the surgeons and observed 
them at work. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The brain exposed. Light falls on its gleaming surface for the first time. It 
beats lightly, steadily. It is pink and gray, the brain, and covered with tiny 
blood vessels, in a web. In some openings you can see the curve of the brain, 
its roundness. It does not look strong, it looks very soft, soft enough for you 
to push your finger through. When you see it for the first time, you almost 
expect sparks arcing across the surface of the cortex, blinking lights, the 
crackle of an idea. You stare down at it, and it gives nothing back, reveals 
nothing, gives no hint of how it works." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident Practitioners 
</P>
<P>
The reader learns that practitioners in this field are supremely confident of 
their knowledge and their skills and their ability to make the right decisions 
in difficult situations. "Brain surgeons cut people's heads open," Noonan 
writes. A simple but startling statement. 
</P>
<P>
He has great affection and admiration for these doctors who do this work, and 
that comes through loud and clear. He is also aware of the difficult and 
unusual position that doctors -- particularly surgeons -- are in. Noonan is 
very perceptive about this. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons must care about their patients, but they cannot become emotionally 
involved with them. The patient's condition is part of the job, and it must 
always remain part of the job: 
</P>
<P>
"What is all new and strange to the patients and his family is old and familiar 
to the surgeon," Noonan writes. "The patient rightly considers his brain tumor 
to be the most important brain tumor that ever existed, while the doctor knows 
that the patient's brain tumor is one of many a doctor will have to confront 
over the course of his career." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neurological Problems 
</P>
<P>
While the first half of the book deals with doctors and patients and the 
relationship between the two, the second half deals in detail with three 
serious neurological problems: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's 
disease), which affects movement; aphasia, which affects speech, and 
schizophrenia, which affects thought. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the book is less successful than the first. It has a padded 
feeling. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease, for example, contains an extended 
discussion of Lou Gehrig's baseball career. The chapter on schizophrenia 
includes a seemingly endless diatribe against frontal lobotomies, which were 
extensively performed in this country from 1935 to 1960 as a treatment for 
mental illness. These chapters are more descriptions of diseases than "life on 
the frontlines of brain surgery and neurological medicine," which, after all, 
is the subtitle of the book. 
</P>
<P>
But they do have some value. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease includes a 
profile of Lance Meagher, a physician who has lived with ALS for 13 years and, 
though virtually paralyzed, continues in limited practice and is making plans 
to fly solo around the world. Meagher is probably the most interesting person 
Noonan presents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing the Soul 
</P>
<P>
At the very end of the book, in a short chapter appropriately titled 
"Conclusion," Noonan voices his only reservations about the doctors who work on 
the brain. By restricting their activity to the flesh, he says, they are 
missing the soul. Doctors treat the body but not the mind. Emotions are more 
than the sum total of complicated electrochemical firings in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Noonan says, "love is a chemical reaction, but there is more to it than 
that. There is, I believe, something beyond biology, and it is a factor, 
somehow, in the function of every living human cell and in every human thought 
and deed. In a sense, the human nervous system is a complex set of conditions 
necessary for the existence of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
This assertion, on the book's penultimate page, comes out of the blue. It does 
not follow from what has come before, and Noonan has hardly raised the 
question, much less prepared the reader for his conclusion.

<HEAD>Photographer Eliot Porter Dies, Known for Sierra Club Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Color photography pioneer Eliot Porter,
best known for his large-format books published by the Sierra Club,
has died at age 88.
   Porter died Friday at St. Vincent Hospital of cardiac arrest. He
had been hospitalized since Oct. 27 for treatment of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
   Porter was born Dec. 6, 1901, in Winnetka, Ill., and had lived
in Tesuque, N.M., since the mid-1940s.
   He earned a medical degree from Harvard and conducted bacterial
research there before turning his interest in photography into a
career.
   ``I don't think that he saw any difference between art and
science,'' said Jim Bones, who was Porter's assistant in the 1970s.
   ``If you look at history, the great artists were also great
scientists, like (Leonardo) da Vinci, for example,'' Bones said.
   Porter was first recognized for his photographs of birds, and
perhaps bestknown for ``Birds of North America - A Personal
Selection.''
   Two books featuring his work, ``Mexican Celebration'' and
``Nature's Chaos,'' were released last week, said David Scheinbaum,
owner of the Scheinbaum &amp; Russek Gallery of Photography in Santa
Fe.
   ``He is, beyond a doubt, the father of color photography as an
art form,'' Scheinbaum said. ``There is a whole generation of young
photographers who are following in his footsteps.''
   Porter, whose work was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York City, donated hundreds of prints to the University
of New Mexico and the Fine Arts Museum in Santa Fe, said Beaumont
Newhall, a photography historian and former UNM professor.
   Porter took his last photograph in 1986, the same year he was
diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.
   He is survived by his wife Aline and five sons.

JIM MURRAY: MARSHALL'S MET TALE IS A PIPP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
I guess the most telling argument for the advisability of playing in pain is 
the Lou Gehrig story. Every schoolboy knows it. About when the New York Yankee 
first baseman, Wally Pipp, came down with a headache or a cold or some other 
minor infirmity and requested the day off from his chores at the stadium. 
Yankee Manager Miller Huggins put a young rookie in his place. Fellow named Lou 
Gehrig. Lou stayed there for 2,130 consecutive games or 14 seasons. Wally Pipp 
drifted out of the league and out of baseball. And his name became synonymous 
with a guy who got upstaged by an understudy and never got back in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
Players learned to play hurt. The name Wally Pipp went into the language, 
symbolizing guys who didn't have sense enough to say, "I feel fine, Skip," even 
if they had a fever of 104 and chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lou Gehrig, herself, was later to claim there was really nothing seriously 
wrong with Wally Pipp that day except he wasn't hitting and thought the day off 
might do him some good. So, he went to the race track. 
</P>
<P>
I bring this up because another first baseman, Mike Marshall of the Mets, is 
probably beginning to get an idea what Wally Pipp felt like. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever been able to figure Mike Marshall out. A manager looks at him 
and all he can see is a pennant -- 6-feet-5, power to all fields. He has 25 
home runs and 100 runs batted in written all over him. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers sure thought he was going to be their next super star. Right after 
they signed him, he batted .373 and hit 34 home runs and knocked in 137 runs at 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't call Mike Marshall smooth. He just kind of surrounded the ball in 
the field, and he kind of clanked up to the plate like something that might 
need oil. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a lot of people thought the Dodgers should have just handed him a mitt 
and the first baseman's job when he came up and then forgot about it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Dodgers experimented with the Greg Brocks, Sid Breams, even Pedro 
Guerreros at first base. They tossed Mike Marshall out in right field, where he 
played creditably enough, but where he sometimes looked like a bear on roller 
skates. His throwing arm was strong, if adventurous. 
</P>
<P>
But the real trouble with Mike Marshall was that you just couldn't keep him in 
the lineup. He became Baseball's Fabulous Invalid. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't as if Mike had these nice, glamorous, real he-man injuries, things 
like a broken collarbone from crashing into a fence in pursuit of a line drive 
or a cracked rib from a fastball or a rotator cuff from a hard throw. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall got these hard-to-diagnose, mysterious ailments, un-findable and, in 
some cases, untreatable. Back spasms, neck sprains. 
</P>
<P>
Back spasms are usually something a player comes up with on nights Dwight 
Gooden is going to pitch. Marshall's were a little less predictable. He came up 
with one once in the fourth game of the World Series, no less. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time he took himself out of the lineup because of a -- a 
little fanfare, please, professor -- wart! 
</P>
<P>
Now, wait just a darned minute! said Baseball. Give me that again?! Did you say 
"wart?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, in Mike's case, it was a little bit more complicated than that. It 
usually is. After all the clubhouse jokes telling him to stop playing with 
frogs, it developed that the "wart" was symptomatic of a nerve disorder. He 
needed an operation. 
</P>
<P>
He needed an operation on his toes, too. Nerves had bunched up between the 
third and fourth toes of his left foot. While it was a very real injury, it 
didn't sound that serious. Guerrero, who had moved to third base to make room 
for Marshall in the outfield, wanted to fight him. His other teammates, while 
more polite, were no more friendly. Marshall sat alone on trips, not exactly 
shunned but not exactly courted, either. He kept to himself. He couldn't 
understand what the fuss was. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the disabled list five times in four years. He occasionally skipped 
games or took himself out of the lineup after an inning in pain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finally gave up. They packaged Marshall with Alejandro Pena and 
traded him to New York for Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was agreeable. A new environment, a new lineup -- and he wouldn't have 
to face Gooden -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it was the same old back. Marshall came up to the manager a 
couple of weeks ago. He was hurting. Perhaps, if they put someone else in for 
the night -- or until the pain went . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Mets put Dave Magadan, their all-purpose infielder, on first base that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
He's still there. The Mets have spurted toward first place. With the club 
heading into the All-Star break, Dave Magadan is hitting .364 (to Marshall's 
.241). He has three homers, seven doubles and three triples. But mostly, he has 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall can't understand it. "I have been doing my exercises at the gym 
religiously, working out and am in good shape. I've got to play," he said as he 
sat in the Mets' locker room the other afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He has demanded the Mets trade him. "When you ask for a trade, they either have 
to give it to you or you become a free agent at the end of the season," 
Marshall said. "I have told them I want to be traded. But I don't understand 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Pipp could explain it to him. Magadan might be there till the next century.

<TEXT>
   John Dale ``Johnny'' Sylvester, who became
the most famous little sick boy in America after Babe Ruth promised
to smack a World Series homer for him _ and hit three _ has died 63
years later. He was 74.
   Sylvester died Monday at a Mineola hospital. No cause of death
was given.
   In 1926, Sylvester was suffering from a serious infection of the
forehead caused by a kick from a horse when he told his father, ``I
wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a homer before I die.''
   The family sent telegrams to the New York Yankees while they
were playing in St. Louis. Back came an airmail package containing
two baseballs, one autographed by the St. Louis Cardinals, the
other signed by several Yankees, including Ruth, who wrote, ``I'll
knock a homer for you on Wednesday.''
   Ruth hit three that day. In a follow-up note the day of Game 6,
Ruth said he would ``try to knock you another homer, maybe two
today,'' but went homerless. He hit one in Game 7 but it was not
enough to prevent the Yankees from losing the Series. In fact, Ruth
was caught stealing for the final out.
   Ruth visited the Essex Fells, N.J., boy at his bedside after the
Series, a meeting at which Sylvester remarked, ``I'm sorry the
Yanks lost.''
   No miraculous recovery occurred, but the visit certainly did no
harm. It took Sylvester three years before he fully recovered.
Sylvester returned the gesture in 1948, visiting Ruth four months
before the slugger died of cancer.
   The 1926 episode later was part of the movie ``The Babe Ruth
Story,'' but the screen version stretched the truth by having Ruth
make his home run promise at Sylvester's hospital bedside. The boy
apparently was never hospitalized.
   Earlier, in the 1942 movie ``The Pride of the Yankees,''
Hollywood had stretched the tale even further with a promise of two
home runs by Lou Gehrig.
   Sylvester served in the Navy in World War II and was later
president of Amscomatic Inc., a manufacturer of packing machinery.
   He is survived by his son, John Jr., a sister, Ruth Elliott of
Barrington R.I., and a brother, Horace C. Sylvester Jr., of
Osterville, Mass.

   Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y., said its
treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis received orphan
drug status by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The biotechnology company said the drug candidate, ciliary
neurotrophic factor, has been shown in animal studies to
promote the survival of motor neuron cells that degenerate
and die in people with ALS, which is commonly known as Lou
Gehrig's disease. Sponsors of orphan drugs receive seven
years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. if they are the

<TEXT>
   Robert Webber, a prolific character actor
whose face was as recognizable as his name was unknown, has died
from Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 64, and had been ill since last
fall.
   Featured in hundreds of television episodes and dozens of
feature films, Webber most recently played roles including Cybill
Shepherd's father in ``Moonlighting'' and the prosecutor in the
1987 Barbra Streisand film ``Nuts.''
   He died Wednesday at his home, his agent, Mary Oreck, said
Friday. Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is
a progressive degeneration of the nerve cells that govern muscular
movement.
   The sharp-featured, silver-haired actor, who often played
tainted businessmen and elegant crooks, said he had appeared in
more than 400 television roles when he stopped counting them in the
early 1960s.
   Webber was a well-known presence in television shows such as
``The Rockford Files,'' ``Cannon,'' ``Kojak,'' ``The Streets of San
Francisco,'' ``McCloud,'' ``Barnaby Jones,'' ``Quincy'' and
``Mannix.''
   His film credits included ``Twelve Angry Men,'' ``Harper,''
``The Dirty Dozen,'' ``Revenge of the Pink Panther,'' ``10,''
``Private Benjamin'' and ``S.O.B.''
   Born in Santa Ana, Webber was the son of a merchant seaman and
made his first stage appearance in a Oakland school play in 1941.
After serving in the Marine Corps during World War II, he was given
a screen test by Universal, but a studio executive advised him to
continue his theater work.
   Following 2{ years in summer stock, Webber made his debut on
Broadway with a nine-line part in ``Two Blind Mice'' in 1948. He
subsequently replaced Richard Basehart in ``Goodbye My Fancy,''
opposite Madeline Carroll.
   His first film appearance came in 1951 as a gangster in
``Highway 301.'' Later that decade, Webber was seen in ``The Philco
Playhouse,'' ``The Hallmark Hall of Fame'' and ``Robert Montgomery
Presents'' and the plays ``No Time for Sergeants,'' ``Orpheus
Descending,'' ``Wonderful Town'' an ``A Loss of Roses.''
   He co-starred as the glib Juror No. 12 with Henry Fonda, Lee J.
Cobb and Jack Klugman in 1957's ``Twelve Angry Men,'' and then
appeared in the television shows ``The Rifleman,'' ``Maverick,''
``The Dick Powell Show,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ``Route
66,'' ``The Defenders,'' ``Naked City,'' ``Ben Casey,'' ``The
Fugitive'' and ``The Outer Limits.''
   In the 1960s, he starred in the movies ``The Stripper,'' ``The
Sandpiper,'' ``Harper'' and ``The Dirty Dozen.''
   His film roles also included ``The Great White Hope,'' ``Casey's
Shadow,'' ``Dollars,'' ``Midway,'' ``The Choirboys,'' ``Sunday
Lovers,'' ``Wrong is Right'' and ``Wild Geese II.''
   Webber is survived by his wife, Del, and father, Robert. Funeral
arrangements were private.

<LEADPARA>  After seven years of searching, a multinational team of researchers has found
the approximate location of the gene that causes one form of the devastating
paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's
disease. The step represents the first major advance in determining the cause
of the disease in the 122 years since it was first identified, according to
neurologist and team leader Teepu Siddique of Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill.;    Also, a Philadelphia biologist has reported the discovery
of a gene that may be a key to lung cancer, the leading cancer killer. If the
discovery is borne out by further studies, it could lead to treatments and
diagnostic tests for a disease expected to kill 143,000 Americans this year,
said Carlo Croce, a molecular geneticist at Temple University and a member of
the team that made the discovery.  </LEADPARA>

MORNING BRIEFING: EX-49ER COACH WALSH THROWS MEDIA FOR LOSS IN NBC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a seminar called by NBC to introduce its new announcers for the pro football 
season, the introduction of Bill Walsh was saved for last. 
</P>
<P>
According to Glenn Sheeley of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Walsh 
calmly walked up to address the group. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, Walsh said, "G-g-g-good m-m-m-morning, it's g-g-good to s-s-see 
y-y-you." 
</P>
<P>
Sheeley: "When NBC-TV executive producer Terry O'Neil's heart started again, he 
couldn't stop laughing." 
</P>
<P>
The holdup: Mike Schad, the big tackle from Canada who was a bust with the Rams 
after they made him their No. 1 pick in 1986, is a potential starter this 
season with Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Schad was endorsed by former lineman Doug Bartlett. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett: "There's nothing wrong with his toughness. The only thing wrong that 
I can see is that he doesn't know how to hold yet." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who is the only player to win stolen base titles in both the 
American League and National League? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Chasing the Horse: Cal Ripken's move into third place last week in consecutive 
games played has, naturally, raised the question of his possibly catching Lou 
Gehrig, whose record of 2,130 straight games has long been looked upon as 
unassailable. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows, of course, whether the Baltimore Oriole shortstop can catch the 
Iron Horse, but if he does, he will be younger than Gehrig was when Gehrig's 
remarkable streak ended. Gehrig was 35 when he stepped out of the Yankee 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken will turn 29 Thursday and, if he keeps his streak alive, will be 34, 
about two months shy of 35, when he matches Gehrig's record in the 70th game of 
the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
Help Wanted: Mike Tyson not only is running out of opponents, he is running low 
on sparring partners. He went through 10 before the Carl (The Truth) Williams 
fight. Either they were getting busted up or were sent home because they did 
little else but run in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Page, one of the few who lasted, told the Philadelphia Inquirer: "You 
should have seen Melvin Epps. Carl Lewis has nothing on him." 
</P>
<P>
Page, a former champion, said: "Most people are afraid of Mike Tyson. I think 
I'm just crazy enough to have no fear of him. The only person I fear is God . . 
. and my wife." 
</P>
<P>
Cerebral Cowboy: Dallas Cowboy Owner Jerry Jones, who played football with 
Jimmy Johnson at Arkansas, told the Houston Chronicle: "Jimmy is not head coach 
of the Cowboys because he is my friend. Our friendship merely made me aware of 
his tremendous intellect and coaching skill. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy was one of those students who could look at a book for 20 minutes and go 
to class and take a test, while everybody else had to work hours and days and 
days to get ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
53 years ago today: On Aug. 23, 1936, 17-year-old Bob Feller, in his first 
major league start, recorded 15 strikeouts as the Cleveland Indians beat the 
St. Louis Browns, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ron LeFlore. He stole 68 bases for Detroit in 1978 and 97 bases 
for Montreal in 1980. 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: HE'S NOT OUT TO BE FRONT AND CENTER

<P>
I would not want to be Mychal Thompson. Just as I would not want to have been 
George Selkirk, Hunk Anderson, Babe Dahlgren, Gene Bartow or even Gene Tunney. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson probably doesn't know who most of these guys are -- but he 
will. 
</P>
<P>
They are sports figures I think of as guys who weren't. As in, the guy who 
wasn't Babe Ruth, the guy who wasn't Jack Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
George Selkirk is the guy who wasn't Babe Ruth. Hunk Anderson is the guy who 
wasn't Knute Rockne. Babe Dahlgren is the guy who wasn't Lou Gehrig. Gene 
Bartow is the guy who wasn't John Wooden. I think you know who Tunney wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson is going to join this ghostly company next year. He's about to 
become the guy who wasn't Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be like following George M. Cohan on a vaudeville bill, taking 
over Patton's army or being the guest host on Johnny Carson's show. 
</P>
<P>
He gets the spot on the bill of the guy who came to foreclose the mortgage. 
Count Dracula would be a sentimental favorite by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing a legend is the quickest and surest way to unpopularity, if not 
obscurity. Selkirk, it so happens, was a pretty good ballplayer. He hit .312 
the year he replaced Babe Ruth. But he was no Bambino. He hit only 11 home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
His nickname was Twinkletoes. What kind of name is that for the substitute for 
the Sultan of Swat? Selkirk couldn't win. If he had hit 61 home runs, they 
would have hated him for that. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Dahlgren was a pretty good ballplayer, too. But he was no Lou Gehrig. He 
drove in 89 runs the year he took over for Lou. Not bad -- but Gehrig had 
driven in 184 one year. 
</P>
<P>
Heartley (Hunk) Anderson never got a chance to show whether he was a good coach 
or not. When he replaced Rockne, the Rock's teams had just gone two seasons 
undefeated. Anderson went 6-2-1 and 7-2 but got the gate the next year. 
</P>
<P>
All Gene Bartow ever heard when he was coach at UCLA was how Wooden would have 
done it. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson knows what he's in for. And he doesn't care for the sensation. 
First of all, he's being asked to replace a guy who is the leading scorer in 
basketball history with 38,387 regular-season points. That's 26,571 more than 
Mychal Thompson has scored. He's going in for a guy who has 18,440 rebounds. 
That's not the most in history, but it's 12,174 more than Mychal has. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem also has a half a foot in height and a 35-pound pull in the weight. 
Replacing him might be easier than playing him. 
</P>
<P>
But Mychal doesn't see why he has to do either. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they get someone," he said candidly the other day. 
</P>
<P>
In other forms of show business, understudies are players who secretly can't 
wait for the star to fall down stairs or get hit by a truck so that they can go 
out there and show the public how much better they are. 
</P>
<P>
It's Mychal Thompson's worst nightmare. Thompson is quite content with his 
off-the-bench role, with his role calling for him to jump in the game and give 
the regular center (or forward) a "blow" (respite from the action), drop in his 
9.2 points, suck up a few fouls, not win the game, but keep the team from 
losing it. 
</P>
<P>
He does this as well as or better than almost anyone else in the league. He 
played in 80 of the Lakers' 82 games this season, although he started in only 
eight of them and none last season. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal is not exactly in the famous "Bench me or trade me" frame of mind 
popularized by the late Chico Ruiz, but he would like it if the Lakers would go 
out and get somebody else to be Kareem Jabbar -- or rather not to be Kareem 
Jabbar. Mychal likes being the butler. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope they'd take that million and a half and get someone," he admits 
frankly. 
</P>
<P>
Pro basketball is the only major sport that has a salary cap for its employees. 
The union traded this off in return for getting 55% of the revenues. Its aim 
generally is not so much to save money as to equalize the competition, prevent 
some reckless billionaire from buying up all the available talent. 
</P>
<P>
Under its complicated formula, the departure of Kareem will leave the club with 
$1.5 million to get a pivot man. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson might be distressed to know that his coach wishes that the 
club, instead, would distribute some of that money to Thompson and stay out of 
the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to get for that money?" Pat Riley demands. "You're not 
going to get Patrick Ewing or Akeem Olajuwon or Robert Parish or Mark Eaton. 
For just an established center, they're going to begin the general negotiations 
by asking for a James Worthy or Byron Scott. We're not going to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to tell management what to do, but I'd like to see them spread 
that money to Mychal and let's post him up. Mychal's 33 but he's a young 33." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect does not noticeably thrill Thompson. His attitude rather reminds 
you of the character in Lincoln's life who was tarred and feathered and ridden 
out of town on a rail and, asked how he felt about it, replied: "If it weren't 
for the honor of the thing, I'd rather walk." 
</P>
<P>
Mychal would rather sit. A cheerful fellow who never played basketball till he 
was 17 years old, Mychal's ambition is not to be the next Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
it's to be the next prime minister of the Bahamas, where he was brought up. 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson has had some hard-to-figure career turns before -- picking 
Minnesota as his college, for example. Mychal was bucking a huge trend going 
from the sapphire seas of the Grand Bahamas to the ice fishing holes of the 
Minnetonka. 
</P>
<P>
He'll get to be a trivia answer someday. But those ghostly images in the 
background shaking their heads and saying, "Don't do it, Mike" are guys named 
Selkirk, Anderson, Dahlgren, and maybe even the guy who shot Jesse James. 
</P>
<P>
They don't have to tell Mychal Thompson. He doesn't want to fill anybody else's 
shoes. Least of all, theirs.

<LEADPARA>  PERHAPS because of baseball's longevity, or maybe because of its association
with childhood summers, the sport thrives on nostalgia. It's a game many of us
can regard with soul-warming affection, even if we didn't play it well. By
definition, then, a videocassette called "Baseball's Greatest Moments" (60
minutes, $19.95) is destined to find a receptive audience.;    The tape also
happens to be a production of Major League Baseball Home Video, giving it that
"official" cachet. The viewer can rest assured the best available game footage
was used.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THE BOYS OF SUMMER AND THEIR GREATEST HITS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  VIDEO  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     New York focus;    The tape limits itself to 20 "greatest moments," which
fill an hour nicely but also will spark disappointment among partisans who
have their own ideas of greatness. The relative merits of specific plays can
be argued endlessly by fans (and in fact they are, to the game's enrichment),
so your own favorite may have to wait for an enlightened sequel.;    For the
time being, however, it's fair to say that fans of the Yankees, Dodgers and
Giants will find themselves particularly well-served. Among the players
extolled here are Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Willie
Mays, Bobby Thomson, Don Larsen, Roger Maris and Reggie Jackson. The rest of
the country may wonder why MLB Home Video didn't call the tape "New York
Baseball's Greatest Moments.";    Starting with Babe Ruth's "called shot"
homer in 1932 and ending with Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter just last year,
each historic moment is preceded by a title screen describing the event and
date. The titles are set inside of picture frames, and signature scenes from
each event are glorified with special video treatment that renders
painting-like images.;    The narration supplies the context leading up to the
crucial action -- Mays' over-the-shoulder catch in 1954, Larsen's perfect game
in the 1956 World Series, Maris' 61st home run, Pete Rose's 4,192th career hit
and so on.;    Looking back;    Where possible, each is followed by the
comments of players or managers as they are today, looking back at the moment.
These scenes can be powerfully moving, such as Maris' recollection of feeling
embarrassed about stepping out of the dugout to take a bow after he broke
Ruth's home-run record, or Harvey Haddix still smiling at the fates who took a
game away from him even after he had pitched 12 perfect innings.;    "Greatest
Moments" is not limited to actual hits, runs and errors. Also shown are
Gehrig's farewell speech in 1939 (coupled with DiMaggio's reflection on that
day) as well as the arrival of Robinson in the major leagues. Leo Durocher
recalls the very unwelcoming attitude of his Dodgers and his own words of
advice: "You'd better get used to it, boys."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Irish Eyes Are Cryin' For Tenor Dennis Day, Who Died at Age 71</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis Day, a golden-voiced Irish balladeer
whose career as a foil for comedian Jack Benny spanned decades of
radio, television and film, has died after a long battle with Lou
Gehrig's disease. He was 71.
   Day died at his Bel Air home late Wednesday, surrounded by his
10 children and 13 grandchildren, said his publicist, Kitty Davis.
   ``Everyone is taking it very hard,'' she said.
   His wife, Peggy Margaret McNulty was admitted to St. John's
Hospital and Health Center earlier in the day for cardiac tests and
was in stable condition, said nursing supervisor Nancy Gauthier.
Doctors have not confirmed whether she suffered a heart attack, Ms.
Gauthier said.
   The cause of death was not determined, but Day was diagnosed
last year as suffering from amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a
progressive muscular ailment that killed Lou Gehrig.
   He had undergone brain surgery in March after suffering a fall,
and was readmitted to St. John's on June 5, the hospital said. He
was released from the hospital Monday.
   ``I'm very, very saddened by Dennis' death,'' said comedian
Jerry Lewis, national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association, which Day supported.
   ``Dennis Day was a brave, kind, talented man who showed his love
by giving. All you had to do was ask.''
   Day's career spanned decades in radio, television and movies,
and he was rated as one of the shrewdest talents in the business.
   Born Eugene Denis McNulty to Irish parents in New York City on
May 21, 1917, he was graduated from St. Patrick's Cathedral High
School and attended Manhattan College with plans to enter Fordham's
law school.
   His plans changed when Jack Benny was hunting for a singer to
replace Kenny Baker. A recording Day had made earned him an
audition, and an off-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job,
according to a studio biography.
   With all the applicants gathered in an audition room, Benny
called out, ``Oh Dennis!'' Young McNulty replied, ``Yes, please.''
   ``That's it!'' Benny whooped.
   He assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny's radio show
as a singer in 1939, and quickly matured into a comic target for
the host. One of Day's trademark lines was a sprightly, ``Gee, Mr.
Benny!''
   With a nationwide audience on radio, Day gained popularity with
his renditions of ``Danny Boy,'' ``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and
other ballads. Another Day favorite, ``Peg of my Heart'' was a
ballad he sang for his wife, said Ms. Davis.
   In 1952, Day disclosed that Irish authorities had banned his RCA
recording of ``The St. Patrick's Day Parade.''
   ``The Irish didn't object to the song or to my singing,'' Day
said, but to shouted exlamations such as ``How are ye, Paddy, me
boy!'' as if he were marching in a parade.
   ``They said (it) sounded like stage Irish,'' Day said at the
time, with some bemusement.
   Day moved to television with Benny's show in 1950, making
irregular appearances.
   In 1951, Day demonstrated his business acumen by landing a movie
contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he was the only Fox
contract player with television rights. He also signed a contract
with NBC, after allowing weeks of bidding between the network and
competitor CBS.
   Day became a regular on such TV variety shows as ``All Star
Revue,'' ``Hour Glass,'' ``The RCA Victor Show,'' ``Max Liebman
Presents'' and his own ``Dennis Day Show.''
   He also appeared in several films, including ``Buck Benny Rides
Again,'' ``Music in Manhattan,'' ``One Sunday Afternoon'' and ``The
Girl Next Door.''
   In their later years, the Days divided their time between their
Bel Air home and a second home in Hawaii. He enjoyed horseback
riding and sailing.
   During a vacation in Hawaii last year, Day became aware of a
muscle-control problem and returned to the Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla, where doctors diagnosed ALS.
   Day's publicist said that though he was confined to a
wheelchair, he continued to make appearances at Irish fairs and
medical benefits.
   ``Up to the end there, he was still doing benefits. After he
found out that he had ALS he said that he wanted to do as much for
this research group as possible,'' Ms. Davis said.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

JIM MURRAY: MARK HIS WORDS, 60 HOME RUNS STILL POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long history of major league baseball, only 10 men have hit 50 or more 
homers in a season. Only two have hit 60 or more. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 28 years since anyone hit 50 in the American League. That would be 
Roger Maris, who hit 61 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
When he did that, the then-commissioner of baseball, quaking in his concern for 
the memory of Babe Ruth, put an asterisk next to the achievement in the record 
book, noting that it was done in a season eight games longer than the ones Ruth 
played in. The commissioner was afraid, apparently, that the 60-homer season 
would become commonplace with expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Frick needn't have worried. Not only has no one hit 60 in that league 
since, no one has even hit 50. 
</P>
<P>
Will anyone ever hit 60 again? Will anyone even hit 50? 
</P>
<P>
I took the problem to one of the young men I consider to be a prime threat to, 
one day, get an asterisk after his name -- Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire is a hitter for the Oakland Athletics, who looks as if he had just 
walked off a Saturday Evening Post cover -- sandy hair, blue eyes, just a hint 
of freckles. He's as strong as truck-stop coffee and as uncomplicated as a 
summer day, the All-American type who seemingly can deal with the everyday 
pressures of big league baseball as nonchalantly as the Babe himself. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire hit more home runs, 49, in his first year than any other rookie who 
ever played and might have hit 50 if he hadn't shortened the season to go home 
for the birth of his first child. 
</P>
<P>
Very few people have hit 100 home runs as quickly in their big league careers 
as McGwire. His teammate, Jose Canseco, is one. Tony Conigliaro of the Boston 
Red Sox was another. 
</P>
<P>
So I thought Mark might be a good man to ask what it might take to hit 60 home 
runs now. Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco Giants is 18 homers ahead of him 
this year -- but Mark is 14 ahead of Mitchell lifetime. And four years younger. 
</P>
<P>
Are 60 homers in a season even possible? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"I know guys who can do it," he said. "Freddy McGriff of Toronto, Jose 
(Canseco), Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
What about Mark McGwire? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire sighed. "Well, it would depend on a number of factors." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's see. It'd go about like this: 
</P>
<P>
"1. The media. You have to take into account what the media would do today as 
you got closer. I don't think those old-time ballplayers like Ruth and Maris 
had that to contend with. (Oh, yes, Maris did!) 
</P>
<P>
"Today, you would have Channels 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and '60 Minutes' and every 
magazine and newspaper in the country on your doorstep, in your locker, in the 
shower. To hit 60 home runs, you'd need to concentrate solely on your game and 
these distractions wouldn't help. 
</P>
<P>
"2. Jose Canseco. You need the other dangerous hitter in the lineup behind you 
or ahead of you. Ruth had (Lou) Gehrig. Henry Aaron had Eddie Mathews. Maris 
had Mickey Mantle. (Willie) Mays had (Willie) McCovey. Frank Robinson had 
Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I would need Jose Canseco. Or vice versa. You need that other hitter so the 
pitchers can't pitch around you, so that you get pitches to hit. You can't get 
60 home runs swinging at ball four all season." 
</P>
<P>
"3. Adjustment. You're not going to get the same pitches all year long. What 
you hit home runs off the first half of the season, you're not going to get the 
last half. Pitchers will make you hit something else. They're not going to 
throw you what you've shown you can hit. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to adjust to a new location or a new speed. That's why a lot of guys 
have a flock of home runs by the All-Star break but tail off after that. You 
don't get 60 homers in a half a season." 
</P>
<P>
"4. Health. You have to stay healthy and injury-free. You have to be able to 
fight off fatigue. September might be the most important month. (Ruth hit 17 
home runs in September of the season he hit 60.) And if you're mentally 
fatigued, your timing is all off. 
</P>
<P>
"5. Pull. I don't mean influence, I mean pulling the ball. I get most of my 
home runs to left-center or center. To hit 60, you have to pull the ball a lot, 
get your share of foul-line home runs. I don't think it's possible to hit 60 
420-foot home runs. Too many things have to go just right. 
</P>
<P>
"6. Patience. I never, or almost never, hit a home run while I'm trying to. I 
didn't even know I was a home run hitter when I was coming up. I just tried to 
hit the ball fair some place. That's when you get home runs. I led the nation 
(with 32 home runs) when I was in college (at USC). Then I hit 24 home runs at 
Modesto. But a home run happens. You don't forceit." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a generation now since anyone even hit 50 in the American League. Lou 
Gehrig never hit 50. Neither did the all-time homer champion, Henry Aaron. 
Neither did Roger Maris, except for his record year. 
</P>
<P>
The only batters who hit 60 were left-handed, but all but three of the nine who 
hit 50 were strictly right-handed -- Ralph Kiner, Mays, Hack Wilson, Hank 
Greenberg, Jimmie Foxx, George Foster. Mantle was a switch-hitter, Johnny Mize 
and Ruth were lefties. 
</P>
<P>
Are even 50 possible? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire laughed. "Well, I would need some great September!" He has 21 to date. 
</P>
<P>
Does he aim for 600 lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire shook his head. "What my goal is has nothing to do with that. I want to 
win a WorldSeries." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's one way to look at that: Every guy who has ever hit 60 home runs 
has led his team to a World Series victory. Look it up.

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert R. Hurwitz, who co-founded a Newport Beach law firm four decades ago and 
served as an officer of the National Council of Christians and Jews, died 
Tuesday after a long struggle against Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz was diagnosed with the degenerative nerve disorder, also known as 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a year ago, but he continued to practice law 
until last May, when he lost his ability to speak and was forced to retire, 
said his wife, Shirley Mae. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz was born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1921, and served as an Army officer in 
Europe during World War II. He took an interest in the law after the war when 
he served as a military governor in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Graduating second in his law school class at UC Berkeley in 1950, Hurwitz and 
his brother, Max Hurwitz, opened the first law firm in Newport Beach the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, originally known as Hurwitz &amp; Hurwitz, is now called Hurwitz, 
Remer, Divincenzo &amp; Griffith and represents Orange County clients such as 
the Costa Mesa-based Daily Pilot newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to working as an attorney, Hurwitz served from 1964 to 1975 as a 
California inheritance tax referee. He eventually made that his field of 
expertise, serving as president of the Inheritance Tax Appraisers Assn., and 
vice chairman of a State Bar tax committee. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz taught inheritance law at the Pepperdine School of Law in the late 
1970s and was a member of several bar associations and other legal 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz served on the national board of the Council of Christians and Jews and 
was the founder and longtime chairman of the Orange County branch of the NCCJ. 
He said in a magazine interview last year that he got involved with the NCCJ to 
do what he could to reduce racial tensions in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz was also a member of California Community Foundation, Orange County 
World Affairs Council, Town Hall of California and Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
After a foot operation in 1988, Hurwitz lost his ability to walk -- a condition 
doctors later attributed to ALS. He continued to work, however, until the 
disease robbed him of his ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"With Lou Gehrig's disease, you never lose your mind. He lost his ability to 
communicate," said Hurwitz's son, Mark Hughes. "That was difficult for him." 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz is also survived by a daughter Kim Davidge, a sister, Sophie Gendel, 
and a grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be private. Family members request that memorial 
donations be made to the ALS Foundation or to the NCCJ.

   Beyond human growth hormone, with its promise for help in
retarding the aging process, the horizon holds an array of
other trophic, or growth, factors with great medical
potential. Each factor has a different target cell in the
body, and each has a possible role in protecting the body's
nerve cells against damage from the likes of Alzheimer's
disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.
   An explosion of discovery in recent years has yielded
insights into a "superfamily" of proteins called
neurotrophic, or nerve growth, factors. Human clinical trials
using such factors may begin as early as this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Alzheimer's disease, causing dementia and death, afflicts
an estimated 3.5 million Americans. Hopes for treatment were
buoyed in the late 1980s by Fred M. Gage, a neuroscientist at
the University of California at San Diego. Dr. Gage taught a
group of senile rats to swim through a water maze. He then
treated half the rats with nerve-growth factor and the rest
with a placebo. After a 10-day rest period, the rats were put
through their aquatic paces again. Only the rats treated with
nerve-growth factor found their way through the maze.
   "In a variety of learning and memory tests, it was shown
infusions of nerve-growth factor into the brain could improve
learning capacity and increased the size of neurons that had
shrunken," says Dr. Gage. His findings galvanized
biotechnology companies.
   "The real excitement of those experiments is that they're
in a natural animal system caused by aging," says Frank
Collins, vice president of neuroscience at Synergen Inc., a
Boulder, Colo., company developing nerve-growth factor with
Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif. The Synergen-Syntex team
could begin human clinical testing in late 1993. Genentech
Inc. is also working on the factor.
   In Parkinson's disease, the brain cells controlling
movement tend to degenerate, causing tremors and weakness.
Now there is an animal model suggesting one new factor might
work to restore damaged cells. The observation grew from a
chemical mishap among drug addicts who used a "designer" drug
mimicking heroin. That drug was contaminated with a
neurotoxin, MPTP, that provoked quaking, jerky motions much
like those of Parkinson's. However, in monkey tests, nerve
cells were protected from MPTP by a protein called basic
fibroblast growth factor.
   Basic fibroblast growth factor is being pursued by Scios
Inc. (formerly California Biotechnology Inc.) of Mountain
View, Calif., and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., in
collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Synergen and Syntex are
investigating the protein for stroke patients and have
discovered another new protein for Parkinson's disease.
   Yet another new biotechnology product -- brain-derived
neurotrophic factor -- is aimed at salvaging the shattered
neurons of Parkinson's patients. This product is made by
Genentech and a collaboration of Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks,
Calif., and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, N.Y.
Those same companies are competing to develop still another
related protein called neurotrophin-3 as a possible candidate
to treat Alzheimer's and various kinds of nerve damage.
   The disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which ended the
baseball career of the legendary Lou Gehrig, will soon be
targeted by another new growth factor. In the disease's final
stages, patients are hooked to a respirator, able to move
only their eyes. "The husband of one patient told me he's
kept her alive so she can receive this protein," says
Synergen's Dr. Collins. Tests of the substance -- called
ciliary neurotrophic factor -- are planned by Regeneron and
the Syntex/Synergen team. "We expect to be in the clinic by
mid-1992," a Synergen spokeswoman says.
   The difficulty with nerve-growth factor and its chemical
kin is that most of the molecules are large and unwieldy.
Unable to reach their target cells via tablets or normal
injections, they must so far be pumped directly into the
brain.
   "Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease are
devastating, so it becomes contemplatable to plant a pump" in
the brain, says Dr. Collins. "If you simply forget the car
keys, it's debatable whether you want to do that."
   Eventually, new drug-delivery technologies like nasal
sprays may simplify treatment and enable doctors to dream of
early treatment or even prevention.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
RIPKEN IS SECOND ON CONSECUTIVE-GAME LIST; ORIOLES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Ripken Jr. has the second-longest playing streak in major league baseball, 
yet the Baltimore Orioles' shortstop has received as much criticism as acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken played in his 1,308th consecutive game Tuesday night at Baltimore in a 
game in which Randy Milligan hit his 10th home run leading off the 10th inning 
to give the Orioles a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who trailed most of the game, tied it, 3-3, on Mickey Tettleton's 
home run with two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken passed Everett Scott for the No. 2 spot in longevity behind Lou Gehrig. 
Ripken is 822 games -- or more than five seasons -- way from Gehrig's record of 
2,130. 
</P>
<P>
But many believe Ripken should not even try to break the record. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore fans claim Ripken has looked lethargic and even weary lately. He was 
0 for 4 against the Brewers and is batting only .163 since May 18 (14 for 86). 
</P>
<P>
When asked about it, Ripken said, "The only thing I'm tired about is hearing so 
many people asking me if I'm tired. I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, who went into a slump late last season, is batting only .213 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what I've done," Ripken said, "but there isn't any big special 
feeling. I don't mean to downplay it, but it really is just another game. 
Maybe, if by some stroke of luck I catch Gehrig, then that will really be 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, who will be 30 in August, would be 35 if he plays every game until he 
reaches Gehrig's record. 
</P>
<P>
His streak began after a day off following sitting out the second game of a 
doubleheader on May 29, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any idea this would happen," he said. "It wasn't something I set 
out to do. It's something I never consciously said I was going to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief, in a way. But I never did understand the meaning of the streak 
and all the attention that has been poured into it." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken may not be impressed, but his peers certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," the Brewers' Paul Molitor said. "He can take a foul ball off 
the foot or get hit by a pitch, but he's still climbing Mt. Everest. He's 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Oakland 5 -- Dennis Eckersley failed in relief for the first time in 
21 tries. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley, who has 20 saves, was brought in with the Athletics leading, 5-2, in 
the ninth inning at Oakland. An error by shortstop Walter Weiss started the 
Rangers' rally, and Eckersley, who issued his first two walks of the season, 
gave up three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Of little solace was Rickey Henderson becoming only the second player to reach 
900 steals. Henderson stole second and third bases in the first inning to reach 
the goal. Jose Canseco was released from the hospital, where he has been 
treated for back problems, but he will not accompany the team to Chicago after 
today's game. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Minnesota 4 -- A three-base error by Twin second baseman Fred 
Manrique allowed Toronto to score two unearned runs in the seventh inning at 
Minneapolis and put the Blue Jays into first place in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth loss in a row for the Twins after their 21-7 record was the 
best May in their history. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins led, 4-3, when Mookie Wilson singled with one out in the seventh 
inning. John Candelaria relieved Kevin Tapani and got Junior Felix to hit a 
potential double play ball, but the ball rolled through Manrique and gave 
Toronto its winning runs. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Boston 4 -- Steve Balboni's run scoring, pinch-hit pinch-hit single 
snapped an eighth inning tie at New York and the Yankees knocked the Red Sox 
out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti got the last three outs for his 12th save this season and the 
200th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game the Yankees learned that pitcher Pascual Perez, who has made 
only three starts since signing a three-year $5.7 million contract, may require 
shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 7, Detroit 3 -- Chris James hit a three-run home run and Sandy Alomar 
had three hits at Detroit to lead the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Black (5-3) gave up seven hits and walked three, but pitched his second 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
James capped a four-run third inning with his fourth home run of the season and 
the Indians were never headed. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lindeman, making his first start for the Tigers, homered and drove in all 
three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Johnson helped spoil the White Sox hopes of 
moving to within a game of Oakland in this game at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson (6-3) won his third in a row, giving up three hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
Buhner hit his fifth home run this month. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, who had won four in a row, are two games behind Oakland in the 
West.

   The story of a football coach stricken in the
prime of life by Lou Gehrig's disease isn't exactly light-hearted
viewing, but Pam Dawber, who plays the coach's wife, found the movie
``happy.''
   ``It's really about the human spirit at its very best,'' she
said. ``I think he inspires so many people by overcoming his own
incredible trauma. It's a hopeful, happy movie.''
   It was soon after Dawber's CBS sitcom ``My Sister Sam'' was
finally dropped for good after bouncing around the schedule for two
seasons that she was offered the role as Lucy Wedemeyer in the
real-life movie ``Quiet Victory,'' which CBS will air Monday, the
day after Christmas.
   Mrs. Wedemeyer helps her husband, Charlie Wedemeyer (Michael
Nouri), continue his coaching career despite the disease that leaves
him unable to speak or move.
   Dawber had held off new projects until she got final word on ``My
Sister Sam,'' so the movie offer came as she was ready for something
new. The series was on-again, off-again on CBS until April.
   ``We all thought we were going back to work on the USA Network,''
she said. ``Tribune Entertainment was nearly ready to make 44 new
shows. Then it fell through. Too bad. It was a good show. But it was
the victim of network politics.
   ``They wanted our Monday night time slot for a new show, `Frank's
Place.' So they ended up killing two shows. `Frank's Place' never
should have been on at 8 o'clock. It was a more sophisticated show.''
   ``My Sister Sam'' was moved to Saturday night its second year,
but was soon taken off the air. It returned briefly in April as part
of CBS' ill-fated attempt to program sitcoms on Tuesday.
   April wasn't all bad for Dawber. She and husband Mark Harmon had
their son, Sean.
   For ``Quiet Victory,'' she packed up her new baby and spent
several weeks filming on Folly Beach, on one of the sea islands off
South Carolina. The Wedemeyers live in Los Gatos, which is south of
San Francisco, but it was too expensive to film there.
   ``So, we went to South Carolina, which has palm trees, old houses
and beaches,'' she said.
   Wedemeyer was 30 when he learned he had amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, called Lou Gehrig's disease after the famous New York
Yankee first baseman who was also stricken. A former star
quarterback at Michigan State, Wedemeyer was coaching the Los Gatos
Wildcats and teaching mathematics. He was married to his high school
sweetheart, Lucy, a former cheerleader.
   He's a native of Hawaii, where he was known as ``Kalekauwila,''
God of Lightning. His brother is Herman Wedemeyer, another football
star, who played Detective Duke Lukela for eight years on ``Hawaii
Five-0.''
   ``Charlie is completely immobile,'' said Dawber. ``He can move
his lips. He has a portable breathing apparatus and a feeding tube
and sometimes gets around in a golf cart. Lucy reads his lips and
relays his coaching commands to the team. ...
   ``He's a regal, charismatic man. Lucy's kept him alive through
her attitude. They both have a wonderful sense of humor. She's a
terribly selfless woman. Lucy in a way is the cheerleader for Los
Gatos. The community has done so much for them and with them.''
   The movie was directed by Roy Campanella II, whose father played
for the Brooklyn Dodgers until an automobile accident left him an
invalid.
   Now that the movie is completed, Dawber, who gained fame as Robin
Williams' foil on ``Mork and Mindy,'' is ``shopping around'' for a
new comedy series.
   A sitcom offers ``the most reasonble schedule,'' she said. ``I
don't want my son dragged around while I do more movies. I want the
industry to know that I'm available.''
   Dawber, who has sung in many musicals, including ``Pirates of
Penzance'' on Broadway, planned to audition for the role of
Christine in the Los Angeles production of ``Phantom of the Opera.''
She said she would have to audition without benefit of having seen
the play, since she was unable to get tickets to the show in New
York.

   Gene-hunting scientists said they have narrowed down the
location of a defective gene that causes an inherited form of
the disease that killed Yankee baseball star Lou Gehrig.
   A large, international research team reported that it had
studied the genes of members of 23 families that were haunted
by an inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS.
The disease is a progressive paralysis in which the nerves
that control the muscles are destroyed. It is a fatal
disorder with no effective treatment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The researchers, led by neurologist Teepu Siddique of
Northwestern University, reported that four genetic probes
that distinguished ALS-affected members from healthy
relatives all homed in on a section of chromosome number 21,
indicating strongly that the ALS gene lay nearby. There are
23 human chromosomes, tiny rod-like structures in cells that
contain all the genes. The exact location of the ALS gene,
however, isn't yet known.
   The large majority of ALS cases aren't inherited but occur
spontaneously. The researchers, however, suggested that
finding the gene for the inherited form of the disease could
disclose the cause of the spontaneous form.

<LEADPARA>  Item: Jose Canseco, after a 1990 game in which he hit a ball that had the
audacity not to reach the Oakland Coliseum's left-field bleachers, imparted
this wisdom to sportswriters: "Baseball's entertainment, and the fans like to
see home runs. They should move the fences in.";    Item: Mickey Mantle, in a
national radio interview this season, talked of his rookie year -- Joe
DiMaggio's last -- with the New York Yankees, 1951. "He was supposed to be
sort of washed up, I guess. . . . It just makes me wonder how good he must
have been before." Mantle, an expert witness and, like Canseco, one of the
most powerful hitters ever, discussed the plight of a right-handed hitter such
as DiMaggio playing half his games each season in cavernous Yankee Stadium,
before it was rebuilt and the dimensions were reduced in 1976. "I remember a
Sunday when he hit four balls at least 420 feet. They all got caught. He
probably has four home runs if he's playing somewhere else. Instead he goes 0
for 4."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Commentary
Chart attached to the end of this article
Frank Cracolice, currently a Features department copy editor, is a former
Mercury News sportswriter who counted baseball assignments among his duties.
He also is a lifelong DiMaggio fan.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Mantle is quoted to inform any player who thinks he has it so bad --
Canseco, for example -- that among all the great hitters, no one had a more
unfavorable home park than DiMaggio.;    And make no mistake: DiMaggio was a
great hitter, and not just because of that 56-game hitting streak that has
been celebrated since he strung it together in 1941. Consider that while
hitting 361 home runs in his 13 seasons, DiMaggio struck out only 368 times.
Those numbers separate him from all other hitters -- confirming his ability to
make contact as so-called "singles hitters" do while powering the ball as only
sluggers do. The strikeout, a power hitter's prerogative, was almost
transcended by DiMaggio.;    Consider also: DiMaggio, who along with Ted
Williams will be an honorary American League co-captain at Tuesday's All-Star
Game, hit 30 or more home runs and struck out less than his home run totals in
seven separate seasons -- an unheard of pairing of precision and power. It is
considered excellent contact for a home run hitter if he can hold his
strikeouts to 2 1/2 times his home runs in a season. (Hank Aaron struck out
almost twice for each homer he hit, exceptional; Willie Mays struck out nearly
2 1/2 times per home run; and Mantle more than three times for each homer.);  
 A rare parlay;  Tommy Henrich, DiMaggio teammate and admirer, told author
David Halberstam in the latter's fine book, "Summer of '49," that the two
numbers, 361 and 368, still made him incredulous, all these years later.;   
Such a combination of contact and crunch is a rare parlay indeed. It's Ray
Robinson, choosing to box or slug as he saw fit; Jim Brown, running over or
around a defender; Sandy Koufax, striking out batters without having to pay
his way with walks. Choices of skills that only the greats possess.;    What
makes DiMaggio's power numbers so impressive is that he played at Yankee
Stadium with its dreaded left-center field, Death Valley. Only right down the
line could DiMaggio get away with the kind of home run that today elicits
high-fives and arm-bashes from teammates. From straightaway left to
right-center, DiMaggio's power zone, Yankee Stadium's fences were more than
400 feet away at most angles, with awesome distances of 457 and 461 feet to
left-center and dead (indeed) center field.;    So I get impatient with a
Canseco politicking for an easier home target in Oakland. Making Canseco's
pleas even harder to swallow is his penchant for striking out, in which case
it doesn't matter where the fences are.;    The game has changed;  There has
been much talk about whether today's stars could have played back when, but to
turn the proposition around, wouldn't DiMaggio and Williams like their chances
in today's game?;    Wouldn't they thrive on the various artificial-turf
fields? And forget that argument on behalf of today's pitching staffs as being
deeper and more talented. The only place they go deeper is in the count.
Today's batters are competing against pitchers throwing off 10-inch mounds at
strike zones that give batters the best of it. DiMaggio and Williams swung
against pitchers delivering from 16-inch mounds toward a bigger and more
consistently determined strike zone.;    DiMaggio, whose all-around ability
has served to somewhat obscure his batting skills, accepted as a challenge his
disadvantage at playing in the House That Ruth Built. Had DiMaggio's career --
from 1936-51 -- not been interrupted by three years' Army service, we can
assume fairly that he could have had about 460 lifetime homers, based on his
average of 33 per season in his first five years, giving him 99 or so more.;  
 In his second season, 1937, DiMaggio hit a career-high 46 home runs. Not
surprisingly, 27 came on the road. The trend was set. In 1950, DiMaggio hit 32
home runs, only nine of them at Yankee Stadium; of his 361 lifetime homers,
213 came on the road, only 148 at home.;    DiMaggio, of course, has a
well-documented mystique. He has been part of Americana from the '30s through
World War II, from his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, through his immortalization
in a Paul Simon '60s lyric, through recognition by a generation simply as
television's "Mr. Coffee," so he needs no press agent. Indeed, the number, 56,
is more indelibly carved into the American fabric than are 37 1/2-23-36 --
M.M.'s numbers, of course. In this way J.D. and M.M. were alike: No numbers
could describe their impact or come close to it.;    I wish that all who will
see them Tuesday night could have seen DiMaggio and Williams play. As DiMaggio
said, Williams was "the greatest hitter I ever saw." Williams, in turn, has
many times said DiMaggio was the "greatest player of my time.";    Few,
however, put the two on the same plane as hitters. Meet one of the few.;   
Williams, too, had a tough park to hit homers in as a left-handed batter. But
Fenway was a great park for all-around hitting. And Ted tore it up for
average, hitting over .400 at home in three different full seasons.;    When
Williams hit .406, his home average was .428. In contrast, DiMaggio's best
average was .381, good for the 1939 batting title. The difference: DiMaggio
hit .416 on the road, but Yankee Stadium confined him to a mere .350.;   
Williams once was asked by his son if DiMaggio was as good a hitter as he was.
Ted is supposed to have explained that DiMaggio, as a right-handed hitter, had
a natural disadvantage. There was always farther to run to first base, and
most often longer distances to conquer for home runs. Anyway, it was a classy
response from Williams, and one DiMaggio deserved.;    Baseball analysis has
come a long way since the time of Joe and Ted. For example, it was only a
little over a year ago that I read the road averages of Williams and DiMaggio
for their careers: DiMaggio, .333; Williams, 328. DiMaggio scored more runs
per game, .80 to .78, and had more RBIs per game, .89 to .80, than did
Williams.;    Those statistics were surprising, and they bolstered what I long
had perceived as a most logical argument: that the park he played in shrunk
DiMaggio's productivity more than is apparent from the general statistics.
There are books that attest to that now, books that say DiMaggio, among many
great hitters, had the most negative park to play in statistically. Bill
James, considered by many the guru of the new numbers cult, came out with a
well-received book, "The Historical Baseball Abstract," several seasons ago.
But even it did not have strikeouts listed for batters. That was about as fair
to DiMaggio as it would have been to judge Marilyn on her figure alone.;   
Just a few things I thought you should know. A fanatic rests his case.;   HOME

   Dennis Day, the Irish tenor best known as
Jack Benny's comic sidekick, was remembered Thursday as a loving
man devoted to helping himself and others battle Lou Gehrig's
disease.
   Day, whose trademarks were the line ``Gee, Mr. Benny'' and skits
in which he tricked the comedian into letting him unleash his
singing voice, died at 71 late Wednesday night at his Bel Air
Estates home.
   He had never fully recovered from a fall 3{ months ago, and
returned home after treatment this week at St. John's Hospital and
Health Center in Santa Monica. The cause of death was pneumonia,
said his mother-in-law, Margaret Almquist.
   ``I'm very, very saddened by Dennis' death,'' said comedian
Jerry Lewis, national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association, for which Day worked. ``He was a great friend _ to me
and to so many during his life. When he found out that he had ALS _
the disease that led inexorably to his death _ he put all the
remaining energy he had into helping MDA fight this tragic
disorder.''
   Doctors discovered last summer that Day had amyotropic lateral
sclerosis, the nerve disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease that
causes gradual loss of muscle control. He injured his head in the
fall March 9 and had been hospitalized more than four weeks since
then, at times in critical condition.
   Day's wife and Mrs. Almquist's daughter, Peggy Margaret McNulty,
was admitted to St. John's on Wednesday for cardiac tests and was
in fair condition Thursday, hospital spokesman Armen Markarian
said. He added that doctors had not determined whether she suffered
a heart attack.
   Day played a dimwitted stooge on Benny's radio and TV variety
shows, but he was shrewd in his contract maneuvering with studios
and networks.
   ``I'm sorry about Dennis. I thought he was one of a kind,'' said
Milton Berle, who knew Day for 40 years. ``Through the tutorage of
my pal, Jack Benny, he became a very good foil and straight man
character for Jack. Show business is going to miss him.''
   ``He was a great actor and great comedian and a great foil for
Jack Benny. He was the crazy kid who did the silly things. They got
along very well together,'' said Irving Fein, Benny's former
manager who now manages George Burns.
   Day was also recalled as a family man who chose to spend time
with his 10 children rather than running with a Hollywood crowd.
   ``Warm, wonderful, loving, caring, always giving,'' is how
actress Ann Blyth remembered her brother-in-law. The star of
``Mildred Pierce,'' ``Kismet'' and ``The Helen Morgan Story'' is
married to Day's brother, James McNulty, and recalled the large
family get-togethers with their five children and Day's 10.
   ``Our family get-togethers were indeed warm and wonderful
memories to have,'' Miss Blyth said. ``To lose someone so dear is
indeed a great loss, but when you have lovely memories, it somehow
makes it easier.''
   ``Americans couldn't do any better for the likes of a role-model
husband and father than Dennis Day,'' added Ralph Edwards, host of
the old ``This is Your Life'' and ``Truth or Consequences'' shows.
   Born Owen Patrick McNulty to Irish parents in New York City on
May 21, 1917, he was graduated from St. Patrick's Cathedral High
School and attended Manhattan College with plans to enter Fordham's
law school.
   But then he learned Benny needed a singer to replace Kenny
Baker. A recording Day had made earned him an audition, and an
off-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job.
   He assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny's radio show
as a singer in 1939.
   ``Gee, Mr. Benny!'' became a trademark line on Benny's radio and
TV variety shows. The remark came from Day when a skit situation
seemed to overwhelm him.
   Besides his success as a foil, Day gained popularity as an Irish
tenor with his renditions of ``Danny Boy,'' ``McNamara's Band,''
``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and other ballads. Another Day
favorite, ``Peg of my Heart'' was a ballad he sang for his wife.
   Benny and Day began appearing on TV in 1950, and in 1951 Day
landed a movie contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he was
the only Fox contract player with television rights. He also signed
a contract with NBC, after allowing weeks of bidding between the
network and competitor CBS.
   Day is survived by his wife, a brother, six sons, four
daughters, and 13 grandchildren. Funeral services are planned next
week, depending on Mrs. McNulty's health.

   President Bush joined the celebration Tuesday
for the Trumbull, Conn., Little League baseball team that brought
the world championship back to the United States.
   Bush, a former Little League coach, used the Rose Garden
ceremony to urge the 12-year-olds to emulate the example of
baseball great Lou Gehrig.
   The U.S. Postal Service recently issued a stamp commemorating
the 50th anniversary of Gehrig's final season, and Bush presented
the original painting of Gehrig to an official of the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Bush said the Trumbull team, which defeated a favored Taiwan
team at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., in
August, displayed ``a spirit which says that nothing is impossible,
in Little League or in the bigger fields of life.''
   Trumbull became the first U.S. squad to capture the title in six
years.
   Bush said the youngsters had learned ``the lessons of Little
League: lessons like friendship and generosity; like do-unto-others
and doing your best; lessons which go beyond balls and strikes and
which have made Little League a global institution.''
   Little League baseball, which marked its 50th anniversary this
year, is played by 2{ million youths in 33 nations, Bush said.
   Bush called Gehrig, a Hall of Fame first baseman for the New
York Yankees in the 1920s and 1930s, ``a hero of mine.''
   Gehrig set a consecutive games record that still stands. The
streak ended when Gehrig was struck by the paralyzing disease that
bears his name.
   Even in the face of that fatal ailment, Gehrig told a crowd at
his retirement in Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, ``I consider
myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''
   ``That story has become an American parable. What an example for
these kids,'' said Bush, adding that Gehrig spent much of the last
two years of his life counseling youngsters as parole commissioner
for the city of New York.
   ``He showed, like Little League, that what matters is how we
conduct ourselves off, as well as on, the field,'' Bush said.
   Bush shook hands with Coach Tom Galla and his entire squad.
   ``You truly are No. 1,'' the president said.
   The Trumbull team has been invited to appear in uniform Sunday
at the second game of the World Series between San Francisco and
Oakland, if parents can afford the trip.
   Bush, who had hoped to see the Series himself, apparently has
decided the West Coast is too far to go to throw out a ball.
   ``I'm afraid I might not get to go now,'' he told reporters as
he left the Rose Garden.

<LEADPARA>  Watching Cal Ripken accept his most valuable player trophy Tuesday night, Tony
La Russa said he had mixed emotions.;    Ripken had continued his home-run

<MEMO>  All-Star Game  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Now that the game is over, my thoughts are that we've got to get him out,"
said La Russa, whose A's face the Orioles on Thursday. "It's bothering me,
because thinking about that takes all the enjoyment out of the game. He's had
that type of first half.";    Ripken had a monster first half -- .348 with 18
homers and 54 RBIs -- and he'll come to the Oakland Coliseum showing no signs
of letting up. The durable shortstop put on a stunning show in Monday's
home-run derby, hitting 12 of the 20 pitches over the fence, and he kept it up
Tuesday by taking former teammate Dennis Martinez deep for a three-run homer
that gave the A.L. a 3-1 lead.;    "I was concerned about being in the
home-run derby, because when you try to hit home runs, you can get yourself in
a bad habit," Ripken said. "But in hindsight, maybe the home-run derby made me
relax.";    Ripken also singled, but a chance for another three-run homer
ended when Rob Dibble came out of the bullpen and La Russa sent Ozzie Guillen
up to sacrifice as a pinch hitter for Ripken.;    "I have never had a chance
to face him," Ripken said, "and I was looking forward to the challenge. But if
ever there was a case to substitute, that was it.";    Ripken's
accomplishments this season have put his games-played streak in the
background. But the question came up again after Tuesday's performance. He has
played in 1,491 consecutive games and would break Lou Gehrig's sacred record
of 2,130 in early July 1995.;    "It's just something that's happened from a
desire to go out and play," he said. "It's created a lot of attention. My goal
now is to not play for the streak, but in my 10th year to approach it the way
I did in my first.;    "There are times when you don't feel as well as other
days, but you realize at the start of the season that you're going to have
highs and lows physically. Sometimes, your worst days physically are your
best.";    Asked if he has become a student of Gehrig, Ripken said, "I know he
was a great player and he played for the Yankees.";    To La Russa, Ripken is
a great player who plays for the Orioles. "He's having a great year and does
great things," he said.  </TEXT>

MORNING BRIEFING: IF NOTHING ELSE, THEY'LL LOOK AS IF THEY'RE A TOUGH TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kansas State football, among the worst that has played at the Division I level, 
is retooling the best way it can, for now. It's redesigning the football logo 
that appears on the players' helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Snyder, taking over a program that has won two games in the last 
three years, has decided that the snarling Willie the Wildcat insignia looked 
"a little bit like a kitten," according to Manhattan artist Tom Brookwalter. So 
he has replaced it with a stark, stylized profile, the Wildcat's mouth open as 
if to attack. 
</P>
<P>
Say what you will about Snyder, at least he's starting at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Annals of Advertising, Part II: Deion Sanders, first-round choice of the 
Atlanta Falcons, plans to have a line of fashions bearing his nickname -- Prime 
Time -- available by July. The line of leather jackets, sweat suits and 
headbands will be distinguished by a lightning bolt, apparently referring to 
another of Sanders' nicknames -- Lightning Man. 
</P>
<P>
Because Sanders has yet to prove himself in the National Football League, and 
because opposing players are glad to pounce on such arrogance, the Lightning 
Man may experience additional natural phenomena this fall. He is likely to hear 
thunder and see stars. 
</P>
<P>
Switch-pitcher: What do you say when your pitcher, who happens to be 
ambidextrous, decides to switch throwing arms in the middle of an inning? It 
happened at Alabama State University when Ricky King figured he would be better 
off right-handed against a Samford batter. 
</P>
<P>
Said the public-address announcer: "Ricky King is now making an equipment 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Lakers was born on the same day -- 
April 16, 1947 -- as what basketball first? 
</P>
<P>
But tractor-pull ratings were up: Perhaps there's hope for our civilization, 
after all. Early returns show that fewer than 1% of the potential pay-per-view 
audience tuned in to watch Robbie Knievel's motorcycle jump over the Caesars 
Palace fountain. 
</P>
<P>
The Real Prime Time: Kevin Mitchell made TV sportscasts everywhere with his 
barehanded grab of a foul fly ball last week. The San Francisco Giant left 
fielder had overrun Ozzie Smith's ball slightly and was not in a position to 
use his glove. So, with his back to the plate, he just snagged it with his bare 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Said an appreciative teammate, catcher Terry Kennedy: "He should have just 
ripped the cover off with his teeth and thrown it to the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago today: Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees did not play against 
the Detroit Tigers at Briggs Stadium, thus ending his streak of 2,130 
consecutive games played. Gehrig never played in another game. 
</P>
<P>
Perspective: Nolan Ryan long ago eclipsed Walter Johnson's strikeout total, a 
record that used to be regarded as a baseball standard, much as Babe Ruth's 
home run record was. But do you have any idea how much distance he put between 
himself and Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
Dave Anderson of the New York Times did some figuring and discovered that 
Ryan's 4,824 strikeouts (and counting) compare to Johnson's 3,508 this way. 
Relative to the other milestone, Ruth's 714 home runs, Ryan would have 980. 
When Ruth's record was broken by Henry Aaron, it was by a mere 41. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Fair Comment: Does Al McGuire live in the past a bit? Well, when 
his three-year contract as a college basketball commentator was announced, Phil 
Mushnick of the New York Post wrote, "It's worth close to $500,000 per year, or 
roughly $100,000 for every current player he's heard of." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The first game of the first National Basketball Assn. 
championship series.

<LEADPARA>  SUMMER IS the season for heroes. Few organized sports, it seems, bring forth
as many men of true grit as does baseball. I'm not talking about sluggers with
astronomical batting averages or pitchers with subterranean ERAS. No, I mean
guys who test themselves by hanging in when the going is rough. One example
might be Monte Stratton, a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox back in the '40s.
He lost a leg in a hunting accident and came back the following year to try to
pitch while wearing a prosthesis. So much of a pitcher's effectiveness depends
on balance and being able to throw his entire weight on one leg or another
that the comeback wasn't entirely successful for Stratton. But he tried, and
tried hard. That's how heroes are born.;    Another case in point might be
Jackie Robinson, the great Dodger second baseman. He was courageous enough to
confront the racism rampant in baseball just after World War II. When he
accepted Branch Rickey's offer to play for the Brooklyn Bums, he knew he'd be
reviled by bigots and refused access to some places his teammates frequented.
But he stuck it out and tore down the color barrier in our national pastime.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DIAMOND HEROES
TIP A CAP TO THE GUYS WHO BATTLE ADVERSITY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Commentary;   It seems to me;   Ruth Pittman is a Los Angeles writer, though
she remains a;  Chicago Cubs fan.;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 8/7/91,
pg. );  An opinion piece in the July 31 Mercury News incorrectly stated that
Satchel Paige was the first black pitcher in the major leagues. The first
black pitcher was Dan Bankhead. The article also stated that Paige was 49 when
he joined Cleveland. Most baseball reference books list his age as 42. The
article also implied that Monte Stratton made a pitching comeback in the 1940s
with the Chicago White Sox. His comeback was in the minor leagues.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And who can forget Lou Gehrig's farewell speech of July 4, 1939? Stricken
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (now known as Lou Gehrig's disease), an
invariably fatal illness that was already sapping his strength, he declared
himself "the luckiest man on the face of the earth" when he tipped his cap to
the crowd for the last time. There was a hero.;    One of my favorite examples
of grace under stress among the boys of summer is Jim Piersall, center fielder
for the Boston Red Sox. In the early '50s, Piersall suffered a nervous
breakdown and was publicly derided by fans and sports writers alike. He put up
with the humiliation, underwent treatment and returned for several successful
seasons. (OK, so he played for the Chicago Cubs. That doesn't necessarily mean
his therapy wasn't completely effective.);    No discussion of baseball heroes
would be complete without Leroy R. "Satchel" Paige, a man whose pitching feats
have never been equaled. He threw 3,000 games, including 300 shutouts. Because
he was black, he was denied the right to play in the majors until 1948, when
he joined the Cleveland Indians. He was 49 years old when he became both the
first black pitcher and the oldest rookie in the big leagues. Even
non-baseball fans may remember it was Paige who said, "Don't look back.
Something might be gaining on you.";    More recent years have produced
another pair of heroes, both pitchers: Dave Dravecky of the San Francisco
Giants and Jim Abbott, a California Angel. Dravecky was stricken, mid-career,
with cancer in one of the major muscles of his pitching arm and had to submit
to surgery. Just a little more than a year after that trauma, he returned to
the game to pitch seven great innings for the Giants, helping them to win
their division title. But the arm broke again. Recently it had to be
amputated. After the operation, Dravecky said, "It's wonderful to be free of
pain." Some kind of heart, eh?;    Abbott's story is just as valorous. The
young pitcher was born with no right hand, but that didn't stop him from
pursuing his dream of becoming a player in the majors. He learned to pitch as
a left-hander, holding his glove under his deformed right arm. The instant he
releases the ball and in less time than it takes to tell about it, he slides
the glove onto his left hand so he's ready for any fielding play. These are
just some of the players who make us realize why football, soccer, or
basketball will never replace baseball as our national pastime. These heroes
of summer make baseball what it is.  </TEXT>

JIM MURRAY: OLD-TIMER STRIKES BACK AT COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1930, something like 57 National League batters batted over .300. One of 
them batted .401. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, only four National League batters hit over .300. The league champion 
hit .313. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, every member of the champion St. Louis Cardinals starting lineup 
batted over .300. Last year, most teams didn't have any batters over .300. 
</P>
<P>
The late Fresco Thompson used to recall ruefully the year he hit .324 for the 
Philadelphia Phillies -- and batted eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, the year Bill Terry batted .401, the second-place hitter, Babe Herman, 
batted .393. The third-place hitter, Chuck Klein, batted .386, fourth was Lefty 
O'Doul at .383 and fifth was Fred Lindstrom at .379. Terry got 254 hits, Klein, 
250 and Herman, 241. 
</P>
<P>
The most hits in the National League last year was Andre Galarraga's 184. 
</P>
<P>
Hack Wilson drove in 190 runs for the Chicago Cubs in 1930. The league leader 
last year was Will Clark of San Francisco with 109. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Were there giants in those days, runts in this? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball scholars have been uneasy with these figures, this discrepancy, for 
years. It is not possible for them to conclude that the batters of a 
half-century ago were that much better than those of today. There must be an 
illogical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Their "explanation" makes Bill Starr see red. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Starr is not a nostalgia buff. Bill Starr is not one of those 
Ty-Cobb-was-better-than-Pete-Rose guys. Bill Starr was an owner of the San 
Diego Padres in the '40s and '50s before the major leagues came to California. 
He was a player in the '30s, briefly a catcher for the old Washington Senators 
(now the Minnesota Twins). 
</P>
<P>
Starr's outrage is not directed at those who would say that today's players are 
as good as yesterday's. He concedes that. What brings him off the wall is the 
notion promoted by those who would hold that yesterday's players were no good 
-- and that they can prove it with computers. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the pitchers couldn't get them out. But the computers blow them 
away. Starr has written a book titled "Clearing The Bases -- Baseball Then And 
Now," and he points to the following paragraph taken from another book ("The 
Hidden Game Of Baseball") as an example of rewriting history by floppy disk. 
"If Ty Cobb's career had taken place . . . in 1976," those authors have 
written, "his lifetime B.A. (which was actually .367) would have been only 
.289. Rogers Hornsby (lifetime .358) and Joe DiMaggio (lifetime .325) would 
have achieved identical .280 marks. Bill Terry, Lou Gehrig and Tris Speaker 
would be average to mediocre hitters at .271, .269 and .265, respectively. The 
Babe's (Ruth's) .262 (Babe actually hit .342) would be a disappointment, though 
better than Al Simmons' .260 (Al hit .334 with the bat but not the bytes) or 
Honus Wagner's .251 (Honus had better luck in person, too, .329)." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that 1930 was a bumper year for base hits (the National League 
batted .303 for that year while last year's average was .248), Starr blames the 
decline in hitting on a number of observable (not computerized) phenomenas, 
most notably the strikeout. It's become endemic in the big leagues. Big 
leaguers struck out 25,098 times in 1987, compared to a two-league average of 
only 7,517 in the '20s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern ballplayer seems to have no knowledge of the strike zone," Starr 
laments. "Babe Ruth had a big reputation as a striker-outer, but he struck out 
only 79 times a year on the average. DiMaggio struck out only 27, Ted Williams 
only 46. Gehrig struck out only 49, even homer sluggers such as Mel Ott struck 
out only 48 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson averaged 129 a year and put the strikeout record 600 above 
everyone else. He struck out 171 times one year. Wilver Stargell struck out 122 
times a year. Mickey Mantle struck out an average of 105 times a year, and Mike 
Schmidt strikes out 117. Babe Ruth isn't even in the top 25 in lifetime 
strikeouts anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Starr disputes the notion a strikeout is "a nice clean out." It doesn't result 
in a double play or worse, it's not as humiliating as a popup. But, says Starr, 
"It kills a rally. It raises the morale of the pitcher. Nothing is more 
counter-productive to the winning of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Starr points out that "in 1987, there were 41 players who struck out more than 
100 times. By comparison, in the entire 20 years from 1920 through 1939, 100 or 
more strikeouts occurred only 10 times." He points out that Cobb only struck 
out 24 times the year he hit .401 and that George Sisler struck out only 14 
times the year he hit .420. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth never struck out 100 times. Reggie Jackson had 100 or more strikeouts 
18 times in his career. "That's why he only batted .263," Starr explains. 
Mantle fanned more than 100 times eight seasons and more than 90 in four 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Starr takes issue with the notion a lively ball produced the orgy of base hits 
in 1930. Starr argues that the goal of baseball was never to "juice up" a 
baseball, only to make it more uniform. He says, on the contrary, that after 
1930, the National League changed the cork center of the ball and raised the 
seams, which resulted in a dramatic drop in that league's offense (Hack Wilson 
went from 56 homers to 13 and from 190 RBIs to 61 but bathtub gin may have had 
as much to do with it as baseballs). And it turned the National League into a 
curveball league that really wasn't competitive with the power-hitting American 
League for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Starr thinks, in addition to not knowing the strike zone, players are not 
seasoned in the minor leagues the way they used to be -- and should be. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Bill Starr takes on the computer rewriters of history on a 
You-had-to-be-there basis. He points out, for example, that Pythagorean 
principles don't apply to psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Robinson was a comparable example. His batting statistics were not 
overwhelming, and he hardly rated among the most outstanding defensive players 
in baseball history. But he, like Cobb, was an intimidator on the basepaths. He 
put pressure on the opposition, he compelled defensive changes in their play. 
Infielders were made to move closer to their bags, thus producing larger holes 
in the infield. To prevent Robinson from stealing, pitchers were compelled to 
alter their natural deliveries and selection of pitches. All of this favored 
the hitters on his club." Computers cannot pick this up, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
Bill proves his point convincingly. But, you don't really need a book when 
someone comes up to you with a whole bunch of printouts to tell you Babe Ruth 
would only hit .262 and Honus Wagner, .251. All you really have to do is say, 
"Gid oudda here!"

<LEADPARA>  WHETHER old, new, odd or mod, catalogs are of great interest to serious
collectors, and are useful for the vast amount of invaluable information they
contain.;   By studying old-time department store catalogs, for instance, one
can easily date and identify numerous items and objects found in antique shops
and shows today.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CATALOGS PROVIDE PEEK AT PAST, CLUES TO PRESENT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Also collectible (and very revealing) are the countless post-auction
catalogs, which are profusely illustrated along with detailed descriptions of
the pieces pictured, and which include a prices-realized list revealing what
the items' sold for. Many such catalogs relate to particular antiques or
collectibles such as dolls, toys, buttons, folk art, toy trains, advertising,
art, golf and fishing items, photographs, books and everything else from
silver to sports memorabilia.;   Speaking of sports memorabilia, catalogs for
the Historic Comiskey Park Auction earlier this month already are collectors'
items in their own right (picturing White Sox and old Comiskey Park
memorabilia) and are available with a prices-realized list (while supplies
last) for $8 postpaid from Leslie Hindman Auctioneers, 215 W. Ohio St.,
Chicago, Ill. 60610; (312) 670-0010.;   S.F. auctions rare treasures; Another
important sports-related auction catalog that no doubt will become a
collectors' item is the "Treasures of the Diamond" catalog for the Sept. 4
sale at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel of 100 of the rarest baseball
memorabilia items.;   The items include Lou Gehrig's 1938 New York Yankees
road flannel jersey, estimated to bring $150,000 to $175,000; a Honus Wagner
1909 baseball card, $100,000 to $125,000; a bat autographed by Babe Ruth, Mel
Ott and Jimmie Foxx, $25,000 to $30,000; a Lou Gehrig autographed game-used
bat, $35,000 to $40,000; and a 1941 Detroit Tigers home jersey worn by Hank
Greenberg, $70,000 to $80,000.;   They will be offered at the Fairmont by
Richard Wolffers Auctions Inc., 133 Kearny St., San Francisco 94108. The
descriptive full-color catalog (one can bid from by phone or mail) is
available from Wolffers (while supplies last) for $10 postpaid. Half the
catalog proceeds will benefit former players and their families who have
fallen on hard times. For additional auction information, call (415)
781-5127.;   Still another important sports memorabilia catalog was one for
the Copeland Collection of Important Baseball Cards and Sports Memorabilia
auction held last March at Sotheby's. It pictured and described 873 incredibly
rare and outstanding sports-related items and was offered for $35 with a
prices-realized list. Any existing copies can be ordered by phoning Sotheby's
subscription department at (800) 444-3709 or its Chicago office, (312)
664-6800.;   Post-auction sale catalogs and their prices-realized lists can be
obtained from Debbie Schwartz, The Catalog Kid, 555 Old Long Ridge Road,

<TEXT>
   Singer Dennis Day remained
hospitalized in critical condition today after injuring his head in
a fall at his home last week, a hospital official said.
   No change was reported in Day's condition during the weekend and
he remained in critical and unstable condition today, said a
nursing supervisor at St. John's Hospital.
   Day, 71, fell at his Bel Air-area home Wednesday and complained
of a severe headache in the emergency room. He underwent surgery
after tests showed bleeding in the brain.
   Day was diagnosed last July as suffering from amyotropic lateral
sclerosis. The progressive nerve disorder, also known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, causes a loss of muscle control.
   Day, who was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City, began
his career with comedian Jack Benny in 1939. An accomplished Irish
tenor, Day also was known for playing the innocent foil to Benny's
irascible character on television and radio.

RUTH BROUGHT BASEBALL ROARING INTO THE '20S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy years ago today, a first-year outfielder for the New York Yankees hit 
his 30th and 31st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a 
doubleheader at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
So what? 
</P>
<P>
So, George Herman (Babe) Ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season. 
In the next several weeks, he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home 
runs, too. 
</P>
<P>
He was on his way to a home run record that, in 1920, was almost beyond belief 
-- he would hit 54, then 59 in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Reference points: When Ruth hit 54 in 1920, the second-highest total in 
baseball that year was 19, by George Sisler. Only one other team in the 
American League that year hit more than 44 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit his 30th homer that afternoon, it was the 138th of Ruth's career, 
making him, at 25, the all-time home run leader. Many baseball historians claim 
today that Ruth's 1920 and '21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by 
any hitter in baseball history. And many even believe either season was 
superior to his more famous 1927 season. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth played in only 142 games in 1920, yet drove in 137 runs. His home run 
percentage that season was 11.8%, compared to 1927, when it was 11.1% as he hit 
60 in 151 games. 
</P>
<P>
But most impressive of all, Ruth's slugging percentages in 1920 and '21 were 
.847 and .846. Neither figure has ever been approached. In fact, a slugging 
percentage higher than .704 has been achieved only 20 times, eight by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever. His .772 mark for 1927 is 
No. 3. No. 4 is Lou Gehrig's .765 in 1927. Ruth and Gehrig are on the top-20 
list 11 times. The most recent player to make the top 20 was Ted Williams, who 
hit .731 in 1957 to rank 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth joined the Yankees after the 1919 season, when Boston sold him to New 
York. In his last Red Sox season, playing in 130 games, Ruth was 9-5 as a 
pitcher, and hit 29 home runs -- then a record -- and drove in 114 runs as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1920, no 20th-Century player had ever hit 30, 40 or 50 homers in a 
season. Only three had ever hit 20, and one was Ruth. Three late-19th Century 
players hit between 20 and 27 home runs, but some of those, it is believed, 
were inside-the-park homers, many coming in fenceless ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1920, no one had ever seen this kind of home run production. As recently 
as 1918, Ruth co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
And people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches. The Yankees, who after two 
more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark -- Yankee Stadium, 
a.k.a. "The House that Ruth Built" -- became the first team to draw 1 million 
fans in a season, in 1920. They drew 1,289,422, breaking the previous 
attendance mark by 380,000.

Baseball brings out the satirist in some, the sentimentalist in others. The 
game itself is so rich in costumed imagery, so rife with colorful personalities 
and vivid vocabularies, that a goofball film such as "Major League" truly might 
be more documentary than parody. At the same time, the game is so steeped in 
tradition, so evocative of heartfelt childhood memories, that a storybook fable 
such as "Field of Dreams" makes a straight-faced, strait-laced pitch that 
baseball is as everlasting and reliable as anything in our lives, and just 
about gets away with it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever eternal appeal baseball does have, it clearly is a pastime this nation 
cannot seem to do without. Even those who do not follow the box scores, who 
could not tell AB from R from H, must agree that in an often-confusing world, 
baseball gives us undeniable winners and losers, telltale statistics, 
occasional pageantry and various degrees of tragedy. In person, someone could 
be captivated so much by a baseball game's simple choreography as to make 
keeping score completely unnecessary. Baseball is a dance in baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly this explains why Hollywood cannot resist cranking out movies such as 
these new ones, movies that show polar-opposite sides of the sport. Even 
baseball in its rawest form -- playing catch with your old man -- becomes the 
central image of "Field of Dreams," same as it is in "The Natural," proposing 
the game as a natural extension of family love, as important as baby's first 
step or daughter's first date. 
</P>
<P>
So, if we are willing to follow and swallow all this, we might also go along 
with every other preposterous notion of "Field of Dreams," which supplies an 
amazing assortment of malarkey presenting baseball as a magical, mystical world 
where wishes can come true. Those of us who do not buy into this sweet movie's 
premise undoubtedly will be painted as unfeeling, unimaginative ogres who 
deserve all the kung fu and car-chase cassettes we can rent. People do take 
their baseball seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, I already can see producers scrambling for new baseball-related ideas. 
No doubt some will draw from real life -- as well they should. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Cincinnati Reds' major-league baseball team also owns a St. 
Bernard named Schottzie, who is pictured in the team's yearbook, has full run 
of the ballpark and someday might even -- it would not surprise us a bit -- 
inherit the ball club. Now would that make a movie or what? 
</P>
<P>
The best player in the history of the Cincinnati Reds, a man who now manages 
them, recently has been accused of everything from betting on games to selling 
bogus copies of his memorabilia to exchanging hand signals from the dugout with 
gamblers in the stands. Now would that make a movie or what? 
</P>
<P>
A young outfielder for the Kansas City Royals, who is playing quite well at 
present, quit baseball for the entire 1985-86 season because of a nervous 
disorder, later diagnosed as Tourette's syndrome, which gave him something 
tantamount to a classic case of stage fright. Some cruel souls joked that he 
had turned into a twitch-hitter. Now would that make a movie or what? 
</P>
<P>
A young left-handed pitcher for the California Angels has no fingers on his 
right hand, but won the final game of the Summer Olympics in South Korea and 
reached the majors in his first year out of college. He says the only real 
problem he has in life is fastening his left cufflink. 
</P>
<P>
C'mon. Ideal film fodder, right? Almost right up there with that Lou 
Gehrig-Gary Cooper "I'm the luckiest man on the face of the (echo) 
Earth-Earth-Earth" stuff. 
</P>
<P>
So, expect a deluge of baseball comedies, baseball dramedies, maybe even 
baseball biographies. Danny Glover as Hank Aaron. Bruce Willis as Roger Maris. 
James Woods as Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad that guy Joe E. Ross ("Ooh! Ooh!") from the old TV series "Car 54, 
Where Are You?" is not around anymore. What a Yogi Berra he would have made. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how baseball is no longer profession non grata in the minds of producers. 
Or was it ever? Supposedly, baseball themes were to be avoided at all costs, 
the key word here being costs. Baseball was anathema to women and lacked appeal 
internationally, the reasoning went. Baseball movies were going, going, gone. 
Yet, within a year, "Eight Men Out," "Stealing Home," "Bull Durham," "Major 
League" and "Field of Dreams," a virtual murderers' row of baseball-related 
movies have been released. 
</P>
<P>
Well, nobody knows anything, right? Nobody knows what will sell. Perhaps we are 
due for a glut of sports pictures, and not just about baseball, either. More 
basketball films. "Amazing Grace and Chuck II: Amazing's Revenge." More 
football films. "Everybody's All-American II: He's baaaaack!" More 
track-and-field films. Florence Griffith-Joyner, starring in: "Stripped to 
Run." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and don't forget white boxers. Hollywood can't get enough of white boxers. 
Never mind those Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson nobodies. Commission a few more 
scripts about the white guys who fought them. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, though, is the game for which Americans reserve a heartfelt love, a 
tenderness almost, that likely will keep the national-pastime movies coming. 
Clearly there will always be some love interest ("Pride of the Yankees," "Bull 
Durham") or some tragedy ("Bang the Drum Slowly," "The Natural") or some other 
subplot that will keep the film from being entirely about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Also of continuing importance is The Happy Ending. Moviegoers must leave the 
theater smiling, evidently, to enjoy today's feel-good baseball films. Someday 
when they remake "Pride of the Yankees" or "Bang the Drum Slowly," miracle 
cures undoubtedly will save Lou Gehrig and Bruce Pearson just in time. Too bad 
nobody had the nerve to make "The Natural" the way Bernard Malamud wrote it in 
1952, with Roy Hobbs striking out in the end. Then again, Malamud's Hobbs put 
himself into the hospital by gorging himself on greasy food. Not exactly a 
leading man's dream scene. 
</P>
<P>
I love most baseball movies, even the bad ones. Mainly the bad ones. One hasn't 
really lived life to the fullest until one has seen William Bendix as Babe 
Ruth, rushing a sick puppy to a veterinarian's hospital, still wearing his 
Yankee uniform. One hasn't really lived at all until one has seen William 
Bendix as Bill (Two-Call) Johnson in "Kill the Umpire," in which he mistakenly 
uses somebody else's eyedrop prescription just before a big game, then ends up 
seeing double and calling every play twice. (The umpire: "Ball! Ball!" The 
catcher: "I hoid ya da foist time!") 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, I save a special place in my heart for Ray Milland in "It Happens 
Every Spring," pitching baseballs dabbed with a top-secret solution that makes 
them repellent to wood. (Why he didn't have 27 strikeouts a night, I'll never 
know.) I also look forward to Late, Late Show telecasts of "Angels in the 
Outfield" (which has nothing to do with Reggie Jackson or Chili Davis), "The 
Kid From Left Field" (the original peanut-vendor movie) and "Rhubarb" (Ray 
Milland, again, in the story of a baseball franchise willed to a pet cat. And 
you think it can't happen with the Cincinnati Reds.) 
</P>
<P>
Non-sports movies have been known to slip in a ballpark scene, here or there. 
Let us not forget Doris Day causing Berra, Maris and Mickey Mantle to be 
ejected from a Yankee game in "That Touch of Mink." Or, Lana Turner catching a 
foul ball at Dodger Stadium in "Bachelor in Paradise," while a very young Vin 
Scully calls the action. Or, Matthew Broderick ditching school and nabbing a 
souvenir at Wrigley Field in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Or, Glenn Ford gunning 
down Ross Martin on the pitching mound of Candlestick Park in "Experiment in 
Terror." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball also has been very good to television, if for no better reason than to 
provide a colorful means of identifying a character's favorite team. Tom 
Selleck in a Detroit cap. Brian Keith in a New York cap. Victor French in an 
Oakland cap. Jamie Farr in a Texas cap (actually intended to represent Toledo). 
About the only guy you never see in a baseball cap is Ted Danson on "Cheers," 
and he is supposed to be an ex-pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Guess he just 
hates covering that hair. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose we will be seeing more and more baseball-themed screenplays and 
teleplays in months to come, and I have some ideas. Or, rather, I have stolen 
some ideas. Stealing is permitted, remember, both in Hollywood and in baseball. 
After all, "Bull Durham" dealt with an aging catcher in his last season, a wild 
pitcher with a great fastball that he cannot control and a first baseman who 
practiced voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
"Major League" deals with an aging catcher in his last season, a wild pitcher 
with a great fastball that he cannot control, and a first baseman who practices 
voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
One film was released first. For all I know, the other film, might have been 
written first. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's baseball's oldest argument: Who's on first? 
</P>
<P>
I intend to pitch to the major studios a sequel to "Pride of the Yankees," with 
Arnold Schwarzenegger as Lou Gehrig. Only this time, Lou's last line is: "I 
vill be back!"

IN RED'S BOOK, TEAMS OF TODAY DON'T RATE WITH ALL-TIME BEST

<P>
Just past the midpoint of a season in which the Dodgers are shakily defending a 
World Series championship, baseball's best teams might be the Oakland Athletics 
and San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
But how do these two compare with the better champions of the century? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, they don't -- at least not yet -- if you're consulting Arthur E. 
(Red) Patterson, who has been following the game for about 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently an Angel executive, Patterson, 80, began as a sportswriter for 
the old New York Herald-Tribune before moving to the New York Yankees and then 
the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"My test is continuity -- the ability to repeat as a pennant winner," he said, 
noting that there have been no repeaters in the decade since 1977-78, when the 
Dodgers and Yankees met in successive Octobers. "I think baseball is more 
interesting now than ever, and the clubs today are better balanced than they 
were 30 or 40 years ago, but there has only been one great team in the last 
quarter century." 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, was Charlie O. Finley's 1972-73-74 A's, who rank third in 
Patterson's all-time top 10. 
</P>
<P>
On top are two Yankee machines, the 1926-27-28 clubs with Babe Ruth and Lou 
Gehrig, and the multiple champions of the 1930s and early '40s, the players who 
won so many pennants and World Series that they inspired an American League war 
cry: "Break up the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
In Patterson's top 10 -- a collection of 10 champions that all meet his 
criteria -- the first five are the 1927 Yankees, 1939 Yankees, 1974 A's, 1951 
Yankees and 1922 New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
His next five: the 1929 Philadelphia A's, 1955 Dodgers, 1963 Dodgers, 1907 
Chicago Cubs and 1916 Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest regret is that there isn't room there for the St. Louis Gas House 
Gang," he said, naming the 1934 Cardinals 11th and following with the 1913 A's, 
1931 Cardinals, 1940 Cincinnati Reds and 1936 Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding irony of baseball in this century, Patterson said, is the 
increasingly high quality of the modern game combined with the possibility that 
there won't be another team to compare with those now in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Free agency and the draft have made it a new game," he said, mentioning the 
revolutionary baseball changes that took root in the 1970s, tearing apart, 
among others, Finley's Oakland champions. "These days, you can't put together 
dynasty-type players and keep them together. 
</P>
<P>
"The draft is the biggest change. In the great days of the Yankees in the '30s, 
'40s, and '50s, all they had to do was identify the nation's outstanding young 
prospects -- that is, scout them -- and sign them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to scout them, draft them, and sign them. That makes an enormous 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
He noted Joe DiMaggio, a Hall of Famer who might have gone to a Yankee rival in 
a 1930s draft. 
</P>
<P>
Or, Patterson said: "If there'd been free agency, someone would have picked him 
off, most likely, for a million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the game is now, if you think you win the pennant with one more proven 
player, you grab him as a free agent -- and there goes somebody else's 
dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson approves, nonetheless, of the modern way. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is a fan's delight today," he said. "Baseball has never been so well 
played. The talk about the dilution of talent with so many teams is just plain 
wrong. Baseball could easily expand again. 
</P>
<P>
"Pro basketball and football have siphoned off some players, of course. That 
never used to happen. And TV has knocked out some of the minor leagues. But 
despite all that, there's so much talent now and such good coaching, in the 
colleges as well as the minors, that the game keeps getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the superstars who are remembered from the past. Today, every baseball 
roster is stronger, down through the 23rd or 24th man, than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson is an expert on what used to be. He's been a close student of the big 
leagues since age 12, when an uncle took him to his first game, a Dodger-Giant 
game at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946 he joined the Yankees for eight years as road secretary, publicist and 
home run tape measurer. Then he spent 20 years with the Dodgers in Brooklyn and 
Los Angeles before taking over as president of the Angels in 1975. He remains 
an Angel consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who went to night school at New York University when he was working 
days for the Herald-Tribune, was one of four sons of a New York area mill 
superintendent. He and his wife, residents of Fullerton, have five children, 15 
grandchildren and a great grandchild, most of them baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 1907 Cubs and 1916 Red Sox are the only great teams of the century 
that he never personally scouted. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1927 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
The quotes are Patterson's: 
</P>
<P>
"You can always get lucky once. So you've got to do it more than once to meet 
the test of greatness. Secondly, you can't embarrass yourself in the World 
Series. Those are the two things I think about first. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '20s, (Manager) Miller Huggins' Yankees qualified in both respects, 
winning three straight pennants and then the World Series in '27 and '28." 
</P>
<P>
Along with most old-timers, Patterson ranks the 1927 Yankees as the century's 
No. 1 ballclub, in large part because Ruth hit his 60 home runs that year, and 
Gehrig hit 47 and batted in 175 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1927, the Yankees won 110 games in a 154-game season. That's dominance, 
that's greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's teammates in the 1927 outfield were Earle Combs, whose lifetime-best 231 
hits led the league that season, and Bob Meusel, whose .337 batting average and 
.510 slugging average were also career bests. 
</P>
<P>
For the second of many times, first baseman Gehrig played every game. Second 
baseman Tony Lazzeri hit .309. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dugan was at third for the 1927 Yankees, with Mark Koenig at shortstop, as 
Pat Collins caught 92 games, Benny Bengough 31. 
</P>
<P>
Waite Hoyt was the ace of an old staff that put it together for one last season 
in 1927, which turned out to be the final year in the majors for Urban Shocker 
(18-3), Dutch Ruether (13-6) and Bob Shawkey (2-3). Shocker died at 38 a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast there was a rookie reliever, Wilcy Moore, who in his only big 
season in baseball had a 19-7 record with a 2.28 earned-run average in 50 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt, who began his 21-year career in the majors in 1918, led the league's 
starters with 22-7 and 2.63. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Pennock, the Knight of Kennett Square, who started his 22-year career in 
1912, finished 19-8. He was never to win that many again. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth came back to hit 54 home runs in 1928, when he and Gehrig led the league 
with 142 runs batted in apiece. That sort of reprise impresses Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
1939 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
"Gehrig was still a force on the club when the Yankees started another streak 
under (Manager) Joe McCarthy, and this time they won pennants in 1932, '36, 
'37, '38, '39, '41, '42 and '43. That's four straight in the '30s and three 
straight in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"And in all those seasons, they lost only one World Series. The Cardinals beat 
them in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball had never seen such a dominant team. In the four World Series played 
from 1936 through 1939, the Yankees lost a total of only three games. They 
swept the Cubs in '38 and the Reds in '39." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through McCarthy's streak, the 1939 club was his best, in Patterson's 
view. 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio led the league with a career-high .381 batting average in 1939, when a 
rookie outfielder, Charlie (King Kong) Keller, hit a career-high .324 and when 
the other outfielder, George Selkirk, hit .306. 
</P>
<P>
At third base, Red Rolfe had his biggest year, batting .329 and leading the 
league in runs, hits and doubles. Joe Gordon was at second, Frankie Crosetti at 
short. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame catcher, Bill Dickey, hit .302. 
</P>
<P>
Red Ruffing (21-7) matched his peak season on a staff with four other pitchers 
who each won 12 or 13 games -- Atley Donald, Lefty Gomez, Bump Hadley and Monte 
Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
"The most poignant of baseball stories began one night in the spring of 1939 
when Joe McCarthy walked in to talk to the writers in the dining room of the 
Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us: 'I think I have a story for you fellows. Lou Gehrig has asked to 
come out of the lineup.' 
</P>
<P>
"Lou had played in 2130 consecutive games. He never played again. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, nobody knew how ill he was, although we thought it was serious. 
When he carried the lineup card out to the plate that summer, he could hardly 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
"This inspired the team. Even with Babe Dahlgren instead of Gehrig at first 
base, that became the greatest Yankee team of my time. 
</P>
<P>
"That first game at Detroit was typical. Guys were crying as they walked out to 
bat. That day they would have beaten any team that ever played. They beat 
Detroit, 22-2." 
</P>
<P>
1974 OAKLAND A's 
</P>
<P>
"These days you can no longer build a ballclub the way Charlie Finley built the 
1970s A's -- which was also the way the old Yankees were put together. 
</P>
<P>
"Shrewd scouting was the main thing it took. You didn't have to compete with 
other front offices in the draft. And you didn't have to worry about losing a 
superstar to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
"So the 1974 A's were baseball's last great team. Except for the A's, there 
hasn't been a great one since the 1963 Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who did much of the scouting himself, helped round up a group that won 
a record five straight division championships for Oakland starting in 1971. The 
string only ended in 1976 when the entrepreneurial era ended in baseball as the 
draft and free agency took hold, balancing up the teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The (1972-73-74) A's met the two tests for greatness we've been talking about. 
In successive years, they won more than one pennant, distancing themselves from 
the field. And they never disgraced themselves in the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
In fact they won pennants and three World Series in three consecutive years, in 
addition to winning five straight division titles. 
</P>
<P>
The 1974 A's, with Catfish Hunter pitching a league-leading 25 wins with a 
league-leading ERA, went on to blitz the Dodgers in a five-game Series. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, Ken Holtzman and John (Blue Moon) Odom won the last three straight that 
October, after which neither the A's nor baseball was ever the same. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pitchers' team that Finley built. Hunter averaged more than 22 wins in 
1972-73-74, while Holtzman averaged nearly 20. Vida Blue, after winning 24 as a 
rookie in 1971, slumped to 6-10 the next season after a long contract squabble 
with Finley, but came back to win 17 in 1973 and 20 in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Relief star Rollie Fingers appeared in a league-leading 76 games in 1974, and 
in three years averaged 20 saves. 
</P>
<P>
In all three years, there was only one .300 hitter, outfielder Joe Rudi, who 
got up there only once in an era when .318 could lead the league. 
</P>
<P>
The power came from Reggie Jackson, who averaged 29 home runs. Otherwise, 
Finley got a lot of mileage out of players such as Sal Bando, Bert Campaneris, 
Gene Tenace, Dick Green and catcher Ray Fosse. 
</P>
<P>
The managers, who ran Finley's errands, were Dick Williams in 1972-73 and Alvin 
Dark in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
1951 YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
"In Casey Stengel's first five years as manager, the Yankees won five pennants 
and five straight World Series in 1949, '50, '51, '52 and '53. No one has ever 
done that before or since. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Casey came back in 1955, '56, '57, and '58 and won four more pennants -- 
that's nine in 10 years -- plus two more World Series in '56 and '58. Finally, 
after winning his 10th pennant, he lost the seventh game of the 1960 World 
Series when Bill Mazeroski hit that home run for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey, I feel, has been under-appreciated as a baseball man. He wasn't just 
the most colorful baseball character of the last 50 years, he lived the game 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This was appropriately recognized at his funeral service. I'll never forget 
that instead of 'Nearer My God to Thee,' they played 'Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame' all the way through Casey's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came out of the chapel, it had been raining a bit, and there was a 
rainbow in the sky -- a colorful rainbow in L.A., mind you. One of the other 
pall bearers saw it at the same time I did and whispered, 'I see Casey's at it 
already.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of Stengel's seven world champions, Patterson's favorite was the 1951 team -- 
DiMaggio's last in the majors and Mickey Mantle's first. And in retrospect, 
Stengel's managing or his jesting, whatever, was at least as helpful as the 
contributions of his batsmen. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a .300 hitter in an outfield in which DiMaggio and Mantle both 
finished in the .260s. In fact, on a team with Yogi Berra catching and 
infielders such as Bobby Brown, Phil Rizzuto, and Johnny Mize, the only .300 
hitter was a rookie infielder, Gil McDougald. 
</P>
<P>
The club was carried by pitchers Ed Lopat (21-9), Vic Raschi (21-10), and the 
Superchief from Oklahoma, Allie Reynolds (17-8), who pitched two no-hitters 
that season -- inducing Ted Williams to loft a foul ball to Yogi Berra for the 
last out in the second one after Berra, on a three and two count, dropped 
Williams' first high foul. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1951 World Series, camaraderie or team spirit -- or Stengel -- may have 
been decisive, along with the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants won the first game after beating the Dodgers in the playoff on 
Bobby Thomson's home run. The Yankees won the second, and the third was 
supposed to be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day when Eddie Stanky kicked the ball out of Phil Rizzuto's 
glove, and the Giants went on to win, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"On the fourth day it rained, and the papers were full of Stanky's dropkick. 
The Yankees read and heard everything they could stand about that kick." 
</P>
<P>
When they came out for the fourth game, they came out in one group, like a 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, baseball players straggle out two or three at a time -- but not those 
Yankees. Not for that fourth game at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all together when they came down the narrow stairway from the 
clubhouse way out (in center field), and together they walked all that long way 
in. That's the only time I ever saw that. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the writers and, I'm sure, some Giant fans looked at each other and 
said, 'It's all over.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was. In the last three games, the Yankees won three straight." 
</P>
<P>
The winning pitchers: Reynolds, Lopat and Raschi. 
</P>
<P>
1922 GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
"Casey Stengel was a player in 1922, and a pretty good one, on one of (Manager) 
John McGraw's best teams when the New York Giants swept the Yankees in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants had won the Series the year before, and they (were to) win it again 
in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
"McGraw won four straight 1920s pennants but lost the 1924 World Series to the 
boy manager, Bucky Harris, when Walter Johnson pitched all 12 innings for the 
Washington Senators in the seventh game." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1922 Giants had come over in trades from Cincinnati, Philadelphia, 
Boston or other National League teams, either that year or a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Stengel, a left-handed outfielder who came from Philadelphia in 1921, led the 
1922 Giants with a career-high .368 batting average, though he only played in 
84 games. 
</P>
<P>
That was a season when every Giant starter hit .322 or better except third 
baseman Heine Groh, who trailed at .265. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Frank Snyder and third baseman Dave (Beauty) Bancroft joined Stengel 
with lifetime bests. The other infielders, Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch, the 
Fordham Flash, and George (Highpockets) Kelly, weren't far behind. Nor were the 
other outfielders, Irish Meusel, Bob's brother, and Ross Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching was hardly world class although Rosy Ryan (17-12) led the league 
with a 3.01 ERA. Steadier in the first World Series ever broadcast, Giant 
pitchers held Babe Ruth to a composite .118. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEXT FIVE 
</P>
<P>
1929 PHILADELPHIA A'S: Owner-Manager Connie Mack's best team, with five Hall of 
Famers including catcher Mickey Cochrane in his prime, won the World Series in 
1929 and 1930 from the Cubs and Cardinals, respectively, before losing to the 
Cardinals in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
On Mack's great 1929 club, which beat the Cubs in five games, left fielder Al 
Simmons hit .365 and led the league with 157 runs batted in. The other three 
Hall of Famers were pitcher Lefty Grove (20-6), and infielders Jimmie Foxx and 
Eddie Collins. 
</P>
<P>
1955 DODGERS: After losing five World Series to the Yankees in '41, '47, '49, 
'52, and '53, the Dodgers, then in Brooklyn, lost the first two games of the 
'55 Series. But they fought on, and, in Brooklyn's biggest day, finally won a 
seventh game from the Yankees as Johnny Podres pitched a 2-0 shutout. Jackie 
Robinson was at second base after playing three other positions as a regular in 
three previous World Series: first base, third and left field. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Roy Campanella became a three-time National League MVP as Gil Hodges, 
Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese and rookie pitcher Roger Craig, a Series winner, 
also helped make that team memorable. 
</P>
<P>
1963 DODGERS: Manager Walt Alston led the Dodgers to seven pennants in '55, 
'56, '59, '63, '65, '66 and '74 and to four World Series victories in '55, '59, 
'63 and '65. The '63 champions, who swept the Yankees in four games, were 
builder Walter O'Malley's favorite team. The catcher was Johnny Roseboro. The 
inspiration came from shortstop Maury Wills. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale pitched a 1-0 shutout in the '63 'Series, in which the Dodgers 
yielded but four runs in four games. Podres was a 4-1 winner. After Sandy 
Koufax won the first and fourth games, he was named MVP. "Why me?" he asked. "I 
gave up three of the four runs." 
</P>
<P>
1907 CHICAGO CUBS: Baseball's first great team, with Manager Frank Chance, the 
Peerless Leader, at first base, won consecutive pennants and two World Series 
in 1906-07-08. Pitcher Mordecai Peter Centennial (Three Finger) Brown was 26-6, 
20-6 and 29-9 in those three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
On the 1907 team, a four-straight World Series winner, the answer to baseball's 
most enduring trivia question was Harry Steinfeldt. The question: Who played 
third base on the team that immortalized the double play with (Joe) Tinker to 
(Johnny) Evers to Chance? 
</P>
<P>
1916 BOSTON RED SOX: To win their second straight World Series, the Red Sox, 
managed by Bill Carrigan, needed a strong pitching performance in the second 
game -- which went 14 innings, still the Series record. Happily, they had a 
left-hander on their staff who could do it. 
</P>
<P>
He was Babe Ruth, who pitched all 14 innings. Ruth hit .272 in 1916, with three 
home runs. As a pitcher he was 23-12, the year before his career-high 24-13.

   Singer Dennis Day has returned home
after spending five weeks at a hospital for treatment of a head
injury following a fall at his home, a spokeswoman said.
   Day, a mainstay on Jack Benny's radio and television shows, was
released from St. John's Hospital and Health Center Wednesday
night, and is ``home with nurses and all the necessary trappings,''
said his publicist, Kitty Davis.
   ``He is alert and conscious but he's having therapy,'' Ms. Davis
said Thursday. ``The main therapy is that he's home with his
family.''
   Doctors determined last summer that Day, 71, was suffering from
amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a progressive nerve disorder also
known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
   On March 9, Day fell at his Bel Air-area home, and complained of
a severe headache immediately afterward. A diagnosis showed
bleeding in the brain and Day underwent emergency surgery.
   Day, born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City, began his
career with Jack Benny in 1939. In addition to singing, he often
played a dim-witted straight man in comic dialogues with Benny.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the last inspection, made at the end of the 1989 season, Mr. Cal Ripken Jr. 
performs in his 1,250th consecutive game in the sport of rounders. 
</P>
<P>
That is an awful lot of consecutive games, proof of which is only two others in 
the majors have pulled off more. 
</P>
<P>
One is Lou Gehrig, 2,130. The other is Everett Scott, who, at 148 pounds, rolls 
out of Bluffton, Ind., to play shortstop for the Red Sox and Yankees and logs 
1,307 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
If an achievement could look over its shoulder, the one of Scott's would be 
troubled today by an advancing Ripken, who, conditions willing, could be 
passing 1,307 a couple of months after the start of this season. 
</P>
<P>
In roughly 5 1/2 years, Ripken could be passing Gehrig. Since Cal is 29, such 
an achievement is possible, although you nibble for a price on it in the 
neighborly state of Nevada and you're going to come up with numbers pretty big. 
</P>
<P>
In the training quarters of the Baltimore Orioles, this entertainer stands 
before you, looking more like a tight end than a shortstop. You develop an 
image of Ozzie Smith, 160, skipping, with dancer's grace, right and left. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in Ripken, you see a guy they might call Horse, coming to bat last year 
646 times, not counting the times he walks, sacrifices and gets hit by pitches. 
</P>
<P>
You ask Cal about the streak and he is reluctant to talk, mainly because he 
doesn't see it as anything out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
One draws wages, he says, to play in 162 games, and Cal feels it is newsworthy 
only if one plays in fewer. 
</P>
<P>
The point he makes is interesting. Do you read, for instance, that Wade Boggs 
is going to play? It makes a news item only if Ripken doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Now you ask the manager of the Orioles, Frank Robinson, how he would react if 
Ripken began to look tired. Would Frank make a dramatic speech about a 
commitment to the team and bench Cal for a game? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," he answers. "One game isn't that important. For me to take him out of 
the lineup would require, on his part, an incapacitation." 
</P>
<P>
"What if he had a hobble?" Frank is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A hobble makes a tougher decision for a manager than an incapacitation. But 
don't look for me to set him down." 
</P>
<P>
A thought then occurs to Frank, and he smiles thinly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to wait until the streak reaches 2,129," he says. "And then I'm 
going to tell him, 'Hit the pine. You need rest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Fox, the former big league manager, now scouting for Houston, is 
kibitzing. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ripken is my guy, I shift him to third," he says. "It's much easier on a 
player's body. You don't move as much at third as you do at shortstop. And you 
don't figure in the breakup play. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how often shortstops and second basemen get creamed on the 
breakup? Big as Ripken is, some rabbit may nail his knee going into second, and 
that's the end of the Cal's streak." 
</P>
<P>
The streak of Steve Garvey, fourth longest in baseball history, came to a 
finish not when a rabbit slid into Garvey, but when he slid into a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended about nine years of unbroken play, during which Garvey, sensitive to 
disrupting flukes, wouldn't attempt household repairs, especially on a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether a guy has a streak going or not, that's the way a big leaguer should 
operate," says Robinson. "Don't paint the house or fix the roof. Pay a 
craftsman. And never beat a bellman out of a tip by lifting your own luggage." 
</P>
<P>
Since Ripken began the streak in 1982, Baltimore has played 12,412 innings, of 
which Cal has been in the game 12,380. 
</P>
<P>
You are not looking at a guy coddled in his mission. He was removed the last 
four innings of the final game last year. In another game, an umpire removed 
him in the first inning, after divergent opinions over a called strike. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only time during his big league existence that Cal has been kicked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken eats normally, sleeps normally, exercises normally. He doesn't stand on 
his head in a darkened closet, doesn't chant, doesn't carry religious symbols, 
or require chiropractic ministrations. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't meditate, listen to hypnotic tapes, practice kung fu, or get 
friction massages. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles had better keep an eye on this fellow. He might need observation.

<HEAD>Singer Dennis Day in Critical, Unstable Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis Day, a tenor who appeared on
Jack Benny's TV and radio shows and recorded ``Danny Boy'' and
other Irish ballads, was hospitalized in critical and unstable
condition, a hospital spokesman said Friday.
   The 71-year-old singer whose trademark line was a sprightly
``Gee, Mr. Benny!'' was brought to the emergency room Wednesday
after a fall at his home, said Armen Markarian, a spokesman at
St.John's Hospital and Health Center.
   While in the emergency room, Day complained of a severe
headache. A scan showed bleeding in the brain and he was rushed
into surgery, Markarian said. ``He's been in critical condition
since then,'' the hospital spokesman added.
   In July, Day's spokesman announced that he had been diagnosed
with amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative nerve disease
also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. However, Markarian said Day's
condition did not appear to be related.
   Day was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City. His singing
career began in 1939 as a naive kid with a golden voice on Jack
Benny's radio show.
   He recorded such songs as ``Peg of My Heart'' and ``Clancy
Lowered the Boom,'' and appeared in several films, including ``Buck
Benny Rides Again,'' ``Music in Manhattan,'' ``One Sunday
Afternoon'' and ``The Girl Next Door.''

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five months have passed since Pat DeMar was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's 
disease, a paralyzing and fatal illness, and still her hands have not betrayed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"The disease takes everything away," she says. "What I can still do, though, is 
paint." 
</P>
<P>
Her canvas isn't made of paper but of cloth. DeMar paints abstract swirls and 
fluid lines on vintage tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
She has learned to hold the paint brush differently to overcome the weakness in 
her hands, but the illness has not interfered with her deft strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities -- walking, driving, cooking a meal -- are no longer possible. 
She speaks with difficulty. She's been told by doctors that she is dying -- a 
prognosis she refuses to accept. She is 32. 
</P>
<P>
It's the painting that gets her up in the morning. To her, it's not a pastime 
but a passion that she discovered when she was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar's hand-painted tuxedos bring a new twist to formal wear. She typically 
paints the jackets' lapels, and sometimes the front and backs. Often, she'll 
adorn the tuxedo with some kind of whimsical decoration. 
</P>
<P>
One of her hottest new creations is a tuxedo garnished with miniature utensils, 
which she has dubbed "the dinner jacket." 
</P>
<P>
She decorated another tuxedo with seashells on its lapels, a reflection of her 
love of the ocean. She also created a white tuxedo shirt with shells on the 
front bib. 
</P>
<P>
"One Texas oil man wanted a tux with oil derricks painted all over it," DeMar 
says. She obliged. 
</P>
<P>
For Christmas, she'll introduce holiday tuxedos arrayed with miniature toys, 
ornaments and red chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
One can see the influence of her favorite artists on the tuxedos. An ivory 
tuxedo she named after artist Jackson Pollock comes with Pollock-style 
splatters of inky black paint on the front and down one side of the back. Her 
love of Oriental art reveals itself in a cream-colored tuxedo with an Oriental 
woman painted on the front. 
</P>
<P>
"My designs really come from the past," she confesses. 
</P>
<P>
Her customers include top celebrities. Bette Midler bought a tuxedo with 
multicolored abstract swirls on the lapels. Diana Ross bought a short, white, 
bolero-style jacket with an abstract design, then called and ordered a skirt to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Fairchild has the so-called rosebud jacket, featuring tiny fabric roses 
on the lapels and swirling stems on the front. Mick Jagger, Rob Lowe, Paula 
Abdul and Candy Spelling own DeMar's designs, and Donna Rice bought a pair of 
her painted earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her customers are women 25 to 50, but men also buy her clothes. Her 
art-to-wear sells all over the world -- without any promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't advertise," DeMar says. "As an artist, I'm kind of a recluse. I just 
like to paint and get my product out there." 
</P>
<P>
The tuxedos are available to store buyers in garment showrooms in Dallas, Los 
Angeles and Chicago. In Orange County, she sells her line through The Look and 
Apropos in Fashion Island, Newport Beach, and From Laguna in Laguna Beach. The 
tuxedos cost from about $300 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
Her partner, Michael Laux, helps her run what has become a $200,000-a-year 
business, handling all of the production work so that she can design the 
clothing from her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now my legs," she says. With his assistance, she continues to create a 
new line of clothing four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The pair work out of an upstairs studio off Coast Highway in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of DeMar's desire to paint, to embellish the ordinary, is everywhere: 
Painted tuxedos fill a circular rack in the center of the room. In one corner, 
there's a stack of bracelets she made from hand-painted fiberglass -- the same 
material used to make surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were discontinued -- most people don't want bracelets that big," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Her line of aluminum copper earrings hangs on one wall like miniature artworks. 
DeMar hand-paints each large earring with a colorful abstract design. The 
earrings have sold at Nordstrom, Bullock's and Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to painting tuxedos, she decorates baby clothes, shoes, kimonos, 
hats, T-shirts, chiffon tops and silk skirts with her flowing brushwork. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar and Laux have a factory in El Toro where garments are cut, sewn and made 
ready for the artist's hand. The vintage tuxedos come from second-hand stores 
and dealers all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar has also started painting vintage velvet coats. She decorated one black 
velvet swing coat with a serpentine design in gold on the lapels and sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
She has been painting clothes for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working in oil and acrylic, doing large canvases, when a bunch of people 
started doing hand-painted clothing. It looked so interesting, I started doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
She later began manufacturing the clothes to paint on. Only the disease has 
slowed her down. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I got sick," she says. "First I started limping, and then I 
started dropping things." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors first assumed that she had a pinched nerve, but her condition worsened. 
She could no longer walk. Laux took her to leading neurologists, who made the 
diagnosis -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, a degenerative 
nervous-system disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fatal and not real pretty," DeMar says. Doctors told her there was no 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not giving into that," Laux adds. "We're not subscribing to that 
diagnosis. There's no acid test for Lou Gehrig's disease." 
</P>
<P>
DeMar has refuted the stark prognosis and now undergoes alternative treatments. 
She travels to Santa Cruz and Idaho for ancient Chinese medicine, including 
deep tissue massage and acupressure. The treatments are painful and costly 
(they are not covered by insurance), but DeMar says she's starting to feel 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Five months ago, I could barely talk," she says. "And I couldn't open my 
hands. Now I've gotten a lot of that back." 
</P>
<P>
An art auction is planned for Nov. 4 at Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach to 
help pay her medical costs. Prominent artists will donate their work for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, DeMar will continue to rise each morning and reach for her 
paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard on me," she says. "A lot of the business used to be meeting with 
buyers and finding out what people wanted. Now, I'm a lot more limited. 
</P>
<P>
"What keeps me sane is for me to come here and paint. If I didn't have this, 
I'd go home and die."

At least the American League East produced baseball's only pennant race last 
season. That's about all this declining division did. While the West was 
aggressive in raising young players, the East grew lazy and seemed content to 
occasionally pick up an old free agent or two. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the balance in the league tilting the other way, the AL East is -- 
why, why? -- still doing the same thing. Keith Hernandez, Jeff Reardon and Tony 
Pena were All-Stars once, but not these days. The one team that followed the 
West formula was Baltimore, and that was out of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto probably has the best team. Milwaukee should contend, while Baltimore 
and Boston might slide. New York is middle-of-the-pack, followed by Cleveland 
and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto Blue Jays 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays finally found the right manager and the right ballpark. Spurred 
by sellouts and Cito Gaston, Toronto recovered from a 12-24 start and outlasted 
Baltimore in the stretch. This year, the Blue Jays could draw 4 million at the 
SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (17-8) heads a staff that led the division with a 3.58 earned-run 
average. Tom Henke (8-3, 1.92 ERA, 20 saves, 148 strikeouts in 151 innings) is 
the closer in a bullpen full of decent middle-relief and set-up men. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell, at 30, is the last remaining member of what was once projected as 
baseball's best outfield. He can poke (.297, 18 home runs, 104 RBIs). Fred 
McGriff's 36 homers led the league and Kelly Gruber (.290, 18 HR) is solid. 
Mookie Wilson (.298, 12 stolen bases in two months) became the rage in Canada; 
at 34, he can still play, provided Junior Felix (46 RBIs in a platoon role) 
doesn't keep him out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Watch rookie John Olerud. He has recovered from a brain aneurysm and scouts say 
he can really hit. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Brewers 
</P>
<P>
Free agent Dave Parker brings his bat to an offense that always comes down to 
Robin Yount and Paul Molitor. But can the Brewers solve their two omnipresent 
problems -- injuries and fielding? 
</P>
<P>
Yount (.318, 21 HR, 103 RBI) beat out Ruben Sierra for the MVP award and 
continued his march toward 3,000 hits. At age 34, he should get there next 
season and after that, maybe 4,000? 
</P>
<P>
Molitor (.315, 27 SB) and Parker (97 RBIs for Oakland) are good. So could be 
rookie outfielder Greg Vaughn (26 HR, 92 RBIs in 110 games at Class AAA 
Denver). 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bosio was by far Milwaukee's best starter. He was 15-10 with a 2.95 ERA 
and was the only AL East pitcher among the league's top nine ERA leaders. Dan 
Plesac (2.35 ERA, 33 saves) is outstanding and he kills left handers. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers ruined themselves with a league-leading 155 errors. They made 33 
miscues at shortstop and an awful 28 errors in the outfield. Furthermore, their 
players always seem to be hurt. Jim Gantner and Dale Sveum are hoping to 
recover this season. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Orioles 
</P>
<P>
From the minute they rallied to beat Roger Clemens on opening day, it was a 
special season in Baltimore. The Orioles tied the 1967 Chicago Cubs for most 
victories (87) after a 100-loss season and showed the fourth-greatest 
improvement in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
A wild pitch from brilliant rookie reliever Gregg Olson in Toronto on the final 
weekend stalled Baltimore's bid to go from worst-to-first. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles project great things for Ben McDonald, the No. 1 pick in last 
year's draft. Olson (1.69 ERA, 27 saves) did not blow an opportunity until late 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken's streak might be taking its toll. He hit 21 homers and drove in 93 
runs, but his slugging percentage declined for the sixth straight year. Ripken 
is more than halfway to Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, the Orioles showed the value of catching the ball. They set 
a major-league record with a .996 fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Red Sox 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox went out and bought some of everything -- Shane Rawley to start, 
Jeff Reardon to relieve, Tony Pena to catch. Maybe those are improvements, 
maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Clemens (17-11, 3.13) is the only sure thing in the rotation. Reardon (31 
saves despite a 4.07 ERA) joins Lee Smith (25 saves, 3.57 ERA) and gives Boston 
too much of the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs (.330, .430 on-base average) reached 200 hits for the seventh 
straight season. This year, there's no controversy, either. Dwight Evans (20 
HR, 100 RBIs) is great at 39 and Mike Greenwell (.308, 95 RBIs) and Ellis Burks 
(.303, 21 SB) helped Boston lead the majors with a .277 average and 774 runs. 
The Red Sox will really miss Nick Esasky (30 HR, 108 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankees 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees led the majors in victories during the 1980s, even though it was 
the first decade since Ruth &amp; Gehrig in which they did not win a World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield is the big question. If he can stay healthy and regain his form, 
it's a major plus. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly (.303, 23 HR, 113 RBIs) again rebounded from his characteristic 
slow start. He might do even better this year if he works out a new contract 
with George Steinbrenner. Steve Sax (.315, 43 SB) was a free agent who turned 
out well. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got hooted when they signed Pascual Perez to be their ace. But look 
at his numbers -- 28-21 with a 2.80 ERA in his last three years. Andy Hawkins 
(15-15), Chuck Cary (4-4) Clay Parker (4-5) and newcomer Tim Leary (8-14 in 
Cincinnati and Los Angeles) fill out a garden variety rotation. 
</P>
<P>
New York's 4.50 ERA was second-worst to Detroit in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Indians 
</P>
<P>
The Indians have not finished within 10 games of first place since 1959. This 
year, there's optimism in Cleveland, but is it justified? 
</P>
<P>
The Indians got catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., the minor league player of the year, 
plus promising Carlos Baerga and usable Chris James from San Diego for Joe 
Carter (35 HR, 105 RBIs). Probably not that bad a deal, considering Carter 
would have left after this season as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Candiotti (13-10, 3.10 ERA), John Farrell (9-14) and Greg Swindell (13-6, 
3.37 ERA) can form the nucleus of a nice rotation for new Manager John McNamara 
if they're healthy and consistent. Doug Jones (32 saves) and Jesse Orosco (2.08 
ERA in 69 games) give the Indians a decent lefty-righty bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians hope free agent Keith Hernandez, 36, can help on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Tigers 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers were so bad last season that even eternal optimist Sparky Anderson 
had to take some time off. There's no reason to think Detroit will be much 
better this year. 
</P>
<P>
Free agents Lloyd Moseby (.221 in Toronto), Tony Phillips (.262 in Oakland) and 
Cecil Fielder, who returned from Japan, join Larry Sheets as newcomers. That's 
the best Detroit could do. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Trammell slumped to .243 and Lou Whitaker hit just .251. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Morris, the top winner in the 1980s, fell to 6-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers slid from 88-74 in 1988 to 59-103 last year, their first 100-loss 
season since 1975.

MORNING BRIEFING: ORIOLES' TETTLETON TIMED IT PERFECTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton, the terror of American League pitchers, figures he broke in 
with the Baltimore Orioles at the perfect time -- not this season, when they're 
leading the East Division, but on May 9 last year when they were 4-26 and 
headed for their worst season ever. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Cal Ripken had been fired, and the front office was more concerned 
about punching tickets out of town for Eddie Murray, Mike Boddicker and friends 
than worrying about who was already in town. Terry Kennedy was in a terrible 
slump, and the new manager, Frank Robinson, was ready to try a new catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton hit .261 with a career-high 11 homers and 37 RBIs, and the Orioles 
couldn't have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting to play, and I could go through a slump, get hot, whatever," he 
told Richard Justice of the Washington Post. "No one gave me a second thought." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tettleton shares the American League lead with 13 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this is all a dream but whoever wakes me up is going to get 
punched," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Considering how long the Lakers have been sitting around waiting 
to see who they'll play in the NBA Finals, should they have an advantage over a 
team coming off a tough series? 
</P>
<P>
Down on the Farm: New York Mets fans and some players think Manager Dave 
Johnson should send rookie phenom-turned-flop Gregg Jefferies, 21, down to the 
minors for everybody's good. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Mantle also said it might be a good idea. At 19, it happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was Jefferies, I wouldn't mind," Mantle said. "Me and Casey (Stengel) 
both cried. Now that I look back, it was the best thing that could have 
happened. I was so scared. Can you imagine going from Joplin (Mo.) to New York 
City?" 
</P>
<P>
When the Mets brought Jefferies up last September for a look, he was so good he 
was almost voted rookie of the year, hitting .321 for 29 games. Now he's at 
.187. 
</P>
<P>
Mantle relates. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see I wasn't doin' as good as Casey said I would," Mantle drawled. "He 
had me, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio rolled into one. I was striking 
out so much it was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Even down at Kansas City, then a Yankee farm club, Mantle batted 21 times 
without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Concidentally, Willie Mays was hitless in his first 21 at-bats with the Giants 
and shrilled to Leo Durocher, the manager, "Send me down, Mr. Leo. I can't hit 
up here." 
</P>
<P>
Mays stayed and Mantle returned. As it turned out, both did all right. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: History says . . . not necessarily. Five times the Lakers have 
gone 4-0 in the next-to-last round, and three times they have met teams coming 
off 4-3 series. In 1968, they lost to the Boston Celtics, 4-2, but in '82, they 
defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 4-2, and in '87, they beat the Boston Celtics, 
4-2. Last season, the Lakers came off consecutive seven-game series against the 
Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks -- and beat the Detroit Pistons in seven. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Coach Rick Pitino, who has taken over the scandal-ridden University 
of Kentucky basketball program: "We're all a little embarrassed about being on 
the cover of Sports Illustrated. . . . You'll see us on the cover once again, 
but it will be cutting down nets."
