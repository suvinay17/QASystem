FT  01 FEB 92 / The men who would play God: Unravelling the secrets of the
human gene could transform human life. But, as Clive Cookson reports, the
possibilities for abuse of this power are terrifying

<TEXT>
OF ALL the 20th century's scientific revolutions, the one with the greatest
potential to transform life is the unravelling of the secrets of human
genes.
Within 15 years, scientists expect to have decoded all of the 100,000 genes
which are the blueprint for individual development from the foetus until old
age. This information, encoded chemically in every living cell, is stored in
spiral ribbons of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is analogous to
computer tapes. Decoding them could confer an almost Godlike power to
foresee - and to change - an individual's destiny. The question whether this
power will be used for good or ill raises deep moral issues which will
result in fierce debate as the technology improves.
The practical development of genetics is, however, no more advanced than
electronics was in the transistor age of the 1950s. Very few people have had
direct personal experience of genetic medicine and research efforts in
hundreds of laboratories around the world are dimly understood in the world
outside.
The genetic revolution has therefore made little impact on the public
imagination, says Dr Steve Jones, head of the genetics department at
University College, London, who tried to bring home its implications in his
recent Reith Lectures on BBC Radio. 'But it is going to have a dramatic
effect on many people. You will be able to get a good idea of what you are
going to die from and when - or, to be more positive, to know what diseases
you are at risk from so that you can avoid them.'
Research is coordinated through an international programme, the Human Genome
Mapping Project, with total expenditure estimated at Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.6bn) over the next 15 years. Since gene mapping started in the early
1970s, the pace has accelerated rapidly. Scientists have now located about
2,700 genes, including those responsible for common inherited diseases such
as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and haemophilia - and the gender gene
which determines whether the embryo becomes a boy or girl.
Practical uses of the new genetic knowledge fall into two broad categories:
testing or screening to discover whether an individual is carrying
particular genes; and therapy to change a person's genes. Both bring the
promise of immense medical benefits, balanced by terrifying possibilities
for abuse.
The embarrassing record of some of their predecessors in the 1920s and
1930s, who were only too willing to advocate eugenics and racial purity, has
increased the reluctance of today's researchers to speak publicly about
human genetic engineering.
'There has been an astonishing shift of attitude over the last 50 years,'
Jones observes. 'In the 1930s, when genetics was a series of prejudices and
our information was effectively zero, the scientific literature was full of
proposals for eugenics. Now that we are gaining the knowledge to 'improve
the human race' people don't want to think about it.'
Pre-natal testing is already available in about the eighth week of pregnancy
for several disorders caused by single genetic defects, including cystic
fibrosis, phenylketonuria, muscular dystrophy and thalassaemia. If the
defective gene is present, the mother is offered an abortion. Extensive
genetic testing for thalassaemia, a severe form of anaemia common in the
Mediterranean region, has greatly reduced the incidence of this disease.
For those opposed to abortion, this form of preventative medicine is
unacceptable. But the medical profession regards it as morally equivalent to
 -and a great practical improvement on - amniocentesis, a cruder and more
limited non-genetic test for foetal abnormalities which is offered to older
mothers.
At the same time, foundations are being laid for genetic screening of the
general population. The UK Medical Research Council is sponsoring five
trials of screening for cystic fibrosis, the UK's most common serious
inherited disease, which clogs the lungs with a thick mucus and kills most
sufferers before the age of 30. Participants simply have to wash out their
mouths to provide enough cells to test for the defective gene.
'We are examining whether we can deliver an acceptable model of mass
screening,' says Dr David Brock, professor of human genetics at Edinburgh
University. 'Any type of screening has the capacity to disturb as well as
reassure. Being told that they are a carrier of a CF gene may be quite
upsetting to some people, however carefully they have been prepared.' Those
taking the tests are told that people carrying one copy of the defective
gene are quite healthy, but if they marry someone with the same defect the
children will have a one in four chance of developing cystic fibrosis. As
more genes are identified such ethical problems will multiply.
The main medical problems of western society - cancer, heart disease and
mental illness - result from a complicated interaction between genetic and
environmental factors. Genetic testing may reveal an unusual susceptibility
to alcoholism or schizophrenia, heart attack or lung cancer, but predictions
may be uncertain.
A pregnant woman told unambiguously that her baby will suffer from cystic
fibrosis is likely to opt for abortion. But what decision will she make if,
for example, she is told there is a one in five chance of the baby growing
up schizophrenic? For adults, genetic testing could throw up disturbing
uncertainties. If we had a full print-out of our genes, all of us would
discover that we carried several potentially lethal recessive genes (which
have no effect unless the other parent has a similar gene).
On the other hand a genetic print-out, properly interpreted, would give
everyone a personal guide as to which activities could be harmful and which
might be safely indulged. You might be told, for example, that you can eat
fatty foods freely, having no disposition to heart disease or bowel cancer,
but must avoid alcohol because you are susceptible to alcoholism. Advice
based on one's own gene pattern could be much more persuasive than today's
generalised do's and don'ts.
But unless social attitudes and the legal framework change, the
disincentives to taking genetic tests could be formidable. Those who turned
out to have bad genes could face discrimination in access to health and life
insurance, education and even employment, if the information were made
available to other people.
It is easy to imagine computer technology, including artificial
intelligence, being combined with genetic screening to draw conclusions
about people's suitability for particular jobs or careers. Large companies
may build up a genetic database of their staff and discover that employees
with certain gene combinations do well and others do badly.
That might sound an alarming echo of Huxley's Brave New World or a route to
better career counselling, depending on the point of view. Even the deepest
personal relationships could be influenced if genetic testing for disease or
compatibility were accepted in some cultures as a precursor of marriage.
Many researchers agree with Sir Walter Bodmer, director of the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund and president of the international Human Genome Mapping
Organisation, that a new legal framework is needed for genetic medicine. But
the interested parties are nowhere near reaching agreement about its
content. Life insurance executives, for example, have already objected to
the idea, proposed by some geneticists, that companies should banned from
discriminating against known carriers of genetic disease.
The need for legislation will become all the greater if genetic screening -
voluntary in today's experimental programmes - eventually becomes
compulsory.
'In the long run,' said Baroness Warnock, the moral philosopher who chaired
the highly influential Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation, 'it
seems to me inevitable that everyone will be obliged to submit to at least
some compulsory screening.'
Genetic testing will become much more appealing as researchers discover how
to correct the defects discovered. Gene therapy, which has been pioneered in
the US, involves introducing non-defective genes into particular cells to
replace the ones carrying the disease.
The first patient was a four-year-old American girl, who had to be kept
apart from other children because one defective gene in her immune system
meant that she had no natural protection against infection. In September
1990 she was given a transfusion of about a billion of her own blood cells,
to which copies of the correct gene had been added. Her immune defences are
now strong enough for her to attend school.
Since then half a dozen other gene therapy studies have got under way in the
US, and European researchers expect to launch their own trials. Last month
the UK government's Committee on the Ethics of Gene Therapy, chaired by Sir
Cecil Clothier, the distinguished lawyer, recommended approval for gene
therapy trials.
Cystic fibrosis is one of the most important targets for gene therapy
research on both sides of the Atlantic, and animal tests of potential
treatments are already under way. Scientists at the US National Institutes
of Health have used a genetically altered virus to carry correctly
functioning copies of the CFTR gene - which is defective in cystic fibrosis
patients - into the lungs of laboratory rats. If the technique works in
monkeys, too, trials of human gene therapy for cystic fibrosis could start
as soon as 1993.
All these experiments involve 'somatic gene therapy.' This corrects the
defect by adding new genes to the cells where they are needed - for example,
in the bone marrow or lungs - but the genetic change is not passed on to the
patient's offspring. 'There is widespread agreement,' said Lady Warnock,
'that such therapy is not open to moral objection.' Indeed, Sir Cecil
Clothier says that none of the religious groups - Christian, Moslem and
Jewish - giving evidence to his committee objected to somatic gene therapy.
But 'germ line gene therapy', which would affect future generations, is
generally regarded today as medically unpredictable and ethically
unacceptable. It is unlikely to be approved anywhere in the world, at least
for a few years.
An experimental procedure equivalent to germ line therapy is used to make
'transgenic' animals - for example, sheep which produce valuable human
proteins in their milk. But the technique, which involves injecting genes
into newly fertilised embryos, is too crude for use in humans. There is no
way of controlling how many copies of the new genes are taken up, nor of
directing where they are incorporated in the embryo's existing genetic
material.
However, if scientists develop a more precise technique for eliminating a
defective gene and replacing it with a correct copy, then germ line gene
therapy will seem irresistible. If, for example, it became possible safely
to eradicate cystic fibrosis for ever, it would seem absurd to screen each
generation for the defective gene.
The question then is whether we would have taken the first step down a
slippery slope, leading eventually from eradication of inherited diseases to
genetic enhancement of sought-after traits such as intelligence, beauty and
athletic prowess. Improving mankind may seem an enticing prospect. But as
Lady Warnock said: 'We all fear, and not without reason, that one day such
power might be exercised not by benevolent doctors but by political tyrants
who would use us for their own ends.'

   A team of researchers from the University of Toronto and
Immunex Corp. of Seattle reported advances in developing a
laboratory mouse to help doctors study a range of human blood
disorders from sickle-cell anemia to leukemia.
   The research extends the work on the so-called SCID mouse
being pursued by several scientific teams in the U.S. and
abroad. These mice are immunodeficient lab animals which
receive transplants of human cells to endow them with a
humanlike immune system. The goal is to adapt them for use in
studying and treating AIDS, cancer and a variety of genetic
disorders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, the growing field of SCID mouse research has been
dominated by three groups: Systemix Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.,
which is 60%-controlled by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz
Ltd.; the Medical Biology Institue in La Jolla, Calif.; and
the Weizmann Institute of Rehovot, Israel.
   The Immunex-Toronto team discovered that giving the mice a
unique combination of growth factors following bone marrow
transplant nourished the regrowth of a wide range of red and
white blood cells found in the human body.
   "This is an exciting paper, and a major advance in the
development of a humanized mouse," said Jerome Groopman,
chief of hematology at the New England Deaconess Hospital in
Boston.
   Coaxing an array of transplanted cells to take root and
mature makes the SCID mouse a potentially more powerful tool
for the study of diseases that attack different elements of
the blood and bone marrow. These might include red-cell
deficiencies like anemia and thalassemia, as well as the
malignant overgrowth of white cells that occurs in leukemia.
   The key to repopulating these red and white blood-cell
lineages was treating the mice with one or more human
proteins: human mast-cell growth factor, or Immunex's new
hybrid protein called PIXY321, a combination of interleukin-3
and GM-CSF. In some mice treated with both mast-cell factor
and PIXY321, researchers reported that the mouse bone marrow
was replaced by as much as 50% with human cells within a
month.
   Overall, the treated mice produced at least 10 times more
human cells than their untreated counterparts, the team said.
The report in this week's edition of the journal Science was
written by John E. Dick and Tsvee Lapidot and their
colleagues at the University of Toronto, along with Douglas
E. Williams of Immunex.

   Doctors hope to reduce the complications of sickle
cell disease by prompting the body to produce a substance that it
ordinarily stops making after birth.
   The experimental treatment involves the drug hydroxyurea, a
medicine approved for treating melanoma and some other forms of
cancer.
   Sickle cell victims make defective hemoglobin, the substance in
red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. In the new
treatment, doctors induced the body to make fetal hemoglobin, which
ordinarily is present in large quantities only before birth.
   But the treatment only slightly reduced anemia, a common
complication of sickle cell disease. The doctors cautioned that
more study of the drug's long-term effects and hazards will be
necessary before they know whether it will play a role in treating
the ailment.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers and colleagues
from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In seven of 10 people given the drug for three months, levels of
fetal hemoglobin in red blood cells rose by two to 10 times. This
resulted in a 25 percent reduction in the tendency of their
hemoglobin to polymerize, or form long fibers, which gives the red
cells a distorted shape.
   The doctors speculated that if they could achieve a 50 percent
reduction in the tendency to polymerize, they could significantly
reduce the complications of sickle cell disease.
   In the United States, the disease is most common among blacks,
where it occurs in about one of every 1,000 people.
   Doctors are also studying the possibility of using the cancer
drug to treat thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder.

   Genetic Defect Spotted

   In 3-Day-Old Embryo

   RESEARCHERS diagnosed a genetic defect in a three-day-old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans.

   Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today.
But the mouse experiment at a Medical Research Council laboratory in London shows genetic defects can be detected three days after conception using a new American-developed gene-copying technique.

   The experiment, applicable to many genetic disorders, involved beta-thalassemia, a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene.
It's an inherited human disorder that's been duplicated in mice.
In the experiment, mice with the defective gene were mated.
Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse.
The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells.
One cell was teased out, and its DNA extracted.

   Using the new technique developed by Cetus Corp., called the polymerase chain reaction, the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene, providing enough copies to test.
A genetic probe showed the hemoglobin gene was missing, the researchers report in the medical journal Lancet.

   In the report, two molecular biologists suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child.

   For example, infertile couples who have the woman's eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time.
When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells, a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects.
A healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective ones discarded.

   Or in other couples, the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested three days after conception and returned if healthy, or discarded if not.

   Yeast Adapted to Make

   Gene-Spliced Drugs

   AN OIL COMPANY finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast.

   In the early 1970s, when the "world food crisis" was a major worry, Phillips Petroleum Co., like several other big companies, began developing "single-cell protein," edible protein made by microbes feeding on non-edible materials.
Phillips found and improved a yeast, "Pichia pastoris," which made protein from natural gas-derived alcohol.
It also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein.
Single-cell protein never panned out, and most companies abandoned such research.

   But Phillips persisted, calling in scientists from the Salk Institute.
They've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs.
Like the bacteria used by genetic engineers, the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use.
But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus.
Thus, the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria.

   The oil company claims its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high-volume production of genetically engineered drugs.
Chiron Corp., an Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology firm, is seeing if the Phillips yeast can be used to make its genetically engineered human proteins.

   Peeking Inside Arteries

   From Outside the Body

   VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without poking catheters into the body may come out of research at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.

   Strokes, heart attacks, leg pains (intermittent claudication) and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol-rich deposits.
At present, doctors can see how badly an artery is clogged only by inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid that makes the arteries visible on X-rays.

   A non-invasive method is being researched by biophysicist Lynn Jelinski at the AT&amp;T unit.
It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when subjected to an intense magnetic field.
It's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners being used in hospitals in place of X-ray scans.

   In the Bell Labs experiments, an MRI-type of machine, synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram, rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel.
The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a "stop-motion" movie of the blood-filled vessel, (like the "stop-motion" seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing).

   The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats.
They've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood, a first for such tiny blood vessels, they report in Nature, a scientific journal.
They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow.
The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels.

   Odds and Ends

   TESTS ON 2,800-year-old mummies from Chile indicate ancient wood fires didn't produce dioxins or dibenzofurans, contradicting a theory the two pollutants today are coming from wood burning, General Electric Co. reports in Environmental Science &amp; Technology magazine. . . .
Almost 40% of schizophrenic men have an impaired sense of smell vs. fewer than 10% of schizophrenic women, reports the American Journal of Psychiatry.

Scientists reported last week they have created mice with a disorder resembling
sickle cell disease, an advance that may remove a major obstacle to developing
treatments for the disorder affecting up to 100,000 Americans. A British
research team said it has genetically engineered a strain of mice to contain
the defective hemoglobin found in blood cells of humans with sickle cell
disease.
</P>
<P>
Hemoglobin is a complex compound responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the
body.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the journal Nature, a team led by Frank Grosveld of Britain's
National Institute for Medical Research said it was able to create two
genetically engineered mice containing relatively large amounts of human sickle
cell hemoglobin in their red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
In test-tube experiments, blood cells taken from the mice were "sickled" under
conditions that would cause similar deformities in cells taken from humans with
sickle cell disease, researchers said. Other tests showed sickling also
appeared to be occurring naturally within one of the mice. However, the
researchers pointed out a major problem with their "sickle cell" mice is their
failure to develop the anemia and other symptoms characteristic of the human
disorder.

TECHNIQUE PROMISES SAFER DETECTION OF BIRTH DEFECTS

<P>
A safer, easier technique -- involving only a tablespoon of a mother's blood
taken as early as eight weeks into a pregnancy -- is being developed in Boston
to test for hidden genetic disorders in a fetus.
</P>
<P>
Now, if women are troubled by the idea of possibly carrying a genetically
damaged fetus in utero, there are only two ways to settle the question, and
both are invasive and have a degree of risk.
</P>
<P>
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling require withdrawal of fluid or
tissue from areas close to the developing fetus. Neither can be done very early
in the pregnancy. CVS has a 4% incidence of complications. Amniocentesis has a
lower rate, 0.5%.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diana W. Bianchi, a neonatologist-geneticist at The Boston Children's
Hospital and principal investigator in the research, described the new
technique as "preliminary but promising" recently at the American Society of
Human Genetics conference in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
The technique, which could become available within a few years, would test for
genetic disorders that have been identified at the DNA level -- cystic
fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, phenylketonuria, Duchenne's muscular
dystrophy -- and possibly even screen for Down's syndrome and other chromosomal
disorders.
</P>
<P>
The test relies on the presence of fetal red blood cells that "leak" from the
placenta -- the structure in the uterus that nourishes the fetus -- into the
maternal bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
By examining these cells with highly sophisticated equipment, Bianchi and
colleagues from the Harvard Medical School and the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute also hope to find clues -- or the answer -- to why a fetus can grow
without being rejected by the mother.
</P>
<P>
"If you transplanted a kidney into somebody, they wouldn't accept it, but a
baby is like a transplant," she said. "We don't know this -- and this is only
speculation -- but if the constant leakage of blood from the baby into the
mother somehow suppresses the mother's immune system, it may be related to
tolerance of the pregnancy."
</P>
<P>
When researchers obtain the mother's blood sample, they do a "density
centrifugation," which separates different cells according to their size and
weight. Then they use an antibody that recognizes certain proteins on the
surface of the cells.
</P>
<P>
The advent of a new tool, polymerase chain reaction, which amplifies genetic
material in the sorted cells and can turn a few rare cells into millions of
cells, has given the research a tremendous boost, the specialist said.
</P>
<P>
"We're taking a tablespoon of blood from the mother and looking for the
presence of the rare fetal blood cells that cross the placenta and end up in
the mother's bloodstream," Bianchi said.
</P>
<P>
"Once we identify the cells as being fetal, then we can analyze the genetic
material in the cells. So a cell from a fetus, whether it's a blood cell, a
chorionic villus sample or a skin cell from an amniocentesis, has the same
genetic information."
</P>
<P>
The benefit of the fetal cell sorting technique is that it poses "zero risk" to
the fetus, as opposed to amniocentesis "where you're sticking a needle into the
womb," or CVS, "where you're sticking a catheter into the womb," she said.
</P>
<P>
Before the technique can become available to pregnant women throughout the
country, more work needs to be done. Technical factors have to be refined, but
these are not "impossible problems," according to Bianchi.

   Medical researchers said an established anti-cancer drug
proved effective against sickle cell anemia in a small
clinical trial.
   If the results are borne out in larger studies, it could
lead to the first safe and effective treatment of the
disease, which affects 50,000 people, almost all of them
black, in the U.S. each year. The drug, hydroxyurea, has been
used to treat bone marrow disorders, skin cancer and
leukemia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the same trial, a new genetically engineered anemia
drug called erythropoietin, or EPO, yielded no improvement in
sickle cell patients, the researchers said.
   "We are very optimistic about this," said H. Franklin
Bunn, director of hematology research at Brigham &amp; Women's
Hospital, Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School. "Treatment until now has been aimed at
getting patients out of acute pain crisis" and managing
symptoms while they are hospitalized, he said. "There's no
treatment that gets at the root cause of the sickling
process." In addition to relieving symptoms, the treatment
could yield huge cost savings, he said.
   The study included just five patients, and Dr. Bunn said
it is premature for the average doctor to administer the
treatment outside of an academic medical center. The study
appears in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Sickle cell anemia, named for the shape of red blood cells
among sufferers of the illness, is an inherited disease that
inhibits blood circulation, leading to joint pain, blood
clots, long-term anemia and loss of energy. The pain usually
comes in episodes, often with "explosive suddenness," Dr.
Bunn said. Symptoms can last from two to 10 days and often
require hospital treatment.
   Hydroxyurea stimulates production of a protein called
fetal hemoglobin, which blocks the sickling of red blood
cells. The protein is prevalent in the blood during fetal
development and up to about six months after birth, Dr. Bunn
said, when the gene responsible for its production switches
off. "But the gene is still there. You can look at
hydroxyurea as a way of reawakening the fetal hemoglobin gene
and getting it to go back to work."
   The five patients in the study were initially treated with
EPO, which is currently used to treat anemia in kidney
dialysis patients and which Dr. Bunn said increased fetal
hemoglobin levels in monkeys. Then three patients were given
doses of hydroxyurea. During a subsequent period, the three
patients were given both therapies in combination.
   The three patients on hydroxyurea reported markedly fewer
pain episodes, a subjective measure of effectiveness that Dr.
Bunn said was supported by analysis of blood chemistry. "They
are less anemic, their red blood cells survive longer, they
have less jaundice and they have less sickling," he said.
   But blood analysis during periods when the patients were
on EPO, with or without hydroxyurea, indicated EPO was
ineffective. "We are disappointed that it didn't work," Dr.
Bunn said, noting that there was no effect, even at very high
doses. That could rule out at least one potential market for
EPO, which is sold by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.
   Hydroxyurea, which is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., New York, costs about $500 a year for the average
patient, Dr. Bunn said, a price that could lead to "enormous
savings" if it keeps patients out of the hospital. An eight
to 10-day hospital stay could cost up to $10,000.
   Mark A. Goldberg, also of Brigham &amp; Women's hematology
division, was principal author of the study, which included
research done at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Bone marrow transplants may cure many sufferers of beta thalassemia, a fatal
illness of young adults brought on by a genetic defect that cripples the
blood's ability to absorb oxygen, according to new research.
</P>
<P>
The technique, a radical procedure commonly used to treat some deadly forms of
cancer, was pioneered as a thalassemia treatment in the early 1980s. It
involves destroying all blood-producing cells and injecting new cells from a
donor.

But if the technique fails, the patient usually dies.

transplant, with most experiencing no complications.

   The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute has today decided
to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1990 jointly
to Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall Thomas for their discoveries
concerning ``Organ and Cell Transplantation in the Treatment of
Human Disease.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUMMARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is given for
discoveries that have enabled the development of organ and cell
transplantation into a method for the treatment of human disease.
   Joseph E. Murray discovered how rejection following organ
transplantation in man could be mastered, E. Donnall Thomas managed
to diminish the severe reaction that the graft can cause in the
recipient, i.e. the so-called ``graft-versus-host'' reaction (GVH).
In addition, Thomas could show that intravenously infused bone
marrow cells were able to repopulate the bone marrow and produce
new blood cells.
   Murray successfully transplanted a kidney between homozygous
twins for the first time. He pioneered transplantation of kidneys
obtained from deceased persons and could show that patients with
terminal renal insufficiency could be cured. The field was then
open for transplantation of other organs such as liver, pancreas
and heart.
   Thomas was successful in transplanting bone marrow cells from
one individual to another. Bone marrow transplantation can cure
severe inherited disorders such as thalassemia and disorders of the
immune system as well as leukemia and aplastic anemia.
   Murray's and Thomas' discoveries are crucial for those tens of
thousands of severely ill patients who either can be cured or given
a decent life when other treatment methods are without success.

<TEXT>
   Gene therapy, a new medical magic bullet in
the war on cancer, diabetes and many inherited disorders, could be
used on patients for the first time this fall.
   A federal panel approved the use of gene therapy for two
disorders on Tuesday and a National Institutes of Health scientist
said that if the technique works, it gives medicine a powerful new
way to cure the incurable.
   ``This is the first step in what probably will be a revolution
in medicine over the next two decades,'' said Dr. W. French
Anderson, an NIH researcher.
   A proposal by Anderson to use gene therapy to treat an inherited
immune system disorder and one by Dr. Steven Rosenberg to treat a
lethal skin cancer were approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee at NIH.
   The proposals still must be approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, but experts said the NIH panel's OK is the most
crucial.
   Anderson said the plans by his team and by the Rosenberg team
were considered experimental models for the eventual widespread use
of gene therapy.
   ``These two proposals are the best ways to demonstrate that gene
therapy works,'' Anderson said. ``From here it should open up into
a broad range of therapies for cancer, AIDS, genetic disease and
cardiovascular disease.''
   Anderson said that if he and Rosenberg can prove the concept of
using curative genes to treat disease, there already are plans to
use similar systems to treat leukemia, hemophilia, diabetes,
aplastic anemia and cancers of the colon and the kidney.
   Rosenberg, also an NIH scientist, said his system of using genes
to make tumor-fighting blood cells could be adapted to treat nearly
every type of cancer. But first, he cautioned, it has to be proven
effective in the medical trials approved Tuesday.
   ``This is only important if it works,'' he said. ``This is very
new and one can never be sure what could happen.''
   Gerard J. McGarrity, chairman of the NIH panel, called the
approval ``historic.''
   ``What we're doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines,
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal,'' he said.
``Medicine has been waiting thousands of years for this.''
   Rosenberg said researchers should know within six months after
the treatments start whether or not the gene therapy works.
   Both Rosenberg nd Anderson said they expect FDA approval of
their proposals soon and will start treating patients by this fall.
   The therapies approved by the committee both involve
manipulating the fundamental genetic pattern within cells by
inserting genes that instruct the cells to produce new proteins.
These proteins can fight the disease directly, such as with cancer.
Or the proteins could combat disorders by restoring normal hormones
or enzymes that were missing.
   To create the cells used in gene therapy, scientists first
splice the desired gene into the genetic pattern of a harmless
virus. Target cells, such as lymphocyte blood cells, are cultured
so they multiply into billions. The cells then are exposed in test
tubes to the genetically altered virus.
   The virus infects the cells and inserts its genetic pattern,
which includes the transplanted gene, into the gene structure of
the cell. The target cells and their offspring will then contain
the new gene.
   Rosenberg plans to add a gene to a blood cell called the
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL.
   This cell will normally seek out and attack a cancerous tumor,
but it is not strong enough by itself to control the tumor.
   Rosenberg earlier developed a way to remove TIL cells from a
patient, multiply them in a test tube and then return the cells to
the patient's blood stream.
   This procedure has been used in patients with malignant
melanoma, a lethal skin cancer, and about half have improved. It is
the half who died that led Rosenberg to turn to gene therapy to
improve the technique.
   Rosenberg plans to insert into the TIL cells a gene that will
command the cells to produce a protein called tumor necrosis
factor. This protein kills tumor cells by blocking them from
establishing a blood supply.
   In effect, the genetically altered TIL cell will be turned into
a factory making a tumor-killing protein inside the tumor itself.
   Anderson and his team will use a slightly different technique to
correct a condition called severe combined immunodeficiency disease.
   This rare, inherited disorder occurs in children who are born
lacking a key gene in their white blood cells. Without this gene,
the cells cannot produce called adenosine deaminase, or ADA, which
is essential for a healthy immune system.
   Anderson plans to insert into white blood cells a gene that will
make ADA. The altered cells will then cause the patient's body to
build resistance to disease.

   With impressive regularity, science is finding ways to identify apparently healthy individuals who are likely to develop a deadly or debilitating hereditary disease or to pass it on to their offspring.

   Unfortunately, science's ability to spot these diseases is outstripping by many years its ability to do very much to prevent or treat them.
This lag is creating complex medical, legal and moral dilemmas involving family relationships, confidentiality of medical data, proper counseling and much more.

   The rapidly multiplying number of people caught in this time gap between diagnosis and possible therapy requires an "interim ethic," says LeRoy Walters, a bioethicist at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.
He would like a set of principles that "allows large social institutions to avoid unreasonable harm, while at the same time protecting the liberty and welfare rights of individuals and families."

   Congress's Office of Technology Assessment has been studying the subject for many months, and it plans to issue a report late this year.

   Recombinant DNA technology is largely responsible for identifying a score of disorders with a genetic cause or important genetic component, including diseases as disparate as Huntington's and manic depression.
For many of these, predictive tests are in use; for others, the search for a valid test is continuing.

   For a few diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, scientists have located and isolated the defective gene that causes the disorder.
Once the gene has been identified, researchers can begin figuring out its function and then start searching for possible therapy.

   With many diseases, though, scientists have only identified a so-called genetic marker -- an easily located bit of DNA that is so consistently inherited with the defective gene as to leave no doubt that the person has the gene itself.
Huntington's and cystic fibrosis are identifed by markers.

   In still other instances, research is pointing toward a "genetic predisposition" to such common disorders as hardening of the arteries and some cancers.
These findings tend to be the least definitive so far, since they seem to involve a combination of several genetic factors and environmental "triggers."

   Occasionally, particularly in the case of genetic predispositions, diagnosis and testing can dictate changes in life style, diet or drugs that reduce the risk of disease.
But for many serious inherited diseases, little or no treatment exists.

   Until recently, genetic testing has had its widest impact on the birth process.
Testing of worried would-be parents before conception or testing of a fetus during pregnancy can provide welcome reassurance for some at-risk couples, but a dreadful choice -- to abort or not -- for others.
Now, though, more and more testing -- and the quandaries that go with it -- involves the health of individuals already born.
Some of the questions:

   Who Wants to Know if Early Death Is Likely?

   Symptoms of Huntington's disease usually don't appear until a person's late 30s or early 40s, but then lead to progressive nerve deterioration and early death.
Recently developed pre-symptomatic tests, using a genetic marker, can predict with 96% accuracy whether a person eventually will develop the disease.

   Surveys of people with a family history of Huntington's find high percentages saying they would like to know their chances.
The test can remove stressful uncertainty, either freeing potential victims of worry or, if positive, allowing them to decide more intelligently whether to marry, have children, change jobs -- in general, better plan their remaining healthy years.

   "Huntington's is a diagnosis I hate to make," says Gilbert Omenn, dean of the University of Washington School of Public Health.
"But so many families thank me.
They say, 'You have to understand what we have been through with the uncertainty.
Now at least we can plan to deal with what we know is really there.'"

   But testing programs under way at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Massachusetts General Hospital suggest that the percentage actually willing to be tested may be far smaller than the surveys indicate.
Of 349 at-risk adults told by Johns Hopkins that the test was available, only 65 have asked for it.
Because nothing can be done to prevent or delay the disease, many people apparently prefer to live with uncertainty than to learn they are doomed.

   Some medical specialists worry that certain people who find out they're sure to develop a late-onset disease won't be able to handle the news.
A number of people diagnosed with Huntington's try to commit suicide, and some succeed.
"Uncovering genes that regulate human vulnerability to grave illnesses such as Huntington's chorea or Alzheimer's disease could increase the incidence of suicide as well as selective abortion," says University of Illinois bioethicist Marc Lappe.

   Can a Relative Be Forced to Help?

   Genetic probes based on markers rather than defective genes require a "linkage" analysis involving blood or tissue samples from parents, grandparents and other close relatives, including at least one with the disease.
An individual seeking the test must persuade these other family members to cooperate.

   But what if a family member refuses?
Will the person wanting the test go to court to try to compel the reluctant relative, or simply hate him or her for life?
In the Johns Hopkins program, one man wanted the test, but his twin didn't.
For a long while, the father of a young man wouldn't cooperate, arguing that his son wasn't up to coping with a positive test report.

   "Suppose the person has cystic fibrosis, and you want to find out whether the siblings are at risk," says John Graham, a geneticist at Dartmouth Medical School.
"You stir up a lot of guilt within the family as soon as you ask parents or grandparents for a blood sample.
There's a lot of reluctance to cooperate."

   Occasionally a sense of guilt or shame or some other factor makes a person testing positive reluctant to tell other relatives who might themselves be at risk and need to be tested.
Philip Reilly, medical director of the Shriver Center for Mental Retardation, says the person being tested may have not only a moral but "a legal obligation to warn the appropriate relatives."
He suggests a court might "permit a woman to sue her sister for failing to warn her about a pertinent reproductive risk, the knowledge of which would have given her an opportunity to avoid the birth of a severely impaired child."

   What is a doctor's responsibility to these relatives if the patient refuses to tell them?
"I leave it in the hands of the person who is consulting me," says Dr. Graham.
"I think I am good enough to get the point across that the results are going to come out sooner or later, and that if the information isn't shared now, the eventual rift will be all the greater."

   And if the doctor can't persuade the patient?
In 1983, a presidential commission suggested that while confidentiality should be a general rule, doctors and other healthcare providers should alert relatives at serious risk, and a number of medical officials agree.
But Lori Andrews, an American Bar Foundation specialist, declares: "Many physicians want to inform relatives, but I caution them they're taking a big chance" of being sued for invading a patient's privacy.

   How Much Should Pationts Be Told?
   As with most medical procedures, a person considering genetic testing must give "informed consent" -- not just agreeing to take the test but understanding just what the test shows and how reliably, the stresses of coping with a positive result, possible treatments, and the stresses that might result from not taking the test.

   Explaining all this is demanding.
The Johns Hopkins Huntington's program, for example, gives people extensive counseling before even asking for a decision on whether they want to take the test.

   "Informed consent is an enormous problem," says Joan Marks, who oversees a Sarah Lawrence College program training graduate students to be genetic counselors.
"If a patient doesn't understand what he is being told, how can he give informed consent?
And many physicians are just not that great at communicating."

   What About Doctors Who Are Ill-Informed?
   With proper counseling so critical and genetic diagnosis developing so fast, many specialists worry that the average doctor won't stay up-to-date and will fail to inform and guide patients adequately.
Some may refer patients to genetic counselors, but as testing expands in coming years, the number of qualified counselors will almost certainly fall far short of needs.
Last year, Ms. Marks says, she had 25 graduates for 70 jobs available.

   So far, most genetic testing is conducted by university and other specialized labs.
But several biotechnology firms are hard at work on diagnostic kits for use in doctors' offices and nonspecialized labs.
Thus, far more future testing will be done by doctors and lab technicians who may not have much experience in this field, and many geneticists worry that reliability will inevitably suffer.

   But others say these fears are exaggerated.
"To practice modern medicine you have to keep up with many things -- new drugs, new equipment, new operations," Dr. Omenn says.
"Genetic information isn't all that difficult to keep up with."

   Some see a strong role for government in this area, to make sure that biotechnology firms don't oversell their tests' abilities and to ensure a high standard of laboratory work.

   Can Third Parties Insist on Tests?

   As more and better genetic probes emerge, insurance companies and employers surely will push to use them.
Employers won't want to hire or promote high-risk people likely to have late-onset disorders that will cut productivity and push up the company's health-insurance and workmen's compensation costs.
Insurers will seek to limit their risks by insisting on genetic testing as a condition of life-insurance coverage and possibly health-insurance coverage also, and then charging higher premiums or denying coverage to those likely to develop costly or fatal illnesses.
A debate is inevitable over whether such third parties should have the right to use genetic-test results and the extent to which doctors can breach a patient's privacy by giving results to insurers or employers without the patient's consent.

   Many argue that physicians must keep such information confidential.
"The right to privacy includes the expectation that genetic information will not be obtained or disseminated without the patient's consent," says Dr. Reilly of the Shriver Center.
To protect patients, he urges legislation that would limit the right of third parties to request genetic tests or to get access to the results of such tests.

   But others believe that employers and insurers are entitled to genetic-test data and that in some cases the interests of society should override individual rights to confidentiality.
For example, shouldn't airlines be free to require testing to screen out pilots with inherited predisposition to early heart attack?
"If you're a frequent flyer, you might see your safety as more important than the pilot's right to privacy," says Jason Brandt, a neuropsychologist in charge of the Huntington's program at Johns Hopkins.

   Will Everyone Eventually Be Tested?
   For the immediate future, testing will usually be done for specific individuals with family history of a disease or other reason to suspect a genetic disorder.
Most current testing uses genetic markers, and since these tests involve family members, they are too unwieldy for screening of the general population.
Moreover, present tests are still too expensive and unreliable for general screening programs.

   But as testing reliability improves and more effective treatments emerge, there are bound to be proposals to test entire segments of the population -- all teen-agers, for example.

   Already, there are pointers in this direction.
All states require routine testing of newborns for phenylketonuria, because early detection and treatment of the enzyme deficiency can reduce some brain damage.
A National Institutes of Health panel recently recommended that all newborns be screened for sickle-cell anemia; early detection and treatment can limit fatal infections.

   "There is more and more activity in state legislatures to require prenatal or newborn screening for more and more disorders, on a cost-benefit argument" that early detection and treatment can limit future costs, says Ms. Andrews.

   But many people question whether saving money is valid reason to invade a person's privacy, and contend that benefit-cost ratios must be very large to justify mandatory screening without consent.
Others argue that general-population testing is likely to produce too many false results.

   Obviously, many of the issues to be resolved in connection with genetic testing -- widespread screening, confidentiality, adequate counseling and others -- are similar to those now being debated on testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Some think policies now being developed on AIDS will set a pattern for genetic testing, despite substantial differences between the two areas.

   "AIDS is blazing this giant pathway about how much society really needs to know about all these risks," says Dartmouth's Dr. Graham.

   But Thomas Murray, director of the Center for Medical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University, is more cautious.
"All the right issues are being raised in the AIDS debate, and the right arguments are being made," he says.
"But I think the results are going to be a pretty mixed bag.
I wouldn't want them carried over" to genetic testing.

A new treatment for sickle-cell anemia -- a drug that reduces the anemia and
helps prevent the painful "crises" that mark the disease -- has shown promise
in a small, preliminary study of three patients with the disease.
</P>
<P>
In people with sickle-cell anemia, red blood cells contain an abnormal form of
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein, that can distort cells from their
normal bagel shape into a crescent or sickle shape, making them unusually
fragile and often leading to painful blockages of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
A report in last week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine shows that
the drug, hydroxyurea, can improve the survival of red blood cells and reduce
pain in people with the disease. About 50,000 Americans have sickle-cell
anemia.
</P>
<P>
The drug works by increasing the body's production of another form of
hemoglobin that is normally produced during fetal life.
</P>
<P>
Hydroxyurea has been used for about 15 years to treat chronic leukemia and
other blood disorders sometimes seen in elderly people. The report's authors
said they were excited by the findings, but cautioned that before hydroxyurea
becomes widely used for sickle-cell anemia, their results should be confirmed
in a much larger, multihospital study that would compare the drug with a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers at Harvard and Johns Hopkins medical
schools.

   Gene amplification is transforming the way doctors detect
dozens of ailments, including AIDS and cancer.
   The sleuthing technology, known as the polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR, was invented in 1983 by scientists at Cetus
Corp. and sold to Hoffmann-La Roche, a unit of Roche Holding
Ltd. of Switzerland, this summer. Popularized outside
medicine, PCR has yielded genetic "fingerprints" that have
helped to identify criminal suspects, prehistoric animals and
casualties of the Gulf War.

   But PCR is opening even more windows in diagnostic
medicine, where its ability to pinpoint genes much more
adeptly and quickly than other methods has aided researchers
in identifying the bacteria, viruses and mutant genes that
cause disease. Starting as early as next year, PCR test kits
may become commercially available to clinical labs, moving
the technology further into the medical mainstream.
   "It's changed the way we think about diagnostic medicine,"
says Jeffrey Cossman of Georgetown University School of
Medicine, which this month co-sponsored a conference on the
explosion in uses for PCR and some of the difficulties in
harnessing the technology.
   PCR involves plucking a gene from a sample of blood or
tissue through the use of DNA probes, which bracket the
target much like bookends, and then replicating it as many as
a trillion times. This bit of medical alchemy permits
detection of one cancer cell in a million, making it 1,000 to
10,000 times more sensitive than earlier techniques. That
helps to alert doctors faster to relapses after treatment and
serves as an early warning system for new viral infections
too recent to have sparked symptoms.
   The speed of the technology tantalizes doctors who track
contagious illness. In the case of tuberculosis, says Jack
Crawford of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
"rapid detection using PCR offers the possibility of early
intervention."
   Certainly, the tool isn't fail-safe. PCR produces swarms
of DNA copies that can overrun lab equipment and taint
results of subsequent experiments, leading to as much as a
30% rate of false-positive readings, warns Arthur Hooberman
of the University of Chicago. Cetus scientist John Sninsky
unveiled a new sterilization technique that can prevent such
contamination. But the opposite problem -- that of false
negative results -- occasionally troubles researchers, too.
   Some researchers also worry about some of the practical
implications of PCR's ability to detect the presence of
disease-bearing genes long before symptoms appear. "The key
question is what are we going to do with all this increased
sensitivity," says Dr. Robert Yolken of the Johns Hopkins
pediatrics department. "Will we diagnose more people who are
sick, or will we find out that everyone is carrying small
amounts of virus and do more harm than good?"
   For several years, PCR has been used to detect genes
responsible for such diseases as sickle-cell anemia. Now,
cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs, and Fragile-X
syndrome, a type of retardation, have joined the list of
genetic defects that PCR targets. The National Institutes of
Health recently funded a network of cystic fibrosis screening
projects. Johns Hopkins University geneticist Haig H.
Kazazian says he supports similar screening programs for such
blood disorders as sickle-cell anemia and thalassemia, as
well as for Tay-Sachs disease, a fatal enzyme deficiency.
   Oncologists are using PCR to detect cancer-causing genes
as well as microscopic traces of disease that can lead
malignancies to recur after treatment. They can diagnose
certain lymphomas and leukemias based on a telltale switch in
the location of certain chromosomes.
   In the AIDS epidemic, PCR has a half dozen distinct uses,
according to Gerald Schochetman of the CDC. It solved the
problem of diagnosing newborns, who carry maternal antibodies
that mask their condition in conventional tests. PCR can also
detect HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in newly infected
adults before they make antibodies. Further, PCR can help
track disease progression by measuring how much virus a
patient is carrying.
   PCR is also emerging as a tool for screening donated blood
for HIV. The American Red Cross is planning to use the
technology in its central laboratory in Washington. Says
Gerald Sandler of the Red Cross: "There are 50,000 people to
whom we've said: `You test false-positive so you can't donate
blood.' We'll put in PCR not to detect more {HIV} but to work
toward reinstating those people as blood donors."
   PCR is having a major impact on more common infectious
diseases, too. For herpes virus infections, Thomas Smith of
the Mayo Clinic says, "PCR gives us more diagnostic options"
because it can pick up such hard-to-detect herpes family
members as the Epstein-Barr virus, linked with mononucleosis
and lymphoma, and the papilloma viruses, linked with genital
warts and tumors. Dr. Yolken of Johns Hopkins says PCR can
also detect cases of virusborne diarrhea before antibodies
are produced, making it potentially easier to curb outbreaks
in hospitals and day-care centers.
   For David Persing of the Mayo Clinic, PCR has shed
unexpected historical light on Lyme disease. After combing
through insect museums, he performed PCR on tick specimens
dating from the 1940s, and concluded that the ailment was
around decades earlier than doctors had thought.
   Next month, Roche is launching clinical trials of its
first commercial PCR candidate, a test for chlamydia, a
common sexually transmitted infection, and the company hopes
to file for market approval in the first quarter of 1992.
According to Dr. Yolken, people with infectious chlamydia can
test negative in conventional tests. What's more, the company
says, its test takes only four hours, compared with two days
for other tests.
   Roche has also slated clinical trials for a second
commercial PCR venture, a confirmatory test for HIV, in the
first half of 1992. Further into the future, Roche scientists
are developing a test that can distinguish between the benign
and cancerous types of the papilloma virus.
   Roche says it owns the rights to all present and future
uses of PCR by virtue of a $300 million deal with Cetus in
July.
   Eastman Kodak Co. has asked for a preliminary injunction
to block Cetus's sale of the technology, and a hearing has
been set for Nov. 19 in Delaware. Kodak claims it retained
broad rights to PCR technology from a 1986 contract with
Cetus. Cetus terminated that contract in 1989, when it
licensed diagnostic rights to Roche.
   Would-be competitors are now developing potential
second-generation diagnostic tests similar to PCR. They
include Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., which calls
its technology the ligase chain reaction. Amoco Corp. is
working on another potential contender called
Q-beta-replicase. So promising is the market for such
gene-based tests that Thomas MacMahon, president of the Roche
Diagnostics Group, predicts, "Any major company in the
diagnostics field will want to compete."
   Roche, meanwhile, expects a bonanza from PCR. Mr. MacMahon
predicts that the world-wide market for gene-based diagnostic
tests will reach $500 million by 1995 or 1996 and double to
$1 billion by the year 2000.
   Along with opening up new treatment options for patients,
PCR may also open up business opportunities for drug
companies. Harley Rotbart of the University of Colorado,
Denver, notes that there are 75,000 cases of viral meningitis
and encephalitis annually that can leave their victims --
especially children -- brain-damaged or dead. Because there
was no practical way to test for the enteroviruses at fault
in such cases, a number of companies shelved potentially
helpful drugs.
   With PCR, "now there is a way to test," says Dr. Rotbart.
He hopes to launch clinical trials of antiviral drugs by
Schering Plough Corp., the G.D. Searle unit of Monsanto Co.
and the Sterling Winthrop unit of Kodak.

   BETHESDA, Md. -- A National Institutes of Health panel
opened a new frontier in medicine by approving the first
human tests of gene therapy to fight disease.
   One experiment cleared by the panel will enable NIH
doctors to implant genes designed to enhance the body's
ability to fight metastatic melanoma, a fatal skin cancer.
The second experiment will test the use of gene implants to
treat ADA deficiency, a rare and congenital immune-system
defect.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent years, scientists have traced a number of
inherited disorders, such as ADA deficiency, hemophilia and
cystic fibrosis, to specific malfunctions by genes, which
instruct cells to perform various tasks. At the same time,
researchers are concluding that diseases such as cancer,
diabetes, heart disease and some manic-depressive illnesses
partly result from genetic malfunctions. Thus, scientists
have begun to focus on therapies to replace missing genes or
to enhance the performance of existing genes as a possible
key to treating many diseases and disorders.
   Scientists believe that gene therapy will eventually
graduate from the laboratory to medical practice and emerge
as a common method of treating a wide range of diseases and
disorders. "In the next 20 years, we may be able to treat
some of the more common genetic diseases with gene therapy,"
predicted Robert Murray of the division of medical genetics
at Howard University in Washington. He said there would be
strong medical and commercial benefits in developing a gene
therapy for fairly widespread genetic defects, such as
sickle-cell anemia, which afflicts about 50,000 American
blacks. He also said the gene therapy eventually may treat
certain types of high blood pressure.
   Yesterday's approvals move gene therapy "from abstract
science to research and patient care," said Gerard McGarrity,
chairman of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the NIH
panel that cleared the tests. "The field of medicine has been
looking for this kind of therapy for a thousand years," he
said, calling the panel's votes "an historic moment."
   "Unfortunately, we don't know exactly what the
ramifications are," warned Mr. McGarrity, who is the
president of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in
Camden, N.J. "Nobody can say where this is going in the
future or how many applications we'll see."
   Scientists don't know for sure how -- or even whether --
human gene implants will work, much less the risks of trying
to fine-tune the body's genetic mechanism. Moreover, gene
therapy has attracted criticism from groups that worry it
could lead to pressure to tinker with genetic structures in
order to improve the human race.
   For these reasons, the NIH has put the proposals through a
rigorous review process. The Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee, a group of scientists, ethicists and lawyers, is
the last major hurdle. The Food and Drug Administration and
the acting director of NIH must still sign off on the
proposed experiments, but their approval is considered a
certainty.
   In both experiments, scientists will remove immune-system
cells from patients and grow large amounts of these cells,
called lymphocytes, in the laboratory. Then they will splice
specific genes into the cells and infuse them into the
patient. The cancer therapy will add a gene for
tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), a protein that destroys tumor
cells. The ADA therapy will add a gene responsible for the
enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). Victims of the disorder
lack ADA, which is responsible for clearing wastes from the
body.
   The tests will start in the fall on small numbers of NIH
patients who consent to take part in the experiments, which
draw heavily on gene-implant research done by French Anderson
of NIH's Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It may be some time
before scientists know how safe the therapies are and how
well they work.
   The advisory panel authorized Dr. Anderson and two NIH
colleagues, Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver, to start the
ADA therapy on as many as 10 children. The review process,
which took almost a year, was complicated by the fact that
all the test subjects will be children. In addition, there
are already two therapies available for patients with ADA
deficiency: bone marrow transplants, which only work for a
minority of the fewer than 10 children born each year in the
U.S. with the disorder; and the drug PEG-ADA, a treatment
developed about five years ago that improves immune response
in most patients. The researchers will administer the ADA
gene therapy along with PEG-ADA.
   Even though ADA deficiency is rare, it received wide
publicity several years ago from television reports of a
Texas boy who had to live in a plastic bubble to protect him
from infection and who subsequently died. Most victims of ADA
deficiency die from respiratory diseases in their youth.
   The panel authorized Steven Rosenberg of the National
Cancer Institute to test the safety of TNF therapy on as many
as 50 volunteers. In an unusual move, the panel approved Dr.
Rosenberg's proposal the first time he presented it. Members
of the panel said the quick approval came because Dr.
Rosenberg is dealing with terminally ill patients for whom
there is no therapy. In addition, Dr. Rosenberg, who has won
committee approval for two other experimental cancer
therapies, did an effective job of using new data from tests
with monkeys to address safety concerns.
   Monday, Dr. Rosenberg told the panel's Human Gene Therapy
Subcommittee that TNF has "almost been miraculous in what it
can do" in reducing tumors in mice. "Within 15 to 30 minutes
we can see necrosis and the dissolution of tumors." However,
he said that "TNF administration to humans has been an
abysmal failure" when attempted in a solution injected
intravenously.
   Now Dr. Rosenberg will insert TNF into tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes, especially grown and strengthened cells that are
designed to zero in on cancers in the body. He hopes that the
combination will produce a promising therapy.
   When administered in some earlier applications, TNF has
caused the body to begin wasting away. Dr. Rosenberg hopes
that the more targeted application will be less risky. The
point of his initial tests will be to test the human
tolerance and safety of TNF gene therapy when administered in
connection with interleukin-2, a protein made by Cetus Corp.

   Iron-Reducing Drug Is Found to Slow
   The Effects of Alzheimer's, Study Says

   Medical researchers found surprisingly strong evidence
that an old drug used to clear excess iron from the blood can
slow the mental degeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease.
   The researchers at the University of Toronto said a
three-year study found that patients given a drug sold by
Ciba-Geigy Ltd. as Desferal developed dementia problems at
about half the rate of similar patients who received no
treatment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The finding is especially intriguing, and is expected to
be controversial, because the researchers believe the drug
worked by neutralizing aluminum that often appears in excess
amounts in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.
   Several scientists, including the Toronto group, have
speculated that the aluminum plays a critical role in killing
brain cells, although many Alzheimer's researchers dispute
that hypothesis. The Toronto researchers tested Desferal
because it is a chelating agent, or chemical that draws
metals, including aluminum, out of human tissue. The finding
is the first to suggest that reducing aluminum could slow the
progression of Alzheimer's, and the first to show that any
chelating drug might be useful against the disease.
   "We believe the study provides very strong evidence that
aluminum plays a significant part in the development of the
disease, and that there may now be a way to slow its effect,"
said Theo Kruck, one of the researchers whose report appears
today in the Lancet, a British medical journal.
   There is no approved medicine for treating Alzheimer's
disease, although Warner-Lambert Co. is seeking government
approval to sell in the U.S. a drug called THA, or Cognex.
   Some Alzheimer's researchers familiar with the Toronto
study were strongly critical of its design and findings. "I
think it's a very poor piece of work; it doesn't prove
anything," said Peter Davies, a researcher at Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York. In particular, the Toronto
group used a test for dementia progression that is unusual.
   The Toronto scientists, led by Don R. C. McLachlan,
emphasized the study of 46 people needs to be replicated.
Moreover, the drug, which was given intravenously, can be
highly toxic. The researchers said subjects reported few
serious side effects, perhaps because the drug was given in
low doses under tight supervision.
   In Summit, N.J., a spokeswoman for Ciba-Geigy Corp., the
U.S. unit of the Basel, Switzerland, drug maker, said the
company plans a larger study at several medical centers. But
the spokeswoman said Ciba-Geigy was concerned lest the
Toronto report trigger demand for Desferal, which the company
produces in only limited amounts.
   Desferal, also known by the generic name deferoxamine
mesylate, is mostly used to treat about 50,000 people
worldwide with an inherited blood disorder, thalassemia,
which results in a potentially lethal overload of iron.
   Autopsies of Alzheimer's patients have shown that their
nerve cells contain about twice as much aluminum as collects
in normal brain cells. The exact nature of the link between
aluminum and the disease isn't understood, nor do scientists
agree whether aluminum is a cause for the disease or
accumulates as a result of some other disease-related
problem.
   In the study, the researchers compared test scores for
memory and a wide range of normal mental activities for
patients given the drug with a group that wasn't treated.
Almost all the subjects showed a decline in functioning over
the three years, but, in aggregate, scores of those receiving
the drug fell at about half the rate of untreated subjects.

<HL> Simple Mouthwash Can Obtain the Cells Used in Gene Tests --- London Research May Ease Screening for Sickle Cell, Other Genetic Diseases </HL>

<TEXT>
   A team of London geneticists reported that a simple mouthwash can obtain cells needed in tests for human genetic defects.

   The mouthwash could replace the taking of blood samples, potentially making mass screening for genetic diseases far simpler and less expensive.

   The researchers, at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School here, used gene-analysis techniques developed three years ago by Cetus Corp., an Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology company.

   The mouthwash method, reported in this week's issue of the Lancet, a leading British medical journal, only requires that people rinse with a simple salt solution to collect loose tissue from the linings of their mouths.

   The St. Mary's team ran the used mouthwash through Cetus's chemical-analysis technique.
In just a few hours, the scientists were able to detect whether the tissue cells contained genetic fragments thought to be associated with cystic fibrosis, a severe inherited disorder of the lungs and digestive system.

   Nicholas Lench, a St. Mary's geneticist who led the researchers, said the mouthwash method might be used to screen for many other genetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia.
Existing gene tests for such disorders normally require expensive, three-day processing of blood samples.

   In an editorial, the Lancet said the mouthwash method "has enormous potential in population screening for single gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis."
It added that the related Cetus chemical-analysis technique, called polymerase chain reaction, "is set to revolutionize" the technology of identifying genes.

   Under the Cetus technique, lab technicians perform a series of relatively simple chemical tricks that make a suspected gene rapidly reproduce and become easily detectable.
The technique avoids the radioactive materials and delicate lab work generally needed to spot genes.

Although the genetic defect that causes sickle cell disease has been known for
more than 30 years, researchers have not been able to develop an effective
therapy for the disease, which strikes one in 400 blacks born in the United
States. When the oxygen content of blood from individuals with the disease
falls below normal levels, as from exercise, red blood cells become deformed
and impair circulation, causing damage to organs.
</P>
<P>
One problem in developing potential therapies is that researchers had never
been able to produce the disease in animals to provide a testing ground.
Molecular biologists from the Universities of Alabama, Pennsylvania and
Washington reported last week in Science, however, that they used genetic
engineering to produce mice with sickle cell disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers inserted the defective human gene for hemoglobin (the
oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells) into mice, where the gene
produced human hemoglobin. These animals were then cross-bred with mice who
normally produce inadequate quantities of mouse hemoglobin.
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the red blood cells in the resultant mice contained the
defective hemoglobin, and these cells sickle when their oxygen content is
reduced. The researchers are studying the long-term effects of such sickling in
the animals.

BLOOD: A STUDY SUGGESTS THAT DONATIONS FROM BLACKS ARE BETTER FOR VICTIMS OF
THE DISEASE. BUT IDENTIFYING DONORS MAY VIOLATE PRIVACY AND STIR RACIAL
PROBLEMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors have become embroiled in a delicate ethical debate after a recent study
suggested that patients with sickle-cell anemia may avoid transfusion
complications if given blood donated by blacks.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether blood banks should ask donors to volunteer information
about their racial backgrounds, making the search for compatible blood easier,
and whether blood banks should routinely provide extensive protein-matching of
donor and recipient blood. Both procedures would decrease the chances of
sickle-cell patients developing transfusion complications, but they would also
require more money and raise serious issues of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the nearly 60,000 people nationwide with sickle-cell disease
-- an inherited blood disorder that affects blacks almost exclusively -- have
received at least one transfusion before the age of 18. Roughly 30% of these
patients, however, develop antibodies against foreign proteins called antigens
in the blood they receive, a condition known as alloimmunization.
</P>
<P>
Once antibodies form, it becomes increasingly difficult -- and sometimes nearly
impossible -- to find compatible blood for subsequent transfusions, increasing
the likelihood that recipients will suffer from transfusion reactions such as
jaundice, severe anemia and kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
The research suggests that genetic differences in certain blood antigens
between whites and blacks may explain, in part, why sickle-cell patients make
antibodies, said Dr. Elliott P. Vichinsky, co-author of a recent study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Children's Hospital in Oakland found that 30% of the 107 black
sickle-cell anemia patients studied who received transfusions developed
antibodies. Moreover, the scientists discovered that 82% of the antibodies
sickle-cell patients produced were against four antigens that commonly occur in
blood donated from whites. In the study, 90% of the blood transfused was
donated by whites.
</P>
<P>
"For sickle-cell patients who have already developed antibodies, knowing which
donors are black could mean a smaller haystack to go looking for the needle
in," said Dr. Samuel Charache, a hematologist at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in Baltimore. In an accompanying editorial, Charache
encourages blood banks and physicians to debate the merits of asking donors to
indicate their race, and keeping the information confidential.
</P>
<P>
Despite suggestions that blacks with sickle-cell anemia may benefit from blood
donors volunteering information about race, the procedure also raises ethical
issues. "Black blood for black people and white blood for white people sounds
like a white water fountain for white people and a colored water fountain for
colored people. It could be twisted into something totally awful," Charache
said.
</P>
<P>
The problem of providing sickle-cell patients with racially matched blood is
compounded by a tremendous lack of black donors. A 1986 American Red Cross
survey found that 95% of all blood donors surveyed were white, while 4% were
black.
</P>
<P>
Some medical experts, while agreeing that knowledge of a donor's race may help
in finding more compatible blood for sickle-cell patients, worry about the
misuse of such information. Dr. Darlene Powers, a pediatric hematologist at the
USC Medical Center, is concerned that, because blacks tend to carry fewer of
the most potent antigens that cause transfusion reactions, it is possible that
blood designated for the benefit of sickle-cell patients might be given to
whites for a variety of reasons, she said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid such controversies, some physicians recommend that blood banks simply
provide antigen-matched (rather than race-specific) blood to sickle-cell
patients even before antibodies develop. But for various reasons, blood banks
argue that such a service would lead to increased costs and unnecessary delays.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven Kleinman of the Los Angeles County American Red Cross said providing
antigen-matched blood is less expensive and better matches can be found if
matching is done only for those who develop antibodies to previous
transfusions. Moreover, transfusing all sickle-cell patients with
antigen-matched blood would probably exhaust the rare blood supply and result
in transfusion delays, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerald Sandler, medical director of the national American Red Cross in
Washington, D.C., remains firm in his stand against altering the Red Cross
blood banking program, which provides half of the nation's blood supply.
</P>
<P>
Sandler remains confident that the Red Cross can continue to meet the needs of
sickle-cell patients through the rare-donor registry program. "We don't have to
invoke race to find a satisfactory solution to the problem."
</P>
<P>
Yet Vichinsky says the crisis for sickle-cell patients "will increase with time
unless there's a shift in transfusion practices."

be presented at a luncheon in New York today.;    Dr. Yuet Wai Kan of the
University of California, San Francisco, won the Lasker award for clinical
medical research.;    In 1975, he discovered that some infants with the
disease alpha-thalassemia lacked a gene for part of the hemoglobin molecule.
It was the first time that a genetic deletion was shown to cause human
disease.;    Later, working with enzymes that cut genetic material into
fragments, he found that the pattern of fragments from patients with sickle
cell anemia differed from the pattern of other people. The discovery led not
only to a genetic test for that disease, but to tests for other genetic
diseases and a method of locating genes.;    The Lasker award for basic
medical research was shared by Edward Lewis of the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena and Christiane Nusslein-Volhard of the Max-Planck
Institute for Developmental Biology in Tubingen, Germany.;    Lewis, while
studying the fruit fly Drosophila, discovered a cluster of genes that controls
how the fly's body segments develop. His work established the idea that
individual genes can control the development of specific regions of the body,
and "launched a new area of investigation into how genes regulate the entire
course of growth of a living organism," the Lasker foundation said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A pigment in red blood cells slows the growth of the AIDS virus in the test
tube and strengthens the action of AZT, the chief drug used against the
disease, researchers have found. The pigment, heme, is what gives blood its
red color.;    Many substances can have strong effects in experiments but no
value in humans. It was not clear when, if ever, heme would be tested in
people.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But, if similar effects are found in tests of heme in people with AIDS, the
use of heme alone or combined with AZT might reduce the amount of AZT needed
to slow AIDS and prevent adverse reactions to the medication, the researchers
reported Thursday in the journal, The Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.;    AZT, or azidothymidine, can produce anemia and bleeding. Many
patients who take it need blood transfusions.;    Heme might help people in
whom AIDS has developed resistance to AZT, said the researchers, from New York
Medical College in Valhalla and Rockefeller University in New York City.;
Heme is the iron-containing pigment in hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein
in red blood cells. Because it is known to play an important role in forming
blood cells from bone marrow, researchers said trials might show that heme has
restorative value among people whose blood systems have been damaged by AIDS.;
   Doctors use heme to treat a rare metabolic disorder, porphyria. But because
heme can be toxic, the researchers are exploring the possibility of using
synthetic and less toxic types of heme, metalloporphyrins, said Dr. Richard D.
Levere, senior author of the report.;    Levere is chairman of the medicine
department at New York Medical College and one of the few scientists in heme
research.;    Some forms of synthetic heme are used experimentally in the
treatment of jaundice of newborns in this country, Levere said. He said his
team will look into the possibility of using a form of heme manufactured in
Finland.;    In the study, researchers isolated the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome from two people with the disease. They then
infected white blood cells with each strain of the AIDS virus. One strain of
the virus was sensitive to AZT; the other had developed resistance to it.
Next, the scientists added either AZT, heme, or both substances to the
infected white blood cells.;    Heme alone substantially slowed the growth of
the drug sensitive strain but did not change the way AZT interferes with the
AIDS virus when given concurrently with the drug.;    Heme alone and AZT alone
failed to slow the growth of the resistant strain of the AIDS virus. Yet a
combination of the two almost completely stopped the strain. The researchers
said they were puzzled about how heme produced its effect on the AIDS virus
and on the action of AZT.  </TEXT>

<HL> Early Tests Show
Protein May Fight
Anemia in AIDS

Research Suggests GM-CSF
Blocks Reproduction
Of HIV Virus as Well

   Scientists reported early tests show a new human protein can successfully treat the problem of anemia in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

   Jerome Groopman, a researcher at the New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, told scientists at a meeting here he treated 16 AIDS patients with the protein, a blood-cell growth factor called GM-CSF.
He said all patients' white blood-cell counts resumed normal levels.

   Side effects included mild aches, chills, and fever.
Phlebitis, an inflammation of the veins, occurred in four patients.

   The protein, naturally produced by the body in small amounts, was synthesized by gene-splicing techniques at Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
It is licensed to Sandoz Inc., the Hanover, N.J., pharmaceutical concern that funded the clinical trial.

   Dr. Groopman's findings, if borne out in further tests, are important because a low white-blood-cell count invites infections that can be fatal to those whose immune systems are weakened by AIDS, cancer chemotherapy or other disorders.

   As previously reported, tests of GM-CSF against cancer began at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, using a version of the protein made by Immunex Corp. of Seattle.

   Anemia is a double-barreled problem for AIDS patients, who often suffer a lowered white count from the syndrome itself.
In addition, a lowered white count is a complication of therapy with Burroughs-Wellcome Co.'s AZT -- the only drug so far approved to treat the fatal disorder.
Burroughs-Wellcome is a unit of Wellcome PLC, Britain.

   Dr. Groopman said the drug may also block reproduction of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

   He said five out of nine patients in the test experienced a drop in viral proteins in their blood after treatment with GM-CSF.
Three patients had no change, and one showed an increase.
However, GM-CSF needs more study before it can be considered an anti-viral drug.

   Dr. Groopman stressed his early results warrant further study in an expanded group of patients with both AIDS and a variety of malignancies, including lung cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma.

   "The question is whether GM-CSF will improve host defenses," Dr. Groopman said.

   Yet to be proven is whether the protein will live up to its performance in the test tube, where it has shown it may prevent infection-fighting cells from migrating from an infection site, and may boost the tumor-fighting capability of killer cells.

   Test results so far, however, were good news for both the company and AIDS patients.

   Despite Dr. Groopman's refusal to preview his results to non-scientists until Saturday's meeting of the American Society of Clinical Investigation, apparent leaks to Wall Street from other sources sparked near-doubling of Genetics Institute's stock price, from the low 20's in January to the low 40's in recent weeks.

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Genetics Institute closed at $41.25, down 12.5 cents.

   Also at the conference, scientists from the National Institutes of Health presented other AIDS drug developments.

   H. Cliff Lane of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said continuing tests of alpha interferon induced tumor shrinkage in some patients with Kaposi's Sarcoma, an AIDS-linked malignancy.
But he noted the drug had no effect when patient's T4 cells, a type of immune sentry ravaged by the disease, had fallen below 100 per cubic millimeter.

   Though manufactured by a number of companies, Alpha interferon for the test was supplied by Schering-Plough.

   In addition, two new members of the AZT family of drugs are advancing through development at the National Cancer Institute.
Dideoxyadenosine, or DDA, and Cyanothymidine, or CNT, like AZT, are false building blocks of DNA that insert themselves into the virus and interrupt its replication.

   Samuel Broder, NCI's chief of clinical oncology, said he hopes to launch human trials of DDA this summer because test-tube studies suggest it is less toxic to the bone marrow than is AZT.

   Saturday's meeting marked the first public mention of CNT, which appears as active as AZT in tissue culture, and thus "should be another candidate for pre-clinical development," Dr. Broder said.

   A presentation about ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s drug ribaviran prompted a renewal of scientific skepticism about the drug, however.
Several scientists suggested the patients receiving a placebo or sugar pill as a control, who should have been carefully selected to match patients in the drug group, were perhaps sicker at the outset.
Thus they developed AIDS much faster, making the drug recipients look good.

   "I wonder how carefully patients were evaluated.
How many placebo patients may have had brewing cases of (pneumonia)?" asked Dr. Groopman.

   Peter N.R. Heseltine, a researcher at the University of Southern California, denied there was any statistical "manipulation," but conceded that differences in patients' T4 cells, a kind of white blood cell that fights infection, did affect the disease's progression.
He maintained the drug "has promise," but needs further study.

<TEXT>
   Researchers announced Thursday that they had discovered and
isolated the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, a landmark finding
that could lead to new treatments for the devastating killer of
young people.
   The discovery should help reveal just what goes wrong in the body
to cause the disease, which in turn may suggest how to treat the
root of the disease rather than just its effects, scientists said.
   The work will also help permit greatly expanded testing to
identify the estimated 12 million Americans who unknowingly carry
the gene in a defective form that causes the disease and who could
pass it along to offspring, said researcher Lap-Chee Tsui.
   These ``carriers'' remain healthy because they carry only a
single copy of a defective form of the newfound gene. The disease
does not appear unless a person inherits two defective copies, one
from each parent.
   Currently, carriers can be identified only if their family has
had a case of cystic fibrosis, and even then not all carriers can be
detected. Knowing the gene should eventually make testing available
to the general population, scientists said.
   Tsui, of the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute in
Toronto, spoke in a telephone interview before participating in a
news conference to announce the finding.
   Tsui, Jack Riordan of the institute and Francis Collis of the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor led the research team, which also included scientists from
the Frederick Cancer Research Facility in Frederick, Md., and the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of
young people in North America. It afflicts about 30,000 Americans,
and 1,000 to 1,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md.
   The disease makes the body produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus
that clogs the lungs and digestive system, interfering with
breathing and digestion.
   Half of patients die before reaching their mid-20s, mostly from
repeated lung infections.
   For cystic fibrosis, the discovery of the gene is ``the most
exciting event since this disease was first described in the medical
literature 50 years ago,'' said Robert Beall, executive vice
president for medical affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation,
which helped support the research.
   It may allow researchers to mimic the disease in cells in the
test tube, allowing them to screen drugs for therapeutic effect, he
said.
   ``It's incredibly important,'' said Nancy Lamontagne, director of
the cystic fibrosis program at the National Institute of Diabetes
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
   It will cause ``an exponential burst of good research'' to
identify the basic problem that causes cystic fibrosis, and then
seek treatments aimed at that problem, she said.
   ``If you know exactly what you're trying to fix ... then you can
approach it with a more specific bullet,' she said.
   Because of the disease's importance, finding the gene is ``the
big prize,'' said Michael Conneally, professor of medical genetics
and neurology at Indiana University Medical Center.
   But Arthur Beaudet of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the
Baylor College of Medicine cautioned that the discovery will not
necesarily lead to effective treatment. The basic defect that causes
sickle cell anemia has long been known, but that has not led to an
effective therapy, he said.
   Genes are segments of a threadlike structures called chromosomes.
The newfound gene is on the chromosome scientists refer to as No. 7.
   One important job of genes is to oversee the body's production of
key proteins. Genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis can occur
when a gene is defective, so that it fails to produce a normal
protein.
   Tsui said the normal role of the newly discovered gene is not
known. But the protein it helps produce appears to be similar
structurally to a family of genes involved in transporting
substances across cell membranes, he said.
   That fits in with the suspicion that cystic fibrosis results from
a defect in a cell's ability to transport electrically charged
particles across cell walls, he said.
   Researchers identified an abnormality in the gene that appears to
be responsible for most cystic fibrosis cases, Tsui said. Other
mutations in the same gene apparently cause the remainder of the
cases, he said.
   The identified abnormality did not appear in chromosomes known to
be normal, he said. In addition, the gene appears to be activated
only in the kinds of cells involved in cystic fibrosis, he said.

   A 4-year-old girl was being prepared to become
the first patient to receive gene therapy in a study that
scientists say could revolutionize he treatment of disease,
officials said Thursday.
   Researchers at the National Institutes of Health said they
expected to be ready to begin the gene-restoration treatment Friday
on the child, who was born with a defective immune system unable to
fight infections and diseases.
   Scientists said they do not expect to see results from the
treatment during the first few months. But if successful, it would
put researchers on a new frontier in medicine that could lead to
similar treatments for cancer, hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, AIDS
and other diseases.
   ``We feel that this is potentially a major new therapy option
that should have significant clinical effects in the next
century,'' said Dr. W. French Anderson, a researcher at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at NIH.
   ``It's very exciting,'' said R. Michael Blaese, an immunology
expert at the National Cancer Institute.
   Because of the potential of the therapy and the importance of
the testing, Anderson said researchers are beginning slowly and
cautiously with their first patient.
   The child, who was not identified, has a rare genetic disease
called ADA deficiency - a defective gene which means her immune
system does not function adequately because the enzyme it produces
is defective. This leaves her vulnerable to infections and diseases
most people can fight off.
   Only about 10 children a year are born with the disease. Without
treatment they die within the first two years of life.
   The best current treatment is a bone marrow transplant with a
donor whose tissue type matches the child's, such as from a brother
or sister. Experts say most children do not have a matched donor.
   For the children without a match, their options are a partially
matched bone marrow transplant, which fails half the time, or
enzyme replacement therapy with a drug called PEG-ADA. Weekly
injections of the new drug decreases the severity of infections for
some patients, but it does not fully restore their immune systems.
   Researchers have already begun the initial work necessary for
the first patient's treatment. Weeks ago, they took white cells
from some of her blood and began growing them in tissue culture.
Then they inserted a normal ADA gene into these cells with a
genetically engineered virus. The virus has been disabled and is no
longer infectious, but serves as a vehicle to get the normal gene
into the cells where it produces the required enzyme.
   Once a sufficient number of ADA-corrected cells have been grown,
they are infused into the patient intravenously.
   In the case of this first patient, scientists expect to give her
about 1 billion cells - about a small thimbleful - mixed in a
saline solution in the first infusion.
   The treatments will be given once a month for about two years.
   The experiment, first proposed by NIH in April 1987, was
recommended for approval by an advisory committee July 31 and was
approved by NIH last week. The Food and Drug Administration gave
its go-ahead Thursday afternoon, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.

<HEAD>Fetal Blood Cells Found in Pregnant Women's Blood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers have isolated fetal cells
from pregnant women's bloodstreams, suggesting it should be
possible to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus simply by taking
a blood sample from the mother.
   If the preliminary finding of fetal cells in mother's
bloodstreams is confirmed, it should be possible to do the same
kind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetal
tissue samples obtained through amniocentesis. That procedure
involves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus.
   Making the diagnosis from a blood sample would eliminate the
small risk associated with amniocentesis, the researchers said.
   The method, however, cannot be used to screen for Down's
syndrome and other disorders in which the chromosomes must be
examined under a microscope, because the fetal cells isolated from
the mother's bloodstream do not allow chromosome diagnosis.
   The method could be useful for diagnosing such disorders as
sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria, in which
the precise genetic defect is known, the study's authors said.
   In those cases, the genetic defect can be detected chemically,
and examination of chromosomes under a microscope is unnecessary.
   Researchers have known that fetal cells could occasionally break
off of the placenta and get into a pregnant woman's bloodstream.
But no one had demonstrated that this occurred often enough so that
fetal cells could be routinely found in the mothers' blood.
   The study, headed by Dr. Diana Bianchi of Boston Children's
Hospital, shows that the fetal cells can be regularly isolated from
mothers' blood, but not 100 percent of the time.
   That accuracy must be improved, and it may be some years before
the method is reliable enough for routine use, Bianchi said in a
telephone interview.
   Furthermore, researchers need better ways to be certain that the
cells they isolate are from the fetus, she said Thursday.
   Bianchi's results will be discussed Saturday at a meeting of
geneticists at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor. She presented
preliminary findings at a meeting in Washington of the Society for
Pediatric Research in May and has submitted more detailed findings
for publication in a medical journal.
   Dr. Laird Jackson of Thomas Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia said that Bianchi's research provides the most
convincing evidence yet that a blood sample from the mother can be
used to diagnose fetal disorders. He noted, however, that the
method is not yet perfected.
   Bianchi and her colleagues, who sampled the blood of four
pregnant women, said looking for the fetal cells was far worse than
looking for a needle in a haystack. The mothers' blood contained
roughly one fetal cell for every billion mothers' cells.
   ``You're really at the limits of technology,'' Bianchi said.
   Fetal cells were extracted by adding an antibody to the blood
sample that would stick to fetal red blood cells but not to adult
red blood cells. The cells with antibodies attached to them could
then be separated with a sophisticated electronic sorting machine.
   But the researchers then had to prove that the cells they had
isolated were indeed fetal cells. Three of the mothers tested were
carrying male fetuses. Males have Y chromosomes and females don't,
so the researchers tried to show that the cells they'd isolated had
Y chromosomes. That would mean that the cells came from the male
fetus, not the mother.
   The researchers were able to prove the existence of the Y
chromosome in two of the three cases in which mothers carried male
fetuses. Bianchi said subsequent tests on more mothers have shown
that the method is reasonably accurate but not perfect.
   The fetal cells that they isolated are called nucleated red
blood cells. Unlike adult red blood cells, these cells have a
nucleus that carries a complete set of the fetus's genes. It is
these genes that can be analyzed for the presence of disorders.

   Michigan Researchers Are Developing
   Method to Place Genes in Body Tissues

   A technique for inserting new genes into specific tissues
in the body is being developed at the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor.
   In experiments on pigs, researchers there inserted a new
gene into cells of a small, limited section of an artery. The
genetically altered cells then began producing a new protein,
the product of the new gene, the Michigan scientists reported
in this week's issue of the journal Science.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The technique holds promise of a new way to treat diseases
such as heart disease and cancer as well as genetic diseases,
said Elizabeth Nabel, Gregory Plautz and Gary Nabel, of the
internal medicine department at the Michigan medical school.
Gary Nabel, who is Elizabeth Nabel's husband, also is with
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute on the Michigan campus.
   A potential beneficiary of the new technique might, for
example, be a heart patient whose clogged coronary arteries
have just been reopened by surgery or other techniques. With
the new technique, a gene that produced a clot-preventing
protein could be introduced into the wall of the newly
reopened section of the artery, thereby preventing a clot
from forming and plugging the artery a second time.
Alternatively, a gene might be inserted that prevented
arterial cells from proliferating into a new, artery-clogging
deposit, the scientists suggested.
   Another possibility, the researchers said, would be to
take a gene that produced a protein that activates the immune
system and insert it into the walls of blood vessels that
supplied a malignant tumor. This way, the immune system might
be triggered to launch a powerful but localized attack on the
tumor.
   The experimental Michigan technique differs from
techniques planned for human gene therapy experiments that
were approved by federal regulators at the end of July. In
the latter experiments, scientists will inject volunteer
patients with blood cells that have been genetically altered
in the test tube. The gene-altered blood cells, it's hoped,
will produce proteins that will cure a devastating genetic
defect in one experiment and a lethal skin cancer in another
experiment.
   In contrast, the Michigan scientists hope to insert new
genes directly into tissues in the body, rather than in
test-tube grown cells, and to confine the genetic alteration
to specific organs or anatomical sites rather than
circulating gene-altered blood cells throughout the body.
   In their pig experiments, the Michigan scientists said
they took a mouse virus long used in medical research and
gave it a new gene that produces a protein called
beta-galactosidase. The protein turns blue when exposed to a
certain chemical, enabling researchers to tell which tissues
were producing the protein and which weren't.
   A thin catheter with two balloons along its tip was
inserted into a thigh artery of each of 10 pigs. The two
balloons, separated by less than an inch of space, were
inflated, blocking the artery fore and aft. The genetically
altered virus was injected into the space between the two
balloons and allowed to infect the nearby walls of the
artery.
   Subsequent tests with the blue-staining chemical showed
that the cells of the artery walls from infected pigs were
producing the beta-galactosidase protein and were still doing
so as long as 21 weeks later. Equally important from a safety
viewpoint, tests of other tissues such as the lungs, liver
and kidneys for the protein were negative, indicating that
the genetic alteration was confined to the short section of
the thigh artery.
   The experiments show that the technique allows "the
introduction of recombinant genes into any site accessible to
a catheter," the researchers said. The technique doesn't
require several weeks of advanced preparation of cells in the
test tube and thus it should help make gene therapy easier
and more widely applicable, the scientists said.

   Gene Defect That Causes Inherited Form
   Of Kidney Failure Is Found by Scientists

   Researchers said they found a gene defect responsible for
an inherited type of kidney failure, an often-fatal problem
requiring dialysis treatments or kidney transplants.
   Researchers at the University of Utah and in Finland said
the inherited defect, called Alport syndrome, is one of the
more common inherited diseases, affecting about one in 5,000
people. It may account for 2,000 of the 100,000 Americans
with kidney failure who must have their blood cleansed
several times a week by expensive dialysis treatments paid
for by a special federal Medicare program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The scientists said they expected the discovery to produce
a genetic test that could detect whether relatives of people
with the disease also inherited the gene defect. Early
detection before kidneys begin to fail might make possible
certain drug therapy that can forestall the damage caused by
the faulty gene.
   Moreover, "knowing the exact gene may help to develop
drugs that can treat kidney failure once it occurs, something
we can't do now," said David Barker, one of the Utah
researchers whose report of the finding is published in
today's Science magazine.
   The gene's discovery is a result of scientists' new
ability to map the location of previously hidden genes, a
technology driving an intense world-wide effort to map the
human genome, the entire collection of genes. The Alport
syndrome gene is located on the X chromosome. Each human cell
contains 23 pairs of chromosomes on which all the genes
reside, one of each pair being inherited from each parent.
   The disease is most common among men because they inherit
just one X chromosome, along with a Y chromosome. Women
inherit two copies of the X chromosome. Thus, defective genes
on one copy of the chromosome are often countered by a normal
copy on the other one.
   Researchers in Utah have been searching for the gene
defect since 1949, when doctors at the university's school of
medicine identified a very large family in which the disease
was being transmitted from generation to generation. In the
1950s, Curtis Atkin, a member of the family with the disease,
joined the university's gene hunt. Under his direction, the
researchers located about 35 affected families in the area
with thousands of members.
   In 1988, Mr. Atkin and colleagues reported that by sifting
through the families' DNA, or genetic material, they found a
marker for the gene on the X chromosome. But they still
didn't have the gene itself, nor did they know how it caused
the kidneys to fail. Then, earlier this year, researchers at
the University of Oulu in Finland found most of a gene that
directs cells to make a kidney collagen, a protein that is
part of the kidney's blood-filtering machinery. The gene, it
turns out, is located at the same spot as the marker found by
the Utah investigators.
   In the report in Science, the researchers said they tested
the DNA from 18 of the families and found that people with
the disease were missing fragments of the collagen gene. The
scientists expect to find the altered gene in the rest of the
families, too. The defect apparently causes the slow
deterioration of kidney tissue.
   "It's our belief that many patients with the inherited
form of this disease aren't being properly identified right
now, and that many of their relatives who are at risk aren't
being treated to prevent the disease's onset," said Martin
Gregory, another member of the Utah team.
   The researchers said they will have the test when they
find the entire collagen gene. Right now, they only have part
of it. Doctors believe they can delay the disease's onset
with so-called ACE inhibitors, drugs used for treating
hypertension.
   The research also was conducted by Mark Skolnick, Steven
Gerken and Arnold Oliphant in Utah, and Karl Tryggvason in
Finland.

<LEADPARA>  Culminating a search that scientists call one of the most important in the
history of medicine, researchers in Palo Alto have isolated the mother cell of
the human blood system. The feat opens the door to curing diseases such as
leukemia, hemophilia and sickle cell anemia. It could also offer a means of
treating AIDS and a more effective way of treating cancer.;   Systemix Inc., a
small Palo Alto-based biotechnology company, announced that its researchers
have purified bone marrow stem cells, the progenitor cells from which the
entire human blood system arises. These cells divide to produce all the basic
types of blood cells -- red cells that carry oxygen; white cells that fight
infection as part of the immune system; and platelets that make blood clot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Stem cells -- whose existence had only been inferred until now -- are
extremely rare in the bone marrow, and scientists believe a single stem cell
may have the ability to rebuild a person's entire immune system. Given that
extraordinary power, the search for the bone marrow stem cell has been called
the Holy Grail of blood research.;   If borne out by scientific data -- the
researchers may present their work next week -- the discovery means physicians
would soon be able to restore a patient's blood and immune systems when
damaged by radiation, chemotherapy or disease.;   Great potential; "This
finding is extremely exciting and important," said Dr. Samuel Broder, National
Cancer Institute director.;   Dr. R. Michael Blaese agreed. "This is
potentially very important for gene therapy for dozens of diseases," said the
NCI immunologist who last year became the first physician to use gene therapy
to treat patients -- two children suffering from a lethal immune system
disease known as adenisine deaminase deficiency.;   The discovery of the stem
cell also promises to be extremely controversial.;    It was not announced in
a scientific journal but by a for-profit company that kept quiet about its
work until it had obtained U.S. patents on the process of isolating the stem
cell and on the cell itself.;   Patenting of life forms -- genes, cells,
tissues, even animals -- is the heart of the burgeoning biotechnology
industry, but the idea still makes many uneasy.;   Ethical questions; By
patenting the bone marrow stem cell, Systemix "introduces us into a new era of
ethical problems in medicine," said Dr. Peter Quesenberry, vice president of
medical and scientific affairs of the Leukemia Society of America. "The idea .
. . you could have commercial restrictions on the use of such cells in
transplants would be very disturbing.";   Systemix plans clinical trials to
test bone marrow stem cell therapy in people early next year. The first
participants will be patients who have otherwise untreatable breast cancer,
leukemia and neuroblastoma, a form of brain cancer.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>New Test Allows Determination of Sex of Fetus from Blood Sample</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sensitive new genetic test has enabled
researchers to determine the sex of 19 fetuses merely by taking
blood from their mothers' arms, says a new report.
   The technique might one day be used to diagnose birth defects
before birth, replacing present methods in which cells must be
obtained from the uterus, researchers said.
   The test, called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, was used
to search for Y chromosomes in the blood of the 19 mothers. Females
do not have Y chromosomes.
   The researchers were hoping that enough fetal cells had leaked
into the mothers' bloodstreams that the Y chromosomes from male
fetuses could be detected.
   They detected the Y chromosomes in seven of the mothers, and
predicted that those women were carrying males. All seven delivered
boys. All of the 12 women in whom Y chromosomes were not found
delivered girls.
   ``With stringent precautions against contamination, this
technique may assist prenatal diagnosis of sex-linked disorders,''
said the researchers, led by Dr. Kenneth Fleming of John Radcliffe
Hospital in Oxford, England. The researchers reported their results
in the Dec. 9 issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
   In May, Dr. Diana Bianchi of Boston Children's Hospital used a
different technique for analyzing mothers' blood samples and
correctly predicted the sex of two out of three male fetuses.
   Other studies had raised the possibility that fetal cells could
be found in mothers' blood, but no one had proven that fetal cells
could be reliably distinguished from the mothers' cells.
   The sex of a fetus can now be determined as early as the eighth
week of pregnancy through a technique called chorionic villus
sampling, or CVS, in which cells from the precursor of the placenta
are removed and tested.
   CVS allows the testing of cells for any of the genetic
abnormalities for which tests exist, including such disorders as
Down's syndrome, Huntington's disease and sickle cell anemia.
   The hope is that mothers' blood can one day be used for the
detection of these other genetic abnormalities, because getting a
blood sample is simpler and safer than CVS or the standard sampling
method, amniocentesis.
   In that procedure, a small amount of the amniotic fluid that
bathes the fetus is withdrawn about the 16th week of pregnancy.
Genetic testing is done on fetal cells that have escaped into the
fluid.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals, Research and Development (4):
Poised for the big switch-off - Scientists are developing ways to control
genes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL research will be transformed over the next two decades
through the development of drugs that act directly on human genes.
Almost all today's drugs act on proteins, the chemicals that do the work in
every living creature from virus to human. But the rapid expansion of
genetic knowledge makes it possible to target the original cause of trouble
 -the genes that determine exactly which proteins the cells make.
Every week the world's molecular biologists announce the discovery of new
genes associated with human disease. They are not only identifying the
molecular causes of classic inherited disorders, such as cystic fibrosis,
but are also finding unexpected evidence for the way particular genes
trigger the most widespread illnesses of modern society, including forms of
cancer and heart disease.
Scientists have already identified several thousand of the estimated 100,000
genes that make up the whole human genetic blueprint and, working through a
loosely co-ordinated international effort known as the Human Genome Project,
they expect to have decoded the entire 'handbook of man' within 10 years.
At the same time, other scientists are rapidly developing ways to manipulate
the newly discovered genes. More than 30 clinical trials have started within
the past two years, mostly in the US. Some involve gene therapy - inserting
new genes into the patient's cells to produce therapeutic proteins in the
body. Others are testing anti-sense therapy or code blocking - the opposite
process of switching off genes so that they stop making harmful proteins.
These genetic drugs can be aimed either at defective genes in the patient's
own cells or at infectious organisms. They promise cures for diseases that
are hard to treat with existing medicines, from rare inherited blood
disorders and cancer to viral infections. And their specificity should avoid
the side-effects of today's protein-based drugs.
Anti-sense therapy is the more difficult to understand of the two
approaches. It uses a short synthetic strand of nucleotides, the chemical
building blocks of DNA and RNA, to switch off genes. Every gene has two
complementary nucleotide strands, which together form the famous double
helix. The nucleotides in one strand are said to have a 'sense' sequence and
the other an 'anti-sense' sequence.
A synthetic anti-sense strand, known as an oligonucleotide, can be used in
two alternative ways. It may bind to the sense strand of the gene's
double-stranded DNA and produce a triple-stranded structure which switches
off the gene. Alternatively, the oligonucleotide binds to the
single-stranded RNA which the gene generates as a first step to producing
protein; this blocks protein synthesis without permanently inactivating the
gene.
Although a whole gene may have several thousand nucleotide units, anti-sense
drugs are much smaller molecules with 15 to 25 units. This is long enough to
make them completely specific. Each will recognise a specific sequence in
the target gene, without binding to any of the 100,000 other human genes.
Pure oligonucleotides are not suitable for pharmaceutical development
because enzymes would break them down before they reached their targets.
Therefore anti-sense drugs are chemical derivatives, such as
methylphosphonates, which are more stable than natural molecules and better
able to enter cells.
US companies specialising in anti-sense technology include Isis, Genta,
Gilead, Hybridon and TargeTech. Isis, based in California, is carrying out
clinical trials of an anti-sense drug to treat human papilloma virus (which
causes genital warts and cervical cancer) and other targets include viral
diseases such as hepatitis B, Aids and herpes, leukaemia and other cancers
and inflammatory disorders. Genetic MediSyn Corporation, based in Maryland,
even hopes to develop an anti-sense drug against baldness, by blocking the
production of an enzyme that is responsible for hair loss.
A serious problem with anti-sense drugs is delivering them to difficult
sites inside the body. Therefore the first generation products are directed
at the skin or at bone marrow cells removed temporarily from the body. But
the anti-sense companies hope to solve the delivery problem by linking their
drugs to other chemicals which enable them to permeate cells more
effectively.
Oligonucleotides may not be the only means of switching off genes, however.
Various small organic molecules are known to bind to DNA, and Proteus, the
UK molecular design company, has formed a partnership with Genelabs
Technologies of California (called Progene Partners) to develop these into
powerful DNA-binding drugs, as an alternative to anti-sense.
Gene therapy is moving forward even faster than gene blocking. Researchers
at the US National Institutes of Health carried out the first human gene
therapy trial in September 1990 on a girl who had to be kept apart from
other children because one defective gene in her immune system meant that
she had no natural protection against infection. Every month since then she
has received a transfusion of about a billion of her own blood cells to
which copies of the correct gene had been added (the treatment has to be
repeated because the genetically-engineered cells gradually die). Her immune
defences are now strong enough for her to go to school normally.
That success had led to a flood of proposals for gene therapy experiments in
the US, where the clinical development of genetic medicine is well ahead of
Europe and Japan. And, as with anti-sense, start-up companies are rushing to
exploit the technology. They include Gene Therapy Inc (GTI), Somatix
Therapy, Viagene, Targeted Genetics, Trans-karyotic Therapies and Vical.
Until recently the established pharmaceutical giants had left gene-based
medicine to academic scientists and biotechnology start-ups.
They are now scrambling to catch up, by starting research in-house and
forming alliances with the specialist biotech companies.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo of the UK, says his company did a
survey of five anti-sense companies, looking for a partnership, 'and came to
the conclusion that Gilead was the best of them. Now we have 35 to 40 people
working on this technology and they have another 35 to 40, with a joint
project group to co-ordinate the work.'
Estimates of future sales of genetic drugs are still highly speculative,
though analysts talk of a market running into tens of billions of dollars
within 20 years.

<HEAD>Scientists Transfer Gene to Fix Inherited Cholesterol Disorder in
Rabbits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers experimenting with laboratory
rabbits have proved that gene manipulation can be used to correct
an inherited disorder that causes high cholesterol levels and early
heart attacks.
   In a study published Thursday in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, researchers reported they were able to
transfer into rabbit liver cells a gene that temporarily corrected
a genetic defect in the liver called familial hypercholesterolimia.
   This disorder is caused by an abnormal gene that prevents the
liver from processing low density lipoprotein cholesterol, the
so-called bad cholesterol. A build up of LDL cholesterol in the
blood leads to clogged arteries, heart attack and stroke.
   A severe form of the disorder, caused by inheriting two abnormal
genes, strikes about one in every 1 million Americans and can lead
to heart attacks as young as age five. A single-gene form of the
disorder strikes about one in every 500 Americans, but produces a
milder disease. About half of the men with the mild disorder die of
heart attack by age 60.
   Dr. James Wilson, assistant professor of internal medicine at
the University of Michigan, said that he and his co-investigators
used Watanabe rabbits, a laboratory animal that inherits familial
hypercholesterolimia, to attempt to correct the disorder through
genetic engineering.
   Wilson said his group removed cells from the liver of affected
rabbits and exposed the cells to a retrovirus that carried a
correct copy of the LDL gene. The virus transferred the gene into
the cells which were then transplanted into other Watanabe rabbits.
   Within three days, said Wilson, the cholesterol levels of the
treated rabbits dropped to near normal.
   ``These rabbits can have levels of up to 700 milligrams per
decaliter of total cholesterol,'' said Wilson. A level of 200 or
more in humans is considered a health problem.
   Wilson said the transferred genes corrected the rabbits'
cholesterol defect for only two weeks. After that, he said, it
appears that the transplanted cells were killed by the rabbit
immune system. When the cells died, so did the transferred genes.
   The next experiment is to remove liver cells from Watanabe
rabbits, insert the missing gene and then return the cells to the
same rabbits. This would avoid the rejection problem, Wilson said.
   ``That technically is more difficult,'' he said. ``It was easier
to test the concept by removing the cells from one rabbit and then
transplanting the cells into another rabbit.''
   Wilson said the technique may eventually be applied to humans
who lack the correct LDL gene, but that it will take years of
laboratory tests in rabbits and perhaps in monkeys and baboons
before clinical trials could be held.
   Working with Wilson on the study were researchers at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York, and the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass.

SCIENTISTS HARNESSING BODY'S NATURAL AGENTS AS POWERFUL HEALERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY THOMPSON, THE WASHINGTON POST
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of the sharp edge of the scalpel or a massive blast of toxic chemicals
to wipe out illness, doctors are turning to the body to heal itself.
</P>
<P>
They are taking the body's natural products -- hormones, antibodies, enzymes
and even whole cells -- to attack disease and restore normal functioning.
Cancer, Parkinson's disease, heart disorders and hormone deficiencies are all
the targets of this new approach to treating illness.
</P>
<P>
Harnessing these new "natural" agents produced by the body might be called
biological therapy, or biotherapy, much as toxic chemicals used to treat cancer
are called chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
It all started with the genetic-engineering revolution in the 1970s when
scientists learned how to manipulate genes in the laboratory. Previously rare
human proteins -- interferon, interleukin-2, human insulin and human-growth
factor -- could suddenly be mass produced with these new gene-engineering
techniques. Although the early experiments in human patients failed to live up
to expectations, solid gains have been made and physicians remain optimistic
about the role of biotherapies.
</P>
<P>
"In the next decade, the major advance will be genetic therapies," said Bruce
A. Chabner, director of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer
treatment. Genetic manipulation, for example, is being increasingly studied as
a way to fight diseases such as cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The idea of biotherapies has been around for decades, though the first ones
were crude. Cow insulin, a protein essential for signaling cells to pull sugar
from the blood, was discovered in the 1920s and injected into the bodies of
diabetics.
</P>
<P>
Vaccination -- the injection of a living but inactive virus or bacteria into
the body -- showed that it was possible to manipulate the body's natural
defenses. The immune system was programmed to prevent subsequent infection by
that particular bacteria or virus.
</P>
<P>
Just before World War II, doctors discovered that blood could be transfused
between individuals. And beginning in the 1960s came the organ transplants --
heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidney, even bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
The common factor between these now standard treatments is that they use
natural substances -- cells in the transfusion, organs in the transplants,
viruses in the vaccines, protein in the insulin. But they are limited. Blood
doesn't always match; organs are rejected; improperly prepared vaccines can
cause the disease they were intended to prevent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the problems came from incomplete understanding of the biology. The new
generation of biotherapies is changing that, putting in doctors' hands some of
the most powerful treatments ever developed. Biotherapies fall, generally, into
three groups: proteins, genes and cells.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, physicians have been putting to use the natural
medicines produced for the first time by the biotechnology labs. Genetic
engineers have learned to put specific human genes into bacteria, turning the
bacteria into miniature factories that grow large quantities of the human
proteins doctors can use against a certain disease. The new protein
biotherapies include:
</P>
<P>
* Clot busters. Several natural proteins have been found that rapidly dissolve
blood clots. Physicians now routinely inject these clot busters to stop heart
attacks in mid-attack -- something that never had been possible. Additionally,
these drugs also have been used experimentally to stop strokes and open painful
blockages in leg arteries.
</P>
<P>
* Blood boosters. A set of proteins has been found that stimulate the bone
marrow to produce both red blood cells and certain types of white blood cells.
Growing red blood cells is revolutionizing the care for end-stage renal
failure, which causes the body to stop making blood. Before this discovery,
these patients needed constant transfusions.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating white blood cells boosts immunity to various types of infections.
It can prevent some of the secondary diseases associated with AIDS. Its most
important use, however, may be the countering of the immune-destroying effects
of cancer chemotherapy, thus allowing physicians to treat tumors with larger
doses of the poisonous drugs and kill the cancer.
</P>
<P>
* Height control. Human-growth factor can literally add inches to children of
short stature. They don't always reach normal height, but they reach heights
previously impossible. Some also have talked about using this powerful hormone
for weight loss, and there have been reports of use by some athletes seeking an
extra edge.
</P>
<P>
* Antibodies. The body's immune system produces thousands of different-shaped
proteins called antibodies that recognize invading bacteria and viruses by
their shape -- and then attack them. Scientists have learned how to make
antibodies of any given type -- called monoclonal antibodies -- that can be
used to diagnose disease both in the lab and in the body and can be used to
attack cancer cells directly.
</P>
<P>
Organ transplants and blood transfusions have led the way in the use of living
cells or tissues to treat an illness. But the new biotherapies take it all a
quantum leap further.
</P>
<P>
* Brain transplants. Clearly the brain itself cannot be transplanted, but parts
of the brain wear out for uncertain reasons. Parkinson's disease arises with
the loss of certain brains cells that produce a chemical needed for normal
movement. Neurosurgeons have now experimented with transplanting into the brain
patches of human cells that produce the missing chemical. Preliminary
experiments with nerve cells taken from aborted fetuses reportedly show
promise.
</P>
<P>
* Tissue transplants. In diabetes, pancreatic cells stop secreting the protein
insulin. Although insulin can be injected every day, control of blood sugar is
better when a pancreas is transplanted into the body. A number of human
experiments are under way to inject just the insulin-making cells in the hope
that they will work better and be easier to protect from rejection.
</P>
<P>
* Killing cancer. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute have found that
certain white blood cells are primed to attack cancers. They remove those cells
and stimulate them in the lab with a growth factor called interleukin-2. Once
several billion of the white blood cells have grown in the lab, they are put
back into the patient's body and attack the tumor. More than half of the
patients with the skin cancer malignant melanoma and with kidney cancer now
respond to this treatment.
</P>
<P>
The third general form of biotherapy, genetic, relies on the recent ability to
insert genes into cells of the body. Genes control the production of proteins,
so gene transfers can be used to replace a missing protein permanently. This is
the future of medicine, many believe. About 4,000 inherited diseases could be
attacked by this technology.
</P>
<P>
* First steps. In the first gene transfer experiments in humans, begun last
year at the National Institutes of Health, cancer researchers put a bacterial
gene into the white blood cells they already had been turning into cancer
killers. The gene allows them to track the altered blood cells in the body and
to see which type best kills the cancer. Future experiments in which other
genes are added should boost the cell's cancer-killing power.
</P>
<P>
* Artificial organs. The biggest problem with gene therapy is getting the
altered cells back into the body so that they survive. One approach under
development in animals creates an artificial organ by growing the gene-modified
cells on a synthetic pad that is surgically placed in the animal's abdomen.
Hormones are added that make blood vessels grow into the pad. Theoretically,
the newly created organ could be designed to secrete any protein to treat a
wide array of illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Although the new biotherapies have begun to radically alter the treatment of
disease, they also have created controversies. For example, some of the tissue
transplanted for diabetes and Parkinson's comes from aborted fetuses. Groups
opposed to abortion have so strongly opposed the use of this material that the
government no longer funds any related research.
</P>
<P>
The debate will grow more intense as the massive project to identify and
analyze every single human gene, now being developed at NIH, gets under way. It
will speed the ability to detect diseases for which nothing can be done. That
means doctors will be able to tell which patients are likely to get which
diseases. Will patients want to know?

<HL> Scientists Are Hunting a Vital Blood Cell --- Search for the Stem Cell Advances at Stanford </HL>

   Scientists are hot on the track of what is unquestionably the most important -- and most mysterious -- blood cell in the human body.

   Known as a stem cell, it is the grandmother of all the body's blood cells -- from the oxygen-carrying red cells to the armies of infection-fighting white cells.
Produced somewhere deep in the bone marrow, stem cells migrate to other parts of the body's blood-forming tissues, such as the spleen or thymus gland.
Depending on where they land, the stem cells then produce progeny that become either red blood cells or any of a variety of white blood cells.

   For more than 35 years, scientists have been trying to identify the stem cells among the body's tens of millions of blood cells.
Finding them would open new and more powerful methods of treating cancer, radiation sickness, immune disorders and other illness.
Pure stem cells might also be the vehicles for inserting new genes into victims of various genetic diseases, researchers say.

   A major step toward finding human stem cells has been taken by scientists at Stanford University medical school, near San Francisco, according to a recent report in the weekly magazine, Science.

   The Stanford researchers successfully used a new technique to isolate stem cells of mice.
The cells were then implanted into mice whose blood-forming bone marrow had been completely destroyed by lethal doses of radiation.
Following injections of as few as 30 stem cells, half the mice survived and formed a new blood system complete with all varieties of blood cells.

   Other research groups had previously isolated mouse stem cells, notes Malcolm A.S. Moore, an experimental hematologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
The Stanford researchers, however, "kind of put the icing on the cake" by showing that a mouse's blood system could be completely reconstituted by implanting just a few stem cells, Dr. Moore says.
"They showed that the stem cells actually work when put back into the whole animal," he says.

   The Stanford scientists are now teaming up with bone-marrow specialists at the university's medical school to use their mouse experience to track down human stem cells, says Irving L. Weissman of the school's Laboratory for Experimental Oncology.
Dr. Weissman and two colleagues, Gerald J. Spangrude and Shelly Heimfeld, carried out the mouse experiments.

   Cancer patients likely would be among the first to benefit from discovery of human stem cells, say Drs.
Weissman and Moore.
At present, the use of drugs and radiation to treat cancer is limited by the damage these treatments cause to the bone marrow.
If human stem cells were available, it would be possible to give a cancer patient far higher doses of radiation or chemicals, enough to ensure complete destruction of the cancer cells.
The patient's destroyed bone marrow and blood system could then be reconstituted by injections of a few of the patient's own stem cells that had been extracted earlier and stored.

   Transplants of bone marrow from donors also could be made safer for cancer patients as well as for children who suffer immunological defects and other blood-system disorders.
Although bone-marrow transplants from one person to another are occasionally done today, they are risky.
As much as a pint of bone marrow from a donor has to be transplanted to a recipient.
Because the donor's bone marrow consists of a complete spectrum of all the blood cells, the marrow tries to "reject" the recipient's body as "foreign" tissue.

   This "graft-vs.-host" reaction is a major complication of bone-marrow transplants and limits their use to specialized teams in major medical centers.
Such a reaction would be avoided, however, if only the donor's stem cells were transplanted.
The stem cells wouldn't attack the recipient's tissues but, instead, would migrate to various parts of the recipient's body and churn out a complete line of progeny blood cells that would be compatible with the recipient's body.
Thus, stem cells could make transplants of donor bone marrow widely available.

   Victims of radiation accidents like the Chernobyl reactor disaster also could be aided, Dr. Moore explains.
There have been suggestions that it might be prudent for atomic energy workers to have some of their own bone marrow extracted and stored in case they are accidently exposed to lethal doses of radiation.
But storing a pint of bone marrow for each of tens of thousands of workers poses an impossible logistics problem, he explains.
"If you could isolate stem cells, you would only have to store less than a quarter of a teaspoon of each person's stem cells" to have enough to reconstitute his blood system should it be destroyed in a radiation accident, he explains.

   Identifying stem cells isn't easy, however.
At least nine or 10 major types of blood cells circulate in the body.
Besides the easily identified, plate-shaped red blood cell there are a variety of white blood cells, or lymphocytes, many of which look identical under the microscope.
They perform different jobs, however.
Some produce antibodies that engulf viruses, others attack cancer cells or foreign tissues and still others regulate the immune system, alternately suppressing or enhancing its battle against disease.

   As early as 1956, animal experiments hinted that all these blood cells may be descendants of the same small population of stem cells.
Each stem cell had the potential of producing any of the different blood cells, the theory went.
If a stem cell migrated from the bone marrow to the spleen, it would soon churn out progenitors of red blood cells.
If it went to the thymus gland, it would churn out progenitors of any of several so-called T (for thymus) lymphocytes, whereas if it migrated to another region of the bone marrow, it would produce B (for bone marrow) lymphocytes.

   To find the mouse stem cells the Stanford researchers used a process of elimination.
Researchers in Toronto and in West Germany had found that many of the fully developed blood cells, such as the B and T lymphocytes, carry distinctive proteins on their surfaces.
These proteins can be spotted by so-called monoclonal antibodies, laboratory-made versions of the antibodies the body produces to fight off viruses and other "foreign" invaders.

   Using the Toronto and German discoveries, the Stanford researchers took a population of mouse bone-marrow cells and pulled out all the fully developed T and B lymphocytes.
The scientists then sifted through the remaining cells with a monoclonal antibody that the German researchers had discovered and which, they believed, would home in on mouse stem cells.
They eliminated all cells that failed to react to this antibody.
That left them with a tiny population of bone-marrow cells that clearly weren't fully developed blood cells.

   Proof that these residual cells were true stem cells came when they were injected into mice whose bone marrow had been destroyed by radiation.
The mice in a matter of weeks developed a complete panoply of fully developed blood cells, most of which were clearly descended from the injected stem cells.

   Although mice aren't humans, the same tactics might be adapted to tracking down human stem cells, Dr. Weissman says.
"The mouse model tells us we're going in the right direction," adds Dr. Moore in New York.

   The main problem to overcome, Dr. Weissman says, is that the mouse experiments involved the use of whole animals.
"Obviously, it would be unethical to do the same with humans," he says.
"Perhaps we can develop a whole-animal experimental model for the human, for example, with baboons," he adds.

   Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle already have begun experiments with reconstituting blood systems in baboons given lethal doses of radiation, according to a report in Science.

<TEXT>
   The Epstein-Barr virus that causes
mononucleosis also may trigger a rare form of anemia that can lead
to death, scientists reported Tuesday.
   The DNA, or genetic code, of the Epstein-Barr virus has been
found in the bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia,
researchers report in this week's Philadelphia-based Annals of
Internal Medicine.
   In patients with that disease, usually young adults, the bone
marrow quits functioning and fails to produce enough red blood cells
to carry oxygen through the body.
   While unlikely to be a common cause of bone marrow failure among
those who lack a history of infectious mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr
virus, or EBV, must be considered as a possible cause of aplastic
anemia, the authors wrote.
   According to the lead researcher, Dr. Bruce Baranski, a
hematologist at the University Wisconsin at Madison, aplastic anemia
afflicts about 200 people a year in this country, usually a few
months after a bout of mononucleosis.
   Treatment requires drugs, and not all patients survive.
   The authors said the research suggests three possible mechanisms
for how Epstein-Barr infects the bone marrow:
   _The virus could directly attack and kill bone marrow cells.
   _It could cause the immune system to turn against the bone
marrow, shutting down the production of blood cells.
   _Other viruses may aid Epstein-Barr in causing the anemia, as
occurs in patients with AIDS, a disease involving a compromised
immune system.
   James Jones, a pediatric immunologist at the National Jewish
Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in Denver, said the
new research ``takes you one step closer'' to understanding the
causes of aplastic anemia.
   He said the research eventually could lead to a form of therapy
directed toward the virus or a treatment aimed at suppressing an
immune system that has turned against itself. ``It could be that
aplastic anemia is secondary to an overzealous immunosuppressive
system,'' he said.
   The researchers began their study in late 1985 after treating a
patient who had severe aplastic anemia following a bout of
mononucleosis. Based on prior research, they suspected Epstein-Barr
might play a role in the anemia and found traces of the virus's DNA
only in the patient's bone marrow.
   According to Yale epidemiologist James Niederman, who discovered
that Epstein-Barr causes mononucleosis in 1968, almost all adults
have been infected with it at some time.
   Niederman said the report published Tuesday confirmed
researchers' suspicions that Epstein-Barr might play a role in
triggering aplastic anemia.
   Researchers also have linked Epstein-Barr to chronic fatigue
syndrome, the so-called ``yuppie flu,'' but the association between
the virus and the syndrome remains unclear.
   Baranski said the researchers studied five patients treated for
aplastic anemia at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center
and one at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   All had traces of the virus in their bone marrow and several had
experienced mononucleosis, he said.
   The researchers also reviewed the cases of 40 prior patients with
aplastic anemia and other blood diseases and found traces of the
virus, Baranski said.

   Protein May Limit Damage
   In Heart Attacks, Arthritis

   Scientists armed with a new genetically engineered protein
believe they have found a new way to manipulate the human
immune system to treat heart attacks and a range of
inflammatory diseases.
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University medical school in
Baltimore and T Cell Sciences Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.,
reported that they used the new protein in rats to limit the
damage from heart attacks, and suggested that the protein
could do the same in humans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The research, which is being funded by SmithKline Beecham
PLC, also could lead to new therapies for arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases, the scientists suggested in their
report in this week's issue of Science. The report is an
elaboration of experiments briefly described by the
researchers last fall at the annual meeting of the American
Heart Association.
   The research involves a new way to block the action of a
part of the immune system known as the "complement system."
This is a collection of proteins that are activated when the
body is invaded by bacteria, fungi, viruses or other foreign
substances. Among other actions, the complement proteins
activate certain special blood cells to rush to an injured
area to clean up the debris left after the assault on, say, a
bacterium.
   One adverse side effect of activating these specialized
blood cells is that the cells can inadvertently trigger an
inflammation of normal tissues. This is believed to be the
cause of some inflammatory diseases such as certain types of
arthritis, and of disorders involving inflammation of the
blood vessels (vasculitis), the kidneys (glomerulonephritis)
and muscles (myasenthia gravis).
   Douglas T. Fearon and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins
reported that they had pinpointed one of the complement
proteins that can be used to block the complement system --
preventing, they hope, or at least damping the damaging
inflammatory response. The blocking protein engineered by T
Cell Sciences is a shortened version of a natural human
protein called complement receptor one (CR1).
   In its first animal test, the engineered CR1 protein
successfully limited the damage of a heart attack in rats. In
this test, Dr. Fearon teamed up with Myron R. Weisfeldt and
his colleagues at Johns Hopkins who have been exploring a
phenomenon called "reperfusion injury."
   In a heart attack, the initial damage to the heart muscle
is caused by a sudden blockage of blood flow by a blood clot.
Dr. Weisfeldt and others believe that additional damage to
the heart muscle occurs when blood flow is restored, as
happens when the new clot-dissolving drugs are used to get
rid of the blocking clot. This additional damage --
reperfusion injury -- is thought to be caused by
complement-activated blood cells that rush into the damaged
area with the restored flow.
   In the rat experiment, blood flow to part of the heart
muscle was temporarily stopped to simulate a heart attack and
then restored. In the animals treated with the engineered
CR1, the area of damage in the heart muscle was more than 30%
smaller than in animals that had "heart attacks" but weren't
treated with the protein, the researchers reported.
   In a second experiment, far fewer complement-activated
cells were found in the damaged area of the hearts of
CR1-treated rats than in untreated rats, indicating the
protein was, indeed, limiting heart damage by blocking the
complement system.
   At T Cell Sciences, Scientific Director Patrick Kung said
the company had licensed rights to the proteins from Johns
Hopkins and from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,
where Dr. Fearon began his research. Mr. Kung said the
biotechnology company hopes to begin trials of the CR1
protein in human heart-attack patients late next year.
   SmithKline Beecham, the big Anglo-American drug company,
is providing $10 million to $12 million to T Cell Sciences
for the preclinical studies of the complement-blocking
proteins and will fund human testing of the protein in return
for world-wide marketing rights.

Diagnostic Tests:
Demystifying the Results
---
By Jerry E. Bishop</HL>

<IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN>
<TEXT>
   IN TRYING to diagnose a patient's illness, doctors will run a variety of tests.
The results, however, remain a mystery to most patients.
Here's a guide to the most common tests.

   Blood Pressure
   High blood pressure, known medically as hypertension, increases the risk of stroke and heart attack.
It also can lead, in the long run, to eye damage and to kidney damage and failure.

   The pressure with which the heart pushes blood through the arteries is measured at two moments during the heartbeat cycle.
The larger number in a blood pressure reading is the pressure at the time the heart contracts (the systolic pressure); the smaller number is the pressure at the moment the heart relaxes (the diastolic pressure).
Because blood pressure can vary, a doctor will measure it on at least three different days before making a diagnosis of hypertension.

   For an adult, the highest pressure considered normal is 140/90, although in those over age 60, a slightly higher pressure may be considered acceptable.
Pressures as high as 180/115 are termed mild to moderate hypertension, and higher pressures are deemed severe hypertension.

   Cholesterol
   Cholesterol is a fatty alcohol produced by the liver that circulates in the serum, the watery fraction of the blood.
High levels of circulating cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerosis, the clogging of the heart's arteries with fatty deposits.
A buildup of such deposits can lead to a heart attack.

   Doctors are abandoning the concepts of normal and abnormal serum cholesterol levels in favor of "risk categories," levels at which the risk of a heart attack is average, moderate or high.
The risk categories, by age, in milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of serum, are as follows:


                  AVERAGE         MODERATE         HIGH
     AGE           RISK             RISK           RISK
    20-29        below 200         201-220      above 220
    30-39        below 220         221-240      above 240
    40 plus      below 240         241-260      above 260
   Triglycerides
   Triglycerides are the fats circulating in the blood
stream, originating from either the diet or the body's fat
stores.
   The link between a high level of circulating triglycerides
and atherosclerosis isn't as strong as the link between
cholesterol and atherosclerosis. But many heart specialists
are recommending that triglyceride levels be measured and the
patient treated with diet or drugs if the levels are
abnormal.
   Triglyceride levels tend to rise with age and to be higher
in women than in men. A level of 200 milligrams or less per
deciliter of blood is considered normal. Levels above 250 are
thought to carry an increased risk of an eventual heart
attack.
   A combined cholesterol and triglyceride measure also can
help the doctor calculate levels of the forms of cholesterol
called HDL and LDL cholesterol.
   LDL/HDL Cholesterol
   LDL/HDL cholesterol is the measure of the two major types
of cholesterol circulating in the serum.
   LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is the more dangerous form
and should be as low as possible. HDL (high-density
lipoprotein) is the "good" form of cholesterol and should be
as high as possible. HDL is the form in which cholesterol is
pulled out of tissues and taken to the liver for disposal.
   Although normal or desirable levels haven't been formally
agreed upon, an LDL level above 150 to 170 milligrams per
deciliter of serum is considered by many heart specialists to
be higher than desirable. An HDL level below 40 or 45
milligrams per deciliter is felt by many to be less than
desirable.
   Hematocrit
   This test measures the percentage of red cells in the
blood. It can be performed on a single drop of blood from a
finger prick.
   A normal hematocrit is 42% to 52% for adult men, 37% to
47% for adult women and 31% to 42% for children. A low
hematocrit suggests anemia but doesn't indicate the cause of
the anemia.
   Red Blood Cell Count
   Adult men normally have 4.7 million to 6.3 million red
cells in a cubic millimeter of blood, and adult women
normally have 4.2 million to 5.4 million. Children may have
slightly lower counts. A low red blood cell count is termed
anemia and may indicate iron or vitamin deficiency, drug side
effects, internal bleeding, chronic illness or organ damage.
A high red blood cell count may indicate heart problems.
   Hemoglobin
   Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen in the blood
and gives red blood cells their color. A normal hemoglobin
level is 14 to 18 grams per deciliter of blood for an adult
male, 12 to 16 grams for an adult female and 10 to 15 grams
for a child. A low hemoglobin level is another indication of
anemia.
   White Blood Cell Count
   Adults and children over the age of two normally have
5,000 to 10,000 white cells in a cubic millimeter of blood. A
higher-than-normal count indicates that the body is trying to
fight off infection.
   White Blood Cell Differential
   This test determines what percentage of the total white
blood cell count is composed of each of the five types of
white blood cells.
   Knowing which type of white blood cell is present in
higher-than-normal numbers helps a doctor determine what type
of infection the patient has; a high lymphocyte count, for
instance, indicates a viral infection, while a high
neutrophil count suggests a bacterial infection.
   Blood Glucose
   Glucose is the sugar the body forms from dietary starches
and other carbohydrates. Normal levels, measured after
overnight fasting, range between 70 and 110 milligrams per
deciliter of blood.
   Higher levels might indicate diabetes, and lower levels
suggest hypoglycemia, which can cause irritability and
emotional distress.
   Blood Urea Nitrogen
   Blood urea nitrogen is a measure of the breakdown of
proteins by the liver. The breakdown products are filtered
out of the blood by the kidney and excreted in urine.
   Normal levels of urea nitrogen range from five to 20
milligrams per deciliter of blood. A high level may indicate
kidney problems or dehydration caused by vomiting or
diarrhea. It may also indicate liver problems.
   Urinalysis
   Normal urine should be clear with a pale yellow to amber
color. Its pH number, a measure of acidity, should be 4.6 to
8, with an average of 6. Its specific gravity, a measure of
the water and particle levels, is normally 1.005 to 1.030.
Its concentration of the protein albumin is normally less
than eight milligrams per deciliter. And there are rarely
more than two or three blood cells.
   Variations from these norms or the presence of various
body chemicals in the urine can be indications of a variety
of disorders. A dark red color can result from bleeding in
the kidney.
   Prothrombin Time
   Prothrombin time is a measure of how quickly the blood
clots in a test tube, normally 10.5 to 12.5 seconds. The
result sometimes is given as a percentage of normal clotting
time.
   A longer-than-normal prothrombin time can indicate that
additional tests are needed for possible liver disease, bile
duct obstruction, inherited blood disorders or other
problems. Certain medications also can prolong prothrombin
time.
   Sedimentation Rate
   Sedimentation rate doesn't test for any specific disease
but tells the doctor the body is having some kind of problem,
perhaps an inflammatory disease such as arthritis, an
infection or a malignancy.
   The test simply involves seeing how quickly the red blood
cells settle through a column of water. For men, this is
normally no higher than about 15 millimeters an hour. Women's
red cells settle slightly more rapidly, at as much as 20
millimeters an hour. Higher rates indicate the red cells are
heavier than normal, possibly as the result of some disease.

<HL> New Enzyme-Replacement Technique
Shows Promise Against Genetic Disease

   A new approach for treating certain genetic diseases by enzyme replacement produced promising initial results in two children born with severely disabled immune systems.

   The children lacked a gene that produces a vital enzyme.
The new but still unproved therapy involved giving the children weekly injections of the missing enzyme.
The key to the therapy was to modify the injected enzyme so it would remain active in the body for several days and wouldn't produce allergic reactions.

   The technique for modifying the enzyme was developed by Enzon Inc., a small biotechnology company in South Plainfield, N.J.

   The two children, one age four and the other age 10, had suffered chronic illness and slow growth since birth because their defective immune systems were unable to fight off infections.
Following several months of the new enzyme-replacement therapy, laboratory tests indicated the children's immune systems were newly active.
The older child recovered fully from a bout of pneumonia while the younger one gained weight and height.

   Whether the new form of treatment will continue to work isn't yet known, researchers from Duke University, the University of Nebraska and Enzon cautioned in a report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
But they added, "We believe that prospects for effective treatment by enzyme replacement must be viewed with greater optimism than in the past."

   The two children were born without the gene that produces an enzyme called adenosine deaminase, or ADA, and thus were unable to convert two body chemicals to usable substances.
As a result, the two chemicals accumulated in the tissues and caused a buildup of toxic substances that crippled the infection-fighting white blood cells.

   Such ADA deficiency has been cured in several children who are fortunate enough to have a brother, sister or parent whose bone marrow is compatible and can be transplanted to provide a permanent source of normal, ADA-producing blood cells.
A bone-marrow transplant failed in the younger child and wasn't attempted in the older child.

   Injections of ADA would overcome the deficiency, except that ADA circulating in the blood would be broken down by the body within a few hours.
Moreover, the body would form antibodies against "foreign" ADA, which normally is derived from cow blood, rendering it ineffective and potentially allergenic.

   To prevent these reactions, Enzon developed a method of coating enzymes with a synthesized organic compound called polyethylene glycol (PEG).
The two children were the first humans to receive such a PEG-modified enzyme following animal tests indicating it was safe.
Tests of the children showed that the PEG-ADA was rapidly absorbed and was active in the bloodstream for several days.
Laboratory tests indicated the PEG-ADA was clearing out the accumulated toxic chemicals and that their immune systems were improving.

   In an accompanying editorial, Rochelle Hirschhorn, an expert in genetic diseases at New York University Medical Center, cautioned that such short-term improvements aren't always predictive of long-term effectiveness of treatments for genetic disorders, and she urged caution.
Nevertheless, she added, the idea of PEG-modified enzymes is "potentially exciting" and might be useful in several other genetic disorders involving missing enzymes.

   Studies of the brain of a young suicide who carried the
gene for Huntington's disease are providing a glimmer of hope
that treatments can be developed for the deadly brain
disorder.
   Based on the discovery and some previous findings,
researchers are beginning to test several prototype drugs on
patients with the disease. Doctors caution that the tests are
in preliminary stages and that they are uncertain about the
drugs' effects.

   Still, "the new research suggests a (treatment) strategy,
and that's very important," said Susan Folstein, a
Huntington's disease researcher at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
   Huntington's is an inherited disease, often called a
genetic time-bomb because its symptoms -- a degeneration of
physical and mental control -- don't explode until a person
is nearing middle age. The disease, invariably fatal, affects
only about 25,000 Americans, but another 125,000 are thought
to carry the gene that causes it. Everyone who inherits the
gene is destined to develop the disease.
   While scientists know the disease is caused by a single
defective gene passed from parent to child, they have yet to
find the gene. And they don't yet know how it wreaks havoc on
the body. But in a report published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, researchers at the University of
Michigan said they have traced a trail of destruction to
certain nerve cells in the brain of a young woman who carried
the gene but had yet to develop symptoms.
   "The study is a capstone for a series of recent studies
suggesting a pathway through which the gene damages the
brain," said Roger Albin, a neurologist at the University of
Michigan. "It's a provocative finding."
   For several years, Dr. Albin and his colleagues, and
researchers elsewhere, have been studying the brains of
people who died from Huntington's disease. The scientists
found that nerve cells related to a chemical called
enkephalin, which transmits messages among brain cells, are
destroyed. But they weren't certain if nerve cell destruction
was the cause or just one of the effects of the disease.
   To solve the riddle, scientists needed to analyze the
brain of someone who carried the gene but hadn't yet
developed the disease and thus might provide a clue about
whether the nerve damage was occurring before the disease.
But until the early 1980s, scientists had no way of knowing
who carried the gene and who didn't. Then in 1983 scientists
used new DNA technology to pinpoint a genetic "marker" that
was physically close to the Huntington's disease gene. A test
that detects the marker can determine whether a person has
inherited Huntington's disease.
   The test has become controversial because it can predict
who will develop the disease yet there is no treatment to
offer people who learn of their fate. Thus, researchers are
under great pressure to find some type of therapy for the
disease.
   The Michigan researchers were sent the brain of a 31-year
old woman who had suffered bouts of severe depression, willed
her brain to research and subsequently committed suicide.
When the scientists examined the brain, they were startled to
see early signs of the kind of cell damage usually seen in
older Huntington's disease victims. Tracing back, they found
that the woman had relatives with Huntington's disease.
   The woman had also had a specimen of her blood stored
before she died. Using the new gene detection test, the
Michigan researchers found evidence in the blood that the
woman had carried the Huntington's disease gene and,
therefore, had been destined eventually to develop the
disease.
   The scientists found that the woman's brain was missing
normal amounts of a "receptor" on nerve cells that receives
certain chemical messages. The receptor, called NMDA, is also
thought to be the target of toxic proteins released by the
brain following a stroke or other trauma. Dr. Folstein at
Johns Hopkins said the Michigan report and other research
strongly suggest that an NMDA-protecting drug could prevent
the nerve damage associated with the disease. Several drug
research teams, including one at Merck &amp; Co., are testing
drugs that can protect the NMDA receptor from the destructive
proteins.
   Dr. Folstein said she and others are now testing
experimental drugs that appear to block the toxic proteins.
"The trick is to develop drugs that selectively affect only
those NMDA receptors involved in Huntington's disease, and
not the other receptors located throughout the brain," Dr.
Folstein said. Scientists racing to find the Huntington's
disease gene hope that it will provide the final clue,
helping to identify the specific NMDA receptors.

GENETIC ENGINEERING ACHIEVES 'MAJOR STEP' TOWARD HEMOPHILIA CURE

Implants of genetically engineered skin cells in dogs with hemophilia B, a rare
bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, can bring the
symptoms under control for short periods, according to researchers from the
Salk Institute in La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers have many technical obstacles to overcome before the
new approach can produce a cure in the animals, their research, reported Monday
in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, represents
a bold new approach to this genetic disorder, which is now treated with an
expensive protein isolated from concentrated blood plasma.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step forward toward a cure for hemophilia," said hematologist
Frederick Rickles of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. "I think
it's just terribly exciting."
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia afflicts as many as 20,000 males in the United States. Women can
carry the gene for the disorder, but generally do not develop it.
</P>
<P>
It is caused by a defective gene that would normally serve as a blueprint for a
protein that plays a crucial role in the clotting process that prevents people
from bleeding to death after being cut or wounded. It exists in two main forms,
called A and B.
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia A, the more common form and the type which is associated with
European royalty, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor VIII.
Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease after the surname of the first
two people diagnosed with it, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor
IX.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only treatment for either type is injections of either Factor
VIII or Factor IX isolated from the blood of healthy individuals. Because the
proteins are present in blood in only very small quantities, large volumes of
blood must be pooled for the isolation procedure, greatly increasing the risk
that the material will be contaminated with the viruses that cause hepatitis or
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90% to 95% of the nation's 7,000 to 9,000 hemophiliacs with the
most severe cases of the disease are thought to be infected with the AIDS
virus. Among moderate hemophiliacs, who require fewer injections, the infection
rate is thought to be 40% to 50%.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have developed techniques to cleanse blood products of viruses, but
the isolated protein is very expensive. A year's treatment may cost as much as
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to collecting Factor VIII from blood, researchers have
produced it in the laboratory using genetic engineering techniques. This
product has been successfully tested in humans, but the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has not approved it for marketing. Genetically engineered Factor
IX has not yet been tested in humans.
</P>
<P>
The new research reported Monday opens the door to a technique by which
hemophiliacs would produce the protein in their own body.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted using dogs that suffer from hemophilia B. They are
maintained in a unique colony at the University of North Carolina in Chapel
Hill by pathologists Marjorie S. Read and Kenneth M. Brinkhous. Called keagles,
the animals arose from a cross between a cairn terrier and a beagle, and the
colony has been maintained for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Salk Institute molecular biologists Jonathan H. Axelrod and Inder M. Verma took
skin cells from keagles and used a specially designed virus to introduce a
healthy gene for Factor IX into them. Their paper reports that the cells
produce and secrete Factor IX.
</P>
<P>
Axelrod and Verma have constructed mini-organs with the engineered cells and
implanted them under the skin of the keagles. The implant produces Factor IX
for at least a few weeks, and the animals' blood will clot normally, Axelrod
said. But the clotting time gets longer and longer, indicating failure of the
implant.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, "we can't pinpoint a specific problem." It may be that the
cells are dying or that they stop producing Factor IX. The researchers are
trying to isolate and correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not discouraged by that," said Rickles, vice president of medical affairs
for the National Hemophilia Foundation. "While it may take some time, we are on
the right track."

   At 12:52 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, doctors at
the National Institutes of Health began transfusing white blood
cells into the tiny arm of a 4-year-old girl with a rare inherited
ailment.
   For 28 minutes she played with her doctors and put stickers on
their lab coats as she helped them launch a new era in medical
treatment.
   She became the first person to receive gene therapy, a treatment
intended to compensate for the genetic defect she was born with by
giving her normal copies of the defective genes.
   News of the experiment had special interest for Suzanne
Tomlinson, a 27-year-old woman from Alexandria, Va.
   ``The idea of gene therapy was always sort of far off and maybe
a little idealistic,'' she said. ``It has been in the back of my
mind that, theoretically, gene therapy would be the key that would
really cure the disease.''
   The disease is cystic fibrosis. She was diagnosed with it when
she was 7 months old.
   The 4-year-old gene therapy pioneer, whose name has been
withheld, has a rare immune system disorder. But gene therapy holds
promise for people with many inherited diseases, including cystic
fibrosis.
   Indeed, recent discoveries about cystic fibrosis have made it
one of the leading candidates for gene therapy, perhaps within the
next five years, said Robert Beall, executive vice president for
medical affairs at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md.
   ``What we thought to be decades away is now years away,'' said
Beall.
   Other potential candidates for gene therapy within the next few
years are certain forms of anemia, hemophilia and muscular
dystrophy.
   It will be at least several months before researchers know
whether gene therapy is succeeding in the 4-year-old girl. Many
researchers, poised to expand the applications of gene therapy, say
the experiment represents the historic opening of a new era in
medicine.
   When the experiment was approved in July, Gerard McGarrity,
chairman of the National Institutes of Health approval panel, said:
``What we're doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines,
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal. Medicine has been
waiting thousands of years for this.''
   Tomlinson, too, has been waiting. Her parents have long been
active with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and she works there as
consumer affairs coordinator.
   She was married earlier this year and attends law school at
night. But she still makes time to follow cystic fibrosis research,
including the several-year-long debate over the ethics and risks of
gene therapy.
   The decision to proceed ``shows that society is willing to
accept this,'' she said. Criticism of the experiment was important,
because ``it makes people think about the seriousness of this
work,'' Tomlinson said.
   Scientists worry that putting new genes into the body could
trigger cancer or other problems. And some worry about the ethics
of altering human genetic makeup.
   ``But I don't want to see them (the critics) stop it,''
Tomlinson said. ``I don't want their fear of the unknown to hold us
back.''
   Last summer, researchers found the gene that is defective in
people with cystic fibrosis, and this year they showed that the
defect could be corrected in the test tube.
   The next experiment will be to try to insert the normal cystic
fibrosis gene into mice, and then try again in larger animals, such
as sheep, Beall said.
   Then human experimentation could begin. Because the most
important symptom of cystic fibrosis is the accumulation of mucus
in the lungs, an aerosol spray that delivered genetically
engineered cells to the lungs might be all that is required for
most patients.
   Tomlinson has a mild case of cystic fibrosis. She follows a
physical therapy regimen every morning to dislodge mucus in her
lungs, and she takes enzyme pills with every meal to help digest
her food.
   Several times a year she is treated for lung infections, usually
managing to avoid the hospitalizations that many people with cystic
fibrosis undergo.
   ``I've really been able to lead a full life,'' she said.
   As researchers scramble to finish the preliminary experiments to
pave the way for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis, Tomlinson is
uncertain what that means to her.
   Despite her enthusiasm, she isn't sure she'll volunteer to be
one of the first to try the new treatment.
   ``I want to be sure it works,'' she said. ``I used to do more
research, but now because there's so much going on in my life, and
I'm healthy, I guess I'm more skeptical.''

   Flu vaccination is strongly recommended for the
following groups of people, according to the federal Centers of
Disease Control in Atlanta:
   - All people over age 65.
   - Anyone between the ages of 6 months and 65 years with chronic
heart or lung problems; nursing home residents; and people under
regular medical care during the past year for diabetes, kidney
conditions, compromised immunity (including infection with the
virus that causes AIDS) or inherited blood disorders such as sickle
cell anemia and thalassemia.
   - Children under 18 receiving long-term aspirin therapy for
conditions such as arthritis. This recommendation is based on the
rare but known link in children between aspirin, influenza and the
development of Reye's syndrome, which can be fatal or cause
permanent brain damage.
   - Physicians, nurses and other health-care workers who deal with
people in the above high-risk groups, employees in nursing homes
and chronic health-care facilities, providers of home care and
household members of high-risk people.
   - Anyone who wants to reduce the chances of getting the flu.
   ---
   Who should avoid the vaccination, according to the CDC:
   - Anyone allergic to eggs. The vaccine is grown in chicken eggs,
and even though highly purified, could cause an adverse reaction.
   - Anyone with a fever, until the fever subsides.

   Scientists Grow Human Brain Cells
   In Laboratory Dishes for First Time

   For the first time, scientists have grown human brain
cells in laboratory dishes, providing an invaluable tool to
study and possibly treat nerve disorders including
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
   The test-tube culturing of a colony of brain cells was
achieved by a team of neuroscientists at Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine in Baltimore. The original cells were obtained
during brain surgery on an 18-month-old girl who suffered a
severe, untreatable kind of seizure due to an enlarged brain,
the researchers reported in this week's issue of Science.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the new research avenues opened up by the feat is
the possibility that the cultured brain cells can be
genetically altered and then transplanted into the brains of
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients as substitutes for the
damaged brain cells seen in these disorders. The Johns
Hopkins scientists are now attempting such genetic
alterations in the cultured cells, according to Solomon
Snyder, who heads the research team.
   The cultured brain cells also might provide insight into
how to get nerve cells in the spinal cord to regenerate, a
feat that would be a boon to tens of thousands of people
paralyzed by spinal-cord injuries. The cells also could be
used to test the efficacy and safety of drugs for brain
disorders, the scientists said.
   Human and animal cells cultured in laboratory dishes are a
backbone of medical research, allowing scientists to study
and experiment with tissues isolated from all the chemical
influences of the human body. Culturing of cells has led to
breakthroughs ranging from the Salk polio vaccine in the
mid-1950s, when scientists learned how to culture kidney
cells, to the discovery of the AIDS virus five years ago by
the use of cultures of human white blood cells.
   While cells of most human tissues can be cultured in the
laboratory, those from the brain and spinal cord, the
neurons, have heretofore resisted all attempts at test-tube
culture. To maintain cells in a lab dish, the cells must
repeatedly divide, and neurons simply don't divide. Even in a
human, the neurons, unlike all other cells, quit dividing at
or shortly after birth.
   Dr. Snyder said the cell-culture feat was conceived 3 1/2
years ago when one of his neuroscience graduate students,
Jeffrey S. Nye, became interested in a rare brain disorder
known as unilateral megalencephaly. In this disorder, infants
are born with one side of the brain larger than the other
side. One theory is that the neurons, which divide during
fetal life, are much slower to quit dividing on one side of
the brain than on the other side, Dr. Snyder explained.
   "Jeffrey put two and two together" and speculated that if
the neurons on the enlarged side of the brain were slow to
quit dividing, they might be forced to resume dividing in the
test tube, Dr. Snyder explained. Thus, Dr. Nye was standing
by almost two years ago when surgeons were removing part of
the enlarged brain from the 18-month-old girl. He took cells
from the removed gray matter -- the cerebral cortex, or outer
layer of the brain -- and immediately plunged them into a
nutrient broth used to maintain cells in culture.
   Most of the neurons died within three weeks, except for
two tiny colonies that have continued to divide for the last
19 months. One colony is the culture of cells described in
the report in Science.
   The cultured cells have all the appearance of being normal
neurons. Treatment with various nerve cell growth stimulators
triggers them to mature and begin developing the tiny
outgrowths that are characteristic of neurons, the scientists
said. The cells also produce a number of chemical nerve
transmitters produced by neurons in the body.
   Dr. Snyder said the medical school hasn't yet determined
which companies might be licensed to exploit the advance, or
whether Nova Pharmaceuticals Corp. would be among them. Dr.
Snyder is a founder and chief scientific adviser of Nova
Pharmaceutical. The research was supported by federal grants
and grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.

   Scientists say they took a step toward
improving bone marrow transplants for people with cancer and
radiation sickness by purifying, or isolating, a type of cell
crucial to development of blood and immunity in mice.
   Isolation of the special cell type, called a stem cell, eluded
researchers for 30 years until achieved by doctors at Stanford
University Medical Center in Northern California and Royal
Melbourne Hospital in Australia.
   The research is outlined in Friday's issue of the journal
Science.
   The researchers are well on their way to purifying human stem
cells and growing them in the laboratory, an accomplishment that
could make bone marrow transplantation safer and more available,
said Dr. Irving Weissman, a Stanford professor of pathology and
cancer biology who headed the study team.
   Bone marrow transplants are used to replace damaged or diseased
marrow, the substance inside bones that produces blood and provides
immunity from disease.
   Transplant recipients include some leukemia patients, other
cancer patients made ill by chemotherapy and radiation therapy,
people sickened by accidental radiation exposure, and those with
certain disorders of the blood and the immune system.
   Only about one in 20,000 cells in bone marrow is a stem cell,
said Weissman. But the rare cells are ultimately responsible for
making and replacing other short-lived blood cells, including red
cells, platelets and the B and T types of white blood cells
responsible for immunity.
   As a result, stem cells are the most important part of
transplanted bone marrow. But such transplants often fail unless
the donor and recipient are matched closely. That's because some
white blood cells in donor marrow attack the recipient's tissues in
a sort of reverse rejection called graft-versus-host disease.
   If human stem cells can be purified, they might be transplanted
without other cells in bone marrow, thus avoiding the failure of
the transplants, Weissman said.
   Purified human stem cells also could eliminate the need to find
closely matched marrow donors, making marrow transplants more
widely available, he added.
   Pure stem cells also could make it safer for leukemia patients
to have some of their own marrow removed and then have it replaced
later after they have been subjected to radiation therapy.
Radiation kills the remaining marrow at the same time it kills
cancer cells in marrow, he said.
   When leukemia patients have some marrow removed and later
replaced, it can contain some cancer cells, which spur recurrence
of the leukemia, or blood cancer. By separating stem cells from the
extracted marrow, the stem cells can be reimplanted free of any
cancer cells, preventing the cancer from recurring, Weissman said.
   The researcher also said that in several years, purifying human
stem cells could speed development of gene therapy for inherited
blood diseases. Gene therapy involves the replacement of
disease-causing genes _ the basic units of heredity _ with healthy
genes.

<HEAD>Fish Oil May Solve Serious Transplant Drug Problem, Says
Researcher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fish oil may help the thousands of patients
each year who receive life-saving organ transplants only to develop
serious kidney disease from the toxic effects of a drug needed to
prevent organ rejection, a researcher says.
   Dr. William M. Bennett said Monday that three medical centers
now are testing the use of fish oil to smooth out the harsh side
effects of cyclosporine, a drug taken by transplant patients to
prevent organ rejection.
   The beneficial effects of cyclosporine have made it possible for
thousands to receive kidney, heart and liver transplants. The
primary action of the drug is to supress the body's immune response.
   Side effects of the drug, however, can be very serious for
patients already in delicate health.
   Bennett, speaking at a National Kidney Foundation seminar, said
virtually every patient who takes cyclosprine suffers some change
in kidney function, probably as the result of constricted flow
through blood vessels of the kidney.
   At least one heart transplant patient, he said, has survived the
transplant operation only to suffer complete kidney failure due to
the toxic effects of cyclosporine.
   Bennett, a professor at the Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, said he and other researchers determined in laboratory
studies that by mixing cyclosporine with a fish oil high in omega-3
fatty acid its bad side effects can be reduced without blocking the
good results.
   Oil from fishes such as salmon and other cold water fish, said
Bennett, are known to reduce the formation of thromboxanes, a
protein that causes blood vessels to constrict. In laboratory
animals, he said, this effect of fish oil seems to counter kidney
damage caused by cyclosporine.
   A limited number of patients now are receiving the fish oil and
cyclosporine at clinics in Portland, Ore. and Boston, he said.
   Bennett said if the toxic effects of cyclosporine can be
countered successfully, then there may be expanded uses for the
drug. Use of cyclosporine has been suggested in such auto immune
diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and some types of diabetes.
   Another researcher at the National Kidney Foundation seminar
said extensive clinical trials are under way on a new
genetically-engineered hormone that will counter anemia among
patients who must depend on artificial kidneys.
   Dr. Joseph W. Eschbach, a professor at the University of
Washington in Seattle, said more than 100,000 Americans with failed
kidneys are receiving dialysis, a procedure that cleans the blood
of impurities normally filtered out by the kidneys.
   Up to 75,000 of these patients suffer from anemia, characterized
by a shortage in their blood of red cells, which carry oxygen to
the cells. For about 25,000, the problem is so serious that they
must receive blood transfusions.
   Because of the anemia, Eschbach said that only about a third of
the dialysis patients are able to return to work and many ``become
part of the couch. All they can do is just lie there.''
   The federal government spends about $2 billion a year caring for
dialysis patients, he said, and some of this money could be saved
if more patients were able to correct their anemia.
   Eschbach said research has shown that the reason for this anemia
is that the failed kidneys no longer produce a hormone called
erythropoietin. In normal function, the kidneys secrete this
hormone when red cells are reduced in the blood. The hormone goes
to the bone marrow and causes blood formation tissue there to make
more red blood cells.
   Scientists have now isolated the human gene that makes the
hormone. This gene has been inserted into the nucleus of Chinese
hamster ovary cells which now are producing large amounts of
erythropoietin.
   Dialysis patients who have received erythropoietin injections,
said Eschbach, have recovered from their anemia and many have
returned to work.
   Some have improved to the point that they have been able to
receive kidney transplants and are no longer on dialysis, he said.
   The hormone now is in clinical trials and is expected to be
available for general use by next spring.

   Since the era of gene splicing dawned 16 years ago, the prospect of a human gene transplant has beckoned biologists as the ultimate experiment.

   With thousands of inherited disorders awaiting cure, from sickle-cell anemia to muscular dystrophy, the lure has been strong.
But despite big strides in commercial gene splicing that have yielded such products as the heart drug TPA, human gene transplants have remained a glimmer on the horizon.

   Now the glimmer is taking form as a team of scientists at the National Institutes of Health presses an application to extend recombinant DNA technology from microbes, mice and monkeys to man.

   Today, the NIH Biosafety Committee will review a proposed experiment by scientists from two NIH units: W. French Anderson of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and Steven Rosenberg and Michael Blaese of the National Cancer Institute.
If it passes NIH safety muster, the experiment would face several more reviews, but final clearance for the trial -- the first legal gene transplant in humans -- could come as early as this fall.

   Early on, scientists hoped the first human gene transplant could achieve a dramatic cure, since many diseases result from a single defective gene.
But they have learned that transplanting a gene into a person isn't as easy as patching new genes into bacteria or yeast.
A scientist from the University of California at Los Angeles performed unauthorized gene transplants overseas in a failed attempt to cure a genetic blood disorder.

   Meanwhile, several groups researching severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), a congenital ailment made famous by a young boy in Texas who lived out his brief life in an aseptic bubble, have been plagued in laboratory work by the basic problems of getting the corrective gene into the right cells and making it function and endure.

   The work continues on SCID and other inherited ills, but with sobered respect for its difficulty.
"The field went through an early period of naive optimism that things were going to be simple," says Theodore Friedmann, a pediatrics professor at the University of California at San Diego.
"We've since learned things aren't so straightforward."

   The proposed NIH experiment doesn't aim to cure anything.
Rather, it's a back-to-basics experiment, a technical trial of gene splicing in patients already receiving treatment in an experimental cancer program being conducted by Dr. Rosenberg.
The goal is to see if a gene can be inserted into the right cells, stay there and function.

   In the cancer program, Dr. Rosenberg is testing a form of therapy combining the growth promoter interleukin-2 (IL-2) and cancer-fighting, white blood cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs.
This involves removing a piece of tumor, mincing it and isolating the TILs.
Then the scientists soak the isolated cells in IL-2 to grow massive quantities of TILs and infuse them in the patient's body, where they attack the tumor in greater force.

   The gene transplant may help the researchers monitor the cancer trial.
Dr. Blaese and his colleagues plan to implant a "marker" gene in the TIL cells that would enable scientists to track the cells' migration in the body back to the tumor site.
Later the marker could be used as a hook to fish out the cancer-fighting cells and check their behavior in a test tube.

   "We'll see where the cells go in the body, and how long they live," says Dr. Blaese.
"Later, we'll examine them in the test tube and see if they're still behaving as (TILs)."

   If the gene transplant works, the lessons could be applied to future therapeutic experiments, Dr. Blaese says.
"We can see if we can soup them up (the cancer-fighting cells) to make them more effective," he says, perhaps by inserting a gene to manufacture substances like IL-2 to help fight the tumor.

   Subjects in the gene-transplant experiment would be volunteers with advanced cancer and limited life expectancy who already have consented to the risks of the experimental cancer treatment.
Scientists say these factors should ease ethical qualms.

   Even so, safety issues at today's NIH meeting are likely to stir great public interest.
Such interest is fanned by fear of the unknown and anxiety about eugenics -- a leap beyond curing disease to endowing people with specific traits.
That, of course, is futuristic fantasy for now.
But even in the case of a technical experiment, scientists appreciate the public's wariness.

   "Gene therapy is a sensitive issue to both the scientific community and to the public at large," says Richard O'Reilly, pediatrics chairman and leader of a genetherapy research program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
While assessing potential hazards is difficult, he says, "I expect the risks to be extremely low."

   Much of the debate probably will concern the proposed use of a cancer virus, the Moloney mouse leukemia virus, as a vehicle to deposit the marker gene into the cancer patients' cells.
The Moloney virus isn't known to cause disease in humans.
Moreover, it is crippled -- stripped of its native genes -- to keep it from spreading.

   Still, the developer of this carrier-virus, Eli Gilboa of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, says that even though the virus is crippled, certain precautions are necessary.
"It is important to ascertain that the viral stocks used are free from helper viruses," he says, referring to stray viruses that exist in nature like a traveling stock of spare parts to repair crippled neighboring viruses.
A helper potentially could restore a crippled lab virus to full virulence.
Dr. Blaese says studies he has done show that the crippled virus in the stocks he would use isn't replicating and is free of such virulent helpers.

   Unpublished animal studies of the test's safety show that both healthy and immune-suppressed monkeys given huge doses of Moloney virus show "no ill effects," Dr. Blaese says.
"And I don't anticipate any."
It is unusual for scientists to proceed to human tests before animal studies are completed.
But Dr. Blaese says he expects to finish the animal tests by October, when the proposal would go before the full NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.

   Once the gene is inserted in the human TIL cells, another safety check would be made.
Dr. Blaese says the team would observe the cells in the test tube before reinfusing them into cancer patients "to make sure insertion of the gene doesn't make them grow abnormally" like a cancer cell.
"We think chances of this are incredibly tiny," he adds.

   Some specialists say an extra level of safety would be desirable but is technically unfeasible.
"The only thing that would make me feel better about (the NIH experiment) would be to put in a second marker gene as a fail-safe, to allow you to kill all the cells of that lineage at will if something went wrong," one researcher says.
But he and other scientists acknowledge that such techniques haven't been perfected yet.

   "You'd like something to shut the system off," Dr. Blaese says.
But so far, he adds, "we don't have one that functions."

   Science is at the point where human
diseases can be attacked on the molecular level, doctors said
Wednesday at the opening of a $50 million center devoted to joining
laboratory work and patient care.
   More than 20 international scientists, including five Nobel
Prize winners, gathered at ceremonies and a symposium at the
Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine at Stanford
University.
   ``I don't think it's too far off base to say that the new era of
genetic and molecular medicine will offer changes as significant to
medical sciences as occurred more than 100 years ago when
scientists discovered that bacteria were the underlying cause of
disease,'' said Nobelist Paul Berg, director of the center.
   David Korn, dean of Stanford's medical school, said the center
has attracted at least 40 ``world-class medical scientists'' and
would have an annual budget of $20 million to $40 million.
   The center, adjacent to Stanford Hospital, has brought together
such researchers as molecular scientists and doctors specializing
in pediatrics, infectious diseases and other areas.
   ``The right mind, looking at a frustrating clinical problem can
often come up with an insight, which if transferred back into the
right scientific environment, can open up a whole new field of
research,'' Korn said.
   Other Nobel laureates at the symposium were David Baltimore of
the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Michael Brown and
Joseph Goldstein of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
School and Arthur Kornberg of Stanford.
   Controlling genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and
certain cancers, through molecular genetics were among the papers
presented at the three-day symposium.
   ``All along we've said that this line of research will lead to
significant advances and benefits in medicine,'' said Berg. ``Now I
think they are very close at hand. In the next decade, the impact
of molecular genetics in medicine will be mind-boggling. I expect
we'll see a succession of major breakthroughs in understanding and,
ultimately, in dealing with human disease.''
   Researchers in molecular and genetic medicine seek to understand
human disease or physiology in terms of molecules and genes, Berg
said.
   ``The idea of the program is to reach out and encompass
everybody who shares that same philosophical perspective,'' he said.
   The center and a few others like it will speed up application of
research work because they provide ``a very necessary channel of
communication between the patient and the laboratory,'' Korn said.
``It really is a two-way street. It isn't only from the laboratory
to the bedside.''
   Molecular biologists are probing genetic susceptibility in
people to particular forms of arthritic disease and identifying
certain kinds of cells that cause arthritic damage. The researchers
are trying to inactivate those specific harmful cells without
shutting down the whole immune system.
   The same strategy is being used in infantile diabetes and
multiple sclerosis.
   There also is evidence that certain genetically designed growth
hormones would allow doctors to push radiation therapy and
chemotherapy to higher levels than ever in fighting cancer. The
hormones would be used to protect and rescue the bone marrow from
obliteration by the therapy.
   Another area of research is the search for a tiny group of
powerful cells that, when activated by a hormone, specifically go
after kidney cancers without injuring anything else.
   ``Talk about magic bullets! This is a kind of magic bullet that
everybody's been looking for,'' Korn said.
   Still another frontier of research is the study of how cells in
the nervous system communicate with each other on a molecular level.
   Korn cautioned against misinterpreting scientists' enthusiasm
for breakthroughs in the laboratories, or successful tests with
some patients, with promises of imminent cures for cancer and other
diseases.
   ``I do think this is a revolution and I do think that molecular
biology is going to have as profound effects on medicine as
anything that's happened in the history of biological science,'' he
said. ``But I'm not going to tell you that one year from now we
will have cures for a lot of diseases.''

PROFOUND RIGHTS QUESTIONS PRESENTED BY GENETIC TESTING
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate over genetic testing will involve profound questions about the
boundaries between the rights of individuals and the rights of employers and
insurers. The manner in which society answers these questions, experts say,
will rival in significance earlier challenges in the civil rights and workers'
rights arenas.
</P>
<P>
The parallel is apt. Some of the earliest documented cases of discriminatory
genetic screening relate to sickle-cell anemia, an inherited blood disease that
affects blacks almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
This potentially fatal disease results from a single gene defect that causes a
deformation of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. It became the object of
widespread screening in the United States in the early 1970s, partly in
response to demands by the black community for better health care.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, however, observers recognized in the programs a
double-edged sword, with evidence that some employers might be using test
results to discriminate against blacks. Even "carriers" of the disease -- those
whose chromosomes contain only one of two possible genes for the disease and
who generally show no ill effects -- were sometimes denied jobs as airline
pilots, deferred from some branches of the armed forces and saddled with higher
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
Several states have since passed laws against the misuse of sickle-cell
screening. But those early cases put minorities on notice that genetic testing
has more than therapeutic possibilities. And now, with the genes for other
diseases and medical predispositions coming into focus, every individual
becomes, in a sense, a minority member with particular odds of suffering a
particular medical fate. RICK WEISS

<HL> GM-CSF, Potential Therapy, May Assist AIDS Virus in Some Cells, Group Reports </HL>

<TEXT>
   Scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles reported that the protein GM-CSF may boost production of an AIDS virus strain in certain types of cells, calling for caution in its use as a treatment for the fatal syndrome.

   GM-CSF, a blood-cell growth factor, is being tested against a number of diseases, including cancer and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in an effort to combat the suppression of white blood cells by the disease itself or as result of chemotherapy.
Lowered white blood-cell counts can lead to life-threatening infections.

   Previously, scientists led by Jerome Groopman of Harvard University had shown that GM-CSF given in daily injections to AIDS patients produced a significant rise in white blood cells, without serious side effects and without any consistent rise in viral production.

   However, the UCLA Medical School researchers said in today's issue of Science that GM-CSF and other blood-cell growth factors, M-CSF and IL-3, "showed large increases" in the amount of virus produced in cell culture.
Another member of the family, G-CSF, didn't boost viral production, added the researchers, who were led by Yoshio Koyonagi and Irvin S.Y. Chen.

   The study examined one particular AIDS virus strain, which principally attacks cells known as monocyte-macrophages, and which was taken from a patient afflicted with an AIDS-related brain disorder known as encephalopathy, where such cells are known to play a major role in the progress of the disease.

   It isn't known how many AIDS patients overall are infected by a similar strain, and thus how many might respond similarly to GM-CSF.
However, scientists have known for more than two years that the AIDS virus attacks not only T-cells -- white blood cells responsible for immune regulation -- but also monocyte-macrophages.
The latter cells act normally as scavengers that eat up invading organisms, but also may be responsible for cell-to-cell infection of the AIDS virus.

   Currently, synthetic versions of GM-CSF are produced by biotechnology companies, including Schering-Plough Corp., Immunex Corp. and Genetics Institute Inc. in collaboration with Sandoz Inc.

   Dr. Groopman yesterday characterized the paper as "interesting," but "one which needs to be put in perspective."
Different behaviors of different strains of the AIDS virus shouldn't dampen research into GM-CSF, he said.
His clinical data on GM-CSF don't support the notion that the agent exacerbates viral production.

   Secondly, Dr. Groopman said he isn't giving GM-CSF to AIDS patients as a single agent any longer, but rather in combination with the antiviral drug AZT; researchers believe the two may be synergistic, with GM-CSF countering the bone-marrow suppression brought on by AZT therapy.
Currently, 10 patients are receiving the drugs in a clinical test, and doctors plan to double that number, he said.

   David W. Golde, UCLA's chief of the division of Hematology and Oncology, and a co-author of the Science paper, stressed that research into GM-CSF as an immune booster for AIDS patients should proceed, but with caution.
Such blood-cell growth factors among the "most promising {areas} related to AIDS," he concurred, but added that "they have to be used with care."

   In late 1986, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made the first observation that GM-CSF could stimulate viral production in cell culture.
Then, as now, Dr. Fauci said yesterday, "the clinical implications are uncertain.
But the fact that {other} researchers are finding that it happens in other strains raises the possibility of a detrimental clinical effect."

   Dystrophy Treatment Passes Safety Test

   The first potential treatment for muscular dystrophy
passed early safety tests and offered a glimpse of the kind
of payoffs that might come from mapping the 50,000 to 100,000
genes in the human genome. The effectiveness of the
treatment, however, isn't known.
   Neurologists in Montreal said that doses of normal muscle
cells had been safely and successfully injected into a single
afflicted arm muscle of each of three boys with muscular
dystrophy. Seven other boys will receive the experimental
treatment in coming months. All the boys are aged six to
eight years and are suffering the early stages of muscular
dystrophy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The injected normal cells, it is hoped, will supply a
muscle protein, the lack of which is the cause of the
relentless deterioration of the muscles that is the hallmark
of muscular dystrophy.
   It will be several months before the Canadian researchers
can determine whether the injected muscle cells will produce
the protein and whether the protein will stop or reverse the
steady weakening of the surrounding muscle. Effectiveness
will be judged by comparing, in each boy, the strength of the
biceps in the treated arm with the strength of the biceps in
the opposing arm which received only injections of salt
water.
   "For the first time in a large muscle, we've determined
that the procedure is feasible as well as safe," neurologist
George Karpati of the Montreal Neurological Institute
reported on behalf of a team involving scientists from five
Canadian medical institutions.
   In a telephone interview, Dr. Karpati said many
researchers had been skeptical that the experiment could be
done. The Canadian team, he explained, had now shown that it
is possible to take a few immature muscle cells and culture
them in the test tube to produce millions of copies. Each boy
received up to 55 injections of one million copies each of
his father's myoblasts, which are immature muscle cells.
   The first three boys receiving the injections also showed
that the procedure was free of the adverse effects that some
researchers had feared, Dr. Karpati said.
   The Montreal announcement differs from a similar report
made early this month by researchers at the University of
Tennessee in that it involves a much larger muscle. The
Tennessee scientists injected normal muscle cells into a
small foot muscle of eight boys with the disorder. The
treated muscle controls the big toe; the first of the eight
boys to be treated has experienced a slight increase in
strength of the treated toe, the researchers reported.
   The technique, technically known as myoblast transfer,
also will be tried this summer by research teams in Boston
and San Francisco.
   The unprecedented advance against muscular dystrophy now
under way is giving impetus to the organized effort to locate
and identify all 50,000 to 100,000 human genes, an effort
known as the human genome project. Scientists say muscular
dystrophy is the first and most dramatic example of how gene
mapping can lead to the conquest of a genetic disease.
   Although muscular dystrophy was first recognized as a
distinct disorder in the 1870s, its cause baffled scientists
for more than a century. They knew only that it was caused by
a defective gene that was inherited from the mother and that
it showed up almost exclusively in boys.
   In the early 1980s, new techniques for locating and
identifying, or "mapping," unknown genes began to emerge from
biology laboratories. In the summer of 1983, the Muscular
Dystrophy Association, which is best known for its annual
Jerry Lewis Telethon, picked three teams of scientists to use
the new gene-mapping techniques for a $5 million crash search
for the muscular dystrophy gene.
   In the fall of 1986, the team at Boston's Children's
Hospital, led by molecular geneticist Louis Kunkel, found the
muscular dystrophy gene, edging out by only a few months a
competing team at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
Within a year, the Boston researchers found that the normal
version of the defective muscular dystrophy gene produced a
protein that they dubbed dystrophin.
   It was quickly discovered that boys suffering the most
common and severest form of the disease, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, completely lacked dystrophin, while those with a
milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy, had defective
versions of the protein.
   What dystrophin normally does in muscle tissues and how
its lack leads to the muscle deterioration seen in muscular
dystrophy isn't known. But dystrophin's clear link to the
disease led to the current experiments to see if
transplanting normal dystrophin-producing muscle cells will
prevent the deterioration of particular muscles in afflicted
boys.
   If the transplanted cells "take" and their dystrophin does
in fact stem the destruction of the surrounding bicep muscle,
researchers would still have to figure out how to treat the
entire patient rather than a single muscle. "The next phase
would be to go on and try to inject multiple muscles,"
particularly the muscles involved in breathing, walking and
arm movements, Dr. Karpati said.
