<HEAD>Appeals Court Say Takeover Attempt May Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fried chicken king Al Copeland may resume his
$290 million takeover attempt against Church's Fried Chicken, a
federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Peter Butler, attorney for A. Copeland
Enterprises Inc. _ the company which owns New Orleans-based Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken _ after Judge Henry A. Politz announced the
decision for the three-judge 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel.
   ``The stay is lifted,'' said Butler. ``We'll move forward with
all haste, and leave it to the shareholders as to whether or not to
believe our offer is a reasonable one.''
   A hearing is set Wednesday in federal court in San Antonio,
Texas, where Popeyes is fighting ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
bylaws which Church's adopted Nov. 4, more than a week after Popeyes
made its offer. Church's is headquartered in San Antonio.
   ``I don't consider that a major obstacle,'' said Butler.
   The judges announced their decision 35 minutes after arguments
were over. They did not go into their reasons for upholding the
ruling handed down Nov. 28 by U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz,
saying only that they affirmed it on all points.
   ``We neither approve nor disapprove of the reasons for that
decision,'' Politz said.
   Guy M. Struve, the New York attorney representing Church's, said
he was disappointed and did not know when the chain would decide
whether to appeal Thursday's ruling.
   Struve argued that the $8-a-share takeover bid should be halted
because it was based on insider information provided by a former
Church's executive now employed by Popeyes, and because merging the
nation's No. 2 and 3 fried chicken chains would violate federal
antitrust laws.
   Sam Kadet of the corporate law firm of Skadden, Arps said Popeyes
could give Church's notice on Thursday that it planned to proceed
with the takeover attempt and deliver the information to Church's
after five business days. Popeyes would have 12 more business days
after that to close the deal, he said.
   The chain has said that it owns 3.2 percent of Church's stock and
has been tendered another 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of the
35.9 million shares outstanding.

HIP HAMLET AND LADY M. SET OUT ON A ROCK 'N' ROLL RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call her Lady M. Paint him Candide. Throw in a golden-tressed Hamlet and you've 
got the hippest new trio in Los Angeles. "Shout and Twist," a production at the 
Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles, is a high-concept rock 'n' roll ride 
through a world of educated camp: puns, one-liners, madcap energy, soulful 
ballads, sarcastic divas, New York angst, Day-Glo makeup and truly nutzoid 
props. Plus the classics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an accident that we picked those three characters," said co-star 
Michael Butler, who created the piece with Johann (pronounced Joann) Carlo, the 
stain-handed Lady Macbeth, and Henry Stram. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's Candide, for example, "is an archetype for a real guitar hero, someone 
with lots of interests, who bounces from one thing to the next: est one week, 
gurus the next. Lady M. is the whole idea of rock stars being today's kings and 
queens. And Hamlet, with all of his self-involvement, is more of a guy for this 
time than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The piece had its first birth pangs in 1981, when Carlo and Butler hooked up 
romantically and professionally. He was playing Candide at the Guthrie Theatre; 
she and Henry Stram were also in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
On nights off, "basically out of boredom, we started writing songs," Carlo 
recalled, "and convinced our director to let us do the club circuit. See, in 
theater, everyone's polite. In clubs, people tell you what they think. We 
wanted to bridge those two elements." 
</P>
<P>
 In the club setting, their transition from actors to actor-singer-writers was 
blissfully organic. "We didn't just stand up there and sing songs," said 
Butler, who also plays guitar and keyboard in the show's score. (Titles include 
"I'm Going Steady" and "Out Damned Spot.") 
</P>
<P>
"We staged them, made performances. Just standing up on a stage, the back beat 
kicks in -- and you don't have any problem getting inspired. There aren't many 
ventures where you get to do all those things. Why not do it all?" 
</P>
<P>
The confidence is well-earned. Butler is a graduate of Juilliard, a former 
dancer with the Erick Hawkins Dance Company and cast member of the recent 
Broadway production of "Macbeth." Carlo studied in London, was on Broadway in 
"Plenty" and on TV's "Crime Story" as the pouty wife of mobster Ray Luca. 
Together, they staged half a dozen original works in New York, including "It's 
Still Life," which was commissioned by the Whitney Museum and later toured 
India and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
The pair, who consider New York their base, say they rely on intuition to 
evaluate their work. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also trained that intuition," Carlo said. "So it's not coming from just 
anywhere. It's also from doing a lot of different plays; your instrument gets 
in tune. What's funny, though, is all the things people read into the work. 
They start talking about what this is and what that means, and you say 'What?' 
Then afterward you say, 'Oh, I guess it really is that.' Or a person can read 
something interesting into something, and it spins off into another idea for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Although they've yet to hit it big (Butler describes their artistic existence 
as "trying, trying, trying"), it is a satisfying life. "The best part of what 
we do is traveling," Carlo said. "You get to meet people, you get to create. I 
get so much from different places, different cultures. Hopefully, it'll sift 
its way through the work, become part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"And the fact that we're a couple makes it all better. We work together, are 
together. It's hard going sometimes, but basically Michael and I are very happy 
together. So what could be so terrible?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that their work follows them everywhere? "Our relationship is our 
work," Carlo said firmly. She sees little indication of that changing. "It's 
the community we hang in. I love to cook, make pasta. But it's always artists 
coming in and out, discussing their work. What else is there to talk about? 
</P>
<P>
"As far as Michael and me, our sensibilities are very much the same; we don't 
have any problems," she said. "The only problems we have are when we work with 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shout &amp; Twist" plays at the Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., 
Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m. and Sundays at 7 
p.m., indefinitely. (213) 477-2055. Tickets: $17 to $21.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO; 
</P>
<P>
DRUMMER TONY WILLIAMS STICKS WITH RAW TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drummer Tony Williams is living proof that you don't have to forsake melodies 
or a beat to make a new musical statement. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who plays the City College Theater with his acoustic quintet at 8 
p.m. Monday in a show co-presented by KSDS-FM (88.3) and the San Diego Jazz 
Festival, uses his raw talent to create within the limits of straight-ahead 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
A child prodigy who was playing drums in Boston clubs with his saxophonist 
father before his teens, Williams went to New York to join Jackie McLean's band 
when he was only 16. With bassist Ron Carter and pianist Herbie Hancock, 
Williams completed the rhythm section that propelled trumpeter Miles Davis 
through such seminal '60s albums as "In a Silent Way," "Miles in the Sky" and 
"Miles Smiles," albums that marked the birth of the rock/jazz marriage known 
today as fusion. 
</P>
<P>
But it was when he left Davis in the late '60s that Williams began to find 
himself, melding elements of jazz and rock in a band called Tony Williams 
Lifetime with guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' current band, together since 1985, is loaded with talent: pianist 
Mulgrew Miller, trumpeter Wallace Roney, sax man Billy Pierce and bassists Bob 
Hurst and Ira Coleman. Miller has been getting praise for his own debut solo 
album. 
</P>
<P>
With this band, Williams seems to have found an ideal setting. The music, 
composed by Williams, is powered by his crisp stick work: rapidly shifting 
layers of rhythms coming from carefully tuned drums that almost give his 
playing a melodic quality. His crisp rolls and deft cymbal work have become a 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
The drummer won't say much about the group, which recently released "Angel 
Street," its third album. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a band like this before. I like trying things that haven't been 
tried. . . . The music? I can't put it into words. If you could explain music, 
you wouldn't need music." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego marks the halfway point on the band's six-week tour of the United 
States and Canada. In August, they'll be playing jazz festivals in Japan. 
Tickets for the San Diego show are $12 ($14 at the door), available at all 
Ticketmaster locations or from the KSDS studios (234-1062). 
</P>
<P>
The show is the first of what KSDS and the Jazz Festival hope will be a series 
of jointly presented summer jazz concerts. Williams will be interviewed on KSDS 
at 3 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Henry Butler, who opened a three-week gig at Elario's last night, has 
most often been likened to pianist McCoy Tyner. But any similarities in their 
percussive attacks are more coincidence than the result of direct influences, 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, Butler's aggressive approach developed quite independently. He began 
his musical career as a grammar school drummer, which instilled strong rhythms, 
and he grew up in New Orleans, "which probably has more good drummers than any 
city its size in this country," he said. 'With that kind of environment, one 
almost had to be percussive." 
</P>
<P>
Butler counts pianist Keith Jarrett and saxophone giant John Coltrane among his 
influences. He has many talents beyond the piano: Besides singing and 
composing, he also takes pictures, all the more impressive because Butler is 
blind. "A moron can take a picture," he said. "A dog can do it if he knows 
which button to choose with his paw." Butler's photos, though, aren't dogs. 
They've been shown around the country to favorable reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In La Jolla, he'll be backed by San Diegans Jim Plank on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Centro Cultural in Tijuana, two groups of Southern 
California musicians will present "Homenaje a Charlie Parker," a memorial to 
the pioneering bebopper. One band includes local sax man Charles McPherson, 
one-time L.A. Express drummer John Guerin, pianist Frank Strazzeri and 
trumpeter Chuck Findley. The other consists of pianist Mel Goot, drummer Carlos 
Vasquez, percussionist Armando Rosas, bassist Bill Andrews, Mexican saxophone 
player Esteban Favela, San Diegan Bruce Cameron on trumpet and possibly Coral 
Thuet on vocals. Consider the event an early birthday party: Parker was born 
Aug. 29, 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarists Al DiMeola and Larry Coryell electrified listeners with their fusion 
work in the '70s, DiMeola with Chick Corea in Return to Forever, Coryell 
leading his own bands, including The Eleventh House. Both are also prodigious 
talents on acoustic guitar. On June 21, they join hot young French guitarist 
Birelli Lagrene in a "Super Guitar Trio" at the Bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Animal Logic, the band put together by bassist Stanley Clarke and former 
Police drummer Stewart Copeland, hits the Bacchanal on Monday. . . . KSWV-FM 
(102.9), which, with the help of disc jockey Art Good (formerly of KIFM), stole 
the Catamaran's Cannibal Bar away from KIFM's Lites Out circuit for its own 
Jazz Nite, has added a second club to its promotional lineup: the Full Moon in 
Encinitas, which holds its "Moonlight Jazz" nights every Sunday. This week, the 
club features the Mark Lessman Band. The Wave thus beats KIFM to the punch with 
a club promotion in North County, ripe territory for light-jazz lovers. . . . 
Spencer Nilsen, whose "Architects of Change" album is a mainstay of local 
contemporary jazz stations, is considering recording an extended dance version 
of "Church on Wall St." from the album. . . . New Age band Shadowfax, which 
claims to have used more than 150 instruments from all over the world on its 
new album, "Folk Songs for a Nuclear Village," plays the Del Mar Fair at 7:30 
p.m. Sunday.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Property: An English Tuscany - A touch of old Italy in
historic Worcestershire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flat river bottoms and stumpy hills make Worcestershire an English version
of Tuscany as we see it in early Italian paintings. But green is the
dominant colour, not white or beige.
Much of that green comes from flooding by the county's rivers. At its core,
they have formed a large plain between hills on three sides. Chief among
them is the Severn, which starts in neighbouring Wales and flows through
Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester to the Bristol Channel. Others include
the Teme, the Stour and the Avon (known better at Stratford-upon-Avon,
Shakespeare's birthplace). The rivers were the main transport link before
the Industrial Revolution brought the railways.
The Malvern Hills bound Worcestershire on the west. To the north-east, the
Clent and Lickey Hills separate the county from greater Birmingham. To the
east are the Cotswolds.
Birmingham, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Bristol are reached easily on the M5
motorway. For London, though, you must take a route that starts in the wrong
direction - north, towards Birmingham. Then it turns east onto the M42 (the
Birmingham southern ring road) and south-east to the M40 for a 2 1/2 -hour
drive to the capital.
Worcester's county cricket ground - among the most beautiful in England -
has been flooded often by the Severn. It is just across the bridge from the
town centre, ideal for spectators fleeing the office on summer afternoons.
If the players flag, they can look to the nearby cathedral for inspiration.
The racecourse is also in the water meadows and just as easy to reach.
It is a fertile county and farming thrives, notably fruit and vegetables in
the Vale of Evesham. Wool from Wales and the Cotswolds made textiles a big
business which survives - just - in a few carpet factories at Kidderminster.
Potting, the other traditional speciality, can be seen at the Royal
Worcester works.
Worcestershire's many handsome Georgian facades show how all the county's
towns prospered in the 18th century. Brick replaced the traditional timber
framing, with its black- painted beams which make a bold check pattern
against the white lath and plaster infill. But some half-timbering did
continue into Victorian times - and the 20th century - as a veneer over the
brick.
Bewdley is one such Georgian town, a place of narrow streets and striking
houses where Stanley Baldwin, prime minister at the time of Edward VIII's
abdication in 1936 and later Earl Baldwin of Bewdley, was born. Quays on the
Severn flank a substantial bridge (designed by Thomas Telford) leading to a
broad market place where people from both sides of the river could trade.
Late in the 18th century, though, it was eclipsed by the new town of
Stourport.
Two grand red brick houses in Bewdley, needing work but both with plenty of
potential, are on offer from Andrew Grant. Tickenhill Manor, listed grade
II* for its history and Georgian architecture, was Crown property until
1873. Henry VII's eldest son, Prince Arthur, married Catherine of Aragon by
proxy at Tickenhill's chapel in 1499. Henry VIII made the house into a place
for his daughter, Mary.
In the Civil War, it was a royalist stronghold (as, indeed, the county was
generally; Worcester itself was 'the faithful city' where Charles II took
refuge, before fleeing abroad, after losing the battle of Worcester in
1651).
The house, on high ground above Bewdley with open country behind, has a
bow-fronted dining room and panelled drawing room, while the main bedrooms
have windows to the floor. Asking price is Pounds 310,000.
The other house, Kateshill, for which Pounds 290,000 is sought, was on the
Tickenhill estate. Originally Hillside House, it was renamed for Catherine
of Braganza, wife of Charles II, who liked its views. It has good-sized
rooms, cornices galore and a double flight of steps to the front door.
The garden is sombre, dark-leaved Victorian but a fine backdrop for the
rhododendrons when in flower. Its glory is a huge Spanish sweet chestnut
planted by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord High Admiral of England, to celebrate the
birth of a daughter.
Priced at Pounds 425,000 is another brick house, Newbury, at Lower
Broadheath near Worcester; this village was the birthplace of Sir Edward
Elgar, the composer. Agent Stewart White (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's associate)
also offers the brick Manor House at Clifton-upon-Teme, 11 miles from
Worcester, for Pounds 325,000. In Pershore, Grant has a Georgian brick
townhouse, Abbey Place, for Pounds 190,000.
Traditional black and white houses include Tundridge Grange at Suckley, near
Malvern; this is a warm and welcoming house in good condition (Grant, Pounds
550,000) with 35 acres for horses and a badminton court. Then there is
Detton Mill House at Neen Savage, 12 miles from Kidderminster (White, Pounds
235,000).
In Bretforton, near Evesham, Jackson-Stops offers the stone Church Cottage
for Pounds 138,500, and the modern stone and half- timbered Greenacres for
Pounds 210,000.
Broadway, on the west scarp of the Cotswolds, is one of the tourist haunts
of England - a show village where you can browse in antique shops and
recover (expensively) in the Lygon Arms, part of the Savoy Group. Its
architecture is a harmony of building styles dating back to the 16th
century, with houses flanking a long high street descending a hill.
Pond Close Farm, which backs on to nine acres of land, is both Georgian and
pre-Georgian. Rural behind and urban in front, it has a superb stone-flagged
floor in the hall, while the Cotswold teddy bear museum is across the road.
The agent is Butler Sherborn (Pounds 485,000). In the centre of Broadway,
Jackson-Stops is selling the imposing early-Georgian Picton House, now
partly an antiques shop, for Pounds 685,000.
Further information: Butler Sherborn, Burford (0993-822 325); Andrew Grant,
Worcester (0905-24 477); Jackson-Stops, Chipping Campden (0386-840 224);

<P>
Eric Holtz of Simi Valley said it was mere coincidence that, on his birthday, 
he scored three times to account for the South's only goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 The South got four opportunities to score on penalty shots in the last minutes 
of its 3-2 victory over the West on Friday in U. S. Olympic Festival field 
hockey action at Augsburg College's Nelson Anderson Field. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who attempted them all? 
</P>
<P>
What a coincidence! 
</P>
<P>
The last one, from 10 yards, came with 10 seconds left in the game and eluded 
West goalie Robbie Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the celebration was on. Holtz first was mobbed by teammates, then 
presented with a birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The South, composed of 15 members of the U. S. national team -- including nine 
from the Valley area -- finished round-robin play with a 5-1 record. It will 
face the East (4-1-1) in the gold-medal game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The West, which is 1-3-2 and will play for a bronze medal, scored its only two 
goals in the game's first 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Hoang of Westlake Village scored 11 minutes into the game and, two 
minutes later, younger brother Binh duplicated the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Holtz's goals came off a penalty corner, which is essentially a free 
shot on goal from any place more than 10 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TABLE TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
The team of Lan Vuong of Reseda and Scott Butler of Iowa City, Iowa, lost in 
the gold-medal match of the mixed doubles competition, falling to Sean O'Neill 
of McLean, Va., and Li Ai of Colorado Springs, Colo., 9-21, 21-18, 21-18. But 
Vuong and Butler captured the silver medal for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Butler of Iowa City and Carol Davidson of North Hollywood fell in the 
quarterfinals, losing to Brandon Olson of Hopkins, Minn., and Takako Trenholme 
of Minneapolis, 21-17, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Gold is the goal for Coley Kyman and Ken Lynch, North team members from Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The North routed the East, 15-5, 15-11, 15-10 at Williams Arena on Friday to 
clinch a spot in Sunday's gold-medal game. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman, from Reseda, and Lynch, from Malibu, had nine and three kills, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Duncan Blackman led the North with 16 kills and a .461 hitting 
percentage, same as Kyman's. 
</P>
<P>
The South, led by John Ross of Canoga Park, also advanced to the championship 
match with a 9-15, 15-4, 11-15, 15-7, 15-12 win over the West. Ross has 16 
kills, eight digs, eight block assists and a .500 attacking percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Reznick of Cal State Northridge had 62 assists and a match-high 12 digs 
for the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRACK 
</P>
<P>
Percy Knox is best known as a long jumper, but he earned a silver medal as a 
sprinter in the 4 X 100-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, from Lancaster, teamed with Mark Olivier of Mesa, Ariz., Bryan 
Bridgewater of Los Angeles and Jeff Williams of Montrose to place second with a 
time of 38.83. 
</P>
<P>
The South team of Henry Neal (Dallas), Lee McNeill (Lumberton, N.C.), Antonio 
Smith (Wichita, Kan.) and Kenny Brokenburr (Winterhaven, Fla.) won the race in 
38.79. 
</P>
<P>
In women's competition, Victoria Herazo of Newhall was fourth in the 
10-kilometer walk with a time of 49 minutes, 26.95 seconds. Debbie Lawrence of 
Kenosha, Wis., broke her national record in winning the race in 46:10.26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TEAM HANDBALL 
</P>
<P>
The West team broke into the win column, 20-16, over the South as Denny Fercho 
of Camarillo scored twice.

<HEAD>Court Rules Popeyes Must Give Notice on Before Buying Church's

   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits must
give five days notice if it decides to go ahead with efforts to take
over Church's Fried Chicken before a court ruling on Church's
pending appeal, a federal court says.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal on Thursday ordered New
Orleans-based Popeyes not to buy Church's stock without notice until
the Jan. 12 hearing on the San Antonio-based company's fight against
a takeover.
   Church's has asked the 5th Circuit to stop Popeyes $290 million
takeover bid, claiming it is based on information misappropriated by
two former Church's employees now working for Popeyes.
   Ernest E. Renaud, president of Church's, called the ruling a
victory for his company, the No. 2 fried chicken outlet in the
country.
   ``Popeyes isn't going anywhere for the time being and I believe
we have a good shot at winning on appeal because the case law is in
Church's favor,'' Renaud said.
   Popeyes attorney, Peter Butler, said the ruling doesn't slow down
the effort by Popeyes' owner Al Copeland to buy Church's stock with
an $8-dollar-a-share tender offer, which expires tonight. Church's
board of directors is trying to find other buyers to fend off
Popeyes buyout offer, which it has said is not enough.
   ``We're delighted,'' Butler said. ``The ruling still allows us to
disseminate our disclosures as ordered by the district court, and
get the clock moving toward having that injunction lifted.''
   U. S. District Court Judge Charles Schwartz refused to stop
Popeyes effort to take over Church's but ordered that it not proceed
until 10 days after the company disclosed further information to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Church's stockholders.
   ``Actually, the action by the 5th Circuit does nothing to set us
back and we will be getting one primary obstacle lifted once the
10-day period is over and the district court injunction is lifted,''
Butler said.

   North American Ventures Inc., which has agreed to acquire Butler International Inc. for about $139 million, said it purchased one million Butler shares from Gabelli Asset Management Co. 

   North American has offered $20.50 a share for Butler, a Montvale, N.J., aviation services company. 
At the time the offer was announced, Mario Gabelli, chairman of the New York-based investment company, expressed disappointment with the offer and said he would try to find another bid for Butler. 

   North American, a holding company whose interests include a leather-goods concern, paid $19.25 a share in cash for the Gabelli holding, about 15% of the Butler's shares outstanding. 
The Gabelli group still owns about 437,100 Butler shares. 
The $20.50 offer is $16 in cash and $4.50 in stock. 

   The acquisition, subject to approval by Butler shareholders, is expected to be completed in early 1987. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Butler shares closed at $18.25, unchanged.

   Thieves burglarized the offices of the
U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia, who has been conducting a
highly publicized investigation into allegations of defense
contracting fraud at the Pentagon.
   About six suites of a commercial office building in Alexandria,
Va., across the Potomac River from Washington, were broken into
sometime between 9:30 p.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, Dennis Butler,
a spokesman for the Alexandria Police Department, said Tuesday.
   Butler said it appeared that the burglars entered the building
through an unlocked door and punched holes through the gypsum board
walls to gain access to the offices, which included the suites of
U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson and a private law firm.
   The only items missing were two videocassette recorders and a
television set, Butler said. No confidential material was stolen.
   An aide to Hudson said the offices that were broken into
contained no confidential files or information about criminal
matters. Such information is stored in a more secure part of the
office to which the thieves did not gain access.

<DD> 10/17/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<DATELINE> In both its form and content this ventriloquistic novel  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves. 
In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them. 
It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants. 

   As the narrator Stevens, the solitary butler of Darlington Hall, mulls over such hallowed terms as "greatness," "dignity," "service" and "loyalty," we see how pious cant subverts the soul. 
Stevens's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve. 
Such armor crushes the soldier. 
The mask cuts to the quick. 

   It's 1956, the year the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire. 
As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall, where a former housekeeper resides, perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage, perhaps (he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge) not disinclined to return to domestic service, Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we're reading: 

   "We call this land of ours Great Britain, and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice. 
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective. . . . 
It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart. 
What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint. 
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, of its own greatness, and feels no need to shout it. 
In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness." 

   An effusive landscape? 
An ill-mannered mountain? 
But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner (his conscious efforts at "banter" always fail -- most comically): "This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years: what is a `great' butler?" 
His answer is one "possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position." 
Such dignity "has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits." 
He "will not be shaken out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. . . . 
Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of." 

   Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling; one's pantry is "not unlike general's headquarters during a battle." 
If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port: "Please don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. 
You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." 
It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare: "For all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph." 
We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow. 
That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph. 

   Mr. Ishiguro's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, "An Artist of the Floating World," set in Japan after the war. 
Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster. 
With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti-Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: "It is, in practice, simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service. . . . 
`This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable. 
I will hereafter devote myself to serving him.' This is loyalty intelligently bestowed." 

   In the end, after meeting with the former housekeeper, Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk, thinking of her and of his employer, and declares "I trusted. 
I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. . . . 
I can't even say I made my own mistakes. 
Really -- one has to ask oneself -- what dignity is there in that?" 
The loyal servant has come full circle. 
What is greatness? 
What is dignity? 
We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective: The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk. 
But as "The Remains of the Day" so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity, such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art.

Chemical Issues Have Kept Devoted Admirers,
But Even They're Picking Carefully Nowadays

<TEXT>
   Chemical stocks, like the economy, are making a lot of people nervous these days, but the optimists haven't given up. 

   These stocks took a 35% clobbering in the October massacre and its aftermath. 
But despite the stock market's crash, bulls say they don't believe a serious recession lies ahead. 
Even in an economic slowdown, they contend the chemical industry would fare better than most. 
They cite widespread restructuring earlier this decade and commodity demands that now exceed supply and capacity, as well as the weaker-dollar advantage overseas. 
There's also talk of takeovers. 

   "I see nothing ahead but chemical companies raising their prices, lowering raw material costs and widening profit margins more than you can imagine," says William Lowden, a vice president of Cigna Investments Inc. 
"We're roaring bulls." 
Adds William R. Young, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., "Chemical companies outperformed other industries in the last recession." 

   Even so, analysts have cut some earnings estimates and are picking carefully. 
They favor companies that are positioned for growth even in a recession because they offer a wide variety of products, strong cash flow and healthy overseas sales. 
Mr. Young favors Imperial Chemical, Dow Chemical and Himont. 
He isn't recommending PPG Industries, Allied-Signal, Hercules or Du Pont. 

   Mr. Lowden says 4% to 8% of Cigna's portfolio is still in chemical stocks, compared with the market's weighting of 3% to 4%. 
He likes Dow Chemical because of its strong international position and sales in basic commodities such as chlorine and caustic soda. 
He forecasts earnings of $6.45 a share for 1987 and $8.45 a share for 1988, compared with $3.87 for Dow in 1986. 

   Robert S. Reitzes, an analyst at Mabon Nugent who calls himself a "closet bull," has rated companies based on several courses for the economy. 
His strategy puts a premium on international exposure, strong cash flow, low debt and a product mix that won't be affected by a recession. 
His best case anticipates 2% GNP growth in 1988; his worst case is a 2% decline. 

   Topping his list, either way, are American Cyanamid, Monsanto, International Minerals, B.F. Goodrich, Olin and Aristech. 
If the economy remains strong, he also recommends Dow, Du Pont, Himont and National Distillers. 
In a recession, he says he would avoid companies with high debt or heavy exposure to the housing and auto industries, such as Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Ethyl, Rohm &amp; Haas, PPG, W.R. Grace and Union Carbide. 
He says Hercules, Imperial Chemical and GAF Corp. also might be good "defensive buys" in an economic downturn. 

   "I may have myself out on a limb a little," Mr. Reitzes acknowledges. 
For American Cyanamid, he forecasts 1987 earnings of $2.80 a share, up from $2.18 in 1986. 
He sees 1988 earnings of $3.50 a share at best and $2.75 at worst. 
He puts Monsanto at $5.90 a share in 1987, compared with $5.55 in 1986. 
He sees 1988 earnings at $7 a share and $5.25 a share, good and bad, respectively. 
For Goodrich, he estimates $3.85 a share for 1987 compared with 48 cents in 1986. 
He estimates $6 a share and $3.75 a share under his two 1988 possibilities. 

   Du Pont, which reached a high of 131 in August because Wall Street liked its steps to improve productivity, has taken a beating. 
It closed at 84 3/8 Wednesday. 
Most analysts are concerned that fiber sales, almost 18% of total company sales, are too closely tied to the unstable economy. 
Also, they still don't see favorable earnings from Du Pont's Conoco oil and coal unit. 

   Mr. Reitzes says Du Pont earnings could increase to $7.50 a share in 1987 compared with $6.35 a share in 1986. 
In 1988, he sees Du Pont at $8.50 in a good economy, but only $5.75 in a weak one. 

   Mr. Reitzes, as do other analysts, says chemical companies are good takeover targets because of their cash flow and currently undervalued stock prices. 
Some, like Goodrich and Olin, also have units that raiders could sell off at premiums. 
Also in the takeover rumor mill are W.R. Grace and Monsanto. 
Analysts say, however, they haven't heard of serious buyers for any of these companies. 

   More bearish analysts, such as Peter Butler of First Boston and John Henry of E.F. Hutton, say they don't see chemical stocks as the place to hide in a recession. 
Mr. Butler says export prices will be "very sensitive to perceived future changes" in the economy. 
He also warns that any excess inventories aren't yet known and that drops in auto or retail sales could lead to production cuts. 

   Mr. Butler assumes zero domestic growth in 1988 and 1989 and a 1.5% growth average in Europe and Japan. 
He still recommends Du Pont, Imperial Chemical and Dow Chemical because of strong earnings expectations, management, and productivity improvements. 

   Mr. Henry also anticipates a recession, or at least a nine-month slowdown. 
He adds that the unbridled optimism of most company managers may have swayed many analysts. 
"In the last five recessions I've been through," he says, "no manager has ever forecast one coming. 
They're the last to say."

<TEXT>
   A violent white supremacist group
targeted several prominent people for assassination, including
Henry Kissinger and top television executives, a witness testified
Monday in a federal sedition trial.
   Denver Parmenter, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty in 1985 to racketeering, testified that members of
The Order planned robberies, guerrilla warfare and murders to
further their goal.
   ``Our purpose was to kill important people in government or
other important institutions in this country to create havoc,
disorder, destruction,'' Parmenter said. Order members took an oath
which included the words, ``I have no fear of death.''
   Ten of the 14 men on trial are accused of sedition, or plotting
to overthrow the government by illegal means; two are charged with
interstate transportation of stolen money; and five are charged
with conspiring to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent. Neither
the judge, the FBI agent nor any of the celebrities mentioned in
the trial Monday were harmed.
   Parmenter said he was a former member of the Church of Jesus
Christ Christian (Aryan Nations) at Hayden Lake, Idaho, which is
run by defendant Richard Butler.
   Parmenter said Butler frequently spoke of his racial and
political viewpoints in sermons. He said Butler said the U.S.
government was ``basically a government that wasn't supporting its
race.''
   Parmenter said he and eight others, including defendants David
Lane and Bruce Pierce, formed The Order in September 1983 in
Metalline Falls, Wash., home of the late Robert Mathews.
   Mathews outlined six goals for Order members, including
developing a war chest through illegal means such as robbery and
counterfeiting, Parmenter said. Each member was given a target to
kill, Parmenter said, including David Rockefeller, television
producer Norman Lear, Kissinger and the three major network TV
presidents.
   Parmenter previously outlined the assassination plots during the
1985 trial of Order members in Seattle.

   A federal judge has issued an order forbidding
Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken &amp; Biscuits to buy stock in Church's
Fried Chicken Inc. for 10 working days.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz on Tuesday issued the
preliminary injunction until after certain disclosures are made.
   Also Tuesday, Church's authorized its board to begin talks with
other potential buyers.
   The court order was another legal skirmish in an attempted buyout
of San Antonio-based Church's by A. Copeland Enterprises Inc., which
owns New Orleans-based Popeyes, which first made the offer on Oct.
25.
   Schwartz also ordered Popeyes:

   _To reveal the information on which its buyout offer was made.
Church's claims its former chief financial officer took confidential
files with him when he left to work for Popeyes owner Al Copeland.
   _To disclose the amount of money spent by Popeyes to buy and
maintain an offshore racing boat, corporate jet, helicopter, yacht,
bus and luxury car used by Copeland.
   _To stop using, at least for the time being, any confidential
Church's information it might have.
   A Church's spokesman said the company would ask the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to permanently enjoin Popeyes from pursuing
the takeover and to block the buyout on antitrust grounds.
   Peter Butler, Popeyes' New Orleans lawyer, said Schwartz would
have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on
McAtee's claim that Popeyes' offer was based on ``insider
information.''
   As for corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other
conveyances, Butler said: ``All those expenses have been treated as
legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by Mr.
Copeland and been reviewed very carefully.''

   North American Ventures Inc. said it is considering selling its Butler Service Group Inc. subsidiary and buying back as many as 3.5 million shares over the next eight months in an effort "to increase shareholder value." 

   "If Butler is sold, proceeds will be used to reduce debt and improve the company's balance sheet," a North American spokeswoman said in East Hartford, Conn. 
Butler, which recruits technical specialists and engineers for industrial companies, is expected to have revenue of more than $260 million in 1988, North American said. 
Officials added the unit is "significantly profitable." 

   North American, which owns growth and turnaround companies, acquired Butler last year when it purchased Butler International Inc. for $140 million in a transaction that included other units. 
The company has retained the investment banking firm of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan, Grenfell Inc. as adviser in the possible sale of Butler. 

   North American has approximately 26.2 million shares outstanding. 
Its stock closed yesterday at 93.75 cents, up 31.25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.

   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken to make further disclosures before it may buy
stock of Church's Fried Chicken under its $290 million hostile
buyout offer.
   Separately, Church's board of directors met in New York and
authorized management to explore alternatives to Popeyes' $8 a share
tender offer, including a possible transaction with a third party.
   San Antonio, Texas-based Church's, the nation's second-biggest
fried chicken chain, rejected Popeyes' offer as inadequate on Oct.
25, and again on Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz issued a preliminary
injunction barring Popeyes from buying Church's stock until 10
business days after it makes certain disclosures regarding its
alleged use of non-public corporate information.
   Church's has contended that its former chief financial officer,
Lewis B. Kilbourne, took confidential inside corporate information
with him when he was hired by New Orleans-based Popeyes, the
nation's No. 3 chicken chain.
   Church's also contened Popeyes financial adviser, Wasserstein,
Perrella &amp; Co., relied on that information in formulating the
takeover bid.
   Schwartz ordered Popeyes: to reveal the information on which its
buyout offer was made and to stop using, at least for now, any
confidential Church's information it might have.
   The judge also ordered Popeyes to disclose the amount of money
the company had spent to buy and maintain an offshore racing boat,
corporate jet, helicopter, yacht, bus and luxury car used by its
chairman, Al Copeland.
   On Monday, Schwartz issued a temporary restraining order
forbidding Popeyes from pursuing the buyout until similar
disclosures were made.
   A Church's spokesman said the company would appeal the judge's
refusal to grant a permanent injunction against the takeover and a
preliminary injunction on the antitrust claims.
   Peter Butler, Popeyes' New Orleans lawyer, said Schwartz would
have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on
the claim that Popeyes' offer was based on insider information.
   Regarding the corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other
conveyances, Butler said: ``All those expenses have been treated as

   The Woodworth mayor and his second cousin
are back in court, fighting this time over the cousin allegedly
selling watermelons without a license.
   Mayor David Butler brought Charlie Butler into state district
court Monday over a roadside watermelon stand Charlie Butler set up
without paying an occupational tax to the village.
   Charlie Butler's lawyer suggested the ordinance was illegal.
   Ninth Judicial District Judge Richard Lee took the matter under
advisement.
   The Butlers first appeared in court several months ago when
Charlie Butler was accused of driving Woodworth's fire truck
without authorization.
   Rapides Parish prosecutors agreed not to prosecute after Charlie
Butler signed an agreement that he would not operate the fire truck
without permission.

   The voice of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound,
Quick Draw McGraw and dozens of other cartoon characters loved by a
generation of Americans has fallen silent. Charles Dawson Butler is
dead at age 71.
   Daws Butler, as he was professionally known at Hanna-Barbera
Productions, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, the studio announced Thursday. Butler had suffered
a stroke and had been battling pneumonia in the past few months,
the studio said.
   ``I just don't know how the industry will get along without him.
There are a lot of people who can imitate Daws but he was the
original,'' said Janet Waldo, who was the voice of Judy Jetson on
``The Jetsons'' series.
   ``He was one of the most talented artists we've ever been
associated with,'' Hanna-Barbera president Joe Barbera said. ``He
was a little man, but a giant. ... Here's a man that walked into a
studio in 1957 and helped us launch this whole company.''
   Ms. Waldo met Butler on her first cartoon assignment as the
Jetsons' daughter. Butler played her brother, Elroy.
   ``I watched Daws work, and I thought this is impossible that
this one little man can come forward with all these voices,'' she
said of the 5-foot-2 Butler.
   Butler was the voice of 42 cartoon series regular characters,
among them Snagglepuss, Wally Gator, Baba Looey, Augie Doggie, Mr.
Jinks, Lippy the Lion, Snooper and Blabber, as well as hundreds of
other incidental characters.
   Among Butler's well-known lines were Yogi Bear's ``I'm smarter
than the average bear''; Snagglepuss' ``Exit, stage left''; and
Quick Draw McGraw's ``Hold on there! I'm the sheriff around here.''
   Butler also was the voice of Cap'n Crunch for the Quaker Oats
cereal company, and of many characters in Jay Ward's ``Fractured
Fairy Tales'' and ``Aesop and Son.'' Kelloggs used his voice for
Snap, one of the Rice Crispies characters.
   ``He will be terribly missed by everyone at our studio,'' said
Hanna-Barbera co-founder Bill Hanna.
   Mel Blanc, the voice of Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig
among others, regarded Butler as ``one of the great voice creators
... an extremely talented individual and very loving,'' said
Blanc's son, Mel Blanc Jr. The elder Blanc was out of town.
   Barbera said there will be a search to replace Butler.
Candidates will practice characters' lines, then give the studio an
interpretation.
   ``If we keep our fingers crossed we may be able to find the
right man. If we don't, we won't (continue the character),''
Barbera said. ``We respect them too much.''
   Butler was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up in Oak Park, Ill.
He participated in amateur contests as a young man, doing
impersonations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Rudy Vallee and a Model T
Ford starting up.
   During World War II he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve and was
married. His wife, Myrtis, was from North Carolina, and Butler
maintained that Huckleberry Hound's Southern accent came from
listening to her family and neighbors.
   Butler moved his family to California in 1945, and by 1948 was
starring in ``Time For Beany,'' the West Coast's first TV puppet
show. The show ran for five years. In 1957 he went to work for
Hanna-Barbera.
   Butler is survived by his wife and sons David, Donald, Paul and
Charles. A funeral was scheduled for Saturday at Good Shepherd
Church in Beverly Hills.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Butler Cox recommends Pounds 14m bid from
US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUTLER COX, the London-based management consulting company specialising in
information technology, is to be sold to Computer Sciences Corporation of
the US in a cash deal worth Pounds 14.3m.
CSC, a large computer systems integration company with an international
reputation for large industrial and government projects, said yesterday that
it had agreed to pay 245p per share for the entire share capital of Butler
Cox.
Following the statement shares in Butler Cox virtually doubled from 131p to
230p. The company was floated on the London stock market in May 1989 at
175p. Butler Cox directors, who between them hold 36.7 per cent of the
capital, are unanimously recommending acceptance of the offer.
Mr George Cox, managing director, said yesterday that 'the price reflects
the potential of the business.'
He said the downturn in the UK economy had hit both the level of
profitability and the share price which had made it impossible for Butler
Cox to make acquisitions using its own paper.
However, he pointed out that the company remained profitable, had grown in
cash and had avoided compulsory redundancies.
In its last financial Butler Cox experienced a 42 per cent fall in taxable
profits to Pounds 760,425 (Pounds 1.32m) on turnover up nearly 15 per cent
to Pounds 10.73m. CSC, with headquarters in Los Angeles, had net income last
year of Dollars 65m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Dollars 1.7bn.
The two companies said that Butler Cox's presence in Europe would complement
CSC's strength in North America.
Butler Cox is unique in its sector in that its conventional consultancy
activities are underpinned by a syndicated research foundation.
Members of the Butler Cox Foundation include many of the most prestigious
companies in the UK and mainland Europe, brought together by a common
concern to make the best use of information technology.
Last year Butler Cox added an education arm through the purchase of
Cranfield Information Technology Institute.
CSC announced two years ago that it intended to grow the commercial side of
its business through acquisition and had set aside a war chest of Dollars
500m for purchases world-wide.
It already owns Index, a consultancy with offices in Boston, Los Angeles,
New York and London with strong links to Harvard and to Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
The US company said its intention was to bring together Butler Cox and Index
to form a global consulting group. The two companies have a total of some
800 companies worldwide subscribing to their research programmes.

<LEADPARA>  THE Los Angeles Dodgers come to Candlestick Park in less than four weeks --
April 15, to be exact -- and Brett Butler wants Giants fans to understand one
thing: He didn't do it.;    "I didn't leave the Giants," Butler said
Wednesday. "I didn't leave; I was no longer welcome there."  </LEADPARA>

Grapefruit
League  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But, golly gee, things couldn't be better, Butler says in the next breath,
and that's Brett Butler for you. It's a wonderful life no matter where he is.
Playing center field for the Dodgers was a lifelong dream, anyway, just as it
was playing for the Giants and the Braves and, heck, maybe even the Cleveland
Indians, too.;    Butler is wearing No. 22 for the Dodgers. He could have had
No. 2, his number with the Giants, but he just couldn't take the shirt off his
manager's back. Tommy Lasorda offered, though, and the gesture, Butler said,
"made me want to hug the Italian.";    The Dodgers offered him a radio show,
too, Butler said. Again, he declined. For now, he just wants to fit in, do his
part. It's a dream come true.;    "There's something about putting on this
uniform," Butler said while dressing for Wednesday's game, a 7-5 win over
Philadelphia in which Butler singled in three trips to square his average at
.250. "I feel like I've been wearing it my whole career.";    Butler in Dodger
Blue is a strange sight. Butler in any uniform other than the one he wore last
season is strange, considering all that he meant to the Giants.;    Did you
realize that nobody in the league had more hits than Butler last season? His
192 tied Lenny Dykstra for honors. Butler batted .309, stole 51 bases, scored
108 runs. He ranked among the top five in hits, walks, runs, triples, steals,
and on-base percentage. He gave the Giants a leadoff hitter and a center
fielder for 160 games last season.;    By the way, Butler thinks Robby
Thompson can do the job. But why is it even an issue? Why isn't the Giants'
leadoff man still Brett Butler?;    Butler never thought we'd be entertaining
such questions. He thought he'd finish his career with the Giants. When he
heard Al Rosen's voice on the phone that December day, he figured the Giants'
G.M. was calling to give him a contract. Instead, Rosen gave Butler the gate.;
   "He said he was scared he was going to lose me to 'new-look' free agency,"
Butler recalled. "He said they were going to look elsewhere. My agent (Dick
Moss) called right after that and told me they'd already signed Willie
McGee.";    BUTLER is "hurt -- not bitter," and he wants Giants fans to
understand one more thing: He never asked for $15 million.;    He wanted $12
million over four years, he said, just like Vince Coleman and Steve Sax. Maybe
his agent asked for $15 million; Butler doesn't know. "Maybe there was a
conflict," Butler said. "Somehow, Al got mad.";    And the Dodgers got Butler.
They're happy to have him, and not just because he battered L.A. pitching for
a .411 average last season. The Dodgers haven't had a leadoff man since Sax
left. Now they've got Butler at the top of a lineup that includes Darryl
Strawberry, Eddie Murray, Juan Samuel and Kal Daniels.;    "Butler is the
piece that puts the puzzle together," Lasorda said.;    "He's a helluva
ballplayer . . . He's like a gnat. He upsets you, he bothers you, he annoys
you. He makes you mad.";    Soon he'll be making Giants fans mad. Coming back
to Candlestick as a member of the hated Dodgers is something Butler has
considered. It was pretty quick after he signed that he heard from a friend, a
Giants fan who "hates the Dodgers with a passion." The poor guy was already
torn.;    "He said, 'I can't boo you, so every time you come up (to bat), I'm
either gonna have to say nothing or go get a hot dog,' " Butler said.;    With
Butler batting leadoff in this lineup, the poor guy's going to eat himself
sick.  </TEXT>

JONATHAN BUTLER DID IT -- A STAR IN THE MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most amazing thing about singer-guitarist Jonathan Butler is that he isn't 
better known. With two Grammy nominations and a gold record under his belt, he 
would seem ripe for major stardom. But it still hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
The South African-born performer's appearance at the Pantages on Friday night 
underscored the fact that a good portion of the music audience is missing an 
opportunity to see a star in the making. Roving the stage with the dynamic 
energy of a young James Brown, ripping off guitar licks with the creative 
ingenuity of a George Benson, singing with the style and communication of an Al 
Jarreau, Butler gave a performance that was just about as good as a pop music 
concert can get. 
</P>
<P>
Add to the fact that he wrote most of the material he sang, and the picture of 
an artist destined for much, much bigger things came clearly into focus. 
</P>
<P>
Butler opened his set with an instrumental in which his left-handed guitar 
chording exploded with bristling, brasslike clusters. Shifting to single-note 
lines, he spun out a sequence of disjunct melodies (blended, occasionally, with 
vocal scatting) that took persistently startling twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
His singing was as good as his playing. On "I'm a Sucker for You" (from his new 
album) and "Lies" (a Grammy nomination in 1988), Butler told his stories of 
capricious desire in rhythmic bursts of high-voltage energy. Softer ballads -- 
"True Love Never Fails" and "More Than Friends" (his current single) -- were 
treated gentler and more sweetly, but without ever losing the undercurrent of 
performing passion that is intrinsic to Butler's singing. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Bofill, opening the program, sounded a bit more subdued than usual. 
Halfway through "Down the Line," however, she broke out in a soaring vocal 
improvisation that recalled how good she can be when she is at her best. 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Najee, also on the bill, displayed characteristically broad strokes 
of bright musical colors, but his finest moments came during a beautifully 
basic chorus on the standard "When Sunny Gets Blue."DON HECKMAN

   NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan alleging that
Peter E. Butler, currently a securities analyst at First
Boston Corp., violated securities laws in recommending the
stock of Memory Metals Inc. in 1985 and 1986.
   Mr. Butler, a vice president at First Boston, a unit of CS
First Boston Inc., was a vice president in the research
department of PaineWebber Inc. until about January 1987. A
First Boston spokesman said the suit pertains to Mr. Butler's
actions while at PaineWebber and that First Boston isn't a
party to it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Warren Colodner, an attorney for Mr. Butler, said, "Mr.
Butler cooperated fully in the SEC investigation and he
believes he did nothing wrong." Mr. Colodner said the SEC
began its investigation in 1986.
   PaineWebber declined comment.
   In the lawsuit, the SEC seeks a court order barring Mr.
Butler from violating securities laws. It also asks the court
to order him to turn over all the profits from the alleged
wrongdoing involving the stock of Memory Metals, which later
changed its name to Memry Corp.
   The SEC said Memory Metals had only nominal sales and
sustained losses during the period of alleged wrongdoing. The
agency alleges that Mr. Butler misled investors and committed
fraud to encourage the sale of Memory Metals securities. The
SEC also alleged that Mr. Butler had bought Memory Metals
stock for his own account and was selling his shares while
recommending that others buy.
   The SEC said that Mr. Butler made predictions as to
specific price increases and other business developments
"without a reasonable basis and while knowing, or reckless
and not knowing, that such statements were materially false
or misleading."
   The SEC also said that Mr. Butler failed to disclose
information about the risk of investing in Memory Metals and
problems at the company.
   The First Boston spokesman said the firm has been aware of
the SEC investigation for several years. "Peter Butler is an
employee in good standing," the spokesman said. "We have
reviewed the allegations in depth with both Mr. Butler and
his outside counsel. Mr. Butler denies the allegations and we
support his decision to defend himself."

   A 16-year-old boy shot a schoolmate in
the back of the head and then fatally shot himself on a bus
carrying 40 students to high school Tuesday, police said.
   Robert Butler of Clairton, a junior at Serra Catholic High
School in McKeesport, was pronounced dead at 8:40 a.m. at
McKeesport Hospital, said Police Chief Thomas Brletic.
   Adam Ference of Clairton, also a 16-year-old junior, was in
critical condition at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh, Brletic said. A hospital spokesman said the family
asked that no information be released.
   Brletic said police have no idea why the shooting occurred,
although several students noticed that Butler seemed ``moody.''
   ``We're trying to understand why this young man would bring a
gun with him on a school bus, shoot a youngster sitting in front of
him and take his own life,'' the chief said.
   Counselors were sent to the school to talk to the students.
   Brletic said Butler boarded the bus at his normal stop and
pushed past several students to get to his usual seat. Ference
boarded afterward and sat directly in front of Butler.
   During the bus ride, Butler punched the back of the seat in
front of him, prompting Ference to turn around and ask why he had
done so, Brletic said. Butler did not answer, and no further words
were exchanged, he said.
   Minutes later, when the bus was about 100 yards from school,
Butler shot Ference with a .32-caliber revolver, then put the gun
to his temple and fired, killing himself, the chief said.
   The gun belonged to Butler's father, William Butler, a former
Clairton patrolman, Brletic said.
   After the shots, the students started screaming and the bus
driver pulled into the school entrance and stopped. Students fled
the bus.
   Butler was a good student and had no history of problems at
school, Brletic said.

   A murderer scheduled for execution
Saturday has ordered a halt to his appeals after spending half his
life behind bars, saying he wants to ``get it ver with.''
   Jerome Butler, whose age is listed in prison records as 54 but
claims to be several years older, has been on death row since
November 1986 for the robbery and murder that June of a Houston
taxi driver.
   Since last month, when his first execution date was set, Butler
has refused to let lawyers file motions that could spare him from
lethal injection.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Butler said at that time.
``They could take these cuffs off me and walk me back to (death
row) and I still won't resist. There won't be no appeals.''
   Bob Walt, an assistant attorney general, said Thursday that
Butler did not appear to be backing down.
   Vic Pecorino, one of Butler's lawyers, said he had no plans to
go ahead with legal efforts to spare Butler's life against his
wishes.
   ``I think it's pretty clear and I don't think it's up to us to
go ahead'' with appeals, Pecorino said.
   Butler, convicted of shooting Nathan Oakley, has been in and out
of prison since 1959.
   Butler would be the 34th inmate executed in Texas and the 122nd
nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states
to resume use of the death penalty. The last execution in Texas was
Dec. 7.

<HEAD>Court Report: Fired Warden Ran Cockfighting Business in Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fired warden of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary operated a cockfighting business at the prison and
failed to maintain security and report escapes, the state's
corrections chief said.
   Hilton Butler, who has been on leave since August, was fired
Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged
administrative malfeasance, said Bruce Lynn, secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
   ``I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He
chose not to retire,'' Lynn told reporters Wednesday.
   Butler stepped aside as warden after a court-appointed official
issued a highly critical report of the prison's operations. But he
later filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission, claiming
that Gov. Buddy Roemer and Lynn coerced him into retiring. Butler
asked the commission to reinstate him.
   Lynn denied Butler was coerced. Roemer said he was not involved
in the details, but added that Butler ``made the right decision''
in stepping aside. The governor said Wednesday he backed Lynn's
decision to dismiss him.
   According to Lynn, the charges against Butler stemmed from an
agency probe that followed allegations leveled by the
court-appointed investigator, former warden Ross Maggio.
   Butler was replaced after U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola
received Maggio's report, which said the prison suffered from lax
management and had failed to properly search inmates and visitors
for contraband.
   Polozola ordered Maggio to investigate after a rash of escapes,
assaults and suicides at the giant prison at Angola.
   Among Maggio's report, Butler was raising fighting cocks for
sale on the prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison
facilities. Lynn said he had told all wardens to refrain from any
personal business activity on June 20, but Butler ignored the
order. Several hundred fighting cocks owned by Butler recently were
removed from the Angola grounds on Lynn's orders.
   Butler also failed to maintain searches of employees and
visitors to the prison, which ``resulted in a serious breakdown of
security,'' the report said. Drug and other contraband problems in
the prison ``were well known to the warden,'' the report said.
   Annette Viator, an agency attorney, said Butler could appeal the
decision to an internal department panel and the Civil Service
Commission. Under state regulations, Butler could still decide to
retire before the appeals process, she said.
   Butler refused to comment and referred questions to his
attorney, Floyd Falcon. Falcon said he had not received a copy of
the charges and declined comment.

Brett Butler, the San Francisco center fielder who became a free agent Friday, 
said that his agent has already been contacted by the Dodgers, whom he 
considers "my dream team." 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was a kid I wanted to play for the Dodgers," Butler said from his 
Atlanta home after becoming one of 15 new-look free agents in accordance with 
the recent collusion ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a free agent in 1987, they were my first choice. I love Los 
Angeles. It has always been a dream to play there. Hopefully something can 
transpire." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said his agent, Dick Moss, was contacted by the Dodgers Friday morning 
and that the Dodgers promised to get back to him. Butler batted .309 last year 
with 51 stolen bases and could fill the Dodgers' need for a leadoff hitter 
while allowing them to trade Kal Daniels for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outfield is a bit crowded right now, but I do expect we will speak to 
Butler," Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said. BILL PLASCHKE

he asked the judge to move up the date to Friday. The next hearing is
scheduled for Sept. 20.; TOON SIDELINED: Al Toon, the leading receiver and
offensive captain of the New York Jets, missed Sunday's season opener with
post-concussion syndrome.;   Toon had been listed as probable for the game
with Tampa Bay. His injury was listed as a contused chest. No mention ever was
made during the week that Toon had a concussion.;   The Jets scratched Toon
several hours before the game, but did not explain the injury.; JUST A WISH:
Bruce Pickens was hoping Steve DeBerg and the Kansas City Chiefs' offense
would expose some holes in the secondary of the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. He
also wanted the Falcons to win, but DeBerg threw for 158 yards and one
touchdown and Christian Okoye ran for 143 yards, leading the Chiefs to a 14-3
victory.;   Pickens was the third selection, by Atlanta, in last April's NFL
draft, and he remains the only unsigned first-round selection.  </TEXT>

   A convicted killer who had demanded
that his lawyers halt efforts to stop his execution was put to
death early Saturday for the slaying of a Houston taxi driver.
   Jerome Butler, who had spent about half of his life behind bars,
was given a lethal injection at 12:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at
12:26 a.m.
   ``I just want to say I wish everybody a good life and things
like that. Everything is okay,'' he said. He nodded to the prison
warden and to a chaplain, coughed several times and stopped
breathing.
   Butler, whose age on record was 54 although he claimed to be
several years older, was sentenced for the 1986 shooting death and
robbery of 67-year-old Nathan Oakley of Houston. He refused any
interviews from prison.
   Butler, who has passed competency tests, was the first person to
be executed willingly in Texas since Robert Streetman ordered his
attorneys to make no further efforts on his behalf. He was put to
death Jan. 7, 1988.
   Butler was the 34th inmate to be executed since Texas resumed
carrying out the death penalty in 1982. The total is the highest of
any state. Nationally, he was the 122nd person executed since a
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states to resume capital
punishment.
   State corrections officials said Butler had not filed any
appeals by Friday afternoon.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Butler said last month when
his execution date was set. ``They could take these cuffs off me
and walk me back to (death row) and I still won't resist. There
won't be no appeals.''
   One of Butler's attorneys, Vic Pecorino, had said Butler could
be spared if he had a change of heart.
   ``Without cooperation from him, what are you going to appeal?''
Pecorino said.
   Prosecutors said Butler may have killed Oakley because the cab
driver recognized Butler as the man who killed his friend, A.C.
Johnson, in 1973. Butler served 10 years of a 30-year prison term
for that slaying.
   ``This is what I've been waiting for _ for this moment _ to know
this man can not take away another wife's husband and children's
father,'' Oakley's widow, Robbie, said Friday. ``It's been a
difficult three and a half years. I wish I could be there to see
it.''
   Butler spent 27 years behind bars, beginning with a
23-to-47-year term in New York in 1959 for robbery, attempted
sexual assault and accessory to rape. He was paroled in 1972.
   The following year he was arrested for the Johnson slaying and
sentenced to 30 years for murder. He was freed in 1984.

A Normal Heights man was released Wednesday from County Jail downtown, where he 
was being held on suspicion of raping a slightly retarded 22-year-old woman who 
was reported missing Feb. 26, police said. Detective Robert Hilliker said 
charges of raping an incompetent were dropped against 26-year-old Richard 
Wallington, because the alleged victim, Lisa Louise Butler, did not want to 
prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us that she wasn't missing, and that it was her choice to go with 
(Wallington) because she was doing her own thing," Hilliker said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who police were told has the mental capacity of a 9-year-old, met 
Wallington at a downtown bus stop and went to his home in the 3000 block of 
Suncrest Drive, where she stayed all last week, said police spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
An official at a supervised home in Southeast San Diego, where Butler lives, 
reported her disappearance to police, who alerted the local media. Her picture 
appeared in some newspapers and television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliker said police interviewed Butler and determined she was capable of 
making her own decision about staying with Wallington. He said there was 
insufficient evidence of Butler's retarded mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was found Monday in a Burger King restaurant at Fashion Valley, Robinson 
said. He said that a man who had worked with Butler in a Special Olympics event 
recognized her from media reports and told an employee to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Wallington is employed at the fast-food restaurant and Butler was waiting for 
him to finish work.

$1.1-MILLION FOR JAIL ABUSE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what his attorney called one more step toward a citizens' review board, a 
$1.1-million award given to a former Navy chaplain who had been beaten in a 
Vista jail was upheld Thursday by a Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Barbara Gamer then added to the award by attaching to it more than 
$200,000 in legal fees incurred by Jim Butler, 60, in his lawsuit against the 
county and Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
David B. Florance, the attorney for the defendants, said afterward that the 
verdict would be appealed, even though Gamer had rejected the motion for a new 
trial. Gamer added that interest would be assessed to any money owed to Butler, 
pending the outcome of an appeal or a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's victory follows the $332,000 awarded Wednesday by a Superior Court 
jury to a Vista woman who complained that sheriff's deputies used excessive 
force in booking her into County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Adler, Butler's attorney, said that Wednesday's North County verdict was 
"just icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you could say Jim and his attorney are very happy," Adler said with a 
smile. "This mistake on the part of the county should finally help land a 
citizens' review board, which has been needed for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Butler has offered to give $320,000 of the $1.1 million award to offset 
start-up costs of a review board. The Board of Supervisors voted in July to 
place a measure on the November ballot that would create such a board to 
monitor the performance of sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Although outgoing Sheriff Duffy is opposed to the idea, sheriff's candidates 
Jim Roache and Jack Drown have said they support a review board. 
</P>
<P>
"Any organization needs a system of checks and balances," Butler said. "Our 
founding fathers said that about the Constitution. We have to have such a thing 
to check abuses of power. And in the past, Duffy has been responsible for a lot 
of abuses." 
</P>
<P>
Butler was jailed for less than 24 hours in January, 1985. He said the 
intervening five years of litigation triggered a heart attack, clinical 
depression and the loss of a $25,000-a-year business renovating mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Jan. 19, 1985, Butler and his cousins were in his Vista home in 
the 1600 block of Foothill Drive. They were cleaning up after dinner when they 
heard screeching brakes and dashed outside to offer assistance to accident 
victims. Until that night, Butler had no arrest record. 
</P>
<P>
According to Butler, he asked Deputy Robert Bishop to turn on his patrol car's 
flashers and move the vehicle to the hilltop, out of the way of other cars. 
Butler says the response was physical and verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was tossed into a patrol car, taken to jail and then beaten, denied 
access to badly needed medication for high blood pressure, and placed inside a 
rubber-padded cell. 
</P>
<P>
He has likened the experience to rape. 
</P>
<P>
Florance, the sheriff's attorney, has characterized Butler's behavior that 
night as intrusive, saying that Butler tried to give orders to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who once taught students in a Catholic high school and served as a 
chaplain in Vietnam, has called the ordeal worse than anything he endured in 
Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to help other people," he said. "Because I was doing that, I 
got into a confrontation. When I was in jail, I was beaten badly. I suffered a 
dislocated shoulder. They broke my nose. 
</P>
<P>
"The police like to use this term 'attitude adjustment.' I just hope they learn 
to apply the same term to their own work and forget this Rambo, shoot-em-up 
stuff forever."

<HEAD>Gun Training Planned for Would-Be Butlers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 15 aspiring butlers, drawing a gun will be as
important as drawing a bath.
   The would-be servants will be taking a three-day course on
handlng guns so they can protect employers and their families in
the United States and other overseas posts.
   ``Unfortunately, we're living in an era of violence, and wealthy
people overseas who employ butlers want somebody who in an
emergency can go to a drawer and fire a gun to protect them and
their families,'' said Ivor Spencer, who runs the International
School for Butler Administrators.
   Spencer said he was surprised that all 15 students in the
seven-week course said they wanted to learn how to handle guns and
semi-automatic weapons.
   ``I gave them the option and thought some would be afraid of
guns,'' he said.
   The three-day course in Newport, Wales, starting Nov. 9, will
include training on the use of semi-automatic weapons, he said.
   Spencer said he didn't expect butlers to be toting guns in
Britain, which has strict gun control laws and has banned
over-the-counter sales of the weapons. But he said he does expect
some butlers going overseas to get licenses and use their training.
   The school, which recently added karate to its curriculum, runs
several courses in London, one in Houston and is starting one in
Australia.
   Butlers trained by the school are now working for the Duke and
Duchess of York, Prince Edward and King Hussein of Jordan, Spencer
said.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Marbaix merges Asquith and Butler to create
single machine tool maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the oldest UK machine tool builders, Asquith and Butler, are being
merged into one company by their new owner to create a strong force in one
of the most competitive industrial product markets.
Marbaix Lapointe, the machine tool side of Marbaix (Holdings), a
family-owned Basingstoke-based concern, has combined the two companies, both
based in Halifax, to form Asquith Butler.
The Asquith site will close and the entire company will move on to the
nearby Butler site.
The merger is the culmination of a plan by Marbaix to broaden its presence
in the machine tool industry, after buying in 1987 the Lapointe broaching
machine business.
Last year Marbaix Lapointe purchased Asquith, founded in 1866 and best known
for its vertical machining centres.
Asquith had been subject to a management buy-out in 1981.
Then in February it paid a nominal amount to the publicly-quoted B Elliott
engineering group for Butler, which makes horizontal machining centres.
Butler was founded in 1868 and had been combined by B Elliott with Newall,
the Keighley-based blade-tip grinding business, which was excluded from the
sale.
Marbaix was attracted by the strength of the products and the personnel at
Asquith and Butler, but because of the recession both companies were losing
money.
'We have put together two companies that may not have survived on their
own,' said Mr Peter Cain, managing director of Marbaix Lapointe, yesterday.
The merger would produce economies of scale and better utilisation of
factory equipment.
Asquith Butler will have annual sales of Pounds 10m-Pounds 11m and about 120
employees - a large company for the machine tool industry. Mr Cain said
competition, mainly from Spain and France, was serious, but he believed
Asquith Butler would make a profit this year.

<TEXT>
   A Miami couple who survived 66 days aboard a life
raft in the Pacific Ocean returned home Saturday looking for a long
rest _ away from the water and their aquatic tormentors.
   William Butler, 59, and Simone Butler, 56, arrived at Miami
International Airport after a seven-week ordeal, during which they
said their boat was sunk by whales and they had to fend off sharks
and subsist on fresh fish and desalinated sea water.
   The couple, each more than 50 pounds lighter after the ordeal,
flew from San Jose, Costa Rica, a week after they were rescued by a
Costa Rican Coast Guard cutter 13 miles off that Central American
nation's coast.
   ``It's hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift,
trying to make landfall,'' Butler said. ``Really, it's hard to
discuss the situation.''
   Butler said the most dangerous day on the covered raft was a day
he called ``The Shootout at O.K. Corral.''
   The Butlers that afternoon found themselves in the middle of a
huge school of triggerfish, a small feeding fish. Then came a school
of porpoises and ``about 20 to 30 sharks,'' he said.
   ``They all got in a huge feeding frenzy,'' Butler said, that
ended only about 3 a.m. the next day.
   During the turbulent episode, either a porpoise or a shark got
caught in one of the raft's balast bags, and violently threw the
raft about for a couple of minutes, according to Butler.
   Butler, a retired exporter, looked trim and fit. He wore a bushy
grey beard grown during the sojourn.
   Mrs. Butler, who lost 67 pounds, left the plane in a wheelchair,
but stood up to greet waiting family members and friends and talk
with reporters.
   Among those waiting to meet the Butlers was their 2-month-old
granddaughter, Jessica Butler, who was born after they put to sea.
   The couple was hospitalized in Costa Rica after the rescue.
   ``The first night in the hospital,'' said Mrs. Butler, a native
of France, ``I had a terrible nightmare, and didn't know where I
was. It was a terrible two minutes in the dark before I realized
that I was on land and it was all right.''
   On May 24, the Butlers began a voyage from Panama to Hawaii in
their 40-foot sailboat.
   Nearly three weeks out, whales, apparently seeking to protect
their young, attacked and sank the boat, the couple said.
   `I don't know anything about whale psychology,'' Butler said,
``but I assume we headed into (the whales') pack. The babies were in
front, the mothers behind, then the males.''
   Butler said the male whales attacked the boat, ramming its hull
while making loud chugging sounds ``like a locomotive.'' The couple
sent help signals, grabbed essentials and jumped into the raft as
the craft went down in minutes.
   They managed to escape with six cans of food _ including half a
jar of peanut butter _ the ship's log, a puncture repair kit for the
rubber raft and the crucial fishing line and a portable desalination
filter.
   The canned food held out for 20 days, then they lived on fish
they caught.
   The couple said they sighted dozens of ships during their ordeal,
but weren't seen by the crews.
   The Costa Rican Coast Guard spotted the couple floating in their
life raft Aug. 19.
   ``We're going to rest _ and go away from the ocean for a while,
to the mountains, the prairies,'' Butler said.
   The life-long sailor said he plans to resume sailing ``in about a
year.''
   They said they have received various offers for rights to the
story of their ordeal.
   ``We've already received a lot of offers,'' Butler said. ``Offers
for movie rights, for TV rights, for book rights, for
ghostwriters.'' But ``we've put that all on hold,'' his wife said.

<TEXT>
   The ex-warden of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary was fired for lax security, not reporting escapes and
operating a cockfighting business at the prison, the state's
corrections chief said Wednesday.
   Hilton Butler, who has been on leave since in August, was fired
Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged
administrative malfeasance, said Bruce Lynn, secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
   ``I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He
chose not to retire,'' Lynn said.
   Butler, a career corrections employee, stepped aside as warden
after a court-appointed investigator, former Angola warden Ross
Maggio, issued a highly critical report on operations at the vast
prison complex at Angola.
   Butler later asked the Civil Service Commission to reinstate
him, claiming that Gov. Buddy Roemer and Lynn coerced him into
retiring.
   Lynn has denied that Butler was coerced. Roemer said he was not
involved in the details, but added that Butler ``made the right
decision'' to step aside. The governor said Wednesday that he
backed Lynn's decision to dismiss Butler.
   Butler can appeal his firing to an internal department panel and
to the Civil Service Commission.
   Butler refused comment and referred questions to his attorney,
Floyd Falcon. Falcon said he had not received a copy of the charges
and declined comment.
   According to the charges, Butler was raising fighting cocks for
sale on prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison utilities.
Several hundred fighting cocks he owned have been removed from
Angola grounds on Lynn's orders.
   The charges said he also failed to maintain searches of
employees and visitors to the prison, allowed inadequate and
inoperable security equipment, ill-trained personnel, and failed to
report at least seven escapes for prosecution, as required by
agency policy.
   Lynn said the charges were referred to the district attorney who
handles Angola and a copy would be sent to U.S. District Judge
Frank Polozola, who is overseeing a long-running federal suit
involving the prison system.

   After years of preaching racism and
hatred, the Rev. Richard Butler has lost some of his fire and
brimstone.
   At 71, he walks slowly and breathes with difficulty, still weak
from a heart attack suffered two years ago while awaiting trial on
charges of scheming to overthrow the U.S. government.
   Many followers of his white supremacist Aryan Nations church
have been jailed, or scared off by FBI investigations and publicity
from civil rights organizations.
   But this aging ``Aryan warrior'' hangs onto his dream of an
all-white homeland in the Pacific Northwest, seeking inspiration
from an unlikely source _ skinheads.
   ``They're the last hope, the only hope, of the white race,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Where others see menacing young thugs who shave their heads and
tattoo their bodies with swastikas, Butler sees the next
torch-bearers of racism. Butler is sponsoring the first national
neo-Nazi skinhead conference here this weekend to mark the 100th
birthday of Adolf Hitler, on April 20.
   The meeting worries law officers and rights activists, who until
recently were noting with satisfaction that membership in racist
hate groups seemed to be declining nationwide.
   ``Now, with skinheads, you have a pool of violence-prone,
ideologically sympathetic people who are being courted to join the
mainstream of the right-wing movement,'' said Marvin Stern,
northwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith.
   The Jewish group notes that many skinheads band together without
racist motivation. Those who can be classified as neo-Nazis,
however, number about 2,000 in 21 states, with the greatest
concentrations in Southern California and the Northwest, Stern said.
   In Portland, Ore., skinheads are awaiting trial in the death
last November of an Ethiopian man, who was fatally beaten with a
baseball bat. Another skinhead is accused of stabbing a black man
in Spokane, Wash. Swastikas painted on synagogues and assaults on
Jews, homosexuals and other minorities have additionally been
linked to skinheads in the region.
   Butler is not alone in courting skinheads. He's competing with
groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, led
by Tom Metzger in Fallbrook, Calif.
   ``Until now, skinhead groups have been mostly autonomous and
localized,'' Stern said. ``Any network Butler puts together bears
watching.''
   The network-building was visible last week as Butler and his
followers prepared for this weekend's conference at his northern
Idaho compound, 20 wooded acres tucked away on a gravel road near
the resort town of Hayden Lake.
   Two men hammered away in one of several rustic guest cabins. A
barefoot young woman leaned over a long canvas banner, stenciling
in ``Aryan Nations Now.''
   Taking time for an interview in the compound's modest church,
Butler resembled not at all the tough, urban youths he is wooing.
Dressed in a sweater vest, wool slacks and loafers, the
gray-haired, bi-focaled Butler played the part of a kindly country
preacher.
   Butler shrouds his racist message in religion, using scripture
to support his claims of white supremacy. He conceded that Biblical
quotations may turn off skinheads, not known for steady church
attendance.
   Many skinheads listen to the racist lyrics of Skrewdriver, an
industrial-grade British rock band. Butler wishes they would listen
to Beethoven.
   ``We want them to be able to think,'' he said. ``You can't think
if you're listening to the hard-rock jungle beat.''
   Despite the generation gap, Butler feels he offers something
these alienated youths can understand: a call to power in the name
of racial pride.
   ``The white male, through affirmative action, has been made a
non-citizen,'' he said. ``This is why you have skinheads. They're
beginning to wake up to the fact that they've been conquered and
that the land their fathers bled and died for has been taken away.''
   His little church in the pines has a guard tower that's higher
than the steeple. Inside, sunlight filters through stained glass
onto a huge Nazi flag. A poster showing a young man with an assault
rifle exhorts, ``Join Us, Aryan Freedom Fighters.''
   ``Kids like that kind of stuff _ it gives the idea that they're
in battle,'' Butler said, quickly adding that talk of battle was
only talk.
   Butler moved to Idaho in 1973 and over the years built up a
following based on his dream of a ``territorial imperative'' for
whites. He considered the Northwest an ideal homeland: rural,
conservative and lacking many blacks, Jews and other minorities.
   His dream was blocked not only by resistance from local
authorities but also by the violence of his own followers.
   Some former members, impatient with waiting for revolution,
formed a group known as The Order. The group's founder, Robert
Mathews, died in a fiery shootout with FBI agents in 1984 on an
island in Washington's Puget Sound. Ten Order members have been
convicted of racketeering, and 12 more pleaded guilty to various
crimes in a scheme that included murder, armored-car robberies and
plots to overthrow the U.S. government.
   Two years ago, Butler and 14 other white supremacists were
charged with plotting to overthrow the government. They were
acquitted last April, but Butler's arrest and the costly trial
crippled his already-weakened organization.
   Butler said weekly church attendance, which once peaked at 60,
now hovers around 40. Outside observers put the number even lower.
An Aryan Nations computer billboard, once touted as a high-tech
communications network for white supremacists, was discontinued
after the computer was stolen, Butler said.
   But just when his opponents figured he was washed up, Butler
announced plans for this weekend's skinhead conference. At first,
officials expected up to 250 skinheads, and Butler promised a march
down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene.
   In the face of fierce opposition from locals, Butler backed off.
He said he didn't want his supporters catching AIDS from
counter-demonstrators. And now he says he's expecting just 75 to
100 skinheads.
   He's planning a weekend of lectures, karate workshops and
campfire ``fellowship.'' He said lawyers will offer the skinheads
tips on how to build power legally.
   ``I hope to keep them from going to prison or getting killed.
They can do a lot more for the cause on the streets,'' Butler said.
``I want them to become a political force. That can come when they
have knowledge. When you have knowledge, you have power.''
   The idea of a white homeland in the Northwest is little more
than rhetoric bandied about by ideologues doomed by their own
extremism and violence, said Norman Gissel, president of the
Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations. The group is among
several planning civil rights activities this week to counter the
skinhead gathering.
   ``These people are their own worst enemies,'' Gissel said. ``Now
they're down to a church that has about 10 members and a handful of
kids.''
   But Butler warns against writing off the racist cause.
   ``The old men like myself are going to die off very soon,'' he
said. ``But this is the first time that I've seen a spirit of
regeneration.''

<HL> Sunstar Inc. to Buy John O. Butler Co. For $161 Million </HL>

<TEXT>
   Japan-based Sunstar Inc. agreed to acquire John O. Butler Co. for nearly $161 million in a transaction initiated by an affiliate of Sunstar's advertising agency. 

   The Japanese consumer-products concern's agreement in principle to acquire the Chicago-based maker of toothbrushes is the biggest transaction yet for PaineWebber/Young &amp; Rubicam Ventures Inc. 
A joint venture of the brokerage company, PaineWebber Group Inc., and ad agency Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., the company was formed in late 1986 to structure mergers and acquisitions for consumer-products companies. 

   At the time, the concerns said the venture was based on the idea that companies should restructure with their brands and customers in mind. 

   Edward N. Ney, the former Young &amp; Rubicam chairman who is the joint venture's chairman, said PaineWebber/ Young &amp; Rubicam brought Sunstar and Butler together as an adviser to Sunstar, which is a Young &amp; Rubicam client in Japan. 
He said the transaction would give Sunstar, which specializes in health and beauty-aid products, instant access to the U.S. market. 

   The transaction could also broaden Butler's international markets. 
Though it makes other oral-hygiene products, Butler's most important product is the Butler G-U-M toothbrush, sold largely to dentists. 
A spokesman said the toothbrush has 25% of that market and about 7% to 8% of the retail market. 

   In New York, Yoshi Saegusa, chief representative for Sunstar in the U.S., said the acquisition would improve his company's marketing capabilities in the U.S., Japan and Europe. 

   Butler said that under the agreement, the family of the company's chairman, E.B. Tarrson, would sell its combined 72% stake for $25 a share, and the remaining 1.8 million shares would be acquired from other stockholders for the same price. 

   Industry analysts viewed the offer as a generous one, made possible by the strength of the Japanese yen in relation to the dollar. 
The per-share purchase price is nearly 35 times last year's earnings and 28 times one analyst's projected earnings for the current fiscal year. 

   In yesterday's national over-the-counter trading, Butler shares surged $10 to $23.10. 

   "I certainly don't think Sunstar is underpaying for this acquisition by any stretch of the imagination," said Harry E. Blount, analyst at Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc., in Milwaukee. 
Mr. Blount, who projects Butler's fiscal 1988 earnings at $5.7 million, or 89 cents a share, said his most optimistic per-share valuation of the company had been in the low 20s. 

   In the year ended Aug. 31, Butler earned $4.7 million, or 72 cents a share, on sales of $43.5 million. 

   The offer is subject to receipt of a fairness opinion from Butler's financial adviser and execution of a definitive merger agreement.

<TEXT>
   A Florida man said today that he and
his wife survived 66 days at sea on raw fish and purified water
after whales rammed and sank their pleasure boat off the Central
American coast.
   William Butler, 59, and his 56-year-old wife, Simone, of Miami,
were taken to a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued
by a Costa Rican coast guard crew Saturday about 20 miles off that
city's Pacific coast, Butler said.
   The Butlers were sailing their 40-foot boat, the Siboney, from
Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, Hawaii, for a vacation,
according to U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Egbert Vallecillo.
   They left Panama to start the Pacific leg of their journey on May
24, Butler said in an interview, today.
   On June 15, a group of whales attacked the boat, he said.
   ``In no more than 15 minutes, our boat was destroyed,'' he said
by telephone from the hospital. ``But God, always present in our
prayers, helped us because we carried a life raft and we got in it
immediately, taking all the things we would need.''
   He said they had eight cans of food, some cookies, a water
purifier and a fishing hook.
   ``But after 20 days adrift, all the food was gone. After that, we
started fishing. Thanks to God, we were lucky, and all the time we
had food and with the filter, we drank good water.''
   Butler shed 49 of his 175 pounds, and his wife went from 150
pounds to 92, he said, he said.
   ``They are weak, but they are expected to recover,'' said
Vallecillo, who spoke to Butler by telephone from the U.S. Coast
Guard's Pacific Command headquarters in Alameda, 10 miles east of
San Francisco.
   Butler told Coast Guard officials their boat was attacked and
sunk by ``several'' whales about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
   ``They were large, according to Mr. Butler; but he didn't know
how many whales,'' Vallecillo said.
   Butler told Coast Guard officials he is an experienced sailor.
   Vallecillo said he has heard of boats running into marine mammals
when visibility is poor, but he wasn't sure if there have been any
recorded cases of whale aggression.
   The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to
their daughter, Susan Smith, in Miami.
   ``This is an execeptional case, in that they were prepared with
fishing equipment and the desalinization unit,'' Vallecillo said.
   During the two months adrift, the lifeboat moved slowly eastward.
The Butlers caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived
multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit,
Vallecillo said.
   Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times they
spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
   On Saturday, the Costa Rican ship finally saw the raft and
rescued the couple.

<HEAD>Texas Inmate Put To Death After Stopping His Appeals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jerome Butler, who ordered his lawyers
to stop their appeals and told fellow inmates he would wait for
them in hell, was executed early today for the 1986 murder of a
taxi driver.
   Butler appeared relaxed as witnesses filed into the death
chamber. ``I just want to say I wish everybody a good life and
things like that,'' he said. ``Everything is OK.''
   Then he nodded to the prison warden and a chaplain standing
nearby, coughed several times and stopped breathing. He was
pronounced dead at 12:26 a.m. CDT, 11 minutes after a lethal
injection was administered.
   ``This is what I've been waiting for _ for this moment _ to know
this man cannot take away another wife's husband and children's
father,'' Robbie Oakley, the widow of slain cab driver Nathan
Oakley of Houston, said Friday.
   ``We feel pretty badly about this,'' Vic Pecorino, one of
Butler's attorneys, said before the execution. ``Jerome Butler is
not your typical mad-dog killer.
   ``Without cooperation from him, what are you going to appeal?''
   An inmate whose cell is near Butler's on the Texas Death Row
said Butler had been prepared to die for weeks.
   ``He said he doesn't want to be among the walking dead,'' said
Raymond Carl Kinnamon. ``He's happy as a lark on Easter Sunday. But
he's definitely said he's going to hell. He said, `I'll wait for
you in hell.'''
   Attorney General Jim Mattox, who witnessed the execution, said
prison officials offered Butler, 54, a last chance to seek a stay.
   ``He .. indicated he wanted to go on forward,'' Mattox said.
``He had indicated he simply did not want to live in prison and get
out a very old man if he would not be executed.''
   Prosecutors said Butler may have shot to death Oakley, 67, in
June 1986, because the driver recognized Butler as the man who
killed his friend, A.C. Johnson, in 1973. Butler served 10 years of
a 30-year prison term for that slaying.
   Altogether, he spent 27 years behind bars, beginning with 13
years at Sing Sing Prison in New York beginning in 1959 for
robbery, attempted sexual assault and accessory to rape.
   
   The year after his release he was arrested for the Johnson
slaying and sentenced to 30 years. He got out of prison in 1984.
Two years later, he was on death row.
   Butler had passed competency tests, so appeals on psychological
grounds could not be raised.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' he said last month when his
execution date was set.
   He told attorneys that even if he won a new trial and received a
life sentence, he would be well into his 70's before he would
become eligible for parole.
   ``What am I supposed to do then? Go live under a bridge?'' he
asked.
   Butler became the 34th inmate, and the oldest, to be executed in
Texas since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982. The total
is the highest of any state.
   He was the 122nd inmate executed in the United States since the
Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume the death penalty.

<HEAD>Naval Research Turns Sewer Gas Into Diamonds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ancient alchemists, who strived to convert
base metals into gold, have been outdone. A modern-day chemist is
changing sewer gas into diamonds.
   Dr. James E. Butler and his colleagues at the Naval Research
Laboratory won't likely be going into the fancy jewelry business,
he admits.
   But they have found a way to produce some tiny industrial-type
diamond crystals using one of the most widely available raw
materials, the methane from sewer gas.
   In this case, gas from Washington's Blue Plains Waste Water
Treatment Plant, which is adjacent to the research laboratory.
   In addition, other chemists working at the Naval Research
Laboratory have grown diamond crystals using an oxygen-acetylene
torch, Butler said.
   ``I don't think we'll be able to grow gemstone size and quality
diamonds in the near future,'' Butler cautioned.
   But the tiny diamonds made in his process _ using chemical
vapors to deposit crystals on a surface _ could have a variety of
industrial applications from abrasives to protective coatings,
computer insulators and a host of other uses, he said.
   What Butler and the other Navy scientists are doing is
developing methods of getting carbon to form diamond crystals.
Their process requires heating chemical vapors at normal air
pressure or less and then getting carbon from the vapor to
crystalize on a surface at temperatures of about 900 degrees
Celsius (1,440 degrees Fahrenheit). Current industrial processes
for making diamonds require much higher heat and pressure.
   Graphite _ the soft black material used in pencil leads _ is the
normally stable form of carbon at room temperature, Butler
explained.
   But by heating carbon-containing gases like sewer gas or
acetylene the harder form of carbon can be made to grow on a
surface. And if enough crystals form they combine into a thin
diamond film, Butler added.
   Why use sewer gas?
   ``Sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient, inexpensive
source of methane,'' Butler said. Methane, a combination of carbon
and hydrogen, is a primary constituent of sewer gas. It is
generally burned as waste.
   Researchers in other countries have performed some similar
experiments, Butler said, adding that such sources of carbon as
vodka also have been used.
   It will be years before the diamond-making system could be
developed on an industrial scale, he said, but when that happens
plenty of raw material will be available.
   And if burning of the waste gas is halted that also would reduce
pollution and release of carbon dioxide, a product of the burning
which scientsts fear will add to the so-called greenhouse warming
of the Earth.

   ``Flashpoint'' (GRP Records) _ Tom Scott
   
   Saxophonist Tom Scott has played, it seems, with everybody.
   A short list of those he's backed includes Barbra Streisand,
Steely Dan, Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell. He has written scores
for movies and even the themes for two 1970s TV shows, ``Starsky and
Hutch'' and ``The Streets of San Francisco.''
   In between such projects, Scott, sometimes with his ever-changing
band the L.A. Express, has found time to make solo records of
lightweight jazz-rock fusion, meticulously produced and somewhat
devoid of any spark.
   The same holds true for ``Flashpoint.''
   The opening cut, ``Get a Grip,'' sets the tone for the album,
with its uptempo melody, overdubbed saxophone solos and shifty
rhythm. Scott's penchant for overdubbing tenor and alto saxes
creates a fuller sound but prevents him from straying too far from
the melody, robbing his solos of spontaneity.
   ``Lost in Love'' and ``Night Drifter'' are both moodier, slower
pieces that showcase Scott's tenor sax runs, while the title cut is
the most adventurous, with its synthesizer-saxophone harmony and
machine-like rhythm.
   Scott is a talented composer, producer and sideman, but as a solo
act he shows little imagination. His music, while pleasant enough,
begs for something to set it apart from the crowd.

   ``T-Shirt'' (Epic) _ The Crickets
   
   The first album in years by The Crickets is an unexpected little
pleasure, especially if it is approached without lofty expectations.
   Former Buddy Holly sidekicks J.I. Allison and Joe Mauldin are
joined on ``T-Shirt'' by singer-guitarist Gordon Payne for 10 songs
that, happily, don't lapse into sentimental reminiscences or futile
attempts to recreate the late rocker's magic.
   They do a good job playing breezy, good-time rock 'n' roll, the
sort of thing Holly might be doing today had he lived (and stopped
progressing musically) past 1959.
   It's unpretentious, fun and instantly likeable.
   One song rises above the rest _ the Paul McCartney-produced title
cut. It's the most overtly Holly-esque song here, with an
irresistible hand-clapping, guitar-strumming chorus: ``Don't tell me
that love hurts-I read the book, I saw the movie, got the T-shirt.''
   The Crickets also poke fun at themselves in the bouncy ``Three
Piece,'' noting how many musicians have been in and out of the band
since Holly split from the group shortly before his death.
   There have been, they sing, ``more Crickets than a dog's got
fleas, but we've cut it down to a three-piece.'' Then, noting the
advantages of a smaller group, ``The overhead's down and the money's
increased.''
   Such high points are not sustained over the entire album, though,
and the sappy ballad ``The Weekend'' and the unnecessary car song
``Cruise in It'' threaten to drag things down.
   But The Crickets make up in spirit for the few weak spots, making
``T-Shirt'' a well-fitting, comfortable record.

   ``More Than Friends'' (Jive) _ Jonathan Butler
   
   Jonathan Butler is the kind of guy we all used to hate in school.
Butler is handsome, sings well, plays a mean guitar and writes
catchy songs. He probably played on the football team, too.
   Butler puts his musical talents to good use on ``More Than
Friends,'' a collection of 10 tunes that contains few clinkers. The
record is mostly pop, part r&amp;b and a little bit of jazz. Because of
Butler's scat singing and the way he rips through acoustic guitar
licks, his sound is a bit reminiscent of George Benson.
   The opening cuts, ``There's One Born Every Minute (I'm a Sucker
for You)'' and ``Breaking Away,'' both swing and swagger with a
smile. The mood remains upbeat the rest of the way, with other
highlights including the instrumentals ``Take Me Home'' and
``Sekona.'' Butler even turns a few neat phrases, as seen on ``She's
a Teaser'':
   ``She'll call you up at 2 a.m., says she wants some company; I
tell you this from experience, the only thing you'll do all night is
watch TV.''
   It's some consolation that Butler occasionally has trouble with
girls.

<HEAD>$6.3 Million High School Donation To Provide Scholarship Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A family whose bean farm on the edge
of the Everglades was sold for nearly $23 million donated about a
third of the cash to a high school scholarship fund.
   ``I can't think of anything more important than getting the kids
an education. We just have to educate our kids properly,'' said Jack
Butler during a brief ceremony Friday at which he presented the $6.4
million endowment to Deerfield Beach High School.
   The school was singled out to receive a third of the income from
the sale of the land in the wills of Butler's aunt and uncle, James
and Alice Butler, pioneer farmers who came to South Florida in 1910.
   James Butler died in 1965. Mrs. Butler, who died in 1976,
believed the sale of the 400-acre farm would reap about $250,000.
   But rapid growth in South Florida has inflated land prices in the
area about 12 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale. American National
Development Corp. of Coral Springs acquired the property June 22 and
plans to build home subdivisions.
   ``We knew the property was worth a lot more than Aunt Alice
thought,'' said Butler, 72, who farmed the land until 1985. ``We
just wanted to farm it, pay the bills and keep it free and clear
from debt until the time was right.''
   Butler said the 1,600-student school also will receive a third of
some other farm assets still to be sold.
   School officials knew of the will's provisions for years, but
were stunned by the amount of the gift.
   Principal Ronald Clodfelter said many students who might not have
considered college could now do so with grants from the fund. He
said the school will form a scholarship committee to oversee the
funds and determine how they will be allocated.
   Under present rates, the yearly interest from the endowment would
be more than $500,000, said David Moyar, a vice president at
Southeast Bank, which is handling the funds.
   ``Alice and James wanted to do a lot for the high school,'' said
George Patterson, an attorney for the Butlers' estate. ``She was
adamant about the school.''

<LEADPARA>  After 40 games this season, the Giants had the worst record in the club's
109-year history. They were a shocking 12-28.;    About 40 games later, it is
time for a little more humility. The National League All-Star reserves were
announced Thursday, and there was Brett Butler in center field.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Not Willie McGee, but Butler. Not the four-time All-Star, but the one who
never had been invited. Not the Giants' new center fielder, but the one he was
signed to replace.;    Butler certainly was not the most unexpected of the Los
Angeles Dodgers' representatives for Tuesday's game in Toronto. Teammate Eddie
Murray was chosen as Will Clark's backup at first base, and fans in San Diego
have to be justifiably angered that Fred McGriff was snubbed.;    In Butler's
case, it is merely another slap in the Giants' face. Just when they had gotten
over that dubious 40-game start, this further defines their season.;    Giants
General Manager Al Rosen chose not to negotiate with Butler over the past
winter. Butler was going to be a new-look free agent, and Rosen has said
Butler was going to seek Clark-type contract numbers. Butler has said he might
have been able to come to an agreement, and that he was not given the
opportunity.;    Butler was allowed to seek employment elsewhere, and the
Giants signed McGee in the meantime for four years and $13 million. McGee
could do more things, they figured, and besides, Robby Thompson could handle
Butler's old leadoff job.;    Through Wednesday, Thompson had hit .226 at
leadoff, .244 at No. 2, .283 at No. 6 and .281 at No. 7. Mike Felder is the
leadoff man now. The Giants' offense has not been the same since Butler left,
and one can only wonder if his absence is the reason.;    "They obviously
wanted McGee, and they got him," Butler said during the Giants' recent visit
to Dodger Stadium. "That's fine. He has done well, and I've done well here.
I'm not going to say the Giants have struggled because they let me go. I've
said all along it's their pitching.";    Because Kevin Mitchell missed so much
time, McGee was the Giants' only legitimate candidate to join Clark at the
All-Star Game. Besides Butler, McGee was the only other legitimate candidate
in the league from center field, a rather weak position this season. Fans had
given neither McGee nor Butler much support, and McGee was bypassed when N.L.
Manager Lou Piniella and N.L. President Bill White chose reserves and
pitchers. Even Cincinnati's Paul O'Neill made it ahead of McGee.;    "I don't
put too much emphasis on it," said McGee, who has been to four All-Star Games
but none since 1988. He has averaged around .320 and made only three errors in
a new and windy home park, but he said last weekend that he was more deserving
last year, when he won a batting title.;    Butler broke into the majors at
about the same time as McGee, in the early '80s, and this was his first
selection to an All-Star team despite being considered the best leadoff man
this side of Rickey Henderson. That should make it even harder for the Giants
to swallow. As for Butler, there has been no desire to rub it in. He said he
and Rosen have not talked since parting company ("We waved to each other"
during a series this season at Candlestick Park, Butler said), but he did chat
briefly with Giants Manager Roger Craig before the teams last played.;    For
Butler, this has been a typical season. He led the league with 56 runs through
Wednesday and was hitting .296. The difference is, he is on a division leader
and is being widely credited as the catalyst of the Dodgers' rise.;    Within
the Giants' clubhouse, there surely are old friends who wish Butler well. But
watching him on television Tuesday night will be just another humbling fact,
right up there with the 40-game start.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   This quiet resort town may have been
slow to recognize the racist threat of Richard Butler's neo-Nazi
sect, but civil rights leaders say their vigilance is now wide-eyed
and alert.
   Butler targeted the Northwest for an all-white Aryan Nations
homeland partly because of the region's conservative politics and
tradition of tolerance.
   ``The Aryan Nations miscalculated,'' said Tony Stewart,
president of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment.
``They did not find acceptance in the Northwest.''
   This week, as Butler prepares for a neo-Nazi skinhead conference
at his compound a few miles from Coeur d'Alene, civic leaders in
northern Idaho are planning a march, a picnic and an inter-faith
church service to celebrate cultural diversity.
   Butler's activities did not always provoke such responses. His
Aryan Nations church, established in 1973, was all but ignored for
years.
   ``You have a lot of kooks and nuts anywhere you go,'' said
Norman Gissel, president of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human
Relations. ``In north Idaho, especially, the sentiment is that you
leave your neighbor alone if he wants to be left alone.''
   That started to change in 1981, when swastikas appeared on a
Jewish-owned restaurant in Hayden Lake. The task force was formed,
but community participation remained low until 1985, when court
trials revealed ties between Butler's Aryan Nations and The Order,
a violent group that masterminded murder, bombings and armed bank
robberies.
   Coeur d'Alene's live-and-let-live demeanor changed forever the
morning of Sept. 29, 1986, when three bombs exploded in town,
planted by white supremacists as a diversion during a foiled bank
robbery.
   The next summer, when Butler held his annual Aryan World
Congress for about 200 white supremacist leaders, a civil rights
rally in Coeur d'Alene drew 1,000 people.
   The task force on human relations has served as a model for
about a dozen watchdog groups now operating in the Northwest,
Gissel said. The coalition Stewart heads is another offshoot,
monitoring hate crimes throughout the region.
   State lawmakers have also joined the fight against racism.
   ``Idaho now has the most comprehensive anti-hate crime
legislative package in the United States,'' said Stewart.
   Idaho is one of 18 states, and the only one in the Northwest,
with laws against paramilitary training. A ``malicious harassment''
law makes it a felony to assault someone on the basis of race,
religion or ethnic background. And that law will be strengthened by
another measure passed last month. It calls for an annual report on
hate crimes and requires law officers investigating any crime to
note whether harassment was involved.
   Civil rights leaders are confident the white supremacists will
never find their ``promised land'' in the Northwest. But they do
not plan to relax their vigilance.
   ``As long as they exist in any organized form, there is going to
be harassment to people of color, Jews and other minority groups,''
Gissel said. ``We're going to do whatever we can to hasten the day
when those types of activities cease to occur.''

<HEAD>Judge Releases Older Couple Who Robbed Bank to Pay Mortgage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has freed an older couple who robbed a bank
at gunpoint because they couldn't afford their mortgage payments.
   Herbert Butler, 65, and his wife Eleni, 61, admitted holding up a
London bank last New Year's Eve in an effort to meet mortgage
payments of $2,140 a month. They receive a monthly pension of $41.
   In Friday's decision, Judge Raymond Dean in Old Bailey Court gave
the Butlers a two-year suspended sentence and let them go.
   ``You are both of retirement age and must have been quite
desparate to embark on that course of action,'' he said.
   The judge said he was convinced Butler did not intend to use the
gun he carried during the robbery and that they would not rob again.
   The Butlers wore ski masks and wigs during the robbery. When they
demanded money, the teller reportedly said, ``Don't be silly.''
   But Butler brandished his gun, and the teller handed over nearly
$3,800 in cash.
   The couple fled in a vehicle, but police arrested them at a
traffic light.
   According to court testimony, Butler told the officers: ``All
right, all right, you have caught us. But take it easy on her, she
has heart trouble.''
   The couple left court without comment Friday. Their lawyer said
they ``are delighted with the result and just want to start a new
life,'' according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Nicholson gets its Butler - Legal
Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, a medium-sized City law firm has appointed Mr Jim
Butler, former senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, as a non-executive
member of its partnership board. Mr Butler is chairman of European Passenger
Services and a non-executive director of British Rail, Tomkins, the
conglomerate, and Camelot, the consortium put together to run the UK
National Lottery. His role at Nicholson will be to advise on management
issues and act in an ambassadorial capacity.
Mr Michael Johns, Nicholson's managing partner said the firm was looking for
a non-executive with a professional services background to take an objective
look at the partnership. By appointing Mr Butler the firm was 'trying to say
we're ambitious, that we want to be seen to be different and that we are
flexible', he said.
Nicholson is not the first firm to take on outsiders in a non-executive
capacity. Freshfields has two non-executive members of its partnership
board. Mischon de Reya also has a non-executive chairman. But Nicholson is
the first medium-sized City firm to take-on a non-executive and Mr Johns
believes Mr Butler's appointment could spark a trend. Management is an issue
for all law firms at the moment, he says.

   Butler Manufacturing Co. said its board authorized it to buy back as many as 600,000, or 12%, of its common shares outstanding, in the open market and in private transactions. 

   The supplier of building systems and construction services, which has about five million shares outstanding, said the shares will cost about $18 million. 
The buyback is aimed at improving the value of the shares, Butler said. 

   Most of the cash required for the repurchases will come from the business units and assets being sold as a part of a previously announced restructuring. 
The remaining cash will come from operations, Butler said.

<HEAD>Butler Found Innocent In Stolen Paintings Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The butler didn't do it, ruled 12 jurors who
deliberated the fate of a man accused by his wealthy ex-employer of
stealing two paintings worth more than $500,000.
   Rune Gunnar ``Roy'' Donnell, a Swedish butler who had been
jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail since his arrest last September,
was freed Friday after a jury found him innocent of two counts of
grand theft.
   ``In other words, the butler didn't do it,'' said Donnell's
attorney, Donald C. Randolph.
   Donnell, 62, had worked for Elizabeth Keck for 15 years, but
quit about three months before she discovered a 19th-century
English painting missing from her Bel-Air home.
   The impressionist work ``I Fria Luften,'' by Swedish-born artist
Anders Zorn, was reported missing last September. A French work,
``Fete Gallante,'' also was missing.
   The paintings were sold to a Stockholm, Sweden, firm that paid
$500,000 for ``I Fria Luften,'' and $5,000 for ``Fete Gallante.''
   Donnell testified that he received permission to act as Mrs.
Keck's agent in selling the paintings in Stockholm.
   Mrs. Keck denied Donnell's story and told police Donnell often
admired the Zorn painting and said it would fetch a high price in
Sweden.
   ``Suffice it to say that we feel that the jury was misled by the
defense,'' said Mrs. Keck's attorney, Steven Knowles. He said she
was considering filing a civil suit.
   Mrs. Keck is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art and her
husband, Howard B. Keck, is a retired oilman who has been listed by
Forbes Magazine as one the country's 400 richest people.
