<LEADPARA>  KEVIN Costner's Robin Hood might as well hang up his quiver and bow. Thelma
Dickinson and Louise Sawyer, from Nowheresville, Ark., have gotten the drop on
him as the summer's first honest-to-gosh folk heroes.;    The unlikely
fugitives, played to a fare-thee-well by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, ride
a wave of violence and dumb luck to become the objects of a three-state police
chase in "Thelma &amp; Louise" (opening today).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     En route to their place as cinema legends, these armed-and-defiant best
buddies thumb their noses at sexist scum everywhere and embrace in a show of
sisterhood. When things are looking very bleak and the cops are closing fast,
the initially timid Thelma gets this wild look in her eyes and confesses, "I
don't ever remember feelin' this awake.";    Directed without a single false
move by Ridley ("Alien") Scott from an original script by Callie Khouri, "T&amp;L"
is a road movie in the noblest sense of the term. It combines elements from
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "Easy Rider" to chart the spiritual awakening of a pair
of closet outlaws. Kept under thumb too long, they finally blurt out the
equivalent of "We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it anymore!";   
And what ticks off these modern-day Bonnie Parkers? Simple answer: Dumb men.
Longer answer: Louise's musician boyfriend who, after all these years, still
doesn't know how to commit, and Thelma's slob of a car-salesman husband,
Jimmy. These guys have made an art of humoring and humiliating "the little
woman.";    Which is why Louise, a chain-smoking waitress, and Thelma, a
chirpy homemaker, have packed up Louise's blue Thunderbird convertible and
planned a two-day fishing trip. (The irony: At this juncture they only know
how to "drop out" in male terms.);    Women on the run; The friends' first pit
stop is a bad one. Thelma is nearly raped by a honky-tonk Casanova and Louise
rides to the rescue. What the assailant doesn't count on is Louise's pent-up
hatred for men in general. He pays the supreme price and our heroines are
suddenly fugitives -- on the run from the law as well as their old lives.;   
And as they high-tail it to Texas and beyond, their characters merge and
evolve: Louise begins to relax and savor the new-found freedom; the
once-flighty, uptight Thelma discovers untapped reserves of rebellion, as well
as a natural talent for convenience-store stickups. "I know it's crazy, but I
just feel like I got a knack for this s---," Thelma squeals as Louise guns the
getaway car.;    "Thelma &amp; Louise," set to a slide-guitar score by the
prolific Hans Zimmer, is an easy film to dismantle. There will be those who
point to its severe credibility gap, arguing that two women in a blue vintage
T-bird would be as easy to spot as Santa Claus in August. Others will argue
that Scott conveniently sidesteps the violent fallout of his situation by
repeatedly doubling back into hangdog farce. (Easy laughs abound, including a
running joke about a lecherous truck driver who finally gets his
comeuppance.);    Danger and humor; Both criticisms are legitimate. "Thelma &amp;
Louise" only works if you buy into Scott's intermingling of danger and humor,
feminist posturing and wacky asides. He isn't after something like Terrence
Malick's "Badlands" or Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde," both of which deal in
escalating violence. "T&amp;L" is closer in tone to Steven Spielberg's "Sugarland
Express," with Goldie Hawn leading half the state police in Texas on a merry
chase.;    Sarandon and Davis are perfect in the leads. Sarandon is the earthy
anchor, the moody older woman who expects, and finds, the worst in everyone.
Davis is even better in a performance that far outshines her Oscar-winning
work in "The Accidental Tourist." Her Thelma is every pent-up kid on his or
her first joyride. She's a kook and a flirt who, we soon discover, is as
combustible as liquid TNT.;    As for the good ol' boys who pass through our
heroines' lives, they may, for the most part, be underhanded rats, but they're
memorable underhanded rats. Christopher McDonald is hilarious as Thelma's
husband; Brad Pitt steals every one of his scenes as a suspiciously
accommodating hitchhiker whom Thelma cuddles like a stray pup; and Harvey
Keitel, now also in "Mortal Thoughts," turns in what may be his most likable
performance to date as a cop. who secretly empathizes with the women.;   
"Thelma &amp; Louise" is quirky, exuberant fun -- a bit of feminist
wish-fulfillment with the hypnotic sweep of "Easy Rider" and the smarts never
to take itself too seriously.; Thelma &amp; Louise; (star)(star)(star);  Rated: R
(for violence, profanity);    Cast: Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis;    Director:
Ridley Scott;    Writer: Callie Khouri  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Former congressman Wayne L. Hays was
eulogized as a friend of common folk and an ally of Washington's
power elite at a funeral service.
   Hays died Friday after suffering a heart attack at his home in
this eastern Ohio city. He was 77.
   ``Wayne Hays lived and breathed his job as representative of the
18th congressional district,'' said John Malick, a Belmont County
commissioner and longtime friend of the 14-term congressman.
   ``No request was denied. He was fair to Republican and Democrat
alike, rich or poor, black or white. It made no difference.''
   There was no mention, however, of Hays' affair with House clerk
Elizabeth Ray in 1976 that touched off a payroll-sex scandal that
drove him from Congress.
   About 170 people wore heavy coats and gloves during the service
in the East Richland Evangelical Friends Church after its furnace
broke down the previous night.
   Fred Diab, a friend of Hays since childhood, said family members
were disappointed at the turnout but blamed confusion over an
earlier announcement that the service would be closed to the public.
   Hays' wife, Pat, had planned a private service but later changed
her mind, said Monte Beck of the Beck Funeral Home. ``She decided he
was a public man, so why not have a public funeral.''
   Only a few local officeholders attended the funeral. Former
Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich and former U.S. Rep. Robert
Mollohan, D-W.Va., paid their respects on Sunday at the funeral
home, Beck said.
   Malick said Hays was a gentle man who looked out for his
constituents, and he recalled a day when Hays was traveling to
Cleveland and stopped to help a farmer.
   ``He was riding along and saw a cow out in a field calving. Wayne
stopped the car, got out, notified the farmer and stayed there with
him to help deliver that calf,'' Malick said. ``He was an hour late
for his meeting in Cleveland, but that's the way Wayne was.''
   Hays also was known for bringing prominent people from Washington
to Belmont County, Diab said.
   ``I'll never forget when he brought John Kennedy here in 1960,''
Diab said.
   ``You never knew who was going to show up down here with Wayne.''
   Malick said Hays counted Kennedy, presidents Harry Truman and
Lyndon B. Johnson and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger
and Dean Rusk among his allies in Washington.
   Hays was elected to his first term in the U.S. House in 1948. He
became chairman of the House Administration Committee in 1971 and
chairman of the House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
two years later.

On Film: James Brooks Does It Again
---
By Julie Salamon</HL>
<DD> 12/15/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The dialogue in "Broadcast News" is so quick and clever I wanted to see the movie again the minute it ended because I knew I couldn't have possibly caught it all. 
I caught most of it though, and certainly enough to know that this is one terrific movie. 

   It's also a relief to those of us who admired director James Brooks's first picture, the 1983 release "Terms of Endearment." 
It's a relief because after "Terms" became a big box-office hit and won nearly every major film award, Mr. Brooks disappeared from public view. 

   There are some film directors, like Stanley Kubrick, who typically take long breaks between movies. 
But Mr. Brooks was a television man who'd spent much of his adult life working nonstop putting together great TV shows such as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Taxi." 
The role of reclusive auteur didn't seem to fit. 

   There were occasional reports over the years that he was doing research in Washington for a project that had something to do with reporters. 
As time passed, though, it seemed possible that Mr. Brooks had been overwhelmed by the enormous success of his first non-television project. 
Maybe, consumed by the thought that his next picture had to be really important, he would disappear, the way Terrence Malick apparently has, to forever seek material that could never be good enough to commit to film. 

   But no, Mr. Brooks has resurfaced with a film that doesn't show a trace of self-consciousness. 
"Broadcast News" does take on an important subject: how newly budget-conscious networks have come to rely more on glitz and market testing as they cut back on non-glamourous, therefore expendable, personnel. 

   But Mr. Brooks -- who also produced and wrote the film -- works his cogent observations about the network news business into a deft comedy that's written with the zing of the '30s greats. 
He knows how to grab an audience and it's not with lectures on the restructuring of the broadcasting industry. 

   So he's set up a romantic triangle between three representative types: the pretty-boy anchor, the intellectual reporter, the opinionated girl producer. 
They're great characters, too, remarkably authentic but also quirky in ways that make them lovable. 
In fact, Mr. Brooks has put together a great group of actors and gotten great performances out of them. 
Jack Nicholson is a stitch in a small part as the reigning network anchor, a pompous man whose suits are just tight enough to make him seem puffed up. 

   But Mr. Brooks doesn't know how to draw a really nasty character. 
Even the network news president with the undertaker's manner has a certain oily charm (he's played with great style by Peter Hackes, who was an NBC news correspondent before he made his film debut here). 
Mr. Brooks's characters do, however, have real edge -- and real neuroses, which they act out convincingly. 
One of them, the reporter played by the hilarious Albert Brooks, may well be speaking for director Brooks (who is no relation but a good friend) when he says: "Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?" 

   In any case, it's easy to believe director Brooks when he says he wrote the role of the brainy, not-so-photogenic reporter, Aaron Altman, for his old pal Albert. 
Aaron is a familiar type, the nerdy kid who got dumped on by the jocks in high school then spends the rest of his life compensating. 
Aaron is best friends with Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the tough little hyperkinetic producer who thinks she's always right because she generally is. 
Ms. Hunter, who first displayed her sassy, eccentric comic gift in "Raising Arizona," drives the picture forward. 
She's a fireball. 
Her Jane is an obsessive, the kind of person who forges ahead to what she wants and says what she thinks without thinking of the consequences, because she is so sure of herself. 
However, this is a romantic comedy so her systems break down when she isn't working on the perfect newscast. 

   Though Aaron is in love with Jane, or likes to think that he is, the picture's most sensitively realized moments are the scenes that show what make these two such good friends. 
When Jane is heading off for a date with Tom, the handsome anchor, and Aaron is about to try out for a new on-camera job, she checks him out. 
She sighs, reaches inside her evening jacket, pulls out her shoulder pads and slips them inside his coat. 

   Jane and Aaron are defenders of the old guard. 
They have an idea about what network news should be, though you can see from the way they get hepped up by the frenzy that accompanies every newscast that they get a visceral thrill out of the game, too. 

   Tom Grunick (William Hurt), the well-endowed blond Jane falls in love with, represents the new style. 
He isn't dumb. 
He isn't a genius. 
But he can read the news without getting sweaty and he looks great on camera. 
Mr. Hurt plays him astutely, letting you see gradually that he isn't just the pretty face you saw at first before Mr. Hurt let you get to know him better. 

   He's got a skill, and Mr. Brooks establishes that by putting Tom on the spot shortly after he shows up in Washington. 
The news gang is called away from a party to cover a breaking story and Tom, not Aaron -- who's familiar with the subject -- is put on the air. 
The atmosphere behind the control booth is frenzied. 
The tape editor is working away, Jane is telling Tom what to do through a microphone. 

   You hear her voice, coaxing Tom through the story, as the camera glides around behind Tom's handsome head, where you can see that he's all wired up like a ventriloquist's dummy. 
But the way Jane's voice comes across the soundtrack you get a sense of what it's like to have this voice inside your head, while you're talking, and you have to respect Tom for this particular talent. 
He's good. 

   You don't admire him, exactly, but you don't just dismiss him either. 
That's what's great about this movie. 
Mr. Brooks lulls you into thinking that you've got it all figured out and tosses a new perspective at you, a little twist. 
And you get to laugh, too. 
That's what I call entertainment.

AWAKENING TO THE REALITIES OF BLACK LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On his way back from the makeup trailer, actor Danny Glover paused momentarily 
to let a small boy wearing a brightly colored warm-up suit run past his feet. A 
few crew members nearby looked on unconcernedly as the child crashed into his 
father, film writer and director Charles Burnett, and wrapped himself around 
his father's leg. 
</P>
<P>
Glover shook his head, smiling, and continued into the house to shoot his 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it annoyed some of the more experienced crew members who weren't used 
to having kids running around on the set," said Burnett from the production 
office of his film "To Sleep With Anger," which recently finished shooting in 
Adams Heights, near Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them told me, 'This looks like a day-care center,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Burnett's grass-roots project is not a traditional Hollywood 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The low-budget dramatic film -- about three conflicting generations of a modern 
black family who are pulled into the beliefs and influences of the past when a 
mysterious old friend from the Deep South pays a visit -- is expected to be 
completed for less than $2 million. The film features an experienced assembly 
of cast members who are all working for scale wages. (In fact, Glover's 
estimated salary for the current summer smash "Lethal Weapon 2" almost equaled 
this film's total budget.) 
</P>
<P>
"Outside 'The Color Purple,' working with an all-black cast is unusual to me," 
Glover said. "Certainly it's not new to me -- I've been around black people all 
my life." He laughs. "But in this business, I haven't, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this film means there will be more allowment for these kinds of films," 
said the quiet, soft-spoken Burnett, who wrote and directed the project. 
"There's always the concern that a film like this will not be commercial -- 
that was certainly the concern of the producers. That's why this film is so 
hard to do. But I think you have to keep eating away at it. Each film like this 
lays the groundwork for the next." 
</P>
<P>
The shoestring budget for "To Sleep With Anger" is nonetheless a treasure chest 
to Burnett, a 44-year-old film maker who has never worked with a budget of more 
than $80,000. The UCLA film school graduate grew up in South-Central Los 
Angeles. He won critical acclaim in 1977 for his self-financed $10,000 
production "Killer of Sheep," a stark, black-and-white examination of social 
values through the eyes of a black slaughterhouse worker. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too many movies about shootings and stabbings, where the only interest 
is to reduce human beings to butcher-shop byproducts," Burnett said. "It's 
nothing in a film anymore to see a person get their head bashed in or blown 
apart, and I think that's probably one of the reasons why there's so much 
violence on the streets today. Film makers have to take a responsibility and be 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Burnett wrote and directed his second feature-length film, "My 
Brother's Wedding," and wrote several scripts for other independent film 
makers. His work rarely played outside of film festivals and art houses, but 
last year it caught the eye of the MacArthur Foundation, which awarded Burnett 
a $275,000, no-strings-attached "genius" grant over five years. The money 
helped the independent film maker to purchase medical insurance for his family 
and move them out of a small apartment into a modest home. 
</P>
<P>
Sony Video Software Inc., a film production arm of the Sony Corp., is financing 
"To Sleep With Anger." 
</P>
<P>
To keep production costs down, Burnett hired many crew members who had little 
or no experience working on feature films. Several more-qualified workers 
agreed to sign on for less because they believed in the project. In hiring a 
mostly black crew, Burnett said he was offering blacks an opportunity that 
Hollywood seldom presents. 
</P>
<P>
A profit-participation plan will compensate key cast and crew members for their 
lowered salaries, depending upon how well the film does at the box office. 
Glover's considerable financial stake, via his vastly reduced salary, earned 
him the title of co-executive producer in the film's credits. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it was such a low budget and the salaries were so low, we didn't want 
to embarrass anybody and ask them to work with us, unless they really wanted 
to," Burnett said. "I had worked with some of the people before. The whole idea 
was to build this team that really wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett said that one of the most difficult parts of making "To Sleep With 
Anger" was casting it, because there is such a tremendous amount of black 
talent who don't get many chances to showcase their skills in major roles. The 
casting call for the film attracted hundreds of hopeful black actors. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one guy trying out for only one line in a scene," Burnett said, "but 
looking at his resume -- I mean, the guy had years and years of schooling and 
training in theater. And he was pleased just to play this one scene." The actor 
got the job. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," about an escalating race riot in 
Brooklyn, "To Sleep With Anger" is not about racism but about a family's 
struggle to survive in a changing world. The film's cast is hoping that with 
the help of film makers like Lee, the theater door has opened far enough to 
permit a film starring a black family. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks usually play isolated roles in films, like the best friend, or the 
criminal, or the musician, or an extra," said cast member Richard Brooks, who 
was recently in the Vietnam film "84 Charlie Mo-Pic." "With a movie like this, 
when there is an all-black or largely black cast, then I can play the son -- 
the kid with the normal problems dealing with my mother and father. Those 
things are more real to me, as opposed to always being the loner, the outsider, 
trying to swim across the current and move through the world." 
</P>
<P>
When casting the lead roles, Burnett said he and his producers considered "just 
about everybody in the business." Glover committed to the project first. Others 
actors who followed: Mary Alice, Paul Butler, Carl Lumbly, Sheryl Lee Ralph and 
Vonetta McGee. 
</P>
<P>
In "To Sleep With Anger," Glover plays Harry Mann, who Burnett said is a 
folklore character handed down over generations from the Deep South. As a 
child, Burnett was told that if he went out to a wooded area alone, Harry would 
steal his soul. In order to keep that from happening, kids have to learn to 
out-wile him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those stories are traditionally kept alive more in the South," Burnett 
said. "I remember when I was a kid my grandmother used to tell me a lot of 
those stories. I don't know if that's happening as much today. I think there's 
this concern about losing that oral tradition." 
</P>
<P>
In his script, Burnett said, "the father, Gideon, tells his sons animal stories 
to instill old values in his sons. One son embraces his father's world, while 
his materialistic brother rejects it and chooses his own course. When Harry 
shows up, through a series of trivial conflicts that lead to life or death, he 
changes the whole nature of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the kind of trust that Charles has," Glover said. "You can see his 
silence and patience on the screen. He allows everything to unfold. It's like a 
flower you can't rush. It has to blossom." 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "To Sleep With Anger" say that they are taking a chance on a 
film by a little-known director whose subject matter may be too narrow for 
general audiences to find appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any film maker has to do films about his own experience, and if he's a 
great film maker, then that will translate into a universal subject," said 
co-executive producer Ed Pressman ("Wall Street"). Pressman is known for 
producing the early commercial films of directors such as Oliver Stone ("The 
Hand"), Brian De Palma ("Sisters") and Terrence Malick ("Badlands"). Last year, 
he approached Charles Burnett to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be crazy for Charles to do this subject and adapt it for popular 
consumption. It wouldn't be real to him and it wouldn't be his vision. And 
those are the things that make a film work," Pressman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This film is not about a white family," co-executive producer Harris Tulchin 
said. "I don't even know how you would fit a white person in here. What you 
don't want to do -- which I've seen done in the past -- is try to fit white 
people into a story about a black family just so you can say, 'Hey look, we 
have a white star. We can get much better promotion. We can get more people in 
theaters.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There's always skepticism in these situations," said Mary Alice, whose 
performance in "Fences" on Broadway won her a best-actress Tony. "When we 
opened 'Fences,' nobody thought that a play about a black family would make it 
on Broadway. But look -- the play was a smash. Night after night, the audience 
was filled -- with whites and blacks."

<LEADPARA>  THERE'S no accounting for tastes when it comes to humor, which may explain why
HBO's "Dream On" returns for a second season this Sunday night. Left to me,
"Dream On" would be tied to a ton of lead weights, resting at the bottom of
the Marianas Trench.;    This weekly series follows the trials and
tribulations of Martin Tupper, a Manhattan book editor who's still hung up on
his ex-wife, Judith, even though she's now married to Dr. Richard Stone, a
physician with the aura of a young, handsome Albert Schweitzer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The trademark gimmick of the show is that we get to "see" what's going on

voiced every now and then by actors in quick takes from old TV shows.;    It's
played so broadly that it ought to be an animated cartoon. It also feels
obliged to work in nudity and four-letter words whenever possible, just to
remind us we're watching unregulated, uncensored pay TV.;    But I recognize
that this is just my opinion and that many others disagree. This show was, in
fact, picked as the best cable series of 1990 in a poll of TV critics by
Electronic Media, a broadcasting trade weekly.;    As it happens, "Dream On"
has become a sort of "in" show in Hollywood, attracting lots of big names who
want to participate in all the "fun." This is kind of what happened with
"Batman" in the 1960s and Shelley Duvall's "Faerie Tale Theatre" in the
1980s.;    In the special one-hour season premiere, for example, movie stars
Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers join actor/rock star David Bowie as featured
players while the stars who contribute cameos include Sylvester Stallone,
Ricardo Montalban, Eva Gabor and Yvonne De Carlo. Sunday's episode is directed
by executive producer John Landis, whose feature films include "The Blues
Brothers," "Trading Places" and many other biggies.;    The ludicrous premise
of Sunday's show is that a movie company has decided to film Stone's life
story. While Stone is off helping save a rain forest in Brazil, Judith (Wendie
Malick) and Martin (Brian Benben) decide to visit the set to see how they're
being portrayed.;    It's misfortune from the start. The director (Bowie)
turns out to be a foul-mouthed autocrat who spots Judith on the set and
mistakes her for the actress (Rogers) he's hired to play Judith.;    "That
blouse is a disease," he snarls at the shocked Judith. "This is not the wife
of Richard Stone. This is the wife of a civil servant from Bayonne, New
Jersey. There's no style, no wit, not a trace of sexuality!" The director then
makes a very crude remark about Judith's private parts, which not only offends
Judith, but ought to offend most viewers as well.;    Once the
misunderstanding is straightened out, Judith and Martin are allowed to watch
the shooting. Immediately, Martin notices Judith is being played as a most
desirable woman, but he's being portrayed as a wuss. Which goes to show we
often don't see ourselves the way we really are.;    Ultimately, Judith finds
herself falling for the actor who's playing Richard (Berenger) while,
unaccountably, Mimi Rogers gets the hots for Martin. This leads to many scenes
of Rogers in bed with a wuss.;    However, Rogers does not do nude scenes, at
least not for TV money, so the story has to go elsewhere for the compulsory
toplessness: Martin keeps wandering into the wrong set, where they're filming
a cheap horror movie about naked girls being chased by a giant human fungus.; 
  If you're wondering how they worked Sly Stallone into all this, it comes in
a scene in which Stallone is doing a talk show and is asked if he has any
regrets about his career.;    "I have only one regret," he says. "It's not
playing Richard Stone in 'The Richard Stone Story.' ";    The other cameo
performers are equally wasted, none so cruelly as De Carlo.;    "It wasn't
always this way," she observes, followed by one of Martin's "dream" clips
showing her in her curvaceous youth.;    Among the "Dream On" regulars, only
Malick is remotely bearable. But her character is way too ditzy for my taste.
Maybe I'm just out of patience with sitcoms in which the characters are people
I'd try to avoid in real life.;    So I'm afraid "Dream On" is starting its
second season as tasteless and unfunny as it was last season. Spending an hour
with this is the best way to appreciate "Cheers" and all the other really
funny shows we get free.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Returning to his bad-guy beginnings, Richard
Gere is back in the movie fast lane after a lapse that had
Hollywood wondering if he was more interested in causes than an
acting career.
   Gere crashed onto the movie scene in 1977 as one of Diane
Keaton's sleazy boyfriends in ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar.'' It was a
small part and helped get him the lead as the male prostitute in
the seamy ``American Gigolo'' in 1980.
   He soon became a top leading man, most notably in the 1982 hit
``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' A few bombs followed, then a long
absence from the screen. He seemed to be devoting all his energies
to alerting the public to the longtime Chinese repression in Tibet.
   Now Gere has returned to the movie bigtime in Paramount
Picture's ``Internal Affairs,'' starring as a crooked cop. The film
received mixed reviews from critics, but has found favor with
audiences, earning $11 million in two weeks.
   Gere next appears in a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts,
``Pretty Woman,'' for Touchstone Pictures.
   ``Internal Affairs'' casts Gere as Dennis Peck, a veteran Los
Angeles street cop who has become an expert in extortion and
murder-for-hire. Andy Garcia is the detective who investigates him.
Peck is a thorough sleaze and misogynist, but Gere doesn't see him
that way.
   ``He doesn't think he's bad. You know, this was a very tough
script. It was a very disturbing read, as well as to see it. I had
to really look into it to see what was so disturbing and what was
worthwhile about the film,'' Gere said.
   ``I realized that it was similar to Iago and Othello. It was
that kind of evil: the evil of Iago. In Peck's case it was the same
as Othello; it was jealousy that he pinpoints.
   ``The more I looked into him, the more I saw of this incredible
megalomaniac control _ not the small kind that we have in most of
our lives, but an extraordinary kind of octopus of arms and
tentacles going out in all directions. He had five wives and ten
kids, and he controlled these families as well as the police
department. But on the other hand, he did not need to be more than
a foot soldier.''
   Gere plays his own age, 40, graying hair and all. He sounds like
an old-timer when he comments about co-star Garcia: ``I saw in him
_ he's in his early 30s _ a lot of myself when I was his age. I had
the same level of intensity that he's coming from.''
   He added with a grin: ``I keep telling them I can play 18 but
they don't believe me. (Age) doesn't bother me either way. There
are a couple of films I'm developing that would be aging movies,
from the late 20s into the 50s. Certainly playing the younger of
those characters I would dye my hair.''
   Throughout his career, Gere has never been comfortable with
interviews. But he seemed more at ease when he was recently here to
promote ``Internal Affairs.'' Except for the little-seen ``Miles
From Home,'' he has been absent from the big screen for three
years. During much of that time he devoted himself to the cause of
his longtime friend, the Dalai Lama. The actor helped establish
Tibet House New York, aimed at preserving the country's heritage.
   Two events last year helped bring Tibet's plight to the world's
attention, he said, citing the massacre during pro-democracy
protests by Chinese students in Tiananmen Square, and the awarding
of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama _ Gere attended the
presentation ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.
   He said Tiananmen Square was ``perhaps 10 percent of what the
Chinese have been doing every day in Tibet for 35 years.''
   Gere was born in Philadelphia and grew up on a farm near
Syracuse, N.Y. He remembers his debut as an actor: ``My first role
was Santa Claus in the second grade. My mother made the costume
herself, which she still reminds me of. In high school I played the
president of the United States, and the entire audience of my peers
started howling that Dick Gere was playing the president.
   ``At 19 I left college (University of Massachusetts), thinking I
had done nothing with my life. That's when I went into repertory.''
   After work at the Provincetown Playhouse and the Seattle
Repertory Theater, he played off-Broadway roles and Danny Zuko in
the New York and London companies of ``Grease.'' His film debut
came in Terence Malick's ``Days of Heaven.'' He also co-starred in
the Broadway production of ``Bent'' after ``American Gigolo.''
   A series of mishaps _ ``Breathless,'' ``Beyond the Limits,''
``The Cotton Club,'' ``King David,'' ``Power,'' ``No Mercy'' _
spelled trouble for Gere's career. But like John Travolta with
``Look Who's Talking,'' he appears on the rebound.
   Of his recent absence, he said: ``It wasn't the wisest thing in
the world, but I'm in this for the rest of my life. As long as I
can keep growing as an individual, the career will take care of
itself.''

Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts (KCOP, 
Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek burglar who falls for a high-tech interior 
designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her stolen diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an 
all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), viewed by Garr's sons with 
increasing horror. 
</P>
<P>
Sunburn (KTTV, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) finds Charles Grodin as a cocky, nebbish 
insurance investigator looking into a death in Acapulco and renting Farrah 
Fawcett to cover as his wife. Sloppy, witless, forced, characterless. 
</P>
<P>
The deft Back to the Beach (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) imagines that Annette 
Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" movies of the early 
U60s got married and settled down in Ohio. The film is nostalgic without being 
embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty 
Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis 
as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice 
Hitchcock touches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Beyond the Stars (KTTV, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon with 
a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of the 
most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love 
triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere, 
Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious 
70mm camerawork. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidnapping of the President (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980 
theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a 
U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director 
William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to 
disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner.

hard-bitten madam. With Julie Harris.

about an Atlanta homeboy named Dexter, played by Terrence "T.C." Carson. What
he wants to be is the Man. At least, he wants to be the man on the TV news.
But he talks like a rapper. He dresses funky. And no way are they putting that

<TEXT>     But then our homeboy gets film of himself breaking up a hostage situation.
And suddenly the white folks think he's def and give him a job.;   They also
give him a make-over. And Dexter begins to talk a tad differently. His clothes
take on that ever-so-starched Brooks Brothers look. He seems to be turning
just a touch -- dare we say it? -- Caucasian.;   Dexter's friends warn him
that he's changing. But he likes what he sees. He likes the fat salary, the
perks, the stardom and the penthouse apartment in Whyteman Towers. And when
Kate, the ravenous executive producer (Blanche Baker), steers him away from
investigative reporting in favor of slash-and-burn attacks on the black
community, he happily goes along.;   There's a great idea for satire here. TV
news is an easy target, but it's still fun to hit it squarely. A reporter at
the station is killed in the line of duty -- and is posed tenderly in
hisREVIEW; casket clutching a microphone. The executive producer loads the
shows with stories on UFOs and Siamese twins. Flashy graphics rule the day.
When Kate proposes a particularly bizarre ratings ploy, even Dexter draws back
in horror. "You're joking," he says. "I never joke about ratings," she
replies.;   Apart from the reheated "Network" jokes, there's also a very real
story here about assimilation, and fitting in, and whether it's truly
desirable to cater to a majority just to get ahead. It's nice to see that
addressed, even in passing.;   But then recent films made for young black
audiences seem more serious than the films being made for primarily young
white audiences. Black teens see themselves up on the screen in "House Party"
and "Boyz N The Hood." White teens see themselves getting speared by Freddy.
Black teen-agers can see inventive movies by John Singleton and Charles Lane.
White teen-agers are given movies by John Hughes, who has been making films
about Chicago for more than 15 years and still can't find a black
neighborhood.;   "Livin' Large" has the chance to tell an interesting story
about prejudice. But then it sabotages itself. And the weapon is its own
casual, clumsy racism.;   Dexter doesn't just try to be white. He becomes
white. His nose becomes aquiline. His eyes turn blue. His hair turns blond.
It's the old horror film transformation, only this time it's "An American
Honky in Atlanta." In a kind of climax midway through the film, he even
forgets how to dance.;   Some of this is funny. But the transformation --
which only Dexter can see, on television -- becomes more pronounced every time
he does something underhanded, or callous, or cruel. And the Dorian White
message becomes uncomfortably clear: Be evil, turn Caucasian.;   Is that kind
of message acceptable in a satire? Would it be acceptable if this were a film
about business executives, and every time the characters did something
unethical they looked a little more Asian? Or Arab? Or whoever we're supposed
to be hating at the moment?;   Maybe it's a minor point. Whites, after all,
are a majority in the United States. They don't face systemized racism. They
haven't had to suffer through 70-odd years of Hollywood stereotyping.;   But
any stereotype is hurtful, and the film indulges in a lot of them. In pure
"Sanford and Son" style, all black women are hellions, all black men are
comical, all white men are clowns or ineffectual drunks and all white women
are manipulative monsters.;   The film was directed by the veteran Michael
Schultz, who should know better, and is acted largely by a cast of novices.
Carson is winning as Dexter Jackson, and Nathaniel "Afrika" Hall is fine as
his friend, Baker. Lisa Arrindell has a kind of sweet intensity as Dexter's
fiance, Toynelle -- she's so good she seems to be in a different movie.;  
Baker -- the adult daughter of '50s sex symbol Carroll Baker -- plays the
executive producer with clenched teeth and barely suppressed sexuality. She
doesn't just chew the scenery, she cuts it up with a knife and fork and washes
it down with the supporting cast. It's the kind of performance that's
absolutely wrong for satire, which needs to be played very seriously and
straight to be funny at all.;   But then a number of things in this movie are
very wrong.;   Livin' Large; (star) 1/2; Rated: R (profanity, sexual
encounters); Cast: Terrence "T.C." Carson, Lisa Arrindell, Blanche Baker,
Nathaniel "Afrika" Hall; Director: Michael Schultz; Writer: William Mosely
Payne; Running Time: 1 hour, 36 minutes  </TEXT>

Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts 
(Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek San Francisco burglar who falls for a 
high-tech interior designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her 
stolen diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an 
all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), whose sons (Corey Haim, 
Christopher Collet), ages 10 and 15 respectively, view with increasing horror. 
</P>
<P>
The deft and amusing Back to the Beach (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
imagines that Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" 
movies of the early '60s got married and settled down in Ohio where Frankie has 
become a workaholic champion car salesman and Annette a model housewife and 
mother; what gets them back to Malibu is a visit to their daughter. The film is 
nostalgic without being embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or 
cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty 
Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis 
as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice 
Hitchcock touches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Beyond the Stars (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon 
with a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of 
the most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love 
triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere, 
Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious 
70mm camerawork. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidnapping of the President (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980 
theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a 
U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director 
William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to 
disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Elia Kazan's unforgettable 1955 film of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (Channel 
13 Friday at 8 p.m.) stars James Dean as the tormented Salinas Valley youth 
with a stern father (Raymond Massey) and a mother (Jo Van Fleet) who turns out 
to be the local hard-bitten madam. 
</P>
<P>
A Special Day (Channel 28 Saturday at 10:40 p.m.), Ettore Scola's stunning 1977 
film of strong contemporary implications, teams Sophia Loren as weary, 
oppressed Roman housewife and mother of six and Marcello Mastroianni as a 
homosexual threatened with imminent deporation to a concentration camp who meet 
during Hitler's triumphant procession through Rome on May 6, 1938.

<HEAD>Expelled Diplomat's Son Returns Home With Social Worker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Zimbabwean diplomat who was expelled
from the United States for allegedly abusing his 9-year-old son
said the boy returned home today from New York accompanied by a
Zimbabwean social worker.
   Diplomat Floyd Karamba said his son, Terrence, was immediately
placed under the care of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency reported.
   ``My son arrived this morning accompanied by a Zimbabwean social
worker and is in normal condition,'' Karamba was quoted as saying.
   U.S. officials said Terrence Karamba left New York for Zimbabwe
on Sunday accompanied by a Zimbabwean social worker. He will not be
returned to his father's custody, according to reports today in the
New York Daily News, the Washington Post and the Washington Times.
   Zimbabwe has said it will place the boy in the auspices of the
courts and the state ministry of social welfare, said Robert J.
McMahon, director of the New York social services agency that cared
for the boy for the past two months.
   McMahon, head of St. Christopher-Ottile Services for Children
and Families, was also quoted today saying the Zimbabwean
government said the Karamba family will undergo counseling in hopes
of eventually reuniting Terrence with the family.
   A New York government agency had charged that Floyd Karamba had
beaten the boy, who in December was removed from his home and
placed in foster care.
   The father, who served for more than a year as a member of
Zimbabwe's delegation to the United Nations, was ordered Dec. 21 to
leave the United States because of what State Department officials
called ``clear evidence of child abuse.''
   In January, the Supreme Court refused to block the U.S.
government from sending the boy home despite arguments from the
Legal Aid Society that the boy was afraid to go home.
   McMahon said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., interceded
and persuaded the State Department that the boy should not be
returned immediately.
   The State Department had a psychiatric consultant accompany the
boy on his trip home and also engaged a law firm in Zimbabwe to
monitor his case, the Post reported.
   Karamba's wife and two other children returned to Zimbabwe in
January$

  [Text] Haitian Armed Forces Headquarters announced that the 
forces of order conducted simultaneous operations in the regions 
of Malick, Petionville, Thomassin 23, and Carrefour-Marin, 
Croix-des-Bouquets, on 5 March. During these operations, a 
stockpile of weapons, ammunition, and explosives were seized, 
and some people were arrested. 
  The preliminary elements of the investigation, according to 
the press release, confirm that this group of terrorists 
intended that same day to attack military posts in the capital 
and in the Central Department, to perpetrate attacks against 
civilian leaders, and against members of the Haitian Armed 
Forces and their relatives. 
  The Army Headquarters, in this press release, asks all 
Haitians for actions favoring the spirit of dialogue, 
consultation, and reconciliation in view of finding a Haitian 
solution to our country's problems, for too long wounded by the 
division among its children.

   For the second time in little more than a
year a sailor has died in a training pool at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station, and an investigation has been ordered, Navy officials said
Saturday.
   A naval aviation reserve officer candidate collapsed and died
Friday in shallow water after completing an abandon-ship drill, said
Navy spokeswoman Maggie Malick.
   Michael J. Fedie, 22, of Altoona, Wis., was participating in a
drill that requires students to jump off a tower and swim a short
distance underwater while holding their breath.
   ``He had completed an abandon-ship drill and was walking out of
the pool when he collpsed,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Robert Tyler.
   After he fell back into the water, safety officers pulled the
trainee from the pool and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation
before an ambulance took him to the off-base Pensacola Naval
Hospital, Tyler said. Doctors pronounced him dead about 4:15 p.m.
   ``An investigation has been ordered by the chief of naval air
training at the base to determine the circumstances of the death,''
Tyler said.
   Preliminary autopsy results indicated the cause of death was
acute cerebral edema, said Kay Esty, a spokeswoman for the Naval
Education and Training Command. Edema is an abnormal accumulation of
fluid. She said a final autopsy to confirm the cause of death would
not be completed for several weeks.
   Fedie's father, Felix, described his son Saturday as an
``excellent swimmer.''
   Fedie, from Altoona, Wis., said based on his information from the
Navy, it did not appear foul play was involved in his son's death.
   After the March 2, 1988, drowning of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki,
19, of Appleton, Wis., five instructors were disciplined, the
commander of the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Capt. C.L.
Lavinder, was officially reprimanded prior to his retirement and
four other supervisors were given warning letters.
   The death of Mirecki during rescue-swimmer training triggered a
Navy-wide review of hazardous training and resulted in changes in
procedures at the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, including a ban
against touching students by instructors.
   A pathologist concluded that Mirecki had a phobia about being
dragged underwater, which triggered heart failure before he drowned.
   Felix Fedie, father of the sailor who died Friday, called his son
``an excellent swimmer.''
   ``He was a great, great kid,'' Fedie said Saturday from his home
in Altoona, Wis. ``He was smart and outgoing.''
   He said his son planned to return to Wisconsin after the swimming
program to complete an engineering degree at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, and then planned to resume flight training.
   In the Mirecki case, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, 28,
of Tempe, Ariz., lost a stripe and was sentenced to 90 days in the
brig after being found guilty of negligent homicide at a
court-martial for holding Mirecki's head under water.
   The other four instructors received administrative penalties of
fines or rank reductions, but the officer in charge of the rescue
school, Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, was exonerated at another
court-martial.
   The other instructors had been accused of forcing Mirecki back
into the pool after he had panicked and climbed out, ordering other
students to turn away and sing the national anthem while Combe
dunked him.
   Mirecki's family has filed a $20 million claim against the Navy.

   A 13-year-old honor student was
sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison for fatally stabbing a
schoolmate 97 times, but the sentence will be evaluated when he
turns 17.
   Terrence, who was 12 when the slaying occurred, showed no
emotion when the verdict was read Thursday or when the sentence was
ordered.
   He will begin his sentence at a state youth facility. When he
turns 17, a judge will decide whether to release him or order him
to serve the rest of his sentence in a state prison.
   Terrence Sampson was convicted of murder in the December 1989
death of his next-door neighbor, Kelly Brumbelow, 13. He was tried
under a law allowing youths as young as 10 to be tried as juveniles
and adults.
   Kelly was found dead under a wood pile in the Sampson's
backyard.
   The two were honor students in the seventh grade at C.D. Fulkes
Middle School. Terrence played on the football team and Kelly was a
cheerleader.
   The boy's attorney, Chris Gunter, said he will appeal the
conviction.
   `Like I said in my closing arguments, no matter what the facts
are, he was just 12 years old at the time, and I really do question
whether he understood the concept of death,'' Gunter said.

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunger, disease, war and years of
economic hardship are ravaging the bodies of Africa's children and
traumatizing their minds, the U.N. Children's Fund said Wednesday.
   While the situation of children in much of the world has
improved, children in Africa have quietly fallen victim, often
fatally, to cuts in social spending and wars in which they are
killed or turned into child killers, the organization said.
   At a ceremony to launch its 1991 report on the State of the
World's Children, the UNICEF director in the Ivory Coast, Malick
Sene, listed statistics he said were ``a scandal'' and challenged
the morality of a world tat allows such horrors. Sene is from
Mali.
   He said Africa is the only continent where social spending has
been cut dramatically, where most children never go to school and
where most people wake daily to the fear of not finding enough
food.
   Africa has the world's highest rate of child deaths from easily
preventable disease and infections - more than one-third of the 15
million deaths each year attributed to such causes. Nearly half the
world's 25 million refugees are African children and their mothers.
   Sene said Africans have done little to combat such new social
phenonena as the large numbers of street children created by
poverty and urban migration, and the deadly AIDS virus that in
Africa affects women and children in equal numbers to male victims.
   ``Most terrifying of all is the situation of children embroiled
in conflicts despite themselves - child soldiers, child killers
(created by) conflicts whose violence will produce incalculable
traumas,'' he said.
   ``What can we say about the particularly sad scandal of refugee
children, for example - scores of thousands just in our region
today. Exploited children, enslaved children, children daily
ravaged by famine and hunger while we talk of human rights for
adults,'' Sene said.
   Such outrages against children pose a moral problem that UNICEF
believes can be solved if developed countries keep their promises
to improve the lives of the world's children using money diverted
from defense spending, he said.
   Sene said UNICEF estimates the $20 billion needed to produce
healthier children by the turn of the century amounts to just 10
days of world expenditure on armies and munitions.
   African governments, particularly the military administrations
that hold sway in West Africa, long have been criticized for
allocating large amounts of their budgets for defense and little
for social services.
   Health and Social Protection Minister Alain Ekra of the Ivory
Coast, one of a handful of civilian governments in the region, said
the health of his relatively wealthy country's children has
deteriorated. Last year, the Ivory Coast cut the ministry's budget
by 30 percent.
   ``The situation of children and women improved rapidly in the
first two decades after our independence (in 1960) thanks to
appreciable efforts by the government,'' he said. ``Unhappily,
because of a runaway birth rate and persistent economic recession,
we are seeing a stagnation, even a deterioration in the
situation.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three small plane crashes left one man dead and 10 injured
Tuesday and six others were injured when severe weather buffeted a
Braniff Airlines jet on its approach to Orlando, Fla.
   The Braniff jet landed safely and none of the injuries from the
four incidents appeared to be life-threatening.
   Meanwhile, a Taca International Airlines Boeing 737 lost power
in both engines while making an approach in heavy thunderstorms and
glided to a safe landing near an abandoned airstrip 24 miles short
of New Orleans International Airport. None of the 36 passengers and
nine crew members was hurt.
   In Pontiac, Mich., the pilot of a home-built airplane died after
his aircraft crashed at Oakland-Pontiac Airport, officials said.
The other crashes occurred during a commuter plane's takeoff in
Lawton, Okla., and after a U.S. Customs Service plane lost power
outside San Angelo, Texas.
   Police identified the victim as Harold R. Chappell Jr., 48, of
Ortonville, whose plane crashed at 3:07 p.m. EDT.
   Chappell died after two hours of surgery at Pontiac Osteopathic
Hospital, said Dr. David Malicke, an emergency room physician.
   Chappell was circling the airport when a section of material
covering one wing peeled away from the wooden frame, causing a loss
of lift and sending the plane into a spin, police said.
   In Oklahoma, an Atlantic Southeast Airlines commuter plane
crashed on takeoff from Lawton Municipal Airport, injuring the six
passengers and two crew members aboard, authorities said.
   ``I saw smoke pop up and had no idea where it was from,'' said
Sissy Anderson, a receptionist at Jet Away, an aircraft servicing
and maintenance company. ``They say it was taking off, bounced down
and hit the ground, bounced and hit again before the fire broke.''
   There were unconfirmed reports the 18-passenger Bandarante
plane, which authorities said was bound for Dallas, lost an engine
on takeoff.
   Two people were in serious condition at Comanche County Memorial
Hospital and a third person was listed in good condition, said
spokeswoman Kelly Brack.
   Brad Mitchell, a spokesman at Southwestern Medical Center, said
three people were in stable condition with cuts and bruises and two
others were being examined.
   Braniff's Flight 723 carrying 55 passengers from Indianapolis
was hit by heavy rain and winds at 13,000 feet and about 35 miles
west of Orlando International Airport, an airline official said.
   ``The seatbelt signs were on, but it happened suddenly,'' said
Braniff Vice President Jim Thomson.
   The BAC-111, two-engine aircraft landed safely without any
emergency procedures shortly before 4 p.m. EDT and did not appear
to be damaged, he said.
   Four passengers and two flight attendants were in stable
condition with cuts and bruises that did not appear serious, said
Joe Brown, spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center.
   Two flight attendants were treated for minor cuts and abrasions
and released from Humana Lucerne Hospital, said spokesman Larry
Harrell.
   The National Weather Service reported a band of thunderstorms
hit central Florida during the afternoon.
   Boaters rescued two men after a U.S. Customs Service plane lost
power in both engines and crashed into a lake outside San Angelo,
Texas, officials said.
   A pilot and a student pilot were practicing takeoffs and
landings from Mathis Field when their Cessna lost power, said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston.
   The men were being treated at Angelo Community Hospital, but
their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, nursing
supervisor Mike Wood said. Conroy said the men, whose names were
not released, suffered facial cuts.

   Partway through "The Fisher King," Terry Gilliam's
engaging new film, the rush-hour crush in Manhattan's Grand
Central Terminal is transformed into a lyrically romantic set
piece. The crush of commuters, tourists and homeless people
suddenly breaks into a dizzying waltz, under the glow of the
elegant chandeliers. Instead of pressing ahead to the
individual concerns propelling them forward, these people are
all swept up in the fantasy that is implied in the grandeur
of the architecture. Instead of avoiding one another --
afraid of facing yet another beggar -- the crowd gracefully
moves together in a glittering dream.
   The moment passes and they are no longer revelers but
commuters, tourists and homeless people once again. It's a
great scene -- beautiful and a little nutty, the kind of
thing one would expect from Mr. Gilliam, a director who
specializes in the phantasmagorical ("Time Bandits,"
"Brazil," "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen").
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elsewhere in "The Fisher King" Mr. Gilliam has restrained
himself, perhaps reacting to the criticism that his films
rely too much on the spectacular, too little on "real"
character and emotion. So he devotes much more screen time to
his characters and less to the brilliant set pieces he stages
so well.
   The result is a movie whose rhythms are uneven: You feel
as if Mr. Gilliam is trying to conform to somebody else's
conventions (this is the first time he's directed a movie
that wasn't his idea from the start). Sometimes the pictures
strains to make its points about humanity and true happiness,
and slides into sentimentality. But Mr. Gilliam's
imagination, with its mix of mischief and melancholy, gives
the movie a satisfying spark, enough to overcome its pat
message of upbeat poignancy.
   It's easy to see what drew the director to Richard
LaGravenese's dark fable about a powerful, foul talk-radio
host named Jack Lucas who drops out of the business and
becomes a drunk worker in a video store after a listener he'd
egged on goes out and commits mass murder. Jack, who has
remained an arrogant cynic even after he's gone off the air,
stumbles into a homeless man who holds the secret to his
redemption. The homeless man, who calls himself Parry, was a
college professor driven mad by a horrible tragedy. Parry is
obsessed by the legend of the Fisher King, who forgot the
meaning of life until the court jester reminded him of it
(love, not power).
   Mr. Gilliam plays out the theme with a darkly romantic
vision. He's constructed the story visually as a medieval
fairy tale set in a contemporary Manhattan that's part
Gothic, part Gershwin. When Parry and his homeless friends
rescue Jack from a couple of thugs, they top their act by
singing "I Love New York in Spring." In fact, more than
anything, the movie reminds me of a great Broadway musical,
without the music (except for a second grand set piece, in
which Michael Jeter, a skinny man, pays homage to Ethel
Merman with delirious perfection).
   Jeff Bridges has the guts not to make Jack the ex-deejay
endearing. The actor has played variations on this kind of
man before, and he's perfected that brand of hip
discouragement. There isn't much to like about him. He's a
whiner when he's up and he's a whiner when he's down.
   Robin Williams gets to pull out all his tricks to play
Parry. He can be the wild man who talks to invisible people,
the sentimentalist and the moralist. There's a deep, sad
strain there that's entirely believable; he's one of few
actors today who could tell the legend of the Fisher King
(while lying naked on his back in Central Park at night) and
get away with it.
   This eccentric love story includes women, and Mr. Gilliam
has chosen two of the better eccentric actresses. Mercedes
Ruehl plays Anne, the video-store owner who took Jack in
after he gave up his talk show. With Ms. Ruehl around,
fireworks are beside the point. She's a walking visual and
emotional display. You want to hug her one minute and put her
behind glass the next. Yet she's the girl next door compared
with Lydia, the klutzy girl of Parry's dreams, played sweetly
bizarre by Amanda Plummer.

   "Livin' Large" is a lively spoof about a young black man
who accidentally becomes a local newscaster then sells his
soul to his ambitious executive producer to become a star.
   Terrence "T.C." Carson is Dexter Jackson, an amiable kid
with a video camera whose heros are newsmen. He's on hand
when a field correspondent gets shot while reporting a
"hostage situation," and goes on camera and impresses the
Atlanta station's executives with his prowess under pressure.
The executive producer, a woman with short blond hair and a
glint in her eye, spots Dexter's ambition and signs him on.
   Michael Schultz, a black director who was working before
black directors became trendy (his work includes "Greased
Lightning" and "Which Way Is Up") has a nice, breezy style.
Though the film doesn't purport to carry any big message,
William Mosely Payne's script is actually quite astute on the
slide of local news into sleaze. He takes the position -- not
entirely fair -- that blacks and women have advanced only
because they're willing to emphasize murder and mayhem to
enhance ratings. As their careers advance they fall into
moral decline.
   The movie is especially cynical (and funny) in its view of
the white women who succeed. The producer Kate, played with
nasty precision by Blanche Baker, has sacrificed everything
-- judgment, a personal life, ethics -- for ratings. The
weather woman, played by Julia Campbell, is no less ruthless
but has rigged a kind of personal life by using sex to
advance her career.
   Dexter goes along with Kate's plans for a while, but
starts to panic when his version of the portrait of Dorian
Gray starts staring at him from his television screen
(instead of eternal youth, he gets to be white).
   ---
   The actor Sean Penn has directed and written his first
film, "The Indian Runner." This story of two brothers, one
good and one bad, takes place in a small Nebraskan town and
reveals a serious intent unaccompanied by a clear idea of how
to bring a story to life on film.
   Mr. Penn has encouraged his actors (he doesn't play a
part) to precede almost every line of dialogue with a pause.
Even the grunts are preceded by pauses. He does understand
how to compose a visually interesting scene, but the scenes
don't connect. The movie is a collection of poses and
emotional vignettes.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Mr. Gilliam's films generally divide people
into two distinct camps: love 'em/hate 'em. Whichever group
you fall into you will have to admit these movies contain
some of the most exciting images ever put on film. Try "Time
Bandits," "Brazil," "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen."

   A man convicted in the racially
motivated shooting of a black youth has been sentenced to the
maximum of 14 years and eight months in state prison.
   Mark Shane Lashley, 29, was sentenced Tuesday by Superior Court
Judge John Shook, who convicted Shook in a non-jury trial last
month of second-degree attempted murder, a felony civil rights
charge and a misdemeanor civil rights count.
   Shook called the 1988 shooting in Playa del Rey an ``egregious
offense against society for which (Lashley) will be punished
severely with a maximum sentence, which is so justly and richly
deserved.''
   According to trial testimony, 14-year-old Terrence Goudeau and
three young cousins were fishing on June 26, 1988, when Lashley and
two friends shouted racial slurs at them.
   The boys yelled back and the argument escalated, ending when
Lashley aimed a .22-caliber rifle at Goudeau, who ran, shielding a
12-year-old cousin.
   Goudeau was shot in the back, and a bullet nicked a lung. Bullet
fragments remain embedded near his spine.
   Lashley's attorney, Lloyd Riley, who is black, called the prison
term unreasonably harsh and said there was ``too much emphasis on
the factor of race.''

BIG BROTHERS POINT WAY TO SUCCESS FOR 2 PREP STARS; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: BANNING HURDLER TERRENCE CAMPBELL HAS THE BEST POSSIBLE ROLE MODEL. HIS 
BROTHER TONIE IS A THREE-TIME OLYMPIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terrence Campbell would sit in front of the television as a youngster and watch 
with envy as his older brother Tonie would win race after race in the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Terrence would rush out to the front lawn of the Campbell's 
house in Carson and set up a line of cardboard boxes. Then he would jump over 
each one in succession and imagine he was his brother on his way to another 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The childhood fantasy would have to wait for years to become a reality, 
however, since Terrence didn't begin running the hurdles competitively until 
his sophomore year at Banning High. By then, Tonie was gearing up for an 
unprecedented third straight appearance in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence, 18, is a senior at Banning and in no way the track equal of his 
brother. But then again, when Tonie was a senior at Banning in 1978, he was a 
skinny kid just hoping to hook on with any college team. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing his 30th birthday, Tonie has been ranked among the top 10 110-meter 
high hurdlers in the world for 11 straight years. He has been victorious at 
almost every large meet, and won a bronze medal in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, 
South Korea. He is currently ranked third in the world, and is a solid bet to 
make the '92 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence has the second-fastest times in the City Section this spring in both 
the 110-meter high hurdles (14.1 seconds) and 300-meter intermediate hurdles 
(39.5). He won both events Thursday in the Southern-Pacific Conference 
championships at Carson, beating rival Curtis Hawkins of Carson in each race. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence, eyeing his first City and state titles, considers Tonie his role 
model and looks to him for support. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have ever thought (my success) would last this long?" laughed Tonie 
the other day in between a workout with Terrence at Banning. "When I first made 
the Olympic team in 1980, I felt on top of the world. I told myself if this was 
the end of my track career I wouldn't be upset because I never expected to get 
this far. Now many, many years later, I still feel the same. This has been the 
best roller-coaster ride of my life." 
</P>
<P>
And that ride has featured plenty of peaks and valleys, much the same course 
Terrence has taken in his young career. The Campbell brothers just never seem 
to take the easy road to success. 
</P>
<P>
Both experimented with a variety of sports and got late starts in track. Both 
have had their share of grade troubles in the classroom, resulting in lengthy 
periods of ineligibility. And there have been the other normal growing-up 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonie went through a period during his teen-age years where he was a little 
rebellious and wanted to do things his own way," said Albert Campbell, the 
boys' father. "He didn't really settle down until he started having some 
success in track and receiving a few pats on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrence is a great kid with a lot of potential, but he just doesn't know what 
he wants to do with his life. All the potential in the world doesn't mean a 
thing if you don't do something with it." 
</P>
<P>
Tonie, who attended USC, nearly had his scholarship revoked after his freshman 
year in 1979 when he posted disappointing times on the track and disappointing 
grades in the classroom. He was academically ineligible his senior season and 
never returned to college. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence missed the first half of track season his sophomore year because of 
grade troubles, and voluntarily sat out the second half of last season to 
concentrate on his studies. 
</P>
<P>
But they have been able to overcome the obstacles through strong family support 
and their desire to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do nothing else in high school track, I want to win City and state in the 
110 hurdles to show everybody that I am capable," said the 6-foot, 160-pound 
Terrence. "I've admired my brother's successes for a long time, and I want to 
make him proud with some championships of my own. It would really mean a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The clearest observation of the two at this point is that Terrence has been 
blessed with more natural athletic ability than Tonie, but he has yet to show 
the same dedication to succeed. Time, they both say, will tell all. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted Terrence to feel like he had to fill my shoes," Tonie said. 
"When he decided to go out for track, I told him to try all the events. The 
fact that he ended up in the hurdles didn't have anything to do with my 
pressuring him. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say, is that if he gets real serious about the sport, it's scary to 
think how far he might go. He definitely has a chance to be better than me." 
</P>
<P>
During high school, Tonie was anxiously looking for a sport to excel in so he 
could earn a college scholarship. He had played football and baseball his whole 
life, but at 5-10 and 145 pounds, he knew he was too small to enjoy a lengthy 
career in those sports. He went out for track as a sophomore and stumbled onto 
the hurdles because he said he was "too slow for the sprints, too weak for the 
long-distance races and hated field events." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the hurdles right away because of my love for flying," Tonie said. 
"Going up over them made me feel like I was a pilot. It has always been a great 
feeling for me." 
</P>
<P>
He ran on the junior varsity as a sophomore and qualified for the City finals 
in the 70-yard high hurdles and 330-yard low hurdles. He moved up to the 
varsity as a junior and qualified for the state meet in the 120-yard highs. 
</P>
<P>
Tonie came into his own as a senior, dueling with his cousin Philip Johnson of 
Gardena to be the top hurdler in Southern California. The two went back and 
forth in victories in the high hurdles all season, but Johnson beat him in the 
City and state finals. Tonie set a personal-best time of 13.81 seconds that 
season, which still stands as the school record, although the race is now run 
in meters instead of yards. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tonie wasn't as well known as his cousin, USC took a chance and 
offered him a scholarship along with Johnson. His freshman year was a disaster 
-- he was the worst of the school's four hurdlers -- and Coach Ken Matsuda 
threatened to revoke his scholar 
</P>
<P>
ship if he didn't get his act together. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer between my freshman and sophomore years was the turning point in my 
life," Tonie said. "I really grew up. Coach Matsuda broke me mentally and 
physically and taught me a lot about life. I trained two times a day and really 
got in shape. I started to accept responsibility. I really wanted to keep my 
scholarship because if I lost it I was headed for a junior college and no 
opportunity to ever achieve all of my goals." 
</P>
<P>
After that summer, Tonie developed a close relationship with Matsuda, who has 
remained his coach to this day. And Tonie went from being the fourth-best 
hurdler on his own team to qualifying for the Olympics in the 110-high hurdles. 
He finished second in the Pac-10 championships and fourth in the NCAA finals. 
He finished third at the Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., with a 13.44. He even 
made the Dean's List with a 3.72 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The United States boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, which is still a sore 
spot with Tonie. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could have earned a medal that year," he said. "It took me a long 
time to get over not having the chance to go. When you're 19 years old, it's 
hard to understand setbacks like that." 
</P>
<P>
Tonie was rated the top high hurdler in the country his junior year, but since 
USC was on probation for using an ineligible athlete, the Trojans weren't 
allowed to compete in the Pac-10 or NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
By this point, Tonie was a world-class athlete and outgrowing his college 
competition. He took a tough course load the fall semester of his senior year 
and was ruled ineligible for track after failing to carry the necessary 
grade-point average. Coach Matsuda redshirted him, but Tonie decided to call it 
quits and devote all his time to training. He has yet to earn a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
But his track career has been a glamorous one. In 1987, he was rated No. 2 in 
the world and has been No. 3 for three years running. Although he is considered 
an old man by track standards, his times continue to get better. He has run a 
13.42 already this year and will travel to several big meets around the world 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I was going to retire after the 1988 Olympics, and here I still am," 
said Tonie, who is now 6-3 and 170 pounds. "Now I figure I will retire after 
the '92 games. But knowing my track record, I'll probably still be around in 
'96." 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Terrence will follow directly in his brother's footsteps. 
For starters, Terrence also plays football and earned a scholarship in that 
sport to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence played football his sophomore year at Banning, but sat out as a junior 
to concentrate on track. He went out for football again this year and played as 
a wide receiver. He admits that football is a game he's loved since he was a 
little kid. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't begin his track career until he was a sophomore, but after years of 
observing Tonie he felt he knew the sport long before he started. He always 
wanted to run the hurdles, he said, because the event is very graceful. 
</P>
<P>
His successes to date have been limited because he has sat out much of the past 
two years, but this season he has lost only one race in the 110 highs. His list 
of victories includes the prestigious Mt. SAC Invitational three weeks ago. And 
with Thursday's conference victories, he appears to be hitting his peak in time 
for the City finals, scheduled May 24 at Birmingham High. Preliminaries begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence, who with 4.4-second speed in the 40-yard dash is considered quick, 
said his goal is to break his brother's school record. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have the ability to do it," he said. "Everyone I know feels I can do 
it. I guess it's just up to me now to prove I can." 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Kem Stumpf has given him plenty of support, but the extra edge is 
being provided by Tonie. The elder brother has been spending many of his 
workouts with Terrence, helping him in any way he can. When he's not there, he 
gives Terrence his workout over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let our age difference fool you," Tonie said. "We're as close as two 
brothers can be. We help each other out and provide pointers. When Terrence 
notices I'm doing something wrong, I welcome his observations. And he looks to 
me for the same advice." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Matsuda, who has closely watched both track careers, said: "Terrence has 
all the tools to be a great one. We're all just waiting on pins and needles to 
see if he does anything with it. It's really in his hands."

ROLLING HILLS CONSIDERS MOVIE-MAKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council is considering adopting an ordinance that would 
prohibit commercial film making in the gated community. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff was ordered Tuesday to prepare a proposed ordinance in the wake 
of recent complaints from residents that the filming of a television movie 
created traffic and noise problems. Residents also complained about filming at 
night in the city, which restricts lighting. One resident said the film 
company, which was filming at a vacant house, cut some vegetation on her 
property to improve the view. 
</P>
<P>
Filming took place over a 10-day period on Eastfield Drive, one of three main 
access roads to the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Terrence Belanger said in a telephone interview that Sapphire 
Productions gained access to the city with a pass issued by the Rolling Hills 
Community Assn., which controls the private streets. Tom Boyd, president of the 
association, said the group was unaware of how much time filming would take 
when it issued the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Belanger said the city, which is entirely residential, does not restrict film 
making but does prohibit other commercial activities. 
</P>
<P>
The ctaff presented an ordinance used by other California cities to restrict 
filming. But rather than adopt that ordinance and possibly add more restrictive 
measures, the council asked the staff to determine whether film making can be 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can stop it, boy, more power to us," Councilwoman Jody Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will report on the proposed ordinance at the next City Council 
meeting Sept. 11.

<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  TIME was Frankie and Johnny were content to be just down-and-dirty lovers.
Today, in the Al Pacino-Michelle Pfeiffer movie carrying their names, they're
New Yawk neurotic, deeply troubled and insecure. We know they'll eventually
collapse into each other's arms, more out of exhaustion than any belief they
are "made for each other." But this won't happen until much soul-searching and
hollow protestations, especially by Frankie.;   "Frankie &amp; Johnny," you see,
is one of those brash "modern" romances that reverses the formula by
demonstrating, in dispiriting detail, why two lonely hearts don't have a
chance at happiness. But then, after pummeling them -- and us -- for two
hours, it reverts to the safe "Happily ever after . . ." fade-out.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  MOVIES; REVIEWS; REVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Unfortunately, "Frankie," directed by the very very hot Garry Marshall
("Pretty Woman"), overdoes it with the tears and hysteria and grandstand
proclamations. By fade-out time, we've had it up to here with both the
principals. We don't care if they split or stay together or embark on a trendy
"open" relationship. Just, please, get them out of our face!;   Taken from
Terrence McNally's off-Broadway play "Frankie and    Johnny in the Clair de
Lune," this off-putting mix of schmaltz and seediness features Pacino as a
recently paroled forger and Pfeiffer as a severely uptight waitress whose past
relationships have left her wary of men. It's been three years since her last
lover and Frankie has finally talked herself into enjoying the solitude.;  
Besides, who needs company when you can apply the Heimlich maneuver to
yourself? Or when there are vicarious thrills to be had by watching, a la
Jimmy Stewart in "Rear Window," the hard-luck cases across the courtyard?;  
Johnny, of course, has other ideas. The new short-order cook at Nick's Apollo
Cafe, where Frankie waitresses and ministers to the needs of ancient regulars,
Johnny pursues Frankie with the single-mindedness of a Sidewinder Missile.
First by asking her out. Then by sleeping with a fellow waitress (Kate
Nelligan) he knows will spill her guts to co-workers the morning after. And
then by showing up at her apartment unannounced.;   Talk about sexual
harassment.;   This being a coarse-but-heartwarming street fable, Frankie
finally acquiesces to the guy she finds sort of cute, but overbearing.;   But
then the old fears resurface and she retreats. Johnny's response: to come on
even stronger, crashing Frankie's bowling night, phoning non-stop . . .
stressing how the fates have decreed they live out their tawdry lives
together. After all, their names are Frankie and Johnny; they're both from
Altoona, Pa.; they both swoon to late-night Muzak renditions of Debussy.;  
"Frankie" isn't a hard-luck romance, it's a horror story -- every woman's
worst nightmare.;   It's also phony from the word go. Marshall, who cut his
teeth (and made his fortune) on prime-time sitcoms, here offers a grating,
R-rated spin on his "Laverne &amp; Shirley." (Series star Penny Marshall, Garry's
sister, even has a Port Authority cameo.) Every New York cliche known to man
-- and Neil Simon -- has been packed into this film. We get the hateful
pedestrian, the fender-bender combatants, the insulting uptown patrons, the
noisy but protective gay neighbor (a relatively understated Nathan Lane), the
gleefully sadistic waitresses. Marshall's Big Apple is more than rotten; it's
one big crime scene.;   This setting, of course, is supposed to balance out
the inherent corniness of McNally's urban fable. It might if we felt the
principals grew out of their grim milieu. They don't. And we don't. Which
accounts for why everyone overacts so ferociously.;   The usually terrific
Nelligan ("Eye of the Needle") is particularly hard to take. Her waitress Cora
was obviously modeled after Diane Ladd's Flo in "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore." The big difference: Flo was loud and full of heart while Cora is
just obscene and full of it. Her character -- and the other pushy but pathetic
types at Nick's -- are meant to place the star lovers in some kind of context.
Thanks to Marshall's ham-handed direction, they come off looking pitiful, like
so many drowned rats.;   As for Pacino and Pfeiffer, they have their moments
but are never really convincing. Pacino in grease-splattered apron and
bandanna is just Michael Corleone in the Witness Relocation Program. He's too
much the live wire to stoop to the desperate "little guy" -- his early
apprenticeship in "Panic in Needle Park" and "Scarecrow" notwithstanding.
Pfeiffer, even made up to look drawn and pale for the early scenes, is
blindingly beautiful. She's about as believable as something the cat dragged
in as Garbo at the Tri-City Bowl-a-rama.;   Think of "Frankie &amp; Johnny" as an
early Halloween offering and gasp accordingly.; Frankie &amp; Johnny; (star) 1/2;

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Wendy (Alison Steadman), comforts one of her twin daughters,
Nicola, (Jane Horrocks) in Mike Leigh's comedy, 'Life Is Sweet.'  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; CELEBRITY; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE cheery, we'll-muddle-through mother has been a fixture of British
melodramas since the war years. The prototypical home-front mum was played by
Greer Garson in MGM's "Mrs. Miniver"; John Boorman's "Hope and Glory" and
Peter Medak's "The Krays" offered richer, darker variations in the person of
Sarah Miles and Billy Whitelaw.;   And now you can add Alison Steadman's name
to the honor roll of English mums who toil, scrimp and sacrifice out of the
goodness of their hearts. Steadman's Wendy is the chipper, easily amused
Middlesex mother in Mike Leigh's aptly titled "Life Is Sweet" (now playing).  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LIFE LOOKS SWEET FOR BRIT ACTRESS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     At first, she appears flighty, a maddening airhead straight out of some
dumb British sitcom; but when things take a turn for the worse and the
family's undercurrent of desperation is revealed, she blossoms into a heroine
every bit as resourceful and strong as Mrs. Miniver.;   Steadman, on the phone
from London, describes Wendy as "silly and irritating" but "the backbone of
the family." First impressions, the actress adds, are definitely misleading in
the case of this woman.;   Wrong impressions;   "Very often when we first meet
people, we get an impression that is often the wrong impression," says the
45-year-old Steadman, who, with husband Leigh, has two sons. "At first Wendy
is quite annoying, but with a buoyant sense of humor. As more is revealed, the
audience begins to see Wendy as a three-dimensional character, a survivor.";  
Much the same could be said of actress Steadman, a household name in England
but virtually unknown on these shores, save for her work in TV's "The Singing
Detective" and the movie "Shirley Valentine" (she played Jane, the best friend
who invites Pauline Collins on a getaway to Greece, then abandons her).;  
With "Life Is Sweet" now seducing art-house audiences, this could change.
Critics on both sides of the big pond are saying Oscar ought to take a closer
look and recognize Steadman in the best-actress category.;   Steadman has
heard such talk, but dismisses it as kind but farfetched. "The Guardian
(newspaper in London) wrote, 'If we were living in fairer times, Steadman's
performance would be considered for an Oscar.' It's quite flattering when
someone says that, but we're so low-budget it's unlikely we'll be
remembered.";   Like Leigh's other social satires ("High Hopes," "Abigail's
Party"), "Life Is Sweet" was developed during a four-month rehearsal session
in which the cast was encouraged to research and create their characters from
scratch. Steadman refuses to divulge her model, but will say she never saw
Wendy as a heroine. That side of her emerged in the finished film.;   "When I
saw the film, I was quite moved by Wendy. I thought she said a lot about women
who do cope with a helluva lot in life. Women are still being left to look
after the kids and keep things going while men duck out and quickly move on to
new relationships. That hasn't changed.";   Though "Life Is Sweet" is far more
naturalistic than, say, something like "Shirley Valentine," it still offers a
view of lower middle-class life that some may find sugar-coated. Feminist
critics have been known to sharpen their incisors on happy-go-lucky characters
like Wendy. Steadman agrees, but points to Leigh's latest as a "refreshing
alternative" to Britain's harsher depictions of family life, found in "The
Krays" and especially Terrence Davis' "Distant Voices, Still Lives.";   Hardly
ideal family;   "I don't think it ('Life') is a terribly romantic film," she
politely avers. "This is not exactly the ideal family. It's fraught with
problems. One daughter is a butch plumber; the other is anorexic. These are
not the kids that, ideally, Andy (Jim Broadbent) and Wendy would have
wanted.";   Still, the film emphasizes the positive and leaves one in an "up"
mood. "We haven't heard from the feminist lobby about this film. Most of the
crits (reviews) have been rejoicing in the warm relationship. Wendy is a
fighter, and the audience gets a buzz from seeing a survivor. Instead of
giving up on the whole situation, she soars above it, and in the end kind of
wins.";   From what Steadman can tell, the public is tired of being preached
to. "They're fed up with feminists with no humor . . . with the kind of
somber, humorless feminist dramas. People in general, I think, are sick of
this.";   Steadman next will play opposite Dudley Moore and Patsy Kensit in
Disney's "Blame It on the Bellboy," a mistaken-identity farce set in Venice,
Italy. This comedy is due in England in January, stateside in March. Steadman
describes it as "good fun . . . very light and funny. It's basically about a
hit man and a husband who's off for a dirty weekend, but winds up with the
wrong girl. I'm the wife who chases after him.";   As for Steadman appearing
in her husband's next ensemble piece, that remains to be seen. Leigh doesn't
discuss his works-in-progress because there's nothing to discuss. He doesn't
know what shape they'll take until he confers with his cast. "I'd love to be
in it, but it depends on if he asks me. He doesn't go round the house chatting
about it.";   You can bet it won't be a sequel to "Life Is Sweet" or some
Hollywood variation. "Hollywood wants to be in control. They say, 'Here's a
million dollars, it's got be about this. You've got to make a film about X, Y
and Zed. Mike likes to start from a completely blank sheet. So he can't tell a
producer what his film is going to be about. It's not his thing. He's never
compromised. He's one of the few people in this business who has stuck to his
principle."  </TEXT>

   Home video distributors have many ways of
peddling their wares to movie enthusiasts who normally only go to
the video store to rent or buy the blockbusters or the hot movie of
the month.
   It called packaging _ and that's with a capital ``P.''
   While home video fans will flock to fetch Steven Spielberg's
``Empire of the Sun'' when Warner Home Video releases it on Aug.
10, many will find it difficult to rent, with long waiting lists.
Others might be lured by older and less popular movies.
   HBO Video has a summer sales program it calls ``Video Thrills,''
featuring 11 of its top action movies. They include ``Psych-Out,''
starring Jack Nicholson; ``Let's Get Harry,'' with Mark Harmon and
Robert Duvall; and ``Wild in the Streets,'' starring Richard Pryor
and Christopher Jones. The movies retail for $19.99.
   ``We've designed this promotion to appeal to the consumer's
desire for action-adventure titles during the summer months,'' said
Tracy Dolgin, a marketing vice president at HBO.
   Warner also has an action series called ``Heroes.'' The movies
retail at $19.98 and include ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' ``The Road
Warrior'' and ``Sharky's Machine.''
   Paramount Home Video has ``Double Play'' _ two movies for
$19.95. Audrey Hepburn stars in ``Sabrina'' and ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's.'' Cary Grant is featured in ``Houseboat'' and ``To Catch
a Thief.'' There's also ``Up in Smoke'' and ``Cheech &amp; Chong'' and
``A Place in the Sun'' with ``Sunset Boulevard.''
   Virgin Vision offers a ``Freedom of Choice'' promotion in July
in which consumers may purchase one feature for $79.95 and get a
second for $14.95. Titles include: ``Man Outside'' with ``House of
Death''; ``Car Trouble'' with ``Midnite Spares''; and ``Ping Pong''
with ``Cry of the Innocent.''
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Orphans,'' ``Prick Up Your Ears''
and ``Wall Street.''

   ``Orphans'' (Lorimar Home Video, VHS-Beta: $79.95, Rated R)
   
   The comical mugging that opens the 1987 film ``Orphans''
indicates the dark humor to follow, but does nothing to prepare you
for the flip side _ the frightened, frightening relationship
between the hotheaded mugger and his younger brother, orphans who
keep out the world in a big decaying house in Newark, N.J.
   The actors in Alan J. Pakula's movie _ Albert Finney, Matthew
Modine and Kevin Anderson _ turn out stunning performances in a
play-like movie based on Lyle Kessler's award-winning stage drama.
   The older brother (Modine) builds a cocoon, venturing out to
make a living mugging and stealing and virtually imprisoning his
brother (Anderson) by telling him he will have an allergic reaction
and die if he goes outdoors.
   Into their violent, unreal world comes a staggeringly drunk
gangster on the run (Finney), himself an orphan and able in a flash
to dissect the complicated relationship he finds in the brothers'
littered house.
   The story is implausible but it doesn't matter much as you watch
what inevitably follows the disarming gangster's intrusion into the
orphans' lives. Modine's character, who believes he's abducted the
gangster and intends to hold him for ransom, sums it up when he
says, ``He's taking over. ... He's supposed to be a kidnap victim.''

   ``Prick Up Your Ears'' (Virgin Vision, VHS-Beta: $79.95, Rated R)
   
   A story of talent and torment, ``Prick Up Your Ears'' tells the
real-life story of British playwright Joe Orton's rise from a
working class background, to the heights of success, to a brutal
end.
   Orton (Gary Oldman) was a raw talent with a lust for life who
studied drama in London. There, he met Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred
Molina), a more cultured writer who becomes his homosexual lover.
   The two lead a closet existence before they're jailed in
different prisons for defacing library books. Orton uses the
separation to grow on his own, becoming one of the brightest
talents in London after his release.
   His career skyrockets when he connects with high-powered agent
Peggy Ramsay (Vanessa Redgrave). She nurtures his talents,
arranging for him to meet Paul McCartney for a screenplay about The
Beatles.
   Success drives the wedge deeper between Orton and his jealous
roommate, Halliwell, a psychotic whose mother died of a wasp sting
when he was a child and whose father committed suicide. Halliwell
is being left behind, covering his disappointment as clumsily as he
covers his bald head with an ill-fitting wig. The emotions boil
over to dark rage.
   To make sure he doesn't lose his lover, Halliwell hammers him to
death in a grisly scene, then takes his own life.
   The 111-minute video is rated R, mainly for homosexual love
scenes and shadowy men's room sex.
   _ By Robert Dvorchak, AP National Writer.

   ``Wall Street'' (CBS-Fox, VHS-Beta: $89.98, Rated R)
   
   When ``Wall Street'' hit movie theaters last year, the real
street was crashing and high-rolling traders such as Ivan Boesky
were being marched to prison.
   Anyone who thinks this movie offers any real insight into the
quirks and greed that make stock market life so enticing will be
disappointed.
   One of the many implausible aspects of this film written and
directed by Oliver Stone is that there isn't a single decent
woman's role. It could be that the film is implicitly blaming
testosterone for Wall Street's vices.
   But who cares? This movie is great silly fun, fueled by superb
acting from Oscar winner Michael Douglas, father and son Martin and
Charlie Sheen, Hal Holbrook and Terrence Stamp. There's even a
terrific walk-on by Sylvia Miles as a pushy East Side real estate
saleswoman.
   Douglas is suitably sinister as Gordon Gekko, Wall Street
dealmaker, dream-weaver and crusher of innocent companies. The
younger Sheen plays Bud Fox, a young Sammy Glick-type broker who
sees Gekko as his ticket to the big bucks. He will do anything to
get into Gekko's empire of beautiful women, limousines, cocaine and
mega-deals.
   While at Gekko's beach house he meets a beautiful but vacuous
interior decorator played (Darryl Hannah) who has big money dreams
of her own. Fidelity, it turns out, is not her strong suit _ nor
are brains.
   Gekko spins out such wisdom as ``greed is good,'' and ``every
battle is won before it is fought.''
   Fox ingratiates himself to Gekko by becoming a corporate spy and
feeding him insider information.
   But when he finds himself embroiled in a take-over scheme that
threatens to break up the airline for which his father works, this
proves too much even for the avaricious young Fox.

<P>
The other day Terrence McNally had to take part in "a book-signing thing" at 
the Drama Book Shop. When he saw all his plays laid out on the table, he 
realized that he had been in the theater for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than depress him, this struck him as an achievement. Terrence McNally 
likes the theater. He likes himself when he's working in it. He is glad that he 
managed to hang in there. 
</P>
<P>
McNally's new play, "Up in Saratoga" (opening Thursday at the Old Globe 
Theatre) is his 30th or so script. Some have been hits: "Next" (1969), "The 
Ritz" ('75), "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" ('88). 
</P>
<P>
And some have been flops. There was McNally's very first play in 1965, "And 
Things That Go Bump in the Night." This ended with one of the characters being 
chased into an electric fence, a theme that several of the New York critics had 
fun with the next morning. "Two of them called for my death," McNally recalled 
the other day in his Village apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this isn't a bad way for a playwright to be introduced to the theater. It 
certainly avoids false illusions. The trick, of course, is to survive the 
initiation. McNally did, thanks to his producer, Ted Mann. 
</P>
<P>
"We had come in under budget, so Ted decided to cut the ticket prices to $2 and 
$3 and keep the show open for two-and-a-half weeks. The reviews were so bad we 
didn't know if anyone would come, even at those prices. But we sold out every 
night and the show was wildly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"So I had my two-and-a-half weeks of feeling like a playwright. There were 
people going bravo after the show. There were people who were moved by my 
writing. If Ted had closed the show in one day, I don't know if I could have 
lived with that. I don't know if I could have gone on being a playwright." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McNally says, "I've had enormous ups and downs. There have been 
years when I've felt that I couldn't do it anymore, financially. But I've never 
lost my enthusiasm for the theater, and I've always been able to get my plays 
done, in some fashion." 
</P>
<P>
He never writes the same play twice. Many of them are funny; some tenderly so, 
like "Frankie and Johnny." But he has a dark, grotesque side, as in a new 
script, "The Lisbon Traviata." In another mood, he will tackle the book of 
musicals -- "The Rink" (a flop a few seasons back) or Harold Prince's planned 
new version of "Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird thing about my career. I do one thing and then I do something 
else. After 'The Ritz,' everybody expected me to write farce. After 'It's Only 
a Play," they expected me to write drawing-room comedies. Now with 'Frankie and 
Johnny" everybody expects me to write blue-collar romance. 
</P>
<P>
"You could argue that any writer's really just trying to write the same play 
over and over. First as a comedy; then as a musical; then as a tragedy. I don't 
know. I just think it's fun to work in all these forms. When I see a bare 
stage, I want to write for that." 
</P>
<P>
"Up in Saratoga" is another departure for McNally: a period piece. It's based 
on Bronson Howard's "Saratoga," a high-society costume drama from the 1870s. 
When Broadway producer Liz McCann gave it to McNally to read, with the thought 
that he might adapt it, he found it "You just want people to see your work." 
</P>
<P>
charming but creaky. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply adapt Howard's original, McNally has remodeled it into "a 
play by me, that I hope is respectful of the period; that I hope will make you 
believe that you're in the 19th Century for two and a half hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of fun writing it. I liked creating a language where you can't use 
gutter talk or slang. Also, if you were going to give people a sense of the 
theater of that day, there had to be lots of subplots, a lot of loose ends to 
tie up. Plays with 25 people shouldn't be short. 
</P>
<P>
"Bronson Howard's name will always be on it, along with mine, but if it doesn't 
work, I'm afraid I'll have to take full responsibility. I'm optimistic, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
McNally approaches his trade like a craftsman. "I never think of myself as 
writing literature. I'm more like an architect who is creating a blueprint, on 
which people will put up something that will stand. They can have bathrooms and 
bedrooms and access from floor to floor. It's all very practical. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, writing the play is only 50% of the experience. You write that first 
draft by yourself. But 'Frankie and Johnny' isn't what's on the page, it's what 
will happen in the theater. So you need actors and a director. They inspire me. 
They delight me." 
</P>
<P>
The whole theater process delights him. McNally has written for the screen 
(he's adapting "Frankie and Johnny" for Paramount right now) but he's happiest 
while rehearsing a new show. "Theater is like -- a friend. Not a parent figure, 
but a friend. I think theater brings out the best in people. I know I'm a nicer 
guy when I'm in rehearsal. More trusting. More open. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, there's a horrible side of me that the theater also brings out. Like 
when I get a bad review, or when someone turns a play down. But when things are 
going well in rehearsal, with all the actors giving so much, I'm reminded of 
the nicest times in my life, back in high school -- before I got competitive 
with people." 
</P>
<P>
McNally went to high school in Corpus Christi, Tex., after which he came to New 
York to major in English at Columbia. In his senior year he wrote the Varsity 
Show, and that started his involvement with theater. 
</P>
<P>
The next step was a $40 a week gofer-ship with the Actors Studio, where he 
studied everybody from Geraldine Paige to Marilyn Monroe, and where he learned 
that he couldn't act -- perhaps the reason he has always admired actors so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years, McNally remains young in his love for theater, catching every 
show at a late preview, so that he won't be corrupted by the critics, and up on 
all the gossip. He also knows more about opera than most music critics, as he 
regularly demonstrates on the Metropolitan Opera quiz. 
</P>
<P>
He's a New Yorker to the soul -- but disenchanted with the alienation he sees 
around him, the kids with their earphones, the adults buying their videos for 
another lonely Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankie and Johnny" was a reaction to that mood. McNally had been in India, 
where he found people actually paying attention to each other. He wanted to 
write a play showing that it could happen in Manhattan, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, that miracle. You think, I've had my two divorces or three bad 
relationships (he is unmarried), and I'm not gonna get involved again . . . and 
then this miracle happens. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might be a play that would only interest people in their 40s and 
50s, but we got the college kids and the little old ladies, and they all 
responded to it. 
</P>
<P>
"No way will 'Lisbon Traviata' be as popular as 'Frankie and Johnny.' It's very 
violent. But we've had a little production of it in New York, and a lot of 
people liked it, and a lot of people had criticisms of it. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's all right. I mean, I don't love everything I write. Playwrights are 
aware of the flaws in their work. They just can't fix 'em. If they could, they 
would. You don't expect everything to run forever. 
</P>
<P>
'You just want people to see your work'.

The bounty of Sonoma and the diversity of its products are limitless. We pride 
ourselves on being able to achieve the epitome of the art of living. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOY STERLING, 
</P>
<P>
Iron Horse Vineyards 
</P>
<P>
A black stretch limo zooms past plush vineyards, then turns up a winding road 
toward a replica of a French chateau: Jordan Winery. The passengers are heading 
to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Airport limousines carrying wine trade pilgrims -- wine buyers, distributors, 
visiting winemakers from around the world -- are commonplace in the Napa and 
Sonoma Valleys. So too, these days, is the growing number of winery chefs. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bowman, Jordan's hospitality director and vineyard host, recalls that 
as recently as three years ago only six wineries had resident chefs. Today the 
number has probably tripled. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes business sense," says Bowman. "The table is the best environment to 
appreciate wine, whether you do it at home for your own enjoyment or at a 
winery for business." 
</P>
<P>
Beringer Vineyards was among the first large wineries to see the business 
sense. It started a professional chef's program in 1979 (Robert Mondavi Winery 
had installed a culinary program in 1976) which later showcased nationally and 
internationally renowned chefs. Beringer public relations director Antonia 
Allegra points out that as wineries merge with large corporations (Sterling 
Vineyards and Domaine Mumm have joined Seagram's, for instance; Inglenook, 
Beaulieu and Christian Brothers have been purchased by Heublein), the job of 
entertaining winery guests has become more of a business than a home 
entertainment event. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Cakebread still performs the cooking duties at Cakebread Cellars, with 
the help of professionals, but she is an exception. Today the wife of the owner 
is less likely to play cook than co-host. "Most see their role as a business 
partners rather than cooks," says Allegra. When it comes to cooking, wineries 
will look around for a chef to match their style. 
</P>
<P>
Iron Horse Vineyards snapped up Mark Malicki right after he sold Truffles, a 
trend-setting restaurant in Sonoma County. His creativity, Culinary Institute 
of America (CIA) training and experience at New York's River Cafe where what 
owners Barry and Audrey Sterling were looking for. They like to entertain 
artists and writers as well as people in the wine trade. 
</P>
<P>
For a dinner honoring architect Frank Gehry, he created an entree which was a 
culinary interpretation of the artist's sculpture. When Barry Sterling wanted 
something "thoroughly American" after an austere trip to China, Malicki 
answered the request by drawing a straight line from Nanking to the United 
States, landing in Savannah. It was a regional Savannah menu he served. 
</P>
<P>
Malicki is an advocate of healthful, low-cholesterol essences, or "infusions," 
as they are sometimes called. His essences are derived from olive oil produced 
on the property for private use, flavored with herbs, seeds and vegetables. 
"The oil-based essences are a great substitute for cream and butter and they 
are very versatile," says Malicki. 
</P>
<P>
He uses the essences to baste meat, poultry, fish, shrimp or other shellfish, 
salads and vegetables. Fruit essences made with peanut or almond paste and 
fruit juices are used as sauces for desserts. 
</P>
<P>
The Iron Horse gardens, Jeffersonian in scope and character, are a source for 
Malicki's inspiration. In sawed-off wine barrels perched along the roadside 
leading to the farmhouse grow 32 different species of tomatoes, hybrid 
lettuces, squashes, artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, fava beans and leeks, as 
well as countless herbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterlings, Malicki and co-owner Forrest Tancer function as a team of wine 
and food tasters. They have discovered that eggs, especially omelets, go well 
with sparkling wines. "Avocado, as in guacamole, is also terrific with 
sparkling wine," says marketing director Joy Sterling, who adds that coconut 
cream with sparkling wine is another knockout combo. 
</P>
<P>
Other successes with sparkling wine are oily fish, ginger, shellfish and 
chicken. Thumbs down foods? Fruit, cheese and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Vineyard and Winery, founded in 1972, not only looks like a traditional 
French chateau but is unmistakably organized like one. The 32-seat oak dining 
table is laid with French royal blue china and decorated with masses of 
magnificent pastel hybrid roses grown on the property. (Roses are traditionally 
planted along fences of vineyards to color-code wine grapes; red for red wines, 
yellow and white for white wines). 
</P>
<P>
Guests of the winery sit down to a meal cooked by Brooklyn-born, French-trained 
John Caputo, and his assistant, Jean Reynolds, who also apprenticed in top 
restaurants in France. A typical lunch menu might include seafood salad with 
couscous and mint, served with a smooth 1987 Jordan Chardonnay. Grilled chicken 
served on a bed of corn and asparagus would be accompanied by a 1986 Cabernet 
Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's guidelines to wine and food pairing emphasize the simple idea of 
harmony between the food eaten and the wines served. The soft, rich elegant 
Jordan wines are meant to complement rather than overpower the food. "Our 
philosophy of matching food and wine is one of creating a partnership of 
flavors between the two," says Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
Some general rules followed at Jordan include serving "white wine before red, 
young before old, lesser before greater, and dry before sweet." However, Caputo 
warns against over-analyzing food and wine. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the romance out of it. We're not scientists, we're cooks and chefs. 
The part we enjoy is the unscientific aspect." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Danko is the resident chef at Chateau Souverain and executive chef of its 
restaurant. Like several other wine country chefs, he is a protege of author 
and teacher Madeleine Kamman. (See story on Madeleine Kamman, p. 21.) He would 
pair smooth-textured avocado with Chardonnay, oysters with acidic Sauvignon 
Blanc. "It has the same effect you find as when you team port with Stilton," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He has found that Sauvignon Blanc goes well with smoked fish and Fume Blanc 
with roasted peppers. Veal is particularly suited to white wine, and red wines 
become flavorful when teamed with roasted red meats, bacon and even red beets. 
</P>
<P>
Cottage industries that started with the hippies of the early '70s have helped 
Sonoma come into its own as an important food center, says Danko. "There is a 
thriving oyster industry,and Sonoma has become the poultry capital. The county 
also produces some of the best goat cheese and lamb in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just beginning to appreciate the land and what it offers. The 
county has the best of everything. Chardonnays in Sonoma are some of the finest 
and the Pinot Noir resembles those of Provence and Normandy." 
</P>
<P>
With such offerings a chef's scope is unlimited. "We use what we feel will 
balance food with wine," says Danko. "Much of what we do is dictated by the 
land. It's like letting the environment take over the body." 
</P>
<P>
Health concerns in cooking have also influenced Danko's direction in cooking. 
"We take the fat off everything now," he says. They have also led him to create 
meat essences for flavoring sauces by cooking down beef, veal and lamb, game 
birds without fat. He uses a less fatty and less heavy demiglace, originally 
described by Escoffier and resurrected by Madeleine Kamman. 
</P>
<P>
CIA graduate Stephen Benson, who perfected his skills at La Costa Hotel and Spa 
in Carlsbad, Mille Fleurs in Rancho Santa Fe and other Napa Valley restaurants, 
prepares meals for Cain Cellars owners Joyce and Jerry Cain and also for winery 
events and private parties. 
</P>
<P>
The California native brings much of his German heritage into his cooking: 
braised red cabbage, light sauces and reductions. Wine from the 552-acre Cain 
property provides the inspiration when Benson cooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvignon Blanc, for instance, suggests sipping with appetizers. Chardonnays 
are paired with first course dishes such as crab cakes, buttery seafood dishes 
and creamy sauces. Meat or poultry entrees might call for red wine, especially 
when fruit, such as black currants, and pepper are used in the meat sauce. 
"Pepper brings out wine wonderfully," Benson says. 
</P>
<P>
Benson enjoys using ingredients from local farmers, such as Peter Forni and 
Lynn Brown, who operate a small farm in Napa and specialize in 40 varieties of 
hybrid lettuces supplying many local chefs. Much of their produce is also 
air-shipped to top restaurants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
So dedicated are some chefs to the art of food and wine pairing, they have 
developed their own principles. Beringer's Patricia Windisch has made a 
scientific study of the art of "pairing" and concluded that acid in food should 
be kept just below the acid level in the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"When using a Chardonnay that seems acidic and a chicken or seafood dish is 
being served," she wrote in her research paper, "Secrets of a Winery Chef," 
"add an acid to the sauce in the form of lemon, lime, balsamic vinegar or 
reduced wine. That touch of acid in the dish will soften the acidic quality of 
the wine; conversely, when the wine seems low in acid, a creamy sauce that is 
high in lactose (sugar) and more alkaline in character will help raise the 
acidic perception of the wine." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, in a meal created for a designer's show house luncheon Windisch 
paired macerated melon and berries with Late Harvest Johannisberg riesling, a 
rather sweet and fruity wine. 
</P>
<P>
Napa's century-old Inglenook Vineyard, tucked in a "nook" of the Rutherford 
Hills, first installed a resident chef in 1980. After a competition involving 
more than 60 candidates, the job went to Jamie Morningstar, a CCA graduate and, 
by coincidence, a great-granddaughter of Gustave Niebaum, Inglenook's 19th 
century founder. She prepares special meals for guests of the winery, holds 
classes in matching of food and wine, and travels widely to showcase the 
Hueblein-owned Inglenook estate bottled wines (not to be confused with 
Inglenook jug wines). 
</P>
<P>
"I have found," she says, "that matching acidic wine with acidic foods tends to 
have a neutralizing effect. A Sauvignon Blanc, for instance, which is acidic, 
plays well with bold flavors of salsas and other fiery foods. Chardonnays, 
which are less acidic, find harmony when paired with pastas and rich, creamy 
sauces." 
</P>
<P>
For a dish of chicken topped with a herb butter, Morningstar selected 1985 
Cabernet Sauvignon from the Inglenook-Napa Valley. With strawberries macerated 
in liqueur she served 1986 Late Harvest Gewurztraminer, to match the sweetness 
of the strawberries and liqueur at harmonious levels with the wine. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Velardi, a graduate of the California Culinary Academy (CCA) in San 
Francisco, was resident chef for the officers on a Sagafjord-Cunard Lines 
Alaska cruise before joining Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves four years ago. In 
keeping with Gloria Ferrer's Spanish origins (the parent company is Freixenet, 
a leading producer of methode champenoise sparkling wine in Spain), Velardi 
serves tapas on the winery patios each Sunday. She also prepares meals for 
visitors in the wine trade. The winery is also open to privately catered events 
and weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of staff winery chefs is becoming so fashionable that neighbors hardly 
can keep up with growing numbers. Few wine country residents, for instance, 
could tell you that the small (20,000 case) Frog's Leap Winery now boasts a 
resident chef. True, Bev Salinger also handles office duties, but the CCA 
graduate is still called upon several times a week to entertain private guests 
of the owners, Larry Turley and John and Julie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Frog's Leap sits back from the road in rustic surroundings that suggest the 
romantic countrified rompings of a modern Marie Antoinette, undistinguished but 
for the bright green mail box that identifies the winery to 
"by-appointment-only visitors." A babbling brook behind the main house shimmers 
in the midday sun streaming through lacy oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The air is filled by the aroma of huge Washington State oysters barbecuing on 
the grill. The oysters, purchased at Johnson's Oyster Farm at Point Reyes in 
nearby Marin County were specifically selected to complement the 1986 Sauvignon 
Blanc being served. 
</P>
<P>
Salinger, who worked for 10 years at Domaine Chandon before joining Frog's 
Leap, believes that some portion of the wine appearing in the food should be 
the one served with the food. A Cabernet Sauvignon used in a sauce for lamb 
would also appear on the table as the wine of choice. A strawberry coulis 
served with chocolate might contain a touch of Zinfandel, which also 
complements chocolate desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the recipes and menus with wine suggestions derived from the 
Napa-Sonoma chefs.

<DESCRIPT>  JUVENILE; MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  JUDGING by the enthusiastic couples at a recent screening of "Frankie &amp;
Johnny" -- wisely released amid thrillers and violent action pictures -- this
undoubtedly will be the date movie of the season.;   Producer-director Garry
("Pretty Woman") Marshall's latest entry is a feel-good picture, to be sure,
but a dream that's just too good to be true.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LOVE ON WRY, WITH MUSTARD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Teen Review; Peter Canavese, 17, is a senior at Bellarmine College Preparatory.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The film is based on "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," a quiet,
off-Broadway stage hit by Terrence McNally, who also wrote the film. The story
concerns Frankie (Michelle Pfeiffer), a lonely waitress, and Johnny (Al
Pacino), an ex-con. Frankie and Johnny (yes, the song is referred to
constantly) meet at the Apollo Cafe in New York, where Frankie works. Johnny
strides in and applies for the position of short-order cook and before you can
say meatloaf, he has disarmed the joint -- with the notable exception of
Frankie.;   See where this is going? Before long, Johnny is pursuing Frankie
like a rabid squirrel.;   Wisely, the film divides its time between the
marathon arguments and assignations of Pacino and Pfeiffer and the comic
relief of the knockout supporting cast.;   Particular standouts are Nathan
Lane as Frankie's relentlessly funny gay neighbor and best friend, Tim; Hector
Elizondo as the cafe's proprietor, Nick; Kate Nelligan as the brassy but
lonely waitress Cora; and Jane Morris, whose performance as the mousy waitress
Nedda is uproarious.;   Marshall's mistake is in trying to make us believe we
truly know these characters; he spends the picture holding every character up
to the principals. Similarly, a series of heavy-handed scenes (lifted
shamelessly from "Rear Window") is inconsistent and muddled.;   That being
said, "Frankie &amp; Johnny" is at its best in the face-offs between Pacino and
Pfeiffer. That they are stars works against their attempts at realism, but
they overcome this hurdle.;   Pfeiffer is too glamorous for the role, written
for Oscar-winning Kathy Bates, but she quickly makes the audience forget that
with a carefully orchestrated performance. Pacino is pure charm, and despite
being pushy and overbearing at times, his expressive eyes betray his motives
as genuine. You gotta love this guy.;   Marshall's days as a sitcom king
("Laverne and Shirley") are evident; the methods and the plot are familiar.
But "Frankie &amp; Johnny" doesn't disappoint. Since it bypasses the brain and
shoots directly at baser instincts, the film likely will get the better of
many cynics who go in prepared to hate it.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>British Hostage's Brother Appeals For His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of British hostage John
McCarthy appealed today to his captors to release McCarthy before
his ailing mother dies.
   The Arabic-language statement was issued in Beirut and signed by
McCarthy's brother Terrence.
   ``I plead with you in the name of mercy and justice for which
Islam is known, to fulfill the wish of an ailing woman to see her
son before she dies,'' the statement said.
   The Beirut office of the London-based Worldwide Television News
network distributed the appeal.
   McCarthy, a journalist, was working for WTN when he was kidnapped
April 17, 1986, as he was being driven to Beirut airport to catch a
flight to London.
   It was the fourth such appeal in two weeks. McCarthy's father,
Pat, pleaded for McCarthy's release on June 20, saying the captive's
mother, Sheila, was ``gravely ill in hospital.''
   ``She is dying in one of London's hospitals. Bring back John for
her so that she departs this life peacefully,'' Terrence McCarthy's
appeal said.
   ``Please bring back the smile to the face of the McCarthy family
at this critical period. Please release John,'' it concluded.
   McCarthy, 32, is one of 14 foreigners held captive in Lebanon.
   His brother's message did not name any of the Moslem extremist
groups holding hostages, because none has claimed to hold McCarthy.
   Nine Americans are among those held. The hostage held longest is
American journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Florida's Supreme Court reversed the
conviction of a death row inmate Thursday and ordered his fourth
trial in the murders of three adults and two children.
   In a 4-3 ruling, the court said Douglas Jackson deserved another
trial because the prosecutor in his third trial improperly
questioned him about his conviction in the first trial.
   The first verdict was overturned because his defense attorney was
taking medication for a head injury during the trial. Jackson's
second trial ended in mistrial.
   Jackson was convicted in his latest trial of killing Walter
Washington, 25; his wife Edna, 21; Larry Finney, 26; and Terrence
and Reginald Manuel in March 1981. Their bodies were found in the
charred hulk of an car on a remote stretch of road.
   The three adults died of shotgun wounds. Terrence, 4, and
Reginald, 14 months, Mrs. Washington's sons, died of smoke
inhalation.
   The killings occurred after Jackson's estranged wife, Karen,
quarreled with him and left home to live with the victims.
   ``The prejudicial effect upon a jury of testimony that a
defendant has been previously convicted of the crimes for which he
is now on trial is so damaging that it cannot be said beyond a
reasonable doubt that a jury would return a verdict of guilty absent
the testimony,'' the court's majority opinion said.
   But Justice Stephen H. Grimes argued that the cross-examination
remark was ``harmless error.''
   ``Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the jury was
already aware that this was not Jackson's first trial,'' Grimes said
in his dissenting opinion.

<HEAD>Author Terrence Smith Dies In Traffic Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrence Lore Smith, author of the
best-selling novel ``The Thief Who Came To Dinner,'' was killed in a
traffic accident on an icy road. He was 46.
   Smith, who died Wednesday, wrote eight mystery novels. The most
famous, ``The Thief Who Came To Dinner,'' was completed in 1969 and
was published by Doubleday and Pocket Books. It reached No. 7 on a
national best-seller list and was made into a movie that starred
Ryan O'Neill.
   He also wrote ``The Looking Glass Murders,'' ``Murder Behind
Closed Doors,'' ``Yours Truly, From Hell,'' ``The Money War,'' ``The
Devil and Webster Daniels,'' ``Grownups and Lovers,'' and ``Who
Killed the Pie Man?''
   He co-authored ``Different Drums'' with his father, Charles
Merrill Smith, who died in February 1985.
   Smith was born Oct. 27, 1942, in Freeport, Ill. He lived in
Bloomington, Ill., until he moved to Colorado Springs in 1980. He
recently moved to Woodland Park.
   Smith had worked for about a year as a courier for the Pikes Peak
Library District. He died while driving a library district van on an
icy road. The van went out of control and was struck by another
vehicle, authorities said.
   ``He was a very, very capable and dear employee _ very well
liked,'' said Bernard Margolis, director of the library district.
``He was very appreciated by his colleagues. ...
   ``He liked people, he liked the library and he liked the world of
books.''
   Before joining the staff, Smith worked as a counselor at the
Brockhurst Ranch and the ARK, two alcoholic rehabilitation centers
in Green Mountain Falls. He was a state-certified drug and alcohol
counselor.
   Smith was a member of the Mystery Writers Guild of America.
   He married Harriet Hahn Smith on March 20, 1971, in Middletown,
N.Y. She is a columnist and deputy features editor of the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph.
   Smith is survived by his wife; his mother, Mary Lore Smith of
Bloomington; a sister and four daughters.
   Funeral services were incomplete.

FRANKIE AND JOHNNY (15) Cannon Trocadero
MISSISSIPPI MASALA (15) Curzon West End
LITTLE MAN TATE (PG) Odeon Haymarket
FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE (18) Odeon West End
DERSU UZALA (U) ICA
'Frankie And Johnny were lovers, Frankie and Johnny . . .' And there memory
fails me. What else were Frankie and Johnny? What else did they do in their
short but chart-topping lives?
According to Frankie And Johnny the film, their pop song fame created the
coup de foudre conditions whereby Al Pacino as a short-order cook called
Johnny met and fell in love with Michelle Pfeiffer as a plain (sic) waitress
called Frankie. The scene is a Brooklyn greasy spooner called the Apollo
Cafe. Here hamburgers and eggs-n-fries and patty melts keep whizzing past
director Garry Marshall's camera as if to show that two hearts in love had
better get a move on if their arteries are not to clog up first with
saturated fats.
Meanwhile down in the Deep South in Mississippi Masala, directed by Mira
Nair of Salaam Bombay, two more hearts try to interlock in the face of
difficulties. Mina (Sarita Choudhury), an Indian girl from Uganda, loves
Demetrius (Denzel Washington), a black carpet cleaner from Greenwood,
Mississippi. But tribal factionalism is rife in the South, even among
immigrant brethren. So a one-night passion in a motel brings the young
couple's dynastic worlds crashing around them. Aunts and uncles throw fits
and brothers and cousins throw fists.
Each of these love stories sets its alarm clock by the 'two hours' traffic'
(give or take five minutes) of Shakespeare's influential Romeo And Juliet.
But while this is a short time in which to watch passions flare and clans
clash in old Verona, it seems like forever when watching trumped-up screen
romances where Love's Tragic Obstacle, hereinafter referred to as LTO, seems
either non-existent (Frankie And Johnny) or politically contrived
(Mississippi Masala).
Hollywood - meaning Frankie And Johnny - specialises in invisible LTOs. As a
critic you have to hit yourself over the head with your press handout to
remind yourself that Michelle Pfeiffer is meant to be unattractive; hence
the hesitancy and 'last chance' element in her romance with Mr Pacino. For
the poor girl, we are told, has not had a serious date in three years. (In
Terrence McNally's original stage play Frankie was played more plausibly by
pudgy Kathy Bates of Misery).
So please ignore Pfeiffer's Gene Tierney bone structure and perfect lips and
concentrate on her hair. This has been made telegraphically dowdy. Except
when she curls it for a mid-movie night out and looks fit to slay le tout
Brooklyn. For this occasion her gay flatmate also picks out for her the One
Wearable Frock in her wardrobe, another slayer of course, hereinafter
referred to as the OWF. But love is blind. Peering through the New York
night or through the Apollo Cafe steam as he swings his big cucumber
chopper, Mr Pacino, acting with a charm far beyond the call of duty, sees
only an ugly duckling awaiting his transformative kiss.
Of course the OWF helps to overcome the LTO - except that we keep forgetting
what the LTO is, having been socked between the eyes by the form-fitting OWF
 -and Frankie and Johnny end up effecting the destined emotional merger.
The film, I may have indicated by now, is almost completely dotty. When not
focusing on Mr P and Miss P, director Marshall (late of Pretty Woman) whirs
around the cafe taking in such only-in-a-movie lovables as owner Hector 'I
breeng you all the way from Greece' Elizondo and his wife; easy-lay waitress
Kate Nelligan, plus heart of gold; and assorted wacky customers. And just
when you think sentimental folly can go no further, we have Mr Marshall's
one bid for stylistic virtuosity. This is a tender-talking street scene
between Pacino and Pfeiffer in which the couple's words sonically dissolve
into music while a florist's lorry behind them opens up to reveal a million
flowers. Oohh. Aahhh.
Mississippi Masala is, as one would expect from the British-produced item in
the week's romantic twin-pack, at once more serious and less fun. No
Hollywood schmaltz, no peak-condition screen goddesses playing plain Janes.
The LTO is racial bigotry and OWF stands not for One Wearable Frock but for
Only Way Forward. The OWF in the world today, as Sir Richard Attenborough
has so often told us, is for creeds and colours to unite. And here is Sir
R's very own Cry Freedom star Denzel Washington playing the nice black boy
who will rescue our Ugandan-Indian heroine from the
coloureds-versus-coloureds prejudice of his and her families.
A running joke is provided for American audiences, who need of course to be
told what an Indian is. So people keep saying 'Send them back to the
reservations' and Mr Washington keeps saying 'How many times I got to tell
you, they're not that sort of Indians.' And so the long day wears on.
Unlike Salaam Bombay, Mira Nair's new film is painfully alphabetical in its
guide to modern-day race attitudes and painfully contrived in the way it
routes its central romance through the appropriate stations of bigotry. In
Sooni Taraporevala's screenplay the message clearly took shape first, the
plot and the people second: always an error in priorities.
The week gets worse, I fear. Little Man Tate is the directing debut of
actress Jodie Foster. She also stars as the mother of an infant prodigy
(Adam Hann-Byrd) who could read at one, write poetry at four and play the
piano at competition level at six.
We meet him at seven, which should be about drinks time in a life as
hard-working as this. But despite Miss F's profession as a cocktail waitress
 -somewhere in Chinatown to judge by the Shanghai Lili dress she wears to
and from work - the boy is a goody two-shoes and so, alas, is the film. Like
a television problem-of-the-week movie, it slaloms between triumph and
tragedy, plinked out with piano music and with lines like 'Oh, what have I
done?'
This last is uttered by Dianne Wiest as the boy's unthinkingly cerebral
teacher-guardian. An ex-prodigy herself, she is America's answer to a
Hampstead intellectual. She feeds Fred macrobiotic drinks (he throws up),
pushes him into university ten years before his time (he is miserable) and
is then surprised that she has a crisis on her hands.
Happily - for Fred, that is, we the audience being too numbed to care - Miss
Foster rushes into the waiting emotional vacuum in the last scene and clasps
the boy to her bosom. The boy, still the only sensible presence in the film,
looks as intelligently frightened as he has throughout. Like us he seems to
be thinking: Why are two Oscar-winning actresses running around inside this
stalled vehicle trying to make it move by footwork alone? Scott Frank of
Dead Again wrote the script; the video is due out later this year; you may
wait.
Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is the latest and we are assured the last
visit from Old Pizza-Face. I have a dreadful feeling that I enjoyed this
film. For 90 minutes I was in the presence of a ghoulish janitor who, if he
ever met an infant prodigy, would know what to do with him.
This adventures climaxes with a 3D sequence in which various creatures come
out from the screen and dip their toes in your 7-Ups. You need to don the
cardboard glasses, which I perched precariously on my spectacles, but it is
only for ten minutes. Prior to this it is a walpurgisnacht for special
effects and the plot bravely tries to keep up.
I shall miss Freddy Krueger, played here with even more relish than usual,
not to mention more pizza toppings, by Robert Englund.
Finally, one from the arthouse. Kurosawa's 17-year-old Dersu Uzala, sombre
and resplendent, unfurls at the ICA. Made in Siberia, this tale of snowbound
friendship between a Russian explorer and a peasant has a rough majesty that
keeps out sentimentality and an epic humanism that never keeps out humour.
Do not wait for the video.

TERRENCE MAHON FINALLY STEPS OUT FROM BEHIND BIG SHADOWS AT OREGON; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: HERALDED LA HABRA RUNNER BOOSTS THE DUCKS BY GAINING 
ALL-AMERICAN HONORS AT THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Open the media guide of the University of Oregon's cross-country team, glance 
through the pages and witness the strong and storied tradition that unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Salazar . . . Rudy Chapa . . . Steve Prefontaine. The names loom from 
its record lists. Four national championships are among the highlights of its 
history; Bill Dellinger, its coach, is one of the nation's most well-respected. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, along with the guide's look at the past, there is a look at the 
present. Namely the members of the current Oregon squad, with brief biographies 
on each. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a glaring omission. His name is Terrence Mahon. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon, from La Habra High School, walked on at Oregon last year as a freshman. 
Because his chances of making the team were so poor, he decided to redshirt. 
Although he competed in several meets unattached, his performances were 
anything but extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
He was rarely noticed. Neither Dellinger nor the Oregon runners thought he 
would amount to much. So when it came time for the 1989 media guide to be 
printed last summer, Mahon wasn't included in the team biographies; he wasn't 
among those projected as a possible team member. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise, surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon, The Times' Orange County runner of the year in 1987, has in one year 
become a great boost for Oregon. Monday, at the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. cross-country championships at Annapolis, Md., Mahon placed 18th overall 
-- earning him All-American honors -- to help the Ducks to a second-place 
finish. Top-ranked Iowa was first. 
</P>
<P>
For Mahon, running for Oregon has been a dream come true. In high school, 
Mahon's team was good but certainly not great. Because of this, he often 
trained on his own and raced as an individual. All the way around, it's been a 
tremendous turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been the surprise of the year for us," Dellinger said. "If you were to 
ask me at the end of last year, I would have probably said there was no way he 
would make the team. I can't think of anyone who has surprised us at Oregon as 
much as Terrence has." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise No. 1 came at the team's training camp last summer. Mahon said the 
camp, at Odell Lake in central Oregon, gave him an opportunity to prove 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon kept up with the top team members through most of the workouts. On the 
final day, the team was to run a 10-miler. Mahon stuck with one of the team's 
better runners, Pat Haller, the entire distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat was someone who was predicted to do really well for us this year, so I 
wanted to show that after running hard all week, I was still strong enough to 
stay with him," Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to run well enough to show them that I should be taken to the 
first meet." 
</P>
<P>
At that first meet, Mahon finished as Oregon's No. 3 man. In the next race, he 
was Oregon's second finisher. At the Pac-10 championships at Stanford, he was 
Oregon's No. 3 man again, but he placed seventh overall, helping the Ducks win 
the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrence is definitely one of the reasons we're a better team this year," 
Dellinger said. 
</P>
<P>
At the NCAA Region 8 championships Nov. 11, Mahon placed fifth as Oregon swept 
the first five spots to win the meet with 15 points -- something no other 
Oregon team had done at the regional meet. In that race, Mahon surged in the 
final quarter mile past Stanford's Eric Mastalir, one of the nation's finest 
high school runners and a California state two-mile champion while at 
Carmichael Jesuit in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Mastalir, Mahon has outrun many of the top stars that he had met -- 
and could not beat -- in high school. They include: UCLA's David Scudamore, a 
two-time Southern Section cross-country champion from Palos Verdes; Arizona's 
Brian Grosso, the 1988 national cross-country champion, and UC Irvine's Aaron 
Mascorro, the 1987 state two-mile runner-up at Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Mascorro, who outkicked Mahon through two years of Southern Section competition 
-- "in every meet we were in together," Mahon said -- finished 21 spots behind 
Mahon at the Region 8 meet. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he thinks he's improved so dramatically, Mahon just shrugs. "I 
don't know," he said. "I put forth a lot of effort. It's just steady progress. 
. . . Oh, and I've lost 20 pounds (since high school)." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, being slim and trim is important for any distance runner -- Mahon is 
5-feet-9 and 128 pounds and said, "If I'm 127, I can't do a thing," -- but 
weight is not, in itself, a significant reason for success. 
</P>
<P>
Of certain significance, for Mahon anyway, is the fact that Oregon offers a 
runner-happy environment. Eugene, popularly known as Track City, U.S.A., is 
famous for its soft, scenic wood-chip running trails -- "Bark dust trails," 
Mahon said -- that are near inspirational for distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the local population includes many world-class athletes, such as longtime 
resident Mary Decker Slaney and Salazar. Salazar, trying to make a comeback 
after several years of injury and illness, regularly trains with the Oregon 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, rubbing elbows with running's elite doesn't mean the elite ability 
will rub off. But for Mahon, hard work has definitely made a difference. Since 
he arrived at Oregon last year, Mahon intensified his training program, 
increasing his mileage from about 50-60 miles a week as a high-schooler to 
around 100. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the higher mileage) helps me mentally," he said. "In a race, I wouldn't 
want a guy who puts in only 50 miles a week to pass me." 
</P>
<P>
And Mahon, a strength runner who sometimes suffered from a lack of speed, has 
improved in that area as well. In high school, Mahon never ran the two mile 
faster than 9 minutes 10 seconds, but Dellinger said last week Mahon ran a 9:03 
two mile in practice "as if he were jogging." 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that helped is I worked out with (Oregon's top two runners) 
Brad Hudson and Pete Fonseca this summer," Mahon said. "Brad trains like an 
animal. We do most of our running at six-minute (per mile) pace. Now, running 
6:30 pace feels too slow. I'm hammering myself, but not every day. I'm not 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger agreed: "He uses good common sense. That's hard for a young runner, 
sometimes. There's quite a jump between being a good runner in high school and 
a good runner in college. 
</P>
<P>
"What impresses me most about him is the consistency he shows. We have guys who 
work their fannies off to make the team, much like Terrence did. They're in 
great shape at first, but then later, they fall apart. He didn't do that. He 
made an immediate impression with the first race, then got better each week. 
He's for real. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to show you how important desire really is. A lot of people have 
talent but don't do anything with it. His is to a point where his desire has 
taken him to where he is today."

a touchdown on Wilcox's first play from scrimmage, and he made it 28-0 on a
50-yard run with 17 seconds remaining in the first half.;   His Friday night
output elevated his season totals to 1,638 yards in 150 carries and 22
touchdowns.;   Adams contributed first-half TD runs of 5 and 13 yards, and
finished with 113 yards in nine carries. He opened the third quarter with a
50-yard run to the 15, which led to a touchdown.;   "Shon and Terrence are
very impressive backs; they continue to get the job done," Wilcox Coach John
Sepulveda said. "You're certainly not going to find two backs of that caliber
in many high school backfields.";   No argument from Pioneer Coach Dan Lloyd.;
  "They had too much speed for us," Lloyd said. "Especially Lewis. Once he
broke beyond the line of scrimmage on his two touchdown runs, there was no
catching him.";   Wilcox quarterback Jermaine Mitchell joined in on the
scoring barrage in the third quarter, running 9 yards for one TD and throwing
a 32-yard pass to Nate Reyes for another.;   Pioneer (6-4), which finished
second in the Santa Teresa Athletic League, avoided a shutout when quarterback
Brian Yoshikawa scored on a 1-yard sneak with 34 seconds remaining.;  
Sepulveda also put in a good word for his forgotten unit -- the defense.;  
"It seems that Shon, Terrence and our offense receive most of the attention
from everyone, but our defense is pretty good, too," the coach said. "Todd
Banuelos, one of our inside linebackers, had an especially good game tonight.;
  "Todd has been doing the job since we lost David Yee to a knee injury a few
weeks ago, but David will be back in the middle with Todd for our next game.";

<HEAD>`The Lisbon Traviata' by Terrence McNally Revived Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrence McNally's ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' which
opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club, is more
than a play about obsession. It is two very different plays about
obsession.
   The first act is a blithe, bitchy look at one fan's extreme
fascination with opera; the second, a melodramatic and deadly
examination of a gay love affair gone wrong. The two don't tie
together neatly, but they make for some compelling, often
entertaining and even unnerving theater.
   McNally, author of ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
excels at the knowing put-down, the slightly sour but funny
observation. In the past, he has skewered New York theater people in
``It's Only a Play.''
   In ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' he dissects opera buffs, specifically
the homosexual fans who idolized certain female stars. These are the
men who call singers only by their first names, who have
encyclopedic knowledge of opera trivia and who buy every recording
made by their heroines.
   Mendy (Nathan Lane) is one such true believer, a worshipper of
Maria Callas. He learns his good friend Stephen (Anthony Heald) has
purchased a pirated recording of Callas' 1958 performance of ``La
Traviata'' in Lisbon.
   Much of Act 1 deals with Mendy's attempts to obtain a copy of the
record. In between the pleading and cajoling, the two men dish and
then demolish just about every diva around from Marilyn Horne to
Beverly Sills to Joan Sutherland. Their comments are mean, unfair
and funny.
   Yet there is a sadness, almost a desperation, underlying the
revelry.
   ``Opera doesn't reject me,'' Mendy sighs. ``The real world does.''
   Wearing a too-tight bathrobe, Lane flounces around an overdone
Manhattan apartment, designed by Philipp Jung to look like the
outside of a box of Valentine candy. Lane's is a joke-filled role
guaranteed to win audience sympathy, but the actor never succumbs to
buffonery or soap opera histrionics. He finds both the humor and the
humiliation in the character.
   Stephen is more enigmatic and not very likable, a trait that
doesn't really become apparent until the second act. By then, the
locale has switched to Stephen's apartment, a stark, sparse living
space filled with expensive stereo equipment and scores of neatly
shelved records and CDs.
   And the comedy has disappeared in favor of melodrama involving
Stephen, his lover Michael and Michael's new boyfriend. The plot
takes on aspects of grand opera as Stephen forces the play to a
tragic conclusion.
   The playwright has improved the play since its last incarnation
at a small off-off-Broadway theater four years ago. McNally has
enriched the second act, giving Michael a strong speech explaining
why he is leaving Stephen.
   Heald turns in a riveting performance as Stephen, whose fondness
for opera colors his real-life relationships. Dan Butler is fine as
the disgruntled lover. He forcefully articulates what is wrong when
someone only focuses on what he likes.
   From the comedy in Act 1 to the tragedy in Act 2, director John
Tillinger keeps a firm hand on the proceedings. The two acts may not
mesh, but they both point out that there are consequences when life
tries to imitate art.

<HL> Who's News:
Elkes Is Expected
To Leave His Post
As Chief of Viacom

   Terrence A. Elkes will leave his post as chief executive officer of Viacom International Inc., according to a source close to Viacom. 

   Viacom was recently acquired by National Amusements Inc., a Dedham, Mass.-based theater chain that took an 83% stake in the entertainment concern. 

   Mr. Elkes, attending a planning meeting in Nantucket, Mass., couldn't be reached, but a spokesman for him declined comment. 
Sumner Redstone, chairman of National Amusements, attending the same meeting, declined comment on Mr. Elkes's status at the company. 

   According to the Viacom source, Mr. Elkes's employment will be "terminated," allowing him to take advantage of so-called golden parachute provisions put in place before the company was acquired by National Amusements. 
Although the amount due to Mr. Elkes under the provisions couldn't immediately be determined, it is said to exceed $2 million. 
Mr. Elkes also held Viacom stock and options valued at $23 million at the time that National Amusements acquired the company. 

   Mr. Elkes and his management team attempted a leveraged buyout of Viacom, but in March lost a bitter bidding war to National Amusements, which is controlled by Mr. Redstone. 
A handful of other top executives involved in the buyout attempt are also expected to leave the company. 
Mr. Redstone also declined comment on other Viacom executives. 

   It isn't clear whether Mr. Redstone will name a successor to Mr. Elkes right away, but he indicated he is talking to outsiders for other senior positions at the company. 
One such position is the top job at Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc., a unit. 
Mr. Redstone said a number of entertainment industry executives have approached him about top positions at Viacom. 
Mr. Redstone is also said to have approached Time Inc. planning executive Winston Cox about the Showtime post. 
Another candidate is said to be Terrence A. McGuirk, currently president of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s cable network sales unit. 
Mr. McGuirk declined comment; Mr. Cox couldn't be reached for comment. 

   After National Amusements won the bidding war for Viacom, Mr. Redstone indicated that he was open to keeping Mr. Elkes and other management in place; Mr. Redstone has little expertise in Viacom's cable, broadcasting and program production operations. 
But relations between Mr. Elkes and Mr. Redstone remained strained. 
Moreover, Mr. Elkes is said to want to pursue other interests. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Redstone has said he is considering the sale of partial interests in a number of Viacom assets, including Showtime and cable programming networks MTV Networks and Nickelodeon. 
Mr. Redstone said yesterday that he was in discussion with a number of companies, but he declined to name them.

   Nathan Lane, who has finally won critical
acclaim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway hit, ``The Lisbon
Traviata,'' knows the pitfalls and pratfalls of an actor's struggle
upward.
   Lane thought his breakthrough into public recognition would come
with the play ``The Film Society,'' in which he played the lead, a
teacher in a private school in South Africa.
   But it had to wait for his present role, playing a hilariously
fanatic fan of diva Maria Callas, obsessed with hearing a pirated
recording of her singing ``La Traviata'' in Lisbon.
   Critics praised ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' now at the Promenade
Theater, and singled Lane out for their highest accolades.
   ``I've taken a big step in my career,'' Lane says. ``I feel
acceptance and respect. This sort of critical reception does have
an effect in the business.''
   Only 30 now, Lane began perfroming as a child.
   ``When I was in the sixth grade, we did a production of `Around
the World in 80 Days,' abbreviated, maybe 32 days,'' he says. ``I
played the servant to Phileas Fogg. They're being attacked by
Indians on a train. I went to hide. I was a chubby kid and I took a
little suitcase and crouched behind it. I was much larger than the
suitcase. It got a big laugh. ...
   ``It was like blood to a vampire. I thought, `This could be nice
to do.' I was bitten by the bug.''
   Lane was born in Jersey City, N.J., got a scholarship and
intended to go to college, but at the last minute took a job
touring the state in a musical about the history of New Jersey.
   He did dinner theater and summer stock.
   ``Eventually I moved to New York and starved,'' he says. ``I did
singing telegrams, sold TV Guide and cookbooks by phone, did
telephone polls. I called wheat farmers about what insecticide they
were using.''
   Lane did stand-up comedy with a partner. He was in ``One of the
Boys,'' a TV series that shot only 13 episodes, then got an
audition in 1982 for Noel Coward's ``Present Laughter'' directed by
and starring George C. Scott.
   ``It was the easiest audition I ever did,'' he says. ``Two days
later they called and said, `You got it.' I thought they'd get
somebody more established in the theater. It was my Broadway debut.
   ``No show since has gone as easily. George C. Scott was such a
gentleman, so great to me, like a father. If he'd asked me to jump
off the Brooklyn Bridge, I would have.''
   Asked whether scripts are pouring in now that ``The Lisbon
Traviata'' is a success, Lane says no, then amends it to, ``One
poured in today.''
   Director John Tillinger, who had directed Lane here in 1988 in
``The Film Society,'' suggested he be auditioned for the role of
Mendy in ``The Lisbon Traviata.''
   Lane, who considers himself a character actor not a comedian,
says: ``I love working with John. He's the first director in a long
time who thought of me in terms of more than just comedy.''
   Some people go to see ``The Lisbon Traviata'' without knowing
whether it's a comedy, tragedy, musical or drama, Lane says.
   ``It's a successful play,'' Lane says. ``If they aren't familiar
with the world they're going to enter, they're in for a big
surprise. The opera jokes are self-explanatory. Stephen says,
`Marilyn Horne sings like a truck driver.' I say, `Marilyn Horne IS
a truck driver. She was discovered driving a fork lift in a Los
Angeles gravel pit.'
   ``And after the initial realization that all the characters are
gay, the play becomes very universal.
   ``Slowly you realize it is about the fear of getting older and
of being alone and feeling so desperate about that you'd rather
kill your lover than let him leave you.
   ``I think it's a brave play, because it deliberately turns dark
in the second act,'' Lane says. ``By the end of the first act, you
see the darkness coming and the pain an sadness that is there, if
you're really paying attention. Some people feel cheated; they
thought it was just going to be laughs.
   ``People have walked out. It gets very frank. The moment of
nudity is not gratuitous. For Stephen to go home and see a nude,
young man there is meant to be shocking.''
   Older men and women whom one would expect to be put off by the
sexual frankness seem to respond to the play more than anyone, Lane
says. One older man told him: ``This was an old-fashioned drama
told in a whole new way. This is the most moving experience I've
had in the theater in 20 years.''

<HEAD>CFTC Charges 22 Traders in Alleged Bond Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two Chicago traders face large fines and
possible suspension for their alleged roles in a scheme to
pre-arrange trades for U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the traders
executed a series of transactions with Robert J. Griffin, a floor
broker on the Chicago Board of Trade, between July 10 and 24, 1986,
that ``were of the character of ... fictitious sales and that as a
result ... all of the traders caused prices to be reported that
were not true.''
   The six-count complaint disclosed Monday in Washington also
charged Griffin, who was trading on behalf of customers, with
fraud, alleging that his customers suffered losses because he
traded with the other 21 traders rather than file the orders
competitively.
   Griffin's attorney, Matt Lydon, denied the CFTC charges.
   ``The trades were executed at prices which were the best
attainable by the customers,'' Lydon said.
   The CFTC said a hearing before an administrative law judge would
be scheduled. The accused traders face possible penalties ranging
from fines of $100,000 per violation to revocation or suspension of
their licenses and trading privileges.
   The CFTC charges follow disclosures a few months ago that the
FBI was winding down a two-year undercover probe of alleged
wrongdoing among traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``I think the CFTC is pressing on this because of the FBI
investigation,'' one trader named in the complaint told the Chicago
Tribune. His name was not printed.
   ``They are trying to use this as a ploy to show Congress that it
(the CFTC) is a necessary agency,'' another trader named in the
complaint told the newspaper.
   Mark Prout, a spokesman for the Board of Trade, said after the
exchange became aware of the investigation in May 1988, it asked
the CFTC for permission to take over the probe, but received no
reply.
   Those named in the complaint were:
   John K. Angelo, Hinsdale, Ill.; Leonard Cahnmann and Roy E.
Erickson, Northbrook, Ill.; Terrence M. Corby, Brian D. Fox, George
D. Leventis, Yossi Morik, Peggy Anne Ogorek, Keith M. Rudman,
Thomas M. Schwarz, Pemberton H. Shober Jr. and George Tomlinson,
Chicago; Ronald J. Cohen, Arlington Heights, Ill.; Edmund J.
Conroy, Willowbrook, Ill.; Robert D. Furst Jr., Deephaven, Minn.;
Robert J. Griffin, Winnetka, Ill.; Terrence P. Madden, LaGrange,
Ill.; Bruce A. Nixon, Long Grove, Ill.; Anthony J. Roti, Glenview,
Ill.; Mary A. Rowell, Glencoe, Ill., and Dennis M. Sullivan,
Highland Park, Ill.

   When actress Bonnie Franklin first tried to land
the role of Frankie in ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
she couldn't even get an audition.
   Frankie, a wary, never-married waitress in a definitely
down-scale diner, wasn't anything like Ann Romano, the divorced,
working mother of two girls on TV's ``One Day at a Time,'' the role
Miss Franklin played for nine years.
   Casting directors, Miss Franklin says, ``think that's who you
are, rather than what you play. It's real frustrating because I
know what I can do.''
   Kathy Bates and Kenneth Welsh, the original Frankie and Johnny,
were replaced by Carol Kane and Bruce Weitz. When Kane and Weitz
decided to leave, Miss Franklin put in another, this time
successful, appeal to audition.
   Miss Franklin and Tony Musante, known from TV's ``Toma,'' went
into ``Frankie and Johnny'' on Sept. 13, after three weeks'
rehearsal. They're enjoying the collaboration so much they want to
work together again.
   ``We're so lucky,'' she says. ``There're only two of us out
there on stage. The trust has to be extraordinary. It could have
been we didn't trust each other and didn't get along.''
   The play is about the relationship between a waitress and a
short-order cook. He decides on their first date they should become
a couple. She, having been physically hurt and then dumped by a
longtime lover, wants a man in her life but is afraid to allow
herself to be vulnerable again.
   ``It's a wonderful play,'' Miss Franklin says. ``The more I do
it, the more I love it.''
   Audiences identify with Frankie, Miss Franklin says. ``She is
afraid to be left, damaged and hurt again in her life. I think
elements of that are in all of us.
   ``Johnny pushes so hard. Men don't want to see themselves as
steamrollers. But he's saying `Love me; let me into your life.' He
finally tells her, `I'm not good with people.'
   ``I think people get things from the play, wherever their own
pain is _ children, marriage, commitment or whatever. This is such
a love story. We've all had successes and failures in that part of
our lives. I think that's what affects so many people. And Terrence
McNally writes so beautifully, in a certain poetic rhythm.''
   She saw the play originally, Miss Franklin says, after her
husband of eight years, producer Marvin Minoff, saw it with his
daughter.
   ``I loved it,'' she says. ``I knew I would be wonderful in it
and I wanted to play it. I knew the director, Paul Benedict. We
both worked in Norman Lear's factory. He was in `The Jeffersons'
for nine years as the U.N. representative.
   ``I called him and said, `I saw your play and I want to replace
Kathy.' He said, `I'll put you on a list.' The producers didn't see
me. Maybe it was because of `One Day at a Time.' I wouldn't be
playing the mother of two kids.'' Miss Franklin recalls that after
her Broadway debut in the musical ``Applause'' she had trouble
being considered for anything other than musicals.
   She thought she'd have lots of time to see movies and friends
while acting in New York, Miss Franklin says, but finds that only
from noon till 4 p.m. can she ``have a life other than the work.''
   She starts preparing for the play about 4 p.m. ``I take a nap. I
get up and wash my hair. I think it is important for the show that
my hair not have a real stylish cut. I bought an ankle bracelet,
three rings and earrings and painted my toenails. That's all
Frankie.
   ``I take a good, strong half-hour walk to the theater. When I
get there, I light a candle, put on classical music and do vocal
exercises. There's a lot of talking in this play.''
   Asked about the future, Miss Franklin says, ``I know I'm going
back home to Los Angeles in January. I think it's important I have
a marriage. I wouldn't mind going back on TV. Tony and I are hoping
we'll get Terrence McNally to write us a series.''

<HEADLINE>  LOVE IN THE FAST LANE, LIFE IN THE LAND OF MOVIES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Freeman, who wrote this review for the Los Angeles Times, is the author of
"The Chinchilla Farm."  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Putnam, 320 pp., $19.95; BECAUSE so much of Karen Karbo's second novel deals
with the topic of marriage, which Voltaire once called "the only adventure
open to the cowardly," the title, "The Diamond Lane," has a nice double
meaning. The diamond lane, as every freeway commuter knows, is the one place
in the world where it's against the law to be single.;   Actually, this
astringent, humorous novel tackles two subjects ripe for satire -- the
Hollywood movie industry and marriage -- both notoriously fickle institutions
requiring blind hope to sustain life.;   In the film business, people spend 90
percent of their time hoping for the deal, the option, the big break, even a
lunch meeting. In marriage, about the same amount of energy is devoted to
hoping for intimacy, longevity and happiness. "It's psychological work, having
hope," as one character in this novel says.;   This is something Mouse and
Mimi FitzHenry, two sisters originally from the San Fernando Valley who are
now in their mid-30s, understand very well. They just hope for very different
things.;   Mouse, whose real name is Frances, is a no-nonsense documentary
film maker who has lived in Africa for many years. She's one of those women
for whom clothes and makeup are inconsequential. She and her English
boyfriend, Tony, are willing to go unwashed for weeks and live on handouts in
order to turn out unsalable documentaries on tribal marriage customs.;   
Mimi, on the other hand, is a creature of Hollywood, an aspiring actress and
screenwriter who toils away as a lowly secretary in a production office, a
woman obsessed with her appearance and weight, willing to accept the crumbs of
attention tossed her way by the obtuse and whining Ralph, her married lover,
another would-be screenwriter whose latest script is "Girls on Gaza.";   
Mouse and Mimi are reunited when Mouse is summoned home by a family medical
emergency. (Their mother, Shirl, is clobbered by a ceiling fan in a
restaurant). In Los Angeles, Mouse finds herself yielding to pressure from her
ailing mother to marry Tony, who has returned with her only to immediately
succumb to the make-a-megabuck syndrome.;    As if the prospect of Tony's
sellout and the upcoming marriage weren't disconcerting enough, Mouse
discovers a Los Angeles of new and unfathomable oddities has sprung up in her
absence: "The mysteries of life had multiplied like mold in a bag of cheap
hamburger buns during a heat wave.";   The marriage of Mouse and Tony turns
into a farce when Shirl, who has received a handsome insurance settlement from
the ceiling fan accident, turns over $100,000 in order to stage the wedding of
the century. Ivan, a seedy but talented documentary maker who is Mouse's
ex-boyfriend as well as Mimi's ex-husband, persuades Mouse to let him film the
preparations for the big event, much to Tony's displeasure.;   Part of what
Karbo is satirizing in this novel, in an often very wicked fashion, is the way
the ordinary rituals and activities in life -- love, work, marriage -- get
twisted into the most bizarre shapes when money and Hollywood values enter the
picture. Modern, urban, upwardly mobile American life -- especially as played
out in a myth-making center such as Los Angeles -- is really Karbo's subject.
She understands the banalities and excesses, the contradictions and
absurdities of living in a place where knowing not to put glitter in your
stucco is construed as good taste. (box)  </TEXT>

JULIE BROWN, QUEEN OF THE VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
AT LONG LAST, SHE GETS TO THE SCREEN IN 'EARTH GIRLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perched in the middle of a noisy Ventura Blvd. singles hang-out, working on her 
second bottle of mineral water, Julie Brown held her earrings out for 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
From her left ear, she produced a silver heart which dangled below a matching 
silver ball. From her right, a huge ruby globe attached to a gold hoop. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a matching set. "That's OK, I have four holes in my ears so I have lots 
of choices," Brown said, brushing back a tangled mane of henna-red hair. 
</P>
<P>
If invaders from Mars crash-landed in Studio City and demanded an audience with 
the Valley's Cinderella of Cool, you'd send them to Julie Brown's castle. Armed 
with a barbed wit and a fondness for the kookiest corners of pop culture, this 
tiny, red-headed dynamo is quickly making the leap from video cult heroine to 
showbiz personality. 
</P>
<P>
To use Brown's Valley Speak lingo -- she's a goddess in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Initially known for goofy novelty hits ("The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun"), 
she's graduated to MTV stardom, courtesy of "Just Say Julie," a weekly 
half-hour spoof which bashes every video pop tart from Tiffany to Tawny Kitaen 
-- and has quickly become one of MTV's highest-rated programs. 
</P>
<P>
After years of delays, Brown makes her film debut May 12 in "Earth Girls Are 
Easy," a colorful musical-comedy which, she also co-wrote. Despite the critical 
kudos the movie is now receiving, the film sat on a shelf for two years waiting 
for a distributor. In between movie-promotion junkets, Brown has also been 
shooting "Julie Brown: The Show," the pilot for a proposed CBS-TV comedy series 
which is described as a "Dinah Shore for the '90's gone awry." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's totally unique," said co-producer Ann Beatts, whose comedy 
credits include writing-producing stints on "Saturday Night Live" and "Square 
Pegs." "You always hear people described as multi-talented if they can simply 
read cue cards and open supermarkets. But Julie is smart, funny, loveable and 
has a great body. She can write, sing, dance -- I bet she can even roller-skate 
and paddle a canoe. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very reminiscent of Lucy and of Gilda Radner. They all have this very 
direct rapport with their audience -- they make you feel that it's incredibly 
important that you like them." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why the ebullient, busty comedienne is such a hit as MTV's 
resident sex-bomb satirist. As hostess of a show set in a kitchen with an ocean 
liner-shaped sink, a stuffed white poodle (with shades) and a couch made out of 
artificial grass, Brown celebrates Valley schlock in all its giddy, 
giraffe-print splendor. Like Pee-wee Herman and Buster Poindexter, she's 
created a real-life cartoon character who tightropes across the border between 
camp and cool. 
</P>
<P>
A parody of an over-amped, bitterly-competitive airhead, Brown's MTV alter-ego 
gets most of her laughs from heaping abuse on the channel's endless parade of 
video vixens. 
</P>
<P>
On a now legendary "PMS" episode, Brown throws herself tearfully in front of 
her TV set, snacking on dog food and dissing a Debbie Gibson video, growling 
"How does she get guys like that? She's only 16 -- what sexual tricks could she 
know?" Later, having mistakenly aired a Tiffany clip, Brown tears the video out 
of the machine, heaves it across the room and -- waving a rifle -- shoots it 
like a skeet target, screeching, "Kill it before it multiplies!" 
</P>
<P>
In person, Brown is considerably less frenetic, but still appealingly fiendish. 
Exhausted after a long day of rehearsals for her CBS show ("How do you like my 
stress cough?" she said, hacking away) she marshalled enough energy to take a 
visitor on a mini-tour of the Valley. The first stop: a neon-drenched Gap 
outlet on Ventura Boulevard. Brown quickly darted inside, cruising for V-neck 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
As she left the store, two bags under her arm, she pondered her other vices -- 
besides shopping. "Let's see," she said. "Iced coffee . . . Hair dye . . . Is 
that a vice?" She laughed. "Wait a minute. How about boys? It was so obvious I 
forgot about it for a second. You don't ruin your life over coffee, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Julie Brown's biggest break that almost ruined her life. After 
knocking around doing stand-up comedy and bit parts in sit-coms, Brown 
collaborated with writing partner Charlie Coffey and ex-husband Terrence 
McNally on "Earth Girls Are Easy," a musical fantasy about a trio of horny 
aliens whose spaceship lands in a Valley Girl's swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The trio sold the script in 1985, with Brown slated to play the leading role. A 
star was not born. 
</P>
<P>
"I really crashed and burned,' " she explained, heading east on Ventura Blvd. 
"It was the ultimate professional nightmare. The whole point of me writing it 
was that the part was for me. But then they told me I couldn't star in it. They 
could only get it made with a name actress. I wasn't big enough. They wanted a 
real star." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the producers landed Geena Davis. Brown settled for the second-lead 
of Candy, a ditzy Valley beautician. 
</P>
<P>
"After all that, the movie went into turnaround," she recalled. "Finally, it 
got picked up by (the DeLaurentiis Group) which made the movie -- and then they 
went out of business! So we had to screen it for everybody and finally Vestron 
got interested and they've been real enthusiastic about distributing it and 
then Geena won an Oscar, which is just a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Brown shrugged. "It's been 4 1/2 years since I first started doing this movie. 
I mean, I could've had children or gone to college already!" 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Girls" is such an affectionate satire of the Valley's loopy life style 
that it makes you wonder where Brown got such a keen eye for pop excess? 
</P>
<P>
"My family was very middle-class in the sense that everything looked perfect," 
she explained. "It was very Beaver Cleaver. But I don't think it was very real. 
It was like we were all on TV or something." 
</P>
<P>
At the movies one afternoon as a kid, Brown saw "Bye Bye Birdie." "It changed 
my life," she said. "I still want to go see Ann-Margret. That scene in 'Birdie' 
where she squeezes her breasts together . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Brown beamed. "I think it finally made me understand what it was like to be a 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
This new sensibility did not make Brown an ideal parochial school student. "I 
think I got my attitude that the world was totally bizarre by going to Catholic 
school," Brown said. "It was like Nazi prison camp. The nuns made you into 
robots. They'd scare you, even sneak up behind you and hit you. It was the most 
repressive environment." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Catholic school gave Brown a sense of theatre. "The Bible 
stories were all so theatrical, so melodramatic. It's the same way with the 
Valley. It's essentially suburbia, but it's so close to Hollywood -- with all 
the studios in Burbank -- that the the theatricality has seeped into suburbia 
and made it -- well -- suburbia, but bigger than life. So it has this great 
cheesy side to it." 
</P>
<P>
Always eager to find new material, Brown often drags her friends off in search 
of the lowest rungs of pop culture, whether it's a pit-bull contest in 
Riverside, a swap meet in Pasadena or a Dean Martin lounge show in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to put a lot of stuff into my head," she said. "My writing partner and 
I went to a Connie Francis concert and it was so amazing -- we got the whole 
concept and feel for our next movie. We were laughing so much we had to cover 
our mouths. We kept furiously scribbling all the plot points on our Connie 
Francis programs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Girls' " bumpy progress taught Brown a valuable lesson. "You have to 
separate yourself from your work and learn to value yourself as a person," she 
said over dinner. "I think show business is a great job, but it's not your 
life. You just can't let all the show business stuff take over your life. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to value my friends and my personal life, because it's important to 
have people you can depend on, that you can be vulnerable with and just be 
normal with." 
</P>
<P>
Her friends value Brown's loyalty in return. "What makes Julie special is that 
she didn't wait around for someone to write her movies or shows -- she did it 
herself," says songwriter pal Allee Willis, who designs the sets for "Just Say 
Julie." "And let me tell you, she definitely looks out for her friends. We do 
similar work, but she's never competitive. In fact, she's tossed a lot of work 
my way." 
</P>
<P>
Brown took her personal-improvement regime one step further. "I kicked all the 
psychos out of my life," she said firmly. "I had a crazy relationship, which I 
got out of. I stopped working with some crazy producers. I cut myself off from 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
She sighed. "The thing about psychos, especially Hollywood psychos, is that 
they can be very fascinating and totally compelling. They are never boring. But 
it gets a little scary when you try to have a real life with them." 
</P>
<P>
Brown rolled her eyes. "I mean, I loved the Sex Pistols, but would you want to 
be in a relationship with Sid Vicious?" 
</P>
<P>
She laughed. "Hey, Madonna. Some free advice. Find a nice accountant!" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Promoting one of her pop parodies on MTV, Brown sat in for Julie Brown, MTV's 
black veejay of the same name, who was off quietly having a nose job -- at 
least until her namesake announced it on the air. "I came on and said, 'Hi, I'm 
Julie Brown after plastic surgery,' " recalled the comedienne, who is now known 
in MTV circles as Julie (West Coast) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed by her tart sense of humor, MTV eagerly gave Brown her own show. With 
a kitschy atomic-age set designed by Willis, "Just Say Julie" has become a camp 
classic. Shot on a low-low budget ("the whole thing costs about $1.50" says 
Willis), "Julie" is videoland's first self-referential satire. Asked to show 
current clips during each show, Brown mercilessly lampoons MTV's non-stop array 
of videos adorned with scantily-clad models and dancers. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent show, titled "How To a Model Day," Brown aired a popular Whitesnake 
video which features the band's shaggy-maned lead singer, David Coverdale, and 
sexy footage of model (and Coverdale girlfriend) Tawny Kitaen. Pretending to be 
Kitaen, Brown narrated the clip in a breathless whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Kitaen popped up in the clip, Brown would squeal "That's me!" When 
Kitaen and Coverdale performed a steamy love scene, she cooed: "Look, I'm 
sticking my tongue in his ear. That's always important to do in a video, 
because then they ask you back to do more videos!" 
</P>
<P>
Brown loves to joke that she was a Homecoming Princess in high school because 
she got both "the cheerleader and the low-rider vote." She's clearly a Valley 
insider -- only a gal who drove her Volkswagon through the hallways of her high 
school science building ("Hey, I got laughs!") could offer such a dead-on 
imitation of this vacuous Valley chatter. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Julie Brown, a lowly earth girl who's become the princess of 
Planet MTV, really want? "I'd love to just have a regular job," she said, 
almost wistfully. "It would be great if this CBS show happened, so I could go 
to work everyday, see the same people and come home at night and have dinner 
and watch TV. 
</P>
<P>
"My life has been so chaotic, that a normal job looks pretty good to me. I know 
it sounds so predictable, but predictability can be very reassuring." 
</P>
<P>
She shrugged. "And hey -- having your own TV show is a pretty fun job. Who's 
going to argue with that?"

<HEAD>Shanna Reed of `Major Dad' Toughs It Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Shanna Reed spent a summer week roughing it
in the backwoods of Maine _ a tough-it-out struggle which might
serve her well in her new job with the Marines in CBS' ``Major
Dad.''
   In the coming fall season, Maj. J.D. ``Mac'' McGillis (played by
Gerald McRaney) is transferred to a small Marine base in Virginia.
Reed plays his wife Polly, who braves the hazards of a job on the
post newspaper.
   The show began last year with Major McGillis as a gung-ho
Marine, a bachelor in his early 40s, who has a whirlwind courtship
with a widow with three daughters and suddenly finds himself in a
house full of females.
   In the break between seasons of ``Major Dad,'' Reed went on a
strenuous canoeing trip on the Androscoggin River and Umbagog Lake
in Maine.
   The canoe trip had some aspects of a military adventure.
   ``There were 12 of us, including two guides, in six canoes,''
she said. ``Every day we had different duties, like navigator one
day, cook the next. The guides didn't interfere. We took a wrong
turn one day and had to paddle back. ``We forgot our tents, so we
roughed it. I covered myself head to foot and wrapped myself in
mosquito netting and still got bit. The thing I got the most out of
was the teamwork. Everyone needed someone else.''
   In the second season of ``Major Dad,'' the show moves to
Virginia and enlists three new characters. The camp is on the
bubble _ military cutbacks threaten it with closing.
   A lot of the comic conflict, however, will come from Polly's new
job as a reporter on the camp newspaper.
   ``Mac's in charge of the newspaper, so her articles will be
edited by Mac and the general,'' she said. ``She'll have to do some
rewriting. I'll be the editor of the feature section, called `At
Ease.' We'll live on base, so the kids will also be involved in the
military system.''
   ``Major Dad'' is the fourth series for Reed. She was in ``For
Love and Honor'' (another military series), ``I Had Three Wives''
and ``The Colbys.'' She was also a semi-regular on ``HeartBeat''
and starred in the soap opera ``Texas.''
   ``Polly's feisty, and I know that's an overused description, and
intelligent and independent,'' Reed said. ``She'll jump in over her
head and find herself overwhelmed. I want to see more of that,
where you have someone who's not completely comfortable in her
environment. She has a lot of good qualities. I don't have kids,
but I hope to be the kind of parent she is. She values
communication and honesty with her kids.
   ``She's a romantic at heart. An overboard romantic, which I'd
like to see more of. We have to keep romance a prominent part of
the show. I think Mac and I have good chemistry. You have to get to
the husband and wife and get beyond their work.''
   Reed was born in Kansas City, but grew up in Phoenix. She began
dancing at 16, and after a year of college went to Las Vegas and
joined the Folies Bergere at the Tropicana.
   ``I was very green, but I had a lot of energy. I never thought
about acting until I spent a year and a half in the road company of
`A Chorus Line.' I moved to New York and got into the stage play
`Dancin',' and I started taking acting lessons.''
   Reed is married to Terrence O'Hara, a movie director and former
actor she met in acting class.
   In addition to Reed's camping adventure, she went to Europe this
summer to appear in the latest remake of ``Three Coins in the
Fountain,'' the story of three women seeking romance and fun in
Rome.
   This version, co-starring Loni Anderson, Stepfanie Kramer and
Anthony Newly, will be broadcast on CBS. The original, which won an
Oscar for its theme song, was made in 1954. A remake was released
10 years later, but the location was moved to Spain.
   The latest edition returns to Rome, but only a bit was filmed in
the Eternal City.
   ``We filmed most of it in Luxembourg, using it for Rome,'' Reed
said. ``Apparently it was cheaper and they had a warehouse we used
for a sound stage. They were shooting a `Dracula' movie at the same
time we were there.''

<TEXT>
   New Musicals, an ambitious laboratory for the
development of new American musical theater, has folded after only
one production, it was announced Monday.
   The production company was terminated July 25, one month after
its first show, ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' closed out a
disappointing run at the State University of New York at Purchase.
   ``I overestimated the box-office income and undercapitalized the
operation,'' said Martin J. Bell, producing director of New
Musicals. ``The size of our audience could only support workshops
or small musicals, which was contrary to our mission.''
   ``Spider Woman'' was a lavish musical version of the Manuel Puig
novel. It had a book by Terrence McNally, a score by John Kander
and Fred Ebb and was directed by Harold Prince. The musical, which
starred John Rubinstein and Kevin Gray, played an eight-week
engagement in Purchase, from May 1 through June 24.
   New Musicals had a $10 million budget for its first year which
was to have included three more musicals. Investors, including
Capital Cities-ABC, Inc., Columbia Artists Management, Inc., and
Jujamcyn Theaters, had put up a total of about $2.5 million to get
the project going.
   Other moneys were expected from the box-office receipts of
``Spider Woman,'' which drew less than 40 percent capacity at a
1,375-seat theater in the university's performing arts complex.
   Bell said the box-office receipts were hurt by the mostly
negative reviews, especially in The New York Times. The producer
had asked that critics not review the show because it was a work in
progress and that a review ``defeats what we're trying to do
here.'' Besides the Times, the musical was reviewed by the Daily
News, the New York Post, The Associated Press and several other
publications.
   ``My heart is broken, but working on `Kiss of the Spider Woman'
with Hal Prince, John Kander, Fred Ebb, Terrence McNally and the
rest of the gang was worth it all,'' Bell said. ``There were times
sitting in that theater during the process when I knew this was the
only place on Earth I wanted to be.''

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Film:
   Jodie Foster on the Other Side of the Camera
   ----
   By Julie Salamon
</HL>
<DATE>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20
</SO>
<LP>
   Time magazine took the occasion of "Little Man Tate,"
Jodie Foster's directing debut, to put the actress on its
cover. This puts rather too heavy a burden on this nice
little film. Ms. Foster herself was far more unpretentious in
her undertaking than the hoopla surrounding it would imply.
If anything, this promising start to her second career is too
restrained.
   "Little Man Tate" is the story of a child genius trying to
find his place. He's never known his father. His mother,
Dede, a spirited woman working as a cocktail waitress, hasn't
quite found her place either. Word of his brainpower has made
the rounds in his hometown of Cincinnati, and he is being
sought by the founder of an institute for gifted children.
The founder, a former gifted child, wants to rescue him (and
all young geniuses) from the ordinary world so they won't
suffer feelings of alienation as she did.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Telling the story from Fred Tate's -- the little man's --
point of view, Ms. Foster has tried to adopt the droll,
knowing tone that the great French film makers used so
successfully in movies about adolescence. She's succeeded in
many ways, and failed in others. The camerawork (by Mike
Southon) is artful yet unselfconscious, and Mark Isham's
score adds a jazzy elegance. Scott Frank's screenplay
contains within it a good story. So the film is pleasant to
watch and to listen to.
   But Ms. Foster has carried understatement to an extreme.
Fred Tate, who narrates, tells his story as a series of
events, not all of them directly related. There should be
some emotional connection, however, and it's never made
obvious. Subtlety is fine, but Ms. Foster has approached the
material a little too hesitantly, too earnestly, without the
touch of naughtiness it needs to touch off a spark.
   Part of the problem comes in her leading man, Adam
Hann-Byrd, a nine-year-old non-actor. He has a great face --
dreamy but not pretty -- but he's too much a cipher.
Everything is filtered through him, and he doesn't react.
   That feeling of distance permeates the film. The adult
actors, experienced and talented, are vague as well. Ms.
Foster the director decided not to let Ms. Foster the actress
(she plays Fred's mother) dominate the screen. Since the film
is presented from Fred's viewpoint, you'd expect to see her
as he does, as a major figure. But the audience isn't really
clued into what seems to be Fred's romanticized, protective
vision of his mother. She's either smiling bravely or
erupting in mild bursts of anger or looking worried, and
these activities don't begin to explore the breadth of Ms.
Foster's acting range.
   Dianne Wiest plays Jane Grierson, the uptight gatherer of
gifted children. She and Fred's mother are competing for the
two poles of Fred's soul: his brain and his heart. Bored by
regular school, and lonely, he's read all of Jane's books and
is eager to join her, though he doesn't want to hurt his
mother.
   Though Ms. Wiest has been placed in sterile environments,
she doesn't seem the opposite of warm and nurturing, with her
honeyed voice and crinkly eyes. Neither the script nor the
direction give her much room to overcome her appearance of
niceness and warmth. So the tension that is supposed to exist
in the struggle between Jane and Dede, Fred's mother, doesn't
present itself, in any form.
   The movie comes most to life when Jane takes Fred and some
other little geniuses on a three-week "Odyssey of the Mind,"
sort of a traveling quiz show. On the trip Fred meets Matt
Montini, "the Mathemagician," played with wise-cracking
finess by Michael Shulman. The cynical awareness of this
aging child genius is welcome after all the restraint
exercised by everyone else, including the director.
   ---
   Terrence McNally's popular play, "Frankie and Johnny in
the Clair de Lune," was a funny, sentimental piece about the
romance between a short-order cook and a waitress who meet in
the New York diner where they work. Kathy Bates, the actress
best known to movie audiences as the crazed fan in "Misery"
and not as a glamour girl in the traditional sense, played
Frankie, the waitress.
   Frankie is well into her 30s, has sworn off men and eats
too much (and shows it). Director Garry Marshall decided the
perfect person to play her on film was the svelte beauty
Michelle Pfeiffer, a decision that reportedly made Ms. Bates
"laugh and laugh."
   In "Frankie and Johnny" -- the title as well as the
leading lady was trimmed for Hollywood -- Ms. Pfeiffer is
actually quite wonderful as the tough, neurotic waitress. She
has great comic timing and is quite touching in the sad parts
-- though the only time her persistent snacking is at all
credible comes when she starts spooning peanut butter into
her mouth and chokes. You can believe she can't get food to
go down that beautiful slender throat.
   Al Pacino is her Johnny, and he is romantic and poignant
opposite Ms. Pfeiffer, and keeps it up, long after the movie
has established its premise and repeated it many times. Mr.
McNally, the playwright, wrote the screenplay, heavily soaked
in schmaltz and audience-pleasing one-liners. The repartee
among the diner employees (notably Kate Nelligan's sassy
waitress) is especially amusing. Mr. Marshall, the director
whose credits include "Pretty Woman" and "Nothing in Common,"
knows exactly what to do with this kind of sentimental
comedy, and he does it to the hilt.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: "Frankie and Johnny" didn't give Mr. Pacino his
first chance to stare at Ms. Pfeiffer with those big doggy
eyes. That happened in Brian De Palma's "Scarface," in which
Ms. Pfeiffer played the ice queen wife to Mr. Pacino's heated
Cuban mobster.

<TEXT>     Houston screen-tested for the part with Costner -- and scored well. At the
producer's request she is not taking any acting lessons in preparation of the
film's November start. "We want her to come off naturally, with a virgin
quality," says Wilson.;   Plans call for Houston to sing two or three songs in
the Warner Bros. production, although, stresses Wilson, "This will in no way
become the Whitney Houston show.";   He adds that the property has been
knocking around for years -- many years. In fact, it was originally planned as
a vehicle for Diana Ross and Steve McQueen, who died in 1980.;  
Interestingly, Lawrence Kasdan did not write it as an interracial love story
-- and it isn't one now. The matter of color will never be touched upon in
"The Bodyguard.";   BIG-SCREEN SCENE: Producer Dan Melnick is in discussions
with directors for "Renegades," and when -- and only when -- one has been
hired will he deal with the subject of a leading man. "Renegades" is the film
in which Julia Roberts and former fiance Keifer Sutherland were to star.
Sutherland counted himself out after his split with Roberts and, says Melnick,
the field's wide open -- in spite of rumors that Roberts' current beau, Jason
Patric, will fill the bill. Those rumors, insists Melnick, were made out of
whole cloth.;   TOUGH DUTY: Judith Krantz's "Secrets" soap opera is gearing up
for its European production shoot. Sixty-five episodes of the new daytime soap
will be shot in Monte Carlo and Milan by next April. Meanwhile, Krantz and
husband Steve are busy here at home. She's completing her next potential best

adaptation of her "Dazzle" novel.;   CHRISTMAS IN JULY: The CBS-TV movie
"Christmas on Division Street," scheduled for Dec. 15 airing, is set in
Philadelphia in the winter, but was shot in Vancouver in the summer, reports
writer-producer Barry Morrow. He explains, "It was the only time I could get
Fred Savage and Hume Cronyn, who co-star, together." Morrow fought against the
summer shoot. "We needed snow for the story and I didn't think we could do it
realistically with artificial means. I was wrong. We used potato flakes,
blankets of white crepe, an ice machine -- and hauled snow down from an
iceberg. As a Minnesota native, I know what cold looks like -- and this
picture looks cold."; From Liz Smith in New York;   TALK OF THE TOWN: People
are talking about the hot new book by Eileen Franklin-Lipsker and William
Wright, "Sins of the Father," subtitled "The Landmark Franklin Case: A
Daughter, a Memory and a Murder" and being published by Crown later this
month.;   In a murder trial in Redwood City last January Franklin-Lipsker
testified that after 20 years, she suddenly remembered that her father had
killed her childhood playmate in Foster City. Her father, George T. Franklin
Sr., was convicted of first-degree murder in November and sentenced to life in
prison. He has appealed.;   Now Lesley Stahl of "60 Minutes" has gotten the
jump on this story -- she will interview Franklin-Lipsker tonight on CBS.;  
BENEFIT TIME: There is another terrific benefit on Thursday for the Manhattan

   At 41, veteran hard rocker Iggy Pop is on
the comeback trail with what he feels is a clearer head and more
control of his music.
   Pop left the music scene in 1982, disillusioned after a 14-year
career. He resurfaced briefly with the 1986 album, ``Blah Blah
Blah.''
   ``I realized the way I was approaching my life and work had
become untenable,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``I couldn't go on saying, `Let's get a couple of grams of blow
and write a song. Let's get stoned before the gig. Let's get stoned
after the gig. I'm in town, where are the girls?''' he said. ``I
was living the classic wild style, and that was no longer working
for me.''
   Pop said that lifestyle ``crept up on me slowly for years, and
it was a lot of work to change my way of thinking. I'm not AA or
anything. My ethic is that I work hard, do what I do under my own
power, and at the end of the day, like everybody else in the world,
I do what I can get away with.''
   Pop, who performs Sunday at the University of California,
Irvine, has just released the album ``Instinct.'' Admitting it may
be ``too steaming, too overdrive,'' he nonetheless says he's proud
that ``it's me, it's honest.''

   Charlie Daniels says he has quit
performing one of his biggest hits, ``Long Haired Country Boy,''
for fear that it glamorizes drug and alcohol abuse.
   The 1974 song talks about ``getting stoned every morning and
drunk every afternoon.''
   Daniels said in an interview Thursday the song was written in
fun but he did not want to make it appear that the record was
glorifying drinking and drug use.
   ``Times change, and I decided to take it out of the show. It was
the Christian thing to do,'' said the leader of the Charlie Daniels
Band. The five-piece country-rock group is also known for ``The
Devil Went Down to Georgia,'' ``Uneasy Rider'' and ``The South's
Gonna Do It Again.''

   U2 vocalist Bono, who says past live footage of
his band seemed ``like pornography to me,'' is hopeful the
Grammy-winning Irish group's upcoming concert film captures its
commitment to rock 'n' roll.
   ``There's a lot at stake for us. It's something almost sacred,''
the singer said about ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' in the November issue
of Premiere magazine.
   ``It's what we do best,'' he said. ``We've never really been
able to make records. We're a live band, and that's more important
to me than the records.''
   Bono said ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' will show a side of him unknown
to those who've never seen the band live. ``Being on a stage is a
special place, a place apart. It's where I reach down into myself
and bring up stuff. ... There are times onstage where I completely
lose myself.''
   U2 will release a double-album soundtrack to the film, which is
directed by Phil Joanou.

   Prince Andrew said in a rare interview Thursday
that the long separations that his job as a junior officer demands
have been hard on his marriage.
   ``Before getting married I never bothered about going away
because it was fun. But I think to be split from one's wife for so
long cannot be good for the long-term relationship,'' Andrew told
Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   Andrew, the Duke of York and a lieutenant aboard the HMS
Edinburgh, was separated from his wife, Sarah, from June until
mid-August when their first child was born, and for another month
until they met in Australia, where they are on an official visit.
The interview was conducted in Sydney.
   ``I don't like it, full stop,'' he said of the separations, but
added: ``You just have to take it, otherwise the navy could not
exist.''
   Andrew, 28, married Sarah Ferguson in July 1986. They have a
2-month-old daughter, Beatrice. Andrew has been in the navy for
nine years.

   A mistrial has been declared in a $2.75 million
suit filed against pop icon Prince by a TV cameraman who claims one
of the singer's bodyguards roughed him up.
   In declaring the mistrial Wednesday, Common Pleas Judge Frank J.
Gorman admonished The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer for revealing that
the camerman, James R. Gates, had rejected a $100,000 out-of-court
settlement over the 1984 incident. Gorman said the story would
prejudice the trial.
   When Prince's lawyer Terrence J. Kenneally asked Gorman to
declare the mistrial, Gates' lawyer, Jeffrey M. Embleton, said he
would not object.
   Prince offered testimony via videotape Tuesday. He is currently
on tour to promote his ``Lovesexy'' album.

   It was a goofy, daffy idea, a Mickey Mouse
notion if ever there was one, to combine cartoon characters with
human actors in a big budget film.
   The Walt Disney Co. is taking a gamble that might have given
pause to even its risk-taking founder. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''
reaches the nation's screens Wednesday after three years of
planning and production and an estimated $40 million in costs.
   It's a project that combines a 1940s private-eye caper with just
about every cartoon character in film history.
   The movie stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna
Cassidy, plus Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Dumbo, Daffy Duck, Betty
Boop, Donald Duck and two cartoon newcomers, the comic Roger Rabbit
and his sexpot wife, Jessica.
   In the film, a down-at-the-heels detective (Hoskins) is hired by
a cartoon studio boss to uncover why his star, Roger Rabbit, is
unable to perform. Hoskins discovers the star's voluptuous wife is
being blackmailed as part of an elaborate scheme to take over the
cartoon studio to make way for real estate development and a
freeway.
   The project originated from a book by Gary K. Wolf, ``Who
Censored Roger Rabbit,'' which an earlier Disney regime bought for
a feature film. A rising young director, Robert Zemeckis, read the
script in 1982 and was interested in making the film. But the
Disney company, beleaguered by flops and takeover threats, was
unable to mount the production.
   Four years later, Zemeckis had already directed the hits
``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Back to the Future,'' and Disney had
been revitalized by new management. The company enlisted Steven
Spielberg as a partner, and he showed the script to Zemeckis in the
winter of 1985.
   ``The first thing we had to do was decide whether in fact we
could make the movie,'' said Zemeckis, who resembles an overgrown
kid at 37. ``It had never been done before.
   ``So we asked Disney for permission to do a test, a 30-second
obstacle course for Roger. Richard (Williams) animated it, and ILM
(Industrial Light and Magic) did the optical work. When it was
finished, we were all astounded, and there was no doubt that we
were going forward.
   ``One of the prerequisites that I laid down to do the movie was
that it really needed all the cartoon characters from the other
studios.''
   Spielberg was the spark plug in acquiring the clearances.
   Zemeckis bypassed the Disney animation department and hired
Williams, a Canadian, as animator. Williams had made a number of
imaginative films, including the 1971 Academy Award-winning ``A
Christmas Carol,'' and done the ``Pink Panther'' animation.
   ``Bob told me he wanted the Disney articulation, Warners
characters and (Tex) Avery humor _ but not so brutal,'' Williams
said. Avery was the gifted animator of Bugs Bunny and other far-out
characters.
   ``In other words, we should aim for believability but it could
be zany.'' Williams and his staff faced the challenge of developing
the title character. After all, rabbits had already been cartoon
stars, from Walt Disney's Oswald of the 1920s to Bugs Bunny.
   ``There's an awful lot of Oswald in Roger,'' said Williams. ``He
has the little overalls, and he's a white rabbit. Oswald was
shorter, so we had to stretch him out. With the red overalls, white
rabbit and blue bow tie, he became like an American flag.''
   Originally, scenes including both humans and animated characters
were to occupy 40 minutes of the film. The final amount was 58 out
of the 103-minute running time.
   ``We knew we had to have great actors; that was the key to it,''
Zemeckis said. ``That's why it was important to cast someone like
Bob Hoskins, who is first and foremost a great actor. He had not
only to do his performance but simultaneously imagine the cartoon
performance, plus all the technical things: eye-lines, marks and
the pantomime that he had to do.''
   Hoskins was aided by Charles Fleischer, a stand-up comic who
played Roger Rabbit's voice.
   ``Charlie stood off-camera and gave me Roger's lines,'' said the
British actor. ``That was a big help. So was playing with those
little dolls they dreamed up.''
   Zemeckis provided the actors with character-size dolls to act
with, and had extensive storyboards to illustrate how the scenes
would look. At the end of each completed scene, another ``reference
take'' was filmed as an aid to animators who would draw in the
characters.
   The exterior live action of ``Roger Rabbit'' was filmed in Los
Angeles beginning in December 1986. Interior sets were built at
London's Elstree studio, many of them 10 feet off the stage floor
to accommodate puppeteers working with robot arms and wires.
Zemeckis edited the film scene by scene and handed the material
over to Williams and his animators.
   Previewers have marveled at how masterfully the live actors
combine with the cartoon figures.
   ``We did it by violating the rules,'' Williams explained.
``Fortunately I never knew the rules. ...
   ``The old way of doing it was to lock the camera and light the
live actors flat because the animation would be flat. Why? Just
before `Roger Rabbit,' I did a couple of Fanta soft drink
commercials for overseas, using Disney characters. I shot the live
action myself, running the camera through a bunch of kids playing
football. Then I animated Mickey and Donald running with the ball
through the kids' legs. It wasn't supposed to work, but it did.
Totally.
   ``It was a little more work to make the animated characters
compensate for the perspective. I told Bob just to shoot his scenes
with wide-angle cameras, and we'd just draw in the characters to
fit the space. We tried it and it worked 100 percent.''
   Having devoted three years of his life to ``Roger Rabbit,''
Zemeckis plans to vacation this summer. He plans to take his wife
and son to Hawaii and spend the rest of the time at home.
   His next movie?
   ``A nice film with live actors and no special effects,'' he said.

   Jean Holloway Tobin, a radio, film
and TV scriptwriter whose credits included ``Wagon Train,'' ``Dr.
Kildare'' and ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' has died of a stroke. She was
72.
   Mrs. Tobin, who died Saturday, began writing for radio with
``The Kate Smith Show'' in the late 1930s.
   While still in her 20s, she wrote for such prestigious shows as
``The Hallmark Radio Hall of Fame,'' where she condensed major
contemporary novels into 30 minutes of air time; ``Mr. President,''
where each week Edward Arnold portrayed a different president, and
``Mayor of the Town,'' a melodrama with Lionel Barrymore.
   From 1946 to 1948 she wrote the film musicals ``Till the Clouds
Roll By,'' ``Words and Music'' and ``Summer Holiday,'' an
adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ``Ah Wilderness!''
   After moving to television, where she wrote scripts for such
shows as ``How the West Was Won,'' she met her husband, Dan Tobin,
who played Terrence Clay on ``Perry Mason.'' He died in 1982.
   Her TV writing career extended into the 1970s with the pilot for
``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' and other shows.
   She had no immediate survivors.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.
