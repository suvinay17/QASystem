Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were
stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather
reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts,
somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news.
</P>
<P>
A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around
the world.
</P>
<P>
When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10
years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the
announcement came from a man whose WTB' "superstation" in Atlanta used to
fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who
once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle.
Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three
networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here
anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal."
</P>
<P>
CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National
Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was
located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played
"You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out.
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan administration and the three
networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's
paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50
million. Its broadcasts would reach-indeed span-the globe to about 90
countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would
become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match.
</P>
<P>
The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, president, CNN
</P>
<P>
"I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when TBS first went up on
satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since they had the new
movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on TBS, I thought the
next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news channel. That's
where I got the idea. . . Even though I did not have the money and did not know
anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept was good
enough to go ahead and give it a shot.
</P>
<P>
"The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say
that I minded in retrospect."
</P>
<P>
Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new contract I was being offered at ABC
as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was tired of the network pool I had
been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone Arledge spent an hour in his
office warning me it would be very bad for my career to go do something called
CNN. When I left, most people weren't even trying to conceal their derision,
their snickers. My attitude when I walked into CNN was the same attitude I had
at Marine Corps boot camp the first day. "I'm here. Let's get on with it."
</P>
<P>
"The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's
speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we
were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, "They're
shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio, and you could hear agents
running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't
get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our
coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something.
I wasn't making as much money as Dan, Peter or Tom-I still don't-but I knew I
was in the right place."
</P>
<P>
Ed Turner, executive vice president of news gathering
</P>
<P>
"We started out in half terror and half confidence. We all ran scared. Hell, we
still do. The conventional wisdom was that CNN was not going to make it. They
told us, 'First, there's no way you guys are going to get on the air. Second,
if you get on the air, there's no way you're going to stay there. Third, if by
some remote chance you do stay on the air, you'll bankrupt Ted (Turner).' Other
than that, it was a lot of encouragement."
</P>
<P>
Lou Dobbs, vice president of business news
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect competitively. My principal concern was not that
we couldn't pull it off. But I wanted to know would CBS emulate? Would ABC
duplicate? That was my fear. I knew that after we were on the air for six
months, we would be very vulnerable to the networks. Starting a 24-hour news
network required an investment by Ted Turner that could have bankrupted him,
but to the networks that kind of money is pocket change. The fact that a
successful imitator hasn't arisen astounds me to this day. The networks'
failure to react to the competitive threat of CNN was the answer to my
prayers."
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked into the Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at
a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland MGM musical. They were still building the bureau
about three weeks before air time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was
testing a microphone. Producers were literally hammering the sign of the bureau
into place. And Daniel Schorr was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS
was like after World War II.' As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship
was leaving, and I knew I had to be on it or get left behind.
</P>
<P>
"Ted (Turner's) master stroke was to install a satellite dish and put CNN in
the offices of Congress. The powerful people in the country turned to CNN the
day shots were fired at Reagan to find out what was happening. Bernie (Shaw)
was the hero of that one. He was the only network anchor not to declare Jim
Brady dead, which was extraordinary given the pressure to do so. The three
established networks had declared him dead, and Dan Rather held a moment of
silence for him. That's when I knew we were on our way."
</P>
<P>
Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst, National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
(Schorr was a CBS News correspondent before being hired as CNN's first
employee. He left in 1985 over a dispute for editorial independence.)
</P>
<P>
"Ted Turner approached me a year before he started CNN. He asked me to join him
at the cable convention in Las Vegas, and then hired me 15 minutes before the
press conference to give legitimacy to what he was going to propose. I didn't
know anything about cable. But as he outlined CNN to me, I saw the vision
there, something inherently viable, a way to give people news 24 hours a day so
that they could turn it on and off like a water tap. I liked the idea of live
coverage as opposed to capsule coverage. I don't know where he got his
conceptions from, because I could tell he didn't know anything about news.
</P>
<P>
"I knew CNN would be a success. What I didn't anticipate was the extent of
CNN's success today. It would have been like asking me to foresee a revolution
in Eastern Europe, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I didn't foresee that
CNN would be seen in hotel rooms around the world. That CNN would be the pearl
in Ted's crown."
</P>
<P>
Cissy Baker, vice president and managing editor
</P>
<P>
"I thought CNN would be successful. I always believed it would be. It was
everybody else I had to convince. That became a second full-time job, really. I
wish I had a tape recorder in the beginning, when I was running the Washington
desk, trying to get an interview with a congressman or official. I would say,
'Hi, this is Cissy Baker. I'm calling from CNN, Cable News Network, Ted
Turner's all-news, 24-hour network, based in Atlanta, Ga., with a bureau here
in Washington. Do you get cable? Let me tell you about cable.' And then after a
while, I would get this, 'I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?' "
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today."
</P>
<P>
(Williams left for NBC last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman.)
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to us we couldn't make this thing appen. In January of 1981,
when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all along
the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to cut
between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing cold
with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this? We
have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some
wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched.
Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
"That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were
manipulating wires by hand.
</P>
<P>
"In the industry, CNN was a quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing
quiet about it. On June 1, 1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time.
Our lead story was live. Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President
Carter walking out of the hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m.
Eastern time, the broadcast networks went on with their evening newscasts, and
their lead story was Carter walking out of the hospital, and the footage said
'Courtesy of CNN' in the corner. That was our first night on the air."

   CNN has decided to allow court transcripts of its
Manuel Noriega prison tapes to be made public without further legal
battles, the network and its attorney said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday the
transcripts could be released Thursday, unless CNN decided to take
the case to a higher court.
   ``CNN has decided not to appeal,'' network attorney Terry
Bienstock said, adding that CNN's primary concern had always been
to protect its confidential source.
   ``We don't think the transcripts in and of themselves will
jeopardize the source,'' he said.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said many of the conversations were
in code, and that without supporting documents, they would not be
meaningful in any case.
   Sanford Bohrer, attorney for four media organizations that asked
for the transcripts, applauded CNN's decision.
   ``I think it was the right decision because Judge Hoeveler's was
the right decision,'' Bohrer said. ``I could never understand how
CNN could claim to own conversations that were taped by the United
States government, of an inmate in a federal prison.''
   The news organizations seeking the tapes were The Miami Herald,
The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami,
Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today, which Gannett owns. They argued the
public has a right to examine the content of tapes that set off a
free-speech controversy that went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   CNN has televised some of the seven tapes at issue and argued
that the recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its
property. CNN accused other news organizations of ``professional
jealousy,'' and said the transcripts should be burned or returned
to the network.
   But the judge's decision ruled the tape transcripts were public
documents because the information was originally compiled by
Noriega and the government, not CNN.
   The tapes controversy began last month when CNN aired a series
of telecasts based on Noriega's telephone conversations somehow
leaked to the network. The judge ordered the telecasts stopped
pending his review of he tapes, a move CNN opposed as
unconstitutional prior restraint of the press.
   The Supreme Court decided not to intervene, and the judge, after
reviewing the transcripts, determined there was no threat to
Noriega's right to a fair trial and said the tapes could be aired.
   CNN hasn't said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that
Panamanians gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through Panama from
Colombia to the United States.

   A federal judge today weighed whether the
transcripts of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls are the
property of CNN or are part of the public record and should be
shared with other news organizations.
   Four news organizations went before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler on Thursday seeking the court transcripts. Cable News
Network fought to keep them secret, accusing other media of trying
to scoop the network with its own story.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Monday.
   Robert Bernius, representing Gannett Co. and its USA Today,
argued that in the wake of Hoeveler's decision on Wednesday to lift
his 3-week-old ban on airing the tapes, the transcripts were of
vital public importance.
   ``We ... want to know why a First Amendment crisis was
precipitated by these tapes,'' Bernius said.
   Gannett and USA Today joined The Miami Herald, The Associated
Press and the Miami-area Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV in the
effort to obtain the transcripts.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the transcripts should be
burned or returned to the network.
   ``This is not a clash of First Amendment rights, it is merely a
display of competitive jealousy,'' CNN said in court papers.
   Bienstock argued that giving them to other media organizations
would be like CNN demanding that the organizations give the network
their own reporters' notes. The transcripts include some tapes that
CNN has never broadcast, he said.
   ``This is again an intrusion into the news-gathering,
news-editing process,'' said Bienstock.
   Sanford Bohrer, another attorney for the four media
organizations, said, ``I think it's unfortunate that CNN feels it's
being put upon by others in the media. The real issue is the
public's right to look at anything it can get its hands on.''
   He noted that the transcripts were made by the court and the
originll tapes were made by the Bureau of Prisons, not CNN.
   Hoeveler interrupted Bienstock frequently and chided CNN for
fighting previously to broadcast the tapes, then opposing release
of the transcripts.
   ``The whole thrust of your case was that you wanted the world to
know what was on the tapes,'' Hoeveler said.
   Bienstock also cited a reporter's right to protect a
confidential source, saying scrutiny of the transcripts could help
reveal who gave the tapes to CNN.
   But the judge noted that the government, through the U.S.
attorney's office, had already seen the transcripts.
   ``In any event,'' he added, I have very little sympathy with
your source. Someone down the line has committed some grave
improprieties.''
   Bernius said those seeking the tapes had no interest in
identifying CNN's source, only in getting ``access to the factual
basis of a landmark judicial determination.''
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   Noriega's attorneys went into court Nov. 8 after learning about
the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to play any that might
interfere with attorney-client privilege. The network aired some
portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew them when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The transcripts then were prepared by court officials in Miami
to aid Hoeveler and attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents
of the tapes.
   On Wednesday, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the
tapes and returned them to the network. CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
has said the network had no immediate plans to play the unaired
tapes in the next few days.
   While CNN won't say where it got the tapes, Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
   One tape broadcast was a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team in which he speculated about whether two Panamanians
captured after the U.S. invasion would testify against him. On
another tape, Noriega appeared to be attempting to transfer $4
million with the help of his mistress' mother.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Noriega Transcripts Public - But Not Yet</HEAD>

   A federal judge ruled today that court transcripts
of tapes acquired by CNN containing prison conversations of Manuel
Noriega should be made public, but he didn't release them
immediately.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler issued the decision after
four media organizations asked for access to the court documents
last week, saying the public had a right to know the factual basis
of a case that tested the constitutional limits of prior restraint.
   The judge said he would not release the transcripts until
Thursday to allow CNN time to appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said he did not immediately know
whether the network would appeal.
   Bienstock argued earlier that releasing the transcripts would be
an ``intrusion into the news-gathering and news-editing process.''
.
   In his 18-page decision, Hoeveler chided CNN for first fighting
to televise the tapes and then seeking to keep the transcripts from
being used by other news organizations.
   The judge said it ``comes as somewhat of a surprise to have CNN,
the forceful proponent of a free press operating without judicial
intervention, return to this court urging that the press and public
be denied a right of access to the very information which CNN has
argued is of immediate public interest.''
   Hoeveler dismissed CNN's contention that it owned the content of
the tapes, saying it was the U.S. government that monitored
Noriega's prison conversations and recorded them, not CNN.
   Karen Kammer, an attorney representing the four media
organizations said she was pleased with the ruling. The
organizations are The Miami Herald, The Associated Press,
Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA
Today, which Gannett owns.
   ``I think the court has recognized that the content of the tapes
does not belong to CNN, as we had argued,'' she said.
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator's attorneys went into court Nov.
8 after learning about the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
play any that might interfere with attorney-client privilege. The
network played some portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew
them when a federal appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review. Transcripts then
were prepared by court officials in Miami to aid Hoeveler and
attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents of the tapes.
   Last week, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the tapes
and returned them to the network, but they were not immediately
aired.
   CNN has not said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

   CNN said it is giving up the fight to prevent the
release of court transcripts of its Manuel Noriega prison tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, said
Tuesday they would be released today unless CNN appealed. On
Wednesday, CNN said it would not do so.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But after reviewing the transcripts, network officials decided
there was little danger of compromising those sources, he said.
   CNN has televised some of seven tape recordings of Noriega's
jailhouse conversations with his legal team and had argued that the
recordings of the telephone calls, and therefore the transcripts of
them, were its property.
   Sanford Bohrer, the attorney for the news organizations that
asked for the transcripts, applauded CNN's decision to drop the
fight.
   ``I could never understand how CNN could claim to own
conversations that were taped by the United States government, of
an inmate in a federal prison,'' he said.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges he took $4.6 million in
payoffs to allow safe shipment of cocaine through Panama to the
United States.
   The organizations seeking the transcripts were The Miami Herald,
the Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and
Gannett Co. and its USA Today. They argued that the public has a
right to examine the content of the tapes, which were at the center
of a freedom-of-the-press dispute.
   The controversy began last month when CNN aired a series of
telecasts based on the recordings, which it said were provided by
an anonymous source.
   Hoeveler ordered the telecasts stopped while he determined
whether the action threatened Noriega's right to a fair trial. CNN
opposed the move as an unconstitutional prior restraint on the
press, but the Supreme Court refused to intervene.
   Hoeveler eventually ruled that the tapes didn't jeopardize the
case and could be aired.
   CNN hasn't said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
have claimed they were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that
Panama gave them to CNN.

   CNN got the scoop on Manuel Noriega's taped phone
calls but no longer has an exclusive on the story.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday that
transcripts of the tapes will be made public Thursday unless CNN
appeals.
   He ruled in favor of four news organizations that had argued the
transcripts were part of the public record and that the public had
a right to know the facts behind a case that had tested the limits
of freedom of the press.
   CNN had sought to retain exclusive use of the tapes, accusing
the other news organizations of trying to steal their story.
   ``The content never was and never will be CNN's,'' said Sanford
Bohrer, an attorney for the four news organizations: The Miami
Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of
Miami and Gannett Co. and its USA Today.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had not decided
whether to appeal.
   He said the judge broke new ground by deciding that material
used in closed court hearings could be made public.
   ``To the extent it benefits all media, CNN's pleased about
that,'' Bienstock said. ``But we still see this as a continued
breach of the news-gathering process, by allowing access to
information gathered under a promise of confidentiality.''
   CNN has broadcast some of the seven tapes and argued that the
recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its property. The
network said the transcripts should be burned or returned to CNN.
   Hoeveler disagreed, saying CNN ``did not interview Noriega to
obtain the conversations, nor did it record the conversations.''
   The tapes contain conversations between the deposed Panamanian
dictator, who awaits trial on drug-trafficking charges, and his
defense team. His lawyers accuse the government of leaking the
recordings made by prison authorities.
   After CNN aired one of the tapes last month, Noriega attorney
Frank Rubino argued that the recordings violate Noriega's
attorney-client privilege, and Hoeveler on Nov. 8 barred the
network from further such broadcasts.
   But CNN aired a tape anyway the next day, saying the First
Amendment forbids prior restraint of the media.
   CNN stopped the telecasts after a federal appeals court upheld
the judge's ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court, on a 7-2 vote, refused
to intervene.
   CNN then submitted the tapes to Hoeveler, who had the
transcripts made. After all sides examined them in secret, the
judge found the tapes did not prejudice Noriega's defense and said
the network could air them.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

   Some of Manuel Noriega's taped prison conversations
were in code, including passages in which the deposed Panamanian
dictator apparently discussed frozen funds, court transcripts show.
   Many of the conversations included in transcripts released by a
federal judge Thursday dealt with family affairs, but some
apparently involved money transfers and others showed Noriega
followed Panamanian politics after he was ousted during a U.S.
invasion in December 1989. Among the apparently coded calls was one
by Noriega to the Cuban Embassy in Panama.
   The government tapes, some of which were broadcast by CNN last
month, triggered a battle pitting freedom of the press against
Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   After first ordering CNN to halt the broadcasts, U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler ruled last week that the tapes were harmless
to Noriega's defense, and allowed the network to resume the
broadcasts.
   This week, the judge agreed to a request by media organizations
to release court transcripts of the tapes, over the objections of
CNN. The network dropped its objections Wednesday.
   In one transcript, Norma Amado, mother of Noriega's mistress,
talked in apparent code with him about why ``the man'' had not
arrived. The conversation appeared to be about frozen funds.
   Amado said the man would go elsewhere because ``it's not frozen
there ... since we are all frozen here and over there it wouldn't
be a problem.''
   She also discussed the need for ``a good towel ... and the
important thing is it shouldn't be a hand (towel.)''
   CNN has said that conversation also included coded discussions
about the transfer of $4 million.
   In a call to the Cuban Embassy, Noriega said he would send a
facsimile transmission ``so you can grab it and pass it on to the
grandfather.''
   Another transcript had Noriega urging an unidentified man to
encourage opposition to the new Panamanian government.
   ``We must explain ... that one must unite, that there are people
with ambition that are now going to take over the party,'' he said.
   The transcripts included five tapes, most containing several
conversations.
   In one previously telecast conversation, Noriega speculated
about two potential government witnesses with his lawyer's
secretary, who was translating for a defense investigator. That
conversation triggered the original objection by Noriega's
attorneys, who said broadcastingit would violate lawyer-client
privilege and hurt his chances of getting a fair trial.
   The transcripts showed that Noriega was commenting on an article
in El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language edition of The Miami
Herald, about the arrest of the two men, Alfredo Sanchez and Felipe
Camargo.
   The news organizations that went to court for the transcripts
were The Miami Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station
WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today, which Gannett
owns. They argued that the public has a right to examine the
content of tapes that ignite a free-speech controversy.
   Noriega's defense team claims the Panamanian government gave the
tapes to CNN after receiving them from the U.S. government. Taping
prisoners telephone callsis legal.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges the he
took $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing
through Panama from Colombia to the United States.

<TEXT>
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said Dec. 5 it was
eliminating 1,100 jobs and cutting newscasts and other programming
to save $108 million.
   The shortfall is due to government funding cuts, inflation,
declining television advertising, and such other costs as new taxes
and pension funding, said CBC President Gerard Veilleux.
   The cuts represent just under 10 percent of CBC's $1.2 billion
annual budget. About $900 million of that comes from government and
the rest from ad revenue. CBC employs about 10,000 people, and the
layoffs are its worst ever.
   Veilleux said at a news conference that the cuts go into effect
April 1, but some effects will be felt immediately.
   ``These decisions have given me many sleepless nights,'' he told
CBC employees during a closed-circuit televised announcement. ``I
can only trust we're doing the right thing.''
   As part of the cuts, the CBC has decided it can no longer afford
the $20 million annual cost to run Radio Canada International, the
international shortwave radio service, or the $4.5-million cost of
the English and French parliamentary channels, which broadcast
House of Commons proceedings. CBC will ask the government to pick
up the tab for tese operations.
   In addition, English and French radio network budgets will be
cut by 1 percent. The following year, 2 percent will be trimmed
from their budgets.
   Newsworld, CBC's all-news cable channel, is not supposed to be
affected. However, many of its news items originate at regional
stations that will be closed.

<HEAD>Former Panamanian Diplomat Reportedly Focus of Tapes Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI investigation into who leaked tapes of
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls focuses on a political opponent
who might testify against the deposed Panamanian dictator,
newspapers reported.
   The FBI believes the source of the leak appears to be Jose
Blandon, once an intelligence officer in Panama for Noriega and the
country's former consul general in New York, The Miami Herald and
The Washington Post reported, quoting unidentified sources.
   Blandon denied leaking the government tapes. In an interview
published Dec. 9 in The Post, Blandon said someone in the U.S.
government who wants to sabotage the Noriega trial must have been
responsible.
   ``Somebody in the government was leaking them,'' Blandon said.
Drug enforcement agents were present whenever he had access to the
tapes, and he was allowed to make only written notes, Blandon said.
   The FBI is trying to determine who gave the tapes to Cable News
Network, which aired some of Noriega's conversations from prison
over the past month. The broadcasts were halted briefly while a
federal judge decided whether Noriega's right to a fair trial would
be jeopardized. After reviewing the tapes, the judge decided to let
CNN broadcast them.
   In a related matter, the Justice Department is refusing to
return documents belonging to a CNN reporter, saying they may be
evidence in an investigation of the leaked recordings.
   The Justice Department filed a brief Dec. 3 with the U.S.
District Court in Atlanta opposing a motion by CNN for return of
the documents.
   The materials were in a box taken from a hotel room that
reporter Marlene Fernandez had been staying in. The FBI confiscated
the box after hotel officials, apparently thinking Fernandez had
checked out, reported it as abandoned property.
   The Justice Department said it kept 15 documents and returned
all the other items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and
five videotape cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   In another development, the network said Dec. 5 it was dropping
its fight to prevent the release of court transcripts of the
Noriega tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, had
said they would be released unless CNN appealed.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts

<HEAD>Head of Japanese Public TV Wants Global News Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Japan's public broadcasting system said
he wants to create a global news network to counter the spread of
Cable News Network to dozens of countries.
   ``I don't mean to bad-mouth Mr. Turner, but CNN is trying to
force U.S. news on the rest of the world,'' NHK Chairman Keiji
Shima said Dec. 3, referring to CNN head Ted Turner.
   Uder Shima's plan, broadcasters from Asia, Europe and North
America would be responsible for eight-hour daily segments focusing
on their own region.
   Shima said he believed Asians should cover issues about Asia,
but he did not give a detailed explanation why. He also said there
was not enough news about the region being broadcast to other parts
of the globe.
   Shima, in a speech to foreign reporters, acknowledged that the
British Broadcasting Corp. has shown little interest in his
proposal. But he said other major broadcasters have expressed
interest.
   He did not identify those broadcasters, however, and an NHK
spokeswoman said the names could not be released because
negotiations were under way.
   Shima provided no concrete details of his plan, but said he
hoped such a network could be set up in about six months.
   NHK has two channels on Japanese television, one with general
programming and the other featuring educational fare. It also has
two stations for satellite broadcasting. The programming on those
stations includes news broadcasts from several countries.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a cost-saving experiment that may be tried
elsewhere overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a
bureau and satellite equipment in Berlin, a CNN official said
Friday.
   The test will start in mid-June and is a ``a limited
experiment'' in which the two organizations will maintain separate
news correspondents and producers, said Ed Turner, executive vice
president of CNN.
   Turner's comments came during a telephone interview about the
upcoming 10th anniversary of CNN.
   CBS News officials would not comment on the unique sharing of
office space with a still-growing cable rival. ``We have no
announcement to make,'' said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman.
   The Berlin bureau arrangement marks the second deal between CBS
and a company owned by Atlanta cable tycoon Ted Turner, who
unsuccessfully tried to buy CBS in 1986.
   Last September, Turner Network Television announced a $50
million contract with CBS that lets TNT show 50 hours of coverage
from the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS owns the U.S.
television rights to those Games.
   The CNN-CBS News arrangement in Berlin is ``really more symbolic
than anything else,'' said Ed Turner, who is not related to CNN's
owner.
   What is unusual about it is two rival TV news organizations
``cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a (satellite) feed
point and saving each other a little money,'' he said. ``And we'll
see where it goes from there.''
   Asked if there might be similar CBS-CNN arrangements elsewhere
overseas, Turner replied that ``we're looking at some, but right
now there's nothing to talk about.''
   The cost-saving effort comes at a time that all the major
networks are trying to find ways to reduce or share costs of news
coverage overseas.
   Several years ago, NBC bought nearly 38 percent of Visnews, a
London-based overseas TV news service. Visnews' majority owner is
the Reuters news company, but the British Broadcasting Corp. also
owns an 11.25 percent interest.
   NBC and Visnews recently began sharing the same office in
Moscow, and the BBC uses NBC's satellite equipment there to
transmit stories to London, NBC said.
   ABC owns 45 percent of another London-based overseas TV news
service, Worldwide Television News. Subscribers to the service
include ABC News, CBS News and CNN.

   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network
agreed today to cool off their constitutional showdown, at least
until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue of tape-recorded
conversations.
   Under the agreement, Noriega will not ask for contempt penalties
as long as CNN continues to refrain from broadcasting tapes between
the deposed Panamanian leader and his lawyers.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but once
again warned CNN, noting that over the weekend the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta had backed his original gag
order.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN's attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the
deal, but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they
did not include conversations with his lawyers. The judge agreed.
   In Atlanta, where the network is based, CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said that the network expects to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week.
   Constitutional law experts said the confrontation could become a
landmark case.
   CNN had defied an order Friday by Hoeveler by broadcasting an
excerpt in which the deposed Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for defense lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Saturday, Haworth said. Later Saturday, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges. That order was also stayed by today's agreement.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find the Atlanta-based network in
direct civil contempt and fine the network $300,000 for each time
it televised the tapes and each time it shows them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies, called the CNN case ``an astonishing illustration of
censorship,'' but said the network was ``playing with blasting
caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN president Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''

U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, in Miami, ruled that transcripts of
prison-taped conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and his lawyers, which led
to a showdown in court between the defense attorneys and Cable News Network,
are public property.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler's decision answered other news organizations' demands for access to
the transcripts. The Miami Herald, Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station
WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today had claimed that the public
has a right to the facts behind a case that tested 1st Amendment protection
against restraint of the press. CNN lawyer Terry Bienstock said the network had
not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.

A federal appeals court Saturday upheld an injunction barring Cable News
Network from airing taped jailhouse conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and
his defense team after the government claimed that the broadcasts will
jeopardize the deposed Panamanian dictator's right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based network said it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals came after the Justice
Department filed a brief arguing that the broadcasts could hinder selection of
an unbiased jury for Noriega's drug-trafficking trial.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the government argued that, because the tapes of Noriega's
telephone conversations could divulge details of his defense strategy, his
right to effective counsel could be compromised.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot at this point be more specific with respect to the
possible harm that could flow from publication of the tapes because the
government, like the district court, does not know the contents of the
materials CNN has in its possession," the brief stated.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, meanwhile, CNN asked U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who on
Thursday had banned the playing of the tapes, to disqualify himself from
hearing motions relating to the case.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys Friday that it would be in contempt of court if
it broadcast more tapes, but the network aired them anyway, arguing that
Hoeveler's order amounted to unconstitutional prior restraint.
</P>
<P>
The appeals panel in Atlanta called on the network to produce the tapes in
Hoeveler's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
"The 1st Amendment interests and public will best be served by immediate
production of the tapes . . . so that the district court can conduct the
difficult balancing of constitutional rights," the panel said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's ruling heats up the battle between the network and the courts --
pitting CNN's concerns over its 1st Amendment rights against the Justice
Department's efforts to convict Noriega, who is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami. He has been there since shortly after he
surrendered to U.S. troops who invaded Panama last December.
</P>
<P>
"CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's reasonable
request to review the audiotapes it has in its possession," the appeals court
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the ruling Saturday, Tom Johnson, CNN president, said that
network attorneys "are reviewing the decision" and that CNN "will pursue an
immediate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Hoeveler convened a special Saturday afternoon session of the
district court to hear a motion by Noriega's attorney, Frank A. Rubino, that
CNN be held in contempt for airing the telephone tapes.
</P>
<P>
That hearing was quickly derailed, however, when CNN attorney Terry S.
Bienstock asked Hoeveler to disqualify himself from hearing any matters related
to CNN's broadcast of the Noriega tapes. He cited "personal bias and prejudice"
based on "extra-judicial statements" Hoeveler made to reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
On his way out of the courthouse parking lot Friday, Hoeveler had indicated to
a CNN reporter that he would find the network in contempt for airing more
Noriega tapes in defiance of his orders.
</P>
<P>
CNN's motion to dismiss Hoeveler from ruling on the tapes will be considered
today or Monday by presiding U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King.
</P>
<P>
The taped telephone conversations, in which Noriega and his defense team
discussed two potential government witnesses and speculated on prosecution
strategy, have fueled assertions that, although Noriega is jailed in America,
he still has power in Panama.
</P>
<P>
In Panama City, La Prensa, the city's largest newspaper, warned Saturday that
Noriega's ability to make telephone calls is a sign that he could be plotting
to overthrow the pro-American government of President Guillermo Endara.

<TEXT>
   Cable News Network is asking the Supreme Court
to let it broadcast tape recordings of deposed Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers from his
Florida jail cell.
   The justices today were awaiting responses from Noriega and the
Bush administration to the emergency CNN request and are unlikely
to act on the matter before next week.
   Meanwhile, the FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes in
Atlanta and was checking whether they were recordings of Noriega.
CNN protested that the tapes were obtained without a warrant and
demanded they be returned.
   The network said the material was taken from a room that been
occupied by one of its reporters at the Omni Hotel, part of a
complex that also houses CNN's offices. A security firm had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, CNN said.
   CNN's lawyers on Thursday asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to
set aside a federal judge's order banning the broadcasts. Kennedy,
who handles such emergency matters from Florida, promptly referred
the case to the full court.
   Lawyers for Noriega and the administration were urged to reply
to the network's arguments by noon Saturday.
   The justices could act on the matter over the weekend but may
decide to take some more time to study it.
   ``CNN has been restrained indefinitely from telecasting news of
great importance to the public,'' lawyers for the network said.
``Balanced against this irreparable harm to the First Amendment,
CNN and the public are speculative threats to interests that can be
otherwise protected.''
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars CNN from broadcasting
at least some portions of the seven tapes until Hoeveler can
determine whether the broadcasts would endanger Noriega's right to
a fair trial.
   CNN refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler but did agree not
to broadcast tapes of Noriega talking to his lawyers until
receiving some word from the Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender shortly after the U.S.
invasion of Panama last December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state that they
are talking to their lawyers.
   In addition to the emergency request, CNN's lawyers filed a
formal appeal with the full Supreme Court that seeks to have the
justices declare Hoeveler's order an unconstitutional prior
restraint on free speech.
   The network's lawyers said Noriega's rights to a fair trial have
been jeopardized by the government's taping of his conversations,
not by any CNN action.
   ``Gagging CNN will neither cure nor avoid any breach by the
prosecution,'' the lawyers said. ``It will serve only to punish a
news medium which has faithfully executed its constitutional role
by reporting on criminal proceedings and allegations of unlawful
government action.''
   A series of Supreme Court decisions has greatly limited judges'
power to issue such ``gag orders'' to safeguard fair trial rights.
   In a 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down an order
issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a Nebraska
murder case.
   In that case, the court said such prior restraints may be used
only as a last resort and that judges always must first consider
less-drastic measures.

   Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network declared a
cease-fire Monday, agreeing to postpone their constitutional
showdown over taped conversations until the U.S. Supreme Court
rules on the issue.
   Under the deal is worked out in federal court, CNN must refrain
from playing any tapes between the imprisoned former Panamanian
leader and his attorneys.
   In return, Noriega's defense delayed a request for contempt
penalties of up to $300,000 per broadcast against the network. U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler also delayed his order demanding
that CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   ``Our concern is to keep General Noriega from being denied a
fair trial,'' defense attorney Jon May said. ``I'm not here to
squeeze blood out of CNN.''
   He said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the
Supreme Court to focus on the broader constitutional question
balancing protections of the attorney-client privilege and freedom
of speech.
   Noriega's attorneys Saturday asked the judge to find CNN in
contempt after the network defied his court order and televised a
contested tape.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the deal,
but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they did
not include conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   The Atlanta-based network is expected to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week, a CNN spokesman said.
   ``We agreed that CNN would not air, pending Supreme Court
review, any attorney-client conversations that it has in its
possession,'' network attorney Terry Bienstock said. ``We just want
the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the Supreme
Court.''
   Federal prosecutors have remained on the sidelines during the
CNN-Noriega dispute, but U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday
he supports the gag order.
   ``These tapes should not be played under the fair-trial
concept,'' Lehtinen told the judge.
   May said Monday's deal stops the clock on the contempt
penalties, but does not prevent the defense from later asking for
fines against CNN.
   Although attention has focused on the media, May said there are
also other potential parties to the dispute.
   ``There's a whole bunch of people in the U.S. who may have these
tapes, including the State Department and the CIA,'' he said. Lead
Noriega attorney Frank Rubino has said the tapes were leaked to CNN
by a Panamanian official who received them from the State
Department.
   Rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges
against Noriega based on government misconduct in recording the
calls made from the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but took note of CNN's one-day
defiance of his previous gag order. He emphasized that over the
weekend the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta backed
his original ban on broadcasting the conversations.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN had defied the order by broadcasting an excerpt Friday night
and Saturday in which the deposed Panamanian ruler spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for Rubino. On the tape, Noriega speculated that
the government would use as witnesses against him two men who
surrendered to U.S. troops in Panama.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held near Miami
since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly after the invasion of
Panama in December.

   Cable News Network today handed over to a federal
judge tapes of Manuel Noriega talking on the telephone from his
prison cell.
   After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate
William C. Turnoff.
   CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order
barring the network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were
broadcast before an appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
the order.
   Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal
magistrate so that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's
drug-trafficking trial, is not ``tainted'' by any disclosures about
Noriega's defense strategy.
   Noriega's attorneys claim the tapes disclose defense maneuvers
and have damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a
fair trial.
   Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and
translated from Spanish, then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler
said he didn't know how long that would take.
   The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage
Noriega's right to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a
permanent ban on further broadcasts, CNN can again appeal,
eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are confident that when Magistrate Turnoff reviews these
tapes and reports to the judge, CNN will be found not to have
violated the court order,'' said Steven Korn, lawyer for Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner.
   Korn said the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   On Monday, a Noriega attorney, Jon May, also said he would ask
for an immediate contempt hearing aimed at forcing CNN to pay fines
of up to $300,000 for each violation of the judge's order. He said
he would ask the all-news network for a log of how many times it
aired the tapes.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that General Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said of his proposal that fines against CNN be used for
Noriega's attorneys.
   CNN's attorney said the network doesn't expect to pay any fines.
He said that the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   The fines could help solve another problem plaguing the defense
- a freeze on Noriega's bank accounts that has kept him from paying
his lawyers.
   The private attorneys have said they cannot stay on the case
without some money. Hoeveler said last week he would decide soon
whether to give Noriega government-paid counsel instead.
   The dispute over the tapes has raised questions about
attorney-client confidentiality, the right to a fair trial and the
First Amendment.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.

   A federal judge, frustrated by delays in paying
Manuel Noriega's attorneys, said today he will appoint two
government-paid defense attorneys if their fee problem is not
resolved by Friday.
   ``It is obvious that we simply may not be able to unfreeze any
money,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said during a hearing
on the fees.
   In June, Hoeveler ordered prosecutors to unfreeze about $6
million in 27 Noriega-linked bank accounts for use by the Noriega's
private lawyers.
   But five months later, defense lawyers have not received a
penny, and today they asked Hoeveler to light a fire under the U.S.
government and banks in France, Switzerland and Austria, to release
the funds.
   But Justice Department attorney Drew Arena told the judge that
the foreign governments had frozen the accounts for their own
investigations and have so far refused to release them despite the
U.S. government's request.
   The problem is the United States had alleged the money was drug
proceeds, but was now reversing course by asking that it be given
to Noriega, Arena said.
   ``It's rather, your honor, like trying to `unring' a bell,''
Arena said.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino accused the U.S. State
Department of undermining efforts to unfreeze the funds by
encouraging foreign governments to act on their own. Hoeveler,
however, said he was frustrated by the delays and wanted the case
to proceed as quickly as possible.
   The judge has agreed that the trial will not begin Jan. 28, but
said it will not be delayed by much.
   Under the law covering court-appointed counsel, the attorneys
could receive only a maximum of $60 an hour, far less than the $350
an hour Noriega's attorneys have said they needed.
   Meanwhile, Noriega and Cable News Network have agreed to let the
U.S. Supreme Court decide whether the deposed Panamanian dictator's
tape-recorded conversations with his lawyers can be broadcast.
   CNN aire excerpts of one tape over the weekend in defiance of
Hoeveler.
   The defense and the network agreed Monday to suspend their feud
until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether CNN's free-press
rights outweigh Noriega's right to a fair trial. The network
planned to file the appeal this week.
   ``I will be interested in seeing what the Supreme Court will do
in this novel situation,'' Hoeveler said.
   The Atlanta-based network agreed not to play any of the disputed
tapes until the Supreme Court rules. In return, Noriega's defense
delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to $300,000 per
broadcast against the network, and Hoeveler stayed his order that
CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had the right to
play other Noriega tapes as long as they did not include
conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   CNN defied Hoeveler by broadcasting on Friday and Saturday an
excerpt of a tape in which Noriega spoke in Spanish with a defense
attorney's secretary, who translated for his defense team. On the
tape, Noriega speculated that the government would use as witnesses
against him two Panamanians in U.S. custody.
   Rubino has said he will seek dismissal of all charges against
Noriega, alleging government misconduct in recording the calls made
from the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami.
   Noriega has been held there since his surrender to U.S. forces
shortly after the invasion of Panama in December. He is accused of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes to protect the cocaine trade.

   A federal appeals court on Saturday upheld an
injunction barring Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also called on the
Atlanta-based network to produce the seven tapes in U.S. District
Court in Miami so the court could decide whether the broadcasts
would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   The ruling came after CNN on Friday defied Judge William
Hoeveler in Miami, broadcasting excerpts from the tapes minutes
after the judge issued an order instructing the network not to do
so.
   CNN said it would appeal Saturday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We will be pursuing an immediate appeal,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said in a telephone interview. Haworth said he didn't know
yet if CNN would continue televising excerpts of the tapes.
   The appeals panel denied CNN's appeal of Hoeveler's 10-day
injunction against broadcasting excerpts of Noreiga's phone calls
from federal jail.
   It called on the network to produce the tapes in Hoeveler's
courtroom so that the trial judge can determine if Noriega's Sixth
Amendment rights to a fair trial have been violated by the U.S.
government and CNN.
   ``The First Amendment interests of the press and public will
best be served by immediate production of the tapes held by CNN so
that the district court can conduct the difficult balancing of
constititional rights,'' the appeals court said.
   ``CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's
reasonable request to review the audiotapes it has in its
possession,'' the court said.
   The Justice Department on Saturday morning filed a brief with
the appeals court, claiming the tapes could make it difficult to
select an unbiased jury for Noriega's trial.
   Noriega's right to a fair trial and effective counsel also could
be compromised if details of the defense strategy are revealed to
prosecutors, the brief said.
   ``The government cannot at this point be more specific with
respect to the possible harm that could flow from publication of
the tapes because the government, like the district court, does not
know the contents of the materials CNN has in its possession,'' the
brief states.
   On Friday, Hoeveler said he would hold CNN in contempt of court
if it disregarded his order. But in an unusual interview with CNN
outside the courtroom Friday night, the judge said he could not
rule on contempt without a prosecutors' motion.
   On Saturday afternoon, Noriega attorney Frank Rubino asked
Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and fine the network
$300,000 for each time it had televised the tapes and each time it
shows them in future.
   Before Hoeveler could respond, CNN attorney Terry Beinstock
asked the judge to disqualify himself, accusing the judge of
revealing a personal bias against the network in the CNN interview
on Friday night.
   In the interview, a CNN reporter asked Hoeveler if he planned to
find CNN in contempt.
   ``That remains to be seen,'' the judge said. Asked why, the
judge replied, ``Well, somebody's going to have to move for that
and they (CNN) obviously are in contempt at the moment. The legal
proceedings will take place when somebody moves for sanctions.''
   In Miami, federal district Chief Judge James Lawrence King said
Saturday the motion seeking to disqualify Hoeveler from
consideration of the contempt issue ``will be handled in the
orderly manner prescribed for such situations.'' He would not
comment further.
   A tape CNN played Friday contained a brief conversation in
Spanish between Noriega and Rubino's secretary, said to be acting
as a translator for the English-speaking defense team.
   CNN provided an on-screen English translation and narration in
English that made it impossible to hear the actual exchange.
   CNN said the secretary told Noriega two people have been
arrested in Panama and says he should determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   Noriega says he knows only one of the people.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,'' CNN
translated Noriega as saying. ``It says they are trying to induce
any of the two of them to testify before the court against me.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were Felipe Camargo,
a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in Panama who had been the
general's top liaison with the Cubans, and Alfredo Sanchez, whom
The Miami Herald identified Saturday as a convicted drug smuggler
once employed by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.
   Other tapes played Friday included conversations between Noriega
and his supporters, including a discussion with his mistress'
mother about the transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel in exchange for letting drugs
move safely through Panama to the United States.
   He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside
Miami since shortly after surrendering to U.S. soldiers who invaded
his country in December.

<HEAD>Justice Department Opposes Return of Some CNN Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department argues that documents
Cable News Network wants returned may become evidence in the
investigation of the leak of Manuel Noriega's taped prison
telephone calls.
   The court filing by the department on Monday did not say how the
15 documents might be such evidence.
   The documents include a list of telephone numbers apparently
compiled by CNN reporter Marlene Fernandez, the Justice Department
said.
   CNN's Nov. 8 broadcast about Noriega's conversations with his
attorneys and others from a federal prison near Miami triggered a
legal dispute over the network's right to air the tapes.
   The Supreme Court last month upheld a federal judge's temporary
order barring CNN from airing any tapes of conversations between
the deposed Panamanian dictator and his lawyers pending a court
review of the material.
   Last week, the temporary ban was lifted by William M. Hoeveler,
the judge who is presiding over Noriega's drug conspiracy case in
Miami.
   CNN, which played a segment of one conversation in defiance of
Hoeveler's order, has so far not aired any other conversations.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is conducting a criminal
investigation into the theft of the tapes, which defense lawyers
say compromised Noriega's ability to get a fair trial.
   In its filing Monday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, the
Justice Department opposed a motion by CNN for the return of the 15
documents that FBI agents kept following a search of a box
containing material used by Ms. Fernandez in preparing her
broadcasts.
   The box was found abandoned Nov. 12 in a room at the Omni Hotel
and turned over to the hotel's lost and found department.
   The Justice Department noted that it had returned all the other
items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and five videotape
cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   Copies of the 15 documents the FBI agents kept have also been
furnished to CNN lawyers, the Justice Department said.
   ``All of these 15 documents relate to the FBI's investigation
into the theft of government property,'' the department said in its
brief.
   FBI agent Jeffrey B. Lang said in an affidavit attached to the
pleadings that ``it is entirely likely that in any subsequent
prosecution, the items may well be introduced into evidence.''
   Besides a piece of paper marked ``telephone numbers,'' the
seized material includes a ``Noriega Tapes'' script, several sets
of Noriega transcripts and descriptions of recordings.

   A federal judge today lifted his ban against Cable
News Network's broadcast of Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls to
his legal team.
   The ban on CNN's use of the tape had sparked a fierce
constitutional debate, pitting the right of free speech against the
right to a fair trial.
   ``The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them,''
said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler during a morning hearing.
   Noriega's attorney Frank Rubino said he no longer had any
objection to CNN's use of the tapes. The only tape he challenged
was a conversation between Noriega and his defense team which had
already been broadcast by CNN.
   ``It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is
out,'' Rubino said today.
   The judge also ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop its
practice of sharing tape-recorded conversations in the Noriega case
with other government agencies.
   Hoeveler last month temporarily barred CNN from using parts of
taped conversations between Noriega and his attorneys, who said
airing the tapes would destroy the ousted Panamanian dictator's
defense against drug charges.
   CNN broadcast some tapes, including a conversation between
Noriega and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for
Rubino's investigator.
   An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the
order, and CNN last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to
Hoeveler for review.
   In Atlanta, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said it was doubtful
that CNN would broadcast any of the tapes today.
   Rubino, after the hearing, said he still intended to ask for
contempt penalties against CNN for airing the tapes despite
Hoeveler's order.
   Steven Korn, attorney for CNN parent Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., said the network contended from the beginning that prior
restraint was wrong.
   ``It's fizzled. No prior restraint is ever appropriate,'' Korn
said outside the courtroom. He also said he considered the contempt
issue moot.
   Korn emphasized the judge's order to the Bureau of Prisons,
saying that was the correct approach to dealing with the taping of
Noriega's phone calls.
   Noreiga, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their lawyers.
   The government has maintained that Noriega knew the calls were
being taped and that the calls were not protected by the
attorney-client privelege.
   Information from the Noriega tapes already is in the hands of at
least one additional party, the government of Panama, according to
an affidavit filed Tuesday by that nation's attorney in the United
States, Gregory Craig.
   The affidavit sought to persuade another judge hearing Panama's
$6.5 billion racketeering lawsuit against the deposed dictator to
freeze all Noriega's assets.
   Craig refused to disclose how he obtained information about the
taped conversations, but the affidavit appeared to include
information not broadcast by CNN.
   Noriega's attorneys have alleged that the U.S. government made
the tapes and supplied them to Panama, which in turn leaked them to
CNN, but Craig refused to comment.
   The affidavit said tapes of Noriega's calls show that ``while in
custody, he has been using the telephone for the purpose of moving
assets wrongfully obtained by him that are the property of the
republic of Panama.''
   Noriega spoke on the tapes to his daughter Sandra Noriega, his
mistress Vicki Amado, his mistress's mother and seven others,
including former pro-Noriega presidential candidate Carlos Duque,
the documents said.
   Noriega ``directed and continues to direct the movement of
assets'' from Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Australia and Brazil;
the funds were moved to banks in Europe as well as through Costa
Rica to Panama, Craig said.
   Craig would not say how much money was involved in the taped
conversations, but added, ``We've said from the beginning that we
think there is $300 million to $500 million of assets out there.''
   Noriega's attorney in the civil case, Stephen Zukoff, disputed
the legality of Craig's affidavit during hearing Tuesday before
U.S. District Judge Edward Davis, who is presiding over the civil
case. ``I don't know where he's getting his information from - he
certainly should have identified it,'' Zukoff said.
   He said he could not discuss whether the information was
accurate without examining it further.
   During the hearing, John Kester, another attorney for Panama,
noted the tapes appeared to show Noriega was moving money from one
account to another while telling Hoeveler he had no assets and
could not pay his attorneys.
   ``He can't have it both ways,'' Kester said.
   Hoeveler has said he will appoint government-paid defense
attorneys if the fee dispute is not settled soon.

<HEAD>Scholar: Noriega Tapes Case Casts Shadow on Press Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of the Manuel Noriega tapes casts a shadow
over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his
order blocking their broadcast, a constitutional scholar says.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler brought one legal battle
between Noriega and Cable News Network to a close Wednesday when he
lifted his 3-week-old order barring CNN from airing tapes of the
former dictator's jailhouse phone calls.
   Rodney Smolla, head of the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at
William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said he was
disturbed that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene earlier
to throw out the judge's order and that the high court will not get
another chance to review the order.
   ``It died with a whimper and I think it's unfortunate the case
ended this way,'' he said. ``It left on the books precedents that
cast some doubt on First Amendment protections that many people
thought were well settled.''
   Noriega's attorneys said they will still ask for contempt
penalties against CNN for broadcasting excerpts the day after
Hoeveler's ban.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino also has requested that all
charges against Noriega be dropped on grounds the taping, a dispute
over Noriega's legal fees and other alleged government misconduct
ruined his chances of a fair trial.
   A decision on that request awaits, among other things, the
outcome of an FBI investigation into how the tapes were leaked.
   The judge lifted his order after he and attorneys reviewed
transcripts of seven tapes the network submitted last week.
   During Wednesday's hearing, Rubino withdrew his request to stop
the broadcasts, saying the only tape that appeared to violate
attorney-client privilege already had been broadcast. ``It does no
good to close the barn door after the horse is out,'' he said.
   Prosecutors also said they had no objection to lifting the ban,
again insisting Noriega's rights were never violated by the taping.
   Later Wednesday, CNN broadcast portions of the previously aired
tape. Spokesman Steve Haworth said the network had no immediate
plans to air the others.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the judge's decision would allow
the network to pursue its story on the government's taping of
Noriega's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said.
   Scholars said the possible precedents from the case include
allowing prior restraint of news reporting, something most believed
to be strictly prohibited by the First Amendment.
   ``The fact that the Supreme Court has tolerated this gag order
for this length of time will unfortunately send a sign to judges
and lawyers around the country that a little prior restraint is
OK,'' said Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press.
   Rubino said the Drug Enforcement Administration or State
Department leaked the tapes to the government of Panama, which in
turn gave them to CNN. He said he wants the source of the leak
identified.
   ``We had to go along the road and put out fires - now we're
going after the pyromaniacs that started the fires,'' Rubino said.
   To head off more leaks, Hoeveler also ruled that the Bureau of
Prisons, which routinely records inmate conversations for security
reasons, cannot share any of Noriega's tapes with other agencies
without the judge's permission.
   The tape that touched off the dispute was of a conversation
between Noriega and one of Rubino's investigators, with the
lawyer's Spanish-speaking secretary serving as an interpreter. In
the conversation, Noriega is asked about two recently arrested
Panamanians and speculates that prosecutors intend to use them as
witnesses against him.
   Rubino on Nov. 8 got Hoeveler to order CNN to halt broadcasting
of any tapes that might interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired a tape for a day but stopped when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   Noriega is in a federal jail outside Miami awaiting on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

A federal judge Wednesday lifted the ban against the broadcast of tape
recordings of Manuel A. Noriega's jailhouse phone conversations, effectively
ending a three-week legal battle over the rights of the press versus the right
to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing seven tapes turned over by Cable News Network, U.S. District
Judge William M. Hoeveler determined that the only attorney-client conversation
on the tapes already had been broadcast by CNN, which had aired some of the
tapes before the judge ordered the network to stop.
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," Hoeveler said
during a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Frank Rubino, Noriega's chief defense counsel, said he had no objection to the
lifting of the ban. "The damage is done," he said. "A ban now is like shutting
the barn door after the horse escapes."
</P>
<P>
Rubino said he would pursue his motion to dismiss the case on the grounds of
government misconduct, along with a separate motion asking that the network be
found in contempt of court for airing more of Noriega's conversations after the
judge's Nov. 8 ban, and that CNN be fined $300,000 per broadcast.
</P>
<P>
CNN first broadcast two weeks ago portions of several tape recordings that were
made by officials of the federal prison south of here where Noriega has been
held on drug charges since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama 11
months ago.
</P>
<P>
One of those conversations was between Noriega and a Spanish-speaking secretary
for Rubino who served as a translator.
</P>
<P>
After the first broadcast, Rubino asked Hoeveler to issue a ban, and he did.
CNN appealed that temporary order, and on Nov. 18 the Supreme Court refused to
lift it.
</P>
<P>
Steven Korn, an attorney for CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting Systems
Inc., reiterated the network position that prior restraint is never
appropriate. "It's fizzled," he said of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the school's
Institute of Bill of Rights Law, told the Associated Press that it would have
been better had the issue returned to the high court for a final resolution.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Supreme Court let the ban stand "casts its shadow, and the
shadow is negative," he said. "Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these
sorts of strategies against news organizations. The battle isn't over yet."
</P>
<P>
CNN founder Ted Turner, who was attending the Western Cable Television
conference Wednesday in Anaheim, described the ruling as "a positive
development . . . . It doesn't really resolve the 1st Amendment issue
completely . . . (but) it's good for us."
</P>
<P>
CNN President Tom Johnson said the network can now pursue its story on the
government's taping of the ousted Panamanian leader's conversations.
</P>
<P>
"CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this judicial prior
restraint on press freedom," he said. "Despite the unfortunate delay, CNN's
reporting of government taping of Noriega phone conversations will continue."
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners' phone calls at
federal prisons. Noriega signed a release acknowledging that his calls were
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply to
conversations with his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease sharing Noriega's
tapes with other government agencies unless he approves.
</P>
<P>
The case against Noriega, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 28, is plagued
now by only one "collateral issue," in Hoeveler's words, and that is money.
Rubino says he has been unpaid for the last 11 months because about $27 million
stashed by Noriega in overseas bank accounts has been frozen at the request of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hoeveler ordered the government to try again to make some of that
money available.

   A federal judge broadened the constitutional issues
in the CNN-Manuel Noriega tapes case Monday, saying basic fairness
could allow him to block broadcast of the defendant's prison phone
conversations.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cited fairness again in
warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free
$20 million in frozen Noriega-linked bank accounts to pay defense
lawyers, or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the
money was drug-tainted.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to
be acquiring - that the defendant is not going to be able to get a
fair trial,'' Hoeveler said. ``There's an obvious need by all of us
in a case like this to show that our system, in fact, does work
from top to bottom.''
   On the tapes issue, the judge said transcripts of tapes handed
over by Cable News Network last week were expected to be completed
by late Monday, and will be discussed by all sides in a closed
hearing Wednesday morning.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Thursday on whether to maintain
his order preventing the network from broadcasting the tapes made
of calls the former Panamanian leader made from his prison cell
outside Miami.
   The judge emphasized he would review all CNN's tapes, not just
those between Noriega and his lawyers. He said an 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals opinion upholding his original gag order allowed
him to consider ``broader questions'' than attorney-client
privilege.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock protested, saying the issue should
not include matters such as pretrial publicity because the defense
had not asked for such a ruling.
   Outside the court, he said he was alarmed by the judge's
comments.
   ``It's bad enough that the court's engaging in this process of
pre-publication review,'' he said. ``But it's more disturbing that
the court is going broader than even the litigants are seeking.''
   Noriega's lawyers were pleased with the handling of the tapes,
however.
   ``How the devil can he ever receive a fair trial ... if CNN's
going to play his innermost, private discussions with his lawyers
planning his defense strategy,'' said Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead
attorney.
   In the second part of Monday's hearing, the judge said he would
postpone appointment of government-paid lawyers to replace Rubino's
defense team to give the government another chance to unfreeze
Noriega's foreign bank accounts.
   Prosecutors agreed in June to free the money, but later said
foreign governments had stepped in by filing their own confiscation
orders against the 27 accounts.
   Hoeveler said he would order a hearing on the frozen accounts
within 10 days to determine if the money was illegally earned.
   Noriega is facing up to 145 years in prison on a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect and facilitate their
U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami.

   A federal judge extended a ban against broadcast of
taped conversations between Manuel Noriega and his attorneys, but
Cable News Network defied the order Friday by playing another
recording.
   In the tape, Noriega discussed two potential government
witnesses with his defense team, and speculated on the prosecutors'
strategy.
   CNN President Tom Johnson defended the broadcast, calling the
judge's order ``unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys he
would hold the network in contempt of court if the tapes were
played, but did not act immediately.
   In an interview with a CNN producer broadcast later Friday,
Hoeveler said that whether or not he will find the network in
contempt ``remains to be seen.''
   Noriega's attorneys, meanwhile, accused the U.S. State
Department and the Panamanian government of President Guillermo
Endara of being the source of the tapes leaked to CNN.
   ``We believe the State Department had obtained copies of the
tapes, and gave them to the Endara government,'' said Noriega's
lead attorney Frank Rubino. ``A high-placed person in the Endara
government then provided them'' to CNN.
   A State Department spokesman said the agency was aware of
Rubino's comments, but had no immediate reaction.
   Noriega is charged in a February 1988 indictment with accepting
$4.6 million in bribes to turn Panama into a way station for the
Medellin cocaine cartel's U.S.-bound drug shipments. He has been
held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami since
shortly after he surrendered in the wake of the December 1989 U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   The tape played Friday by CNN was a conversation between Noriega
and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for the two men.
She tells him two more people have been arrested in Panama, and
says he should review their names to determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were an Alfredo
Sanchez and Felipe Camargo, a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in
Panama who had been the general's top liaison with the Cubans and
is believed to be cooperating with the U.S. government.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,''
Noriega says. ``It says they are trying to induce any of the two of
them to testify before the court against me.''
   Other tapes played Friday were conversations between Noriega and
allies, including a discussion with his mistress' mother about the
transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Earlier Friday, Hoeveler extended for 10 days his order banning
CNN from using any portion of the tape that could compromise the
former Panamanian dictator's attorney-client privilege.
   ``I cannot conceive that the law of prior restraint is so
sacrosanct and so encompassing'' it would allow broadcasting a
confidential attorney-client conversation no matter how damaging to
the defense, Hoeveler wrote in his order.
   The judge has also told CNN to turn over the tapes to a federal
magistrate, but suspended that requirement after the network
appealed the gag order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said he was preparing arguments to be
delivered in Atlanta Monday balancing the right of free speech
against the right to a fair trial.
   ``Right now we are on the cutting edge of the law in both the
First Amendment and the Sixth Amendment,'' May said Friday. ``This
could end up very quickly in front of the Supreme Court.''
   The U.S. Justice Department Friday was continuing its
investigation into whether the tapes were made by the Bureau of
Prisons and how they got into CNN's hands, said spokesman Doug
Tillett.
   The Justice Department said the Bureau of Prisons had the legal
right to tape such calls and does so routinely, but May said
Noriega's attorneys were assured their clients calls would not be
taped.
   ``If he asked the guard to call his lawyers, we had been led to
believe that those calls would not be recorded,'' May said. And he
noted that the prison knew when Noriega spoke to the attorneys,
because the guards, and not the prisoner, dialed the calls.
   Noriega's attorneys say they expect to ask for dismissal of the
charges against their client if they can prove misconduct in making
or handling of the tapes.
   The government of Panama, which in January had said its
shattered legal system could not properly try Noriega, says it is
now in a position to prosecute him if the U.S. case falls apart.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' Endara said.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias said Noriega has ``very serious
charges against him'' in Panama.
   The Panamanian government has charged Noriega and at least seven
of his officers with looting the treasury.

   The FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes
and was checking whether they are related to the Manuel Noriega
recordings at the center of a court battle. The network protested
the tapes were obtained without a warrant.
   Cable News Network said the tapes were in a box of materials
related to the Noriega case that was removed from a hotel room that
had been occupied by one of its reporters. The room was in the Omni
Hotel, which is part of a complex that houses CNN's offices.
   It was not immediately clear whether the tapes taken were audio
recordings or videotapes. CNN President Tom Johnson and CNN chief
counsel Steve Korn said they didn't know the contents of the box.
FBI spokesman Scott Nelson confirmed that authorities obtained CNN
tapes without a subpoena, but he didn't know what kind of tapes
they were.
   ``We were made aware of the tapes and merely picked them up for
analysis,'' Nelson said.
   The network demanded that the materials be returned.
   CNN is seeking to overturn a federal judge's order blocking it
from airing taped jailhouse conversations between the deposed
Panamanian dictator Noriega and his lawyers.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the complex, had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, the network said.
   The network said the FBI had no warrant and acted over the
objections of a CNN attorney who was present when the material was
taken by the agents. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a warrant
and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a warrant.''
   Johnson said he personally protested the FBI's action ``in the
strongest terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   The network said a Turner Security official called the FBI
because agents had told him they were looking for ``stolen
government property.'' The network said the material was not
stolen.
   Hotel security officers, believing that CNN reporter Marlene
Fernandez had vacated the hotel room, removed the box Monday and
turned it over to Turner Security, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
said.
   Turner Security returned the box to the hotel security office on
Thursday and then brought FBI agents to the office and gave them
the box, according to Haworth and hotel officials.
   The box contained some papers and at least one videotape, said
Omni General Manager Bill Thompson, who saw the box handed over to
the FBI.
   Johnson said ``it's in dispute'' whether the room was vacated by
Fernandez, who normally anchors CNN's Spanish-language telecasts in
Washington but had been working on the Noriega case.
   Haworth also said ``the people who needed to know did not know''
that Turner Security, another subsidiary of CNN's parent firm
Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., had the box of materials in its
possession.
   The New York Times, citing a CNN source who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the tapes taken were not the Noriega tapes.
``The FBI did not get the main course,'' he said.
   The tapes at the center of the court battle are recordings of
phone conversations between Noriega and his lawyers. On Nov. 8,
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami barred CNN from
broadcasting at least some portions of the seven tapes it has until
Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would endanger
Noriega's right to a fair trial by compromising privileged
attorney-client discussions.
   CNN has refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler. On Thursday,
the network asked a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Anthony M. Kennedy,
to let it broadcast the Noriega-lawyer tapes.
   Earlier this week, lawyers for CNN and Noriega struck an
agreement under which the network will not broadcast tapes of
Noriega talking to his lawyers until receiving some word from the
Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state they are
talking to their lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include
conversations between Noriega and his defense team.

   When CNN continued its coverage of recorded
telephone conversations of Manuel Noriega while appealing a federal
judge's order in the case Thursday, a former judge read the story.
   Catherine Crier, a former Texas District Court judge, was one of
several anchors telling viewers that CNN continued to broadcast its
first report on the jailed Panamanian dictator because U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling would amount to
unconstitutional prior restraint.
   Hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in Miami barring CNN from
broadcasting parts of recordings of Noriega's conversations with
his lawyers that could infringe on attorney-client privilege.
   CNN used excerpts from the jailhouse tapes Thursday morning,
repeated that during the day and said it planned to televise
another installment Thursday evening.
   The Atlanta-based cable news operation said it would appeal
Hoeveler's ruling.
   Ms. Crier, the youngest woman elected to Texas District Court,
was among the anchors explaining that CNN continued to repeat the
morning segment ``because it believes it has the right to do so
under the First Amendment.''
   CNN said Ms. Crier had nothing to do with the decision to
broadcast the story, and was reading the same commentary as other
anchors.
   CNN declined to allow her to be interviewed about the story's
judicial ramifications.
   Ms. Crier created a stir when she was hired at the 24-hour news
network in 1989 with no journalistic experience. She has said she
left the judgeship because courtroom competition ``may have
surpassed the notion of serving clients, of seeking justice.''

<HEAD>Judge Asks U.S. Attorney to Prepare Contempt Charges Against CNN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MIAMI (A) - A federal judge said today he has notified the U.S.
attorney's office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings
against CNN for broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped prison phone
calls.
   Legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a
judicial test of whether the government can practice prior
restraint on the news media.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable
News Network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not
violate Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   But he announced in a court hearing last week that he intended
to press contempt charges against the network if it were found to
have defied his initial order banning use of the tape.
   On Wednesday, he notified U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen to draw
up an order asking CNN to show cause why it should not be held in
contempt.
   The network will be allowed to respond in writing, Lehtinen's
spokeswoman Diane Cossin said today. A hearing will be set if
necessary.
   Because the order is against CNN and Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of fines,
not jail terms, Ms. Cossin added.
   Hoeveler said he decided to go forward with the criminal action
because the network defied his restraining order without waiting
first for the outcome of the legal process.
   In Atlanta, network spokesman Steve Haworth said: ``CNN is
confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue of
contempt, its actions will be vindicated.''
   The tape at issue involved a conversation between Noriega and an
investigator, with a defense attorney's secretary translating. The
network broadcast the tape for a day despite Hoeveler's order, but
withdrew it when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
backed the lower court judge. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
involve itself in the matter.

<HEAD>CNN Hands Over Noriega Prison Tapes to Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN attorneys on Tuesday handed a federal
magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of Manuel Noriega's
telephone calls, saying they were confident the recordings would
show his rights were never violated.
   The network acted in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's
weekend refusal to lift the trial judge's order that CNN cease
broadcasting the tapes, and surrender them to determine if their
use invaded Noriega's attorney-client right to confidentiality.
   ``We hope and are confident that the court will conclude that
the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances,''
said Steven Korn, chief counsel to CNN's parent company, Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. ``CNN believes ... that the conversations
that were telecast were not attorney-client privileged
conversations.''
   CNN surrendered the tapes to U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler in his chambers, but the judge said he did not want to
hear any potentially privileged conversations. He ordered them
given to U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff, who will make and study
transcripts and report his conclusions back to the Hoeveler, the
judge assigned to hear Noriega's drug-smuggling trial.
   No time limit was set, but Noriega's lead attorney Frank Rubino
said the judge guaranteed it would done ``with dispatch.'' It was
not known if the lawyers would be called in to consult with the
magistrate, or if a hearing would be held when his report was
issued, said Rubino.
   Korn refused to say how many tapes were handed over, or to
describe their contents or origins. He said the recordings
presented Tuesday were copies, not originals.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with privileged matters -
in part because Rubino tacitly agreed to broadcasting them when he
identified them on the air.
   But Rubino, who asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against
CNN, strongly disagreed, although he acknowledged he does not know
the contents of most of the tapes.
   ``There are numerous conversations with the general wherein ...
defense strategies were discussed, witnesses were discussed, and
things of that nature,'' Rubino said. ``We assume that to be what's
on the tape.''
   Hoeveler refused to set an immediate contempt hearing against
CNN. He said he must await a decision by Chief U.S. District Judge
James Lawence King on a motion by CNN asking that the trial judge
be removed from the tapes case.
   Rubino has subpoenaed CNN to produce a log of how many times the
network and its affiliates telecast a tape between Noriega and his
defense team.
   Noriega is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center. Prison officials routinely tape prisoners' phone
conversations for security reasons, unless the inmate indicates
beforehand that he is talking wiuth his attorney.
   The FBI is investigating how the tapes were leaked.
   Noriega co-counsel Jon May noted that the defense has asked for
contempt penalties of $300,000 per airing, and said one estimate of
damages was $12 million. That money should go to the cash-strapped
defense, he said.
   ``There is ample precedent for a court to direct a fine to one
of the parties,'' May said. ``And we are certainly, we believe, the
party most injured by CNN's actions, and ... would have the
greatest claim.''
   Hoeveler is considering whether to replace Rubino and May with
government-paid counsel. The judge had not announced a decision by
Tuesday.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator is jailed outside of Miami on
charges of taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial
isn't expected to begin before the spring.

Manuel A. Noriega and Cable News Network agreed Monday to postpone their
constitutional showdown over taped conversations until the U.S. Supreme Court
rules on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal worked out in federal court, CNN must refrain from playing any
tapes of talks between the imprisoned former Panamanian leader and his
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
In return, Noriega's defense delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to
$300,000 per broadcast against the network. U.S. District Judge William M.
Hoeveler also delayed his order demanding that CNN hand over seven disputed
tapes to the court.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is to keep Gen. Noriega from being denied a fair trial," defense
attorney Jon May said. "I'm not here to squeeze blood out of CNN."
</P>
<P>
He said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the Supreme Court to
focus on the broader constitutional question balancing protections of the
attorney-client privilege and freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorneys on Saturday had asked the judge to find CNN in contempt
after the network defied his court order and televised a contested tape.
</P>
<P>
CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the deal, but had the
right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they did not include conversations
with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based network is expected to file its appeal to the Supreme Court
later in the week, a CNN spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that CNN would not air, pending Supreme Court review, any
attorney-client conversations that it has in its possession," Bienstock said.
"We just want the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the Supreme
Court."
</P>
<P>
May said Monday's deal stops the clock on the contempt penalties, but does not
prevent the defense from later asking for fines against CNN.
</P>
<P>
Although attention has focused on the media, May said there are also other
potential parties to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole bunch of people in the U.S. who may have these tapes,
including the State Department and the CIA," he said. Lead Noriega attorney
Frank A. Rubino has said the tapes were leaked to CNN by a Panamanian official
who received them from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper in Panama City reported Monday that Panamanian Atty. Gen. Rogelio
Cruz will ask the United States for copies of the tape-recorded Noriega
telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
It said Cruz is convinced that the tapes would prove Noriega's involvement in
criminal activities inside Panama after the Dec. 20 U.S. military invasion.
</P>
<P>
Rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges against Noriega
based on government misconduct in recording the calls.
</P>
<P>
Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin
cocaine cartel.

Say</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court is condoning at least brief
``gag orders'' against the news media by refusing to let Cable News
Network broadcast tape-recorded conversations of Panama's Gen.
Manuel Noriega, say free press advocates.
   They said the justices' action Sunday was extraordinary and
poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings
nationwide.
   Attorney Floyd Abrams, who is representing CNN, said, ``The
court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   The high court's 7-2 rejection of CNN's emergency request ``does
seem to countenance brief prior restraints of a few days' duration
based on almost no showing of need at all,'' he said.
   The court's action Sunday effectively bars CNN from broadcasting
tape-recordings of conversations between Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine
what is on the tapes.
   The network said it will now turn over the tapes to Hoeveler's
court in Miami.
   Bruce Sanford, a lawyer who represents the Society of
Professional Journalists, said, ``The Supreme Court decision is a
grave disappointment that departs from existing Supreme Court
precedent. It is particularly troublesome because it seems
inconceivable that Noriega's counsel would ever be able to prove
that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the CNN
tapes.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for
Freedom of the Press, called the development a stunning departure
that ``signals a new era in First Amendment jurisprudence. It will
have a far-reaching impact in ... courts around the country.''
   However, Noriega defense attorney Jon May said, ``We think it's
a correct ruling. This was a major mistake by CNN, a big, big
mistake. This is a case of the messenger shooting itself. To
whatever extent the media may complain this is a significant
adverse decision, CNN has only itself to blame.''
   Only Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor sided
with CNN.
   Marshall, writing for both, said, ``I do not see how the prior
restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled'' with prior high
court rulings. He said Hoeveler's Nov. 8 order barring the CNN
broadcasts is based on the ``remarkable conclusion that publication
can be automatically restrained'' while courts study the basis for
such restraints.
   The seven justices who rejected CNN's application were silent,
leaving it unclear what they believe about the underlying
controversy.
   In the majority were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The high court order does not preclude the justices from some
day deciding that Hoeveler's order did violate CNN's free speech
rights protected by the First Amendment.
   The court could have refused to help CNN on some narrower
grounds and could review the issue at a later date if there is
still a live controversy.
   The Bush administration had joined with Noriega's lawyers in
opposing the CNN request.
   The Justice Department had said, ``The First Amendment is part
of the rule of law, not above it. A lasting prior restraint on
publication may be justified only in the most extraordinary
circumstances. But the rule of law requires permitting a court to
determine if those circumstances exist.''
   In addition to CNN's emergency request, the court also issued a
one-sentence order turning down a formal appeal filed by the cable
network.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   He said he hopes Hoeveler will permit CNN to air the tapes after
reviewing them.
   The federal government lost a much-publicized battle over a
prior restraint in 1971 when the Supreme Court allowed The New York
Times and The Washington Post to publish the so-called Pentagon
papers detailing American involvement in Vietnam.
   But some observers noted that for several days the high court
itself had, in effect, blocked publication while it was reviewing
the dispute.
   The prior restraint then was based on the government's claim
that publication would hurt national security.
   In a key 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a
Nebraska murder case. The court said then that such orders may be
used only as a last resort and that judges first must consider less
drastic measures.
   Noriega, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near MIami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape-record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their defense teams.
   But the CNN tape recordings reportedly contain some
conversations between the deposed Panamanian leader and his
lawyers.
   Noriega's lawyers said broadcasting the tapes would create
unfair pretrial publicity, would compromise the confidentiality of
the attorney-client relationship and tip off prosecutors about
defense strategy.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects CNN Bid To Broadcast Noriega Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has refused to give Cable
News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings of
conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN, meanwhile, is demanding the FBI return a box of recordings
and papers related to the case. The material was taken from an
Atlanta hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   The Supreme Court on Nov. 18 rejected an emergency request by
CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding
the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose.
The vote was 7-2.
   The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional
``prior restraint'' of free speech. But only two justices -
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor - agreed with that
assessment.
   Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The Justice Department had joined Noriega's lawyers in opposing
the request.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its
possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is ``confident that
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint.''
   Meanwhile, many questions remained about the network material in
the FBI's possession.
   CNN said the tapes and documents were taken by security officers
from an Omni Hotel room that had been used by reporter Marlene
Fernandez, who had been covering the Noriega story.
   Johnson said Fernandez had not checked out of the room, but the
hotel staff, apparently mistakenly, cleared out her room.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers, from whom the
FBI took the box.
   Johnson said it was still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, which contains both the hotel and the CNN offices, ``had a
discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen government property,
and Turner Security told them they had a box that might fit that
description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said. CNN denied the
material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified CNN official as saying
the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Union Employees of UPI Accept Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union employees of United Press International
on Nov. 16 accepted a proposed 35-percent pay cut for 90 days.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the Wire Service Guild, said
the pay cut was approved by 62 percent of those voting. The numbers
voting on each side were not released.
   Dahl spoke by telephone from the union's headquarters in New
York, where the ballots were counted.
   UPI vice president and spokesman Milt Capps said before the vote
that if employees accepted the pay cut, the company would be in a
financial condition to continue operating for 60 to 90 days while
it seeks a buyer.
   The financially troubled, 83-year-old news service already has
cut management salaries by the same percentage for 90 days.
   Capps had said if the pay cut were rejected, UPI might file for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws within days.
   Union officers had recommended rejection, saying the employees
could not afford the pay cut and it would not be enough to keep the
company afloat.
   Dahl said about 310 UPI employees are members of the guild. He
said the total work force covered by the union contract, counting
those who are not members, is close to 400.
   Capps said the company does not give out information on how many
bureaus or how many employees it has at home and abroad. UPI
announced in September that it was closing bureaus in New Mexico,
Wyoming, Montana, Michigan and North Dakota. It has since laid off
an unspecified number of employees.
   The top scale for a newsperson at UPI is approximately $690 a
week.
   The news service, founded in 1907 as United Press, became United
Press International when it merged with Hearst's International News
Service in 1958.
   In recent years, the company encountered financial difficulties
and changed hands three times.
   The original owner, the E.W. Scripps Co., sold it in 1982 to
Media News Corp. of Nashville, Tenn. It continued to lose money and
was sold in 1985 to Mario Vasquez-Rana, a wealthy Mexican newspaper
publisher.
   The present owner is Infotechnology Inc., parent firm to a
number of high-tech ventures.
   Infotechnology announced this month it has retained an
investment banking firm to negotiate the sale of its companies, and
hopes to sell them by the end of the year.

   Manuel Noriega got his day in court, accusing the
U.S. government of railroading him by freezing his assets and
forcing out his attorneys. A federal judge assured him he will get
a fair trial.
   Meanwhile, at a press conference in Atlanta, Cable News Network
on Friday denied a reporter's box full of tapes and other items on
the Noriega case was made available to the FBI.
   But CNN could not clearly explain a sister company's alleged
role in getting the box to federal agents Thursday.
   Speaking extensively to U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler for
the first time since he surrendered in January to U.S. invasion
troops, Noriega tried Friday to stop him from replacing private
defense attorneys with government-paid lawyers.
   ``I am now at the mercy of a totally unfair and unjust system
that chooses my prosecutors and now chooses my defense lawyers,''
the deposed Panamanian dictator said, reading quietly but
forcefully in Spanish from a prepared statement.
   Led by Frank Rubino, Noriega's lawyers say they can no longer
work unless the Panamanian's assets are unfrozen to pay them, or
the judge raises the $75-an-hour fee cap on court-appointment
lawyers.
   Hoeveler said he would rule in the near future, but reminded the
attorneys that raising the caps for the Noriega case was rejected
previously.
   He also said he received communications from ``some exceedingly
fine criminal defense lawyers'' willing to take the case under the
low government fee schedule.
   ``I want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift
by the court and by the judicial system,'' Hoeveler said.
   Earlier Friday, the private defense team filed a broad motion
asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client. It
argued that freezing Noriega's assets and taping his prison phone
calls was government misconduct.
   Hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion.
   In the CNN matter, the network claims the FBI contacted Turner
Security, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which also
operates CNN. The network says agents told Turner Security they
were searching for a box fitting the description of one hotel
security officers removed earlier in the week from the room of a
reporter assigned to the Noriega case.
   The FBI maintained that agents learned of the box from Turner
Security. Joe Shirley, head of Turner Security, did not return
repeated phone calls Friday.
   William Hinshaw, agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, said
Shirley called an agent investigating how CNN got the Noriega tapes
and told the agent that a box labeled ``Noriega tapes'' had been
removed from a hotel room. The agent, Hinshaw said, earlier had
contacted Turner Security about interviewing a CNN employee.
   ``I think when (Shirley) called he ... was just trying to
fulfill his responsibility,'' Hinshaw said.
   CNN general counsel Steven Korn insisted the FBI, not Turner
Security, made the first phone call about the box. When asked
whether CNN made the box available to the FBI, Korn replied:
``Emphatically, no.''
   Asked why Turner Security didn't give the box to CNN, Korn said,
``That's a good question.''
   CNN has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Hoeveler's
order, issued last week, barring it from broadcasting recordings of
prison telephone conversations between Noriega and his defense
team.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said Friday he didn't know if the
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes, or if
they contained phone calls between Noriega and his legal team.
   Noriega is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Ban on Broadcast of Noriega Tapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday lifted a ban on
broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's prison telephone calls,
defusing a confrontation between the rights of the media and those
of a criminal defendant.
   While CNN hailed the decision as a victory over censorship,
Noriega's defense and constitutional specialists said the case
showed the U.S. Supreme Court was willing to accept at least
temporary restrictions on the press.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's decision ended a
three-week legal battle between Noriega and the network, which
aired some of the tapes before the judge ordered CNN to stop.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the decision would allow the
network to pursue its story on the government's taping of the
ousted Panamanian leader's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said. ``Despite the
unfortunate delay, CNN's reporting of government taping of Noriega
phone conversations will continue.''
   The judge ruled after he and the attorneys reviewed transcripts
of seven tapes the network submitted to the court last week
following the Supreme Court's refusal to overturn Hoeveler's
initial ban.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Noiega defense attorney Frank Rubino
told the judge he would withdraw his request to stop the
broadcasts. He said the only tape that appeared to violate
lawyer-client privilege already had been broadcast.
   ``The problem today is that the tape's out, it's been published
to the world,'' Rubino said.
   ``It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is
out.''
   Federal prosecutors said they had no objections to lifting the
ban, once again insisting that Noriega's rights were never violated
by the routine prison taping.
   Rubino said outside the courtroom that the case has already left
its mark in the balancing of First Amendment protections for
freedom of speech and Sixth Amendment guarantees of a fair trial.
   ``The Supreme Court has upheld prior restraint and ordered CNN
to turn the tapes over to the court, and CNN complied with the
court,'' Rubino said. ``Prior restraint is in full force and
effect.''
   Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the
school's Institute of Bill of Rights Law, also said the case has
left a legacy, in part because the Supreme Court refused to halt
the ban.
   He said it would have been better had the issue returned to the
high court for a final resolution.
   ``It casts its shadow, and the shadow is negative,'' said
Smolla. ``Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these sorts of
strategies against news organization. The battle isn't over yet.''
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, said the ruling showed the gag order should never have been
issued in the first place, but she added she was worried about the
precedent set.
   ``The unfortunate effect of that is that a new organization has
been unconstitutionally constrained for several weeks from bringing
information lawfully obtained to the attention of the general
public,'' she said. ``That damage cannot be rectified.''
   CNN's legal problems haven't ended, Noriega's defense attorneys
contend. They want the judge to find CNN in contempt of court for
airing one of the tapes even after the judge's initial ban, and
fine the network $300,000 per violation. The judge has not said
whether he will schedule a contempt hearing.
   Such a hearing could reopen the issue of whether the prior
restraint was permissible, said William Greenhalgh a law professor
at Georgetown University.
   ``Now, it's much ado about nothing,'' he said. ``We've avoided
the constitutional issue - but if there is a contempt proceeding,
then we would really get into it.''
   The tape that touched off the dispute was between Noriega and
one of Rubino's investigators, with the lawyer's Spanish-speaking
secretary serving as an interpreter. In the conversation, Noriega
is asked about two recently arrested Panamanians, and speculates
that prosecutors intend to use them as witnesses against him.
   Rubino went into court Nov. 8 and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
broadcast any tapes that interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired the tape later that day, but withdrew it the
following day when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed
Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners'
phone calls at federal prisons, including the Metropolitan
Correctional Center, where Noriega is being held on drug-smuggling
charges. Noriega signed a release acknowledging his calls were
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply
to conversations with his attorneys.
   Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease
sharing Noriega's tapes with other government agencies unless he
approves.
   Following the hearing, the judge returned the tapes to CNN's
attorneys. The judge's clerk said the tape transcripts remained
sealed at the request of the network.
   Rubino has accused President Guillermo Endara's government in
Panama of giving the tapes to CNN after obtaining them from the
U.S. government, ridiculing an ongoing FBI probe of the leak.
   Gregory Craig, an attorney for Panama in that nation's $6.5
billion racketeering lawsuit against Noriega, submitted an
affidavit in that case Tuesday indicating he had received
``information'' from the tapes, including items never broadcast by
CNN.
   Craig strongly denied Wednesday that he had heard the actual
tapes, however, but refused to say whether his information came
from the Panamanian government.
   Noriega is charged with drug trafficking in a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
the Medellin drug cartel to protect cocaine shipments to the United
States.

   A judge today barred the Cable News Network from
televising recordings of telephone conversations between jailed
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and his attorneys. CNN called
the order unconstitutional and said network ``will continue our
coverage.''
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler said as details of the tapes came out in court.
   Following an emergency hearing this morning, the judge ordered
the network not to televise any tape that could infringe on
Noriega's attorney-client privilege.
   The emergency hearing, revolving around attorney-client issues
and First Amendment rights, was called after CNN used excerpts from
the jailhouse tapes this morning and said it planned to televise
another installment this evening.
   After issuing a temporary injunction, Hoeveler said he would
continue to study the issue and expected to have a final decision
by around 6 p.m., when the network was scheduled to have the second
installment.
   CNN President Tom Johnson issued a statement saying that an
appeal of the temporary injunction was being readied and adding:
``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts.''
   CNN attorney Daniel Waggoner said an ``any order, even one of a
few hours as the court has imposed here, that prevents any
publication or telecast, is an unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   Steve Haworth, CNN spokesman, said the network was continuing to
televise a segment that was first used this morning, which includes
segments of Noriega audio tapes that do not involve his attorneys.
Haworth declined to comment on whether any tapes involving
attorneys would be used later.
   Federal prison officials said inmates' phone conversations are
routinely monitored, except when they are talking to their lawyers.
But CNN said in its report this morning that it ``has a tape which
appears to be excepts of a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team. CNN has also been shown evidence that there are other
such recordings.''
   Conversations between a lawyer and client are deemed to be legal
secrets, except in extraordinary circumstances.
   Noriega has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
southwest of Miami since shortly after he surrendered to U.S.
troops in Panama following the invasion last December.
   He is awaiting trial on a February 1988 drug trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   Noriega attorney Frank Rubino told the judge that a CNN team
informed him Wednesday night they had obtained seven recordings
made by the Justice Department at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center.
   CNN televised excerpts today, offering a translation of a
Spanish conversation between Noriega and an unidentified man about
consolidating Noriega's power base in Panama, and a message to the
Cuban embassy in Panama.
   But CNN also played another tape for Rubino, who identified it
as Noriega's conversation with three defense team members.
   ``Can General Noriega receive a fair trial when every day we
wake up to the threat of our case strategy being aired to 400
million listeners, and the prosecution learning details of our
defense?'' Rubino asked.
   ``Without a doubt this is the most serious violation (of
attorney-client privilege) I have ever experienced in my years of
practice,'' Rubino told Hoeveler.
   The judge asked Waggoner whether he thought the network had the
right to ``shoot his (Noriega's) defense right in the head'' by
cablecasting the tapes.
   Gregory Bogdan, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in
Washington, said all telephone calls leaving federal prisons are
monitored.
   All prisoners sign a release form in both English and Spanish
notifying them of the procedure, and signs are posted over prison
phones reminding inmates that the calls are monitored, he said.
   ``But if they let us know they are calling their attorney, then
we don't monitor them,'' Bogdan said.
   Tapes are kept to prevent crimes from being planned behind bars
and are not normally released, he said.
   He said he did not know if CNN's tapes were official government
tapes, adding: ``Right now, the matter is under investigation -
where the tapes came from, where they were made.''
   Hoeveler said he would order the FBI to determine the source of
the tapes.
   Prosecutors told the judge they had not heard the tapes and
would be ``blindfolded'' during the investigation of how they were
released.

   CNN's tapes of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone
calls to his legal team are in the hands of a federal magistrate
who will help determine whether the former dictator's right to a
fair trial has been jeopardized.
   The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes on Tuesday
after the U.S. Supreme Court refused over the weekend to lift U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from
airing the recordings.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts
and report to Hoeveler, who as the judge who will preside over
Noriega's trial on drug trafficking charges will weigh a defense
request to dismiss the case.
   Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being
``tainted'' by having learned details of Noriega's defense
strategy.
   No time limit for reviewing the tapes was set, but Noriega's
lead attorney, Frank Rubino, said the judge guaranteed it would
done ``with dispatch.''
   Rubino also asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against CNN
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judge's
order. The judge did not immediately set a hearing, saying he must
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a
CNN request to remove him from the tapes case.
   CNN attorney Steven Korn wouldn't say how many tapes were turned
over. He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he
was confident that the judge will rescind his so-called prior
restraint on broadcast of the tapes.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by
attorney-client confidentiality - in part because Rubino tacitly
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.
   Noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because
of the taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged
government misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.

   Cable News Network, which never has been short on
ambition, is getting the global audience it wants by finding room
at the inns.
   While the Atlanta-based news channel now is seen in 84
countries, the best chance of catching CNN overseas is in a hotel
room. It still is rarity to see CNN in an average person's home
outside the United States.
   Transmitting CNN around the world was one of Ted Turner's goals
when his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. launched the 24-hour cable
network in 1980. The network has gradually increased its audience
potential and made its latest stride over the summer when it
arranged to use a Soviet satellite for transmissions in that corner
of the world.
   CNN is available in about 600 hotels _ more than 1 million rooms
_ worldwide. Other major international clients for CNN include
embassies, government offices, foreign news services and, to a
lesser extent, local cable television systems. CNN programming also
is shown on eight airlines, which excerpt segments to show
passengers on intercontinental flights.
   Network officials add that CNN is widely pirated and overall is
available to about 200 million people around the world.
   ``All of the populated areas of the world have the capability of
getting CNN,'' said Bob Ross, managing director of CNN
International Sales Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of TBS based in
London.
   ``With the exception of Antarctica and the western tip of
Australia ... the whole world gets it,'' Ross said.
   Though CNN is available domestically in 51.1 million U.S.
households, the target audience overseas is not the average TV
viewer, Ross said in a recent interview.
   Instead, CNN wants to be seen overseas by the wealthy and the
powerful _ heads of government, business leaders, Americans who are
traveling and other assorted VIPs, he said.
   ``What we're doing is making CNN the first global real-time news
medium, which will make CNN the network of record for major
decision-makers all over the world,'' Ross said. ``We will become a
primary news source for the world's decision-makers.''
   There are numerous obstacles to getting CNN to the world's
masses, Ross said. Most international transmissions are in English,
the necessary satellite reception equipment is too expensive for
many people, and in many places the government doesn't want its
people to have easy access to Western news reporting.
   ``We're not a mass entertainment network,'' Ross said. ``We
don't expect to be watched by a welder who is only fluent in his
native language.''
   It's easy to imagine, though, that Turner, a globe-trotting
champion of peace among nations, would want ultimately to make his
programming available to the widest audience possible.
   ``I think that's Ted's goal, to get CNN to everyone,'' said Russ
Barry, the Los Angeles-based president of Turner Program Services,
TBS' syndication arm.
   Barry said TBS is getting inquiries from areas that receive CNN
which also are interested in receiving other Turner programming,
such as the shows on the TBS ``SuperStation'' and Turner Network
Television's all-day schedule of vintage movies.
   ``The international market is quite active,'' he said.
   CNN's first international markets were in Canada and Australia
in 1983. The network broke into Europe in 1985, Japan the following
year, South America in 1988 and Asia and Africa this year, Ross
said.
   The version of CNN seen overseas has some modifications from the
U.S. presentation _ for example, in many places it is not available
24 hours a day _ but Ross said it is fundamentally the same.
   ``It is an American news product and it does reflect an American
perception of events _ as objectively as we can, but some intrinsic
perception is American,'' he said.
   Ralph Wenge, who anchors CNN's daily ``International Hour'' and
weekend ``World Report'' from Atlanta, said the network's global
view reflects a growing public awareness of how events thousands of
miles apart are interrelated.
   He said the international elements of CNN's programming also
have contributed to the network's increased respect here and abroad.
   The network's increased presence cuts both ways, however, Wenge
said. While most of the response to CNN's international work is
positive, some people overseas resent the strong presence of a U.S.
news operation.
   ``The other side is, `Why should a broadcast network originating
in the United States come into our countries and tell us what's
happening in our country?''' Wenge said. ``They'd like their own
CNN.''

   Cable News Network is demanding the FBI return a
box of recordings and papers related to the government's taping of
Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls. The material was taken from
a hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   Both an FBI official and CNN President Tom Johnson said today
they didn't know if the recordings were audio tapes or videotapes,
or if they were the phone calls between Noriega and his lawyers
that are at the center of a legal battle before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We just know that there were notes, work papers and tapes''
related to CNN's coverage of the Noriega story, Johnson said. ``But
in the process of working in an operation like this, you could have
all sorts of tapes, including (taped) air checks.''
   The box of material was given to the FBI on Thursday by security
guards at the hotel. CNN claimed the box was improperly removed
from the room of reporter Marlene Fernandez and that the FBI
obtained it without a warrant.
   CNN reported today that an FBI agent showed up at the CNN
Washington bureau looking for Fernandez and a producer, Kathy
Slobogan. Neither was present.
   Bureau officials told the agent that CNN would cooperate with
the FBI, but would not allow ``fishing expeditions'' through CNN
offices, the network said on a midday newscast.
   William Hinshaw, head of the FBI bureau in Atlanta, said today
that after a Thursday night meeting with CNN officials, he agreed
to seal the box and not take inventory of its contents until the
Justice Department orders him to do so.
   The FBI previously said agents would go through the box today.
   Hinshaw said he didn't know what materials were in the box. He
said he did see some cassettes in the box, but was uncertain if
they were audio or video cassettes, although he said ``one I saw
appeared to be a (audio) cassette.''
   The network has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
federal judge's order, issued last week, barring it from airing
recordings of conversations between Noriega and the fallen
Panamanian dictator's legal team.
   In addition, a hearing was scheduled in Miami this afternoon to
determine whether Noriega, whose assets have been frozen by
prosecutors, should be declared indigent and appointed a government
defense attorney.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino, saying it might be one of
his last acts in the Noriega case, today filed a motion to dismiss
the charges against Noriega, accusing the government of engaging in
a conspiracy to deny ``his right to a fair trial and the effective
assistance of counsel.''
   The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping
Noriega's prison phone calls with his lawyers as well as illegally
freezing his funds. It also says an unidentified government witness
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a
bribe to change his testiony.
   Noriega is being held in a Miami jail, awaiting trial on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade. The
FBI is investigating how CNN obtained seven tapes of his jail cell
phone conversations.
   FBI spokesman Scott Nelson in Washington said Thursday that
agents obtained the box without a warrant. ``We were made aware of
the tapes and merely picked them up for analysis,'' he said.
   Johnson said he protested the FBI's action ``in the strongest
terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   CNN general counsel Steve Korn said today he'd written Joseph
Whitley, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, ``demanding the return of
the tapes and that the materials in the box not be reviewed or
duplicated.''
   The New York Times today quoted an unidentified CNN official as
saying the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.
   The box was removed Monday from a room that had been occupied by
Fernandez, who has been working on the Noriega story.
   Her room was at the Omni Hotel, which is owned by CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting, and is part of a complex that also
houses CNN's offices.
   Hotel manager Bill Thompson said hotel security officers thought
Fernandez had checked out when they removed a box containing papers
and at least one videotape.
   CNN's Johnson said today that Fernandez, who has been covering
the Noriega story, ``had not checked out of the room. But
apparently there was a mistake'' by the hotel that led to her room
being cleared out.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers from whom the
FBI took the box, he said.
   He and Korn said it still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   ``I don't know who called who,'' Korn said.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, ``had a discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen
government property and Turner Security told them they had a box
that might fit that description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
Thursday. CNN denied the material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   CNN said agents took the box over the objections of a network
attorney who was present. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a
warrant and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a
warrant.''
   Meanwhile, CNN lawyers on Thursday asked Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy to set aside a judge's order barring broadcast of
the phone conversations.
   Kennedy, who handles such emergency matters from Florida,
referred the case to the full court. There was no word on when it
might act.
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars it from broadcasting
the tapes until Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would
violate Noriega's rights.
   CNN refused to give up the tapes but agreed not to air any
attorney-client recordings until the Supreme Court decides the
matter. The network contends Hoeveler's order is an
unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' phone calls routinely are
monitored, except when prisoners say they are talking to their
lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include conversations
between Noriega and his defense team.

A federal judge Thursday released a 72-page transcript of telephone
conversations of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, tape recorded in his jail cell talking
to his wife, his daughters, his mistress and his mistress's mother. The talk is
riddled with cryptic references to the weather, food deliveries, private
messages and even Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
In most of the fragmented conversations, the former Panamanian dictator does
little but listen and say yes. But in one phone call he seems to discuss
government policies in his homeland and expresses concern for former allies now
jailed. In another he complains that he jammed his fingers playing basketball.
"Damn it," he says, "my hand swelled up."
</P>
<P>
Release of the court transcripts followed a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District
Judge William M. Hoeveler that the tapes, obtained in Panama last month by the
Cable News Network, did not contain any conversations that might impede
Noriega's right to a fair trial. Only one attorney-client conversation is
included on the tapes, and that was broadcast by CNN Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
These conversations have already been before the U.S. Supreme Court in what was
billed as a constitutional battle over freedom of the press and a criminal
defendant's right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The transcripts were entered into the court record Thursday when CNN decided
not to appeal Hoeveler's ruling, which followed a motion by four news
organizations arguing for their release.
</P>
<P>
As CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said earlier this week, many of the
conversations between Noriega and family members and friends seemed to be in
code. In one conversation with a woman identified as Norma, the mother of
Noriega's mistress, Vicki Amado, she addresses the general as "little soldier,"
and then goes on to tell him that "at any given moment there we have . . . a
good towel."
</P>
<P>
"Ah, perfect," responds Noriega.
</P>
<P>
"And the important thing," adds Norma, "is that it shouldn't be a hand towel."
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Noriega agrees.
</P>
<P>
CNN has refused to say how it obtained the tape recordings, which were made at
the federal prison south of here, where Noriega has been held on drug charges
since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama a year ago this month.
Frank A. Rubino, Noriega's chief attorney, said that CNN got the tapes from an
official of the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
Held in a two-room cell, Noriega has full-time access to a telephone but knows
his calls are monitored and recorded. The English-language transcripts,
compiled by a Spanish-speaking court interpreter, reveal little of Noriega's
moods or thoughts. But they are filled with apparently guarded references to
those who might aid his defense against charges that he received millions of
dollars in payments from smugglers shipping cocaine into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a co-defendant of Noriega's, former Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid,
formally agreed Thursday in U.S. District Court to testify against his former
chief.
</P>
<P>
Del Cid, once the commander of the Panamanian Defense Force in western Panama,
pleaded guilty to illegally transporting U.S. funds.
</P>
<P>
Under a plea-bargain agreement, other charges resulting from his alleged
involvement in racketeering and money-laundering with Noriega were dropped.
Prosecutors say that Del Cid, who surrendered to U.S. forces during last
December's invasion of Panama, acted as Noriega's emissary to the drug cartel.

   Some satellite dish owners in Central and South
America no longer will get Cable News Network for free.
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner, said Thursday it
plans to begin scrambling its CNN feed south of the border.
   The company said it will make the switch next month when it
begins beaming the Turner Network Television movie channel to the
region on a scrambled signal. TBS said the dish owners were
receiving the service illegally for two years.
   TBS feeds its 24-hour news channel into about 35,000 hotel rooms
and 250,000 homes in the region and sells its signal to about 35
broadcast clients, TV stations and networks.
   South American satellite dish owners who want to continue
receiving CNN would have to buy a receiver and decoder from an
equipment company, at a cost of about $1,300, and then enter a
contract with CNN to unscramble the feed.
   Although CNN does not now contract with individuals, spokeswoman
Kitsy Riggall said the company would ``certainly work with anybody
who wants to receive it.''
   TBS, which has been scrambling its signal in the United States
for five years, said it was concerned about ``weak copyright laws
in the region.''
   The company said it has no plans to scramble CNN's signal to the
rest of the world.

Cable News Network today handed over to a federal judge tapes of Manuel Noriega
talking on the telephone from his prison cell.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate William C. Turnoff.
</P>
<P>
CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order barring the
network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were broadcast before an
appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the order.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal magistrate so
that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's drug-trafficking trial, is not
"tainted" by any disclosures about Noriega's defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorneys claim that the tapes disclose defense maneuvers and have
damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and translated from Spanish,
then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler said he did not know how long that
would take.
</P>
<P>
The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage Noriega's right
to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a permanent ban on further
broadcasts, CNN can again appeal, eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.

   The Supreme Court refused by a 7-2 vote Sunday
to give Cable News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings
of conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his
lawyers.
   The court rejected an emergency request by CNN that was aimed at
lifting a federal judge's order forbidding the broadcasts until he
could determine what the tapes disclose.
   The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional
``prior restraint'' of free speech. But only two justices -
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor - agreed with that
assessment.
   Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The Justice Department had joined with Noriega's lawyers in
opposing the request.
   In addition to the emergency request, the court also turned down
a formal appeal filed by the cable network, in a one-sentence
order.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its
possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is ``confident that
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint.''
   ``CNN is committed to establishing its full freedom to telecast
newsworthy information to the American people and it will pursue
this case vigorously in order to do so,'' Johnson said.
   Floyd Abrams, CNN's attorney in the case, said the court's
decison ``has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   ``The refusal of the court to hear the case does seem to
countenance brief prior restraints of a few days duration based on
almost no showing of need at all by the courts,'' Abrams said.
   Noriega's defense attorney, Jon May, said CNN had opened a
``Pandora's box'' with its First Amendment challenge.
   ``We think its a correct ruling,'' May said. ``This is a case of
the messenger shooting itself. To whatever extent the media may
complain this is a significant adverse decision, CNN has only
itself to blame.''
   In a dissenting opinion for himself and O'Connor, Marshall said
``this case is of extraordinary consequence for freedom of the
press.''
   ``Our precedents make unmistakably clear that any prior
restraint of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy
presumption against its constitutional validity and that the
proponent of this drastic remedy carries a heavy burden of showing
justification for its imposition,'' Marshall said.
   ``I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can
be reconciled with these teachings,'' Marshall said. ``Even more
fundamentally, if the lower courts in this case are correct in
their remarkable conclusion that publication can be automatically
restrained pending application of the demanding test established by
(a 1976 decision that severely limited the power of judges to
impose such restraints) then I think it is imperative that we
re-examine the premises and operation of (that decision).''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director Reporter's Committee for
Freedom of the Press, said she was ``stunned'' by the decision,
which she called ``truly unprecedented.''
   ``The fact that the court would be willing to tolerate a prior
restraint in these circumstances signals a new era in First
Amendment jurisprudence,'' Kirtley said. ``It will have a
far-reaching impact going beyond this case extending to many cases
in state and federal courts around the country.
   Bruce Sanford, an attorney for the Society of Professional
Journalists, said the court's decision is ``troublesome because it
seems inconceivable that Noriega's counsel would ever be able to
prove that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the
CNN tapes.''
   Walt Wurfel, a spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcasters, said his group was ``very disappointed'' with the
court's decision. ``We view the lower court's order as prior
restraint,'' he said.
   The Bush administration Saturday had urged the high court to
leave intact Hoeveler's order. Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the
government's top-ranking courtroom lawyer, argued in written briefs
that the restraining order was justified to give the judge time to
determine whether seven tapes in CNN's possession might interfere
with Noriega's ability to receive a fair trial.
   Noriega, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between an inmates and their defense teams. But the CNN tape
recordings reportedly contain some conversations between the
deposed Panamanian leader and his defense lawyers.
   Sunday's high court order, issued without any explanatory
opinion, does not necessarily preclude the possibility that some
day the court will rule that Hoeveler's order did violate CNN's
free-speech rights.
   The court conceivably could have refused to help CNN because of
some procedural reason. The cable network might carry its legal
battle back to the court at some later date.
   But meanwhile, CNN is under court order not to broadcast those
portions of its tapes divulging Noriega's conversations with his
lawyers. If those conversations are broadcast, CNN could be cited
with contempt of court and fined heavily.
   The federal government lost a much-publicized battle over a
prior restraint in 1971 when the Supreme Court allowed The New York
Times and The Washington Post to publish the so-called Pentagon
papers detailing American involvement in Vietnam.
   In a key 1976 decision stemming from pretrial publicity in a
Nebraska murder case, the court ruled that forbidding the news
media from publishing or broadcasting information in its possession
almost never can be justified.
   The court in that decision called such prior restraints -
sometimes referred to as ``gag orders'' - the ``least tolerable''
measures of assuring fair trials.
   In seeking the prior restraint against CNN, Noriega's lawyers
argued that broadcasting the tapes would poison their client's
fair-trial rights in two ways: through pretrial publicity and by
compromising his relationship with his lawyers.

The government's problem-plagued case against deposed dictator Manuel A.
Noriega appeared Tuesday to be headed for a lengthy delay because of a shortage
of funds to pay his defense attorneys and a judge's determination to find out
who leaked taped conversations of the former Panamanian leader.
</P>
<P>
At a court hearing, Justice Department officials told U.S. District Judge
William M. Hoeveler that they have been unable to carry out the order he issued
last June to unfreeze Noriega's overseas bank accounts to provide $4 million to
$6 million for his legal fees.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler replied that he might have to choose court-appointed defense attorneys
willing to work at much lower government wages, a development that he said
would postpone the scheduled Jan. 28 start of Noriega's drug-trafficking and
money-laundering trial.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the judge said that he might name a special prosecutor to
investigate how Cable News Network last week obtained government tapes of
Noriega's jailhouse phone calls to his lawyers and former associates.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed a plea from Sam Burstyn, an attorney for co-defendant
Luis A. del Cid, that the judge name a special prosecutor with subpoena power
to determine why prison officials recorded attorney-client phone calls of
Noriega and perhaps other defendants. He said that the inquiry should determine
who had access to the recordings and who gave them to CNN.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler ordered the network last week to stop broadcasting the recordings, but
CNN initially refused to comply. After the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld Hoeveler's injunction, CNN said that it would appeal the matter to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the network agreed to stop the broadcasts when Hoeveler said
he would postpone any sanctions against CNN until the Supreme Court issues a
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler promised to consider Burstyn's suggestion but said that he first
wanted to give the FBI a chance to pursue an inquiry it launched last week into
the tapes. If the FBI needs subpoena power, "they know where to come to get it,
and I'll be happy to comply," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Noriega's legal fees, a top Justice Department official said
that government lawyers have tried repeatedly to get Switzerland, France and
Austria to reverse "freeze orders" imposed on Noriega's bank accounts at the
department's request last winter.
</P>
<P>
Drew C. Arena, director of the Justice Department's Office of International
Affairs, said the department had sought the orders on grounds that more than
$20 million held overseas by the Panamanian leader represented the illicit
proceeds of narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hoeveler's insistence, the department started to reverse the process.
"But it's a little like trying to unring a bell," Arena told the court.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign officials have maintained the freeze on grounds their own
domestic laws provide for forfeiture of any drug money, unless U.S. officials
certify that Noriega's funds are free of any such taint. "We, of course, cannot
do that," Arena said.
</P>
<P>
Frank A. Rubino, Noriega's chief defense lawyer, said he suspects but cannot
prove that U.S. officials secretly had encouraged foreign nations to impose
their own freeze to foul up the defense effort.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said that he would act by Friday to appoint government-paid defense
lawyers if the problem remains unresolved. Rubino said he could not afford to
work for government legal fees of approximately $60 an hour. His own rates are
$350 an hour, he said.

<HEAD>CNN To Appeal Noriega Tapes Order to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
ban on broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone
conversations with his legal team.
   Constitutional law experts said it could become a landmark case.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said Nov. 11 that the appeal was
being prepared, but he didn't know when it would be filed.
   CNN had defied an order Nov. 9 by U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler of Miami by broadcasting an excerpt in which the deposed
Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish with a secretary for defense
lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Nov. 10, Haworth said. Later that day, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and
fine the network $300,000 for each time it televised the tapes and
each time it showed them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior-restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., called the CNN case ``an
astonishing illustration of censorship,'' but said the network was
``playing with blasting caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said U.S. officials wanted
to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   CNN's broadcast marked the first time the tapes themselves had
been made public, but not the first time their contents were
reported.
   New York Newsday published a story last month based on summaries
of the tapes in which unidentified federal sources said it appeared
the former Panamanian leader was attempting to organize resistance
to the U.S.-supported government of President Guillermo Endara,
which replaced his regime.

<HEAD>Newspapers Ask Appeals Court To Publish Restraint Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rock Hill Herald and The Charlotte
(N.C.) Observer want an appeals court to publish its opinion
overruling a federal judge's prior-restraint order so it can serve
as a legal precedent.
   ``The opinion in this case, if published, will provide
substantial guidance to lower courts in this circuit, in the event
they are requested, or otherwise inclined, to prohibit the news
media from publishing information properly obtained during open
court proceedings,'' papers filed by the newspapers' lawyers said.
   If the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does publish its
opinion, it would mean the case could be cited as a precedent in
future prior-restraint cases, said David Robinson II, a lawyer for
The Herald.
   ``There's nothing published of recent vintage that deals with
open court statements and prior restraint,'' Robinson said Nov. 9.
``We think this would be helpful in the future.''
   Unpublished opinions made by the appeals court cannot be cited
in legal proceedings, Robinson said.
   The case began Oct. 31 when U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Simons Jr. inadvertently said in open court in Columbia, S.C., that
Rock Hill attorney Mitchell K. Byrd was a ``target'' of a drug
investigation.
   When Simons was told that reporters from The Herald and the
Observer were in the courtroom, he ordered them not to print his
remark.
   Both newspapers appealed the order and neither printed the name
the following morning.
   The Herald printed the judge's statement about Byrd on Nov. 2
and was later called to court to defend that action.
   On Nov. 6, the appeals court declared the judge's original order
invalid, and Simons dropped his case against The Herald and
canceled the ordered court appearance.
   John Buchan, a lawyer for the Observer, said federal trial
judges are bound by precedents in their circuits and therefore
would be required to follow this order, if published.
   ``Having such a precedent will resolve such issues before they
reach the appellate court, because the laws will be very clear,''
Buchan said.

<HEAD>Judge Bars CNN From Broadcasting Noriega-Lawyer Conversations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge barred the Cable News Network from
broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped conversations with his lawyers,
saying the ousted Panama dictator's right to a fair trial on drug
charges is in jeopardy.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino said he would demand that the case
against Noriega be dismissed.
   ``We are absolutely shocked and horrified that the United States
government would wiretap General Noriega and his lawyers engaging
in the most sensitive of communications,'' Rubino said.
   But Justice Department officials said the taping was routine,
and that Noriega had known his calls would be monitored. A federal
prison spokesman said it was up to Noriega to inform officials that
he was talking with his attorneys so they would stop the recording.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Thursday told CNN it
couldn't broadcast the tapes, made by prison officials, and
demanded an investigation into how the network got them. He also
ordered the taping stopped.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, in Tampa on Thursday, said
U.S. officials want to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   CNN accused the judge of exercising unconstitutional prior
restraint and demanded an immediate hearing on the issue from the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. No hearing was
immediately scheduled by the appeals court, but Hoeveler scheduled
another hearing in his court for late this afternoon.
   Meantime, he told the news station not to broadcast, at least
through today, any tapes that would interfere with attorney-client
privilege rights.
   ``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts,'' said CNN President Tom Johnson.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   U.S. Justice Department officials said the taping was routine
and produced a document in English and Spanish that Noriega signed
acknowledging that his phone conversations would be monitored.
   Rubino complained that the taping of Noriega's conversations
violated his client's right to private meetings with his attorneys
and jeopardized his case because the U.S. government now knows his
defense strategy.
   U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Gregory L. Bogdan in Washington
said prisoners are supposed to inform guards when they are talking
to their attorneys so the monitoring can be stopped.
   Federal prosecutors told Hoeveler they haven't heard the tapes.
Rubino was skeptical.
   ``And I believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth
Fairy,'' he said.
   The taping flap is the latest threatening to delay or derail
Noriega's trial on charges he accepted $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   The U.S. government has earmarked $6 million of $20 million in
frozen Noriega assets for payment of his attorneys, but last month
Panama filed a lawsuit accusing Noriega of looting its treasury and
said it would seek to have those assets frozen. Noriega's defense
teams says it needs the money to put together his defense before
the case can go to trial.
   The trial is scheduled to begin early next year, but both sides
agree it will probably be delayed.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara said Thursday that if the
United States does not go through with the trial, Panama wants
Noriega returned to face charges there.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court's Ruling Against CNN Creates Loophole For GAg Orders Against
Press</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court's handling of the
CNN-Noriega free-press dispute creates a loophole for short-lived
``gag orders'' against the news media.
   Although the court 14 years ago told judges they almost never
may bar the reporting of information already in news media hands,
Sunday's 7-2 vote left intact such a restraint against Cable News
Network.
   The high court's action, however, was not unprecedented and may
not have set any lasting rule of law.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift an order by U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler in Miami forbidding the broadcast of
conversations between Manuel Noriega, the imprisoned former
dictator of Panama, and his lawyers.
   FEderal prison authorities monitor and tape record all inmates'
telephone conversations except when told that inmates are talking
to their lawyers. But CNN reportedly has seven tapes containing
some conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
   When Noriega's lawyers rushed into court to prevent the tapes
from being broadcast, the judge ordered CNN to let him hear the
tapes so he could determine whether fair-trial rights would be
jeopardized. And the judge ruled that CNN could not broadcast the
tapes until his determination was made.
   The cable network, citing a series of Supreme Court decisions,
carried its fight to Washington rather than surrender the tapes.
Now, CNN will submit the tapes to Hoeveler and await his decision
on whether they may be broadcast.
   The ordered delay is itself a prior restraint on reporting -
something the Supreme Court in 1976 called ``the most serious and
least tolerable infringement'' of free-press rights.
   In a key 1976 ruling, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order barring the news media from publishing a Nebraska murder
defendant's confession after it was revealed in a public court
hearing.
   Two of the seven justices who voted against CNN Sunday said in
1976 they seriously doubted whether such prior restraints ever
could be valid.
   Writing for himself in the Nebraska case, Justice Byron R. White
said, ``There is grave doubt in my mind whether orders with respect
to the press such as were entered in this case would ever be
justified.''
   In the same case, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote he might rule
the press never can bE barred from reporting information it has
``no matter how shabby or illegal the means by which the
information is obtained, how serious an intrusion on privacy might
be involved, how demonstrably false the information might be, how
prejudicial it might be ... and how perverse the motivation for
publishing it.''
   Those views could indicate Sunday's vote centered on some issue
narrower than the constitutionality of Hoeveler's gag order.
   If the judge, after listening to the tapes, decides to continue
his ban, CNN could return to the high court. The justices would not
be precluded from ruling at that time that CNN's free-press rights
were violated.
   To some, such a scenario might seem contradictory. But similar
action was taken before the 1976 ruling - Justice HArry A. Blackmun
rejected an emergency request to lift the Nebraska judge's
restraining order pending the full court's decision.
   In 1971, the court ruled the government could not bar The New
York Times and The Washington Post from publishing stories based on
the so-called Pentagon papers detailing U.S. involvement in
Vietnam. But for five days the newspapers were barred by a high
court order from publishing such stories pending its decision.
   And in 1979 the justices rejected an emergency request by The
Progressive magazine, which was then under an order blocking
publication of an article the government said would help other
nations develop a hydrogen bomb.
   The high court refused to order a federal appeals court to speed
up its review of a restraining order issued by a trial judge. The
ban on publishing was in effect for more than seven months.
   Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment expert representing CNN, said
Sunday's action ``left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   But if such tactics are allowed by lower courts, Abrams said,
the Supreme Court might intervene.
   If CNN is not allowed to broadcast its tapes, such Supreme Court
intervention may not be far off.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Draws Up Contempt Charges Against CNN in Noriega
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors worked on criminal contempt charges
Thursday against CNN for allegedly violating a judge's order
prohibiting the network from airing tapes of Manuel Noriega's
prison telephone calls.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler announced his intention
last week to press contempt charges against the network because it
apparently defied his initial order banning use of the audio tapes.
   Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the
tapes, ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial
on charges of providing safe passage for Colombia drug traffickers
through Panama.
   The contempt charges were expected to be ready in a few days,
said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   Because the order is against CNN and parent Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of
fines - not jail terms, Ms. Cossin said.
   ``CNN is confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue
of contempt, its actions will be vindicated,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said.

A federal judge today lifted his ban against Cable News Network's broadcast of
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls to his legal team.
</P>
<P>
The ban on CNN's use of the tape had sparked a fierce constitutional debate,
pitting the right of free speech against the right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler said at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorney, Frank Rubino, said he no longer had any objection to CNN's
use of the tapes. The only tape he challenged was a conversation between
Noriega and his defense team that had already been broadcast by CNN.
</P>
<P>
"It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop its practice of
sharing tape-recorded conversations in the Noriega case with other government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler last month temporarily barred CNN from using parts of taped
conversations between Noriega and his attorneys, who said airing the tapes
would destroy the ousted Panamanian dictator's defense against drug charges.
</P>
<P>
CNN broadcast some tapes, including a conversation between Noriega and Rubino's
secretary, who acted as a translator for Rubino's investigator.
</P>
<P>
An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the order, and CNN
last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to Hoeveler for review.

<HEAD>U.S. Delegation in Europe to Free Noriega Accounts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. government delegation is in Europe seeking
to unfreeze Manuel Noriega's bank accounts for use in his legal
defense, a federal prosecutor said today.
   The delegation consists of State Department and Justice
Department officials who are visiting Austria and Switzerland, but
most details of their visit are secret, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Sullivan.
   About $20 million is sitting in 27 Noriega-linked accounts, and
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler has ordered $6 million of
those funds paid into a trust account to cover attorneys fees and
expenses for the deposed Panamanian dictator, who says he has no
other funds.
   The delegation's visit is ``to discuss the possibility of
unfreezing the accounts that are being designated as the
general's,'' Sullivan said. ``the discussions are ongoing.''
   Until the funds are freed, the judge asked Noriega's defense
counsel to take a temporary appointment as government-paid
attorneys, but they id not immediately respond. Lead attorney
Frank Rubino has previously rejected that arrangement because fees
are limited to a maximum of $75 an hour, far less than the $350 an
hour he says is appropriate in a complex drug-trafficking case.
   The U.S. delegation was sent to Europe after Hoeveler said he
would hold a formal hearing to make prosecutors justify freezing
the assets. That would force them to reveal much of their case in
advance, the defense has said.
   The funds were originally frozen at U.S. request following the
December 1989 invasion of Panama and the subsequent capture of
Noriega.
   But in June, the judge ordered the money unfrozen for Noriega's
defense. Last month, however, federal prosecutors told the judge
that foreign governments had initiated their own forfeiture
proceedings, tying up the money.
   Also at today's hearing, the judge said he would set a new trial
date for Noriega, although some of his co-defendants could be tried
on Jan. 28 as planned. Rubino said the defense could not be ready
before June at the earliest, and Hoeveler said he would take that
under advisement.
   The judge also said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against
CNN to determine if the network violated a court order by
telecasting a taped prison telephone call between Noriega and his
defense team. While transcripts from the tapes eventually were made
public, CNN's decision last month to telecast parts of them despite
a court order is still at issue.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said the network had informed him it
will present a full defense against the contempt citation, a
defense which legal experts have said could once again test the
balance between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial.
   Noriega is confined in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami facing charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombian drug traffickers.

   Contempt fines levied against CNN should be used to
pay for Manuel Noriega's defense against drug smuggling charges, an
attorney for the deposed Panamanian dictator said Monday.
   On Sunday, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact a federal judge's
temporary order that barred CNN from airing tapes of jailhouse
phone conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
contempt of court hearing against CNN in view of the U.S. Supreme
Court's 7-2 decision.
   The defense has asked for fines of $300,000 per airing of the
conversations, and May said it will ask that money be used for a
Noriega defense trust fund.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that GEneral Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said.
   That could allow NOriega to keep his private defense team even
though his funds have been frozen by federal prosecutors and
foreign governments.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said last week he would
decide soon whether to replace Noriega's private attorneys with
government-paid counsel. The private attorneys have said they
cannot stay on the case without some money.
   STeven Korn, chief counsel for CNN's parent company Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., said the network had no position on how
any fines it might pay should be dispersed because it doesn't
Expect to pay any.
   He said the network never aired privileged conversations under
Hoeveler's order.
   ``I think that point has been lost in the hue and cry,'' Korn
said. He noted that lead Noriega attorney Frank Rubino had
identified and described the conversation on the air, and even
pushed the button on the tape recorder.
   Hoeveler, meanwhile, has set a hearing for Tuesday on how to
proceed with the prison tapes at the center of the CNN-Noriega
dispute.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday the tapes were being
Blown out of proportion.
   ``This is not as grand an issue as it is described as being,''
Lehtinen said. ``I think the taping by the government will be found
to be quite correct. Privileged conversations ... are not
privileged when you get on a phone from a prison, and you know it
is being taped.''
   He said the judge may well rule the tapes are not prejudicial to
Noriega's case.
   May said that such a ruling would neither keep Hoeveler from
Finding CNN in contempt, nor end the gag order.
between attorneys and a client,'' May said.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct, but Hoeveler has not ruled on the issue.
   Noriega is jailed outside of MIami on a drug-trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to turn Panama into a
way station for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He has been held more
than 10 months and his trial isn't expected to begin before next
spring.

   Lawyers for Manuel Noriega headed for federal court
today for a hearing on whether the deposed Panamanian dictator
should be appointed a government-paid defense attorney, and also
sought to have the charges thrown out.
   Noriega's private defense team, led by Fran Rubino, had claimed
the U.S. government has sabotaged its work by freezing Noriega's
assets, leaving no money for legal fees.
   In what Rubino said may be one of his last acts in the Noriega
case, he filed a motion today to dismiss the charges, accusing the
government of a conspiracy to deny Noriega's rights to a fair trial
and effective legal counsel.
   The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping
Noriega's prison phone calls with his attorneys. Cable News Network
reported last week that it had obtained tapes of such calls.
   The defense motion also accuses the prosecution of illegally
freezing his funds, and says an unidentified government witness
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a
bribe to change his testiony.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday set a deadline
of today for Noriega's lawyers and the prosecution to work out a
payment plan. Otherwise, he said, he will declare Noriega indigent
and appoint an attorney on the U.S. payroll.
   If declared indigent, Noriega would be allowed two attorneys
paid a maximum of $75 an hour and investigative expenses of a few
thousand dollars.
   By contrast, the Justice Department has 30 lawyers on the case
and is prepared to spend up $30 million to prosecute Noriega on
charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombian cocaine
smugglers, Rubino said.
   The tight budget for indigent defendants makes it nearly
impossible for government-appointed attorneys to compete, said Yale
Kamisar, a law professor at the University of Michigan.
   ``You need investigators, you need experts ... to challenge the
government, to put them to the test,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Cable News Network has asked the U.S. Supreme Court
to overturn Hoeveler's ruling of last week prohibiting the
broadcast of taped jailhouse telephone conversations between
Noriega and his lawyers.
   On Thursday, the FBI, which is investigating how CNN obtained
the government tapes, seized tapes and papers that had been stored
in a CNN reporter's hotel room. The network claims the material was
improperly removed from the hotel room by security guards and has
demanded the FBI return it.
   Soon after the United States invaded Panama last December, the
Justice Department asked other countries to freeze 27 bank accounts
holding about $20 million in purported ill-gotten gains allegedly
controlled by Noriega.
   Hoeveler ordered about $6 million freed in June, but prosecutors
said the foreign governments then confiscated the money on their
own.
   Also at issue is $5.8 million in cash found by U.S. troops in
Noriega's offices in Panama. Prosecutors said that upon surrender
Noriega denied the money was his and that it was then turned over
to the Panamanian government.
   Rubino said Noriega never disavowed the money.
