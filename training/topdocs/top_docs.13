   The seconds are ticking down for the castle that once kept the world running like a clock. 

   Herstmonceux Castle, the home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, has been put up for sale. 
It is expected to be sold for more than $10 million. 

   The observatory, where Greenwich mean time was once calculated as the reference point for the world's time zones, is expected to move into Cambridge University in 1990. 

   Time has passed the operation by. 

   "The reason for the move from Herstmonceux Castle is that most of the observatory's observational work is now done overseas, atmospheric conditions abroad being far more favorable than anywhere in the British Isles," says Bill Yates, a London real estate agent. 

   The observatory's main functions now are confined to supporting its new telescopes in the Canary Islands and in Hawaii. 
In the past decade, Britain has only been a minor contributor to a Paris-based international time service that uses 250 clocks around the world. 

   The observatory decided in 1985 that for financial reasons it would let its six atomic clocks stop. 
The clocks contain the atomic element cesium, which must be replaced every few years at a cost of nearly $200,000. 

   Some British astronomers have criticized the decision to sell the castle in southern England, 21 miles northeast of Brighton in the county of East Sussex, and move the observatory. 
They say it will scatter the observatory's archives and rare books and end three centuries of independent excellence. 

   The observatory was founded in 1675 by King Charles II. 
It moved to its current site -- a 20th century copy of the original Herstmonceux castle -- in 1946 because pollution interfered with stargazing at its Greenwich location in southeast London. 

   The buildings at Greenwich, along with the brass strip marking longitude zero, the prime meridian from which the world measures its time zones, remain open as a museum.

<HEAD>`Leap Second' Puts Earth Clocks in Sync with Heavens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poised on the brink of a new decade the world
will pause tonight for just a second.
   A ``leap second'' will occur at the very end of Dec. 31, 1989,
making it the longest day of the year.
   The extra second is needed to keep the world's clocks in time
with the rotation of the planet, according to government
timekeeping officials.
   The turning of the Earth has always been the time standard for
humans, who marked the passage of days by the hours of light and
darkness and years by the seasons as the planet moved around the
sun.
   But while early timekeeping sought to measure the planet's
movement, today's clocks might be called more accurate than the
Earth itself.
   ``Time measured by the rotation of the Earth is not uniform when
compared to time kept by atomic clocks,'' reports the U.S. Naval
Observatory, the government agency in charge of keeping track of
what time it is.
   As a result of this difference, atomic clocks can get out of
sync with the Earth and have to be adjusted. Since it's the atomic
clocks that are used to set all other clocks, a leap second has to
be added or skipped from time to time to make up the difference.
   Fifteen leap seconds have been added to human time since an
international time agreement was signed in 1972, when a full 10
seconds had to be added to the atomic clocks to get them together
with the Earth. This will be the first leap second in two years.
   The leap second will occur officially at 23 hours, 59 minutes
and 60 seconds, Coordinated Universal Time, when a one-second pause
will occur before the arrival of zero hours on New Years Day.
   Coordinated Universal Time, popularly known as Greenwich Mean
Time, is the time experienced in London, England, and serves as a
standard reference for the world's timekeepers.
   In the United States, the actual adjustment will be made one
second before 7 p.m. EST.
   Atomic clocks are extremely accurate because they measure time
based on the frequency of regular events in atoms of cesium,
hydrogen, rubidium or mercury.
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly
called the National Bureau of Standards, is the government agency
in charge of timekeeping.
   Over the years the rotation of the Earth has tended to slow down
somewhat, and thus all 15 leap seconds needed so far have had to be
added to atomic clocks. If the Earth were to speed up, leap seconds
would have to be subtracted.

   The seconds are ticking down for the castle that
once kept the world running like a clock, a victim of changing
times.
   Herstmonceux Castle, the home of the Royal Greenwich
Observatory, went on sale Thursday for an estimated $11.2 million
to $18.7 million.
   The observatory, where Greenwich Mean Time was once calculated
as the reference point for the world's time zones, is expected to
move into Cambridge University in 1990.
   Time, apparently, has passed the operation by.
   ``The reason for the move from Herstmonceux Castle is that most
of the observatory's observational work is now done overseas,
atmospheric conditions abroad being far more favorable than
anywhere in the British Isles,'' said Bill Yates, a London real
estate agent.
   ``As a result, a new home base more suited to the requirements
of modern astronomy is to be built at Cambridge.''
   Astronomers were up in arms two years ago when the government
said it would sell the castle in southern England, 21 miles
northeast of Brighton in the county of East Sussex, and move the
observatory.
   Greenwich Royal Observatory clocks, first at Greenwich and then
at Herstmonceux, once calculated Greenwich Mean Time for the world.
But in the past decade, Britain has only been a minor contributor
to a Paris-based international time service that uses 250 clocks
around the world.
   The observatory said in 1985 that for financial reasons it would
let its six atomic clocks stop after 101 years of calculating
Greenwich Mean Time. The clocks contain the atomic element cesium,
which must be replaced every few years at a cost of nearly $200,000.
   The observatory's main functions now are confined to supporting
its new telescopes in the Canary Islands and in Hawaii, where clean
air permits observation, but Britain's astronomers still opposed
the move to Cambridge.
   They said it would scatter the observatory's archives and rare
books and end three centuries of independent excellence.
   The observatory was founded in 1675 by King Charles II. It moved
to its present location _ a 20th century copy of the original
Herstmonceux castle _ in 1946 because pollution interfered with
stargazing at its Greenwich location in southeast London.
   The buildings at Greenwich, along with the brass strip marking
longitude zero, the Prime Meridian from which the world measures
its time zones, remain open as a museum.
   Yates predicted the sale of the castle, which stands on 368 lush
acres, will generate inquiries from around the world.

<DATELINE> Sulgrave, England  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loose talk about the special relationship between the U.S. and Britain was once again in the air when I found myself here in Northamptonshire recently. 
As an antidote to the pseudo-history in the press, I decided to walk two miles down a country road and visit this village, where George Washington's ancestors are buried and where the Tudor manor house from which his great-great-grandfather emigrated to Virginia in 1656 still stands. 

   Were it not for this historical connection Sulgrave would no doubt be as unvisited as its neighboring small villages, tucked away in rolling farmland, but in 1914 a body of British subscribers, headed by King George V, bought Sulgrave Manor and presented it to the peoples of the U.S. and Great Britain to celebrate 100 years of continuing peace between them. 
Subsequently the National Society of Colonial Dames of America endowed the house with the proceeds from an appeal in the U.S. that enlisted 35,000 subscribers and exceeded its target of $100,000 by an additional $12,000. 
Since then it has become a focal point for a small but persistent stream of visitors willing to make the huge leap of imagination needed to associate this peaceful spot with the whirlpool of today's America. 

   The stained-glass panels in the window of the manor's Great Hall give them some help. 
They bear the arms of members of the Washington family (again represented in the carved spandrels over the South Porch doorway): three mullets (stars) and two bars (stripes). 
On the lawn flies the Star-Spangled Banner, and no one connected with the manor and its history believes this similarity in design is a coincidence. 
Col. John Washington took his family crest with him when he left England after having backed the wrong side in the Civil War. 

   It can be seen again in the little church of St. James-the-Less. 
Above the Washington Pew are four panels of Elizabethan glass, depicting the coats of arms of three generations of Washingtons: John, Lawrence and Robert. 
Also here are the memorial brasses of Lawrence and Amee and their four sons and seven daughters. 
To see them you must carefully roll up a slab of red carpet, protecting brasses now worn as thin as tissue paper. 
Behind the pew is a family tree, tracing George Washington's line back to King John and the barons of the Magna Charta. 
The Colonial Dames have been active in the church too, presenting an organ in 1931. 
A further reminder of Anglo-American links is the tower screen, light oak picked out in blue and red, a gift of visitors from the States, beside which hang the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes. 

   It is all very quiet and beautiful; golden marjoram bushes flame along the church path, and in the Deed Room at the manor daguerreotypes of George and Martha look down on General Washington's inkstand, snippets of Mrs. Washington's wedding dress and a ball gown, Washington's coat, his saddlebags and a shell button from the velvet coat in which he delivered his first presidential address. 
In addition there are a fine framed 19th-century Picture History of the United States, letters from Washington and other documents, as well as a square, squat and serviceable box: his liquor chest. 
Downstairs too there is a touching memorial. 
Installed by the Stars and Stripes Club of Manchester, it is inscribed with the names of 112 American soldiers who died and were buried in Manchester during the Great War. 

   But even in Sulgrave the 20th century has intruded. 
Not long ago thieves broke into the manor at night, planting their ladder in the exquisite herbaceous border and making off with 89 of the finer pieces from the collection. 
Rooms lovingly refurnished with fine period pieces now are missing clocks, chandeliers, chinoiserie, mirrors, a tea service and a set of early pewter plates. 
The carved Jacobean wooden wassail bowl that stood where Lawrence Washington once sat at table is gone, as is the famous Sulgrave clock. 
Fortunately the gilt frame of the Gilbert Stuart portrait of Washington was being cleaned at the time, and the thieves did not bother with the unadorned canvas. 
But their haul was worth comfortably more than a million pounds (about $1.6 million). 

   The Director, Martin Sirot Smith, is hopeful that at least some of the pieces will return: They all were catalogued and photographed and in 1972, after an earlier theft, the Sulgrave clock was returned from Berlin. 
But many of the smaller pieces may well not come home to roost and will have to be replaced, a painstaking and expensive task. 

   Nor is this the only problem that confronts the manor. 
Although the Colonial Dames actively maintain their interest -- 160 of them come every two years to take tea on the lawn -- upkeep is a problem. 
The original endowment leaves the house underfunded, deathwatch beetle and woodworm have to be contended with, and the demands of conservation are continually on the increase. 
No help is forthcoming from either government, nor from the British National Trust. 

   Mr. Sirot Smith has worked hard to improve the situation, notably with receptions this summer for members of the American Embassy in London and for firms with Anglo-American connections, celebrating the 200th anniversary of Washington's inauguration. 
Mr. Sirot Smith's earlier experience as an educationalist also was brought into play in July, when the manor hosted Histrionix, a history-reenactment society. 
Members lived in the house and grounds as they would have in the 18th century, including eating and sleeping] 

   With such efforts and with the steady stream of paying visitors it is hoped that Sulgrave Manor will remain, to quote the Marquess of Cambridge's opening speech: "A shrine for all Americans who visit the old country and a centre from which sentiments of good will between the British and American peoples will ever radiate; these sentiments we believe to be the greatest security for the world's peace." 

   About 15 miles from Sulgrave as the crow flies is Upper Heyford, a USAF base with an F111 nuclear force. 
With luck the special relationship that started with the Washingtons and that visibly flourished during President Bush's recent visit will survive to assist in rendering it obsolete.

FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Craftsman on a knife-edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER

<TEXT>
IT WAS a burning childhood ambition of Bill Galbraith's to have his own
clockmaking workshop. This ambition was doubtless fired by the fact that he
was bred to clockmaking, but was born not long before his grandfather's
clock shop was a casualty of that infamous recession of the early 1930s.
On demob from the Second World War, Galbraith headed for London and now has
his own business, with workshops in both London and Fowey, Cornwall. It has
taken time to get this far, and not without the assistance of Bill's silver
tongue to placate the bank manager. The economic climate has not been kind.
When he arrived in London, clock and watchmaking concerns abounded,
including such old names as Dent, Frodsham, Camerer Cuss, Asprey, Garrard,
and others. Of these, only Asprey and Garrard still maintain workshops - the
others are all gone.
In an unexpected way, Bill has benefited (if not profited) from this trend.
Cornwall was originally just for holidays, but one day a gas repair man fell
to talking over a job and showed a surprising understanding of the
intricacies of rebuilding a clock movement.
Not only was the gas man a former clockmaker, but he knew others in Cornwall
who were fellow cast-offs from the shrinkage of horological workshops in
London. The result is that Bill has set up a second workshop in Fowey, which
helps to reduce overall costs as the overheads are lower.
Bill's London workshop has provided a sound practical training ground for
commercial clockmakers and restorers. Many of his workmen have gone on to
set up their own workshops, having benefited from the quality of clocks
(many by Knibb and Tompion and Quare) entrusted to his care.
Such a grounding in commercial restoration is of inestimable good for the
trade as a whole. It cannot be gained at horological college where students,
rather than gaining specialist skill experience, are of necessity taught in
a somewhat uncommercial and academic environment and trained to cover all
three aspects of the modern craft - clocks, mechanical and quartz watches.
Bill's first clockmaking experience was gained in polishing nests of bells
for musical clocks. Done after school, his father, in true Scottish spirit,
paid him sixpence for each set: only recently he discovered his father was
actually receiving nine shillings for each set]
On arrival in London, an employment bureau got him a job at a small
clockshop off Liverpool Street. A rapid move to Bravington's (of 'make sure
its a Br-Br-Bravington's' fame) enabled him to cast round for the best
workshop to join.
Thus Bill came to Camerer Cuss in New Oxford Street, still run by the
descendants of a Black Forest clockmaker who emigrated in the 1780s. Terence
Camerer Cuss keeps the name going with an antique clock business in St
James's. But Bill set up on his own in 1969; fortunately, just before the
gaffer died, otherwise he would have felt obliged to stay on and help run
the business.
By then Bill was workshop manager at Camerer Cuss and had seen the
assimilation of the old precision watchmaking firm of Usher &amp; Cole. With
them came contracts for maintaining the marine chronometers of shipping
lines, so work had been specialist but varied.
There were departments for chronometers, cuckoo clocks, a timing division
for stopwatches, two separate clockshops and a watchshop. The cuckoo clock
produced was a specifically English model in the form of a Tudor house, the
first of which went to Prince Charles's nursery.
A couple of relocations later, Galbraith's London workshop is in Britton
St., Clerkenwell, the heart of the traditional clock and watchmaking
quarter.
Both these moves were forced on him by developers - the first, working next
door, having demolished the party wall, then proceeded to buy the freehold
over Bill's head.
The next shop was really a stop-gap, but he managed to get the old gas
turbine overhead belt-drive for the bench lathes going again. That was a
practical move, whereas occasionally using the gas bench lights was less
serious. In reality, no-one could see a thing, but what a marvellous draw it
made for American owners of clocks that needed working on]
Bill was always brought up to believe that a clockmaker should also be
capable of attending to clock cases. From this has arisen the fine art
division of his business. Freshly washed ormolu and gilt cases once returned
to a dealer's shop suddenly showed up all the other stock, which in turn
promptly arrived at Galbraith's for cleaning and repair. This side has
expanded so that while much is done in-house, some 23 skilled outworkers are
also called upon.
Singing bird boxes and other automata are specialities. A typical story is
of an elaborate early 19th century model tree with a singing bird automaton
that was promptly damaged again by its owner while stepping over it on the
floor. The decision was made to do extra work that had been held back on
first time round, and it's not kept on the floor any more.
A recent project has been true to Bill's origins - the production of a
series of 12 longcase regulators in fine mahogany cases. It's at moments
like this that Bill wishes that he could rip up an uncle's old loft floor
back in Glasgow, if it's still there, because the remaining stock of fine
Honduran mahogany from his grandfather's clockshop was used up there.
Making precision clocks by hand today does not really make economic sense,
as the full cost of man hours involved cannot be charged out to the
customer. But a clockmaker's lifeblood is not in bread alone.
Bill enthuses about the little details that go into making these clocks,
like jewelled pivot bearings and a knife-edge suspension for the pendulum.
There is not quite the same joy in his face when talking about an
alternative but necessary area of clockmaking to keep the coffers from
running dry.
New clocks for public locations involve such enticing tasks as working from
a hoist 45 feet up in the air in a blizzard last winter to link up the drive
work behind the clockface for the hands.
Public clocks can have a better side, when they are designed, as in a recent
clock, to have a triple tiered automaton of medieval soldiers, swans and
fish.
The mechanism may have to be electric, but the final result is rewarding.
Notwithstanding this new work, Bill's workshops hold together eight
clockmakers within a staff of 12, split between London and Cornwall. He
feels it is a great pity that 95 per cent of business comes from within 25
miles of Clerkenwell(including Heathrow). Where are all those clocks in the
West Country?

   The four clock faces on Big Ben clanked to a halt
for three hours Friday, and London's heart seemed to skip a beat.
   The government agency that services Big Ben and other state
buildings throughout the country said the clock stopped at 11:07
a.m. and was out of action until about 2:15 p.m.
   A spokeswoman for the Property Services Agency, speaking
anonymously, said the cogs that advance the clock's hands were
unable to turn even though the pendulum continued to swing. She
could not explain what caused the malfunction.
   Big Ben is the name of the 13{-ton bell, which chimes out the
hours from behind the clock faces.
   Stoppages are rare for the giant 131-year-old clock tower, which
has survived pollution, foul weather and war. The British
Broadcasting Corp. uses the chimes to introduce its 6 p.m. and
midnight newscasts, taking the sound live by microphone from the
tower. Its other newscasts use the atomic clock at Greenwich.
   In December 1986, it lost a note in the quarter-hour chimes
because of a broken connecting rod.
   The following month, the hammers that strike its famous bongs
that tell listeners the hour froze up in chilly weather.
Windshields were erected to warm up the clock's mechanism and get
it back on tune.
   The 20-story clock tower stands over the Houses of Parliament,
and one legislator took advantage of the latest stoppage to poke
fun at the policies of the governing Conservative and opposition
Labor parties during a House of Commons debate on socialism.
   ``Far be it for me to defend socialism or whatever brand or
variety the Labor Party is talking about,'' said Charles Kennedy of
the centrist Social and Liberal Democrats. ``I just cannot help but
reflect, however, as I walked in that Big Ben had stopped.''
   Although ``time has run out on socialism,'' said Kennedy, the
clock also seemed to have ``stopped on the conservatism of this
government.''

It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that stopped the clock of Big Ben three 
times last week, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of Parliament stopped 
at 5:11 a.m. Friday, which is about where they snagged on Wednesday and 
Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this morning, that the 
problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern face of the clock, and that once 
that bearing has been replaced or lubricated, that the problem will go away," 
said Toby Sargent, spokesman for the Department of Environment. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ben is the name of the bell that tolls the hours, but the name is 
informally applied to the clock as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock broke down 
during the hottest days of the London summer. On Thursday, the temperature 
reached 97 degrees.

<P>
"Free tickets to a Hollywood show!" Wood promised Volden and other visitors 
milling about the courtyard. Take a chance, climb on the free bus and get in on 
"a live television taping," he urged. 
</P>
<P>
Game shows are as old as television. But of the 450 or so shows that have hit 
the airwaves since 1945, only a few have been blockbusters. Many have trouble 
attracting a viewing audience, much less a studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Wood comes in. He helps recruit studio audiences for more than a 
dozen television shows being produced in Hollywood. To give the shows an 
all-American look, producers like to fill their studios with out-of-towners. 
And the catch phrase for most budget-conscious tourists is "free tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Wood's gambit worked the other day with Volden and 40 other tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Volden, 22, a recent college graduate who is looking for a job, is not one of 
those high rollers. So instead of buying a tour bus ticket to see the stars' 
homes in Beverly Hills as he had planned, he took one of Wood's. 
</P>
<P>
"The price is right," he joked after climbing aboard the studio bus for a short 
ride to CBS Television City. 
</P>
<P>
At the studio, the visitors were met by veteran television producer-director 
Marty Pasetta. He explained they would have the chance of a lifetime to help 
test a new quiz show called "Everybody's Equal" that CBS has imported from 
England and plans to broadcast this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The game uses computerized answer buttons that are wired to every seat in the 
studio. That makes everyone in the place a player -- unlike other game shows 
that carefully prescreen contestants, Pasetta said. Everyone in the audience 
would have a chance to strike it rich by winning the top $10,000 game prize, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The button pushing began once all audience members' names were entered into the 
computer. At first, all they had to do was beat the clock by selecting the 
correct answer within 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, though, the computer began measuring audience members' response times to 
the split second as they answered such questions as, "What day of the week are 
American presidential elections held?" 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Lau, a tourist from Melbourne, Australia, immediately tumbled into 
that trivia trap. Saturdays, when voters are off work, make more sense than 
Tuesdays for elections, she decided. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun," she said. But to tell the truth, "I wouldn't watch this show at 
home. I mostly watch documentaries." 
</P>
<P>
Louise Kilmurray of Bath, England, predicted CBS will hit the jackpot by 
picking up the British show. "I like it," she said. "Our shows are usually 
copied from America, not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Reynolds from Horseheads, N.Y., made a similar snap judgment. "I think 
it might be a hit," she said. "The show was fun. You don't get to do this on 
the East Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Visitor Aaron Medlock of Boston said free game show tickets let tourists have 
fun without putting their travel budget in jeopardy. "I'm finding out there are 
a lot of no-expense things to do in L.A.," he said. "This was complete fun." 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "Everybody's Equal" hope that network executives get the 
message. Nearly two-dozen stony faced officials in business suits filed into 
the studio during the show's test run and sat down in front of Volden to watch. 
</P>
<P>
But they never cheered or applauded. And they stood up as a group and marched 
silently out of the studio before the show ended. There was no give-and-take 
between them and the rest of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
It's anybody's guess what they thought about the show. 
</P>

<HEAD>Big Ben's Bearing Blamed for Clock's Third Stoppage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that has
stopped the clock of Big Ben three times this week, the government
said Friday.
   The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of
Parliament stopped at 5:11 a.m. Friday, which is about where they
snagged on Wednesday and Thursday nights.
   ``We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this
morning, that the problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern
face of the clock, and that once that bearing has been replaced or
lubricated, that the problem will go away,'' said Toby Sargent,
spokesman for the Department of Environment.
   Big Ben is the name of the bell that tolls the hours, but the
name is informally applied to the clock as well.
   Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock
broke down during the hottest days of the London summer. On
Thursday, the temperature reached 97 degrees.

THE OLD clock on the mantlepiece is the still centre of a household,
measuring a family's comings and goings from generation to generation. It is
a potent symbol of continuity, a thing of beauty, a marvel of precision. But
even clocks grow old, and antiques are in limited supply. Who today is
producing the sort of clocks that our great-grandchildren will revere?
David Poole, of Holmfirth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is one of the few
craftsmen whose name can be summoned up to answer that question. It is
always unnerving to meet perfectionists; doubly unnerving to meet a
perfectionist in horology. David Poole is a neat, precise, extremely modest
man; there is nothing intimidating about him. But the marriage of precision
with the objective of measuring time is bound to disturb anyone prone to
idleness, or mortality, or simple imperfections.
Last year the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers set up a competition for the
design and execution of a Perpetual Calendar Clock; the winning entry now
stands in David Poole's living-room. For as long as you live, this clock can
tell you in which second of which minute of which hour of which day - and
date - of which month you are living in.
The movement of the clock is similar to that of the regulators once used by
watchmakers to ensure precise adjustment of their watches. Such regulators
never carried perpetual calendar mechanisms, for fear of compromising
accuracy.
But the perpetual calendar mechanism in David Poole's clock is driven by a
separate falling weight which facilitates date changes (including the
accommodation of leap years) with minimal variation in the clock's
timekeeping. The duration of the clock is one month; the weight for the
calendar mechanism requires raising once a year. This is an innovative
clock. It is also a marvellously well-made piece of furniture.
Apart from the engraving of the numerals and dates, everything about the
clock bespeaks the skill of one man. David Poole produces all his own
components, down to the smallest screw or pinion. 'You actually make your
own screws?' asks the bumbling DIY dabbler. 'Of course,' he replies. This
self-sufficient perfectionism includes a catholic range of skills: design,
engineering, metalworking and cabinet-making.
David Poole teaches a couple of days each week at the School of Horology in
south Manchester; he spends most of his horological time repairing antique
clocks. So creating tomorrow's antiques is very much a hobby-horse, pursued
out of personal absorption. The prize-winning perpetual calendar clock took
18 months to conceive and construct. Mrs Poole rolls her eyes when you ask
her how much she saw of her husband during that time.
It is reminiscent of Matthew Boulton, favourite 18th century clockmaker of
Sir Nicholas Goodison, the distinguished antiquarian horologist and former
chairman of the London stock exchange. Boulton's masterpiece was a
'sidereal' or star-oriented clock, now celebrated by the Birmingham City
Museum. But no one would buy it when it was made - and Boulton gloomily
recorded that he would be more successful if he 'had made the clocks play
jiggs upon-bells and a dancing bear keeping time.'
Likewise, David Poole would probably make much more money if he created
clocks which squirted electronic minuets on the hour. But he is hopeful that
the quality of his work will win him the commissions he needs to design and
manufacture his own clocks, thereby relieving him of the onus of repairing
antiques.
In early April he joins a quintet of independent British clockmakers in
their first appearance at the European Watch, Clock and Jewellery Fair in
Basel. Making clocks for posterity is all very well - but it is the present
which either endows or cheats posterity. David Poole, Grad. BHI: Ramsden

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (3): How to reduce the risks - Why Buy
New? / Used cars may be worth buying, but you need to protect yourself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN BEFORE the door of your new car has shut for the first time and you
drive away from the showroom, its value has almost certainly dropped by
Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000. That happens as soon as the first name is
written on the registration document. The value of an average new car
plummets by about 30 per cent in the first year, so many buyers prefer to
let somebody else take that financial blow.
Of course, the vast majority of cars continue to depreciate throughout their
useful lives but the pace of decline slows markedly after the first two or
three years.
Those who regularly buy 'nearly new' cars usually do so to trade up to
something bigger or more luxurious than the new vehicle they could afford.
And a modern used car with 10,000 to 15,000 miles on the clock still has a
long life ahead of it.
'Cars today do last well and tolerate high mileages - 60,000 and 100,000
miles are not the frightening milestones they used to be,' says Mr Steve
Cropley, editor of Car Choice magazine. Neither is rusty bodywork the
problem it once was. 'Rust warranties are mainly horse manure but
manufacturers are doing a great deal - particularly using galvanised steel -
to make sure cars are much better in this respect,' he says.
Many cars have transferable warranties - some Japanese makes are offering
warranties for three years or 60,000 miles and Mitsubishi is offering one
for three years with unlimited mileage. There are 'extended' warranties
offered at a price on new cars, such as Ford's Extracover, and it is
possible for a used car buyer to purchase a warranty for up to seven years
or 70,000 miles (but don't expect too much from that one).
Some warranties are better than others. If a dealer offers one which does
not cover electronics and other expensive items, you could probably do
better buying a warranty direct from an insurance company.
However, there are always some risks associated with buying used cars.
For example: does the person selling the car really own it? Establishing
this fact is incredibly difficult.
'Astonishingly, there is no totally reliable way of proving who owns a car.
You can't rely on the registration documents, they show only the 'registered
keeper' who may not be the owner. It may, for example, be a leased company
car,' says Mr Simon Hinde, senior editor of Which? the Consumers'
Association's magazine.
He points out that, if you buy a car that turns out to be stolen, in nearly
every case you have no right to keep it. That is also the case if the seller
has leased or hired the car. However, if you buy from someone who has an
unpaid loan or a hire purchase arrangement outstanding for it, you do become
the owner. He or she has to continue paying off the loan.
The Consumers' Association, with the Office of Fair Trading and various
motoring organisations, is trying to persuade the government that the name
of the person or organisation who legally owns a car should be on the
registration document along with its full ownership history and the mileage
each time it changed hands.
While waiting for this legislation, buyers would do well to check with HP
(Hire Purchase) Information which has data on millions of cars provided by
insurance companies and finance houses throughout the country. The HPI
register can be checked via Citizens Advice Bureaux or, if you are in the
north-east of England, you can ring HPI's hot line on 0722 422422. For
Pounds 15 it will check a car out for you. This hot line scheme may be
extended to other parts of the UK if the test in the north-east works well.
Unfortunately, the HPI register is not infallible. For example, privately
leased cars - which pose a big threat to innocent buyers - are unlikely to
be listed.
Another way a buyer can protect him or herself, Mr Cropley suggests, is to
ask for the invoice that the seller received in buying the car. (In this
connection, it is also a good idea to keep safely the paperwork you obtain,
if you decide to buy.) Other documents might help, such as MOT test
certificates, for example, and servicing documents.
In any case, a would-be buyer should ask for documents giving the full
service history of any used car.
This helps to combat another big risk used car buying involves: 'clocking',
or turning the car's odometer back. Trading standard officers estimate that
one in five used cars has been clocked. A used car's price falls steadily as
the mileage rises and it is estimated that UK buyers pay about Pounds 200m a
year more than they should because of clocking.
Villains in the used car business are also getting better at repairing cars
written off by insurance companies. They can weld the bodies from two or
even three damaged cars together so expertly that only a very experienced
engineer is likely to detect the deception.
If you find out after you have acquired a car that it is a previous
'write-off', the law insists you inform any future buyer of this fact and
you will be lucky to get half the price of an equivalent, unrepaired
vehicle.
The best protection against this fraud is to ask for an inspection of the
car by an engineer from the AA or RAC. Many people believe this to be a
necessity when buying a high-priced used car.
The AA charges between Pounds 90 and Pounds 226 for each inspection and a
written report, depending on the size and complexity of the car; there is a
special telephone number on which inspections can be booked: 0345 500 610.
The RAC charges between Pounds 75 and Pounds 190 an inspection, plus a
Pounds 14 surcharge if the inspection takes place within the M25 London ring
road. The RAC has a Freephone number to book inspections: 0800 333 660 in
office hours.
Both motoring organisations say it might take two or three days before an
inspection can be made but they try hard to cut the time for people who are
in a hurry - perhaps because another potential buyer is lurking ready to
pounce.
While it remains important to follow the 'buyer beware' rules when buying a
used car from a private individual, such private sales are covered by the
Sale of Goods Act. This says the car must correspond with any description
applied to it, so it is a good idea to keep any advertisements about it and
take someone along with you as a witness to what is said during discussions
with the seller.
Of course, the safest way to buy a used car is from a reputable dealer.
Despite the Arthur Daley image, most dealers in the UK are honest, so ask
around and you will quickly establish which are those in your area with
decent reputations.
It would also be useful to arm yourself with information about prices. There
are several publications available which give guides to used car values.
The Consumers' Association also offers a 'Buying a Used Car Action Pack,'
available for Pounds 4.45 by mail order from PO Box 44, Hertford X, SG14 1SH
or by calling in at the Which? bookshop at 361 Euston Road in London.
Some final words of advice from the experts. Mr Cropley suggests you should
'avoid orphans' by which he means cars with unusual specifications (such as
three-door Sierras). This not only can cause difficulties if you want to
resell later, but also might give problems when spares are needed. 'Buy
popular specifications in popular colours,' he says.
Mr Hinde says: 'If you have any doubts (about a used car), question the
seller directly. If you are on your own, try to get answers in writing. Make
sure the condition of the car is consistent with the mileage shown. But
don't be put off by a few minor defects - it may pay to be suspicious of an
outwardly-perfect used car.'

   Tracy Scoggins is suing Miss USA pageant
officials for $14 million, contending they gave the actress a car
with markings that might have lured an attacker she says pulled
down her dress in an elevator.
   The lawsuit filed Friday in state court says pageant directors
should have warned her she was a potential sexual assault victim
and provided her security and an escort.
   Ms. Scoggins was loaned a car with the words ``Miss Universe''
written on the side in bold letters, the lawsuit says.
   The lawsuit, which names Miss Universe Inc., sponsor of the Miss
USA contest, is the third multimillion-dollar suit filed since the
alleged attack two years ago at the Marriott Hotel in El Paso.
   Ms. Scoggins, who appeared in the television show ``The
Colbys,'' was in El Paso as co-host of the 1988 Miss USA Pageant.
   Her screams in the elevator led hotel employees to detain Ramon
Concepcion Padilla. The actress said she would not return to Texas
to testify against him because a grand jury reduced the charge to
misdemeanor sexual assault.
   The charge was dropped and Padilla sued for $20 million,
claiming his reputation was damaged. Ms. Scoggins countered with a
$4.5 million slander lawsuit against Padilla and his lawyer after
Padilla contended the actress invited him to her hotel room.
   Efforts to get comment from the pageant company were
unsuccessful. Sara Meza, spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden TV
Productions, which produces Miss Universe, said she had not seen
the lawsuit.

   Crown Prince Naruhito, eldest son of Emperor
Akihito and first in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, moved out of
his parents' home Wednesday, five days after his 30th birthday, the
Imperial Household Agency said.
   The crown prince, who is regarded as Japan's most eligible
bachelor, had lived on his own only during studies at Oxford
University in England in 1983-85.
   His new two-story residence is about a 10 minute walk from his
parents' home in the same Akasaka Palace compound.
   Television footage showed the prince leaving in a car, with
Akihito, Empress Michiko and Naruhito's sister, Princess Nori,
seeing him off.
   The crown prince will have more than 7,500 square feet of space
to accommodate about 50 chamberlains and other palace officials
serving him.

   The Duke of Westminster, said to be Britain's
richest man, pleaded guilty Wednesday to driving his Jaguar more
than 30 mph above the speed limit and was banned from driving for
two weeks.
   A magistrate in Stroud, in central England, also fined the
38-year-old duke, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the equivalent of
$200.
   The duke's lawyer, Patrick Upward, said his client was traveling
from London to his country estate in northwestern England with his
wife and family when police clocked him driving at 106 mph for 3
miles. The speed limit for British highways is 70 mph.
   Upward said the duke is involved with 175 charities and
committees.
   ``He crisscrosses the country and to some extent the globe,''
the lawyer said. ``He has three cars, each of them 1-year-old and
each with over 30,000 miles on the clock. Almost of all of his
mileage is done while seeking to help the community.''
   The Grosvenor family fortune is estimated by London's Sunday
Times to be $5 billion, surpassed only by Queen Elizabeth II's $8.7
billion.

   Members of the rock group Aerosmith now
shun drugs but won't use the stage to deliver anti-drug messages to
teen-agers, lead singer Steven Tyler says.
   ``I will never go up on a soapbox and preach to the kids, `Don't
do, don't do, don't do.' I can only show them by example,'' Tyler
said in an interview published a day before a scheduled Wednesday
night concert.
   ``I can only say don't get started on drugs and try them because
it'll get you, grab you by the scruff of the neck just when you
think it's your best friend ... and it'll kill you.
   ``You only get three choices when you take drugs and that's
jail, death or insanity. I can assure them that. So when I do
articles and interviews, I talk about my past drug experiences with
needles, almost dying and how fortunate I am to come out of it and
be sane and still have my wits about me somewhat.''
   Boston-based Aerosmith is enjoying huge success with the album
``Pump'' only a few years after Tyler, guitarists Joe Perry and
Brad Whitford, drummer Joey Kramer and bassist Tom Hamilton
required treatment for drug dependency.
   ``We climbed out of this huge hole we'd dug ourselves and it
makes us feel a whole lot better about ourselves, our music and the
way we produce it,'' said Tyler. ``Fortunately for us, it shows in
the last two albums so well.''

   A growing interest in traditional interiors has helped pave the
way for the return of the grandfather clock to a place of honor in
many American homes.
   Originally known as a tall or a long case clock (it is still so
called in the antique circuit), it became a ``grandfather clock''
because of the popularity of the song, ``My Grandfather's Clock,''
around 1875.
   According to John Snellenburg, a vice president at Christie's
and a specialist in clocks and watches, interest in buying
grandfather clocks is high, though the clocks don't get much
publicity. Sales figures indicate such clocks are highly desirable
home accessories, he says.
   Those seeking a grandfather clock for the home have to compete
with serious collectors of fine American furniture as well as clock
fanciers who are interested in the development of horology.
   Snellenburg says there are plenty of grandfather clocks to go
around, however.
   The most important consideration in selecting an antique clock
is the condition of both the case and the works. Clocks are usually
survivors, he says, and unless one has been especially abused, it
probably can be put in good working order.
   A good quality English long case clock dating from the 18th
century or early 19th century costs from $1,000 to $3,500 at an
auction. The clock is likely to feature a painted white dial, often
with an arch, and a case of mahogany or oak. The same clock might
cost $3,000 to $5,000 in an antiques store, says Snellenburg.
   American clocks from the same era tend to be more expensive,
especially if signed by a famous maker. It would not be uncommon to
find prices of $40,000 to $100,000 for a signed Willard family
clock, he says. American country clocks might range from $4,000 to
$10,000.
   Snellenburg recommends considering grandfather clocks that are
neither antique nor new.
   ``Some of the 80-year-old clocks are a very good buy now,'' he
says. ``They have good movements and are usually copies of the
traditional English style.''
   When buying an old clock, choose a reputable dealer. If buying
from a dealer who doesn't normally deal in clocks, ask a specialist
to look at it before you buy.
   Old clocks most likely have appreciated in value as they age and
are likely to continue to appreciate if they are in good condition.
   But there are advantages to buying a new grandfather clock.
Today's clocks offer more features, as well as sizes appropriate
for today's interiors. They are dependable as timekeepers and offer
such features as triple chimes, ornate pendulums and a beveled
glass section to reveal the interior workings.
   Prices for new grandfather clocks range from $600 to $7,000,
depending on complexity of design, size and expense of materials _
rare burls, carvings, beveled glass, gold-plated dials. Bigger
movements cost more.
   Most contemporary grandfather clocks play as many as three
different melodies or chimes, says Philip Miller, executive vice
president of Howard Miller Clock Co. Few of the old clocks are
truly musical; they tell the time and strike the hour.
   Contemporary clocks chime the whole tune on the hour and partial
tune on the quarter, half and three-quarter hour. The melodies are
based on church chimes. For example, the Westminster chimes are
taken from a portion of the ``Messiah,'' by Handel, as rendered at
London's Big Ben; the Whittinton chimes are from London's St. Mary
Le Bow.
   In clocks that play three melodies, the chimes are like a music
box, with a selection lever. You can set the tune you want to hear.

   Dr. Gernot Winkler is a government bureaucrat
with plenty of time on his hands.
   Winkler's offices at the U.S. Naval Observatory are crowded with
sundials, hourglasses, bejeweled antique watches, pendulum clocks,
quartz clocks and atomic clocks so incredibly accurate that Winkler
has no excuse for being late to work.
   ``Our business is time,'' says Winkler, 67, an Austrian-born
astronomer and theoretical physicist who has been America's
official timekeeper for the past 24 years. A well-worn scythe, the
familiar emblem of Father Time, is propped up near his desk.
   Winkler's master timepiece is the atomic clock, which actually
consists of 24 box-like metal instruments housed in eight
climate-controlled vaults scattered around the observatory's
tree-shaded grounds on a northwest Washington hillside.
   Each of the faceless clocks contains cesium atoms which, when
heated to a low boil, emit faint beams of light from
electromagnetic radiation at an unchanging frequency of
9,192,631,770 cycles per second.
   Every hour, computers automatically compare readings from all
the clocks to produce a uniform time that doesn't vary more than a
nanosecond _ one-billionth of a second _ from day to day. Some of
the atomic clocks are accurate to one-tenth of a nanosecond.
   To set all his clocks, Winkler relies on a network of radio
astronomers from Hawaii to Bologna, Italy. They determine the exact
position of Earth as it rotates on its axis by taking a
simultaneous fix on some distant star sending signals from the
depths in space, millions of light-years away.
   The precision of the atomic clock seems unbelievable in a world
weary of wristwatches that suddenly stop and alarm clocks that
don't ring.
   It is so accurate, says Winkler, that it's not the clock but the
rest of the world that goes wrong.
   Every year or two, Winkler adds a ``leap second'' to the atomic
clock's time to compensate for a very slow decrease in the Earth's
rotation, which is thrown slightly out of kilter by winds, ocean
currents, earthquakes and even melting snow.
   Today's master clock is 10 million times more accurate than the
quaint old pendulum clocks that tick-tocked the official time until
as recently as 1950, when the observatory switched to quartz clocks
and then _ eight years later _ to cesium atomic beam clocks.
   Nonetheless, time doesn't weigh heavy for Winkler the way it
does for the Maytag repairman.
   No matter how flawlessly his atomic clocks run, he says, he must
keep trying to shave off another millisecond here or there to meet
the increasingly sophisticated demands of electronic navigation and
communications systems, from deep-running nuclear submarines to
satellites beaming weather advisories to airports.
   ``We don't wait for something to happen,'' he said. ``We need to
be in the forefront of technological capabilities. If we didn't,
we'd be as obsolete as the pendulum clock in three to five years.''
   Already, he says a possible successor to the atomic clock is a
new device that employs ions or electrically charged atoms of
mercury that are trapped in an electromagnetic ``bottle'' and
produce a fluorescent glow with a much higher frequency than cesium
beams.
   When he's not busy perfecting his clocks and keeping an eye on
the observatory's time-of-day announcements by telephone (dial
1-900-410-TIME), Winkler says he answers an occasional piece of
``nut mail'' about the time.
   Like the guy who asked, ``What actually happens to the time you
waste?'' Or the request for an exact definition of a moment.
   A woman's letter _ one of Winkler's favorites _ inquired what
God did with his time before he created the world.
   ``I wrote back that he invented hell for people who ask stupid
questions,'' he said.

<HEAD>Big Ben's Hourly Bell Stopped For 12 Weeks For Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big Ben's hourly bell, one of Britain's best-known
sounds, resounded over central London at 8 a.m. today for the last
time for up to 12 weeks to allow essential repairs.
   The famous clock over the Houses of Parliament will continue to
tell the time, but its hourly bong has been silenced.
   The hammer arm that strikes the bell to sound the number of
dongs for every hour is suffering from metal fatigue and will be
replaced, government minister Christopher Chope said last week.
   The clock's quarter-hourly chimes were also stopped for two days
while the hammer was being removed, a spokesman for the
government's Property Services Agency said. They will be stopped
again for the two days before the hourly bong resumes.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., which starts radio news
bulletins with a live broadcast of the hourly bells, said it would
substitute Big Ben with the clock known as Big Tom at St. Paul's
Cathedral.
   Big Ben, named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a government works
commissioner, first sounded in 1859. It is normally silenced only
twice a year when the hands are moved forward one hour for British
Summer Time in March _ the equivalent of daylight savings time _
and backward to revert to Greenwich Mean Time in October.
   Big Ben's longest silence was 22 days in August 1976 when a
shaft supporting the clock works shattered inside the clock room.
It last stopped for three hours in October due to a mechanical
failure.
   The name Big Ben actually applies only to the 13{-ton bell, but
it has become the nickname for the whole 20-story tower.

   For many people, the end of 1987 can't come soon enough. 
But now scientists are telling everybody to wait a second. 

   It seems we have an astronomical problem on our hands: The world isn't turning quite as fast as it used to. 

   Dennis McCarthy, chief of the U.S. Naval Observatory's Earth Orientation Parameters Division here, says the Earth's spin has been slowing for millions of years. 
Because of the moon's tug on the oceans, atmospheric friction and other effects, our day is perhaps two hours longer than the one experienced by a pterodactyl 150 million years ago. 

   The change was so gradual that pterodactyls, and, later, milleniums of humans, didn't notice it. 
But in 1948, a British scientist built the first atomic clock, and timekeeping hasn't been the same since. 

   Atomic time, now based primarily on the vibrations of electrons in cesium atoms, is accurate to within about a billionth of a second each day. 
Because it is oblivious to the earth's sluggishness, it eventually runs ahead of the Earth's rotation time. 
After a year or two, says the Naval Observatory's Mr. McCarthy, atomic time is out of synch with the Earth by maybe a whole second. 

   For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal, that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination. 
"If we let the difference grow," says Mr. McCarthy, "we could run into problems over thousands of years. 
It might be noon by atomic time, but dark outside." 

   The Naval Observatory is the nation's official timekeeper. 
As part of a world-wide 1972 agreement that keeps the Earth and atomic clocks synchronized, the observatory has ordered an extra second into our lives tomorrow. 

   This leap second, the 14th since the practice began, will delay midnight by exactly one second in Greenwich, England. 
At the same instant -- 6:59:60, Eastern Standard Time -- the Naval Observatory will add a 61st second for the U.S. 

   Though they may not notice, many New Yorkers will celebrate the leap second at midnight. 
The crowd that gathers at Times Square tomorrow night to watch the Big Apple ball drop will see, at the end of its descent, a one-second light show before 1988 officially arrives. 

   Mr. McCarthy, meanwhile, says he won't bother to add a second to his own timepiece. 
"My watch isn't that accurate," he says. 
"I lose a minute every couple of weeks anyway."

FT  29 JUN 94 / A tick on the old clock: Vanessa Houlder explains why every
second counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insomniacs will find tomorrow night even longer than usual. The night will
be extended by an extra second, to correct the earth's erratic timekeeping.
The extra second will be inserted at midnight, Greenwich Mean Time; but in
the UK, this means at 1am on Friday, because British Summer Time is one hour
ahead. An extra second will be broadcast in the national time signal, which
is transmitted by Rugby Radio Station, and the BBC may broadcast seven
'pips' in its time signal instead of six.
This leap second, as it is called, highlights some unexpected complexities
in the practical aspects of keeping time. For technicians, as well as
philosophers, the nature of time is a curiously elusive concept.
The difficulty does not lie in the accuracy of clocks. In 1955, when atomic
clocks were introduced, it became possible to keep time with hitherto
unknown precision. These clocks, which work by monitoring the frequency at
which an atom of the chemical element Caesium vibrates, are accurate to one
second in 1m years.
Rather, the problem arises with the traditional way of measuring time,
namely the length of a day. The length of the day depends on the speed at
which the earth rotates, which - despite appearances - is not constant.
Like a spinning top which gradually loses its momentum, the earth is slowing
down. As a result, it is occasionally necessary to add an extra second to
clocks, to keep them in step with the length of the day.
'It is a compromise,' says Ms Martine Feissel, director of Central Bureau of
the International Earth Rotation Service, a Paris-based organisation created
in 1988. 'On the one hand, there is high precision international atomic
time. At the same time we do not want to be too far from the earth's
rotation.'
The service is the world's authority on when clocks should introduce a leap
second. From its 30 radio stations all over the world, it makes minute
measurements of quasars - objects in the sky so remote that they can be
assumed to be fixed - from which it can calculate the earth's movements and
hence the moment at which it is appropriate to realign clocks.
The service decides whether to add a leap second six months in advance of
its introduction, which is generally in June or December - although there is
provision for the leap second to be introduced in March or September.
Ms Feissel cautiously predicts that the next leap second is likely to be at
the end of June next year. If so, it will be the 20th leap second to be
introduced since 1972. Before then, measurements of time were less precise.
At first sight, the addition of 19 leap seconds in 22 years suggests that
the earth is slowing down remarkably quickly. In fact, even if the speed of
the earth's rotation were to stabilise, the earth rotation service would
still be forced to declare the occasional leap second.
The reason lies with the definition of the atomic second, which is the
equivalent of 9.19bn vibrations in a Caesium atom. When the second was
redefined in terms of atomic vibrations in the 1960s, scientists decided to
base it on the length of a day in 1900, which is an important reference
point for astronomers. That means the occasional leap second is needed just
to make up for the slowdown in the earth's rotation which has already
occurred since 1900.
In principle, negative leap seconds, in which the seconds are left out
rather than inserted, could be needed as well as leap seconds. Although the
long-term trend is for the earth to rotate more slowly, there are periods
when it speeds up, for complex reasons concerning winds, tides and the
movement of the earth's molten core.
Is the time, money and effort spent on synchronising clocks with the earth's
movements well spent? On the face of it, the worst that would happen if they
were allowed to get out of kilter, is that the sun, moon and stars would
rise and set a few seconds earlier than previously. After all, for most
people, an extra second here or there is a matter of supreme indifference.
But for a small group of people, Thursday's realignment of clocks is vital.
For some scientists and navigators, clocks must remain in close
synchronisation with the rotation of the earth. Anyone using
astro-navigation on the high seas would find that a one-second mistake could
result in an error of a quarter of a mile in a ship's position. And that
could prove fatal.

<HEAD>Experiment Produces World's Coldest Temperature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Colorado physicists have
produced what they claim to be the world's coldest temperature _
within 1.1 millionth of a degree Celsius of absolute zero.
   That translates to 459.67 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Physicist Carl Wieman, who conducted the experiment with
graduate student Chris Monroe, said it shaved 1.4-millionth of a
degree Celsius from the previous record, recently achieved by
physicists at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.
   Absolute zero theoretically is the temperature at which
molecular motion stops. Temperatures in space drop to about 3
degrees Celsius above absolute zero, scientists said.
   Wieman said the achievement itself was not so important, but its
advancement of understanding about the basic nature of matter and
its potential practical applications are noteworthy.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced there will be an enormous number of
applications,'' he said.
   The scientists used $200 diode lasers _ the same kind used in
compact-disc players _ to trap atoms of the metallic element cesium
in one place.
   Restricting the atoms in a cage of laser beams caused the atoms
to slow down and cool, said Wieman.
   ``The whole setup has turned out to be a very inexpensive
apparatus that's giving spectacular results,'' Wieman said. ``We
have ideas on how to make this get much colder.''
   Wieman said one practical application of the technique would be
to improve the accuracy of atomic clocks by a factor of 100. Atomic
clocks, which count the oscillations of cesium atoms, already are
the world's most accurate timepieces.
   Cooling the cesium could reduce the atomic clock's margin of
error _ now about one second every 300,000 years, said Wieman.
   Wieman said the technique could lead to development of portable
atomic clocks that could be employed in submarines, spacecraft, and
other commercial applications.

<TEXT>
<P>
We were a bit late, wouldn't you know it, for an interview with the man who 
pays more attention to the time than anyone in this country. 
</P>
<P>
So when we entered the tiny paper-strewn office of our nation's timekeeper, we 
asked just what time it was. 
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, is exactly right," he said in a heavy Austrian accent, 
pointing confidently to an unadorned black and white clock on the wall, the 
only one in the room. "You can check it." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Dr. Gernot M.R. Winkler, director of the U.S. Time Service 
Department, picked up the receiver of his desk phone and dialed direct to his 
personal ally in the quest to form a more perfect world through the 
synchronization of time -- the master clock of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. Naval Observatory Master Clock. At the tone, Eastern Daylight Time, 14 
hours, 49 minutes, 38 seconds, beep. Universal Time, 18 hours 49 minutes 43 
seconds, beep." 
</P>
<P>
The message coming through the receiver was clear and ungarbled. It's exactly 
what Winkler expects from the master clock, a technological marvel that looks 
like a huge rack of audio equipment with a digital time readout and sits 
quietly in an environmentally controlled room about 10 paces from his office. 
</P>
<P>
It's the keeping of precise time by this clock that is responsible for 
maintaining order around the country. Without it, television broadcasts would 
interfere with each other, satellites would go haywire and planes and trains 
would never know when to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
My watch, a relatively inexpensive timepiece with a degree of accuracy that 
doesn't even merit mention in comparison with the master clock, said it was 
about 2:53 p.m. It was just a little fast, we learned, after receiving a couple 
of quick lessons in the more simple intricacies of the telling of time from the 
master himself -- the Time Lord, as Winkler's son has dubbed him. 
</P>
<P>
* Lesson One: The master clock tells time on a 24-hour system, widely used by 
the military and radio communications and scientific community. That means the 
day goes from 00:00 to 23:59. 
</P>
<P>
* Lesson Two: The world is broken into 24 time zones, so everybody has sunlight 
at noon and darkness at midnight. Of the 24 time zones, the United States is 
located in eight. Universal time is the time at the Greenwich meridian, the 
prime meridian from which all time zones radiate. The meridian passes through 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the easy lessons, we were soon to discover. 
</P>
<P>
We traveled to the U.S. Naval Observatory, located on 75 acres in the northwest 
corner of the District of Columbia, which oversees the enormous task of keeping 
precise time. Vice President Dan Quayle lives in an aging mansion on these 
grounds, and his tennis court is within view of the tiny time service building 
housing Winkler, his small staff and his master clock. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler, 67, is a physicist and an astronomer who has been managing the time 
service department for nearly a quarter of a century. Time is a passion for 
this serious man, who speaks of his "aesthetic attraction" to things precise. 
</P>
<P>
Taking off his glasses and fidgeting with them, Winkler sat back in his thickly 
padded desk chair and looked over a desk full of paper. Then he 
matter-of-factly explained that the first thing we needed to understand about 
time is that there is no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The simplest thing to explain what time is is to explain that it is just an 
idea which we developed from change, and the abstract measure of that change is 
time," said Winkler with authority. "It's really a human invention." 
</P>
<P>
The nature of time also makes it a subject ideal for humor. The temptation to 
make a joke with every detail is so great, we discerned the answers to our most 
burning questions about time early in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
No, Winkler is very rarely late (he thinks it's "tactless and impolite"), he 
doesn't work around the clock, nor does he watch the clock all day to pass the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He does have a theory of how to get more time in the day: 
</P>
<P>
"By not doing nonsense, useless things. Reading 99% of what is printed today. 
Listening to 99% of what people tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, by restricting yourself to the really valuable things, you 
have a big amount of time. You can be very well read by reading very little. 
Just don't fill your mind with garbage. That's the only way with which you can 
gain time. And a very effective one." 
</P>
<P>
Winkler said people take time for granted and don't really understand what the 
impact would be if time were not coordinated precisely. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of time is much more widespread than people realize. You may not know, 
for instance, that every television station operates on an atomic clock," which 
can be accurate to one second in every 300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"All the television stations, all the power stations, all the public services 
are very closely synchronized. If you drive an airplane, the systems that 
support that are very tightly synchronized. What we do is clear up the problems 
in all these stations in which we are in constant connection." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Winkler's job is to make adjustments to the clocks about once a year to 
synchronize the time determined by the rotation of the Earth with the time kept 
by the atomic clock. The Earth's rotation is not constant and slows over a 
period of time, so one second must be added to the master clock annually to 
synchronize the two. Called a leap second, it is based on the same principal as 
the leap day, which occurs once every four years. The leap day is necessary to 
synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, which also is slightly 
variable because of the inconsistency of the Earth's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler and his staff also provide astronomical data obtained from a variety of 
very sophisticated telescopes that measure the positions and movement of cosmic 
objects for use in navigation, space travel and scientific research.

<HEAD>London's Favorite Clock to be Silenced for Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big Ben, which didn't miss its hourly bell once
during World War II bombings, will be silenced temporarily for
repairs.
   Although the clock will continue to run uninterrupted, the
hourly bell will be stopped for 12 weeks, and the quarter-hourly
``Westminster'' chimes for two days, Government Minister
Christopher Chope said Wednesday.
   A mechanism needs replacing because of age, said Chope, the
minister responsible for the Property Services Agency that looks
after the clock.
   The faulty mechanism, the hammer arm that strikes the hour, will
have to be removed so a replica can be made, the agency said.
   Chope said work will begin March 26.
   Big Ben has been keeping time since 1859. It is stopped twice a
year when Britain goes on and off daylight savings time. In
October, it stopped for three hours due to a mechanical fault.
   In 1976 a piece of metal broke off the clockworks, forcing the
hourly bell to be silenced for 22 days and the chimes for several
months. The keepers of the clock said get-well cards addressed to
Big Ben arrived from all over the world.
   The name Big Ben actually applies only to the 13{-ton bell, but
it has become the nickname for the entire clock.
   The BBC normally carries live chimes from Big Ben before its 10
p.m. and midnight newscasts on domestic radio. It said it will use
a different time signal during the repair period.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- This New Year's Eve, Father Time
might arrive in the person of Len Cutler. For three decades,
he's tried to find the best way to measure time. Now, he has
an answer.
   Mr. Cutler and a small team of researchers at
Hewlett-Packard Co. have developed a new atomic clock touted
as being able to keep time to within a second every 1.6
million years. That's a vast improvement over the prior
record holder, which keeps time to within a second every
300,000 years, and light years ahead of the miserable quartz
watch, off a second a day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is "certainly the best commercial clock ever made," Mr.
Cutler says.
   Once upon a time, time was measured by the rotation of the
Earth and the movement of the solar system. But now, the
internationally accepted unit of time is based on the
resonance frequency of the cesium atom, which is about nine
billion cycles a second.
   Inside the new clock, this resonance synchronizes a
microwave signal inside a cesium-beam tube. All of this is
packaged inside of what looks like a personal computer
console with control buttons and a digital display on one
side.
   Hewlett-Packard is already taking orders for the device,
and expects to begin shipping in the early summer. Potential
customers include government agencies, telephone companies,
radio and television stations, defense contractors and
universities.
   Such timepieces, first developed in the 1950s, are used
more to synchronize than to tell time in the traditional
sense, allowing two computers on opposite sides of the globe
to transmit data accurately, for instance. More far-out uses
being discussed include measuring distances in outer space,
and proving Einstein's theory on the existence of
gravitational waves on earth.
   "The number of atomic clocks being used is increasing
dramatically," says one of the nation's official timekeepers,
David Allan, who builds and uses atomic clocks at the
National Institute of Standards and Techonology in Boulder,
Colo.
   Word of Hewlett-Packard's breakthrough, which was
officially announced yesterday, is already resonating among
industrial clock makers. "To a very small group, it is
certainly a step forward," even if it "has no importance to
most people," says Ralph Simons, a product manager for
Frequency and Time Systems Inc., a competitor.
   But Mr. Cutler says better timekeeping results in more
accurate data transmission, increased productivity and lower
costs. The cost of the new clock, including a
high-performance $66,000 model, certainly compares favorably
with some watches at better department stores, and
Hewlett-Packard says it has received a number of orders.
   Mr. Cutler says the clock will sell itself, even if it
isn't actually going to keep time for a million years.
   "We were joking," he adds, "that it would be neat if it
appeared in a Neiman-Marcus catalog."

FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Two houses clash their swords - Opera in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While musical life in London is taken up with the battle of the orchestras,
Parisians are in the fortunate position of being able to watch the rivalry
between two international opera-houses. An extra frisson is added when one
knows that political rivalry lurks in the background.
The Bastille (or, to give it its full name, the Opera de Paris Bastille) is
the vast new opera-house of the people, a state organisation, the treasured
project of Mitterrand and the left. Even at the opening night of the season,
jeans are de rigeur. The Theatre du Chatelet has a smarter audience than the
old Palais Garnier and is, if not snobbish, at least elegant. It belongs to
the city, the homeground of Chirac and the right.
Surely it cannot be a coincidence that they chose to open their 1993-94
seasons on consecutive nights, both mounting new productions, both turning
to the most ambitious large-scale German operas? The clash of swords can
almost be heard from behind the drop-curtain.
The Bastille came first. Its new production of Wagner's Der fliegende
Hollander was entrusted to the film producer Werner Herzog, who has already
essayed Wagner (without great success) at Bayreuth. He updated the opera to
the early years of the industrial revolution. Senta and her workmates have
dispensed with their spinning-wheels and operate a large textile machine.
Daland's men are first seen trying to haul their capsized steamship out of
the water - memories of Herzog's film, Fitzcarraldo.
The programme reminded us that Wagner was inspired to take up the myth of
the flying Dutchman after a perilous journey by sea to England, during which
storms forced the boat to take refuge off the coast of Norway. Herzog has
seized upon this image and set the opera in a frozen wasteland. An iceberg
looms over the scene; when the time comes for the arrival of the Dutchman's
ship, it rises out of the sea to a vast height and disgorges the wandering
mariner.
That is the limit to the production's entertainment value. Nothing that
follows suggests that Herzog has any point to make out of his choice of time
or place. Maurizio Balo's settings are impressive (so they should be on the
most lavishly equipped opera-stage in the world) but the characters could be
anybody, at any time, anywhere.
Somewhere along the line the Bastille had lost its scheduled baritone. Simon
Estes, a much-travelled Dutchman, took over, singing strongly, but not
making much either of the words or the personality. During the long duet
with Senta he hit an awkward patch where he seemed fated to arrive in tune
only one line in every seven. Sabine Hass's Senta was a cuddly figure, not
much given to obsessions or neuroses, who revealed most about herself when
she was punching out big, blazing top notes.
Nothing that passed between them was of any moment, although I hesitate to
blame the singers for that, as the same vacuum enveloped Aage Haugland's
booming Daland and Peter Straka's Erik. Myung-Whun Chung and the Bastille
orchestra received a roar of applause, which would be hard to justify. It
seemed to me that the performance needed a stiff dose of discipline to stop
it losing impetus and getting becalmed for long stretches at a time.
The next night at the Theatre du Chatelet - another coincidence. The
Chatelet's new production of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier was also set in the
period of the opera's composition. Adolf Dresen, the producer, had done away
with Rococo finery and set the piece in the years just before the First
World War.
If penny-pinching was the objective, he could hardly have done the company a
better favour. No need for all that gilt decor, brocaded upholstery and
sumptuous costumes. The Marschallin's bedroom consisted of merely a bed and
a grandfather clock (she must have a clock of some kind, if she is to stop
the time in the middle of the night). The Baron's seduction supper was held
outdoors in the backyard of the local Heuriege, not a plausible locale.
Visually it was a big disappointment, but Dresen scored by making his
characters really seem to live in that period.
It is unlikely that Felicity Lott will ever look more at home as the
Marschallin than she did here. With her willowy stance, sinuous arms,
elegantly casual walk, she is the picture of a society lady in the
20th-century understanding of the term. Morals had changed somewhat by 1910
and one imagines that she would easily forget this affair with a shrug of
her shoulders (oh, those shoulders] Are there any in opera today which work
harder?) The voice is only just weighty enough, even in this theatre, but
she floated the opening of the trio to graceful perfection.
Every comment, every look that passed between her and Randi Stene's
tousle-haired Octavian, as their relationship broke down, was heartrending.
No Octavian that I have seen has looked younger, more vulnerable than Stene,
an impressively confident young mezzo, and the sense of pain was akin to
needles piercing innocent young flesh. Cyndia Sieden was a delightfully
open, uninhibited Sophie. Kurt Rydl convincingly turned Baron Ochs into a
sharp-witted dealer in dapper suit and panama hat, quick to pocket the
croissant left on the Marschallin's breakfast table.
After his lacklustre showing at the Aix-en-Provence festival in the summer
Armin Jordan was a conductor transformed, keeping Strauss's music thrusting
forwards without slackening or sentimentality. He was fortunate to have the
Philharmonia Orchestra from London (sponsored by Rover France) on good form
in the pit. Why ever should this orchestra be facing the threat of closure
when it is proving such a high-profile ambassador for British music abroad?
The French must think us mad. Ironic to find the battles of British musical
politics being fought in Paris as well.

FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Hard times ahead - The antique
clock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUFFOLK dealer had a pleasant surprise the other week. He sold an antique
clock, his first transaction in eight months. During that period he had been
forced to give up his shop and he now deals from home. It is a familiar
story as the recession has further reduced business in a sector of the art
market which is traditionally quiet.
Private buyers are scared of buying antique clocks at auction and almost as
nervous shopping from a dealer. They are worried about how much of the clock
is genuine and how much restoration; they are concerned about the interior
mechanics and the costs of putting faults right; they wonder whether they
want a ticking, striking, object in their homes.
All this makes things hard for those in the antique clock trade, who can
offer some of the finest antiques of their kind at extremely modest prices
when compared with other objects of furniture.
One problem is that there are few rich international collectors for English
clocks. The Japanese have shown no interest and the state of the US economy
has reduced American buying.
There are a few keen native buyers, but since longcase clocks in particular
are space consuming objects, an auction house or dealer is lucky to see even
a committed clock customer three times in a lifetime - as he, or she,
purchases his longcase, his bracket, and his carriage clock.
At every specialist auction - Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips all hold at
least four each year - fine Georgian longcase clocks are on offer at Pounds
2,000 or even less, with bracket clocks of the same period fetching roughly
the same. Carriage clocks are usually under Pounds 1,000. To restore a
decorative longcase to pristine condition should not cost more than Pounds
700, or you can buy a perfect, guaranteed, specimen from a knowledgable
dealer at up to twice the auction house price.
A grandfather clock is an extra large longcase which earned the soubriquet
in the late 19th century in tune with a popular song of the day. As it
happens late Victorian longcases did reach monumental sizes and are one of
the most over-looked (in a collecting sense) - and cheapest - sectors of the
market, mainly because they are ill-suited to modern homes.
Not all clocks are cheap but most, perhaps especially the finest, are
bargains. The English clockmakers of the late 17th century, in particular
Thomas Tompion, pioneered the longcase clock after the invention of the
pendulum, and a very fine specimen of his work can fetches more than Pounds
200,000. Indeed, a rare blond wood Tompion set an auction clock record of
Pounds 880,000 at Christie's in 1989, only to be beaten a few weeks ago by
an art deco 'Egyptian' clock made by Cartier in the 1920s, which sold for
Dollars 1.5m.
Christie's is offering a Tompion ebony bracket at its July 3 auction, with
an estimate of Pounds 100,000. A year ago it would have been valued at twice
this sum, but the clock market has shared in the general antique depression
and in order to attract potential bidders Christie's has gone for an
enticingly low guide price.
Recent auctions have been encouraging. The trade is well stocked, but
private buyers are becoming aware of the bargains on offer and although
estimates have generally been fixed 25 per cent down on a year ago, take up
has been good. If anything, there has been a swing away from longcase
towards the smaller bracket clocks. It is a good idea to make a bid on an
unsold lot after the sale: often the vendor will let it go cheaply.
The problem has been to persuade sellers to risk their clocks on an
uncertain market. For them the alternative is to go to the specialist
dealers. Charles Lee, of R. A. Lee, reports more enquiries from owners
wanting the assurance of a private sale to avoid the vagaries of the
saleroom. He is currently nursing a rather nice Joseph Knibb of the 1660s
which carries a price tag of around Pounds 150,000.
Joseph Knibb, George Graham and David Delander make up the second rank of
English clock makers, but their prices are a fathom below those of Tompion
and rarely break the Pounds 100,000 barrier. Tompion is a name known and
revered by the very rich who collect the finest antiques by the acknowledged
masters. Although he was prolific, with his workshop producing at least 500
numbered clocks, he is a safe investment.
The hunt is on among dealers and auction houses to promote equally
prestigious names. The best on offer at Sotheby's on May 30 is a George II
walnut longcase of around 1752 by Samuel Barkley and Thomas Colley, which
carries an estimate up to Pounds 45,000. Clocks of this period usually go
cheaply, but these two makers were pupils of Graham who in turn learned his
skills from Tompion, so Sotheby's is suggesting a continuing tradition of
excellence. Sotheby's also has a longcase by one of the later Vulliamy
generations, dated 1820 and estimated at up to Pounds 30,000.
For its part, Christie's, apart from the Tompion, has a carriage clock by
James Fergusson Cole which is billed as the earliest English carriage clock,
dated to 1823, estimated at up to Pounds 70,000. Regarded as the equal, or
better, of anything produced by the celebrated Swiss innovator, Breguet, it
is an enthusiast's clock but should find a buyer. However the auction houses
are keeping back their best Tompions until the autumn, when they expect the
economic clouds to have been dispersed. Sotheby's will then be offering six
clocks from the celebrated collection of Lord Hereford.
The dealers cannot enjoy such delays and although their prices will be
higher than those prevailing in the saleroom you will have a guaranteed
clock in fine working order. Anthony Woodburn of Tunbridge Wells has access
to clocks as good as any passing through the auctions. At next month's
Olympia Antiques Fair, you will find Strike One of Islington, which
specialises in lantern and chinoisserie lacquered longcase clocks, and
Gerard Campbell, who deals mainly in early 19th century Viennese regulator
clocks. The Clock Clinic, which restores clocks, is also taking space at
Olympia.
At the even grander Grosvenor House Fair, R. A. Lee will be showing
furniture as well as clocks. It is a sad postscript to the clock market that
while the best 18th century and Regency English furniture thrives during a
recession, clocks of the period are regarded as different and difficult. In
the past, the best furniture dealers embraced clocks. A little knowledge and
the advice of an expert can open up the mysterious world of clocks and
owners can enjoy a useful decorative, and appreciating, domestic friend.

   Once upon a time nobody could tell time. Well,
they sure can now, down to the nanosecond. On the day we return to
standard time, here are some ruminations by one of America's secret
addicts, a time freak.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a time to reap and a time to sow and a
time to set the clocks back. Today. For a growing number of
Americans, it is a time fraught with excitement.
   I am one of that number. I am a time freak. High time I
confessed.
   No telling how many of us there are in America. Addiction isn't
something you go around talking about. One time freak, however, can
spot another. The other day someone asked my friend, Jim Smith,
what time it was. He replied, ``eight-thirty-two-oh-three.'' No
doubt about it. Jim Smith is one of us.
   A time freak would no more say ``about half past eight'' than a
brain surgeon would say ``about three or four centimeters.''
   Time addiction, a compulsion for split-second exactitude, began
its insidious boring into the American psyche during the 1970s. The
specific date is inexcusably imprecise. But the culprit is not.
   It was the infliction upon an unsuspecting populace of the
quartz watch.
   Like most addictive agents, quartz watches come cheap and easy.
In New York, you can buy one on the street.
   Experts will tell you that when it comes to accuracy, the most
bejeweled chronometer ever crafted by a Swiss master can't hold a
candle (once used to tell time, by the way) to a plastic stick-on
quartz watch you can pick up at the supermarket checkout for $2.49.
   Time addicts aside, America seems to have become a nation of
clock addicts as well. There's a difference.
   When I was a boy, my father had a pocket watch and my mother had
a clock in the kitchen. That was it. The time change was
accomplished, as it were, in no time.
   Today, or last night rather, I had the following to reset:
   My watch, her watch, the kitchen wall clock, the stove clock,
the microwave clock, the telephone clock, the radio clock (Five in
the kitchen. Five!). The den wall clock, the VCR clock, the foyer
clock, the two clocks in the living room, the four radio-alarm
clocks upstairs, the travel alarm and, finally, the car.
   Eighteen, then. And if you're a time freak, this can't be done
casually. No indeed. All those clocks must agree precisely and all
must be right.
   So first you must determine the exact time. From the radio? From
the local number in the phone book? Never. Not if you're serious
about this business. If you're truly time-addicted, you go to The
Source.
   You phone 1-900-410-TIME. It's a toll call but money is of no
consequence; time is of the essence. Or you phone 202-653-1800.
Either number will connect you with the nation's Master Clock at
the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. A recording will
give you the exact time, to the second, at the tone.
   But wait. Just to be sure, you must also phone 303-499-7111. You
will reach the National Institute of Time and Technology in
Boulder, Colo., where the tone will tell you Coordinated Universal
Time. Universal!
   And if you're wondering how many time freaks are loose in the
land, out there glancing at their quartz watches, here's one
indication. The observatory averages about 6,000 calls a day on
both its numbers, the NITT in Boulder about 5,000.
   That's nearly 7 million long-distance calls a year, folks, just
to find out what time it is. Could this addiction be nearing an
epidemic?
   ``The numbers keep increasing,'' says Sheila Faulkner, who keeps
track of the observatory calls. ``That's why we added the 900
number. The other line was often busy. The 900 number can handle
8,000 calls simultaneously.''
   Ms. Faulkner also observes that the heaviest calling periods are
Monday mornings and Friday afternoons, the daylight-standard change
days, and New Year's Eve. ``Both our numbers have peaked on New
Year's Eve, 40,000 on one phone and 36,000 on the other.''
   All those New Year's Eve callers probably aren't true time
freaks, though. Like New Year's Eve drinkers, they likely include a
fair number of amateurs.
   If time freaks are a fairly recent breed, their opposites, those
who could not care less about exactitude, have been around for ages.
   The Navajos, for instance, feel it is far more important to live
in harmony with nature's own rhythms. A favorite of tribal
festivals is a prankster dressed in a three-piece suit, waving a
big alarm clock and shouting ``Time to be hungry!''
   ``Confound the man,'' wrote a Roman poet named Plautus in 200
B.C., ``who in this place set up a sundial to cut and hack my days
so wretchedly into small portions.''
   You have to wonder what old Plautus would have thought of David
Allan. Allan can cut and hack a second of time, one tick, into a
billion parts, into nanoseconds.
   He is the head of the time laboratory at Boulder's National
Institute of Time and Technology, formerly the Bureau of Standards.
You might say David Allan is America's Father Time. It is Allan who
decides how long a second is in the first place. His lab sets the
standard.
   Before 1967 time was measured by astronomical instruments. They
were accurate to a millisecond, a thousandth of a second. Since
then the standard has been an atomic second, measured by an
electron spinning around the nucleus of a cesium atom like the
Earth around the sun. It's more complex, but there's no time to go
into it.
   Let's just say that that electron spins around that nucleus in a
regular pattern, a frequency. When it spins 9,192,631,770 times,
that's a second.
   ``It takes a good counter to count it,'' Allan says, ``but we
can do that.''

FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Classics
still dominate - Antique Clocks and Watches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAST year started as a frustrating one in the market for second-hand
clocks and watches, governed as it by a long wait for an upturn. More
recently there have been traces of a silver lining - in the shape of an
overhaul of international exchange rates following Black (or White?)
Wednesday.
Since then the mood has been distinctly more upbeat for the first time since
the dizzy heights of late 1989/early 1990. The big names - Patek Philippe,
Rolex, Vacheron &amp; Constantin, Audemars Piguet, Lange, Breguet and Cartier -
still dominate the field, with the most sought-after models being the
complicated and technical models.
Cartier watches were feared to have peaked a year ago but this has proved
not to be the case. A pre-war Driver watch, curved to the wrist for easier
reading at the wheel, sold for Pounds 52,000 at Sotheby's Geneva in
November, and a very rare eight-day watch sold for SFr170,000 (Pounds
75,000) as against a previous high of Dollars 98,000 (Pounds 63,630)
Patek Philippe, commonly seen as the most 'blue chip' brand, has suffered
recently from choosy collectors and its performance at auction remains
patchy. Rectangular models are now back in fashion while square ones are
still difficult to sell, but round models of particular complexity are
making big prices.
Standard Patek perpetual calendars in gold cases currently sell for about
Pounds 18,000 compared with Pounds 20,000 in 1989/90. Their Officer's watch,
brought out in 1989 to celebrate their 150th anniversary, was sold in one
instance in January 1990 for Pounds 19,800; now it commonly makes Pounds
8,000 to Pounds 10,000 but this is still way above the original retail price
of Pounds 4,700.
Such premiums are a much rarer thing than they were although the Rolex
Daytona Cosmograph Chronograph models and older, Rolex chronographs and
vintage bubble-backs continue to be sought after.
The Swatch, the ugly duckling of the collector's wristwatch market, is no
longer a swan and indeed is now flying lower than before. No one has or is
planning to hold a specialised sale or even a themed section in a sale this
year. Only those in absolutely 'as new' condition and early 1983/4
prototypes seem sought-after.
Ruth Zandberg of Christie's Geneva says new collectors are looking for
'early (pre 1700) watches' and Antiquorum has had some good results in this
field.
Sotheby's London enthuses about an exceptionally small clock watch of c1620
that automatically strikes the hours in passing; estimated at Pounds 80,000
in their forthcoming Harcourt sale. Prettily enamelled, it also has that
essential extra ingredient - a bit of history - as it was given by Elizabeth
of Bohemia, Charles I's tragic daughter better known as the Winter Queen.
The antique clock market seems to have been playing a waiting game at the
top end, while seemingly recession proof and quite active in lower ranges.
Rumours are that some high-flying clocks should sell well this summer and if
so this could flush more out on to the market.
More and more activity these days takes place at antique fairs, which has
enabled the public to look and buy at leisure and introduced new customers
to individual dealers. London's well-established Grosvenor House (June 9-19)
and Olympia Fine Art and Antique Fair (June 3-13) now in its 20th
anniversary year, as well as the new British Antique Dealers Fair at the
Duke of York's Headquarters (May 5-11) will have good horological showings.
Clocks and watches can be a particularly fraught subject for the amateur
sales-room hunter as goods at auction are sold 'as found'. Buying from a
reputable dealer offers the reassurance of properly restored and overhauled
pieces guaranteed under the Trades Descriptions Act.

his true passion: turning back the hands of time.

Baisa reproduces neon clocks that were the advertising rage of the 1930s and 
1940s and are now making a comeback with businesses and consumers.

"There isn't a night that really goes by that I'm not out here," said Baisa as 
he surveyed the workshop where he makes replicas of neon timepieces for

Neon signs first appeared in the United States in 1923 at a Los Angeles auto 
dealership. Neon clocks began showing up in the 1930s in theaters and soda 
fountains. A smaller, 12-inch table-top model appeared on the back bar in 
taverns and lounges.

Brightly Colored Clocks 
</P>
<P>
Baisa, 48, has admired the brightly colored clocks since the days of his 
childhood in San Francisco, when he often would go to matinees and gaze at the 
green glow of the clock next to the movie screens. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of neon clocks came to a jarring halt in the 1950s, when 
incandescent and fluorescent signs appeared and television emerged as the main 
visual advertising medium. 
</P>
<P>
But that age of neon clocks never ended for Baisa. In the late 1960s, he 
already had begun work at Palo Alto-based Beckman Instruments -- makers of 
medical instruments -- and spent his spare time winning motorcycle races. 
</P>
<P>
But he continued to be a clock watcher. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Baisa began to make reproductions of the clocks, based on the famous 
Glo-Dial line, since restoring often cost too much and old clocks were hard to 
find. Then he had a brainstorm -- add personal messages to the clocks. 
</P>
<P>
His reproductions can look just like the originals, including the precise 
lettering, plus added personalized sayings on the glass and two-tone colors for 
the neon. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want something close enough and want it for another 40 years," 
consumers will buy the reproductions, said Baisa, a medium-height, stocky man 
with a graying mustache and beard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Logo on Each Unit 
</P>
<P>
Baisa said his business logo, Ken-Glo Clocks, is printed in small letters on 
every reproduction so that it cannot be passed off as an original. 
</P>
<P>
He reproduces five basic models of the old-style neon clocks, including the 
hexagon, the 12-inch table-top, the 14-inch wall mount, the "chase wheel" and 
the 23-inch type. 
</P>
<P>
"Chase wheel" refers to neon that becomes an optical illusion, with the 
surrounding wheel of neon appearing to move faster as someone moves back from 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from $295 to $650 for Baisa's clocks, which are sold from a co-op 
store he and his wife, Sandy, belong to called Collector's Market Antiques near 
his home in San Carlos, a small city 25 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He said his clocks are better than the originals because he has improved on the 
on-off switches, the painting and the chrome plating. 
</P>
<P>
The art work, performed by co-worker Allen Gianoli, is also top-quality and 
will include whatever the customer wishes -- if there's room on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I want somebody who's going to pay that kind of money to be proud of it," 
Baisa said, admitting that he enjoys hearing customers' compliments when they 
come to pick up their prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect Baisa to quit his job any time soon so he can make oodles of 
clocks and reap higher profits. "That's not the fun of it," he said. 
"Everything I do is like creating something again. 
</P>
<P>
"You start getting people mass-producing them, it won't be the same," he said. 
"They'll be like jukeboxes. They won't be a collectible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Each One 
</P>
<P>
His clocks are such one-of-a-kind creations that he takes a photograph of each 
one before shipping it off to the customer. He's received orders from as far 
away as England, France, Japan and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
One 23-inch clock still in his garage -- his workshop shares space with a 1934 
Ford car he has been planning to restore for four years -- belongs to San 
Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The red-orange clock reads "San Francisco 49ers World Champions Super Bowls 
XVI, XIX, XXIII" around the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Baisa said DeBartolo wants it for his trophy room. 
</P>
<P>
"I went more for authenticity than I did for production," he says of his 
reproductions. "I want people to think this is a 10-plus. I got to make them 
like they were."

   The arrival of 1991 has been postponed.
   The new year will be a second late, to accommodate a ``leap
second'' that will be inserted Dec. 31 to keep clocks in time with
the Earth.
   The problem is that modern atomic clocks are too darn accurate.
   They hardly vary at all, being accurate to within a billionth of
a second a day, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory, the
government office in charge of keeping track of what time it is.
   The rotation of the Earth, on the other hand, isn't nearly that
consistent.
   It speeds up a bit sometimes, slows down other times.
   Our original clock, the rotation of the Earth, is consistent to
only about one-thousandth of a second a day, says the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency in charge of
measuring units of time.
   In the past, slight irregularities in the Earth's rotation
didn't matter.
   But now, the really accurate clocks get out of time with the
slightly wobbly world. And since the planet can't be adjusted, the
clocks must be.
   Because the Earth as slowed a bit, the clocks have been getting
ahead of it. They must be slowed down to keep them on time.
   This year's leap second will occur at 23:59:59 universal
coordinated time. That's 6:59 p.m. and 59 seconds, Eastern Standard
Time.
   Normally, 6:59:59 p.m. EST is followed by 7:00:00. But on Dec.
31 of this year it will be followed by 6:59:60, and that will be
followed by 7 p.m.
   Universal coordinated time, formerly known as Greenwich Mean
Time, is the international time standard.
   The international agreement calling for the insertion of a leap
second, when needed, was signed in 1972. This will be the 16th leap
second added since then.

FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: The ultimate in accuracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR TELLING the time with style and status, you can't beat that gold Rolex.
When it comes to measuring the age of a spot of Jurassic silt or the
life-span of a quark, it takes instrumentation on a more cosmic scale.
In the last 30 years, science has provided techniques to measure time with
impressive accuracy. For example, precise dating of pottery shards can give
invaluable information to archaeologists. Using the phenomenon known as
thermoluminescence, a specially designed oven unit linked to a standard
personal computer and a printer can produce a glow curve from which a
reliable dating can be made.
Thermoluminescence builds up over the years as a result of environmental
radiation, and the energy is stored in the crystal lattice. When samples of
the pottery are heated in the oven unit, the energy is given off in the form
of light, which can be measured to show how long the pottery has been
absorbing radiation.
Although the principle of dating pottery by measuring thermoluminescence was
first proposed in 1953, a practical method has only been developed since
about 1960, at Oxford University's Research Laboratory for Archaeology and
the History of Art. The laboratory is able to offer the service commercially
to academic institutions, museums, and auction houses such as Sotheby's. It
is, in the opinion of Professor Edward Hall, former head of the laboratory,
one of the few entirely reliable scientific tests for dating material.
Organic matter contains minute quantities - one part in a million million -
of carbon 14, a radioactive isotope of carbon which decays at a known and
constant rate. By measuring the quantities of carbon 14 present, it is
possible to determine the age of ancient remains. Carbon 14 dating has been
possible for about 30 years, but the old technique required 10 grammes of
material - an impractically large amount when attempting to determine the
age of potentially priceless artefacts. Professor Hall's contribution was
the accelerator mass spectrometer, which could produce accurate results with
a sample 10,000 times smaller.
The Oxford laboratory now tests up to 1,000 samples a year, originating in
environmental studies and oceanography, archaeology and fine art. The most
publicised artefact ever tested at Oxford was the Turin Shroud.
When measuring time in the present, as opposed to the past, it is the
caesium clock which is now the ultimate reference. Dependent on the
vibration of the caesium atom, the frequency of which is extremely stable,
atomic clocks are so accurate that, were they to be set at the birth of
Christ, they would still be correct today to within 15 decimal places.
Dr Denis Vaughan, of the Science Museum, London, showed me an early example
of a caesium clock - an imposing installation. Present day instruments are
more compact, about the size of a suitcase. Hewlett Packard produced the
first portable caesium standard atomic clock in the late 1950s, and are
still world leaders in their production.
Developments now enable you to have atomic time in your own home. In 1988,
the German company Junghans introduced a clock with a radio receiver inside
it.
Similar in principle is a quartz watch, also produced by Junghans, which
works off a transmitter in Frankfurt. It has an aerial built into the watch
strap, and, at night, when laid flat on a bedside table, it will receive a
radio signal from the atomic clock, automatically adjusting the time.
And the next step? 'This is the ultimate, as far as accuracy is concerned',
says Dr Vaughan. 'It's difficult to visualise anything further.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Vintage models help to put a
spring in the market / Finding that collectors are willing to pay plenty for
old-fashioned styles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people own a wrist watch, probably a quartz model powered by a battery.
But some may still retain the first watch they ever had - which, almost
certainly, will be of the wind-up variety.
These old-fashioned mechanical models appeal far more to watch buffs than
the mass-produced modern product. Add an element of power dressing  -
through the clout of recognised up-market brand names combined with imposing
multi-function displays on the dials - and you have the essence of a serious
market for collectors. This goes some way towards explaining why a Patek
Philippe perpetual calendar and moon phase wrist watch - one of only three
examples in a platinum case - went on to sell for Pounds 308,000 after being
taken into Sotheby's for a chance valuation.
Patek is the leading name among the big six of the collectors' world (the
others being Rolex, Vaucheron + Constantin, Jaeger le Coultre, Audemars
Piguet and Cartier). Patek is the Rolls-Royce of the industry, while Rolex
has the most rugged appeal and Cartier the edge for style. The undoubted
cachet of Cartier - especially for watches in the now timeless Art Deco
style, for which the company is known best - has meant that Cartier's are
the only second-hand women's watches of serious market value.
While women still prefer a new watch, vintage models remain a male preserve
in much the same way as classic cars. Gone, though, are the days when
current models of complicated watches produced by the big six (basically,
reviving types made in the 1950s and '60s) habitually made more at auction
than their list price.
The three leading watch auctioneers - Sotheby's, Christie's and Antiquorum
of Geneva - now report sales of current production models at or near list
prices. This is a direct reflection of a slackening (but not collapse) of
demand because of the recession, which has meant that manufacturers' waiting
lists have all but disappeared.
One exception is Rolex. Its Submariner and Daytona models still have long
waiting lists - distinctly Italian-led - and anyone lucky enough to secure
one can sell it for an immediate profit.
Theme sales have been one way of trying to maximise results in an
increasingly choosy market. The first of these, by Antiquorum for Patek in
its 150th anniversay year, was nearly a sell-out. The same auctioneer
concentrated this time last year on Breguet, but the market was much more
finicky and the sale, although yielding a satisfactory total, was by no
means a runaway success.
Swatches have been the surprise ugly ducklings in this field since, in the
public's mind, they mix mass production with a hyped fashion appeal. But not
all Swatch models are made in high-number series; take, for instance, the
two Velvet Undergrounds enveloped in black or white stocking mesh which sold
for Pounds 7,000 at Christie's in London on May 8.
This sum - at the bottom end of the estimate - for these 1985 models,
produced in 500 examples only, was still a respectable performance in a
themed section of a general sale which, the auctioneers admitted was not as
buoyant as had been hoped, and contained a high level of casualties. Thus
the Swatch market is coming of age.
American, German and Swiss collectors have been concentrating on the more
unusual examples, such as variants of production models, test pieces,
prototypes, and hybrids such as those made by Swatch employees for their own
amusement. One such 1984 hybrid made the highest price of Pounds 8,460 at
the April Antiquorum sale.
Pocket watches are a much older market which, at one stage, threatened to
become inactive. While 18th and 19th century decorative watches are still
not the hot properties they used to be, prices have held on to the 30 per
cent rise at the start of last year. Thus, an Empire-period enamelled gold
watch now makes Pounds l,800 compared with the Pounds l,200 it used to
fetch. This, though, is still less than the Pounds 2,500 such a watch would
have made late in the l970s.
There must be bargains here, if only a new generation of people collecting
decorative pocket watches could be inspired. Sotheby's in London seems to
have a very good selection in its next sale on June 4, with more than 200
lots.
But whereas decorative watches are plentiful, high-precision pocket models
from the Iate 19th and early 20th centuries are in such short supply at
auction that they always achieve good results. For example, Pounds 100,000
was paid at Antiquorum's April sale for a 1902 watch by Charles Frodsham of
London. This 18-carat gold model was a minute-repeating, keyless pocket
chronometer with one-minute tourbillon and seconds split chronograph with
60-minute recorder.
Humbler hunter and half-hunter cased pocket watches still represent great
value at auction, selling for little more than the gold value of their
cases. Anything of this type with a reliable movement should be desirable.
Antique clocks are a quieter market than 18 months ago, but the change of
emphasis is in the speed of sales rather than price. Dealers report that
interest has held up, but that each sale takes much longer to complete after
the initial enquiry.
Prices at auction are stable and, for some types of I8th and 19th century
clocks, are even ahead of the supposed peak of the market late in 1989. But
one investor, perhaps reflecting the view of many others, expressed surprise
recently at the very reasonable price level of antique clocks; he said it
was well below what it would cost to make an equivalent today. Of course, a
newly-made clock can never have the same appeal as an antique which has
stood the test of time in terms of design and mechanism while attaining a
pleasing patina of age.
These days, good style is much more important for buyers than the narrow
historical band of 1680-1720 clocks upon which collectors concentrated in
the 1950s, '60s and '70s. In this context, verge escapement clocks used to
be the only ones considered; now, anchor escapement clocks of the Regency
and Victorian periods no longer suffer from the snobbery of the past. A
Regency chamfer top bracket clock of good colour and proportions can make
just as much as a mid-Georgian verge bracket clock.
It is on these lines that Garrard, the Crown jeweller, is organising its
exhibition, Master Clockmakers: the Golden Age of English Horology 1680-1900
(May 18-30), with exhibits both on loan and for sale. The exhibition
emphasises the essential quality of English antique clocks (regardless of
the importance of the maker) as was required by the regulations of the
Worshipful Company of Clockmakers when it was set up in the 17th century in
the City of London. Prices range from Pounds l,800, for a Victorian rosewood
bracket clock, to more than Pounds 1m.
Clocks by Tompion, Quare and Knibb and the other British 'greats' also are
carried by Woodburn, near Tonbridge, Kent. These include a longcase clock by
Gray and Vulliamy which makes an interesting comparison with one by the same
maker at the Garrard exhibition. Meanwhile, Asprey, which deals also in
continental clocks, is planning to show at the Grosvenor House antique fair
a very grand ormolu-mounted empire period clock by Breguet which is very
similar to one in the Queen's collection at Buckingham Palace.
Bracket and longcase clocks are the staple of the English market. Bracket
clocks are comparatively simple to set up at home, so long as they are on a
level surface, but longcase clocks present greater problems. Once bought,
there are the difficulties of getting the case to stand level and, having
set up the movement in the case, getting the pendulum to swing evenly in
beat. There is also the question of deciding if the movement and the case
really belong together and if they require any restorative work.
An auction usually will be the cheapest way of acquiring a longcase clock -
providing you feel competent to assess what is on offer and cope with any
work needed. If you are in any doubt, always ask the auctioneer for his
opinion.
A dealer, on the other hand, will offer fully-restored clocks in working
order and with a guarantee of authenticity, for he is bound by the Trades
Description Act. A working relationship with a respectable dealer can pay
dividends, and he should be prepared always to buy back his old stock if
your circumstances change.
You can acquire a respectable, but not outstanding, long-case clock for up
to Pounds 2,000 at auction, although you should reckon on having to spend at
least a quarter of that again to put it into good order. But this is the
lower end of the market; you can easily spend into five figures both at
auction and at a dealer. Indeed, the more expensive the type of clock, the
closer the prices at the saleroom and the dealer's. This, potentially, makes
a fully-restored and guaranteed clock from a dealer very good value.

   Four American scientists reacted with delight Thursday at being
named Nobel Prize winners for their work in physics and chemistry,
and one said it was time to ``go back to the lab and do more work.''
   The physics award was given to Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard
University for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic
clock, and to Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington and
Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for a method to isolate single atoms
and make exacting measurements of them.
   The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech, 41, of
the University of Colorado, and Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale
University. They showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s
that RNA, then thought to be merely a genetic messenger inside the
cell, could rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions.
   Half the physics prize will go to Ramsey, 74. The other half
will be shared by the German-born Dehmelt, 67, of the University of
Washington in Seattle, and Paul, 76, of the University of Bonn.
Each Nobel Prize is worth $469,000.
   ``I am obviously excited about it,'' said Cech, who was visiting
Boston to receive a prize for genetic work from Massachusetts
General Hospital. ``It was something that everybody has been
telling me would happen, but I had no way of knowing when.''
   While Nobel Prize celebrations may be relatively common in the
Boston area, Cech pointed out they are rarer elsewhere.
   ``My main emotion is that this is a great thing for the
University of Colorado and the state of Colorado,'' he said. ``This
is not the sort of thing that happens annually in the mountains the
way it does in Boston. That gives me a really good feeling.''
   Asked about his plans for the money, he said: ``I have two young
daughters who are very good at spending money.''
   Dehmelt said he didn't mind being awakened at 4 a.m. by a caller
from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to be told of the award.
   ``I'm elated,'' Dehmelt said from his Seattle apartment
overlooking Lake Washington. The prize and its prestige should make
his work easier, he said.
   One of the applications of his research is to make an atomic
clock thousands of times more accurate than any before.
   ``The clocks are very universally useful. They can be used in
navigation and missiles, and of course the military loves them.
They didn't give me any money, though,'' Dehmelt said.
   Ramsey said he was ``pleased and delighted and surprised'' to
learn he was awarded half the prize for inventing a precise method
for measuring time, by measuring the frequency of radiation from
atoms.
   ``Basically, I'm interested in all the laws of nature,'' said
Ramsey, who attributed his long interest in science to the fact
that ``it's fun.''
   Ramsey said he may use his prize money to defray the cost of
traveling to Grenoble, France, where he conducts research. But he
mentioned his wife would like him to buy a new car.
   Altman, at a news conference in New Haven, Conn., thanked U.S.
taxpayers, who he said provided the funds that the government
appropriated for research. The native of Canada held up a Yale
pennant that contained a small replica of the Canadian flag.
   ``I'll just go back to the lab and do more work,'' he said.
``And just try to understand the things I'm trying to understand.''
   Altman, a member of the Yale faculty since 1971, is now a
professor of biology. He was dean of Yale College from July 1986
through June 1989.

FT  23 OCT 93 / As they say in Europe: British time, gentlemen, please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE area where the British seem prepared to sell out to 'Europe' is the
one where there is no external pressure for them to do so. Tonight, the
clocks go back in Britain, returning it to the lap of Greenwich Mean Time.
There are, however, many voices demanding that daylight saving time should
become standard time despite the failure of an experiment on those lines 25
years ago.
Last weekend, the Mail on Sunday ran a poll which, it said, showed that 'a
clear majority favours keeping our time in line with Europe, which has
summer time the year round.' So, we are reminded of those long, balmy
January evenings in Hamburg where the sun does not set until about 1600
hours while poor Londoners have to put up with it disappearing at 4 pm.
The Mail's dream of permanent summer time is not the only argument deployed
in favour of 'moving an hour ahead.' There is the usual dreary thesis about
'giving a boost to tourism' - code for a vested interest wanting more of my
money.
Then, there are the Policy Studies Institute and something called Daylight
Extra, which say more than 100 lives would be saved by the change. But the
number killed on British roads actually rose, compared with the previous
three-year period, during the last experiment with continental time in
1969-71. Road deaths started to fall soon after GMT was restored and have
dropped steadily ever since.
And, finally, there is the argument of the Confederation of British
Industry: its members need frantic commercial intercourse with their
continental counterparts for eight hours a day. Seven are not enough. The
Japanese are seven hours ahead of Europe and 11 from the Atlantic coast of
North America; we all know of the failure of their commercial forays in
those areas.
When time zones first were agreed, Greenwich was fixed as the mid-point of
its zone, which meant that its eastern border was on the river Rhine. But
the French today are on central European time because of a last act of
collaboration. The Germans imposed l'heure allemande during the second world
war occupation and the French failed to change back when they left.
As a result, the morning rush hour in Paris is even more hellish than usual.
In December, darkness reigns until well after the offices fill and shadowy
figures in bars fortify themselves with extra glasses of cognac before they
are steeled for the so-called day. Road deaths are twice the level of
London. What it is like on the western edge of Brittany, I can only imagine.
The pressure to move the clock forward reflects the familiar vanity that
reality is ours to change. But the earth turns on its axis, and Belfast is
in a different time zone from Belgrade because it is in a different place.
If Britain were to change, would the republic of Ireland, on the western
edge of GMT, also change? If not (and why should it?), there would be a
north-south time zone across the island, so that the Londonderry sun would
not rise until nearly 11. But perhaps the north would stay with the
republic, thereby creating two time zones within the United Kingdom - and
handing a propaganda victory to the IRA.
The clock jugglers reflect a traditional British belief that fundamental
improvements can be gained through apparently painless institutional change.
A poll tax can distribute the cost of local government fairly; summer time
can be achieved by sleight-of-clock hand.
One hour saves a hundred lives. So, why not move forward two hours and save
200? Then, move a mere three hours more to Pakistan time: the dead would
doubtless rise from their graves, it would never get dark until nine in the
evening, and tourism would flourish.
There remains a rule which, however, has stood me in good stead on my
travels over the years. The sun rises in Berlin one hour before it is seen
in London. Yet, strangely, there is no organisation like Daylight Extra in
Berlin. No German minister is plagued with calls to move the clock forward
so as to cut the accident rate, reduce energy costs and achieve 'summer time
all year round just like they have in Lithuania.'
Think, though, what would happen if the Germans indulged in such fads.
Suppose Britain were to move an hour ahead and the Germans did the same at
the behest of Tageslicht Extra. The Confederation of British Industry would
then demand that Britain move again - just 'to keep up with the continent.'
When the Baltic states regained their independence, their first act was to
move their clocks one hour back from Moscow time. Single time zones across
huge areas are totalitarian phenomena - the Nazis imposed them, China has
them today. The diverse European Community covers three time zones. But one
of London's greatest strengths is that it is not anywhere else - so let us
not pretend it is.

<HL> London's System Did Well in Crash, Central Bank Says </HL>

   London's trading system coped with the October crash in world stock prices reasonably well, and the impact on the British economy so far seems to be modest, the Bank of England said. 

   The bank's report notes that the London market appears to have handled some pressures brought on by the crash better than New York. 

   In particular, it says, the capital available immediately to market-makers in London allowed them in the early stages of the crash to absorb substantial amounts of stock, while in New York a shortage of capital resources led to pressure on the so-called specialist firms that ordinarily intervene to keep markets in individual shares orderly. 
A report by London's stock exchange, issued Wednesday, made similar observations and said the London system "coped remarkably well." 

   An analysis published in the central bank's quarterly bulletin suggests that the world financial system as a whole responded well to the crash, though it qualifies its assessment as "tentative." 

   "On the evidence to date, the overall judgment must be that the international financial structure survived the shock at least passably well," the bank says in the report. 
This judgment was based largely on the facts that the crash produced "no major insolvencies," and that most markets, for all but relatively short periods, remained open. 

   Separately, the Bank of England bulletin says that the stronger than expected economic activity in the seven major industrial countries seen before the October crash has for the most part "been maintained." 

   The bank's report, like its stock exchange counterpart, stops well short of issuing any recommendations for modifying stock market trading practices in London or elsewhere around the world. 

   It does, however, highlight five areas of concern: the experience of the retail investor during the crash; the assessment of risks and capital adequacy for market participants; the role of the London stock exchange account; the interaction between options, futures and underlying markets; and the potential for rules limiting the speed at which prices move. 

   The stock exchange report said market participants should be encouraged to use arbitrage and hedging techniques to help prevent a repeat of the crash. 

   The Bank of England report gives tentative support to this view, saying that "in theory arbitrage activity should limit or modify" gaps between futures and cash stock prices created by volatile markets. 

   It goes on to say that halting trading at times of market volatility could "cause distortions" in both futures and cash markets that would curtail the balancing influence of arbitrage mechanisms. 

   While giving mild praise to the London trading system, the bank report also notes four potential problems brought out by the crash:
   --Rapid price changes that on several occasions led market-makers to trade at prices differing from those shown on market screens. 

   --An increase in spreads between the bid and offer prices made by market-makers. 

   --Reductions in the size of the lots in which market-makers were prepared to trade. 

   --Delays by some market-makers in answering phones.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (4): Clocks begin to
tick - Demand is rising and bargains getting fewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past year or so has seen time hang heavily on the auction trade in
clocks; move more briskly for some watches; and positively buzz along for
jewels. But there are signs that the era of low, indeed bargain, prices for
higher quality antique clocks in the saleroom might be about to pass.
Demand has been brisker at recent auctions, and this should tempt on to the
market some of the good clocks which have been waiting for the higher prices
to return.
Many people like the idea of owning an antique clock, an impressive 18th
century longcase ticking away in their hall, but are deterred by their
ignorance and fears about the condition and conservation of such mature
specimens. They need not worry. At its last auction, Sotheby's offered 41
longcase clocks dating from the 1720s to 1900 and sold all but one at prices
ranging from Pounds 800 to Pounds 10,000.
A decent Georgian clock can be acquired in the saleroom for under Pounds
2,000. A restorer might charge Pounds 350 to put the mechanism in working
order and repairs might also be needed to the case. But, for less than
Pounds 3,500, you can have an attractive working antique.
Of course the big names - Tompions, Knibbs, Grahams and Delander - cost much
more. Any serious - and rich - collector of antiques should have a clock by
the father of British clockmaking, Thomas Tompion, on their buying list. His
appeal is international. Working in the late 17th and early 18th centuries
he commands a premium over all other makers.
In 1989, a rare blonde wood Tompion sold for Pounds 880,000. This was at the
peak of the antiques market but even in the doldrums of last June Christie's
offered some Tompions and they all made good prices, with a tiny, 6 1/3 in
high, silver mounted ebony bracket clock, probably made for King William
III, selling for Pounds 441,500, and a table clock for Pounds 298,500.
Since then, no important clock has appeared at auction, and the sluggish
demand of recent years has made a simple clock by Tompion (almost)
affordable.
No Tompions are on offer at the important June auctions in London, but a top
dealer such as R A Lee, (now part of Aspreys) could probably supply one for
less than Pounds 100,000 and a routine bracket clock by Tompion might be
acquired for as little as Pounds 40,000. Prices are low mainly because
dealers have run down their stocks and are unwilling to start buying again -
yet.
French clocks, with a wider range of collectors, are a slightly firmer
market, but a 19th century carriage clock can still be bought for Pounds
1,000. There is greater interest in the elaborate French Empire mantel
clocks, the more unusually decorative the better. Here prices have edged up
in the past year or so, but an excellent example should cost less than
Pounds 4,000.
There are many people who just cannot cope with the antique, with the
problems of maintenance. They want the finest craftsmanship, but they want
it to be contemporary.
There is at least one British clockmaker still working in the traditional
way, with virtually every component made in house. Sinclair Harding, of
Cheltenham, makes no more than 20 clocks a year and, at the Basle fair
introduced a new model, a skeleton sun and moon clock, plated in gold and
priced at around Pounds 8,000.
Watches have become the great fashion accessory, a palpable sign of wealth
and taste. They are now traded regularly in the salerooms, a service to
sellers who want to cash in expensive watches that might seem, to them,
dated: or they might have been given a newer model. You can acquire a recent
Breguet, Rolex, Cartier, Audemars Piguet or Patek Phillipe watch for perhaps
half its retail value. An older watch would be even cheaper.
A good solid pocket watch, a hunter, made in the late 19th century by the
celebrated Charles Frodsham, can still be bought for less than Pounds 4,000,
and will prove a reliable friend and an agreeable heirloom.
In the past year, jewels have become second only to Impressionist and modern
art as a money spinner for Sotheby's and Christie's. In 1993 Sotheby's
brought in Dollars 475m from jewels sales and Christie's Dollars 358m. In
1970 jewels were an insignificant sector.
The great majority of the trade is in stones, mainly diamonds, with a few
rich dealers, especially the Saudi Arabian Sheikh Ahmed Fitaihi, buying the
most expensive stones, including the Dollars 11.88m he paid for a 100-carat
diamond at Sotheby's in November.
Most of the buyers are Arabs, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans, and
there is an undoubted investment element behind the competition of the last
two years.
But high prices for stones has a knock-on effect on jewellery. Salerooms
have done their best to promote their involvement, stressing that as well as
glitzy events at Geneva and St Moritz they also hold auctions, such as the
evening 'Colonnade' events at Sotheby's, the sales at Christie's South
Kensington, Phillips and Bonhams, where lots usually sell for Pounds 2,000
or less.
More private buyers are daring to take on the dealers in the saleroom and
are acquiring jewellery, from 19th century to contemporary, at modest
expense.
Although the auction houses offer clocks, watches and jewels at wholesale
prices many people still prefer to collect with a dealer holding their hand.
Good dealers are keen to offer impartial advice; they guarantee the
authenticity and condition of the goods, which is so important with antique
clocks; and they will often agree to buy them back.
A specialist clock dealer, such as Anthony Woodburn, of Tunbridge Wells,
Kent, also often has its own sources of supply, and can offer a year-round
service.
While English furniture has generally ridden out the recession well, clocks
have remained in their specialist ghetto. Why people keen to acquire 18th
and 19th century tables and chairs, dressers and desks, should baulk at
buying an antique clock is not clear. Perhaps their sheer size counts
against substantial late 19th century longcase (grandfather) clocks, but
bracket clocks, carriage clocks, mantel clocks and lantern clocks and
chronometers provide charm and utility.
It is probably the mystery of the inner workings that deters potential
collectors. But there has never been a better time to acquire an antique
clock, either in the euphoria of the auction house, or after careful
consultation with a dealer.

<TEXT>
   A century-old clock in this
quintessential New England town has pitted old-timers fond of its
hourly chiming against a pair of newcomers who say the clamor is
taking a toll on their sleep.
   The couple sued to silence the town clock at night, and that is
the talk of the Main Street barbershop, just a stone's throw from
the First Congregational Church steeple that holds the clock, said
barber Giles Desmond.
   ``Any time anything happens that might undermine the town's
history, people get very _ how shall I say? _ hostile,'' said
Selectman George G. Zgrodnik Jr. ``What do you think people in
England would do if they turned off Big Ben?''
   This confrontation of yuppies vs. Yankees has caused the
greatest bustle in the pretty little town since an old school was
demolished a decade ago to make way for a modern one, said Zgrodnik.
   Feelings run deep in this 319-year-old farming community, where
settlers once battled Indians and asparagus has overtaken tobacco
as the chief cash crop. Zgrodnik said some of the 3,200 townspeople
still aren't talking to the official they suspect of arranging the
schoolhouse demolition.
   Richard and Pamela Carnall moved into this community of strong
traditions in August and unsuspectingly bought a 19th-century house
50 yards from the 1870 white clapboard church.
   The town clock was broken and silent until after they moved in.
   Mrs. Carnall said they endured the chimes when they first
resumed because they assumed the bell was tolling only for holidays.
   When the chiming continued, the couple offered to install a
timer to shut the bell off at night. Selectmen declined the offer,
saying the timer could jam the works of the delicate clock.
   The Carnalls say in their lawsuit that the bell has turned them
into crabby insomniacs, making them ``irritable, frustrated, angry,
humorless and combative.'' They claim it booms into their bedroom
at 75 decibels, louder than a vacuum cleaner.
   ``I told my husband when it started, `This is not normal, this
ringing around the clock,''' Mrs. Carnall, 29, a marketing
consultant, said Wednesday.
   She and her 34-year-old husband, a cable TV salesman, grew up in
nearby towns and were drawn to Hatfield for its traditional values
but were driven to sue out of desperation, she said.
   ``We just lost sleep night after night. We had no choice,'' she
said.
   She said she has received support from some townspeople,
including one particularly sympathetic note. ``It really meant a
lot, coming from an air traffic controller,'' she said.
   On the other side of the issue, a petition in Desmond's
Barbershop says the bell has ``been signaling farmers, children and
other residents of the hours longer than anyone remembers.''
   At least 200 signatures were gathered in the day before a March
24 hearing on a preliminary injunction that would have shut off the
bell at night until a trial could be held. A judge denied the
injunction, saying the Carnalls hadn't proved irreparable harm.
   Neighbors tell the Carnalls they will eventually get used to the
bell, as other families have in the 60 years since the house was
moved to the spot from a quarter-mile down the street.
   Other townsfolk say the selectmen have their backs up about the
recent influx of newcomers like the Carnalls and overreacted to the
request to quiet the bell at night.
   ``I'm surprised at the intensity of feeling a few people have
for that bell at one, two, three o'clock in the morning,'' said the
Carnalls' attorney, W. Michael Ryan, who also lives in town. ``The
general population of Hatfield thinks this is comical.''

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (7): At the tip of an iceberg - The
Fixings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 10.30 am and 3.00 pm every working day N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons hosts one
of the City of London's most select parties - the London gold fixing. It is
select but far from exclusive. The five members of the fixing committee
constitute the tip of an iceberg that incorporates virtually the whole of
the world gold market.
The five - representatives of Rothschild (traditionally chairman of the
fixing committee), Samuel Montagu, Mocatta and Goldsmid, Sharps Pixley and
Mase Westpac - are in constant contact with their dealing rooms, which are
in turn in touch with traders around the globe.
The fix begins with the chairman naming a price that he has chosen on the
basis of pre-fix trading activity. That is relayed through the dealers to
their customers, who respond with pledges to buy or sell at that price
certain quantities of good delivery bars of about 12.5 kg (worth about
Dollars 135,000 each).
These pledges are netted by the individual fix members who then announce if
they are sellers, in which case they specify the amount, or buyers, in which
case they do not state the size of their bids.
If there are no sellers the price is raised; if no buyers, it is lowered.
When both buyers and sellers are declared, the chairman asks for 'figures
please' and the volume of bids is announced.
If the bids outweigh the offers the price is raised, if the sellers are in
the majority it is lowered. The process continues until the price is found
that achieves equilibrium between bids and offers.
This is indicated by the miniature Union Jacks that are placed in front of
each committee member being laid on their sides, following which the
chairman cries 'fixed'.
However, there is no rush. Market conditions can change by the minute and
buyers and sellers can change their minds. Any committee member can halt the
proceedings by calling 'flag up' and raising his little Union Jack while he
consults with his trading room.
The whole process can sometimes be completed in minutes, but it has been
known to take two hours when the market is in a particularly excitable mood.
The fixing ritual, though venerable, is far from ancient. It dates from
Britain's abandonment of the gold standard during the First World War. Until
then the Bank of England stood ready to buy any amount of gold at Pounds
3.17.9d a troy ounce and to sell at Pounds 3.17.10 1/2 d. During the war the
bank bought all South Africa's gold output at Pounds 4.4.11d, but when
sterling was devalued against the US dollar in 1919 it was persuaded to
allow all South African gold, about half the world's output, to be sold by
N. M. Rothschild 'at the best price obtainable, giving the London market and
the bullion brokers a chance to bid'.
The first fixing took place, by telephone, on September 12 of that year and
the price was Pounds 4.18.9d, reflecting the higher grade being offered and
a premium on account of sterling's depreciation against the dollar.
For nearly 50 years - except during the attempt to reimpose a gold standard
for sterling in the period 1925-31 and from the start of the Second World
War till 1954 - the fixing thrived, principally as the outlet for South
African gold, with the Reserve Bank of South Africa using the Bank of
England as its selling agent.
The Bank of England operated on the re-opened market, as did other central
banks, to hold the price at Dollars 35 an ounce for reasons of monetary
policy. This was in accordance with President Roosevelt's 1934 decision,
confirmed by the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. As upward price pressure
built up the London Gold Pool was formed in 1961, with the Bank of England
acting on behalf of Britain, the US, Belgium, France, Italy the Netherlands,
Switzerland and West Germany to maintain that price.
However, pressure continued to build up, with Soviet gold sales drying up,
sterling under pressure and the US suffering from balance of payments
difficulties as well as the Vietnam War. Despairing attempts to hold the
line after sterling's 1967 devaluation were finally abandoned on March 15,
1968 when Mr Roy Jenkins, the Labour chancellor of the exchequer, announced
that the gold market had been closed 'at the request of the US'.
When the London gold market opened its doors again two weeks later it was on
a world that was scarcely recognisable, and the role of the fixing had
changed for ever.
South Africa had switched much of its business to a new pool of Swiss banks
operating through the Zurich market and a two-tier market had been
established. Central banks traded among themselves at the official Dollars
35 price and other business - for speculators, hoarders, jewellery and other
industrial users - was conducted in a free market.
'That year really was the watershed in London's history,' said Timothy Green
in his book The New World of Gold. 'The story really does divide before and
after 1968. As one dealer put it, 'We used to be a distribution centre for
South African and other people's gold; now it is a market place, a trading
forum'.'
Throwing complacency to the wind, the London market introduced the second
fixing at 3 pm and started to fix the price in dollars; both moves being
designed to attract US market operators.
Since then the London fixing has become as important an institution in the
new, investor-based market as it was when central banks ruled the roost. The
price levels it sets apply to a relatively small amount of the business done
in a round-the-clock market. But they are valuable snapshots (sometimes
time-exposures) of the state of the market and investors know that the
fixing price results from the matching of a substantial volume of business.
For this reason producer sales are often tied to the fixing price and many
central banks use a fixing average in revaluing their gold holdings.
The actual amount of business done at the fixings remains a secret, though
some traders feel that, in the interest of market transparency, daily volume
figures should be published.
Prominent among these is Mr Robert Guy, who recently stepped down as
chairman of the London Bullion Market Association. But others argue that
such information would be meaningless as fixing volume represents only the
sum of the unmatched business of myriad individual traders and would give
little idea of the true extent of the business covered by the fixing price.
For the time being, therefore, it seems likely that the market will retain
some of its mystery and that the stock response to a query on the level of
turnover will continue to be 'oh, several tons'.

It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that stopped the clock in the Big Ben 
bell tower three times this week, the government said today.

<P>
The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of Parliament stopped 
at 5:11 a.m. today, which is about where they snagged Wednesday and Thursday.

"We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this morning, that the 
problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern face of the clock, and that once 
that bearing has been replaced or lubricated, that the problem will go away," 
said Toby Sargent, spokesman for the Department of Environment.

Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock broke down 
during the hottest days of the London summer. On Thursday, the temperature

FT  12 FEB 94 / How Rothschild saved the City from collapse: David Kynaston
tells the story of a 19th-century crisis that almost destroyed London as a
financial centre and irrevocably changed the banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID KYNASTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday - that dreadful Saturday l shall never forget - the run
increased to a frightful degree, everybody came in to take out their
balance, no-one brought any money in. One old steady customer, who had
usually Pounds 30,000 there, drew it out without, as is usual, giving any
warning, and in order to pay it the House was left literally empty. Henry
went out to endeavour to borrow but people made shuffling excuses. Old Scott
cried like a child of five years old . . .
That unforgettably dreadful Saturday was December 3 1825. The hysterical
partners all belonged to the private banking firm of Pole, Thornton, Free,
Down &amp; Scott, and the City of London was in turmoil.
It was the worst crisis since the South Sea Bubble of 1720, when hugely
inflated schemes of trade in the Pacific and elsewhere had ended in tears
and acrimony. There had been several other crises since, but none so
threatening to the whole financial and commercial edifice. Everyone knew the
cause, few the remedy.
From the early 1820s the City had been in a state of headlong, uncontrolled,
irrational bullishness - the first of the great 19th-century booms following
the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.
As anyone who has been anxiously watching the market in recent weeks will
understand, stocks can go bounding upwards so long as everyone is confident
that they will continue to rise, but as soon as people begin to lose their
nerve, the whole house of cards can collapse. Even in modern regulated
markets the psychological fundamentals are the same as in the great crisis
of 1825.
In those days, the banking system also depended crucially on confidence,
partly because its capital reserves were inadequate and completely
unpoliced. Protection for investors was minimal; the private sector Bank of
England, little more than a century old, was still groping uncertainly
towards modern notions of central banking; and a host of new entrants from
the continent was flocking into the City to take advantage of London's new
position as the world's dominant financial centre. The square mile was at
this time no place for faint hearts.
One of its specialities was grossly overpriced loans to the newly liberated
countries of Latin America. But at least Colombia, Chile and Peru were all
real places - unlike Poyais, an imaginary country reputedly somewhere in
central America for which bonds were successfully issued.
By late 1825, the bubble in foreign loans and company promotions had burst,
hastened by speculative over-trading in imported commodities, rashness on
the part of the country banks, and a Bank of England policy that veered
between complacency and an over-sharp contraction of credit.
'There will be a general crash,' the Duke of Wellington, who became Tory
prime minister from 1828 to 1830, had predicted in March. He took a grim
satisfaction as events unfolded.
Keeping his head while all around lost theirs, was 28-year-old Henry
Thornton. His sister, Marianne, recorded the events of that terrible day:
'They shut up always at five. At four, he ordered the balance for the day to
be struck, and found that during the next hour they would have to pay Pounds
33,000, and they should receive only Pounds 12,000. This was certain
destruction and he walked out determined to try one last resource.'
He went to a fierce rival, the banking house of Smith, Payne &amp; Smiths and
threw himself at the mercy of John Smith. He said that he could hardly
expect him to lend him money, but if he could get them through until five,
it would be 'an inexpressible relief'. Smith asked if he could give his word
of honour that Pole, Thornton, Free, Down &amp; Scott was solvent. Henry gave
it.
'Well,' continued Marianne, 'then he said they should have everything they
could spare, which was not quite enough tho', for they had been hard-pressed
themselves that day, but he went back with Henry to watch the event. Two
people had chanced to pay in some money whilst Henry had been absent. This,
with what he had borrowed, exactly met the demand upon them. But never, he
says, shall he forget watching the clock to see when five would strike, and
end their immediate terror - or whether any one would come in for any more
payments. The clock did strike at last, and they were safe for the moment .
. .'
Thornton's bank might just have pulled through, but on Thursday, December 8,
news came that Wentworth &amp; Co, a leading Yorkshire bank had failed, owing
Pole's a vital sum which could not be repaid.
Hudson Gurney, the Quaker banker, expressed the fear that gripped the
country that day: 'Who may be able to stand on a general shrinkage nobody
can well foresee.' Adding: 'I have been run to death, apparently doing
nothing, but am utterly bothered in mind and spirit.' Charles Churchill, the
timber broker, declared in his diary on the Saturday: 'The distress for
Money among respectable Dealers &amp; Merchants is beyond anything ever
experienced.'
A tidal run on the country banks was beginning and Henry Thornton was
convinced that there was no alternative but for his bank to stop payment.
'If he had borrowed more money,' Marianne explained, 'it would have only
been to lend to Country Banks, who might all have stopped tomorrow'.
Henry took his decision calmly enough, bringing down over three dozen
country banks. But when he told the City on Monday morning, the reaction was
frenetic.
'The dense fog which prevailed throughout the day was scarcely more gloomy
than the countenances of those who are affected by the present alarming
state of the Money Market,' the Morning Chronicle reported. Tuesday was no
better, as news came that Williams &amp; Co, of Birchin Lane, was in trouble. An
impassable crowd gathered outside that particular banking house. 'Never were
such times,' cried many of the oldest visitors of the exchange, while others
exclaimed: 'If this state of things continues, we must ask not who is gone,
but who stands? For unless something is done to relieve the pressure, and to
restore confidence, few can resist so overwhelming a torrent of distrust.'
On Wednesday, panic mounted and: 'The Royal Exchange was thronged long
before the customary hour of assemblage, and Cornhill, Lombard-street,
Nicholas-lane, and all the streets in which banking-houses are situated,
were crowded to such a degree, as to impede the progress of passengers.'
Police were called and 'kept up a constant cry of 'move on''. Gloom pervaded
the Stock Exchange, where 'in the Foreign Stocks all were on the decline,
and of Home Shares nothing was said except a hearty wish that they were all
in a very warm place'.
The only positive development of the day was a meeting at Mansion House of
about 100 merchants and bankers, who passed a resolution expressing
confidence in the Bank of England's attempts to stem the crisis.
Their confidence was, on the whole, justified. Since the start of the week
the Bank had been making every effort to bolster the market. A key moment
came on Thursday, when Lord Liverpool's Tory government reluctantly gave its
sanction to the Bank issuing Pounds 1 notes for the first time since
Britain's return to the gold standard four years earlier.
Yet by Friday, the situation was as grave as ever. Relations between
government and Bank were at best irascible and Frederick Robinson,
chancellor of the exchequer, was held in contempt by the City for
irresolution. Only one possible saviour was left. The City turned to an
outsider, a foreigner and a Jew, who was held in grudging respect for the
sharpness of his financial dealings.
Nathan Rothschild, one of the greatest financiers of all time, was the third
son of a Frankfurt merchant. He had been based in the City since 1808 and
was already acknowledged as its nonpareil figure. Having made a huge fortune
by conducting audacious bullion operations on behalf of the British
Government during the later stages of the Napoleonic Wars, this was Nathan's
chance to do something similarly striking in peacetime, to save the nation
from financial collapse and make a handsome turn at the same time.
By the end of that Friday he had managed to obtain from the continent up to
Pounds 300,000 in gold, replenishing the Bank of England's barren coffers.
In the era before the telegraph, this was an astonishing feat. Rothschild
had developed a sophisticated private courier and homing pigeon system,
which enabled him to communicate with his brothers in Paris, Frankfurt,
Vienna and Naples, all at the hub of international finance.
This extraordinary family, together with Barings, occupied a position
comparable to that of central banks or even the International Monetary Fund
today. In the rueful words of the brother of the Governor of the Bank of
England: 'The Rothschilds have become the metallic sovereigns of Europe . .
. They have obtained a control over the European exchanges, which no party
ever before could accomplish, and they now seem to hold the strings of the
public purse. No sovereign without their assistance now could raise a loan.'
It was in the full knowledge of Rothschild's efforts that the Iron Duke now
stood firm, telling Liverpool that 'while there was life there was hope'
that the Bank of England must not be allowed to go off the gold standard,
and instead 'the Government were bound to support them to the very utmost of
their power . . . for their interests were those of the country'.
During the next few days the tide turned, and by Christmas confidence had
been restored. Thornton even succeeded in landing a new post. Williams &amp; Co,
although it had stopped payment on the 13th, managed by the end of the year
to reconstitute itself as Williams, Deacon &amp; Co and brought in the
battle-hardened Henry as one of the new partners. There beckoned, for E M
Forster's great uncle, an illustrious career in banking.
It was a profession that was irrevocably changed by the 1825 crisis. A
series of inquiries began which laid the foundations for the modern banking
system. Inadequately capitalised private banks outside London took much of
the retrospective flak, and legislation was passed permitting the
establishment of joint-stock banks outside a radius of 65 miles from London.
Within a few years joint-stock banks, in addition to the Bank of England,
were allowed in London, beginning with the London and Westminster Bank (now
the NatWest) which opened for business in Throgmorton Street in 1834. The
other direct consequence of the crisis was that the Bank of England
tightened its control over the currency, setting up 11 provincial branches
in the late 1820s in order to promote wider use of its own notes.
After the crisis Thomas Love Peacock, poet, novelist and an official of the
East India Company, reflected on the crazy phenomenon in verse, which might
equally well have been an epitaph on the banking follies that caused the
Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s:
Oh] where are the riches that bubbled like fountains,
In places we neither could utter nor spell,
A thousand miles inland 'mid untrodden mountains,
Where silver and gold grew like heath and blue-bell?
Now curst be the projects, and curst the projectors,
And curst be the bubbles before us that rolled,
Which, bursting, have left us like desolate spectres,
Bewailing our bodies of paper and gold.

<HEAD>Newcomers Want Town Clock Silenced At Night</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Hearing starts 8 p.m. EST. Lead planned.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HATFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The clock in the Congregational Church has
sounded the hours, day and night, for most of two centuries. Now, a
couple new in town has asked selectmen to turn it off at night so
they can sleep.
   This little farming town of 3,000 people is not so sure it wants
to give up the tradition.
   Richard Carnall said Monday that he and his wife moved from
Northampton to a home next door to the church this summer while the
clock was broken and the chimes didn't sound.
   ``It's not just loud. At midnight it rings 12 times and at five
in the morning it rings five times,'' Carnall said. ``We're about 40
feet away and it's as loud as a car pulling into the driveway.''
   But Carnall said before a Monday night public hearing that he has
gotten mixed reactions to his proposal to silence the bells between
midnight and 6 a.m.
   ``Those bells have been ringing for about 200 years and I don't
think too many people want them changed,'' said Selectman Thomas
Hurley, adding that town officials got an earful from residents
during the months the bells didn't ring. Although the clock is in
the church, built in 1668, the town has been maintaining it for more
than a century.
   ``You get used to it,'' said Selectman George Zgrodnik Jr., who
has lived across the street from the clock for most of his 47 years.
For years, he said, it was the only way his father and other farmers
had of knowing the time when they were working in the fields.
   ``I remember my folks would tell me to be home at a certain time
and, like most kids, running like hell when I heard the clock in
hopes I'd get home before the chimes stopped,'' Zgrodnik said.
   ``It's sort of comforting to hear,'' said his wife, Marion.
   ``Most people in town that I've talked to feel its no different
from moving in next door to Big Ben in London and asking that it be
shut off at night. And they don't much like people coming in and
upsetting their applecart,'' Zgrodnik said. ``One fellow told me
that if we do agree to shut down the clock, we'd better be prepared
to move the town dump, because he doesn't like having that near his
house.''

<TEXT>
   Like clockwork, Big Ben's famous hands stopped for
the second day running Thursday at 5:20 p.m.
   This time, engineers were prepared. They quickly restarted the
hands manually on the four clock faces atop the 20-story tower
overlooking the Houses of Parliament.
   But engineers were still trying to figure out the reason for Big
Ben's fitful timekeeping.
   London's weather, a favorite complaint for natives, has been
unsually hot. Some residents suspect that to be the cause.
   On Wednesday, the clock stopped for about three hours before
workers brought it back to life.
   Big Ben is a 13{-ton bell that chimes out the hours from behind
the clock faces. Stoppages are rare for the 131-year-old clock
tower, which has survived pollution, bad weather and war.
   A plan to renovate the clock's hammer arm and chimes is expected
to be completed this month.

4 AMERICANS, GERMAN SHARE SCIENCE NOBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two American molecular biologists who revolutionized scientists' view of the 
nature of the first life on Earth won the Nobel Prize for chemistry on 
Thursday, while two Americans and a German physicist who developed new 
techniques for highly accurate timekeeping shared the physics Nobel. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado in Boulder and Sidney Altman of Yale 
University will share the $460,000 chemistry prize for their unexpected 
discovery that ribonucleic acid (RNA), which was originally thought only to be 
a repository of genetic information, can carry out biochemical functions as 
well. The discovery may make possible new ways to fight the common cold and 
other viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Ramsey of Harvard University will receive half the physics prize for his 
discovery of the atomic clock, which utilized the element cesium to make modern 
timekeeping possible and, in the process, helped develop a firm underpinning 
for relativity, one of the most esoteric theories in physics. 
</P>
<P>
Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington in Seattle and Wolfgang Paul of 
the University of Bonn in West Germany shared the other half for their 
development of techniques for trapping charged particles for long periods of 
time, which is expected to lead to the development of clocks that are many 
times more accurate than even the cesium clocks. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements completed a near-sweep of the science Nobels by U.S. 
researchers this year, continuing U.S. dominance of the prizes. On Monday, 
cancer researchers Harold E. Varmus and J. Michael Bishop of UC San Francisco 
were named winners of the medicine Nobel, making six of the seven recipients 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
All the new laureates expressed surprise and delight upon their early morning 
notification of the awards. "I would not say I expected it," Dehmelt said, "but 
I may have hoped or wished for it." 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that everyone has been telling me would happen," Cech said, 
"but I had no way of knowing when." 
</P>
<P>
At a morning celebratory party at Harvard, Ramsey poured champagne for two 
previous Harvard Nobel laureates and, before pouring his own glass, paused and 
said: "Well, my day is probably shot anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his plans for the prize money, Dehmelt said: "I will spend it." 
</P>
<P>
Cech, 41, and Altman, 50, helped evolutionary biologists attack an age-old 
puzzle that is often stated in terms of the riddle, "Which came first, the 
chicken or the egg?" In this case, the "egg" is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), 
the genetic blueprint that stores all the information from which organisms are 
constructed, while the "chickens" are proteins, which carry out all biochemical 
functions in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists reasoned that the first life on Earth had to have both genetic 
information and biochemical functions, implying that both DNA and proteins must 
have been present when the first life arose from the primordial ooze. But 
virtually everyone agrees that a system containing both DNA and proteins is too 
complex to have arisen spontaneously, leaving researchers at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Cech and Altman, working independently, solved the problem by focusing on RNA, 
which until that time had been considered only a simple messenger -- in effect, 
a set of working blueprints, copied from the master blueprint of DNA, that 
serve as a pattern for the construction of proteins. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Canadian-born Altman was studying an RNA-cutting protein from a 
bacterium when he found that RNA fragments were necessary for the activity of 
the protein. Altman himself had difficulty believing his results and even 
greater difficulty publishing them. Funding agencies were also highly skeptical 
about his claims. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1981, Cech, who received his doctorate from UC Berkeley, demonstrated 
that the cutting and splicing of RNA from a single-celled protozoan could be 
carried out in the absence of proteins. He and Altman subsequently showed that 
RNA could take the place of proteins called enzymes in carrying out many 
chemical reactions, opening a floodgate of new research on RNA. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers also believe that the concept of RNA enzymes will have even 
greater importance in the future because they might be used to destroy viruses 
or to remove the genetic information that makes them harmful, leading to new 
treatments for disease. 
</P>
<P>
Although not as old as the origin of life, the problem of keeping time has 
plagued humans for eons. From the beginning of time until 1967, timekeeping 
methods were based on the rotation of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In that year, the world switched to a newer form of timekeeping based on the 
oscillations of cesium atoms in a so-called atomic clock. That clock was 
largely the work of Ramsey, 74. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, Ramsey found a way to measure the frequency with which cesium 
atoms, flying through a cavity, switch between two electronically excited 
states. Since 1967, one second has been defined internationally as the time 
required for 9,192,631,770 such oscillations. 
</P>
<P>
The chief advantage of the atomic clock is that it is accurate to one second in 
300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Precise timekeeping is crucial in a variety of modern applications. In 
satellite-based navigation systems, for example, the time required for a radio 
signal to travel to a ship or plane from satellites can be used to determine 
position precisely, but only if the timekeeping is accurate. Deep space 
communications also require extremely stable frequencies such as those produced 
by atomic clocks. 
</P>
<P>
The new clocks have also been crucial in confirming Einstein's Theory of 
General Relativity, which predicts, among other things, that time passes faster 
when gravity is lower, but more slowly for objects traveling at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
But the differences are so small that high accuracy is required. In one 
experiment, for example, a cesium clock was carried in an airplane flying at 
30,000 feet for 15 hours. When the plane landed, the clock had gained about 45 
billionths of a second, confirming the theory. 
</P>
<P>
But the accuracy of atomic clocks is limited by the necessity of measuring the 
oscillations of the fast-moving cesium atoms, a problem akin to taking a clear 
photograph of a speeding bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Dehmelt, a naturalized citizen born in Germany, and Paul, 76, 
devised techniques for trapping single cesium ions (atoms from which an 
electron has been stripped away) or other charged particles in magnetic fields 
for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
Using these techniques, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology, the nation's official timekeeper, are now developing clocks that 
are 100,000 times as accurate as existing cesium clocks.

<TEXT>     A small, simple alarm clock is the sole judge in the "Joe's Pond
Association 1991 Ice-out Skill Game: Fourth Annual Electronically Controlled
Guessing Game.";    More than 2,100 tickets have been sold, at $1 each, with
every ticket providing its buyer with one guess about the hour and day the ice
will melt on Joe's Pond. The informal homeowners association will use its
share of the take to buy Fourth of July fireworks.;    Local legend holds that
the pond was named for Indian Joe, who got in trouble with his native Abenaki
tribe and fled south from Canada after siding with the British in the French
and Indian War. He lived out his days on an island in the pond and died in
1819.;    The wager started in 1980 when Chatot, Walter Ruf and Homer Fitts
first began betting on when the ice would disappear from the 400-acre pond
nestled in north-central Vermont.;    It was an informal thing, with guesses
written down in a notebook Chatot carried in his shirt pocket.;    Of course,
it wasn't always easy to agree which day should be declared "Ice-out Day.";   
"Homer and I would decide," said Chatot, who has summered on the lake for 20
years. "We'd argue a bit. I'd say 'The ice is out' and he'd say 'No, it's
not.' ";    The solution: an electric clock on Fitts' deck. The electric cord
powering the clock is run from a wall outlet to a concrete block placed on the
ice, then back to the clock.;    Once the block shifts because the ice has
melted, it stretches the wire and pulls the plug, stopping the clock.;    It
isn't just the people who live in the 268 camps around Joe's Pond who purchase
tickets. Ticket buyers this year are scattered around the world.;    "You can
tell the guesses from California," said Dave Caplan, a year-round Joe's Pond
resident who's wagered on four guesses this year. "They're the ones who say
January.";    No one remembers the ice ever melting before April 17.  </TEXT>

   It's life in the fast lane for a road
crew given 24 days to complete a repaving project that usually would
take more than three months.
   About 75 workers hopped on bulldozers Monday along the seven-mile
stretch of Interstate 96 west of Grand Rapids after state Department
of Transportation officials fired a starting pistol and waved an
orange construction flag, DOT spokeswoman Janet Foren said.
   ``They really started moving when that gun went off,'' Foren said.
   Cold cash might have accounted for the hot start.
   The state will pay the chief contractor, Thompson-McCully Co. of
Belleville, $500 for each hour by which the company beats the 24-day
_ or 576-hour _ deadline. But if the company misses the deadline, it
will be fined $500 for each additional hour needed, Foren said.
   Road crews will work from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. six or seven days
a week to complete the $1.4 million project, Foren said. They
usually work from about 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. five days a week.
   Motorists can monitor the progress of the project by watching two
huge clocks at either end of the construction site that will count
down the 24 days.
   Foren said the clock will stop only when it rains.
   Unlike baseball, however, no full rain days will be allowed _
when the raindrops stop, the clock starts ticking.

   Bill Reasor doesn't shoulder 50-pound
blocks of ice anymore, but handling a pair of 20-pound bags is still
pretty good for a 91-year-old man.
   Reasor has operated an ice delivery business for 40 years, and he
has no intention of stopping.
   ``I'm never going to give this up until the day I die,'' he says.
``It gets me out of bed in the morning.''
   Reasor delivers for weddings, family reunions, restaurants and
club gatherings, bringing ice to people who identify him only by
what he does.
   ``People don't know my name,'' he said recently. ``They just call
me the ice man.''
   Demand always has been steady.
   He once delivered 2,000 pounds of ice a day. Now, he gives
heavier orders to his son, Kevin.
   But he still does his share.
   ``It's exercise,'' he said. ``Some fellows like to play baseball
or play tennis. It's a nice clean, cool job.''

A clock restorer has presented the city with a surprise gift: He fixed an 
antique clock in the downtown area that has been stuck at 9 o'clock for more 
than 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents, merchants and visitors to Laguna deserved the time," said Brice 
Woodward of Laguna Beach, who restores wristwatches and clocks. So on Sunday he 
and two friends, Pat and Peter Becker of Costa Mesa, erected scaffolding near 
Forest Avenue and Glenneyre Street and spent about 7 hours installing parts, 
rewiring and cleaning the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Kenney recently received council approval to have the clock 
repaired but money had not been appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice civic gesture, and I appreciate all they have done," Kenney 
said. Woodward said he was "not interested in being compensated for the job." 
</P>
<P>
The clock has been in Laguna since the mid-1970s, when a merchant bought it 
from another merchant in Orange. That city, however, claimed that it and not 
the merchant owned the clock. To bypass the red tape, a small posse snatched 
the clock and bolted it to a pedestal with a concrete base in Laguna Beach, "to 
make sure nobody borrowed it," said Mike Eggers, one of the raiders and now a 
Dana Point council member.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: OFT talks halt TV bid clock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the future of London Weekend Television may not now be
resolved until the beginning of March, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Yesterday should have seen Granada's final extension of its offer of six new
shares for five LWT shares but talks were continuing with the Office of Fair
Trading with the takeover clock stopped.
The OFT is exploring with all parties involved what the future shape of
advertising sales houses, owned or influenced by Granada or LWT, should be.
Granada owns a 50 per cent stake in The Time Exchange which sells airtime
for Granada, Scottish, Border and Ulster. LWT owns Laser which sells airtime
for LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
If the two were combined it would amount to a 40 per cent share of the
market.
It may be as late as February 10 before the issue is resolved between the
OFT and the Department of Trade and Industry and the takeover clock starts
ticking.
Once the clock is started again LWT will have two days to put out any new
information and then the final closing date would follow 21 days after that.

<LEADPARA>  MOST families have their treasures: the quilt Grandma so lovingly stitched by
hand, square by square; the mantel clock that has passed from generation to
generation; the silver picture frame that once belonged to a favorite aunt.;  
 These treasures often come into our lives to mark special events: births,
graduations, weddings.  </LEADPARA>

QUALITY KEEPSAKES NEEDN'T BE OLD. YOU CAN
ACQUIRE TODAY WHAT WILL BE TOMORROW'S TREASURE  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     But more and more, people are not waiting for a special event to acquire a
precious keepsake. Whether it is a new piece of art glass or an antique rug,
people are searching for objects that will become tomorrow's heirlooms.;   
Quality is an overriding concern. Good design is equally important. And for
most, the object must radiate a certain warmth.;    "The '90s are very much
family oriented," says Barbara Tober, editor in chief of Bride's magazine.
"The gloss, the glitz is not what people are interested in. They want a homey
quality, even if it has to be instant, like finding monogrammed linens in a
thrift shop.";    There are several reasons for the new popularity of
heirlooms, including a greater appreciation of our own histories. "Brides are
older today," says Tober. "They realize the intrinsic value of things that
belonged to their grandmother, which might not have interested them as
teen-agers. They begin to realize the value of objects with longevity and
heritage.";    The transient nature of our society is also a factor, says Phil
Miller, vice president of the Howard Miller Co., which has manufactured
grandfather and other clocks since 1926. "Many objects are disposable: clothes
and even homes, which we may change as our lifestyles do.;    "But heirlooms
are transportable. And above all, they must have the ability to pull to the
heart, to draw some emotional response.";    Avoid antiques, try artisans;   
In searching for a piece with heirloom potential, you can go the traditional
route through antique dealers or, if budget is a factor, thrift shops. But
today, a host of artisans are at work crafting some exciting alternatives.;   
(box)  Silver. Historically, among the most popular heirlooms is a family's
silver. Some parents begin to collect silver pieces for their daughters when
they're born.;    Contemporary silversmith David Bacharach has expanded the
choices far beyond the standard place setting or pie server, offering works of
art to display year-round. Bacharach is a former dentist who hand-forges
exquisite serving pieces of etched brass and silver that command a place on
top of, not in, the sideboard.;    (box)  Art glass. Fine glassware has long
been a popular collectible. But there is a more affordable option than
crystal: art glass, which is crafted by glass artisans, one of the strongest
contingents of the American crafts movement.;    The selection of new art
glass includes stunning large decorative plates and bowls, and functional
pieces such as water and wine goblets, vases, paperweights and perfume
bottles.;    Glass provides homey feeling;    "Everyone wants to make a
personal expression about his home and environment," says Ann Corcoran, who
specializes in free-blown glass -- glass made without molds -- at Nourot Glass
Studio in Benicia.;    "In a time where much is keypunched and computerized,
through art glass you can get a glimmer of what it's like to create from
scratch, and of past eras when everything was done by hand. Pick up a piece of
purple glass and hold it to the light.";    (box)  Furniture. Perhaps no other
dealer in new home furnishings captures the concept of
furniture-as-potential-heirloom better than Ralph Lauren. His designs are
classic but often have a fresh twist: a floral teapot that is trimmed in
plaid; a chair seat upholstered in wool plaid with a needlepoint back; a
settee with a hand-painted leather back and a plaid seat.;    Besides having a
timeless style, these pieces are built to last. They are clearly intended to
be tomorrow's heirlooms.;    (box)  Clocks. Some heirlooms speak to you
directly. "Clocks are among the few possessions that take on a personality,"
says Phil Miller. "They almost become human. They can move and talk every 15
minutes. There's a personal involvement with them; you need to wind them once
a week, and for some that even becomes a tradition to pass on to the eldest
child.";    Not all of us have the room or budget for a grandfather clock. But
there are plenty of handsome alternatives. Howard Miller clocks range from
$600 to $10,000, the most expensive bearing elegant etched dials of brass,
pewter or silver plating. The signature series includes a solid brass plate
engraved with the purchaser's name and date acquired.;    (box)  Quilts.
"Quilts are probably the purest form of American folk art," says Judi Boisson,
who boasts a huge collection of reproduction quilts at her retail shop in
Southampton, N.Y. "They really traverse all social classes, reaching black,
white, wealthy, poor. They're so versatile. People can cover up their beds,
hang them on walls, use them as throws.";    Boisson also sells vintage
quilts, but at prices out of reach for the average buyer. The reproductions
range from $195 (baby quilts) to just under $1,000. Each of the all-cotton
quilts is marked and dated.;    (box)  Rugs. Rugs also have staying power.
Many rugs today are being created in the same manner as the old, with wool
colored by natural vegetable dyes and spun by hand.;    George Jevremovic says
his company, Woven Legends, is dedicated to "reviving the art of the rug.";   
Jevremovic directs nomads in southeast Turkey to weave to his specifications,
with designs patterned after old ones. "We get weavers to play a lot with
color and design. There's a spontaneity, variation and charm. Every rug we
produce is unique.";    (box)   The personal touch. You can also create your
own heirlooms. Making one-of-a-kind objects to give as gifts can be a lovely
sentiment. After all, it's personality and tradition that really make
keepsakes fascinating.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (check) David Bacharach, Adesso

<HEAD>Hands of Clock May Move Away From Nuclear Midnight</HEAD>

   Keepers of the Doomsday Clock say the world is
moving drastically away from the threat of nuclear war.
   For years the Doomsday Clock on the cover of The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists has been ticking back and forth toward midnight,
an indication of the state of superpower relations.
   After standing at six minutes before midnight _ or the threat of
nuclear war _ for two years, the Bulletin's April edition may turn
the clock back, reflecting recent reforms in the Soviet Union and
its Eastern European allies.
   Editor Len Ackland said Tuesday that a decision hasn't been made
on where the clock's hands will be in April.
   But Nobel laureate Leon M. Lederman, director emeritus of the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago and one of
the scientists whose opinions influence the clock's movement, said,
``I wanted the hands to move back the most. The danger of military
confrontation between the superpowers and the credibility of that
threat is lessening every hour.''
   The clock first appeared on the June 1947 Bulletin to evoke the
image of the apocalypse _ universal conflagration bursting forth at
the darkest hour _ and of military attack, with the countdown to
zero hour, Ackland said.
   The clock was closest to midnight _ two minutes away _ in 1953,
after the United States successfully tested the hydrogen bomb.
   It was farthest from midnight _ 12 minutes _ in 1963, after the
signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty, and again in 1972, when the
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty was signed.
   It last moved in 1988, shifting back from three minutes before
midnight to six minutes away, due in large part to the U.S.-Soviet
treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, Ackland
said.
   The Bulletin was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked at the
University of Chicago on the Manhattan Project _ the successful
U.S. effort to build an atomic bomb during World War II. Among its
founders were J. Robert Oppenheimer, sometimes called the father of
the atomic bomb, and Albert Einstein.
   The magazine, published by the Educational Foundation for
Nuclear Science, has 17,000 subscribers in 70 countries.
   The magazine's worldwide Board of Scientific Sponsors debates
the international climate through letters and over the telephone to
determine whether the hands of the clock should move.
   The sponsors make their recommendations to the Bulletin's board
of directors and editors, who have the final say.
   Lederman, a member of both boards, said he believes that since
World War II, the world has never been further from nuclear war
than it is now, though he added it will be hard for bureaucrats to
stop asking for huge military expenditures.
   But despite the general view among Bulletin sponsors that the
threat of nuclear war is diminishing, some note changes that could
pose a threat to peace.
   ``They are concerned by the growth of nationalism, strident
nationalism in Eastern Europe and other places,'' said Lederman,
who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in physics.

<HL> Technology: Los Angeles County Taps Atomic Clock To Improve the Timing of Its Stoplights </HL>

   A pioneering project synchronizing Los Angeles County traffic lights with the U.S. atomic clock in Boulder, Colo., is expected to save southern Californians thousands of hours of driving time a year, and sharply cut fuel use and pollution. 

   By tapping the precision of the official U.S. timekeeping device, county officials say they can improve the timing of stoplights on major roads to allow traffic to flow more smoothly at posted speeds. 

   The current five-year, $13 million plan covers 1,020 intersections along 43 of the county's busiest thoroughfares, or about half of those for which it is responsible. 
When completed, officials say motorists will save 55,000 hours a day in driving time and 22 million gallons a year in fuel otherwise spent slowing down, stopping, and reaccelerating because of imprecisely synchronized traffic signals. 
Auto emissions will also be cut by 6,000 to 7,000 tons of pollutants a year, they say. 

   "It's hard to put those dollars in your pocket, but they're being wasted or spent by someone," says Bob Young, western regional manager of Precision Standard Time Inc., a Fremont, Calif., concern and prime contractor on the project. 

   Precision Standard Time is modifying traffic signal control boxes at intersections with microprocessor-run clocks and special AM radio receivers tuned to the beat of the atomic timepiece in Colorado as broadcast by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's radio station, WWV, near Fort Collins, Colo. 

   Los Angeles County traffic signals are currently synchronized by a system using buried telephone cables connecting lights at one intersection to another. 
Besides running up a big phone bill, the system frequently falls out of sync because of downed or malfunctioning phone lines. 
On any given day, signal controllers at a dozen intersections fail to operate in step. 
"One bad intersection makes the whole system bad and gets traffic out of cue," says Larry Sanderson, head of the county's traffic signal lab. 

   Maintenance is also costly and time-consuming because the telephone company often must get involved. 

   The atomic clock on which the new system relies neither gains nor loses a second in 300,000 years. 
Its beats, controlled by the resolute resonance of a cesium atom, are broadcast without interruption 24 hours a day, 365 days a year from WWV and another station, WWVH, Kauai, Hawaii. 
The clock and stations are run by the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly the National Bureau of Standards. 

   The county is looking for funding to bring 1,200 additional intersections into the atomic clock-based system. 

   Precision Standard Time says it has delivered radio-equipped clocks to Seattle, Dayton, Ohio, and four smaller cities for the timing of stoplights. 
But the Los Angeles County project is the largest and first to use a radio at each intersection rather than a central unit connected to intersections by cable. 

   Precision Standard Time's president and chief executive officer, Michael W. Saber, says the city of Los Angeles is experimenting with the company's timing units in order to enable it to synchronize its lights with those on adjacent routes managed by the county. 

   Mr. Saber adds that the company's timing devices are accurate to within two milliseconds of the U.S. atomic clock.
