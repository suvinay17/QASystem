BOWMAN TO BRING TALENT HOME FOR PICKWICK SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: FORMER NATIONAL CHAMPION FROM VAN NUYS TO PERFORM IN BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Bowman and Todd Eldredge, winners of the past two U. S. national 
men's figure skating championships, are expected to participate in 
"Icetraveganza," a benefit show produced by the Los Angeles Figure Skating 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, Eldredge and several other of the club's international competitors will 
perform in shows Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Pickwick Ice Arena in 
Burbank. There will be no scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 23, will be returning to his old stomping grounds. He grew up in Van 
Nuys and trained with Coach Frank Carroll at Pickwick until last year when 
Carroll opened his own Ice Castles International Training Center near Lake 
Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge, 19, originally from Massachusetts, now trains in San Diego with Coach 
Richard Callaghan. Eldredge was the surprise winner of this year's national 
championships in Salt Lake City. Bowman, who was bothered by a back injury, 
placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Both skaters competed in August at the Goodwill Games in Seattle. Eldredge, 
coming off a fifth-place finish in the World Championships, placed third in the 
Goodwill Games behind world champion Kurt Browning of Canada and Viktor 
Petrenko of the Soviet Union. Bowman, who appeared out of shape, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the nation's top pairs team, also will perform. 
Sand, 26, from Thousand Oaks, and Kuchiki, 13, from Canoga Park, were second at 
the U.S. championships behind Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo. However, the 
gold medal-winning team split up to pursue singles careers soon after. 
</P>
<P>
Kuchiki's former partner, Richard Alexander, 21, from Simi Valley, will skate 
with his new partner, Tristen Vega, 16, from Torrance. Alexander and Vega 
joined forces a year ago and won the U.S. Juniors title only four months later. 
</P>
<P>
Other top names who will be appearing in the show include 1984 Olympian Tiffany 
Chin, 1988 Olympic bronze medalist Peter Oppegard and the Olympic Festival gold 
medal ice dancing team of Jeanne Miley and Michael Verlich. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds go to the club's Olympic and world competition fund with a portion 
donated to the fight against cerebral palsy.

<LEADPARA>  The U.S. Figure Skating Championships showed the depth in American men's and
women's figure skating.;    The competition also showed why figure skating
will be, once again, the United States' best hope for success at the Winter
Olympics in Albertville, France, in 1992.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  U.S. FIGURE SKATERS SHOW WHY THEY'LL BE TOP
OLYMPIC PROSPECTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In the 1988 Winter Olympics, the United States won only six medals. Three,
including one of just two golds the United States won, came in figure
skating.;    Next February, the United States should be strong in speed
skating and in freestyle skiing (a new event in 1992). The U.S. bobsled team
should provide, if nothing else, an offbeat story by fielding a team made up
of former track stars and NFL players.;    But skating, the glamour event of
the Winter Games and the one with the greatest television exposure, is where
the United States will salvage its wintertime reputation.;    The U.S. women
will be the strongest contenders. With compulsory figures a thing of the past,
free skaters can now excel. Japan's Midori Ito, the best female free skater in
the world, may be out of next month's world championships because of an
injury, giving the U.S. women a chance to sweep the world medals.;    "I would
think there's a chance of that," Coach Evy Scotvold said. "People saw probably
10 of the best women in the world (in Minneapolis).";    An international
judging panel is unlikely to hand all the medals to the United States, but
European champion Surya Bonaly, a 17-year-old acrobatic jumper who represents
France, has little style or sophistication on the ice.;    "European ladies
skating is abysmal," said renowned skating coach John Nicks. "Any of the top
five U.S. women could win a European title.";    New national champion Tonya
Harding, who at the nationals became the first U.S. woman to land the
difficult triple Axel in competition, showed she is capable of technically
matching Ito.;    "The question with Harding is, can she do that again?" Nicks
said. "She's been inconsistent through much of her career.";    Fremont's
Kristi Yamaguchi, on the other hand -- though disappointed with winning the
silver medal for the third consecutive year -- remains one of the most
consistent and complete skaters in the world.;    "I think being second may
only work to her advantage," said Toller Cranston, coach of Christopher Bowman
of the United States. "It's very difficult to hold onto first.";    The big
question will be three-time national and current world champion Jill Trenary.
Forced to withdraw from both the nationals and the worlds because of injury,
Trenary insists she will compete through 1992. But her past titles were earned
with the help of compulsory figures; without them, Trenary might have been
lucky to escape the Twin Cities with a bronze medal.;    Sunday's competition
also showed the depth in U.S. men's skating. Though Canada's Kurt Browning and
Soviet Viktor Petrenko are considered the top two male skaters, the U.S. men
will put up a fight in Albertville.;    National champion Todd Eldredge is
technically as sound a jumper as either Browning or Petrenko and will continue
to improve with maturity. Bowman, as competent a showman as the sport has to
offer, can never be ruled out.;    The depth in the men's event was
illustrated when Mark Mitchell, technically sound and stylish, was left off
the world team.;    "(The competition) was too bloody good," Cranston said.
"This was like a world championship.";    The United States probably won't
contend in either pairs or dance at the Olympics, but the men and women
skaters should be bringing home the precious medals.  </TEXT>

<P>
It's time to get serious, real serious, for Jill Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, the 1987 national champion, barely missed a medal at the Calgary 
Olympics, finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With all three medalists gone professional, Trenary not only is the top-rated 
American woman figure skater, but in line for the world championship, as well. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Trenary goes after her second crown in the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships -- she also finished second to Debi Thomas in the 1988 nationals 
and was fifth in the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it feels like to win and, obviously, I would love to win that 
back," says Trenary, 20, of Colorado Springs, Colo., who trains with 
world-renown coach Carlo Fassi. "I skated well at nationals last year, too. It 
just happens that Debi just edged me out a little bit. That was fine. That's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Being that I did come in second last year, it would make winning all the more 
exciting this year." 
</P>
<P>
And expected. While the men's competition has no overwhelming favorite, Trenary 
clearly is the frontrunner among the women, who get started with the compulsory 
figures on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it already," she says. "It's going to be a little more intense, a 
little bit more work. But I'm smart to recognize that and I'm ready. know what 
to expect, and if I know it and am prepared for it, I can just skate. I don't 
have to open a newspaper if I don't want." 
</P>
<P>
If she does some reading, she'll know that Caryn Kadavy, third in the last two 
nationals, is sidelined by a stress fracture of the left ankle. Jeri Campbell, 
fourth in the '88 nationals, also has a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest competition could come from Kristi Yamaguchi, who began her season 
with a strong second place in Tokyo. Trenary calls Yamaguchi "technically very 
strong" and expects a "tough challenge from her." 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi also skates pairs with Rudi Galindo, with whom she won the world 
junior title in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo also skates singles but shouldn't be a factor. The key to the men's 
competition could be Chris Bowman's leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman suffered a gash of his left ankle while performing a comical routine in 
an exhibition Dec. 1. The cut needed four layers of stitches and, according to 
Frank Carroll, Bowman's coach, the 21-year-old Californian's condition is 
"uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a serious injury, on the inside and outside of the ankle," Carroll 
says. "There was some muscle damage. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't had a lot of work -- Chris also had a pulled groin muscle. But he's 
been skating recently." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman was edged for second place in the nationals a year ago by Paul Wylie of 
Denver. Wylie won the Lalique Trophy in Paris last November but is not as 
spectacular a free skater as Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like comparing apples and oranges," Wylie says. "Chris has one 
extra trick, but I have a program that I think is more moving than his. This is 
the brass tacks, the long-program analysis, because it's going to come down to 
the long program." 
</P>
<P>
If it does, Bowman might have an ace in the hole, a triple axel. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit it at Skate America and that was a big step for me," says Bowman, 21, of 
Los Angeles. "But I also might have focused too much on it; some of the later 
jumps were difficult because, by then, my mind was out in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
The men's battle could be spiced by former world junior champion Todd Eldredge, 
who also has been sidelined by physical probems. Eldredge has bruised cartilage 
in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Back problems forced Scott Gregory to retire and his ice dance partner, Suzanne 
Semanick, found a new sidekick in Ron Kravette. Semanick-Gregory had won the 
last two U.S. crowns, but Semanick-Kravette are considered longshots in the 
dance, where significant movement in the standings is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The dance favorites are Susan Wynne and Joe Druar, who were runners-up in the 
'88 nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just happy to make the Olympics," Wynne says of 1988. "Eveybody was 
asking us, 'Aren't you mad you weren't first?' I thought, 'We're in the 
Olympics. It's OK.' 
</P>
<P>
"This year, it's just as nerve-racking for us. This year, it's first place, 
just like last year it was the Olympics as a goal. If we come in second this 
year, we wouldn't be happy." 
</P>
<P>
April Sargent and Russ Witherby are the main challengers. 
</P>
<P>
In pairs, with Olympic bronze medalists Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard now 
professionals, 1986 national champs Gillian Wachsman and Todd Waggoner figured 
to move up. But they returned to school, leaving Olympians Kim and Wayne 
Seybold as the top duo. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're the top-ranked team in the United States and we want to come 
here and prove that and win a gold medal," Wayne said. "We've been skating 
together 16 years and we've been junior national champions, we've been on the 
world team, the Olympic team, we've been second, third, fourth, fifth and ninth 
at senior nationals. We've won international competitions and things, but the 
one thing that's eluded us is the national championship. That's what this year 
is all about."

NEW GENERATION TAKES THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK

Katarina Witt and Brian Boitano are gone. The dueling Carmens and battling 
Brians have passed their blades to another generation. 
</P>
<P>
The new elite of international figure skating have their first major rendezvous 
at the world championships in Paris this week, battling for supremacy in the 
build-up to the next Winter Olympic Games three years from now. 
</P>
<P>
Europe's main challenge lies with veterans Alexandr Fadeev of the Soviet Union, 
the 1985 world champion, and West Germany's Claudia Leistner, while the United 
States pins its hopes on maturing skaters like Jill Trenary and Chris Bowman 
and newcomer Kristi Yamaguchi, who puts her 4 feet 11 inches, 82 pounds frame 
against the world's best in two events. The championships begin on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With each of the 1988 winners either retired or having turned professional, new 
world champions will be crowned in all four categories. 
</P>
<P>
Post-Olympic years traditionally give an early indication of fresh challengers 
for gold medals three years down the line although there are exceptions, as 
Witt proved to devastating effect. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a year after the Sarajevo Olympics, the East German super star 
repeated as world champion, then hung around to dominate the sport for another 
three years instead of making way for new titlists. 
</P>
<P>
Boitano was in the background behind Fadeev and the other big-name Brian, 
Canada's Brian Orser, while future Olympic pairs champions Ekaterina Gordeeva 
and Sergei Grinkov of the Soviet Union were still competing in junior 
competition, Trenary had not qualified for the American team yet and Bowman was 
regarded as a flashy, but undedicated, former child actor. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, Boitano and Orser have now left the amateur stage, giving way to Trenary, 
Bowman and other individualists, while Grinkov and Gordeeva have emerged as the 
world's top-ranked couple. 
</P>
<P>
The most competitive event at the Bercy Sports Palace, the first world 
championships to be staged in the French capital since 1958, will be the 
women's tournament where the also-rans of recent years will vie for the medals. 
</P>
<P>
With Witt, Canada's Liz Manley and America's Debi Thomas all having turned pro, 
the battle for gold will be between U.S. national champion Trenary, European 
champion Leister and Japan's Midori Ito. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, Ito and Leistner finished 4-5-6 at the Calgary Olympics while the 
order switched to Leistner, Trenary and Ito at the 1988 world championships in 
Budapest, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm the favorite at the worlds and I know what I have to do, " Trenary, 
20, said after winning her second U.S. title at Baltimore last month. 
</P>
<P>
Leistner, after years on the fringe of success, won the European crown in 
Birmingham, England, in January. The 24-year-old West German was a silver 
medalist at the 1983 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Ito, 20, delighted the Olympic crowd last year with her jumping ability and her 
happy demeanor and could benefit more than her rivals from the recent change of 
rule for the compulsory figures. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsories, in which Ito does not excel, are being reduced from three to two 
this year and will count for 20 percent of the total mark, compared to 30 
percent previously. 
</P>
<P>
A new original program replaces the short program, giving the skaters more time 
-- 2 minutes, 40 seconds -- to do the required number of moves and counting for 
30 percent of the mark. 
</P>
<P>
The final freeskating sequence is still worth 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Ito beat both Trenary and Leistner in the free skating at last year's worlds 
and Olympics. All three of them, however, will have to watch another jumper of 
Japanese origin, Yamaguchi. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, regarded by many as America's fastest rising star, landed seven 
triple jumps and beat Trenary in the free skating at the U.S. championships. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old astounded the skating world when she qualified for two events, 
coming in second overall behind Trenary and winning the pairs with Rudi 
Galindo. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Yamaguchi and Galindo may have to hope for a mistake from Gordeeva 
and Grinkov to win the gold. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Fadeev continues his comeback after an injury-filled 1988 
against compatriot Viktor Petrenko, who gained the bronze medal behind Boitano 
and Orser in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to take advantage of any slip-ups from the two Soviets will be Bowman 
and Canada's Kurt Browning. 
</P>
<P>
The dance event continues to be a Soviet stronghold with Marina Klimova and 
Sergei Ponamarenko now firm favorites after four years of second-place finishes 
behind the now-retired Natalia Bestemianova and Andrei Bukin.

<HEAD>Debi Thomas A Disappointing Third In Figure Skating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold
turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt
won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth
Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.
   ``It's over. Back to school,'' said Thomas, who won the bronze
medal despite three faulty landings. ``I'm not going to make any
excuses. I was really skating well this week. It wasn't supposed to
happen, I guess. But I tried.''
   While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to
music from Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Manley was so sensational in the
freestyle that she finished first with seven judges. Combined with
a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the
short program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley in
second place.
   Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the
first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold
in 1948 and '52. Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it
before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
   Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S.
figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly
Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games.
   By contrast, Manley had the sellout crowd at the Olympic
Saddledome enraptured. They cheered, hooted and stamped their feet
when she finished hitting every element of her program.
   Jill Trenary of Minnetonka, Minn., finished fourth. She was
fifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of the
overall score.
   Thomas' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for the
United States. Brian Boitano won the men's crown, and a bronze in
pairs went to Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.
   In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. team
had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.
   Speed skater Bonnie Blair, America's only double medalist, tried
again Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well off
the pace. She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000
meters.
   As the Olympics winded up its next-to-last day, the Soviet Union
had 27 medals, including 11 golds, while East Germany in second
place had 22, including nine golds.

<LEADPARA>  Rudy Galindo doesn't plan to simply fade away.;    Less than a year ago, the

<HEADLINE>  GALINDO SURVIVES BREAKUP, REVIVES HIS SINGLES
CAREER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to end of article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     When Galindo and Kristi Yamaguchi retired from pairs as the two-time
national champions last April, the focus was on Yamaguchi's future. After all,
her singles career had caused the breakup. Galindo's fate was an
afterthought.;    But he wasn't ready to give up.;    "I'm motivated to show
that I can come back," said Galindo, 21. "When we split up, I was left in the
cold with all this talent.";    So Galindo, who abandoned his promising
singles career in 1988 to focus on pairs skating, returned to the ice, solo,
with a new motivation and a rejuvenated attitude.;    "He's changed so much in
attitude," Galindo's sister Laura said. "He's more outgoing and so much
happier.";    Last month, Galindo surprised skeptics by finishing third at the
Pacific Coast Championships, qualifying to compete in the senior men's
division of this week's 1991 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in
Minneapolis.;    "I just want to start a fresh, new life," Galindo said.;   
Last April, Galindo was rocked by the news that Yamaguchi wanted to drop
pairs. Galindo, who had been the junior men's champion in 1987, had subjugated
much of his life to pairs skating, even changing the spelling of his first
name (from Rudy to Rudi) in a show of unity with his partner.;    But the
breakup didn't exactly come as a surprise. Galindo hated training in Canada,
where Yamaguchi had moved to be near her singles coach. He was left feeling
isolated after the death of his longtime coach, Jim Hulick. He continued to be
the black sheep of the pair, with questions about his motivation and training
habits a hot topic at competitions.;    "Last year was a nightmare for me," he
said.;    When the decision was made to split up, six weeks after the pair
finished fifth at the world championships, Galindo was depressed. But within
days, he was back on the ice, starting his singles career from scratch, this
time under the guidance of coach Rick Inglesi.;    "(Rick's) supportive and
outgoing . . . an 'up' person," Galindo said.;    Inglesi, who coaches at
Belmont Iceland, said: "I wanted him to feel good about himself. He lost a lot
of confidence as a person.";    So Galindo and Inglesi set about rebuilding
that confidence. Galindo did several exhibitions and finished second at the
Arctic Blades competition in Los Angeles. After years of trying to bulk up for
the lifts required for pairs skating, Galindo lost about 10 pounds and is back
to 145, more suited for his small frame. He built on the advantages he took
from pairs competition -- increased speed on the ice and savvy showmanship --
in his singles routines.;    Despite the preparation, Galindo's showing at
Pacific Coast surprised even him.;    "I thought I'd finish fifth, maybe,"
Galindo said.;    Instead, he finished third, behind the 1989 national
champion Christopher Bowman and Eric Larsen. Reigning national champion Todd
Eldredge received a bye.;    Galindo's goal for this week's competition is to
finish among the top 10. He wants to prove he's "close" by the 1992 Winter
Olympics, but his real sights are set on the 1994 Games.;    Galindo tries not
to think much about pairs skating or the split with Yamaguchi, though he said
it took months to feel better.;    What still hurts is that Yamaguchi, who has
been home to the Bay Area once since last summer, has not tried to contact
him. Yamaguchi said her schedule has prevented her from seeing Galindo.;    "I

Center, Minneapolis; WHEN: Tuesday through Sunday; TV COVERAGE: Saturday,
ABC-TV, "Wide World of Sports" from 4:30 to 6 p.m. PST; Sunday, ABC-TV, from 1
to 3 p.m. PST.; KEY EVENTS: Pairs final -- Friday, 5:30 p.m. PST; Women's
final -- Saturday, 11 a.m. PST; Men's final -- Sunday, 11 a.m. PST.; WHAT TO
LOOK FOR: The medalists at this national championships will be the
front-runners to make the 1992 Olympic team.; TOP WOMEN: Kristi Yamaguchi, who
has won the silver medal two years in a row, is the favorite because of the
withdrawal of two-time national champion and reigning world champion Jill
Trenary, who underwent surgery to relieve a major infection in her ankle
tendon in January. Last year's bronze medalist, Holly Cook, who also finished
third at the world championships, is back.; TOP MEN: Last year's national
champion, Todd Eldredge, is back with another year of maturity under his belt.

competition, there is a void in U.S. pairs skating. Last year's silver
medalists, Natasha Kuchiki and Todd Sand, are back, along with the 1990 bronze
medalists, Sharon Carz and Doug Williams.; TOP ICE DANCERS: Two-time national

<TEXT>     "It will be like my graduation ball, my debutante ball," she said. "I'm
just playing a young girl who's now coming out to her party and having fun."; 
 This winter is intended to be just that.;   Although she begins the season as
reigning world champion and defending champion of Skate America, the huge
segment of the public that turns its attention to figure skating only in
Olympic years is about to be introduced to Yamaguchi for the first time.;  
This is an Olympic winter, and it will be the 20-year-old Yamaguchi's first
appearance in the Winter Games.;   Keyed to original program; Everything must
be right, and it starts with the 2-minute, 40-second original program, which
accounts for a third of the final score.;   Yamaguchi will skate to Johann
Strauss Jr.'s "Blue Danube" waltz, a dreamy, lyrical waltz piece to show a
more mature skater than judges have seen in her previous three years of
international competition.;   Her four-minute long program, which accounts for
the rest of the final score, will be done to the Spanish "Malaguena,"
suggested by her mother, Carole, because Kristi used it earlier in her career
with great success.;   Both programs have been under development since March
in Edmonton, her training base of the last two years.;   She and her coach,
Christy Kjarsgaard-Ness, worked out the spins and jumps they wanted in each
piece including seven triple jumps in the long program. Toronto choreographer
Sandra Bezic then integrated their ideas into a program that fit the music.;  
The Olympics in February, and the 1992 world championships a month later in
Oakland, are the ultimate forum for the programs. But Skate America and a
November competition in France are where they will be fine-tuned.;   "You have
to look at these (pre-Olympic competitions) as experience," Kjarsgaard-Ness
said. "If the programs turn out good, great. If you need to make corrections,
you make corrections just like preseason games in any sports.";   For
Yamaguchi, it was fortunate that Skate America, usually the season opener for
top U.S. skaters, is being held almost in her home town.;   Yet she is trying
to avoid putting pressure on herself to win before her hometown fans.;   "I
don't think it's important for me to go in there and think, 'Oh, I've got to
win this. I've got to do this,' " she said.;   "It is early in the season yet,
and it's important to get my new programs out and see how they feel on the ice
and see how the crowd and the judges like or don't like them. I think Skate
America will be an experiment to see how everything will go over.";   Tonya
Harding, who beat Yamaguchi for last winter's national championship before
finishing second at the worlds, also will compete at Skate America. Todd
Eldredge, U.S. men's champion and bronze medalist at the world championships,
will compete along with Christopher Bowman.;   Skate America runs Sept. 18-22
at the Oakland Coliseum Arena with competition in pairs and ice dancing.; IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED; Single-day tickets for Skate America cost from $6 to $20,
and seven-day packages that include two practice days cost $40 to $80. Tickets
can be purchased at the Coliseum Box Office or through BASS/Ticketmaster
outlets.; MOVING UP IN WORLD; Kristi Yamaguchi's singles record:; Year

   The Winter Olympics won't end until Sunday, but figure
skater Todd Eldredge and luger Erica Terwilligar are already
starring in a new painkiller ad.
   In newspaper ads out today, Mr. Eldredge and Ms.
Terwilligar are pictured as winners of Bristol Myers Squibb's
Nuprin "Comeback Award." Though neither won an Olympic medal,
the ad congratulates both for bouncing back from injuries to
compete.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Eldredge and Ms. Terwilligar may be the first among
America's athletes to trade on Olympic glory -- but only by a
hair. Speed skater Bonnie Blair's agent reports a flood of
phone calls from soft drink, fast food and other companies
following her two goldmedal performances. And ad executives
say figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, currently in first place,
will hit the endorsement jackpot if she skates away with the
gold tonight.
   In the coming weeks, ad executives expect the two female
skating stars and, to a lesser extent, a third -- mogul skier
and gold medalist Donna Weinbrecht -- to cash in with some
visible endorsement deals, including star turns in ads. But
most other Olympic athletes who try to dip into the
endorsement pot will come up dry. America's paltry collection
of medals, and its dearth of compelling personalities, means
few stars were born in the snowdrifts of Albertville.
   In fact, some of the most highly touted athletes watched
tens of thousands of dollars of potential endorsements
evaporate after disappointing performances. Skier A.J. Kitt
and speed skater Dan Jansen had been at the top of almost
every advertiser's list. But neither won even a bronze medal.
   Other athletes who come home empty-handed face similarly
dim prospects. Even Mr. Eldredge and Ms. Terwilligar, both of
whom have received plenty of good press, probably won't be in
the public eye for long. A Nuprin spokeswoman says the two
won't be part of the brand's continuing "Nupe it" campaign
starring tennis great Jimmy Connors. The ad they star in is a
one-time-only "salute" to them, she says, and they weren't
paid for it.
   Be prepared to see plenty of a select few others, though,
especially speed skater Ms. Blair. Not only did the skater
repeat her 1988 gold medal triumph, but "her interviews were
terrific; she was a smiley, fresh, all-American girl," says
Nova Lanktree of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago,
which matches athletes with advertisers. Ms. Lanktree says
she has gotten more advertiser inquiries about Ms. Blair than
about any other Olympic athlete.
   Ms. Blair, who signed on with the professional management
firm of Advantage International two years ago, already has a
number of advertiser affiliations, including Visa, Evian and
Xerox. But she mostly has made personal appearances, rather
than starring in ads -- a situation her agents hope they can
turn around with the new gold medals. Helen Wald of Advantage
International, interrupting her conversation to field
frequent phone calls about Ms. Blair, says the firm is
considering a host of offers: "It's a nice feeling."
   Several ice hockey players also have endorsement potential
should the team win the gold, particularly goalie Ray
LeBlanc, ad executives say. And Nancy Kerrigan, the figure
skater currently in second place, also may be able to cash
in, they say. Ms. Kerrigan already appears in a Texaco
commercial, although she isn't identified in it.
   The Americans face stiffer competition for endorsements
than ever before, though, and from an unlikely source: the
former Soviet bloc. Katarina Witt, the 1988 figure skating
gold medalist, is by far the most commercially successful
1988 Olympian -- she even stars in a Diet Coke commercial --
despite the fact that she hails from the former East Germany.
Several top athletes from Russia and Eastern Europe have
taken a cue from Ms. Witt, and have retained U.S. agents to
find commercials for them, too.
   Michael Goldberg, whose Marco Entertainment represents
such U.S. figure skaters as Tonya Harding and Christopher
Bowman, recently added to his roster two Russian pairs
medalists, along with gold medal figure skater Viktor
Petrenko of Ukraine.
   Mr. Petrenko "has matinee idol looks, the girls scream,"
Mr. Goldberg enthuses. And while male figure skaters have
traditionally had little endorsement appeal, he concedes, "if
anyone can break through," Mr. Petrenko can.

   Philip Morris Rebudgets
                                                                                                       

   Philip Morris Cos., the second-largest U.S. advertiser, is
budgeting a "slight overall increase" in ad spending this
year. But chairman and marketing whiz Michael A. Miles says
he intends to get his money's worth.
   Yesterday, Mr. Miles indicated in a meeting with
securities analysts in Florida that the money behind
campaigns that don't jingle the cash register would be
reallocated. "Where we aren't satisfied with our advertising
-- until we see a way to fix it -- we are shifting dollars
into consumer promotion," he said.
   A company spokeswoman declined to identify those brands.
   Philip Morris spent $2.21 billion in 1990 on ads for
everything from salad dressing to cigarettes, according to
the trade magazine Advertising Age.
   Mr. Miles emphasized spending would increase only for
advertising that "either builds volume profitably or
ferociously defends our core brands and categories." Food
brands getting strong support, Mr. Miles said, include
Jell-O, handled by Young & Rubicam; Miracle Whip and Kraft
cheese singles, handled by WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson;
and pourable salad dressings, handled by Leo Burnett Co.
   Mr. Miles emphasized that marketing support for premium
cigarette and beer brands would continue. "It's It. And
That's That," Leo Burnett's new Miller Lite campaign, is
"improving Lite's awareness, image, and usage measures," he
said.

   Rosenfeld Scales Back
                                                                                                       

   In the wake of the loss of its big Royal Caribbean Cruise
Line account, New York agency Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey &amp;
Strauss is expected to dismiss as many as 40 of the 140
people on its payroll, industry executives say.
   Agency co-chairman Hal Strauss said the staff reductions
wouldn't be that severe, but confirmed that "necessary
cutting back" was under way.
   Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean's abrupt move of its $35
million account to McKinney &amp; Silver of Raleigh, N.C., leaves
another cruise account up for grabs. McKinney had to resign
Kloster Cruise Ltd.'s estimated $25 million Norwegian Cruise
Line account in order to take on Royal Caribbean.

A GALA FOR THE STARS OF THE ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John W. Kluge, last month named the wealthiest man in the United States by 
Forbes magazine, surveyed the Arcadia ballroom of Loew's Santa Monica Beach 
hotel, where 700 current and former Ice Capades performers, crew, creative 
staff and executives had gathered for the venerable ice show's 50th anniversary 
gala reunion on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
They were almost all there, hundreds of past and present stars of the ice. 
Missing was Peggy Fleming, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist in women's figure 
skating, who sent her regrets after the Northern California earthquake. Robin 
Cousins, the 1980 Olympic men's figure skating champion, told the crowd he'd 
talked with Fleming and she said, "I'd love to be there, but my house is in 
eight different parts of San Jose right now." 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, chairman of Metromedia Co., owned Ice Capades for 23 years, selling the 
show in 1986 to Thomas K. Scallen, while remaining a partner. He and Metromedia 
executive vice president Stuart Subotnick flew in from Charlottesville for the 
evening, joining celebrants from throughout the United States and Canada as 
well as Europe, Australia and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold the show but we never left the people," Kluge said. "They are what Ice 
Capades is all about -- it's the huge family." 
</P>
<P>
The "family" reunion began with a cocktail party Saturday evening at Pomodoro, 
continued Sunday with attendance of an Ice Capades performance at the Forum 
starring 1988 Olympic women's figure skating silver medalist Elizabeth Manley 
and pair-skating silver medalists Natalie and Wayne Seybold, and culminated 
with the post-show bash at Loew's. 
</P>
<P>
At cocktail time at the hotel's atrium lobby, Cousins marveled, "I just met the 
man who's the reason I skate. I saw Nicky Powers playing the prince in a 
production of 'Sleeping Beauty' on ice in 1967 and said 'I love skating, I have 
to skate.' " 
</P>
<P>
The musings and recollections continued over dinner: warm salmon mousse in 
lobster sauce, salad, sauteed breast of chicken with morels in mustard sauce. 
</P>

The 1984 Olympic champion in men's figure skating, Scott Hamilton, and silver 
medalist Peter Carruthers reminisced about the winter games. Ken Shelley, 1972 
U.S. champion and Olympic contender in men's and pair skating, told former 
chorus skater Linda Illsley Simons about the all-star skating AIDS benefit to 
be held Monday at New York City's 26th Street Armory.

Hamilton and Cousins emceed the program. Besides Kluge, speakers included 
Scallen and George and Denise Eby -- he a former Ice Capades chairman and she a 
member of the first company. Receiving cheers and applause were such former 
favorites as Donna Atwood, Bobby Specht, Bob Paul and Barbara Wagner, Sonya 
Dunfield, Norah and Michael Kirby, Robin Lee, Aja Zanova, and Tim Wood; ice 
clowns Freddie Trenkler and Terry Head; and the oldest attendee, 92-year-old 
Irma Thomas, an early Ice Capades star.

The evening officially ended with a film of Ice Capades highlights. But 
numerous people lingered to chat, reluctant to leave after waiting so long to 
find each other again.

<LEADPARA>  FIGURE skater Brian Boitano could be satisfied doing what many of his
predecessors have done: win an Olympic gold medal, ride the lucrative
professional ice-show circuit for a while and then slowly fade into the mist.;
  Occasionally, some former champions resurface as coaches or perhaps as
winter sports television analysts.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Skate America  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But it nettles Boitano that the Olympic flame for competitors has to die.
He envies basketball's Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson and other athletes who
will be returning to the Olympic stage because their sporting bodies have
opened the door for pros to engage in open competition.;   In other words, the
best in the world against the best in the world, without all that hypocrisy
used to separate amateurs and pros.;   "I wish I could do what he (Jordan) is
going to do and still keep the money I have made," said Boitano, who put on an
exhibition Saturday night for Skate America International at the Coliseum
Arena. "After I won the gold medal at Calgary (1988 Olympic Games), I felt I
was up against a wall. There was no reason to stay amateur. But now, with many
sports changing rules to let pros back in, I yearn to go back and try again.";
  The most intriguing aspect would be to see how far Boitano could go. We've
seen aging heroes such as Jack Nicklaus, Jimmy Connors and Nolan Ryan
successfully test their mettle against the younger set. But no figure skater
has had the chance.;   Boitano, 27, probably is still the best figure skater
in the world.;   Skater Damon Allen says Boitano never stops improving. Coach
Ron Ludington, whose pairs team won the first prize last week in Oakland,
believes Boitano is in a class by himself. "I defy anyone to defeat him," he
says.;   The hang-up is each sport makes its own rules on Olympic eligibility,
and the International Skating Union, with members in three-dozen countries,
isn't ready to follow basketball, hockey, tennis and others into open
competition.;   "The Skating Union is made up of people who like to control
things," said Boitano, a Sunnyvale native who now resides in San Francisco.
"If the professionals are allowed back in, the union will lose that control.";
  Linda Leaver of Belmont, who has been Boitano's coach since he started
skating at age 8, said the ISU's policy is "very arbitrary and definitely
political.;   "It's no longer a matter of being an amateur or a pro. Now the
skaters are called 'eligibles' and 'ineligibles.' The eligibles, people like
Kristi Yamaguchi, can compete in sanctioned events for money, which is great.
But the ineligibles, like Brian, are out because they competed in unsanctioned
events. So you can see how arbitrary this is.";   Boitano, who has had his own
ice show the last two years, has employed Yamaguchi and other eligibles. They
are paid, with the money going into a special trust fund that the skaters can
draw on.;   But even if the ISU changed its rules today, there wouldn't be
enough time for Boitano to prepare for the '92 Olympics. After that, the next
Winter Games will be in '94 and Boitano, who would be 30, could be shooting
for another gold medal.;   "It would be kind of strange, competing against
Scott Hamilton again, Todd Eldredge, Brian Orser, Kurt Browning," he said.
"One reason against going back in is I wouldn't want the younger skaters to
hate me. However, it isn't set in stone the older guys would win. We might
lose, you know.";   But right now the question is purely hypothetical. And it
doesn't have to be that way.  </TEXT>

   Figure skater Brian Boitano won the
United States' first gold medal of the Winter Olympics on Saturday,
beating Canadian world champion Brian Orser.
   Orser took the silver and Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union
was third for the bronze.
   Boitano's win gives the United States one gold; one silver, also
won Saturday; and one bronze as the Olympics ended its first week.
   Boitano, the 1986 world champion and a four-time American
titlist, took the long program with a sensational exhibition of
freestyle skating.
   The 24-year-old from Sunnyvale, Calif., who was fifth in the
1984 Olympics, depicted the various stages of a soldier's life to
music from the film ``Napoleon.''
   He successfully performed all eight triple jumps, including two
in combination, and drew a standing ovation from the sellout crowd
at the Olympic Saddledome.
   He also won over five of the nine judges, who gave him eight
marks of 5.9 and one perfect 6.0, from the Czechoslovakian judge
for artistic impression.
   Orser, 26, also came in second at the 1984 Winter Olympics in
Sarajevo, losing the gold to another American, Scott Hamilton.
   Earlier Saturday, speed skater Eric Flaim won the first silver
medal for the United States. Andre Hoffmann beat Flaim by .06
seconds, giving East Germany its second gold medal of the day and
leading another Soviet-bloc day at the Olympics.
   The only other U.S. medal was a bronze in pairs figure skating
won Tuesday night by Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.
   The Soviets now have 14 medals, including five golds; and East
Germany has 10, including six golds.

REIGNING U.S. MEN'S CHAMPION SKATES TO VICTORY

Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "This was the greatest depth I've ever seen at a nationals," said Wylie's
coach, Evy Scotvold.;    But Eldredge beat them all.;    Eldredge, relaxed and
confident, won the men's long program and his second consecutive national
title Sunday. Eldredge, 19, put aside any questions about the validity of last
year's gold medal, won after Bowman withdrew from the nationals because of
back spasms.;    "I knew in my mind that last year's championship was
(legitimate)," Eldredge said.;    Sunday's competition was odd. Four very
different skaters made it a very close but subdued competition. There was no
fire on the ice and none of the electricity in the air that had accompanied
the women's competition Saturday.;    The athletic Eldredge, the showy Bowman
and the stylistic Wylie finished one-two-three in the long program, which
accounts for two-thirds of the total score, and will make up the U.S. world
team for the second consecutive year. Bowman, as the reigning national
champion at the time, received a bye onto the world team last year, knocking
bronze medalist Mitchell off the team.;    Once again, impressive up-and-comer
Mitchell, who had one of the cleanest performances of the competition, will be
staying at home.;    "That's what makes U.S. skaters so good," Mitchell, 22,
said diplomatically. "We have to work so hard for everything.";    Bowman,
wearing a black velvet body suit with a white shawl collar, skated first in
the final group.;    The more serious Bowman, skating to dramatic symphonic
music, was obviously better prepared than he had been in his last several
major competitions.;    A change in coaches and a realization that this is
last realistic shot at the Olympics resulted in the new look.;    "I think the
audience could sense this was not just Christopher Bowman (putting on a
show)," Bowman said.;    Bowman landed his triple Axel, the jump he considers
his nemesis.;    "Before it, I kept saying to myself, 'Be careful, be careful,
just be careful,' " Bowman, 23, said. "I felt all three wishes were used up on
the triple Axel.";    Bowman stepped out of his next jump, a triple-flip. It
was his one mistake. Altogether he attempted seven triples and landed six
cleanly.;    He also included some traditional Bowman mannerisms: unabashedly
flirting with a female judge and playing to the television cameras. But the
overall result lacked the flashy, excitement of the old Bowman. The audience
politely applauded, and the judges showed their admiration with scores of 5.8s
and one 5.7 for technical merit and 5.8s and 5.9s for presentation.;   
Clearly there was room for Eldredge, both with the judges and with the
audience.;    "Every skater that followed Christopher benefited from his
performance and his energy," said Bowman's coach, Toller Cranston.;   
Eldredge took the ice next.;    "I had all the pressure of defending my title
and skating after Christopher," said Eldredge, a native of Chatham, Mass. "But
I was able to rise to the occasion.";    Wearing a cream shirt and mauve pants
and skating to music from "Les Miserables," Eldredge, who had planned eight
triple jumps, hit his first seven cleanly and left the final one out. He was
the only skater to include two triple Axels in his long program and did the
hardest combination of the night, a triple Axel/triple Toe.;    Eldredge's
style still isn't sophisticated, but he showed a maturity that was lacking
last year. In addition to the height and velocity on jumps, his strengths are
his speed and ability to fill up the ice.;    "I try to make every movement as
big as it can be," Eldredge said. "It's a big rink. I want the people up in
the nosebleed seats to get their money's worth.";    Eldredge received marks
of 5.8 and 5.9 for technical merit and marks ranging from 5.7 to 5.9 for
style.;    Mitchell skated third, landed six triple jumps and appeared to have
clinched the bronze medal. But he received low marks for presentation as the
audience raucously booed the judges.;    Wylie, 26, performing the same long
program for the third year in the row, was -- as always -- the sentimental
favorite. He landed five triples and won the bronze thanks to his style
marks.;    Despite the lack of excitement in the arena, Sunday's competition
proved that the U.S. men skaters are strong.;    "It was too bloody good out
there," Cranston said. "This was at a very high level."; U.S. 1991 WORLD TEAM;

<P>
It is said that he could be figure skating's king. Instead, Christopher Bowman 
seems to prefer playing the court jester. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a choice of doing it straight or improvising, the 1989 U.S. men's 
champion often makes like Robin Williams. In skating and in life. 
</P>
<P>
In sixth place after the short program at the Goodwill Games, Bowman's 
intentions going into Friday night's free skating program were anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, he said he might be tempted -- again -- to abandon his 
usual routine and ad-lib a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Would he be, as he once proclaimed, "Hans Brinker from hell", or settle for 
Bowman the Showman? 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, neither. He deviated from his plans some, but not entirely by 
design. 
</P>
<P>
A triple axel and a triple salchow both became singles. But only out of 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Having trained for less than a month, Bowman, 23, was out of shape and playing 
it safe. His caution was very out of character. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been somewhat of a glass house lately, wondering when the stones were 
going to come down," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
There were cracks showing after Thursday night's short program, but Bowman 
recovered some with Friday's fairly stylish free-skating routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared I was going to walk away from this event sad and not 
learning anything," Bowman said. "I turned it into something positive." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, from Van Nuys, finished sixth among eight skaters. Canada's Kurt 
Browning, two-time world champion, won the gold medal, with Viktor Petrenko of 
the Soviet Union taking silver and U.S. champion Todd Eldredge placing third 
for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge was in fifth place after Thursday's original program. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman failed to move up, but he stuck with his program. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a similar situation in March at the World Championships in Halifax, 
Canada, he was full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
In fifth place after the short program, Bowman had a change of plans halfway 
through his free-skating exercise. He decided the routine that he, his coach 
and a handful of other advisers had worked on for months wasn't quite difficult 
enough. It needed a touch more pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
So, after considering his options for a few mili-seconds, Bowman did what any 
true showman would do. He made the rest of it up on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
His daring paid off. He jumped two places in the standings and won a bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Carroll has been Bowman's coach for 18 years, but their relationship has 
been on thin ice since Bowman free-lanced his way through the World 
Championships. Maybe before. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one crazy person in the sport," Carroll once lamented during a 
light-hearted moment, "why is it I have to be the one who coaches him?" 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's comments after the World Championships carried a more serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to remain Christopher's friend, I cannot be his coach," Carroll 
said privately. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was still with Bowman this week, but seemed none to pleased about it. 
He declined interview requests all week, telling a spokesman he was "tired of 
lying and covering" for Bowman and that he had "nothing positive to say." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, whose list of strait-laced proteges includes Linda Fratianne, seems to 
have tired of Bowman's antics. 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, when Bowman, a cherubic 5-year-old, used to act up in 
Carroll's class at Van Nuys Iceland, the coach simply picked him up and tossed 
him in a waste basket to show him who was boss. It's not so simple now. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman and Carroll clashed before the Goodwill Games. Bowman wanted to come. 
Carroll didn't. "He was very reluctant about coming to this event because he 
felt they if you're not totally prepared than you shouldn't be going," Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In pairs skating, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov led a medals sweep by 
the Soviets. Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the United States' top-ranked team, 
was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also swept the ice-dancing competition, with Sergei Ponomarenko and 
Marina Klimova winning the gold medal.

   Winter Olympics 1992 -- On the Games:
   For a Finale,
   Ice `Gingers'
   Turn Games

   ALBERTVILLE, France -- Waiting for a speed-skating race to
start last week, I wandered into the nearby rink that houses
figure skating as a number of couples practiced for that
evening's pairs event. Most were dressed in sweat clothes and
were going through just parts of their routines, but one
couple ended an especially lengthy and spirited passage by
sliding across the ice together, arms outstretched, in a
culminating bow.
   Most of the several hundred spectators on hand broke into
applause, which so delighted the pair -- they were Czechs, I
think -- that they up and did their bow again.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This is sport? thought I. Does Bonnie Blair practice
bowing?
   Does Alberto Tomba? Does Raisa Smetanina?
   Well, maybe Mr. Tomba does.
   But here we are, after two weeks of sports timed down to
the hundreth of a second, of sports involving more high-tech
hardware (bobsleds, luges, skis prepared for every
conceivable snow condition) than you'll find at your local
Sharper Image store, of a sport (speed skiing) in which the
competitors try to turn themselves into human bullets, and we
come down to a finale that is pure show biz.
   We have watched Freds and Gingers, then just Freds, and
now just Gingers, and it is the Gingers we like best, at
least that's what CBS tells us. Tonight it will be Our Girls
-- Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan -- against Theirs --
Midori Ito and Surya Bonaly -- and if one of Ours wins many
will judge these Winter Olympics a success no matter how
disappointingly some of our sweaty types have fared.
   And who will decide who wins? Why, the judges, of course,
using a system so complicated that Juan Antonio Samaranch,
the big boss of these Games, recently confessed it was beyond
his understanding. It is, basically, a poll, like the one we
use to decide the national collegiate football championship.
But there's more to it than that, and maybe it will help if I
explain.
   First off, you should know that figure skating no longer
has anything to do with figures. As recently as the last
Olympics, skaters were required to show up early one morning
in utilitarian dress and trace figure eights and
loop-the-loops on the ice. The judges examined these for
precision and awarded scores that were worth 30% of the
skaters' totals.
   This process, however, has been jettisoned as unsuited to
this visual age, and while most applaud the subtraction, some
do not. "An art has been lost," a British coach opined the
other day within my hearing, and, alas, it is so.
   What's left are two performance-to-music programs -- a
short one (two minutes, 40 seconds) and a long one (4 1/2
minutes) -- which the judges rate for artistry and technique
in tenths of a point on a scale of 0 to 6. (Why don't they
just use a scale of 0-to-60?) The thing to remember here is
that the numerical scores are not added up to produce a
total. What's important is how each judge rates each skater
relative to all of the other skaters. So a skater can get a
middling 5.5 score from a judge but still earn a first-place
vote if that judge scores no one higher.
   There's more to it than that. Weightings are involved, as
well as a tiebreaking system whose twists and turns puts the
NFL's to shame. But that's what computers are for.
   I once asked a figure skating judge why the system had to
be so complex. He answered that the more "improvements" were
made in the name of fairness and precision, the more tangled
things got. Who says sports aren't a microcosm of life?
   Beyond the arthimetic, though, are human beings expressing
preferences, and the judges surely have these. Some like
blondes, some brunettes. Some like tall, some like short.
Some like pepper, some like plain. Tonight's field has it
all.
   Ms. Ito, of Japan, and Ms. Yamaguchi, of Fremont, Calif.,
both world champions since the '88 Games, were expected to be
the main contenders for the gold medal, and they are
quite-different types. Ms. Ito is short (4-foot-7) and
stocky, Ms. Yamaguchi is taller (5 feet even) and slimmer.
Ms. Ito is robustly athletic, doing triple-turn leaps by the
truckload, and while Ms. Yamaguchi does some, too, her
skating style is smoother and more lyrical. The athletic
equivalent of a wine tasting was forecast.
   But in Wednesday night's short program, Ms. Ito landed
kerplunk on her left side after her first leap while Ms.
Yamaguchi sailed through her routine cleanly, so Ms.
Yamaguchi was first and Ms. Ito fourth at evening's end.
That's a wide gap to close in the figs, so two other young
women must be considered as gold-medal maybes: Nancy Kerrigan
of Stoneham, Mass., who is second, and Surya Bonaly of
France, who is third.
   Ms. Kerrigan and Ms. Bonaly match up much like Ms.
Yamaguchi and Ms. Ito: Ms. Kerrigan's the smoothie and Ms.
Bonaly's the jock. The latter, a powerfully haunched
18-year-old, is said to have accomplished four-turn leaps in
practice (revolutionary]), and someday may jump right out of
an arena. How she would be scored for doing that remains to
be seen.
   And while it takes more than remaining erect to get a good
score in figure skating, it's also true that grading a skater
who has fallen remains the great mystery of the sport. I have
asked judges about this, and they say that much depends on
the move in which the fall occured (tough is better than
easy), and on whether or not the fall hampers the remainder
of the skater's routine.
   But several days of figure-skating watching has convinced
me that other factors come into play, including the
nationalities of the judges and skaters involved. For
instance, Anisette Torp-Lind of Denmark did a perfectly
lovely, and perfect, short program Wednesday. She placed
eighth overall, but ranked 13th on the Japanese judge's
chart, while this same lady gave the fallen Ms. Ito a third.
   And last Saturday, in the men's final, the winner, Victor
Petrenko of the United Team, had to place both hands on the
ice to steady himself after a mishap, but scored higher than
sixth-place Kurt Browning of Canada, who needed but one hand
to right himself after his bobble. Mr. Petrenko might have
done other things better than Mr. Browning, but I guess your
Little League coach was correct when he said a two-handed
catch is best.

<MEMO>  U.S. Figure Skating Championships
Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Bowman, who hadn't won a major competition on U.S. soil in 16 months and
had considered retiring after finishing sixth at the Goodwill Games in August,
finished first in the men's short program at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships. Reigning national champion Todd Eldredge placed second, and
last year's bronze medalist, Mark Mitchell, was third. Whichever of the top
three skaters wins Sunday's long program will win the gold medal.;   
Abandoning his former campy, B-movie persona, Bowman went for a classical and
theatrical look and proved he could pull it off.;    "Basically, what I wanted
to do was turn the clock back and repeat what happened in 1989," said Bowman,
who won the national championship that year.;    Bowman skated 10th of the 16
skaters, following Eldredge. El-dredge skated a fast, clean program -- easily
landing a triple-Axel, double-toe combination -- but there was a spark, an
element of showmanship, missing.;    And then Bowman the Showman took the
ice.;    Bowman's new coach, Toller Cranston, had promised a different look, a
Bowman "dipped in black," and he delivered. With an outfit of black velvet,
void of a single sparkle or sequin, topped by hair that was dyed shoe-polish
black and a face powdered white, Bowman looked as though he had spent the last
several months training in a crypt, rather than Toronto.;    Skating to
Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3, Bowman matched the most difficult combination
jump of the night -- triple-Lutz, triple-toe -- and cleanly landed both a
triple flip and a double Axel.;    Though he was different and dramatic,
Bowman definitely wasn't dull. Nor could he completely subdue the campier side
of his personality. After landing one jump, Bowman turned to the television
camera, winked and stuck out his tongue.;    "There was a little of the old
showman showing through under that thick black velvet skin," Bowman said.
"When they announce, 'From Los Angeles, California' . . . it's all too
familiar.";    Mitchell skated the second-showiest program of the night.
Adequate but forgetful last year, the skater from Hamden, Conn., has found his
own style. He won over the crowd with a seductive, nightclubish performance to
saxophone music and knocked the perennially popular Paul Wylie to fourth
place.;    "This year I've found my style and what works best for me,"
Mitchell, 22, said.;    It didn't work best for San Jose's Rudy Galindo, who
had to follow Mitchell. It was Galindo's first solo performance at a major
competition since he finished 10th at the 1988 national championships.;    "I
was nervous. . . . It was hard to skate after Mark," said Galindo, who split
with pairs partner Kristi Yamaguchi last April after they had won back-to-back
national titles. "It was hard to be out there by myself.";    But Galindo gave
it a gutsy shot, attempting a triple-Axel, double-toe combination, though he
two-footed the landing on the Axel.;    "At least I went for the hardest
thing," he said. "I didn't wimp out.";    Galindo, whose goal is to finish in
the top 10, is in 12th place going into the long program.;  ETC.: Bowman split
from Frank Carroll, his coach of 18 years, after the Goodwill Games and
Thursday had broken down in front of reporters, saying he and Carroll never
spoke anymore. But Friday, Carroll indicated that Bowman's histrionics were
prompted by something other than their relationship and that he and Bowman
continue to have cordial, though superficial, contact. "I wish Christopher the
very best," Carroll said. "But it's over. For 18 years, I gave it my best
shot.";  CHAMPIONSHIPS AT A GLANCE; What: The 1991 U.S. Figure Skating

<HL> U.S. Olympians Get Disappointing Scores For Their Endorsement Earning Power </HL>
<AUTHOR> Joanne Lipman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> MKT </IN>
<TEXT>
   Before the Winter Olympics began, U.S. figure-skater Debi Thomas was the darling of the advertising industry. 
Graceful, attractive, and widely predicted to win a gold or silver medal, she seemed a natural to endorse anything from candy to cars. 

   But when Ms. Thomas missed her first triple-jump during the finals, she lost not only a shot at the gold but also a potential $1 million or more in endorsement earning power. 
The bronze medal she did earn, ad executives say, may be worth only $100,000 or less in endorsements. 
"As of now," says Marty Blackman of New York talent consultant Blackman &amp; Raber, "the advertising industry isn't going to open their arms to her." 

   Ms. Thomas's rather literal slip from grace was just one of a series of disappointments for the American team that, in cash terms, will cost the athletes a bundle. 
"In past Olympics, there would seem to be a hero, like a Bruce Jenner or Mary Lou Retton or a Dorothy Hamill," says Daisy Sinclair, head of casting for ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, "but in this one, I don't think there was a real superstar." 
She says she has been "inundated" with calls and letters from agents representing winter Olympians but isn't currently planning to use any of them. 

   Certainly some American Olympians are doing well in the endorsements game, but industry executives say even they don't have the flawless looks and easy name recognition needed to propel them to advertising stardom. 
Gold-medal figure-skater Brian Boitano and speed-skater Bonnie Blair, who won both a gold and a bronze, are attracting the most advertiser interest, the executives say. 
Ms. Thomas could still end up being a bigger endorsement star than both, they add, if she beats East Germany's Katarina Witt in the world championship match in Budapest later this month. 

   Yet the American team produced so few medalists -- and so few of them with the charisma advertisers crave -- that advertisers are actually turning to the more personable losers and foreigners. 
East Germany's sultry Ms. Witt has had queries from a toiletries firm and a food company, says Mr. Blackman. 
Britain's Eddie "the Eagle" Edwards, who finished dead last in the ski jump, would be a "terrific" endorser, says Brenda Bareika, talent negotiator for ad agency Young &amp; Rubicam. 

   Canada's Elizabeth Manley, who unexpectedly won a silver medal in figure skating, is being considered by three U.S. companies for ads that would run in Canada and parts of the U.S., says her agent, Michael A. Rosenberg of Beverly Hills. 
Another of his clients, U.S. figure-skater Jill Trenary, didn't even win a medal but is still being considered by a hair-care line, he says. 
But he adds, "If she would have been on the (winner's) podium, it would have made a difference, realistically, of a couple hundred thousand dollars." 

   And Byrne Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago reports several queries about Dan Jansen, the speed-skater who fell in both races after his sister died on the day of his first. 
"Danny probably got the most exposure . . . for whatever reason," says his manager, Boston sports attorney Robert Murray of Murray &amp; Murray. 
Now, "he's a recognizable name -- and that is what is crucial to the advertising community." 

   But for Ms. Thomas, "a lot of (advertisers) are waiting to see what happens in those world championships," says her agent, Jay Ogden of International Management Group. 
He says that "there has been a lot of interest" from advertisers, but "there haven't been any firm offers." 
The figure-skater already appears in commercials for Campbell Soup Co. and Raytheon Co. that she made before the Olympics. 

   Byrne Sports, which lines up athletes for ads and speaking engagements, says that the only request it has gotten for Ms. Thomas is for an appearance at a trade meeting. 
"It would have done her well (in terms of endorsements) to have hugged her competitors, or acknowledged them," says Nova Lanktree, Byrne's director. 
"There was just a real shortage of human warmth -- and that's a real important thing" for advertisers. 
Mr. Ogden responds that Ms. Thomas showed "tremendous grace under pressure" that won't be overlooked by advertisers. 

   Mr. Boitano, meanwhile, made a Disney World commercial right after his medal-winning performance. 
But he hasn't yet chosen an agent and won't make more endorsements until he does, says a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Figure Skating Association. 
Moreover, while he has gotten one inquiry from a soft-drink company, most requests so far are for public appearances rather than high-paying product endorsements, industry executives say. 

   Indeed, the executives say that Mr. Boitano may never get the wealth of endorsement offers that, say, a gold-medal track star would. 
"When advertisers look towards a male sports personality, what type of image do they want? 
Machoism," says Mr. Blackman. 
"He might be perfect for a camera company . . . but he ain't going to do an after-shave commercial, and I don't think a beer company in the world would pick him up." 
He figures Mr. Boitano could earn $200,000 to $500,000 from endorsements this year if he wants but could have made twice that as a winner in a more "macho" sport. 

   Speed-skater Ms. Blair has also appeared in her first endorsement, a Bulova watch ad picturing her crossing the finish line, which appears in the current issue of Time magazine. 
Her agent, Jim Fink, says he is entertaining "five to 10" other endorsement offers, including financial institutions, food manufacturing, cosmetics and clothing companies. 
A copier company is also said to be interested in her because both are "speedy." 

   But while Mr. Fink says Ms. Blair may make some decisions as early as today, "we aren't going to get rushed into anything." 
He adds, "We're trying very hard to avoid the Halley's comet syndrome -- where you grab everything in sight and then you vanish." 
Of course, Ms. Blair may not even have that choice; Mr. Blackman figures she probably won't be able to earn much more than $200,000 from endorsements anyway, because her sport is so obscure. 

   Meanwhile, some Olympians wooed by advertisers before the Games have slid into obscurity after poor performances. 
Speed-skater Nick Thometz, for example, was predicted to win one to two medals but fell ill and didn't win any. 
"There had been quite a bit of interest in Nick beforehand . . . but the lack of coverage he got has hurt his (endorsement) chances," says Mr. Murray, the sports lawyer who represents him. 
"I think he'll do some appearances and maybe some promotional work, but I don't think there will be the TV commercials available to him." 

   Not that a medal guarantees attention, either. 
Pairs skaters Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard won a bronze, but advertiser interest in the duo is virtually nonexistent, industry executives say. 
Such apathy is perhaps fitting, however, following an Olympics in which personable non-medalists like Eddie the Eagle dominated TV screens. 

   "Winning isn't that important today," explains Carole Cohan, director of broadcast production for McCann-Erickson. 
"Last year was the year of the yuppie, and you had to be the best. 
Today things have changed. 
It's how you play the game."

Christopher Bowman or Todd Eldredge. And there couldn't be two more opposite

fishing for haddock off Cape Cod.;    But Eldredge, 19, has spent the last
five years in San Diego training with Coach Richard Callaghan.;    "Everything
is real different in California," he said. "I'm not the surfer dude.";   
Supporting Eldredge's skating career would be difficult for his family if it
wasn't for the Chatham Youth Hockey Fund. Eldredge said the town fund raises
money through dinner dances and clam bakes and has come up with as much as
$30,000 a year to help him.;    Bowman views Eldredge -- an athletic jumper --
as a jock, something he doesn't consider himself.;    "I hold the world record
as the only person to ever strike out at T-ball," Bowman said. "I don't see
myself as a super jock. It's not part of my mental repertoire."; HARDING FUN
FACTS: New women's national champion Tonya Harding was relatively unknown
before Saturday. Here's some background on her:;    (check) Harding won the
bronze medal in 1989 but didn't go to the world championships because the U.S.
sent only two skaters.;    (check) Harding skated at last year's nationals but
was suffering from the flu. Her lackluster performance earned her seventh
place.;    (check) Harding was married last year to Jeff Gillooly, who works
for the Oregon State Liquor Commission.;    (check) Harding has landed a
quadruple jump in practice but doesn't plan to keep working on it.; TRENARY TO
GO ON: Former national champion Jill Trenary, in Minneapolis to watch the
championships, insists she will continue competing through the 1992 Olympics.;
   "I still have confidence in what I do," she said. "You never know how
another skater is going to jump.";    But observers of Saturday's competition
concluded that Trenary, at least the way she skated last year, probably would
have won the bronze medal at best.; ETC.: Saturday was a day of upsets. In the
dance final, Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow -- dressed as Indy 500 race
cars -- won the long program, and the gold medal, bumping favorites April
Sargent and Russ Witherby out of first place. In the predictable world of ice
dancing, one couple rarely advances ahead of another.  </TEXT>

<P>
This is the moment for Natalie and Wayne Seybold. They intend to seize it -- 
and their first U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Seybolds are the top-rated pair in the country. After 16 years of skating 
together and seven years on the national scene, the brother and sister from 
Marion, Ind., say they are ready for their biggest season. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're the top-ranked team in the United States, and we want to come 
here and prove that and win a gold medal," Wayne said. "We've been junior 
national champions, we've been on the world team, the Olympic team, we've been 
second, third, fourth, fifth and ninth at senior nationals. We've won 
international competitions and things, but the one thing that's eluded us is 
the national championship. That's what this year is all about." 
</P>
<P>
With Olympic bronze medalists Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard now professionals 
and their prospective successors, Gillian Wachsman and Todd Waggoner retired, 
the Seybolds are favored this week. They begin competition Wednesday night with 
the original program and finish Friday with their free skating program. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens this year in Baltimore will affect what happens in the Olympic 
trials in 1992," said Wayne, 25, two years older than his sister. "It's just a 
fact, because you've got to have kids who are consistent, who are willing to 
train year after year and make their skating grow over the four-year period in 
order to have good representation at the Olympic Games." 
</P>
<P>
The United States had that at Calgary -- Wachsman and Waggoner were fifth and 
the Seybolds 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest foes for the Seybolds probably will be Katy Keeley and Joe Mero, 
and the sensational teen-agers Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo, who won the 
1988 world junior crown. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi also has surged into the rankings in women's singles. She will push 
1987 American champion Jill Trenary, who was fourth at the Calgary Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo will double up in singles but is not considered a challenger to Chris 
Bowman or Paul Wylie, who are rated even at the top of American men's skating 
now that Olympic champion Brian Boitano has turned pro.

<TEXT>     Jill Trenary, who appeared Wednesday night in the Tour of Figure Skating
Champions exhibition at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, doesn't like to reflect on
that dismal day last January when she was preparing for the U.S. Nationals and
World Championships.;    One minute she was gearing to defend her American and
world titles and the next minute she was laid up with a serious ankle
infection that knocked her out of both competitions.;    "The doctor said it
was a staph infection," she said. Trenary traced the problem to a cortisone
shot she received in her right ankle five years ago.;    "I developed this
blister on the ankle and then I noticed there was a small hole there," she
said. "It didn't give me any pain. I would just slap a Band-Aid on it and
skate. Then one night in January I went to sleep and woke up at 3 a.m. and my
ankle had a lump the size of an egg on it.";    Trenary was advised to have
immediate surgery to prevent an even more serious infection.;    There's
something inside figure skaters that allows them to handle adversity. Maybe
it's the nature of what they do, spinning and jumping, with quicks starts and
stops, blades flashing, and the omnipresent risk of injury.;    Trenary could
have moped in front of her television set, watching her friends go at it in
her sport's two major events of the year. Instead, she turned it into a
positive experience.;    "I don't really like to dwell on how I felt at the
time," she said. "Sure, I was disappointed. Actually, I had two surgeries. I
didn't skate for three months. But maybe there was a lesson to be learned, to
be watching rather than participating. It was difficult to be sitting on my
couch when I had planned on competing. But one thing came of it -- it
definitely motivated me.";    Trenary not only saw Tonya Harding capture the
U.S. title in March, she saw Harding do it spectacularly, landing the first
triple Axel -- a 3 1/2-revolution jump -- by an American in history.;    And
then she saw Fremont's Kristi Yamaguchi lead a U.S. sweep in the World
Championships in Munich, Germany.;    The American women's skating contingent
is loaded. And just breaking in, being competitive again, has become no small
achievement.;    "I'm taking it slowly," said Trenary, with a toss of her
Dorothy Hamill haircut. "I'm about 90 percent now. Getting back shape, getting
a feel for skating, took a while.";    To Trenary, it seems as if she has been
skating all her life. She was only 18 when she won her first U.S. title in
1987. The next year she just missed winning an Olympic medal, taking a fourth.
She was first in the U.S. again in '89 and '90. She added the world crown in
'90 and the U.S. Olympic Committee named her figure-skating athlete of the
year.;    "I kind of surprised myself when I won the Nationals in '87," she
recalled. "I remember when I finished my long program I felt I might win and I
thought, 'What have I done here?' That seems a long time ago now.";   
Trenary, who now is coached by Carol Heiss, a gold medalist in the '60 Squaw
Valley Olympics, has everything pointed at the '92 Olympics in France.;   
"That's when I want to peak," she said. "I'd love to win a medal. The color of
it makes no difference, just a medal. I came oh so close the last time.";    A
medal would be nice, but she won't cry if it eludes her. Life deals many a
surprise and Trenary has proven she can take whatever comes.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Tonya Harding looks the part of an aspiring Olympic figure skater with her
golden skate blades and outfit of pink and gold.;   She's effervescent when
talking about the music of her original program, "Latour," a pulsating
electronic number, which she skated Thursday night against rival Kristi
Yamaguchi of Fremont at Skate America at the Coliseum Arena.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BREAKING THE MOLD
HARDING NOT TYPICAL SKATER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Harding fell on her final jump, a double Axel she hasn't missed since early
in her career, and that put her second behind Yamaguchi. Saturday's 1 p.m.
long program completes the women's competition and counts two-thirds of the
final score.;   Harding talks about the image she wants to create with her
skating, an image crafted to please judges and public that's as important to
winning the gold medal as her trademark triple Axel.;   "I want people to look
at me for a full picture, not as just the triple-Axel woman," she says.;   But
the Tonya Harding behind the image is not the kind of 20-year-old woman the
public expects of a skater.;   In a self-conscious sport that considers a
married athlete semi-scandalous, Harding, of Portland, Ore., is just emerging
from a divorce that included charges that she was physically abused by her
husband of 15 months.;   She didn't finish school and doesn't plan to return.
"I've taken a business course and an auto repair course," she says. "That's
what I need.";   No. Clearly not the pristine Miss America-clone the ice world
loves.;   Better.;   This is a woman whose broken family never had the money
to finance her dream, so she accepted the donations of time and equipment from
her coach and others who saw a spark of toughness in twinkling 4-year-old
eyes.;   She attempted her first triple Axel -- a 3 1/2-revolution jump that's
the most difficult in women's skating -- when she was 14. Now she's one of two
women in the sport to have landed it in competition.;   She not only went
through a divorce in the past year, but she twice changed coaches, returning
to Dody Teachman after a bit of indecision. Yet she beat Yamaguchi for the
national championship and narrowly lost to her a month later at the worlds.;  
Discouragement, disaffection, distraction -- what's that?;   She's got a goal,
and it's the color of her skates.;   "I'd rather not talk about it," she said
of the divorce. Her husband had been her nearly constant companion for four
years before they were married. "It's over, and I'm really happy, and I just
want to talk about my skating. That's what I'm here for.";   Almost out of
sight, Teachman and a U.S. Figure Skating Association official are nervously
drawing their hands across their throats in a cut-off-this-interview signal.
This is not proper skating talk.;   But mere questions are no threat to
Harding.;   Didn't the turmoil of the year make skating more difficult?;  
"Absolutely not," she says. "My skating is the most important part of my life,
and I was not about to let anyone get in the way.";   In the way of the
Olympics, she means. The dream she refuses to dream. She can't -- doesn't --
imagine what they may be like. She never even has talked about them with
skaters who've been there.;   "No, I don't want to know," she says. "I want to
find out my own way.";   Cue Sinatra.; ETC.: In a fall-filled final, the
United States pair of Calla Urbanski and Rocky Marval moved up from second
place after the original program to win the gold medal. The leaders after the
original program, 1991 U.S. national champions Natasha Kuchiki and Todd Sand,
had three falls in their long program including one in which Kuchiki went down
and Sand toppled over her. They wound up sixth. Soviets Elena Nikonova and
Nicolai Apter climbed from fourth to win the silver medal, and Germans Peggy
Schwarz and Alexander Koenig took the bronze.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Kristi Yamaguchi was crowned the best women's figure skater in the world
Saturday, becoming the early front-runner in the race for an Olympic gold
medal next year.;    Exactly a month after a disappointing second-place finish
at the national championships in Minneapolis, Yamaguchi led a U.S. sweep of
the women's skating medals at the world championships in Munich, Germany, and
received the first perfect 6.0 score of her career. It was the first time a
country had swept the medals in the women's event at the world level.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yamaguchi, a Fremont native, not only defeated the talented challengers
from her own country -- including national champion Tonya Harding, who
finished in second place -- but also Japan's dominating skater, Midori Ito.;  
 "I'm excited and relieved," Yamaguchi, 19, said Saturday by phone from her
Munich hotel. "It hasn't really hit me yet.";    But it will. Winning the gold
medal in the pre-Olympic world championships will produce a year of intense
pressure for Yamaguchi, who finished sixth at the 1989 world championships,
fourth last year and dropped pairs skating last April to concentrate on
singles.;    "I'm not thinking about the Olympics yet," Yamaguchi said.;   
Yamaguchi, who skated a flawless short program Friday to put her in first
place, was the final skater Saturday but was unaware of how her competition
had performed.;    Ito, who had a bizarre mishap during Friday's performance
when she sailed over the boards that rim the rink, performed Saturday despite
suffering bruises. But she was still in pain and not her dominating self. She
fell on her triple-Axel jump attempt and performed poorly overall, finishing
fourth.;    Harding, who at the nationals became the second woman in the world
to land the triple-Axel, landed the jump again, but landed only three other
triples.;    Nancy Kerrigan, who like Harding was making her world
championship debut, won the bronze, equaling her finish at Minneapolis.;   
Yamaguchi came out and cleanly landed her first combination jump and two
subsequent triple jumps. Her next jump was a triple-Salchow, a jump that
consistently has given her trouble and the one she fell attempting in
Minneapolis. Saturday, she rushed the takeoff and turned the jump into a
single.;    "That was my only mistake," she said.;    Yamaguchi said her
confidence built as the program progressed.;    "Halfway through, I was
feeling pretty good," Yamaguchi said.;    The international panel of judges
agreed, save one judge from Australia who gave her marks of 5.6 for both
technical and artistic merit. Yamaguchi's other technical marks were 5.9 and
seven judges gave her 5.9 for artistic impression. But the 6.0 mark awarded by
the Italian judge stood out above the others.;    "I was overwhelmed," she
said of the perfect mark. "It's the only mark I can remember.";    Yamaguchi
said she didn't feel any more relaxed than she did in Minneapolis when she was
favored, but finished second to Harding.;    "It was pretty much the same
amount of stress," she said. "I was disappointed after nationals but I
realized that it was just one competition and the worlds were completely
new.";    After the nationals, Yamaguchi returned to Edmonton, Alberta, where
she trains, and studied videotape of her performance with her coach, Christy
Ness. She worked on improving speed and artistic expression, but still didn't
come to Germany expecting to win.;    "I'm surprised," she said. "I didn't
really expect to gain a world title this year, especially after the way things
went at nationals.";    Yamaguchi succeeds Jill Trenary as world champion.
Trenary did not compete in either the national or world championships because
of recent ankle surgery.;    Yamaguchi said she was thrilled with the U.S.
sweep, and thought it was a result of the elimination of compulsory figures
that have held back strong free skaters.;    "This is so great," Yamaguchi
said. "We have all worked so hard. I don't think the team can believe it
yet.";    After her triumph, Yamaguchi and her mother, Carole, called her
father Jim and brother Brett in Fremont, then attended the medal ceremony. An
international tour of world champions begins immediately, embarking from
Germany on Monday and lasting five weeks.;    While on tour, Yamaguchi will
work on the triple-Axel, which she hopes to include in competition next year.
After the tour, she'll come to the Bay Area for a brief visit, but won't have
much time to relax.;    "I'll start training again right away," she said.;   
It will be a busy year ahead.  </TEXT>

Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For days, Yamaguchi's picture has been plastered in local and national
sports pages. Videotape of Yamaguchi practicing is prominent on local evening
newscasts. Cameras follow her wherever she goes.;    "I can't do anything
about it," Yamaguchi said Wednesday. "I don't think I'll spend much time
thinking about (being the favorite).";    Yamaguchi, 19, clearly isn't
comfortable in the spotlight, except when she's on the ice. Press conferences
are more ordeals than routine exercises for her.;    But this week is the
initial stage of a year-long media barrage for Yamaguchi, the U.S. woman
skater most likely to medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville,
France.;    The last U.S. woman to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics was
Dorothy Hamill in 1976. In the three Winter Olympics since, U.S. women have
twice won the silver (Rosalynn Sumners in 1984 and Linda Fratianne in 1980)
and Debi Thomas brought home the bronze in 1988.;    By rights, Yamaguchi, a
two-time U.S. championships silver medalist, should have been able to postpone
the media scrutiny for at least a week. This national championships was
originally slated to be a Jill Trenary-fest, a celebration of the local girl
from Minnetonka, Minn.;    But Trenary -- the reigning national and world
champion -- was forced to withdraw from competition because of an injury. And
even if she was skating this week, Trenary may have been handing over her
crown after Saturday's finale.;    For the past two years, Trenary has relied
on compulsory figures to help her hold off talented young free-skaters, led by
Yamaguchi. But figures are now eliminated, and without them Trenary lost to
Yamaguchi at the Goodwill Games last summer.;    Yamaguchi also beat Japan's
Midori Ito -- considered the top free-skater in the world -- last fall at
Skate America in Buffalo, N.Y., positioning herself as the sport's
front-runner.;    Other women who begin competing today are happy to see
Yamaguchi don the weighty mantle of the favorite.;    "Let her have all the
attention," Tonya Harding told reporters last week. "Let me come in the back
and do it. . . . My jumps look different than anyone else's.";    Harding has
the most difficult triple jump -- the 3 1/2-revolution triple-Axel -- in her
repertoire, but has yet to land it in competition. Ito is the only woman who
has. But, even without that jump, the 20-year old from Portland, Ore., remains
Yamaguchi's strongest challenger.;    Two other top women, Tonia Kwiatkowski
and Holly Cook, have suffered setbacks in their skating. Kwiatkowski spiked
herself in her ankle earlier in the week, requiring stitches, but is expected
to compete. Cook, lacking motivation, recently gave serious consideration to
retiring, though she is the defending world and national bronze medalist.;   
But if Yamaguchi stands up this week, erasing the falls that have plagued her
in the past, she should win the gold medal. And the flood of pre-Olympic media
attention will begin.;    "It's been surprising," said Yamaguchi's mother,
Carole. "I think it will be an advantage being in Canada, being away from it
all.";    Yamaguchi trains and lives full-time in Edmonton, Alberta, which
will insulate her from some of the scrutiny. In addition, her coach, Christy
Ness, will keep a watchful eye on Yamaguchi's time.;    "We may have more
media attention," Ness said. "As long as it doesn't interfere with her
training time. That's what I'm there for.";    But Yamaguchi may need more
than her coach to manage her time.;    Several agents have contacted Ness
about representing Yamaguchi, though no decision has been made.;    One agent
interested in Yamaguchi is International Management Group's Kevin Albrecht.
Based in Toronto, Albrecht said he is from the firm that also represents
hockey star Wayne Gretzky and Canadian skater Kurt Browning, the men's world
champion.;    "She has tremendous potential," Albrecht said. "The camera
embraces her. Her personality and style and work ethic is evident and makes
her a tremendous package to offer.";    But it will clearly take some time
before Yamaguchi is comfortable with being neatly packaged and presented to
the world.;    Though both she and Ness attribute her recent success to a new
maturity, Yamaguchi still seems younger than most of the other skaters.;   
"It was just a matter of maturing, sooner or later," Yamaguchi said. "I guess
it's been later for me.";    But, ready or not, the future for Yamaguchi is
now.;  THE TOP WOMEN;    (box) Kristi Yamaguchi, 19, Fremont;    (box) Coach:

<LEADPARA>  It will take less than seven minutes.;   Fifteen years of Kristi Yamaguchi's
life, innumerable falls, dozens of routines, a gazillion sequins, and in 6
minutes, 40 seconds next February, all that time and effort will be put to the
test.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  YAMAGUCHI HAS TO DEAL WITH PRESSURE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A new Ice Queen will be crowned at the Winter Olympics in Albertville,
France. Will it be Yamaguchi?;   Perhaps, but whatever Yamaguchi makes of her
few Olympic minutes -- a 2-minute, 40-second original program the first
evening and a four-minute program two days later -- will shape the rest of her
life in ways both profound and petty.;   "From that moment your life changes
forever," said Sunnyvale native Brian Boitano, crowned Ice King of the 1988
Calgary Olympics. "A figure-skating gold medal is the gold medal of the
Olympics.";   Win it, and you're treated like royalty.;   "I don't want her to
know that," said her mother Carole. "I don't want her to feel that.";   Carole
Yamaguchi tries not to think about the Olympics, not even as her daughter
prepares for Skate America, the season's first international competition
beginning today in Oakland.;   It's no wonder Yamaguchi's father frets about
pressuring her. No wonder Yamaguchi has lived the past two years in sub-arctic
Edmonton, Alberta, another country and another world from where she grew up.; 
 Yet the day is coming when facing the pressure will be unavoidable.;   "Who
has the strongest nerves has the best chance," said reigning queen Katerina
Witt on the eve of her coronation in Calgary.;   Witt faced Debi Thomas, who
was in the position Yamaguchi occupies now. Like 20-year-old Yamaguchi of
Fremont, Thomas also was from the Bay Area. She, too, had moved away from home
to train for the Olympics. As does Yamaguchi, she began her Olympic year as
the world champion.;   On the climactic evening of the competition, Thomas
stumbled on her first big jump. Dispirited, she flubbed two more. The mistakes
occupied only seconds of her few minutes, but nine judges and a billion
television viewers saw them.;   Vulnerable to pressure;   Yamaguchi has proved
vulnerable to pressure. Heavily favored at the nationals last February, she
fell in her long program and finished second to Tonya Harding. A month later,
with the public's expectations for her considerably lowered, she won the
worlds and received the first perfect 6.0 score of her career. Harding was
second.;   Still, Yamaguchi is much less the focus of attention than Thomas
was in '88. She is but one of five U.S. skaters to win medals in the last two
world championships.;   In 1990, Jill Trenary won the gold and Holly Cook the
bronze. Last March, when Yamaguchi won the gold, Harding took the silver and
Nancy Kerrigan the bronze, the only 1-2-3 sweep by any nation in world
championship history.;   In the three pre-Olympic competitions on her
schedule, which includes one in Albertville in November and the nationals in
Orlando, Fla., in January, Yamaguchi will be no better than co-favorite in
any.;   "I think Kristi skates better when she knows she's an underdog, which
maybe every athlete does," Carole Yamaguchi said. "It's hard going in
favored.";   'She can handle it';   Men's world champion Kurt Browning, who
trains at the same rink as Yamaguchi, says people don't give Yamaguchi enough
credit for mental toughness. "She gets nervous," he said. "If you don't, it
means either you're not human or you don't care. She can handle it.";   The
pressure is already building.;   Yamaguchi's picture is on cereal boxes. She's
in ads for leotards, sunglasses, a macaroni-and-cheese manufacturer and brand
of bottled water. The family considered and then rejected hiring an agent.;  
Ted Turner's network has videotaped her lifting weights and driving her
Mustang. She and her coach, Christy Kjarsgaard-Ness, recently spent a week
hosting TV and press folks eager to begin their pre-coronation coverage.;  
More and more, Yamaguchi is taking responsibility for herself. When she moved
to Edmonton in 1989, she lived with Kjarsgaard-Ness and her husband 30 minutes
away in the Alberta farming community of Stony Plain.;   This summer Yamaguchi
and Danish champion Anisette Torp-Lind rented an apartment together near the
University of Alberta. They're learning things 20-year-olds learn, such as $25
per week is a bit tight for a food budget.;   "When we moved in I didn't even
have a bed," Yamaguchi said. "We didn't have anything to clean the house
with.";   '94 Games a possibility;   She says she may skate in the 1994
Olympics in Norway, taking advantage of this unique two-year interim between
Games to relieve the pressure of a once-only shot at the crown.;   She plans
to cope with the next six months of press and pressure by ignoring them or
turning them to her advantage.;   Thomas says Yamaguchi should not fear
either. "If you didn't have the press, you wouldn't ever be able to become
famous," Thomas said. "I don't think the press was a factor in me screwing up.
You're really responsible for yourself out there.";   There remains a giant
hurdle for Yamaguchi: the triple Axel.;   Triple jumps are the current
standard of athletic achievement by which women figure skaters are judged, and
Yamaguchi is one of the most acrobatic skaters in history. Although she has
seven triples in her long program, she is yet to land a triple Axel -- a
misnomer because it's really 3 1/2 revolutions -- but the most difficult of
all triples nevertheless.;   Trying to catch up; Japan's Midori Ito and
Harding are the only women to have landed a triple Axel in competition, and
Yamaguchi has spent more than two frustrating years trying to catch up.;   "I
know it's something I can do, but I don't know what my problem is," she said.;
  "I've been very close for a long time. I've landed it on one foot when it
wasn't quite around. I've landed on it with two feet. I just haven't landed it
clean backward on one foot yet.";   Browning, perhaps Yamaguchi's closest
friend and one of two men to land a quad (four revolutions) in competition,
believes she'll have the Axel by the Olympics.;   "She'll do it on her own
without the pressure of America, her friends and the media," he said. "She's
learned how to win."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  HERE IN a land without frozen neighborhood ponds in winter -- no ice, no
winter, no ponds -- ice skating and hockey nevertheless are popular sports
that are expecting a big boost in participation this year.;   The San Jose
Sharks open their inaugural home season Saturday night at the Cow Palace, the
first NHL team based in the Bay Area since 1976, when the California Golden
Seals left Oakland for Cleveland and its ice, winter and huge pond. And this
will be an Olympic winter with figure skating and hockey getting their
every-four-years media fix.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "In 1988 (the last Olympic year) we had kids coming out of the woodwork
trying to get into hockey," said Virg Erwin, president of the Santa Clara
Valley Hockey Association, which uses the Ice Capades Chalet in Cupertino and
the Eastridge Ice Arena. "When the Seals were here, we probably had 350 kids
in hockey and two all-girl teams. We're down to about 100 kids now, but we
expect to be back up to 350 in about 18 months (because of the Sharks).";  
There are six ice rinks in the Bay Area. Five sell Sharks gear in their
equipment shops -- "That stuff is really going good," said Dublin Iceland
manager Barry Keast -- and the sixth, Ice Capades Chalet at Vallco Fashion
Park mall, is located almost directly beneath the Sharks' own store.;   The
rinks typically operate 5 a.m.-to-midnight schedules to accommodate both
hockey and figure skating plus time for lessons. Even before the anticipated
new business, ice time is a bit squeezed.;   The Sharks will use Golden Gate
Ice Arena at Redwood City as their practice facility when the Cow Palace is
not available. But they will be just one of many youth and adult hockey teams
in the Bay Area.;   Golden Gate is the only rink without its own youth league,
although it teaches youth hockey lessons, but all six rinks have adult leagues
and two host college teams.;   Still, an increase in hockey participation
isn't all bad news.;   "It's going to be easier for kids to play because there
will be more teams here, meaning less travel and less expense," said Ron
Glasow, manager of Eastridge.;   There are at least five figure skating clubs
in the Bay Area, each buying ice time at one or more rinks, and they've
produced Olympic medalists from Peggy Fleming to Brian Boitano and Debi Thomas
plus world champion Kristi Yamaguchi.;   "The Olympics is what really gives us
a shot in the arm," said Bob Skrak, manager of the 51-year-old Berkeley
Iceland rink.;   Fallout from the Olympics and Sharks is expected to be felt
most strongly in the South Bay.;   Eastridge is more heavily used for hockey
at present with the youth association using parts of six days each week.
Hockey North America, a coed adult non-contact league, plays five per week
there and two sessions are set aside each week for adult pickup games.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SKATING; CHAMPIONSHIP; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  San Jose's Rudy Galindo, 21, finished 11th in the men's long program Sunday
and 11th overall at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.;    Galindo, who
had said his goal was to finish in the top 10 in the competition, stepped out
of his triple Axel but cleanly landed six other triples, illustrating the high
quality of men's skating throughout the top group.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Galindo, who split up with pairs partner Kristi Yamaguchi last April, last
skated singles at the national championships in 1988, when he finished 10th.; 
  Craig Heath of Mill Valley finished ninth in the long program and ninth
overall.; BAY AREA EVENTS: The next two major skating competitions on U.S.
soil will take place at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.;    Skate America, one of
the major international competitions, and the 1992 world championships will
take place in Oakland.;    "Skate America will have added significance,
because it takes place only five months prior to the 1992 Winter Olympics,"
said Joan Burns, co-chairman of the local Skate America organizing committee.
"And the competition will be a warmup for the World Figure Skating
Championships that will be held in Oakland in March 1992.";    Skate America,
the United States' only international, invitational skating competition, which
normally draws more than 70 competitors from about 17 countries, will be held
Sept. 16-22.;    The national champions get their choice of competing in
either Skate America or Trophee Lalique, which will be held in Albertville,
France, site of the 1992 Winter Games.;    Because the national champions --
including women's champion Tonya Harding -- probably will choose to go to
Albertville to get a feel for the Olympic site, it is possible that Fremont's
Kristi Yamaguchi, this year's silver medalist, will end up skating at Skate
America.; STILL EAGER: Brian Boitano, a Bay Area native and the 1988 Olympic
champion, was at the competition Sunday and said he still hopes that the
International Skating Union will allow professionals to compete.;    "If I
could, I'd skate tonight," Boitano said. "Who knows how I'd do, but I wouldn't
have anything to lose.";    Boitano said he is in great shape, because he is
performing triple jumps every night in his show with Katarina Witt, "Skating
II.";    "I'm still an athlete," he said. "When I skate with Katarina it's all
theatrics, but when I go out and do my solo numbers I fulfill my athletic
needs."; QUAD ATTEMPT: Men's skater Michael Chack attempted a quadruple jump
Sunday in competition. He came close but two-footed the landing.;    Only two
men in the world have landed the quad in competition: Canada's Kurt Browning,
who has done it several times, and Soviet Alexei Urmanov, who landed it in the
finals of this year's European championships.  </TEXT>

ENTERTAINING SKATER CELEBRATES MEN'S SINGLES CROWN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Skate America; Men's Finals  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Saturday night, after his men's singles-winning free skating program at
Skate America, he knelt down, kissed the ice, danced a jig and shot his fists
into the air in celebration. He may be the most entertaining skater alive.;  
Until a week ago in the NFL, that kind of joy would cost you a hefty fine and
5 yards.;   "It was very exciting, and I was proud of my performance," said
Bowman, whose home is Van Nuys but who trains in Toronto.;   "I'm an old (24)
and decrepit skater, and I was relieved because this was the kind of
performance I should have done a year ago in this event and at nationals and
at worlds.";   In climbing from second place after Friday's original program,
Bowman won his third Skate America in four years, tying Scott Hamilton's
record. He was second last February to Todd Eldredge at the U.S. nationals and
fifth at the worlds behind Eldredge's third place.;   Eldredge, fourth after
Friday's phase, took the bronze, skating a year-old long program he'll now
abandon to develop a new one for the Olympics. He put his hand down after his
triple flip, and a triple loop later in the program was wobbly.;   "I guess I
got a little anxious and tried to end the program before it was done,"
Eldredge said.;   Czech Petr Barna, who led after the original program,
dropped to second. He was fourth at worlds.;   Only Bowman, Barna and Michael
Chack of the United States managed clean programs of the 10 skaters in the
competition. Chack moved up from sixth to fourth.;   The Soviet Union's
Viacheslav Zagorodniuk, who held third place midway through the competition,
left the ice littered with golden sequins after flubbing five of the six
triple jumps he attempted with complete falls on the last two.;   Art and
sport collided head-on in the ice-dancing finals earlier Saturday, which
counted 50 percent of the final score in that event.;   The Soviet pair of
Tatiana Navka and Samuel Gezalean, fourth in their own national championships,
won the gold medal. Finland's Susanna Rahkamo and Petri Kokko, seventh at the
1991 worlds, won the silver, and French national champions Dominique Yvon and
Frederic Palluel, who were eighth at worlds, took the bronze.  </TEXT>

TRENARY GETS BIG LEAD IN COMPULSORY FIGURES; ITO DROPS TO 10TH 
</P>

DARTMOUTH, Canada

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Midori Ito dynasty that was predicted for women's figure skating might have 
come to an inglorious end Wednesday only one year after it started. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ito, who won the 1989 World championship as a 19-year-old, had one of 
the worst experiences with ice since the Titanic, finishing 10th in the 
compulsory figures at the Dartmouth Sportsplex. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time U.S. champion Jill Trenary, who seemed resigned earlier in the week 
to placing second behind Ito, won the figures, which count toward 20% of the 
final score, and emerged as the clear favorite to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Ito's technically superior freestyle skating earns her first places in 
the final two phases of the competition, she cannot win unless Trenary falls 
below third place in both. Considering the lack of depth in women's skating, 
and the composure the 21-year-old Trenary displayed last month in winning the 
U.S. championship, that is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last stand for compulsory figures, which have been eliminated from 
future competitions, and they went out dramatically. If they did not absolutely 
determine which skater will win, then they might at least have determined which 
one will not. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's Zeljka Cizmesija skated the final figure, for which she was 
honored with a bouquet of roses, a box of chocolates and a standing ovation 
from a crowd of about 400. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to determine whether to interpret the cheers as tribute to 
figures, which have been an important part of the sport since the beginning, or 
as good riddance. Johnny Esaw, the figure skating commentator for the Canadian 
Broadcasting Co., said he has three descriptions of figures: "Dull, dull and 
dull." 
</P>
<P>
But Ito threatened to make them exciting, almost stumbling on the second of two 
figures. One of the nine judges gave her 25th place, out of 29, for that one. 
Ito finished sixth on the first figure and 14th on the second figure for 10th 
place overall. She was sixth in figures last year, when she won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Midori was out of control out there," said Carlo Fassi, who coaches Trenary in 
Colorado Springs, Colo. "I don't know why. She can do figures. I think she was 
nervous. Last year, everything she did was wonderful. This year, there was more 
pressure on her." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, from Minnetonka, Minn., finished first on the first figure and second 
on the second to Holly Cook of Bountiful, Utah. Cook is fourth overall. Natalia 
Lebedeva of the Soviet Union is second, and Patricia Neske, who is from 
Hawthorne but represents West Germany because both of her parents are from that 
country, is third. Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif., is ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Fassi said the challenge facing Trenary is to maintain her concentration. He 
spoke as if the only one who can beat Trenary is Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little concerned," he said. "She likes to be the underdog, the one who 
fights for the title. She has to go out and attack. If she sits back, she could 
be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, third in the World Championships last year, said she will not alter 
her freestyle programs to protect her lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be deadly for me to start focusing on how big a lead I have," she 
said. "I came in here being the underdog. Everything I've heard is that (Ito) 
is totally superior to everybody else, which is easier for me to handle. I 
don't want to be the total favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Fassi said he and his wife, Christa, will do nothing to disturb Trenary's 
emotional balance. 
</P>
<P>
"We do nothing," he said. "We only stay away. We make no arguments. We'll tell 
her she looks wonderful, she has a nice dress." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, the Soviet Union's Viktor Petrenko moved into first 
place, but it took an exceptional original program, after judges gave defending 
champion Kurt Browning of Canada generous scores at the Halifax Metro Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Browning left out one required element and had a poor landing on a double axel, 
but he received high marks, including one perfect 6.0 for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
Petrenko then landed two triple axels and skated flawlessly. He received two 
6.0s for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, who trains in San Diego, moved into third place 
overall, barely ahead of West Germany's Richard Zander, who grew up in 
Huntington Beach. Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Either Petrenko or Browning probably will become the champion after tonight's 
freestyle program.

   When gold medal favorites Artur Dmitriev and Natalya
Mishkutienok take the ice today in the pairs competition,
they will be representing the last generation of Goskomsport
Olympians that the world will get to see.
   Rumored plans to convert ice rinks in the former Soviet
Union into giant meat freezers are just a bit of urban
folklore, but there's no doubt that days of the great Russian
figure-skating dynasty are numbered.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Say what you will about Goskomsport, the Soviet athletic
apparat, it located young talent, nurtured it, clothed it,
housed it, fed it steroids, and produced many of the greatest
figure skaters the world has known. A few of them were almost
too good. The legendary Irina Rodnina so dominated the sport
in her day, winning 10 world championships and three Olympic
gold medals from 1969 to 1980, that skaters from other
countries grew discouraged and either retired early or turned
pro.
   "Those who'll come after us will have nothing," says Mr.
Dmitriev, who with Ms. Mishkutienok is the world's pairs
champion. The two skaters are in first place heading into
today's freestyle program, having won the original program
competition Sunday.
   "For all sports it will be harder," Mr. Dmitriev says.
"Before there was a chance to eat normally at practices, to
get uniforms. But people have to earn money now. They can't
practice; they have to work."
   Mr. Dmitriev himself sometimes spends hours waiting in
line for bread these days. There are weeks when he goes
without butter, a rare find on this city's barren shelves.
"It's not that he's starving, but he eats almost randomly,
when he can," says his coach, Tamara Moskvina.
   Still, Mr. Dmitriev has a Japanese car, almost unheard of
for a 23-year-old Russian who isn't a gangster, and he is
planning to buy an apartment in the center of St. Petersburg.
Ms. Mishkutienok, who is 21, has her own apartment here.
   The two are classic products of the old Soviet machine.
Each entered the Goskomsport feeder system at age six, he in
the Russian polar city of Norilsk and she in Minsk,
Belorussia. Each received free skating lessons daily. "From
the large number of schools Goskomsport had, however poorly
organized, it was bound to get large numbers of athletes,"
Mr. Dmitriev says. "And from quantity, you'll always manage
to find quality."
   He himself wanted to be a hockey player, but he says, "My
parents, especially my grandmother, wanted me to be a figure
skater. That was a time when everyone loved figure skating
here, and my family thought it was a beautiful sport."
   In their teens, both skaters moved to St. Petersburg to
seek better coaching. There they were introduced and began to
train together.
   Unlike many skating pairs, Mr. Dmitriev and Ms.
Mishkutienok aren't romantically involved. Some believe that
a lack of electricity between them ultimately diminishes
their performance. "They're technically better than skaters
in the past," says Dasha Frebenetskaya, skating correspondent
for the newspaper Sovetsky Sport. "But because there's
nothing between them, they don't grab audiences the way
couples did before."
   But audiences themselves aren't what they used to be, at
least in the former Soviet Union. During the past year, Mr.
Dmitriev and Ms. Mishkutienok have been performing in nearly
empty arenas all over the country.
   "When you come out on the ice and there's no one there,
it's unpleasant," says Ms. Mishkutienok. "You don't feel like
skating because you're not skating for anyone. Our people
aren't at the rinks. They're in the stores, standing in
line."

WYLIE TAKES SECOND LOOK AT SKATING PRIORITY

Barely had Paul Wylie a chance to reflect upon or savor his surprising 
10th-place finish at the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary when he began to hear 
the sighs and whispers that presage the end of a career at sport's upper 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
And, although the Olympics had been his first major competition at skating's 
senior level and his finish was more than respectable, Wylie began to listen to 
the talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are really inclined to do that," Wylie said Sunday before the 
free-skating final at the Olympic Festival here. "People are living off other 
people's mistakes in this sport. You just have to live above that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how people are. I probably was like that when I was younger. They won't 
miss you as a skater, they see you as a notch out. A space for them to move 
into." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, 24, was tacitly erased from contention by some observers in the sport 
when he placed third at the national championships in February, thus failing to 
qualify for the U.S. team that was sent to the World Championships. In a sport 
based on subjective judging such as skating, it is simply that easy to lose 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Wylie chose to skate in this competition -- out of season and partially 
out of shape -- to proclaim his return and reclaim his place behind Christopher 
Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to skate here has proved to be a gamble. Wylie muffed the landing 
on the first jump in his long program Sunday and still managed to get a 5.9 (on 
a scale of 6) from one judge. However, that mistake was enough to give Mark 
Mitchell of Hamden, Conn., the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, who is from Denver and lives in Boston, was a distant second. Shepherd 
Clark of Atlanta won the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to losing ground to a younger skater, Wylie showed a vulnerability 
to judges, who will not likely forget. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, however, is determined not to forget what he is here for. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the media before the short program (at nationals) that it might be the 
last time I skated," Wylie said. "It was really awful. I didn't enjoy it. The 
questions still were there." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie reassessed his priorities after that competition. As skater Debi Thomas 
had done at Stanford, Wylie had steadfastly refused to cut back his class load 
at Harvard, where he is a second-semester junior. That stance has changed, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"My plans are to take my school schedule easier and make sure that I'm taking 
care of skating for the next three years," he said. "I don't know exactly the 
load I will carry but it will not be a full load. Before I wasn't sure of the 
priority skating held for me. I know that it does mean something to me." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie has been experiencing the dual guilt pangs associated with years of 
compromising his studies and compromising his training. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never practiced on a Wednesday, for example, because of school," he said. 
"To take one day off a week may not seem like a big deal. But I was skating 
five days a week and my competitors were skating six. There was a lack of 
continuity. I'd walk in Thursday and say, 'I should have been here yesterday.' 
There was guilt and there was a feeling of helplessness. I thought, 'When am I 
going to school?' " 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting emotions collided at the national championships last February 
at Baltimore, where Wylie admitted he was not prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that I could train and go to school full time and make the World 
team," he said. "I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie also experienced a singular moment during a performance when he failed to 
complete the first jump of a combination and -- because of pride and obstinacy 
he said -- he refused to even attempt the second jump. This, from a skater who 
molded a career as an expert and facile jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"In Calgary I missed the first jump in my program and the rest the program was 
way better," Wylie said. "That's what was missing, that tenacity and 
perseverance that I expect from myself." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie knew that some sort of change was in order. He said he didn't rule out 
quitting, but sought other solutions first. He tried new equipment, 
experimenting with all manner of boots and blades, finally going back to his 
old equipment. He took weeks off to refresh his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The change that seemed to click was a move at the end of June to train in Vail, 
Colo. with coaches Mary and Evy Scotvold. There he has stripped his skating to 
its basics and, in the process, discovered the joy he used to know. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me until Vail, until I saw the old jumps coming back," he said. "They 
weren't old, really, they were rejuvenated. I found how fun it is to do things 
well, how much I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to tell if the reconstitution of Paul Wylie is complete. It is 
too soon and figure skating is too unpredictable to raise hopes of even the 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
It is even too soon to report that the talk of Wylie being washed up is over, 
yet. All that can be said with any assurance is that he is no longer listening 
to anything but his inner voice. And he is happy with what he hears. 
</P>
<P>
Kristi Yamaguchi, 18, of Fremont, Calif., won the gold in women's figure 
skating, ranking first with all seven judges. 
</P>
<P>
"The program wasn't fully in, with all the choreography, until three weeks 
before this competition," she said. "I just wanted to come and try out the new 
program and see how it worked. I'm pretty happy with it, but I know I have a 
lot of work to do. 
</P>
<P>
Other gold medalists were April Sargent, of Ogdensburg, N.Y., and Russ 
Witherby, of Cincinnati, in ice dancing and Calla Urbanski, of Chicago, and 
Mark Naylor, of Harrisburg, Pa., in pairs competition.

Japan's Midori Ito proved again Saturday she is the best women's freestyle 
figure skater in the world. She may be better than any of the men, too. But 
Jill Trenary, a three-time U.S. champion, did not react well to suggestions 
that the gold medal from the World Championships should belong to anyone but 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"I won," said Trenary, 21, of Minnetonka, Minn. "I got the gold medal. 
Obviously, people think Midori is the best freestyle skater, and she is. But 
considering everything, I won. That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
It was a foregone conclusion entering Saturday's freestyle programs at the 
Halifax Metro Centre that Ito, the defending champion, would win that phase of 
the competition, which accounts for 50% of the final score. And she did. 
</P>
<P>
All Trenary, who was in third place in the overall standings when the day 
began, had to do to win the championship was finish second in the freestyle. 
And she did, becoming the fourth U.S. world champion since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Cook of Bountiful, Utah, finished third and Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, 
Calif., was fourth. Never before has one country had three finishers among the 
top four skaters in the women's freestyle competition. 
</P>
<P>
But all three Americans combined could not land enough triple jumps to compete 
with the athleticism of Ito, who performed six triple jumps, including a triple 
axel with hang time Michael Jordan would have envied. No other woman has ever 
done a triple axel in competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ito had the top score on all nine judges' cards in the freestyle program and 
received perfect scores of 6.0 for technical merit from three of them. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing wrong with her performance, by her own admission, was that 
it was not as demanding as the one she did at last year's World Championships 
in Paris, where she received five perfect scores. But she has improved 
stylistically, which has been her weakness. 
</P>
<P>
She still cannot compete in that category with Trenary, who did what she had to 
do technically, landing four of five triple jumps without a mistake, and did it 
elegantly, receiving six 5.9s for artistic impression. Every judge had her 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Ito, who skated earlier, left the arena in tears after watching Trenary, 
knowing her title chances were gone, but she did not begrudge the American. 
</P>
<P>
"If I fall on my jumps, there is nothing," she said. "Jill is doing something 
every moment." 
</P>
<P>
Except for Ito and Trenary, the quality of skating was not exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious program belonged to Surya Bonaly, 16, the French champion 
who had eight triple jumps and a quadruple in her repertoire. The only person 
ever to land a quadruple in a major competition is men's champion Kurt Browning 
of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Bonaly crashed on her attempt. She had one other fall, a slip and looked more 
like a gymnast. But the judges rewarded her potential with scores that gave her 
ninth place overall. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's program was not particularly enthralling as she performed only two clean 
triple jumps. But after starting the day in second, she finished third by 
default. At 19, she is the first U.S. woman to win a medal in her first World 
Championships since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, 18, had a program with seven triple jumps, difficult enough that she 
could have won a medal if she had skated well. But she fell on her first two 
jumps. Because she regained her composure after the disastrous start, she still 
placed third in the freestyle program. But that left her in fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Ito would have won the championship if she had finished ninth or higher instead 
of 10th in Wednesday's compulsory figures, which count toward 20% of the final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she won the original program Friday and the freestyle program, Ito 
could not climb out of that rut. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, who finished first in the figures and fifth in the original program, 
became the first champion since East Germany's Anett Poetzsch in 1980 to win 
neither of the free skating phases. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the compulsory figures have been eliminated, Trenary will have a 
difficult decision to make about whether to continue skating competitively 
through the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, or sign a lucrative 
contract with an ice show. 
</P>
<P>
If the figures were eliminated from this year's standings, the first three, in 
order, would have been Ito, Yamaguchi and Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Bob Trenary, said they hope to make the decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not whether she can win the World Championship again next year, it's 
whether she can be in front-running contention for a gold medal in 
Albertville," he said. "If she's got a 30 to 40% chance of winning, I think 
she'll stick around." 
</P>
<P>
Can she beat Ito in a free skating competition? 
</P>
<P>
"She's tough, but no one is perfect all the time," Trenary said. "She'll fall 
in practice like we all do. It's not like she's a robot, which is good. I won't 
make my decision based on one skater. It has to come from within, whether I can 
continue because I love skating."

YAMAGUCHI GETS MORE ICE TIME THAN ZAMBONI

Kristi Yamaguchi was out of bed to make the trip to Bountiful at 8 a.m., which 
must have seemed like sleeping in to her considering that she often is on the 
ice for practice by 5 a.m. No, it wasn't the starting time Wednesday that gave 
Yamaguchi that iron-poor blood look. It was the stopping time. 
</P>
<P>
After becoming the first woman since Margaret Graham in 1953 to win medals in 
both singles and pairs at the national figure skating championships last year 
in Baltimore, Yamaguchi, 18, was advised by some well-meaning people within the 
sport to give up one or the other before she burned out. Not only did she not 
listen, it's a wonder she didn't start looking for a dance partner. 
</P>
<P>
"She might look meek, but she has a mind of her own," said her singles coach, 
Christy Kjarsgaard Ness. "Don't let the quiet ones fool you." 
</P>
<P>
So Yamaguchi, from Fremont, Calif., has no one but herself to blame for the 
schedule Wednesday at the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
From 10:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., she was at the Bountiful Ice Rink for the 
singles compulsory figures. That meant she had to miss her scheduled pairs 
workout with partner Rudi Galindo of San Jose. Under the circumstances, the 
U.S. Figure Skating Federation made a concession, allowing them to practice 
immediately after the figures. 
</P>
<P>
After that workout, she began another for singles. A few hours later, she went 
to the Salt Palace for the opening phase of the pairs competition, the original 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"She can only endure this sort of nightmarish schedule because she has such 
great talent," said John Nicks, who has worked periodically with Yamaguchi and 
Galindo since the death of their pairs coach, Jim Hulick, in December. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, they won the original program. In second place, however, was the 
unexpected pair of Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park and Todd Sand of Thousand 
Oaks. Even if Kuchiki and Sand finish among the top three, they will not go to 
the World Championships next month in Halifax, Canada, because Kuchiki is only 
13. Sharon Carz of Playa del Rey and Doug Williams of Los Angeles were third. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yamaguchi finished fifth in the singles compulsory figures, a 
significant improvement over her eighth-place finish a year ago. With a skating 
style that belies her small body (4-foot, 11 inches, 82 pounds), she managed to 
finish second overall to Jill Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time champion, Trenary, 21, was first in the figures Wednesday. She said 
afterward she is more prepared mentally this year for a challenge from 
Yamaguchi. A clear favorite last year, Trenary left a news conference in tears 
after she won the championship because so much media attention was devoted to 
the ingenue. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Yamaguchi has a different role as a contender. But if there is more 
pressure, she doesn't acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
"She's detached, almost unemotional," Nicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that was her saving grace last year. After the World Championships in 
Paris, where she finished fifth in pairs and sixth in singles, her singles 
coach, Ness, moved to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi commuted between there and her home in the Bay Area, where she worked 
with Galindo and Hulick. But Hulick, who learned in 1988 that he had cancer, 
died in December. He was 38. 
</P>
<P>
"That was hard for them at first," Ness said. "Both of them felt he was always 
going to be there. When they actually had to deal with his death, it was 
traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
Galindo and Yamaguchi spent two weeks in December in Costa Mesa and a week 
earlier this year in Salt Lake City with Nicks, who was Hulick's pairs coach 
when he competed. But they also have spent time without a pairs coach in 
Edmonton, practicing programs that Hulick gave them.

   The Winter Olympics' flame, which was
lighted in Greece and traversed some of the most rugged terrain by
helicopter, dogsled, snowshoes and skis, was extinguished beneath a
nearly full moon in Calgary.
   With 60,000 people present, athletes from 57 countries marched
in to McMahon Stadium for Sunday night's closing ceremonies
carrying miniature Olympic torches. Banners reading ``Until We Meet
Again'' in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands.
   About 250 skaters took to the world's largest temporary ice rink
in period costumes depicting the history of figure skating as a
high-tech array of thousands of lights glistened off sequined
costumes, flags and flame.
   The skaters included past and present medal winners as well as
young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992 Winter
Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer Games.
   ``These have been wonderful games,'' declared Frank King, whose
title is chief executive officer of Calgary games' organizing
committee.
   For the United States, however, the Winter Games was the worst
showing in 52 years. Two of the six U.S. medals were gold medals,
won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed
skating. Blair also won a bronze in speed skating, making her
America's only double winner.
   The Soviets finished first in number of gold medals, with 11,
and total medals, with 29, a record. East Germany's athletes won
nine golds, 25 overall; while Switzerland's team came in third in
gold medals, five, and overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also did better than the United States in terms
of overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the
Netherlands.
   In 1936, the United States won just four medals, but only 51
were available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.

BOWMAN SUFFERS BACK SPASMS, TAKES A FALL

Christopher Bowman, who calls himself Hans Brinker from hell, spent a night 
there Friday. He suffered back spasms before going onto the ice and then skated 
one of the poorest performances of his career to virtually eliminate himself 
from contention in the national figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, the defending champion and runner-up in the 1989 World Championships, 
fell once, failed to complete his required combination jumps and then almost 
fell again. 
</P>
<P>
Only the generosity of the judges, who scored him high for his presentation, 
enabled him to finish as high as fourth in the original program, which is where 
he remained in the overall standings entering Sunday's freestyle competition. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Howe, medical director for the championships, treated Bowman for the 
recurring back spasms both before and after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a treatable problem," Howe said, indicating that Bowman could compete 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for his title hopes is less optimistic. For Bowman, from Van 
Nuys, to win, catastrophe would have to strike the three skaters who are ahead 
of him. Considering their performances Friday night at the Salt Palace, that is 
highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Eldredge, an 18-year-old former world junior champion who is from South 
Chatham, Mass., but has trained in San Diego for the last two years, added a 
victory in the original program to one Thursday in the compulsory figures to 
take a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
But a Salt Palace crowd of 8,479 gave its first standing ovation of the week to 
Paul Wylie, a 1988 Olympian and Harvard undergraduate, who finished second in 
the original program and improved from third to second in the overall 
standings. Mark Mitchell of Hamden, Conn., is third. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, 25, also received the first perfect 6.0 scores of the week, both for his 
stylish presentation. It was a significant improvement over last year, when he 
entered the championships as a co-favorite along with Bowman but finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned last year that nobody owes you a living in the sport," Wylie said. 
"You must go out there and make it happen every day. I trained ad nauseum, and 
it worked." 
</P>
<P>
This year, it was Bowman's turn to take the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It went through my head: 'The door is open; if you don't walk through it, 
you're dumber than anybody,' " Wylie said of his reaction when Bowman had his 
problems. "It didn't take any pressure off. I said, 'You've got to put yourself 
on the line and do it.' The short program is like the final putt. Everything is 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough sport. You hate to see somebody like Chris go down. He's a great 
skater. But, at the same time, that's part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has had three consecutive four-time men's champions, Charlie 
Tickner, Scott Hamilton and Brian Boitano. Bowman is not likely to add his name 
to that list. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes it strange," Wylie said. "Past nationals have always been more of a 
coronation." 
</P>
<P>
The king is injured; long live the king. Or perhaps it is more appropriate to 
call Bowman the chief. A flamboyant skater, he dressed Friday night in an 
American Indian costume, including a headband that, as one U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. official said, "makes him look like Tonto." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 22, has received as much attention for his off-the-ice adventures as 
for his performances, but he has proved himself as one of the world's best 
skaters. If he does not finish among the top three here, however, the USFSA 
will have to decide whether to still send him to the World Championships next 
month in Halifax, Canada.

<LEADPARA>  Kristi Yamaguchi, who twirled and triple-jumped her way to the 1991 World
Figure Skating title a month ago, returned to her hometown Saturday and was
greeted as a conquering hero.;    Hundreds of people gathered at the Southern
Alameda County Buddhist Church to herald Yamaguchi's appearance, her first in
the Bay Area since winning the gold medal March 16. As she stepped out of the
car, dressed elegantly in a black and white checkered shorts outfit, friends
ran up to hug her, huge flower bouquets were thrust in her hands and dozens of
camera shutters clicked.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I don't think in her heart she has ever left us," said Diana Shiba, who --
like Yamaguchi -- is from Fremont and belongs to the church.;    For the next
hour and a half, the community reveled in the 19-year-old woman who has gone
from skating in local competitions to becoming the best women's figure skater
in the world.;    A videotape of Yamaguchi's winning performances at the
championships in Munich, Germany, was played, and it elicited admiring gasps
from the audience. Politicians from Alameda County and each of the city
councils of the Tri-City area presented her with commendations, as did the
JapaneseAmerican Citizens' League and her alma mater, Mission San Jose High
School. Her family was introduced to loud applause.;    Despite the accolades
and honors, Yamaguchi was modest when she stepped up to the podium to thank
the crowd.;    "Winning the world title is history and I don't know what the
future will bring, but I know it's wonderful to be back home and see so many
friends," she said.;    She will stay in Fremont only a week before heading
back to Edmonton, Alberta, to resume her training, Yamaguchi said in an
interview before the ceremony. It's her first visit with her family since
Christmas.;    Today, Yamaguchi will perform in Santa Rosa with fellow figure
skater Debi Thomas as part of Children's Day Around the Bay. On Tuesday, the
Fremont Chamber of Commerce will honor her with its first-ever Distinguished
Citizen Award. Thursday, she will hold a press conference to announce that she
will skate in Oakland on June 12 in the Tour of World Figure Skating
Champions.;    Then it's back to her rigorous training schedule. Yamaguchi
said she is getting closer to perfecting the arduous triple Axel -- the one
jump that eludes her. She had hoped to work on it after the Munich
competition, but immediately embarked on a tour of European cities instead.;  
 The next year will be a busy one as Yamaguchi prepares for the 1992 Winter
Olympics. Her win in Munich boosted her confidence, she said, but she must
train hard to keep up the level of her performance.;    "I think I had a good
year," Yamaguchi said. But "next year it will be a whole new group of skaters.
It will be a whole new year."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   He didn't win the 6.0 scores that signal
an absolutely flawless program. But to figure skater Brian Boitano,
his gold medal-winning performance at the Olympics was the ultimate
``10.''
   ``This time, it was perfect,'' the 24-year-old Californian said
one day after he defeated friend and rival Brian Orser of Canada to
become the only U.S. Olympic gold medalist. The United States' only
other medals have been a bronze in the figure skating pairs and a
silver in 1,500 meter speed skating.
   ``For the first time in my life it looked better than it felt,''
Boitano told a news conference Sunday, after watching a video of
his triumphant performance. ``I'm usually so critical of myself
that I thought I'd see things I'd done wrong.
   ``Instead ... it was the first time I could say the jumps were
the best I've done and I could say, `Hey, what a good program.'
It's something you build for for years and when it happens ... it's
the ultimate.''
   Saturday night's dramatic ``Battle of the Brians'' capped 10
years of skating rivalry that saw Boitano lose the last two
meetings, at Skate Canada last fall and at the 1987 World
Championships. Each man selected his own military music and battle
colors _ blue for Boitano, red for Orser.
   Boitano, from the solemn opening notes from Carmine Coppola's
``Napoleon'' to the final seconds when he thrust his fist in the
air and wiped away a tear of elation, shone throughout.
   The four-time American titlist was first with five of the nine
judges, to Orser's four. Although they tied in points, the judges
gave Boitano the victory on better technical marks.
   Writing about his future for USA Today newspaper, Boitano said:
``It's kind of scary because you know your life is going to change,
and you don't know if you're ready for it or if you want it to
change.''
   Money, from commercial endorsements or other appearances, was
not the reason behind his drive to win the gold, he wrote for
today's edition. ``I'm sure I'll do some things with it, but it's
not why I treasure it.''
   ``It's going to be different when I go home. It's kind of scary
thinking about what it's going to be like when I get back to San
Francisco, wondering if I'll be able to slip in and out everywhere
without being recognized. I worry about privacy, about always being
on show. `Brain Boitano seen drinking a wine,''' he said.

   The Winter Olympics' flame, which was
lighted in Greece and traversed some of the most rugged terrain by
helicopter, dogsled, snowshoes and skis, was extinguished beneath a
nearly full moon in Calgary.
   With 60,000 people present, athletes from 57 countries marched
in to McMahon Stadium for Sunday night's closing ceremonies
carrying miniature Olympic torches. Banners reading ``Until We Meet
Again'' in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands.
   About 250 skaters took to the world's largest temporary ice rink
in period costumes depicting the history of figure skating as a
high-tech array of thousands of lights glistened off sequined
costumes, flags and flame.
   The skaters included past and present medal winners as well as
young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992 Winter
Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer Games.
   ``These have been wonderful games,'' declared Frank King, whose
title is chief executive officer of Calgary games' organizing
committee.
   For the United States, however, the Winter Games was the worst
showing in 52 years. Two of the six U.S. medals were gold medals,
won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed
skating. Blair also won a bronze in speed skating, making her
America's only double winner.
   The Soviets finished first in number of gold medals, with 11,
and total medals, with 29, a record. East Germany's athletes won
nine golds, 25 overall; while Switzerland's team came in third in
gold medals, five, and overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also did better than the United States in terms
of overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the
Netherlands.
   In 1936, the United States won just four medals, but only 51
were available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (8): Ice-dance favourites
return - Skating / Torvill and Dean and other top professional skaters are
back in Olympic harness this year. Sandra Stevenson reviews the competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The modern era has finally caught up with figure skating and the Winter
Games of 1994 will be considerably richer for it. Amateur and professional
classifications are no more.
This has brought back such audience favourites as Jayne Torvill and
Christopher Dean, Brian Boitano, Katya Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, and
Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev - all past Olympic gold medal
winners.
T &amp; D, as they are widely and affectionately known, brought Britain to a
halt on Valentine's Day 1984, when they won the Olympic gold for ice-dancing
with a spellbinding version of Ravel's Bolero. All nine judges awarded it
6.0 for artistic impression, which had never happened before or since in the
Olympics.
They are still regarded as the world's greatest ice-dancers ever. The
question of whether they can live up to that reputation a decade later was
answered when they won their seventh national title in Sheffield in January.
The judges gave their routine straight 6.0s for artistic impression, a first
for a British championship.
Also back in harness are the skaters who, in magnificent fashion, won the
1988 mens and pairs gold medals at Calgary, American ace Brian Boitano, and
Russians Katya Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov.
Boitano, now 30, suffers pain from past injuries and can only skate for a
little over an hour a day. He was second in the recent US championships but
still believes that skating in these Olympics is worth the agony he has
endured.
'Many people ask why I'm doing this,' Boitano says. 'I can't repeat 1988.
That was like angels were lifting me. But I still feel I can skate well and
don't want to reach 60 and be regretting that I never took the opportunity.'
Boitano, like Torvill and Dean, has faced criticism that he has had his turn
and is taking the chances of Olympic competition away from some youngster.
Boitano contends: 'I was never a believer in waiting your turn. If you are
good enough for Olympic selection, then you earn it.'
His fellow American, 22-year-old Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the 1992 womens'
Olympic gold medal, can't understand why anyone would want to lay their
reputation on the line after the door to the lucrative touring ice show
circuit swung open.
'I worked so hard all my life so I could win the gold and become a
professional,' Yamaguchi argues. 'Why would I want to go back and risk
losing it all? Albertville was an incredible experience but at Lillehammer
there would be many more expectations. I'd feel the pressure and it would
discourage me from performing my best.'
Her predecessor, German skater Katarina Witt - who won in 1984 and 1988, and
is the only woman since Sonja Henie to repeat an Olympic singles victory -
says it is the challenge that makes for excitement. Witt, 28, exclaimed: 'I
love a mountain to climb.'
One of the judges at the recent German championship said of Witt: 'For the
technical side, four triple jumps is just average. There are many others who
can do more. But for the artistic mark she is perfect. No other skater can
express her own personality so well through the music except Oksana Bayul
and Bayul is just a child compared to Kati.'
Bayul is a Ukrainian who won the world title at her first attempt last March
 -at the tender age of 15, the youngest since Sonja Henie in 1927. Witt does
not have the variety of triple jumps to match Bayul, Szewczenko or Surya
Bonaly of France, who was runner-up for the world title to Bayul.
Also in the running for gold is Nancy Kerrigan, if the American star is
fully recovered from the attack which prevented her from defending her US
title in January.
None of these rivals take Witt's come-back seriously. But she shrugs off
their dismissals. 'There is a place for me. Many in the audience cannot tell
one jump from another, yet they say my skating is so beautiful it gives them
goosebumps,' says Witt. 'This is what skating is about, not just the most
number of jumps.'
The other returnees are having an easier time than Witt. The 1988 stars
Katya and her now husband Sergei Grinkov had no problem recapturing the
Russian pairs championship at the end of December in which they beat the
current Olympic champions, Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev.
Mishkutenok and Dmitriev had taken a year off to work as professionals but
returned this season and in November trounced the Canadian pair who had
succeeded them as world champions, Isabelle Brasseur and Loyd Eisler.
Brasseur and Eisler, possibly fearing that their chances of Olympic gold are
fading, have strongly criticised the return of the professionals. Britain's
media have tried hard to coax Marika Humphreys and Justin Lanning to play
the same game. In November 1992, Humphreys and Lanning, aged 15 and 19,
became the youngest-ever holders of British ice-dance championships but lost
the title, and the one Olympic berth, to Torvill and Dean.
Lanning admitted he was disappointed when the news that T &amp; D were returning
first emerged, but that has been more than compensated for by the
opportunity the teenagers have had to train alongside their idols.
His partner said: 'When we won they didn't televise the event but this time
there was tremendous interest. That's great for skating and for us. And by
getting into the top three at the world championship, in Japan in March,
Chris and Jayne will earn Britain the right to enter three couples in the
1995 world championships which are in Birmingham.'
The reigning Olympic ice dance champions, Marina Klimova and her husband
Sergei Ponomarenko, are not returning and have been disdainful of Torvill
and Dean's decision. 'They do it for advertisement and promotion,' the
Russian Ponomarenko said on German television.
If T &amp; D win, their market potential will be enormous. No one has come back
to the top after 10 years away. Prior to their Olympic return, the pair had
been in the twilight of their career but winning will almost certainly
revitalise it. They will probably do another ice show tour through Britain,
Australia and the US. 'And if we don't win,' says Torvill, 'We just have to
be big enough to accept that.'

<HEADLINE>  HARDING IS SKATING'S TRIPLE THREAT
FIRST U.S. WOMAN TO LAND A TRIPLE AXEL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Pulling off figure skating's equivalent of a power play at last month's
U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Harding made history and stole the crown
off the head of Fremont's Kristi Yamaguchi. The 20-year-old from Portland,
Ore., became the first U.S. woman to land a triple Axel -- a 3 1/2-revolution
jump that is the most difficult of all triple jumps -- and won the national
title for her effort.;    "It was overwhelming," Harding said of her Feb. 16
performance.;    This week, at the World Championships in Munich, Germany,
Harding might continue to be overwhelmed. A relative unknown a month ago, she
is now legitimately in the medal hunt at the international level.;    With
Japan's Midori Ito -- the 1989 world champion and the only other woman in the
world to have landed a triple Axel in competition -- now expected to compete
this week, the 1991 World Championships could be the most athletic women's
event ever. (Reports out of Japan last month had indicated that Ito was
sidelined because of surgery on her jaw and would not be ready to compete.);  
 The big question is, can Harding duplicate her performance at the world
level?;    "She has been inconsistent much of her career," skating coach John
Nicks said. "She has proved she is the only skater that can challenge Ito in
pure jumping ability. But was this a one-time performance?";    Before
Minneapolis, Harding had been unsuccessful in four attempts at the triple Axel
in competition.;    "It was a big risk for her to take," said Jill Trenary,
who was sidelined with an ankle injury and lost the title she had held for two
years to Harding. "I take my hat off to her.";    Skating is often talked
about in terms of artistry and refinement and rarely in terms of guts and
courage. But Harding is a not-so-subtle fireball of a skater. Before
competition began, she confidently predicted that she could win the national
title, while everyone else was ready to concede the gold medal to Yamaguchi.; 
  But none of her fellow competitors was surprised to see Harding successfully
pull off the upset.;    "She's been working at (the triple Axel) a long time,"
bronze medalist Nancy Kerrigan said. "I wasn't surprised to see her hit it."; 
  Yamaguchi, who had long warned reporters of Harding's potential even though
Harding was still unknown, said: "I thought it was a wonderful jump.";    Over
the years, Yamaguchi had plenty of chances to watch Harding, who has been
competing at the national level for two years longer than Yamaguchi, and
became increasingly wary. Harding finished sixth in her first senior national
championships in 1986; in 1987 and 1988 she finished fifth, and she was third
in 1989 but didn't make it to the world championships because only two U.S.
skaters -- Trenary and Yamaguchi -- went in that post-Olympic year.;    By
rights, 1990 should have been Harding's year to break out ofanonymity. She had
beaten defending champion Trenary in an international competition and was
skating well. But Harding came down with a severe case of the flu at the 1990
national championships, and it developed into pneumonia. Doctors advised her
to withdraw, but, showing her gumption, she continued to compete. In the
final, she was painful to watch, appearing exhausted and able to complete just
one triple jump. She finished 10th in the long program and seventh overall.;  
 "I don't regret it," said Harding, who is a chronic asthmatic and whose
coach, Dody Teachman, leans over and tells her to "Breath!" as they wait for
her scores to come up after a performance. "I'd have to be on my deathbed not
to skate.";    Harding brings to skating a kind of popular appeal. She is the
daughter of a security worker, and her mother has made many of her costumes;
Harding's tastes run toward reading horoscopes, driving jeeps, playing pool
and eating fast food.;    At the national championships, Harding shunned the
classical opera and ballet compositions that most skaters favor and instead
skated to music a broad audience could instantly recognize: the theme from the
movie "Batman" and rapper Tone Loc's "Wild Thing.";    She dropped out of
school in the ninth grade and is the first national champion since 1962 to be
married. A year ago, she married Jeff Gillooly, who works for the Oregon State
Liquor Commission. When asked countless times how to spell her husband's name,
an exasperated Harding finally said, "H-A-R-D-I-N-G.";    It's a name worth
remembering.  </TEXT>

CHRISTOPHER BOWMAN IS A SHOWMAN, WITH OR WITHOUT HIS SKATES

It wasn't the greatest performance of his life. After all, Christopher Bowman 
once played a blind boy in "Little House on the Prairie." But it was good 
enough for a Tuesday morning interview with a few of the reporters here for the 
U.S. figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
To hear him tell it, life in Van Nuys hasn't been much different from life in 
South-Central Los Angeles. Or Beirut. Figure skating, he said, saved him from 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his friends, he said, weren't so lucky. Some of them, he said, looking 
reverently toward the ceiling in the Baltimore Arena, aren't with us anymore. 
</P>
<P>
But he was spared, he said, because of his parents' support. He said that his 
father worked three jobs to pay for figure skating lessons. And spared, too, 
because of his upbringing and service as an altar boy in the Roman Catholic 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reporters were enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
Others had heard Bowman's act before. 
</P>
<P>
When parts of the interview were repeated to some of Bowman's friends, they 
either laughed or rolled their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Meryl Streep playing Chris Bowman," said Olympic champion Brian 
Boitano, who said that he has visited the home that Bowman shares with his 
parents in a middle-class neighborhood of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Bowman has a flair for the dramatic is like saying that the sun 
rises in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he's on the ice or not, rarely is he not performing. He usually isn't 
during the compulsory figures, but who can blame him? You wouldn't ask Vladimir 
Horowitz to play scales. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's compulsories at the Mount Pleasant Arena, Bowman finished fourth. 
The only man considered to have a chance to beat him here, Paul Wylie of 
Denver, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
But it is in the freestyle skating that the true Bowman emerges. Although his 
workouts have been limited because of a deep cut in his left shin suffered 
during an exhibition in December, it is almost a given that he will skate well 
during tonight's original program and even better in Sunday's long program. The 
larger and more enthusiastic the crowd, the more important and pressurized the 
moment, he more he thrives. 
</P>
<P>
"When Christopher goes out there, it's like he's telling the crowd, 'OK, fasten 
your seat belts. You're in for the thrill of your life,' " said Frank Carroll, 
who coaches Bowman at the Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank. "That has made him a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 21, also was injured before last year's national championships, but he 
still finished third, behind Boitano and Wylie. That earned Bowman a berth on 
the Olympic team at Calgary, Canada, where he finished seventh. A month later 
at Budapest, he was fifth in the World Championships. If he is fully recovered, 
he could win a medal at this year's World Championships next month at Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll responded to a question about Bowman's potential by asking a few of his 
own, then supplying the answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he a terrific athlete? Yes. Have there been times when his performances 
have been the best in the world? Yes. Is he the most talented man in the world? 
Yes. Do I think he will be a world champion? That depends on Christopher. It 
depends on how much he's willing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman's work habits haven't changed much since he first began working with 
Carroll as a hyperactive 5-year-old. To get his precocious pupil's attention, 
Carroll found that he sometimes had to turn him upside down and drop him head 
first into a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
More questions and answers from Carroll: 
</P>
<P>
"Is Christopher an angel? No. Is he a coach's dream? No. When the curtain goes 
up, can you always expect him to give the very best he has in him? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly things I'd like to change about him. I'd like to change 
his ideas about how to train. We all want obedient students. But it's not 
always the obedient students who are the winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had kids who do everything I tell them in practice, but when they go out 
there for a competition, their legs turn to water. They literally tremble. You 
don't have to worry about that with Christopher." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, but how the U.S. figure skating community does worry about Bowman! During a 
telecast last year, ABC commentator Dick Button questioned Bowman's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman was furious, but Button hasn't changed his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of flak because I said he wasn't dedicated enough," Button 
recently told the Baltimore Sun. "It's strictly up to him whether he achieves 
things or not. The whole question is what kind of skating he does. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very talented boy. Is he a skater who will leave the sport different or 
better, or will he just be a hell of a nightclub act? He can win and not be a 
great skater or he can not win and be a great skater. It would be great for the 
sport if he put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll doesn't disagree with that assessment, but, at the same time, he 
doesn't believe the media have always painted an accurate picture of Bowman. He 
mentioned in particular an ABC "Up Close and Personal" feature during the 
Olympics that showed him at Venice Beach with roller skates on his feet and two 
women on each arm. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only day he went to the beach all year, and he came across 
looking like a beach bum," Carroll said. "It's not fair to paint Christopher as 
a fun-loving Hollywood flake. He is a very intelligent young man who has a lot 
of talent in many areas and a lot of class about him." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Carroll acknowledged that ABC didn't handcuff Bowman and force him to go 
to the beach with four bikini-clad blondes. "Christopher is a showman," he 
said. "Does he know how to work a room? Yes. He can size somebody up in five 
minutes and know what to say to make them dangle on a string." 
</P>
<P>
His personality, however, sometimes takes on more menacing overtones. On his 
final night in Calgary, he returned to the room he shared with Wylie in the 
Olympic Village at 4 a.m. Now able to laugh about it, Boitano said that 
Bowman's behavior was so strange that a terrified Wylie left immediately for 
the airport, fleeing in such a hurry that he forgot to take his skates. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul thought Chris was a demon," Boitano said. "They're good friends, but I 
don't think they'll ever room together again." 
</P>
<P>
On his left wrist, Bowman has a tattoo of a heart with horns and a tail. He 
keeps it hidden under his watch and said that he wants to have it removed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he is a practicing Catholic, is not involved in devil worship and 
that most of the other rumors about him are untrue. One that apparently isn't 
untrue concerns the high living that he and Soviet skater Sergei Grinkov, half 
of the Olympic gold-medal pairs team, did last summer during a tour stop in 
London. The Soviets sent Grinkov home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my problems, emotionally, physically and every which way," Bowman 
said. "The other things you hear, it's really a misconception. There's been 
things like, 'He's used drugs; he's a (cough) homosexual.' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is fueled by different things, by curiosity, by jealousy. There's 
a lot of gossip in the skating community. That's their inadvertent way of 
communicating. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've always been myself, an individual. That leads to mystery. Sooner or 
later, you have these National Enquirer type stories." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has ever used drugs, he said, "No, I'm totally innocent." 
</P>
<P>
There are so many stories about Bowman's rampant heterosexuality that no one 
would even bother to ask if he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a girl in every port, including most Communist countries," Carroll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bowman said that those stories aren't exaggerated, although he insisted 
that they are dated. "There are a lot of groupies in this sport," he said. 
"There was a time when I was younger that I took advantage of it. But I don't 
do that anymore. It makes it too difficult if you want to have a relationship. 
You have too much explaining to do when you get these calls on your answering 
machine." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that he is living with his parents since he moved out of a former 
girlfriend's house in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is believed that judges will, perhaps subconsciously, mark down a 
skater if they don't believe he represents the sport well, Carroll said he 
doesn't believe that Bowman's active social life will cost him points. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many men in the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.," he said. "They love 
to hear these little womanizing stories about Christopher. There is so much 
gossip in this sport about the men being gay. I don't think there are any more 
gay figure skaters than there are gay gymnasts or gay divers or gay anything 
else. But figure skaters hear it because they're in a performing sport. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's good for the sport for Christopher to have this image. Judges find it 
charming."

   Norway's Geir Karlstad fought through a steady rain and
sloppy track to win the men's 5,000-meter speed skating.
   Helped by an ice resurfacing immediately before he skated,
Mr. Karlstad's time was 6:59.97. He was the only skater to
break seven minutes.
   Falco Zandstra took the silver in 7:02.28 and Dutch
teammate Leo Visser won the bronze in 7:04.96. These were the
first Dutch medals of these Games.
   The weather prevented any of the skaters from even
approaching Norwegian Johann Olav Koss's world record of
6:41.73 or Tomas Gustafson's 1988 Olympic record of 6:44.63.
Mr. Gustafson finished yesterday in 7:15.56.
   Mr. Koss, a three-event world record holder and the
favorite in the 5,000 until developing a pancreatitis last
week, finished seventh in 7:11.32.
   Eric Flaim was the top American finisher in sixth place.
                                                                                                       

   CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING
                                                                                                       

   Vegard Ulvang of Norway became the first double gold
medalist of the 1992 Games, winning the 10-kilometer
cross-country race.
   Mr. Ulvang, who won the 30-kilometer event, overcame
breaking one of his ski poles near the halfway mark to beat
Italy's Marco Albarello by 19.2 seconds. The winning time was
27:36.0. Christer Majback of Sweden finished third.
   Meanwhile, Marjut Lukkarinen won the women's
five-kilometer event, Finland's third consecutive triumph in
the sprint.
   Ms. Lukkarinen edged Lyubov Egorova of the United Team by
0.9 second, reversing the finish of Sunday's 15-kilometer
race. Ms. Lukkarinen's time yesterday was 14:13.8.
   Elena Valbe of the United Team, third in the 15K race,
again won the bronze.
   Both races are part of a two-day pursuit, a new Olympic
event. The men will ski a 15-kilometer freestyle race
tomorrow, while the women will ski 10 kilometers. Starting
times will be staggered to reflect yesterday's finish.
                                                                                                       

   FIGURE SKATING
                                                                                                       

   Victor Petrenko of the United Team won the men's original
program, using the same routine judged best at the past two
world championships.
   And with three-time world champion Kurt Browning of Canada
pacing fourth, the 22-year-old Ukranian is in excellent
position to win the Olympic title. For Mr. Browning to win
Canada's first Olympic men's title, he would have to win the
free skate tomorrow night and have Mr. Petrenko, runner-up in
the world championships, finish lower than second.
   Petr Barna of Czechoslovakia was second after the original
program, while American Paul Wylie stood third.
   Christopher Bowman, the American champion, was seventh
after a lackluster performance. Todd Eldredge, attempting to
overcome back problems, struggled to wind up ninth.
                                                                                                       

   MOGULS
                                                                                                       

   Donna Weinbrecht of the U.S., a twotime world champion,
took the first-ever freestyle skiing gold medal.
   Elizaveta Kojevnikova of the United Team won the silver
and Norway's Stine Hattestad took the bronze.
   Ms. Weinbrecht skiied next to last. The final skier was
Raphaelle Monod of France, the winner of Wednesday's
preliminary heat. But Ms. Monod slipped about 40 yards from
the finish, ending last of the eight finalists.
   In the men's competition, Edgar Grospiron won the gold,
beating out fellow Frenchman Olivier Allamand, who took the
silver and American Nelson Carmichael, who took the bronze.
                                                                                                       

   COMBINED SLALOM
                                                                                                       

   Austria's Petra Kronberger won the gold medal in the
women's combined, keeping teammate Anita Wachter from
becoming the first Alpine skier to retain an Olympic title.
   Florence Masnada of France won the bronze.
   American Krista Schmidinger, second in the downhill,
struggled to a 14th-place finish in the slalom and was 11th
overall.
                                                                                                       

   HOCKEY
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. clinched a berth in the medal round, beating
Finland 4-1 Thursday behind goalie Ray LeBlanc's second
outstanding game and Scott Young's two goals.
   Mr. LeBlanc stopped 24 shots against Finland. His shutout
streak was stopped at 110 minutes and 57 seconds.
   Italy moved to 1-2, beating Poland 7-1, which has lost all
three of its games.
                                                                                                       

   BOBSLED
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. two-man bobsled team of Herschel Walker and Brian
Shimer had the best combined time in Wednesday's training,
completing two runs in 2:01.95. But yesterday, before
training runs were halted because of snow, their time was
11th best.
   Meanwhile, Janis Kipurs of Latvia, the defending Olympic
champion in the two-man bobsled, and 1988 silver medalist
Wolfgang Hoppe of Germany will not compete in this weekend's
race, their teams said.
   Mr. Kipurs strained a calf muscle during warmups Wednesday
and will not enter the two-man race; he likely will race in
the four-man event.
   Mr. Hoppe suffered a hamstring strain five weeks ago, and
then lost a two-heat German race-off Wednesday when he was
slow getting into his sled.

SAND, KUCHIKI MAKE A POINT DESPITE SCORE; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: AREA TEAM GAINS CONFIDENCE AND EXPERIENCE BUT FAILS TO IMPRESS 
JUDGES IN A CROWD-PLEASING RETURN TO THE ICE.

<P>
Todd Sand has been feeling a little better lately. As a result, Natasha 
Kuchiki, his figure skating partner, is feeling a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the top pairs team in the United States trailed three Soviet 
couples when results of the original program were tabulated Thursday at the 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
The scores will come later, after the international judging community gets used 
to the relatively new top team from the United States. That probably won't 
happen soon enough to help Sand and Kuchiki in the Goodwill Games -- the 
competition concludes today with the free-skating program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to establish ourselves as one of the top teams in the 
world," Sand said after the pair's marks had been taken off the board and a 
crowd of 17,429 at the Tacoma Dome stopped jeering. 
</P>
<P>
Had the judges been aware of the trials faced by Sand and Kuchiki in the past 
months, perhaps they would have been more generous. 
</P>
<P>
Sand, of Thousand Oaks, and Kuchiki, from Canoga Park, have been in full 
training for only two weeks. They were scheduled to compete at the U. S. 
Olympic Festival in Minneapolis last month, but were forced to withdraw at the 
last minute because Sand was experiencing lower-back problems. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors suggested plenty of rest. Not exactly a prescription for figure skating 
success with a major international competition a month away. 
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Sand told Kuchiki he was starting to feel like his old self, a 
comment she said "relieved" her. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, his performance spoke for itself. The couple's performance had a 
minor flaw or two, but nothing noticeable to the crowd, which roared its 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little nervous going in, but once I started skating, I forgot about 
it," Kuchiki said. "The crowd was great." 
</P>
<P>
And, on this day, that was enough of a reward. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd knew it was a fine performance," said John Nicks, who coaches the 
pair. "We were a little disappointed in the marks, but this is still a new 
pair. Once they perform like this two or three more times in front of an 
international judging body, then we'll see those numbers go up. We're very 
happy about what happened here today." 
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games mark only the second international competition for Sand, 26, 
and Kuchiki, 13, who joined forces a little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
After only eight months together, they placed second in the U.S. championships 
at Salt Lake City in February. 
</P>
<P>
In March, they placed 11th at the world championships in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
The following month, they became No. 1 -- in the United States, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Rudi Galindo and Kristi Yamaguchi, national pairs champions, separated to 
pursue singles careers. Inheriting the top spot added some pressure, Kuchiki 
said, but Nicks, who used to coach world champions Randy Gardner and Tai 
Babilonia, is confident the couple will prove that is where they belong. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still learning, but I think it was obvious today that they're becoming 
much more comfortable together," Nicks said. "They're starting to look like 
what I would call a seasoned pair of competitors." 
</P>
<P>
In the singles, Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys was sixth among eight 
competitors in the men's scoring. It is a humbling position for the 1989 
national champion, but one he said he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"When you miss a combination, that's what happens," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman's exercise was to include a triple-lutz followed by a double-toe loop. 
Instead, he performed a single-lutz and double-toe loop. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is new and still in the development stages," Bowman said. "I've 
had trouble with it." 
</P>
<P>
Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union, who was second in the world championships, 
leads going into today's free-skating portion of the competition.

<LEADPARA>  A YEAR before the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, organizers are
wishing they had driven a harder bargain for U.S. television rights.;   
Construction problems with the combination bobsled-luge run and ski jumps are
primarily responsible for an estimated $320 million deficit, raising the total
cost of the Games to $780 million.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CBS GETTING A BARGAIN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Olympics
Olympic Report
Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The largest single source of revenue, CBS Sports' $243 million rights fee,
was negotiated in U.S. dollars, which have been shrinking in value compared to
the French franc, the currency in which the Albertville organizing committee
pays its bills.;    "Our goal is to break even," Michel Barnier, co-president
of the organizing committee, told the Associated Press. "It will be difficult,
but possible.";    CBS, meanwhile, believes it will be getting a bargain,
because it cost ABC $309 million for the rights to the 1988 Calgary Olympics,
and the network lost a reported $65 million on the deal.;  EARLY DECISION: The
U.S. bobsled team will enter three sleds in the two-man competition at the
Albertville Olympics, and San Josean Brian Richardson is one of six men who
still have a chance to drive one.;    Richardson, 35, and his brakeman, Tyrone
Jones of Maryland, will compete in Lake Placid, N.Y., against the five other
sleds March 9-11 for one of the three berths. It's the earliest U.S. Olympic
trial for any of the 10 winter sports.;    Richardson, a Cal graduate and an
engineering consultant, has been driving sleds for seven years. In a four-race
trials qualifying series composed of eight heats earlier this month in Lake
Placid, Richardson had a fifth, two seconds and a first. That placed him
second overall among 11 sleds. The top three sleds advanced to the trials.;   
The other three sleds in the trials are the U.S. sleds that have been
competing this winter in Europe. Brian Shimer of Naples, Fla., driver of the
No. 1 sled with brakeman/hurdler Edwin Moses, was seventh in the world
championships, the best U.S. finish in eight years.;  SULLIVAN CANDIDATES: USA
Wrestling is lobbying hard for John Smith of Stillwater, Okla., to be given
the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur athlete.;    Smith is
the favorite among 10 nominees for the award, which is to be announced March
11. It's his fourth nomination, and he'd be the first wrestler to win the
award, established in 1930. His 1990 freestyle world championship at 136 1/2
pounds was his fourth straight world or Olympic title. Earlier this year he
was named the U.S. Olympic Committee's SportsMan of the year.;    The other
Sullivan nominees are swimmer Mike Barrowman, speed skater Bonnie Blair,
basketball player Teresa Edwards, boxer Eric Griffin, football player Raghib
Ismail, runner Lynn Jennings (the USOC's SportsWoman of the year), pentathlete
Lori Norwood, figure skater Jill Trenary and freestyle skier Donna
Weinbrecht.;  SHUTOUT SNAPPED: No U.S. alpine skier had placed in a World Cup
race all winter until Eva Twardokens of Santa Cruz won the silver in the last
women's race, a giant slalom Feb. 10 in Zwiesel, Germany.;    Twardokens led
after the first of two runs but was beaten in the second by Austria's Anita
Wachter, who won the event by 0.87 seconds. With three giant slaloms remaining
on the schedule, all in North America, Twardokens has a chance for a top-three
finish for the G.S. season. She's currently fourth, eight points behind Petra
Kronberger of Austria.;    Nancy Fiddler of Crowley Lake was the best U.S.
finisher in the World Nordic Ski Championships in Val diFiemme, Italy, with a
19th in the 15-kilometer classic race.;    The U.S. freestyle team led all
nations with seven medals, three gold, in the world championships last week in
Lake Placid. Freestyle skiing will be a full Olympic event for the first time
in Albertville.;  ETC.: Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont and her expected rival for
the women's figure skating gold medal in '92, Japan's Midori Ito, are among
those who will skate in the Tour of World Figure Skating Champions on June 12
at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. The 30-city tour also will include past Olympic
and world champions Peggy Fleming, Robin Cousins, Brian Orser and ice dancers
Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko. Tickets are on sale for $35 and $22.50.

<HEAD>America's Showing Worst In 52 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when
the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent
Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed
skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
   The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games
showing in 52 years. Two of the six were gold medals, won by Brian
Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating. Blair
also won a bronze in speed skating, making her America's only
double winner.
   The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing
ceremony before 60,000 people in McMahon Stadium. The 250 figure
skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as
well as young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992
Winter Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer
Games.
   Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, and
banners reading ``Until We Meet Again'' in eight languages were
draped along the top of the stands.
   Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missed
winning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they was
beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.
   Van Gennip took more than six seconds off her own world record
in the 5,000 meters to win her third gold medal. American Mary
Docter was 22.87 seconds behind. East Germans finished 2-3 in the
race.
   Finland won the hockey silver medal, handing the Soviets their
first loss of the Games, 2-1. The Soviets clinched the gold medal
Friday night, and America finished seventh for the second straight
time.
   In 1936, America won just four medals, but only 51 were
available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.
   The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, with
11, and total medals, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics.
East Germany's athletes won nine golds, 25 overall; while
Switzerland's team came in third in both gold medals, five, and
overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also bested the United States in terms of
overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.

ITO DOESN'T LEAVE FOES JUMPING FOR JOY;

FIGURE SKATING: HER ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRIPLE AXELS PUTS EXUBERANT JAPANESE 
AMONG FEMALE ELITE.

<P>
Her dynamic performance in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, combined with 
the elimination of compulsory figures after 1990, made it inevitable that 
Japan's Midori Ito some day would rule women's figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. champion Jill Trenary knew the best she could hope for before last 
year's World Championships in Paris was that Ito's rise would be gradual 
instead of immediate. 
</P>
<P>
As the fourth-place finisher in Calgary behind three retiring medalists, 
Katarina Witt, Elizabeth Manley and Debi Thomas, Trenary was expected to 
inherit the title in Paris. Her expertise in figures, in contrast with Ito's 
haphazard etchings, was supposed to be her edge. 
</P>
<P>
But Ito, who was performing triple jumps as a 6-year-old in Japan, does nothing 
gradually. Trenary knew her cause was lost as soon as she saw her 4-foot-9, 
97-pound rival on the ice. Trenary acknowledged this week that she was 
intimidated by Ito, which she said accounted, at least in part, for her flawed 
freestyle performances and a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in awe," said Trenary, who shared practice time with Ito. "I didn't 
expect her to be as good as she was." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Trenary, she was not assigned to Ito's practice group for this 
year's World Championships, which begin today for the women with compulsory 
figures. But she said it would not have made much difference if she had been. 
She came here expecting the worst, which means Ito's best. 
</P>
<P>
"I've accepted it," Trenary said. "She's very talented." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary's coach, Carlo Fassi, said her only hope to beat Ito if both skate 
their best would be for the judges to reverse the trend of recent years in 
scoring and reward aesthetics instead of athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
This will not be good news for Trenary, but Ito, 20, claimed at a news 
conference Monday night that she has improved artistically. Until now, her 
reputation has been based solely on her jumping ability, which she said came 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child, I felt I could master some of the jumps quicker than the other 
children," she said through an interpreter. "Jumps that would take them three 
hours to learn took me an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
As an 11-year-old in the World Junior Championships, she completed three triple 
jumps. Last year, she became the first woman to perform the most difficult 
triple jump, the axel, in competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the challenge was the triple axel," she said. "Since I can do that 
now, this year I am trying to do more for artistic impression." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, she has been taking ballet lessons. Although her coach, Machiko 
Yamada, choreographed the freestyle program in the past, that duty fell this 
year to Ito's ballet teacher. 
</P>
<P>
But asked what it is about her skating that so excites crowds, she smiled and 
said, "Jumps." 
</P>
<P>
While other women -- the United States' Elaine Zayak, for example -- have built 
their programs around jumps, it is only since Ito emerged that it seems to have 
become required in order to impress international judges. Skaters who have 
followed Ito's lead include Californian Kristi Yamaguchi, second in the 
national championships to Trenary the last two years, and France's Surya 
Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
Bonaly, 16, is a former gymnast who already is practicing quadruple jumps, 
which have been performed in a major competition by only one man, world 
champion Kurt Browning of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys, runner-up in last year's world championships, 
compares Ito to Browning. 
</P>
<P>
"Ito is fearless, and Kurt Browning has a lot of that quality," he said. "If 
they thought they could climb up on top of the rafters and jump off with their 
skates on, do six revolutions and have a chance of surviving, they would do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the trend, which they say was encouraged by the impending 
elimination of compulsory figures, fear it will increase the potential for 
injuries, particularly in young girls. 
</P>
<P>
Ito suffered an injured left ankle on a triple jump last May and has to have it 
heavily taped before going onto the ice. She said her own experimentation with 
quadruple jumps will be postponed until her ankle improves. 
</P>
<P>
For now, she is content to have seven triple jumps in her freestyle program. 
Her only problem in practice has been that the ice at the Halifax Metro Centre 
is barely large enough to contain her. On triple axels, she comes perilously 
close to crashing into the boards. Officials of the International Skating Union 
said the ice meets their minimum requirements but added that the increased 
emphasis on jumping might force them to revise their standards. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Nagoya, a city of 2 million, Ito was accomplished enough by age 4 to 
skate to the center of the ice rink and ask Yamada to coach her. Two years 
later, after her parents separated, she moved in with Yamada's family and has 
lived there since. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, she accepted me as one of her children," Ito said. "So I didn't 
feel that I was a hardship for her." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Ito divulges few details of her personal life. Her parents still 
live in Nagoya, but she said she keeps in touch with them primarily by 
telephone. She said her father is a businessman. Asked what kind, she said, "A 
regular businessman." 
</P>
<P>
She recently graduated in home economics from a two-year school, Tokai Gakuen 
Girls College, and soon will begin work for a large Japanese company, Prince 
Hotels, although she said she has not yet been informed of her job's 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
One of Japan's most popular athletes -- "I am not even able to go to the 
doughnut shop with my friends without being recognized" -- she recently 
received the ultimate honor in her country, an invitation to visit Emperor 
Akihito in his palace. 
</P>
<P>
She does not seem to have been affected by her fame. As exuberant as ever on 
the ice, Ito once was described as "a smile attached to wings." After 
particularly difficult jumps, she pumps a fist in the air. That is not typical 
of Japanese athletes, who usually are stoic while competing, but her coach quit 
trying years ago to change her. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to discipline, however, she is very Japanese. After finishing 
sixth last year in figures, which account for 20% of the final score, she had 
to win both freestyle programs to become the champion. In an attempt to 
improve, she said she has spent two-thirds of her practice time this year on 
the tedious tracings. That does not mean she has acquired a love for them, but 
she puts her head down and carries on. 
</P>
<P>
"Compulsories," she said, "are compulsory."

   Canada's three-time world champion Kurt Browning is the
favorite as the men's figure skating begins tonight on CBS,
but U.S. contenders Christopher Bowman, 24, from Los Angeles
and Todd Eldredge, 20, from San Francisco will be in the
medal chase. Other highlights will include the entertaining
new Olympic sport freestyle skiing.
                                                                                                       

   A Large Audience
   CBS continues to score in A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings. On
Tuesday, it attracted 23.5% of U.S. homes with TV sets,
according to preliminary figures. ABC was second with 16.4%
and NBC lagged behind with 10.9%.
   The Games also are good news for TNT, the first cable
network to broadcast portions of the Olympics: On Monday, TNT
received 2.1%; normally it gets a 0.8%.
                                                                                                       

   Kudos for Hamilton
                                                                                                       

   Of all the CBS people broadcasting from the Games, kudos
must go to figure-skating analyst Scott Hamilton. He is
well-prepared and informative. His pairing with Verne
Lundquist is a wise one.
   What we could do without are the endless set-up pieces
before a sport is broadcast. Did we really need a piece over
five minutes in length from Charles Kuralt about mothers of
athletes who sit near one another in the stands?
