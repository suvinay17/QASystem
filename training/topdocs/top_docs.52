   West German computer hackers have
stolen data that provides access to key military and research
computers in the West and passed that information to the Soviets,
officials and news reports said.
   A West German television network on Thursday said passwords,
codes and other information came from computers in the United
States, Western Europe and Japan. West Germany prosecutors said
three people were arrested, and a TV network said at least 10
computer hackers were involved in the spy ring.
   The Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network said among the
computers was the U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known
as Optimus; a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer; and
computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.
   The network said attempts were made to gain access to the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, which
it called a key link in efforts to break into other U.S. computers.
   Clifford Stoll, an astrophysicist who did research at the
laboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken into
through an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not have
passwords for classified information.
   ``We were amazed! Here's some guy breaking into an astronomy
computer in Berkeley, reaching out into military computers trying to
search for information about SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as ``Star Wars''), about nuclear warheads,'' Stoll said in a
telephone interview Thursday from his home in Cambridge, Mass.
   Stoll, who works at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at
Harvard University, said he and other researchers helped break the
spy ring by providing false information. He said someone linked to
East bloc groups wrote the laboratory asking for related
information, leading authorities to crack the ring. He did not
elaborate.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office
in Karlsruhe, said police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers
on ``suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern European
intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,
he said.
   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''
and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.
   He said investigators are trying to assess how much damage was
caused to Western security interests.
   Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for the federal Interior Ministry,
said information was provided to Soviet intelligence agents.
   The officials declined to elaborate.
   In Hamburg today, West Germany's best-known club for computer
hackers said that in autumn 1987, it warned federal officials about
the vulnerability of international computer systems. However, Chaos
Computer Club president Wau Holland said federal officials ``did not
take the opportunity for a talk.''
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said that at the bidding of Soviet agents,
the computer hackers gained access to a U.S. Defense Department
computer and important research and business computers elsewhere.
   The hackers obtained sensitive information that would allow the
Soviets themselves to gain access to the computers and develop
technology based on the information, the network said.
   The information would also give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network said.
   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were
delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the door
for the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computer
centers of the Western world.''
   William Bardeen, head of the theory group at Fermilab in Batavia,
said Soviets participate in research there. ``So there are Soviet
scientists living at Fermilab and using the computers. There isn't
anything confidential or strategic in the computers.''
   Jeff Schwartz, spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory, said
he knew of no evidence that a foreign intelligence agency had gained
access to its classified computer system.
   Norddeutsche Runkfunk said the three suspects were detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover.
   ZDF television said the three suspects ``belonged to a hardcore
of 10 hackers.''
   According to Norddeutsche Rundfunk, authorities believe the three
West German hackers were recruited by the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence agency, in 1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs ...
and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the
Soviets.''
   The network said the trio handed over information from the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany
at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East Berlin.
   In Tokyo, a laboratory official said today that unknown West
German hackers broke into a computer system in a Japanese government
research laboratory in 1985.
   The National Laboratory For High Energy Physics discovered that a
research project was penetrated in mid-1985, laboratory spokesman
Shinichi Watanabe said. He said no sensitive information was stolen,
and the laboratory has since heightened security by changing
passwords and other measures.
   He said it was not known if the intruders were part of the
alleged spy ring in West Germany.

   Officials on Friday said a West German
computer spy ring that sold stolen data to the Soviets represents a
new and dangerous dimension in international espionage.
   ``The illegal entry into hundreds of data systems is an extremely
dangerous new threat,'' federal Interior Minister Friedrich
Zimmermann said.
   ``Governments and businesses must now become extremely
vigilant,'' Zimmermann said a day after officials said they had
penetrated a ring of ``hackers'' who sold thousands of passwords and
codes from military and research computers in the United States,
Western Europe and Japan to Soviet intelligence agents.
   Zimmermann, whose ministry is responsible for counterespionage
and domestic intelligence-gathering, called the hackers' operations
``a new dimension of Soviet bloc spy agencies.''
   Although he said it was too soon to assess the full extent of the
damage, he added the investigation had ``succeeded in dealing a
major blow against the KGB Soviet secret service.''
   Juergen Schmid, a spokesman for the federal Justice Ministry,
called the incident ``extremely serious, but not drastic.''
   ``The hackers were able to gain entry, but failed to penetrate
deep into the secret areas of the databanks,'' he said.
   Security officials Friday said three men were in custody and
another five were under investigation.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal Prosecutor's
Office, said the suspects range in age from 25 to 35.
   He said several were involved with illegal drugs, but did not
elaborate.
   Prechtel said police in Hanover arrested two hackers on
``suspicion of espionage activities for an Eastern European
intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,
he said.
   Officials of the federal Criminal Investigation Office in
Wiesbaden said more than 100 state officers and federal agents were
involved in making the arrests and in subsequent searches of
apartments in West Berlin, Hanover and Hamburg.
   A West German broadcast network, Norddeutsche Rundfunk, said
Thursday the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included
the U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known as Optimus; a
NASA and a Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' research
computer; and computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Fermi

findings were secret.

Geneva said attempts were made in 1986 and 1987 to gain access to
the lab's computers. A laboratory offical, who asked not to be
identified, said Soviet and other specialists have been visiting
researchers at the facility for years.
   In Brussels, European Economic Community officials said the West
German hackers had penetrated a European Space Agency computer in
Paris.
   Willy Helin, a spokesman for the EEC's Research and
Telecommunications Commission, said specialists are trying to
determine whether suspected Soviet agents had also gained access to
other EEC computer networks.
   In Tokyo, a lab official said unknown West German hackers broke
into a computer system in a Japanese government research lab in 1985.

<TEXT>
   An imaginative novelist writing a thriller about amateur spy-chasing might invent a Clifford Stoll, but it's unlikely. 
It's also unnecessary. 
Amateur spy-chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person, or as he might waggishly put it, a surreal person. 

   He is 37, an astronomer with impressive credentials, and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding. 
He once described himself as a "Berkeley Hippie," and played the role well; obligatory ragged jeans, a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional, including, for a time at least, formal marriage to his "sweetheart," Martha Matthews. 
He also is an entertaining writer, combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work. 
In "The Cuckoo's Egg" (Doubleday, 326 pages, $19.95), he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy. 

   The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB. 
One of them, 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S., searching for secrets. 
He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of the material Hess collected. 
They promised yet more for really good stuff. 

   Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds, making them surrogate parents. 
The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&amp;T. 
Using Gnu-Emacs, the spy could substitute a bogus "atrun" program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes. 
Once his cuckoo's egg was laid, he could enter Unix and become a "super-user," with access to everything. 

   Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab's computers. 
He discovered a 75-cent discrepancy in the charges made to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named "Hunter," who had no valid billing address. 
Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers. 

   But after much tracking, it became evident to Mr. Stoll, through various clues, that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California. 
Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll. 
He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab's computers. 
After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named Joe Sventek, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, to alert him when Sventek came on the line. 
Some nights he slept under his desk. 
His boss complained about neglect of other chores. 

   The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies. 
The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets. 
When the hacker moved, Mr. Stoll moved too, calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion. 
Sometimes, if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file, he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his quarry. 

   The FBI initially showed little interest, and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape. 
The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage. 
One learns a lot from this book, or seems to, about crippling federal bureaucracy. 
"Seems to" because it's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll. 

   Finally, he got help. 
Tymnet is a major network linking computers. 
One of its international specialists, Steve White, took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll's hunt, ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany. 
The West Germans then took over and finally found Markus Hess. 

   Eventually, Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and NSA to brief high-ranking officers on computer theft. 
He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up chaps. 
Back in Berkeley, he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady friend for consorting with such people. 
He became angry in return. 
He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal "spooks" who make national security their business. 
At several different levels, it's a fascinating tale.

   The U.S. government has tentatively concluded
that a spy ring of West German computer hackers did not gain access
to the types of secrets that would jeopardize America's national
security, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said he was
not at liberty to discuss the specific computer networks the German
hackers penetrated, what they learned in the process and what they
passed on to the Warsaw Pact.
   But, in breaking two weeks of official silence, Howard said the
Defense Department no longer viewed the case as a serious threat to
military security.
   ``Based on the information that we have thus far, and this is not
complete ... our best judgment is that the computer hackers did not
penetrate secure programs,'' Howard said.
   The initial review of evidence assembled by American and West
German authorities suggests the spy ring never gained access to the
computer systems that contain classified secrets, he continued.
   ``All this is subject to change should new information turn up in
the course of the investigation. But, to the best of our knowledge,
it does not appear at this point that there was any compromise of
classified information,'' Howard said.
   The West German government broke up the computer espionage
operation March 3, arresting three individuals and later disclosing
that eight others were still under investigation.
   On March 6, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor in West
Germany, Alexander Prechtel, told reporters the continuing
investigation suggested ``the information obtained by the hackers
does not appear to be that sensitive.''
   The U.S. government, however, had declined until Thursday to say
whether it agreed with that assessment.
   The West German ring was cracked in large measure through the
work of a lone U.S. computer expert, an astronomer named Clifford
Stoll. Stoll has said he observed the ring trying to break into
about 450 computer banks, and that the hackers did gain access to
the Pentagon's general data bank, named Optimus, as well as
computers at several defense contractors and U.S. military bases.
   West Germany's ARD television network has reported the hackers
also tapped NASA and ``Star Wars'' research computers. Citing
unidentified sources, the network reported that three hackers handed
over information from the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
Italy, Switzerland and West Germany during a 1985 meeting with two
KGB agents in East Berlin.
   The TV network also reported that authorities believe the West
German hackers were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in
1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs.''
   Howard, while breaking the U.S. government's silence on the
matter, declined to confirm precisely which computer databanks the
hackers penetrated.
   ``No classified programs. That's really about all I can say on
the subject,'' he replied.
   ``I don't have any information that would imply there was any
involvement by Americans,'' Howard added.

<TEXT>  By Katie Hafner and John Markoff; Simon &amp; Schuster, 327 pp., $22.95;  THE
popular image of the computer hacker has taken a troubling turn over the past
decade -- from harmless hobbyist to computer criminal.;    The hackers of the
1960s and 1970s were computer enthusiasts who built the software and hardware
that would launch an industry. Though given to pranks, they believed strongly
in open access to computer systems and adhered to a hacker ethic that frowned
upon damaging data.;    In the 1980s, the term came to define a new generation
of electronic interlopers -- ones who penetrated computers for power or
financial gain. Though they shared their predecessors' obsession with
computers, these pranksters were often malicious, and they had no social
mission, no code of conduct. Some call them "crackers," not hackers.;    In
"Cyberpunk," Katie Hafner and John Markoff, who are wife and husband, examine
this darker generation of computer hacker by focusing on the three most
notorious high-tech outlaws of the 1980s. Hafner, a former high-tech reporter
for Business Week, and Markoff, who covers the computer industry for the New
York Times, have burrowed deeply into the computer underground and emerged
with a captivating account.;    The first study in computer crime is the story
of Kevin Mitnick, the shy, overweight Southern California teen who has come to
typify this new generation.;    A loner who came from a broken family, Mitnick
started as a "phone phreak," using stolen access codes for free long-distance
calling. Intoxicated by the power and attention it gave him, Mitnick moved on
to far more sophisticated high jinks on the phone and computer networks.;   
Along with his companions, Mitnick penetrated an extraordinary number of
computers, many of them in the Bay Area. They destroyed data on computers at
U.S. Leasing in San Francisco; invaded the systems of Santa Cruz Operation, a
software developer; and stole proprietary software from Digital Equipment
Corp.'s computers in Palo Alto. Mitnick, the authors note, was a master of
"social engineering," the art of persuading secretaries and bureaucratic
functionaries to relinquish computer access codes by posing as their
superiors.;    In many ways the most fascinating account of "Cyberpunk" is the
story of Pengo, a young West Berlin computer hacker named for a video arcade
game, and his loose-knit West German hacking ring. Of all the characters in
this book, they come closest to the authors' idea of "cyberpunks," a
description borrowed from science fiction writer William Gibson.;    Drawn
together by an obsession with computers, a love of science fiction and a taste
for hashish, Pengo and his companions hatched a scheme to sell their hacking
skills to the Soviets. They seem to have been motivated more by the allure of
riches than a desire to equalize the balance of powers. The hackers, the
authors reveal, often duped their technically unsophisticated KGB contact,
earning top dollar for what in many cases was free, public-domain software.;  
 This account, of course, is the other side of the electronic sleuthing story
told by Clifford Stoll in "The Cuckoo's Egg." Stoll tracked one of the West
German hackers after he penetrated the computers at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratories. Stoll, a Berkeley liberal now lionized by many in the computer
security field, was "a bit of a crank" for calling in the FBI and the CIA to
investigate the hackers, the authors say.;    Old-school hacker;  "Cyberpunk"
concludes with the story of Robert T. Morris Jr., the gifted Cornell grad
student who unleashed a computer "worm" that paralyzed computers across the
country. The inclusion of Morris complicates the book, for although Morris'
worm will be remembered as one of the most notorious computer "crimes" of the
decade, it rapidly becomes apparent that Morris doesn't belong in the company
of a Mitnick or a Pengo.;    Morris is a hacker much more of the old school.
The son of an eccentric, brilliant mathematician, Morris grew up joyriding
around his father's computers at Bell Labs, something like learning to drive
on a Lamborghini. Shy and insecure, Morris was a first-rate programmer by the
time he began his freshman year at Harvard University.;    With a reputation
for witty, harmless pranks, Morris wrote a program that was intended partly as
a show of his programming prowess and partly to prove a point about security
holes in Berkeley Unix, a widely used software environment. His program was
designed to quietly insert a single copy of itself onto computers on the
Internet, a national computer network.;    But because of a programming error,
the "worm" replicated faster than Morris had intended, clogging 6,000
computers on the Internet within hours after he had unleashed it. Although the
damage was extensive, it was the result of an innocent error.;    Pioneering
reporting;  "Cyberpunk" is well-written and thoroughly reported, drawing on
interviews with the hackers themselves, their families and law enforcement
officials. One gets the sense that Hafner and Markoff are breaking new ground,
particularly in the West German hacking case. (For example, it has been
suggested that the bizarre self-immolation of one of the hackers was not a
suicide but a KGB assassination. The authors provide evidence that the death
indeed was probably the act of a deeply troubled young man.);    Yet the book
only skims the surface of the broader questions raised by the cases it has
examined. What accounts for this dark turn in the image of the computer
hacker? What implications do these characters and their crimes have for a
society that relies more and more on computers? How have these cases helped
define the concepts of privacy and freedom in the electronic world? Whatever
impact these outlaws on the computer frontier will have is speculation, but it
is speculation that the authors are richly qualified to make. It's a
disappointment that they didn't try.  </TEXT>

   A Harvard astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an
international electronic spy ring in West Germany by tracking down
the ``hacker'' who broke into his computer files.
   For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonely
obsession for 38-year-old Clifford Stoll, who initially was unable
to convince the FBI to investigate the computer break-in.
   On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of
three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer
passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon has
not determined the extent of the damage to U.S. security.
   A West German television network said the passwords and other
information came from key military and research computers in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
   ``I would say (Stoll) was largely responsible for cracking the
case,'' said Charles S. Hurley, former spokesman for the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., where Stoll once worked.
``Over a period of many months, he tracked them.''
   It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that Stoll noticed
in the California laboratory's shared-time computer system accounts
in August 1986.
   ``If it had been $1,000 off, I wouldn't have thought anything of
it,'' Stoll said in an interview Thursday. ``It's like, if your
house collapses, you just assume there's been an earthquake. But if
you find a tiny termite hole, you think, `Geez, I'd better
investigate.' It's the little problems that are the most
fascinating.''
   Stoll, a computer expert with a doctorate in astronomy from the
University of Arizona, searched for clues for three days and
discovered the error was caused by someone who had gained access to
the computer through telephone lines.
   ``For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what he
typed in,'' said the bushy-haired Stoll.
   Stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use
the Berkeley Laboratory's computer as a gateway to the so-called
Milnet, a computer network linking defense plants, university labs
and military installations.
   ``He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI,
biological warfare, Norad. He was reading everything he could get
his hands on, and then it turns out he was selling it to the
Soviets,'' Stoll said.
   He said he told the FBI about the hacker in the late summer of
1986, but there wasn't much of a response.
   ``They said, `What have you lost?' I said, `Well, all we've
actually lost is 75 cents.' So the FBI said, `Who cares, it's not
important.'''
   To be fair, Stoll added, ``They're much more sensitive to
computer break-ins now.''
   Charles Steinmetz, a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, said
the bureau would not comment on the case.
   Stoll said his girlfriend, tired of his electronic pager that
would beep whenever the hacker got onto the system, was responsible
for the big break in the case. She suggested that he lay a trap.
   He created bogus military data and a fictitious computer network
called ``SDI Net.'' The hacker took the bait, spending two hours
reading through the material, giving Stoll enough time to trace the
call to Hanover, West Germany.
   Three months later, Stoll said, he got a letter from a man in
Pittsburgh asking for information about SDI Net. When he turned that
letter over to the FBI in April 1987, he said, the bureau found the
man had connections to Eastern European governments and immediately
began an investigation.
   In all, Stoll said the spy ring had attempted to break into about
450 different computers and succeeded in stealing information from
more than 40 of them _ including data systems at the Pentagon,
defense contracting firms and U.S. military bases around the world.
   According to a German television network, authorities believe the
West German hackers were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and
``were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to provide
the codes and passwords to the Soviets.''
   Stoll now has a contract from Doubleday Inc. to write a book
about his not-so-amateur sleuthing.
   But he said he is glad the case is nearing an end so he can get
back to work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
Cambridge, Mass.
   ``In one sense, it was exciting,'' he said. ``In another sense,
it was dreadful, because I got zero astronomy done for two years.''

<HEAD>PBS' Top Science Show Opens Season with ... a Comedy-Drama?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most delightful program on television
Tuesday night is a mystery-comedy-espionage thriller about a
mild-mannered astronomer who tracks down a KGB-financed spy ring.
   It's the true story of Clifford Stoll, a tale of suspense, high
technology, international intrigue, wonderful sight gags - even a
shower scene! - and it's the season premiere of ``Nova,'' PBS' fine
science documentary series.
   ``The KGB, the Computer and Me,'' is Stoll's account, re-enacted
by him and the other people involved, of his two-year hunt for a
computer hacker who had systematically penetrated the U.S. network
of military and academic computers.
   In August 1986, Stoll was a stock comic figure of academe: a
scientist whose grant had expired. With his wiry shock of dark hair
and laid-back wardrobe, he looks more like a Grateful Dead fan
(which he is) than an astronomer.
   Fortunately for him and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the
University of California at Berkeley, the lab needed a manager for
its computer system, and he was hired.
   On his first day in his new job, the boss asks him to track down
a 75-cent discrepancy in the computer billing report.
   ``Thousands of dollars of charges, off by 75 cents, didn't sound
like much,'' Stoll noted, ``but it was an interesting problem. A
big error would mean an obvious bug in the system, easy to find and
fix.
   ``But 75 cents? That was a challenge!''
   And thereby hangs a fascinating story about science, scientists
and the business of doing science.
   The 75-cent error eventually led Stoll to the electronic
fingerprints of a hacker who'd used a personal computer and
telephone connection to break into the Berkeley computer system
from far away.
   ``He was really like a burglar who knows a few ways to
burglarize a house and uses them over and over again,'' Stoll
recounted in a telephone interview. ``He tries the front door, the
back door, and pushes on a couple of windows, and when he can't get
in, he moves on.
   ``He figures, `Sooner or later I'll find one where somebody left
the key in the door.' ''
   Tight computer security - like burglar bars on windows - make
the ``environment'' more difficult for its legitimate occupants as
well as potential invaders. The hacker was exploiting the system's
openness.
   Once inside the computer, the hacker used standard programming
techniques to exploit a ``bug'' in the computer's operating system
and take it over.
   Invisibly, the hacker had made himself a ``super-user'' able to
read, write, erase and remove any file in the program.
   Stoll was angry and appalled. Part of the lab's computer system
is used in high-energy radiation therapy for certain brain tumors.
The hacker was fooling with computer programs that aim heavy
radiation into living people's brains.
   ``When you screw around with systems that you don't know about,
you can't predict what the effects will be,'' Stoll said. ``He
thought he knew and he didn't.''
   It would have been a simple matter to lock out the hacker, fix
the bug in the system and wrap things up, but Stoll wanted to catch
him or her or it.
   And, to his growing concern, the hacker was using the Lawrence
Berkeley computer to move around on the network of university and
non-classified Defense Department computers around the country.
   The hacker was intruding into military databases, defense
contractors, even the Pentagon. True, none of the material was
classified, but it also wasn't the kind of information you read in
the newspapers, either.
   Stoll went to the FBI. A 75-cent error? They weren't interested.
Stoll's quest ultimately led him to ``various three-letter
agencies'' that included the CIA and the ultra-secret NSA.
   ``It was frustrating to find people who really are bureaucrats,
who very much want to help but can't because of the structure of
where they work,'' Stoll said.
   ``The rumors that you hear are true: The government would like
to help you, but it can't. It just doesn't know how,'' he said.
   Stoll persisted, and his efforts eventually led to the arrest,
trial and conviction of a group of West German hackers with links
to the KGB. Stoll even testified at their trial.
   The story he re-enacts, and his equally fascinating book about
the case, ``The Cuckoo's Egg,'' are about science, Stoll insists.
   ``A lot of the time we think the idea of science is to come up
with answers,'' he said. ``That is so bogus!
   ``If you're doing good science, you don't care what the answer
is. You want to find the process, the method. You passionately want
to find the procedure. It seems to me the work I did in catching
this hacker would have been just as satisfying if it had turned out
to be some teen-ager down the block.''

   Investigators have cracked a major spy
ring in which West German ``hackers'' allegedly acquired sensitive
military computer passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets,
an official said Thursday.
   A West German television network said the passwords and other
information came from key military and research computers in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
   Three West Germans have been detained on suspicion of ``obtaining
information about access to databanks, and to have passed that on to
Soviet intelligence agents,'' said Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for
the federal Interior Ministry.
   He refused to confirm other details of a report by the
Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network.
   The Pentagon issued a one-sentence statement Thursday saying:
``Until possibly affected components of the Department of Defense
have had a chance to analyze the report, we have no reaction.''
   William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department would
have no further comment before Friday at the earliest.
   One security source in West Germany, speaking in an interview
with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the
``hackers'' tried to break into a large U.S. military computer
network in West Germany but failed to gain access to secret material.
   Police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers on ``suspicion of
espionage activities for an Eastern European intelligence agency,''
said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office in Karlsruhe. Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin, he
said.
   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''
and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.
   He said investigators still are trying to determine how much
damage the suspected espionage had caused to Western security
interests.
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk reported the hackers gained access to a key
U.S. Defense Department computer and to important research computers
elsewhere.
   They obtained sensitive information that would allow the Soviets
to gain access to the computers, the network said.
   Among the computers was the U.S. Defense Department's general
databank known as Optimus, a NASA computer, as well as computers
tied to nuclear weapons and energy research in New Mexico and
Illinois, the network said.
   Those facilities are the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, N.M., and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near
Chicago.
   The information also would give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network statement said.
   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were
delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the door
for the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computer
centers of the Western world.''
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said three suspects had been detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover. The network also said investigators had seized ``extensive
evidence'' in the searches.
   According to the network, authorities believe three West Germans
were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and ``were paid with cash
and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and
passwords to the Soviets.''
   The network also said the three handed over ``highly sensitive
information from the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France,
Italy, Switzerland and West Germany'' at a 1985 meeting with two KGB
agents in East Berlin.
   Bachmeier said the arrests followed an investigation by the
federal Constitution Protection Office _ the country's main
counterespionage bureau _ as well as criminal investigators and the
Federal Prosecutor's Office.

Authorities have arrested three West German computer "hackers" on suspicion 
that they carried out international electronic espionage and sold sensitive 
data to the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB, judicial officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The ARD television network -- which made public the breakup of the spy ring 
after one of its affiliates carried out a 10-month investigation -- said the 
hackers helped the KGB gain access to computer data banks of the Pentagon, the 
nuclear arms laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M., and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB also received computer passwords and other materials from nuclear, 
space and commercial electronic data banks in West Germany, France, 
Switzerland, Britain and Japan, ARD said. 
</P>
<P>
"If current suspicions are confirmed, what we very surely have is a new quality 
of espionage against our data systems," Gerhard Boeden, Bonn's chief of 
domestic counterespionage, said in an interview with ARD. 
</P>
<P>
Existing Western computer systems are "not sufficiently" secured, said Boeden, 
who is president of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office. The agency is 
roughly equivalent to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Interior Ministry and the federal prosecutor's office did not 
deny the detailed ARD report. But they provided only sketchy information on 
grounds that an investigation is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokeswoman in Bonn on Thursday evening declined to comment on a 
report by the West German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur quoting 
unidentified government security sources as saying the case is "extremely 
grave." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Pentagon issued a one-sentence statement saying: "Until 
possibly affected components of the Department of Defense have had a chance to 
analyze the report, we have no reaction." 
</P>
<P>
The hackers apparently provided the Soviets with opportunities to obtain North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization military secrets and information about sensitive 
high technology, the German news agency quoted the sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
ARD described the affair as the most serious case of Soviet Bloc espionage to 
be discovered in West Germany since 1974, when Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned 
after a close personal aide was found to be an East German spy. 
</P>
<P>
Two men have been arrested in Hanover and a third in West Berlin, judicial 
officials said. Authorities have searched at least six residences in West 
Berlin, Hanover and Hamburg and confiscated a substantial quantity of evidence, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
ARD reported that two KGB agents obtained top-secret computer data from the 
three hackers in exchange for money and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB is believed to have used computer passwords and other information 
obtained from the hackers to penetrate the U.S. Defense Department staff data 
bank OPTIMIS and U.S. military supply depot computers, ARD said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Penetrations 
</P>
<P>
It also was suspected that the Soviets penetrated computers of the West 
European nuclear research center CERN in Geneva; the European Space Agency; the 
Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, West Germany; the 
French arms and electronics company Thomson, and other West European and 
Japanese electronics companies, ARD said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the hackers are believed to have helped the Soviets obtain access to 
Western technology for manufacturing silicon chips, which are the central 
components of modern computers. 
</P>
<P>
The group of hackers first met in Hanover in 1985, ARD said. Later they began 
cooperating with two KGB agents, at first freely and later under pressure and 
threats from the Soviets, it said.

Finding a 75-cent accounting error in his computer system became an obsession 
for a Harvard astronomer. When he finally got to the bottom of it, he had found 
not only his missing quarters, but also an Eastern European electronic spy 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
For more than six months, finding the computer "hacker" who broke into his 
files consumed 38-year-old Clifford Stoll. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of three hackers who 
allegedly acquired sensitive military computer passwords and codes and sold 
them to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that Stoll noticed in the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's shared-time computer system accounts in August, 
1986, when he was with the California facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been $1,000 off, I wouldn't have thought anything of it," Stoll 
said. "It's like, if your house collapses, you just assume there's been an 
earthquake. But if you find a tiny termite hole, you think, 'Geez, I'd better 
investigate.' It's the little problems that are the most fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing but Watch' 
</P>
<P>
Stoll searched for clues for three days and discovered that the error was 
caused by someone who had gained access to the computer through telephone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what he typed in," said 
the bushy-haired Stoll. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use the Berkeley 
Laboratory's computer as a gateway to the so-called Milnet, a computer network 
linking defense plants, university labs and military installations. 
</P>
<P>
"He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI (Strategic Defense 
Initiative), biological warfare, NORAD (North American Air Defense). He was 
reading everything he could get his hands on, and then it turns out he was 
selling it to the Soviets," Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he told the FBI about the hacker in the late summer of 1986 but 
that there wasn't much of a response.

Bogus Military Data

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three computer hackers suspected
of giving the Soviet Union information from military and industrial
computers worldwide were indicted on espionage charges, prosecutors
said Wednesday.
   The West German government called the breakup of the spy ring,
which gave the KGB secret data from 12 countries including the
United States, ``a major blow'' to the Soviets.
   In a four-page statement, chief federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann
said it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers for
endangering national security.
   The men, identified only by their first names and last initial,
were indicted ``on suspicion of espionage activities for the Soviet
intelligence agency KGB,'' Rebmann said. The defendents were Peter
C. and Markus H. of Hanover, and Dirk B. of West Berlin, he said.
   The men were arrested in March. Peter C. and Dirk B. are in
prison, while Markus H. has been released pending trial, Rebmann
said. There was no indication when the trial would begin.
   The full range of information the Soviets received is not known,
but the espionage activities, first detected by a U.S. computer
specialist, had been in operation since at least September, 1986,
Rebmann said.
   The Soviets paid about $49,000 for the information, he said.
   The hackers gave the Soviets programs and passwords for computer
systems in industrial and military areas. They also gave Moscow a
``Security pack'' designed to prevent unauthorized computer
break-ins, Rebmann said.
   The three men broke into computers in West Germany, the United
States, France, Britain, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Austria, Spain,
the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, and the British colony of Hong Kong,
he said.
   Among the systems to which the hackers gained access was a key
U.S. Defense Department computer known as Optimus, according to West
Germany's ARD television.
   Other computers affected included some used by NASA and defense
researchers, as well as computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy
research in the United States, ARD said.
   The defendant Peter C. delivered his Soviet contact agent
``Serge'' information in about 25 separate meetings over the course
of 2{ years in Communist East Berlin, Rebmann said.

<LEADPARA>  For more than a year, officials at Digital Equipment Corp.'s secretive Western
Research Lab in Palo Alto watched as hackers invaded the lab's computers,
stole important software and read confidential messages. Short of breaking
Digital's primary electronic link with the outside world, officials found that
they could do little to thwart the hackers.;   Digital's top security official
believed they were dealing with a sophisticated West German spy ring that was
passing software to the Soviets. But in December 1988, following a call from
one of the hackers, Digital learned the interlopers were two high school
dropouts working at night from an office in Southern California, fueled by an

<HEADLINE>  BOOK FOLLOWS TRAIL OF HACKERS' HIGH-TECH CAPERS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Already legendary in computer security circles, the exploits of Kevin D.
Mitnick and Leonard DiCicco are one focus of a new book on computer crime,
"Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier" (Simon &amp; Schuster,
$22.95). The book details, for the first time, the extent to which the hackers
breached computer security at a number of Bay Area companies in the late
1980s.;   The book, by Katie Hafner, a former Business Week high-tech
reporter, and John Markoff, her husband and a reporter for the New York Times
who covers the computer industry, has hovered on a Bay Area best-seller list
since its release several weeks ago.;   In addition to Mitnick and DiCicco,
the authors chronicle the escapades of a West German hacking ring and of
Robert T. Morris Jr., who wrote the "worm" program that in 1988 brought down
the Internet, a network of 6,000 computers. Together, the three cases offer a
striking illustration of the possibilities -- and dangers -- of national and
international computer networks.;   Over several years, Mitnick and hacking
associates destroyed data at US Leasing, an equipment leasing company in San
Francisco; penetrated the development computers at the Santa Cruz Operation, a
software developer; and regularly broke into Digital computers in Palo Alto
and elsewhere. Mitnick, the authors said, was motivated by "the challenge of
the hack itself" and an "intellectual curiosity" of complex computer systems.;
  Among the book's disclosures: Mitnick stole a complete copy of VMS' source
code, the operating software that controls Digital's VAX mainframe computers,
and a copy of a security program called XSAFE. The source code can cost
Digital customers as much as $360,000, depending on the size of their
computer.;   Digital, the nation's second-largest computer maker, filed a
lawsuit against Mitnick but eventually settled out of court because of fears
that publicity over the incident could damage the Maynard, Mass., company,
Hafner said in an interview. "DEC was quite happy to see it not go to trial,"
she said.;   Mitnick was convicted on criminal charges and served a year in
jail and six months in treatment for what authorities said was an addiction to
computers. He still is doing computer-related work in Las Vegas, according to
a law enforcement official.;   In an interview, Digital officials acknowledged
the break-ins and stolen software. But they said the episode taught the
company how to make its computers more secure and spawned new software
products designed to increase security.;   "We put a lot of effort into a
security standard on the Easynet (Digital's internal network)," said Steve
Lipner, manager of the secure systems group. "The susceptibility to that kind
of problem has dropped way off.";   In an earlier episode, Mitnick and DiCicco
penetrated computers at the Santa Cruz Operation. But unlike Digital, the
authors said, the software company acted quickly, tracking the hackers to
Mitnick's Thousand Oaks apartment before they could do any damage or steal
software. Santa Cruz police traveled to Southern California and searched the
apartment. Mitnick pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received a small fine
and 36 months' probation.;   Among the book's other revelations:;   (check)
Mitnick penetrated Digital's systems engineering group in Palo Alto at a time
when engineers were working secretly to introduce a new computer work station
ahead of its competitors. Although the intruders seemed uninterested in the
group's ongoing projects, Digital kept specifications of the new machine out
of the computer as a special precaution, the authors said.;   (check) Digital
unwittingly gave Mitnick a key tool for capturing passwords that enabled him
access to the company's computers. The tool, a software program called the
"loginout patch," was sitting in Digital's network after the company
discovered that a West German hacking ring had used it to penetrate VAX
computers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.;   (check)
Using the gateway to Digital's network at the Western Research Lab, Mitnick
was able to penetrate the company's brain center, its software development
center in Nashua, N.H., and make off with the latest versions of the company's
operating software.  </TEXT>

   West German authorities Monday
warned businesses and public institutions that Soviet intelligence
has obtained passwords and codes to gain access into their computers.
   A statement by the Federal Criminal Office said the codes
apparently were passed to the Soviet KGB by three West German
``hackers'' arrested this month.
   The three are suspected of selling thousands of codes and
passwords from Western military and research computers to Soviet
intelligence agents.
   Police authorities investigating the case have determined that
the hackers allegedly planned to break into or succeeded in breaking
into many other computers, the statement said.
   ``The KGB is capable of gaining full access to computer data of
businesses and public institutions,'' it added.
   It said obtaining computer codes and passwords has become a ``new
type of espionage by the East.''
   When the three were arrested, authorities said they had cracked a
major spy ring and warned of a new dimension in Soviet-bloc
espionage.

   Officials investigating computer
spies who passed information from Western computers to the Soviets
believe the hackers did not make a major security breach, a
spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor said today.
   Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann called last week's breakup
of the spy ring a ``major blow'' to the Soviet KGB. He said Friday
the hackers were ``an extremely dangerous new threat'' to security
but that further inquiry would be needed to determine the extent of
the damage.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for chief federal prosecutor Kurt
Rebmann, said today: ``The information obtained by the hackers does
not appear to be that sensitive.''
   Prechtel made the comment when asked about news reports saying
the hackers had mainly obtained access codewords for the computers.
   He said eight West Germans are still under investigation. Three
men were arrested last week.
   West Germany's ARD television network said the hackers tapped
into information from the U.S. Defense Department and computers
handling sensitive research on nuclear weapons.
   It said the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included
the Defense Department's general databank, and a NASA and ``Star
Wars'' research computer.
   The television report said three hackers handed over information
from the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland
and West Germany at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East
Berlin.
   The report said authorities believe West German hackers were
recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in 1985 and ``were paid
with cash and drugs.''

<TEXT>
   A hacker's success in penetrating a
non-classified Pentagon computer network and searching NASA and
Navy data banks shows security measures are failing to keep pace
with sophisticated computer systems, scientists say.
   ``It's a subject that makes (computer) people turn pale and
sweat,'' said Hal Masursky, a member of a National Academy of
Sciences subcommittee on computer security.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Thursday that one or more
hackers, or computer buffs, successfully penetrated a Defense
Department computer network the night of May 16, then examined
files at the lab, the Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland and at
least one other facility into the early hours of May 17.
   No damage was done, no data was stolen and the incident is under
investigation by the FBI and security officers from National
Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in Washington,
said Haskell G. O'Brien, JPL's manager of communications and
computing network services.
   The break-in shows that ``fewer people are monitoring (computer
access) than should be. More people need to keep their eyes open,''
said Cliff Stoll, a computer scientist at California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory. ``It's unfortunately easy for people to
randomly break in.''
   The network that was breached, named ARPANET, is a
non-classified network for sharing scientific information, and is
operated by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, O'Brien said.
   Thousands of computers are connected to the network at hundreds
of U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, including
some military research facilities and other NASA offices, he added.
   ``Networking has spread like wildfire, but the security
precautions are a new art,'' said Masursky, a Flagstaff,
Ariz.-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist who worked on several
NASA space missions. ``With a hacker who is very clever, trying to
guarantee he can't access things (computers) is very difficult.''
   O'Brien said authorities don't know if the hacker operated from
the United States or abroad, although NASA suspects involvement by
the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, which has been
linked to past computer security breaches.
   ``The signature looked a little like things they do, but also
looked a little different,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, West
Germany, that he was unaware of the break-in.
   O'Brien called the incident serious because programs used to
design microcircuits could have been damaged.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said from Washington that
``there is no indication that any classified information has been
obtained by such hacker activity.''
   The break-in was the third known violation of computer security
at JPL in two years, O'Brien said, citing a previously publicized
August 1986 break-in by a West German hacker, and another last
summer, in which the perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.
   The hacker in last month's incident first gained access to the
Pentagon network through another computer at an undisclosed
location, O'Brien said. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password
_ the name of a JPL employee _ to gain access to the lab's computer.
   The hacker then used JPL's Digital Equipment Corp. computer as a
conduit to enter another ARPANET computer at Patuxent, where
authorities noticed something was amiss and notified JPL, O'Brien
said, adding he didn't know how many other computers also were
penetrated.
   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigating
the details of this,'' he said.
   JPL spokesman George Alexander said that as soon as the break-in
was discovered, ``we pulled JPL out of the network.''
   ``Our procedures are being tightened considerably to make sure
this won't happen again,'' Alexander said.
   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old
West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.
military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were
detected in August 1986 by Lawrence Berkeley officials.
   Targets included computers at JPL, the Berkeley lab and Air
Force Systems Command in El Segundo, Calif.

THE HACKER CRACKDOWN by Bruce Sterling Viking Pounds 16.99, 328 pages
ONE CAN appreciate the fun. You are hunched over the computer in your
bedroom, while Mom and Dad are relaxing downstairs in front of the other
kind of screen. You are hooked up to the telephone for hours, but it is not
costing a cent because the first call you make is to the phone company's
billing computer to tell it to forget the charges. Routine stuff; but then,
after hours of trying different numbers and different passwords - you hit it
big.
Pages and pages of telephone numbers and switching codes scroll down your
screen. This is no junk. The computer sending it is in the telephone command
centre. It thinks you are a supervisor and waits, like Aladdin's slave, to
do your order. So what? Well, how about this for a crazy thing? You re-route
everyone who dials the Palm Beach County Probation Department (in Delray
Beach, Florida) to Tina in New York State. She sells them pornographic
phone-sex.
Then you call up a bulletin board (a dial-up computer used as a message
centre by fellow crazies) to tell them, and particularly the Legion of Doom,
what a smart-ass you are. You sign on as Fry Guy, like usual. The other
phone phreaks, they laugh good. They say (but you disbelieve them) that they
have pulled many smarter raps. Then you go buy pizza.
Unfortunately, some people who read your message are not so completely
amused. They write it all down in spiral notebooks and then ask some even
less humorous guys: what kind of a perv would connect citizens who need the
Miami probation service to an East Coast phono-tart? And they say, maybe his
next little joke will be to call up some goddam computer and tell it to fire
a cruise missile at Wall Street . . .
So, a few months later, you are engaged in amusing converse with the Legion
in your bedroom when all the house doors are burst open by men with guns.
'You Fry Guy?', they say. 'Place your hands on your head and move real slow
away from that machine.' Mom and Dad say this is unbelievable.
But it happened. Fry Guy, a 16-year-old schoolboy who also admitted
infiltrating the MacDonald's payroll computer to give two of his friends a
raise, was convicted on May 31 1990, and put on probation.
The case thoroughly alarmed the US federal authorities. It showed that a
teenager with the simplest computer and a phone line could penetrate the
innermost fastnesses of the telecommunications network and re-program the
computers that control it. What mischief could he then do] Calls diverted or
monitored, accounts changed at will, telephone numbers deleted, altered or
created out of thin air; all this and more was within the grasp of the
hackers - and that 'more' was the ability to wipe out the whole telephone
system, including emergency services, for hours - possibly days.
Bruce Sterling has done a good job in describing the authorities' crackdown
since then on a group of hackers with sinister names, such as Legion of
Doom, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist, whose fun, it seemed, was becoming far
beyond a joke.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the US authorities had been more tolerant
of computer pranksters. One reason was that they refused to believe that the
network of thousands of academic, defence and company computers linked by
global telecommunications could be penetrated seriously by outsiders.
Intrusions were difficult to detect, and any that were discovered seemed to
do relatively little damage. Even when hackers were using telephone lines
without paying, the 'theft' of time from the network seemed rather abstract.
However, by the mid-1980s, as home computers became more sophisticated, some
spectacular break-ins were occuring. By far the best account is in Clifford
Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg, which explains how a German hacker hijacked the
international telecommunications system and broke into high security
computers all over the US, including one at the Pentagon.
Sterling tells the story of a concerted counter-move by the authorities. In
Operation Sundevil, during three days in May 1990, 40 computers were seized
with some 23,000 floppy disks containing, stolen passwords and credit card
numbers, programmes and logs of information exchanged by hackers over the
network.
Sterling, unlike Stoll, shows some sympathy for the more 'responsible'
hackers (ie those doing it as an intellectual game rather than with criminal
intent), but he acknowledges that the line is difficult, if not impossible,
to draw. He also explores libertarian issues, such as the damage caused by
the security services to innocent computer users.
This is an interesting but uneven book, in which fascinating facts are
sometimes padded out with generalisations and a bit too much discussion of
issues. A newcomer to the field should start with Stoll's superb 'whodunnit'
of cyberspace. Sterling is better than adequate in explaining what happened
next.

West German computer "hackers" repeatedly tricked the Soviet KGB into paying up 
to $164,000 for easily accessible and insignificant Western data bank 
information, a newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The hacker spies apparently exploited the ignorance of the Russians," the Welt 
am Sonntag newspaper said. "The hackers laughed their heads off" after being 
paid by the KGB, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was quoting from notes by federal officials investigating the 
affair, in which eight hackers are suspected of infiltrating Western military, 
industrial and research computer systems on behalf of the KGB starting in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The home-computer hackers are suspected of electronically tapping into, among 
other systems, a U.S. Defense Department data bank, the Italian-French arms 
maker Thomson SA and the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sensational' Data 
</P>
<P>
The KGB believed the hackers' success in penetrating the periphery of the 
Pentagon data bank was "sensational." They apparently did not know this was a 
relatively simple task for an amateur computer buff, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Welt am Sonntag said the KGB repeatedly paid the hackers large sums of money 
for "largely open information" because the "Pentagon was a magic word" for 
Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the federal prosecutor's office and the Interior Ministry 
declined comment on the article. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the investigation to date showed that the hackers were 
generally unable to breach computer core systems where sensitive military or 
industrial secrets are stored. 
</P>
<P>
West German government officials have termed the espionage case serious but 
warned against jumping to conclusions on its impact on Western security until 
inquiries are completed. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Defense Department says it has not yet determined what 
effect the spying has had on U.S. security.

<HEAD>Suspected KGB Computer Hacker Apparently Commits Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLFSBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German computer hacker
suspected of providing the Soviet KGB with code words to gain
access to Western research and defense computers apparently has
committed suicide, police said today.
   The body of a man found burned to death Thursday near the city
of Gifhorn, about 25 miles east of Hanover, has been identified as
that of Karl Koch, police said. Koch, 24, was under investigation
for his part in a computer scandal that resulted in international
headlines in March.
   Wolfsburg police said in a statement that Koch apparently doused
himself with gasoline and set himself on fire.
   A melted plastic gasoline canister was found near the body,
``and there were no signs of foul play from an outside source,''
the statement said.
   Koch was one of eight West German computer hackers under
investigation for allegedly supplying Soviet agents with code words
to gain access to Western computers. Those computers included the
U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known as Optimus, and a
NASA ``Star Wars'' research computer.
   Authorities said at the time that the hackers were believed to
have been recruited by the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency, in
1985 and ``were paid in cash and drugs'' to provide the code words.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, confirmed today that Koch was one of the
hackers under investigation.
   ``We are still investigating the others and expect to file
charges when the probe is completed,'' Foerster said.
   Officials have said that while the code words allegedly provided
by the hackers gave the Soviets access to various computer
networks, they were not sufficient to gain access to classified
information.

   A hacker linked his home computer to
about 50 U.S. military computers to gain access to sensitive
defense and aerospace information, a prosecutor said Monday.
   The 24-year-old university student tapped into the worldwide
computers for nearly two years through telephone links, according
to the West German newsmagazine Quick.
   West German authorities dropped their case, however, for lack of
evidence. FBI spokesmen said they were investigating but declined
to say if charges would be brought.
   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven who
originated these calls,'' said Hans-Georg von Bock, a prosecuting
attorney in Bremen.
   He said the hacker scoured California computers at the Air Force
Systems Command in El Segundo, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasedena, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley.
   Bock refused to say what the hacker, who lives in the northern
city of Hanover, discovered. Quick said he was able to find out the
names of U.S. Army officers in Japan and details about U.S. coastal
security systems.
   Authorities did not say if any important secrets were robbed.
   Bock said he remained convinced of the Hanover man's guilt. ``We
wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but unfortunately
that did not happen,'' he said.
   The prosecutor said West German investigators had been hampered
because law only allows wiretaps to investigate more serious crimes
like murder. A telephone tap would have enabled West German
authorities to trace the suspect's calls.
   Computer hackers use telephone connections to gain unauthorized
access to other computers, often just for fun.
   Bock said the computer connections in this case were made by
telephone via a computer at Bremen University.
   Quick said a connection with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
allowed the hacker to link to computers worldwide. However, the
magazine did not provide further details or identify the hacker.
   Bock said he could provide no details about the hacker because
the West German investigation had been dropped.
   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986
by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which does broad-based
unclassified research.
   The laboratory and its companion institution, the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which researches nuclear weapons and the
Reagan administratoin's space-based missile defense system, are
operated by the University of California for the U.S. government.
   Quick said authorities questioned the suspect in June and that
the break-ins stopped at about the same time.

   Hackers penetrated a non-classified
Defense Department computer network last month, rummaging through
data at a Navy base, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and at least
one other center, the space agency said Thursday.
   The break-in occurred the night of May 16 and lasted into the
early morning hours of May 17, but no damage was done, said Haskell
G. O'Brien, the laboratory's manager of communications and
computing network services.
   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigating
the details of this,'' O'Brien told a news conference.
   It was unknown whether more than one person was involved or if
the break-in was achieved from inside or outside the United States,
O'Brien said. Unauthorized computer access is illegal, he added.
   Thousands of computers are linked to the network at hundreds of
U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, including
military research centers and other National Aeronautics and Space
Administration offices, he said.
   O'Brien described it as a non-classified network for sharing
scientific information. The network, named ARPANET, is operated by
the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   He said he considered the incident serious because programs used
to design microcircuits could have been damaged and because ``if
someone burglarizes my house, I'm offended. If someone accesses my
computer, I'm equally offended.''
   ``The Department of Defense regards as serious any attempt to
gain unauthorized access to its computer systems,'' Pentagon
spokeswoman Susan Hansen said in Washington. ``Let me assure you,
however, that there is no indication that any classified
information has been obtained by such hacker activity.''
   The break-in was the third known violation of computer security
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in two years, O'Brien said. He
cited a previously publicized August 1986 break-in by a West German
hacker, or computer buff, and another last summer, in which the
perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.
   O'Brien said the hacker in last month's incident first gained
access to the Pentagon network through another computer at an
undisclosed location. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password _
the name of a JPL employee _ to enter the lab's computer, he added.
   The hacker then used the JPL computer as a conduit to enter
another ARPANET computer at Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland,
where authorities noticed something was amiss and notified the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, O'Brien said. He added that he didn't know
how many other computers also were penetrated.
   The lab's chief spokesman, George Alexander, initially said
members of the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, broke
into the Digital Equipment Corp. computer at the laboratory, but he
later retracted the statement.
   ``We don't know for a fact that it was Chaos. ... There are
things that make us suspicious, but the bottom line fact is we
don't know,'' Alexander said.
   ``They're not kids,'' Alexander said of the club's members.
``They're adults. They are a worrisome group to American computer
experts. They're not just hackers doing pranks. They are group
whose motives and aims are not entirely clear.''
   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, West
Germany, that he was unaware of the break-in, but would check into
the matter further.
   ``One thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is they (the
hackers) didn't get into any classified data banks nor did they get
into any sensitive information in the lab,'' Alexander said.
   Alexander said that as soon as the break-in was discovered, ``we
pulled JPL out of the network.''
   Several days after the break-in, Digital Equipment and JPL
officials ``rebuilt the system to make sure that if they (hackers)
planted any viruses, we were not going to continue using the
operating system they had been mucking around with,'' he said.
   A computer virus is a program surreptitiously inserted into a
computer to disrupt its normal program.
   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old
West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.
military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were
detected in August 1986.
   Targets included computers at JPL, the Air Force Systems Command
in El Segundo, Calif., and at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in
Berkeley, Calif.
   In September, members of Chaos Computer Club announced that
youths who weren't club members used home computers to break into a
NASA computer information network used by at least nine nations,
and that they obtained secrets about the U.S. space program.
   The club said the hackers gained regular access to at least 20
NASA computers between May and September 1987 through a flaw in the
security system.
   At the time, NASA officials in Washington denied that secret
information had been obtained through its computer network.

<HEAD>Hackers Convicted of Selling Computer Codes to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CELLE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three West German hackers were found
guilty today of selling Western military computer codes to the
Soviet KGB and given suspended sentences ranging from 14 months to
two years.
   Dirk Brzezinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested in
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed the three had obtained passwords and codes giving them
access to key military and research computers in the United States,
Western Europe and Japan.
   A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
   At the trial, which began Jan. 11, all three admitted guilt in
obtaining the codes to sell them to a Soviet KGB agent in East
Berlin.
   In today's decision, Chief Judge Leopold Spiller said the three
were given suspended sentences because ``it could not be proven
that substantial damage had been done to the Federal Republic (West
Germany) or its NATO partners.'' But Spiller also said the three
sold the computer codes for money.
   Carl was sentenced to 24 months, Hess 20 months and Brzezinski
14 months.
   All three men were freed on suspended sentences as long as they
stay out of trouble with the law for the duration of their terms.
   Carl, 35, told the court during the trial that he could only
identify the KGB agent he dealt with as ``Serge'' and said he did
not wish to reveal anything more about the Soviets in open court
for fear of reprisals.
   Court records show that Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total $54,500 for the computer information,
which was split among the hackers, amateurs who figure out ways to
access private computer systems.
   Brzezinksi, 30, told the court that Koch had the original idea
of selling the information to the KGB.
   According to Brzezinski, Koch claimed he had gained access to
the U.S. Defense Department general databank known as Optimus.
   U.S. and West German news media reported the hackers also gained
access to a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, and
computers linked to nuclear weapons and energy research in New
Mexico and the Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
   However, U.S. officials said last year that although the hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and
passwords for computers in Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany were also obtained and sold to the
Soviets by the hackers.

   The Soviet Union lodged a ``resolute protest''
over the expulsion of a military attache allegedly involved in a spy
operation aimed at learning how the U.S. government protects
computer secrets.
   Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, 35, was told to leave
Thursday. An FBI investigation had led to his arrest Wednesday
night, just a day after the Bush administration opened a high-level
dialogue with the Soviet Union.
   Pakhtusov was described by a U.S. source as a significant catch
because he is a member of the Red Army's GRU intelligence arm. One
official said Pakhtusov was caught ``red-handed.''
   But the Soviet Embassy issued a statement saying the expulsion
order ``could be only qualified as a deliberate provocation against
a Soviet diplomatic official.''
   It denied that Pakhtusov engaged in any wrongdoing and said the
embassy has lodged a ``resolute protest'' with the State Department.
   Asked about the Soviet allegations today, department spokesman
Charles Redman said, ``The reason for our actions is very simple. He
was caught red-handed with the goods and no amount of verbiage can
change that.''
   Redman added that the Soviets have informed the United States
that Pakhtusov will be leaving as requested.
   He said there is no reaosn to believe the incident will affect
U.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviets are aware that the United States
will protect its national security interests whenever it's
threatened, he said.
   State Department press officer Dennis Harter said the Soviet
Embassy was informed that Pakhtusov was being expelled for
``activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
   According to one government source, Pakhtusov was asked to leave
by Saturday.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov called the
expulsion a ``gross provocation'' at a regularly scheduled news
briefing today in Moscow, but he did not announce any retaliatory
Soviet action.
   He said ``the U.S. side is assuming all the responsibilities'' of
the decision to expel Pakhtusov.
   Repeatedly asked by reporters whether Pakhtusov was engaged in
spying, Gerasimov responded: ``He did not violate diplomatic status
with whatever he did.''
   Violating diplomatic status is an oft-used diplomatic euphemism
for spying.
   In Vienna on Tuesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
for the first time with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and announced plans for a visit to Moscow in May.
   The FBI probe was set in motion in August, two months after
Pakhtusov's arrival, when he approached an American employee of a
company that deals in classified information.
   The American, who was not identified, reported the contact to the
FBI, which began monitoring contacts between the two.
   There is growing evidence that the Soviets are placing high
priority on gaining access to Western computers with sensitive
military, nuclear and space research information stored inside them.
   A week ago, West German authorities charged a computer hacker
with espionage and said a total of eight people were suspected of
selling sensitive computer data from the United States and allied
countries to the Soviets from 1986 through last year.
   The German action was described by officials as the first
confirmed case of Soviet computer espionage. A State Department
official, who asked not to be identified, said there was no
connection between the German and Pakhtusov cases.
   From Moscow the official Soviet news agency Tass today expressed
outrage at the expulsion and reported that Pakhtusov was arrested
while taking out the garbage at his home in Virginia.
   Neither Tass nor other Soviet media said whether there would be
any retaliatory action taken against Americans in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet interest in penetrating Western computer banks has added a
new dimension to the ongoing effort to make stored data secure
without making it inaccessible to those with a legitimate need for
it.
   Previously, the problem had been limited to hackers who try to
penetrate computers as a hobby.
   Pakhtusov is the first publicly acknowledged case of a Soviet
envoy being expelled by the United States since December 1987, when
Mikhail Kathov, second secretary at the Soviet mission to the United
Nations, was ordered home for trying to obtain information on
military technology.
   In September 1986, the Reagan administration, alleging widespread
spying activities, ordered the expulsion in stages of 105 Soviets
from Moscow's U.N. mission. The Soviets retaliated by expelling a
number of American diplomats from Moscow.

   A West German computer ``hacker''
electronically raided about 50 U.S. military computers containing
defense and aerospace information, a prosecutor said today.
   The 24-year-old student gained access to the computers for
almost two years through his own computer and telephone links,
according to the West German newsmagazine Quick.
   Some of the raided computers are at the Air Force Systems
Command in El Segundo, Calif., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasedena, Calif., said Hans-Georg von Bock, prosecuting attorney
in Bremen.
   FBI spokesmen said their agency was investigating. They declined
to say whether charges would be filed.
   Bock refused to say what the student, who is from Hanover,
discovered in his computer break-ins. Quick said the student was
able to find out the names of U.S. Army officers in Japan and
details about U.S. coastal security systems.
   However, no one said whether the man uncovered any important
secrets.
   Bock said Bremen authorities had abandoned their inquiry for
lack of evidence. Bock refused to provide any details about the
suspect _ including his name _ because the investigation had been
dropped.
   ``We wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but
unfortunately that did not happen,'' Bock said.
   He said the electronic links were made by telephone via a
computer at Bremen University.
   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven who
originated these calls,'' Bock said.
   Hackers are computer enthusiasts who try to gain unauthorized
access to other computers through telephone lines. Some hackers say
they commit their electronic break-ins just for fun.
   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986
by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., which does
unclassified research. The laboratory and its sister institution,
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which is involved in nuclear
weapons research and the Strategic Defense Initiative known as
``Star Wars,'' are operated by the University of California for the
U.S. government.
   Quick said authorities questioned the student in June and the
break-ins stopped at about that time.
   Bock said West German investigators had been handicapped because
German law prevents them from tapping telephones unless they
suspect a more serious crime, such as murder.

   Many U.S. and European officials fear improved
relations will lead to even more rapid acquisition by the Soviet
bloc, legally and illegally, of the West's sensitive military
technology.
   American officials say the Soviets spend at least $1 billion a
year to obtain Western technology and often will pay more than
three times market value for something they want.
   Analysts say the Soviets obtain high technology with the help of
unscrupulous Western businessmen who may acquire the goods legally,
then divert them to the East illegally. Soviet agents get other
material through espionage.
   The diversions are taking place in the more relaxed atmosphere
created by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's peace and disarmament overtures,
which have altered Western perceptions of the Soviet threat.
   ``There is no sign that Soviet efforts have diminished, and
evidence is that they are increasing,'' said William Waldegrave,
Britain's deputy foreign secretary.
   Francois Heisbourg, head of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, said losses now may surpass those of
the late 1970s, when Soviet agents penetrated key ministries in
France and West Germany.
   ``We will see an enormous draw from the West,'' said John
Galvin, the American general who commands NATO forces in Europe.
``We'll probably lose the technological edge we've had for
decades.''
   The United States and 16 allies belong to the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as CoCom, which
tries to stem the flow of sensitive military goods to the Soviet
bloc.
   Stephen Bryen, former U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for
trade security, estimated Western businessmen smuggled items worth
up to $2 billion to the Soviet East in 1988.
   Recent diversions and thefts, analysts say, have allowed Soviet
engineers to make more accurate missiles, quieter submarines and
stronger aircraft wings, and to clone advanced computers they might
have taken years to develop.
   They say the Soviets also are acquiring such new battlefield
technology as helicopter weapons systems and tank armor, and
Western experts worry that the trend to greater trade between East
and West will increase the flow.
   ``There is no question they are ... on a path toward getting
more technology,'' said Richard Perle, a former top Pentagon
official who championed export controls. ``We certainly gave away a
lot during detente, and this looks like a rerun.''
   Gorbachev's ambitious plan to modernize the Soviet economy has
created intense interest in Western business circles.
   Dozens of Western companies are entering joint ventures that
eventually may offer Soviet consumers a variety and quantity of
goods and services not available now. Joint ventures also may
provide Western technology, money and management expertise
Gorbachev sorely needs.
   Some Western allies urge caution lest such cooperation allow the
Soviets to concentrate its scarce resources on defense projects,
but others want to help Gorbachev's liberalization program.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said
recently: ``In view of the great economic problems confronting the
Soviet Union, as well as its process of restructuring, a Western
readiness for cooperation in the economic sector is strongly
needed, not least in our own interest.''
   An American serving in Paris said privately that, if the thaw
continues, ``it will probably be more and more difficult to
maintain the support for CoCom that we've had.''
   John C. Kelley Jr., director of strategic investigations for the
U.S. Customs Service in Washington, said increased trade will
provide ``more opportunity to mask some of the items and ...
commingle more high-technology merchandise'' with legitimate goods.
   CoCom, based in Paris, regulates shipments of weapons, nuclear
technology and ``dual-use'' products, such as communications
equipment, that have both commercial and military applications.
   Aaron Karp of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute said Soviet engineers now are seeking manufacturing
processes rather than single items.
   In March, West German authorities accused several German
computer hackers of pirating technical data from the Pentagon and
research centers in the United States, Europe and Japan over two
years. Investigators say the hackers sold it to the Soviets for
money and drugs.
   Authorities said the information helped Soviet engineers read
data in some crucial industrial and military installations.
   ``This is a new quality of espionage by the East,'' said Gerhard
Boemen, chief of West German intelligence services.
   Espionage successes for the Soviets mean Western researchers
must invest heavily to find something better than what has been
lost.
   NATO officials say a spy ring in the U.S. Army in West Germany,
broken up last August, gave the Kremlin even more sensitive
information than originally believed.
   Italian authorities charged two men in February with selling
secrets about a computer system being developed for the alliance.
   French police seized a disassembled particle accelerator packed
in 18 crates and destined for the Soviet Academy of Sciences in
Moscow. The police arrested Aime Richardt, who was implicated in
previous cases. French customs charged that the machine is used to
accelerate heavy ions, which gives it military applications. But
Richardt claimed it was an accelerator of light ions and was
suitable only for scientific research. The case is still pending in
a French court.
   Viktor Karpov, the Soviet arms negotiator, laughed when asked
whether Moscow's theft of technology had increased.
   ``Look at that Florida case,'' he said. ``The man tried to sell
to the FBI, not the KGB.''
   A former defense worker in Florida had called the Soviet Embassy
to offer plans. FBI agents on the line arrested him.

   Three West Germans ``hackers'' went
on trial Thursday charged with selling Western military computer
passwords and codes to the Soviets.
   Dirk Brzesinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested last
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed they had obtained information giving them access to key
military and research computers in the United States, Western
Europe and Japan.
   A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
   Brzesinski, 30, a computer specialist, told the court that Koch
had come up with the idea of selling the information.
   ``We decided in 1986 to sell the information to the Soviets for
1 million marks ($605,000) to help them even out the technical
know-how advantage of the West,'' Brzesinski said.
   Carl, 35, said he was responsible for contacting the Soviet
trade mission in East Berlin, where he dealt with a contact
identified only as ``Serge.''
   Carl said he did not want to reveal anything more about the
Soviets in court for fear of reprisals.
   Court records show Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total of 90,000 marks ($54,500) for the
information.
   According to Brzesinski, Koch before his death claimed he had
managed to gain access to the U.S. Defense Department general
databank known as Optimus.
   After the arrests last year, U.S. and West German news media
reported that other computers the hackers entered included a NASA
and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, as well as computers linked
to nuclear weapons and energy research in Los Alamos, N.M., and the
Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
   However, U.S. officials said last year that although the hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators have said that codes and passwords from computers
in Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany were
also obtained and sold to the Soviets.
   A verdict in the trial, scheduled to be completed in 12
sessions, is expected Feb. 8. The men face up to 15 years in prison
each if convicted.

<TEXT>
   A court convicted three West German
hackers on Thursday of selling Western military computer codes to
the Soviet KGB secret police, and gave them suspended sentences
ranging from 14 months to two years.
   Chief Judge Leopold Spiller said sentences were suspended
because ``it could not be proven that substantial damage had been
done to ... (West Germany) or its NATO partners'' through the
hackers' actions. But he also said the three purposely sold the
computer codes for money to the KGB.
   Court records show one defendant, Peter Carl, made at least 25
contacts with the Soviets and received $54,500 for the computer
information, which he split with the others.
   Carl, 35; computer specialist Dirk Brzezinski, 30; and computer
programmer Markus Hess, 28, were arrested in March 1989 after an
investigation by U.S. and West German officials revealed they had
obtained passwords and codes giving them access to major military
and research computers in the United States, Western Europe and
Japan.
   Carl drew 24 months; Hess, 20 months; and Brzezinski, 14 months.
   A fourth man, Karl Koch, 30, was arrested in the case, but
committed suicide last May.
   U.S. officials said last year that the hackers were stopped
short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and
passwords for computers in Japan, Britain, France, Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany were also obtained and sold to the
Soviet by the hackers.
   All three defendants admitted guilt in obtaining codes to sell
to a Soviet KGB agent in East Berlin.
   At the trial, which began on Jan. 11, Carl testified he could
identify the agent only as ``Serge'' and said he did not wish to
reveal anything more about the Soviets in open court for fear of

   London police said Sunday that they tracked down
an unemployed computer hacker who tapped into military, commercial
and university systems in Europe and the United States over several
years.
   They said the man was questioned about alleged attempts to
blackmail a computer company but that there was not enough evidence
to pursue the matter.
   ``He was officially cautioned about that but, as he wasn't
charged with anything, we are not identifying him,'' said a
spokeswoman at Scotland Yard.
   A Scotland Yard statement said only that the man was 23 and out
of work. It said the inquiry by its Serious Crimes Squad lasted
five weeks.
   The Sunday Telegraph, which broke the story, said the man was
connected with an ``international ring of computer hackers who have
penetrated the electronic information systems of more than 200
sensitive military and commercial establishments.''
   It said the computer systems penetrated included NASA, the U.S.
Nuclear Defense Agency, the British Defense Ministry, ``as well as
those of American defense establishments and suppliers.''
   The weekly said American security experts were going to London
to examine papers found during the police investigation which gave
details of hacking activities over five years.
   The newspaper said the man used computers on the University of
Surrey campus at Guildford, 30 miles southwest of London, and had
not committed any offense under British law.
   It said the man's hacking included finding out details of
people's financial accounts and that his motive appeared to have
been the ``pleasure of beating the system.''
   It reported he had contacts with unidentified hacking clubs in
the United States and with one in West Germany ``which specializes
in gaining access to military systems. But there is no suggestion
that he tried to disclose secrets to foreign countries,'' the
report added.
   The newspaper said the alleged blackmail attempt originated with
a request to a large computer firm for a $5,250 fee to be shown how
its equipment had been used to tap different computer systems.
   The firm went to the police, who traced the hacker to one of
Surrey University's 900 terminals and trapped the man when the
university collaborated in setting up a terminal programed to
monitor external computer calls, the newspaper said.

   The Common Market has agreed to cut its
use of chlorofluorocarbons, the synthetic compounds that destroy the
Earth's ozone layer, by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its
production by the end of the century.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, invented in 1930, are used in aerosol
sprays, refrigeration coolants, cleaning agents and several other
products. The compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer
that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays and
for an increase in skin cancer.
   Environmental officials meeting in Brussels agreed Thursday to
give the 12 EEC member nations a mandate to completely phase out the
manufacture and use of the compounds by the year 2000. In
Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
Reilly urged President Bush to support the chlorofluorocarbon
phase-out by the end of the century. But his proposal was not
immediately endorsed by the administration, the Washington Post

   The Bush administration is proposing a new U.S.
policy toward Central America that includes rewards for Nicaragua if
it passes certain ``checkpoints'' on the road to democracy, say
congressional and administration sources.
   While still in its formative stages, the new policy is outlined
in a secret 10-page document Secretary of State James A. Baker III
showed to House and Senate leaders Thursday during a hastily
arranged visit to Capitol Hill. Baker made clear to lawmakers that
he does not intend to abandon the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
   He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the U.S.
``humanitarian'' aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a
year, according to some present at the meetings. Aid would continue
to flow at current rates _ about $4 million a month _ and would keep
the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after
Nicaragua's national elections, which are being moved up to early
1990.

   A Harvard astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an
international electronic spy ring in West Germany by tracking down
the ``hacker'' who broke into his computer files.
   For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonely
obsession for 38-year-old Clifford Stoll, who initially was unable

   On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of
three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer
passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon has
not determined the extent of the damage to U.S. security. A West

   U.S. mortality rates for two of the three leading
causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are headed downward,
but cancer is on the increase as unhealthy habits of yesteryear
catch up with the older population.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that the U.S. death
rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100,000 people, down
from 318 the year before. For stroke, or cerebrovascular disease,
the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from 62.
   But the mortality rate from cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer,
has been going up in recent years, the CDC said. There were 196
cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100,000 Americans, up from 195 the

   A city program considered a national model for

``intrusive'' by the state Supreme Court, a ruling officials say
could halt contracting for months.
   The court based Thursday's 7-0 decision on a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling in January that overturned a similar program in Richmond, Va.
It was the high court's first reversal of an affirmative action
program after years of upholding them.
   The state court said Atlanta failed to produce enough evidence of
past discrimination to justify its program. It also said the program
was too broadly drawn and that the city had not considered ``less
intrusive'' methods of increasing minority participation in city
contracts. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf
of the American Subcontractors Association effectively dismantles
the program.

allegedly spring to life to destroy all the hard disk data on thousands of 
IBM-compatible personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Picture someone sneaking into your office and torching every item in your files 
-- letters, reports, memos. Everything. Multiply that by thousands and you have 
computerdom's equivalent to Hurricane Hugo. This current threat may be just the 
latest round of media hype, but IBM, AT&amp;T and the federal government are 
taking this virus very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The metaphor is apt: Viruses are little program-lettes designed to make 
computers sick. They're spread by computer telecommunications networks and by 
tainted floppy disks. This isn't like traditional computer hacking, where 
people break into systems for the heck of it. Breaking into a system to look 
around is one thing; planting a virus that destroys people's work is both cruel 
and malicious. 
</P>
<P>
To make an analogy, if a teen-age kid takes a car on a joy ride and returns it, 
he has unquestionably committed a crime, but his intent is clearly not 
malicious. If, however, our teen jiggered the engine to break down or explode 
when someone else drove the car, it's clear that he's a psycho who should do 
hard time. 
</P>
<P>
Too many of these creatures fancy themselves as the Jasons, Freddie Krugers and 
Michael Myerses of software -- they think that they're stars of a digital 
slasher pic. They mutilate data as mindlessly as their screen idols skewer 
teens. The computer networks serve as their masks and machetes. And, like their 
gore-spattered role models, if they don't get caught, you have to put up with a 
sequel. 
</P>
<P>
These virus sleazoids raise very important questions about the future of 
personal computing: Do viruses represent an aberrant phase or an ongoing 
phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
"Most people now understand that writing a virus is a genuinely bad thing," 
says Clifford Stoll, an astronomer turned network security expert who helped 
crack a computer-based West German spy ring. "Two or three years ago, it was 
possible to write a completely innocuous virus. Today, you can't, because you 
can't be sure innocent people won't get hurt. If a hospital gets a 'HA! HA! I 
GOT YOU!' virus that freezes up its computer, that can have a disastrous impact 
even though the virus is intended to be innocuous." You simply can't know what 
systems a virus will infect anymore. 
</P>
<P>
My belief is that, as with folks who love slasher flicks, we are dealing with a 
declining quantity of deviants. The overwhelming majority of computerniks are 
more intent on demonstrating how clever they are rather than how destructive 
they can be. Novelty, not perversion, intrigues them. These folks may still be 
inclined to take a Cray supercomputer for a joy ride if they get the chance. 
Troublemakers? Yes, but the focus isn't viral vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, viruses are fading as a hot topic among computer cognoscenti. 
"The virus is pretty much over," asserts Donn Parker, a longtime computer 
security expert at SRI International in Palo Alto. "The real question is, what 
will the next crimeoid be?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the right question because truly gifted (and dangerous) technoids find 
virgin technology more intriguing than yesterday's hack. Parker suggests that 
"voice mail hacking" may become the the next focus for malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of companies now rely on voice mail answering systems for eliminating 
telephone tag and speeding internal corporate communications. It's not that 
difficult to get into these systems and eavesdrop on and play back all the 
messages. Similarly, pranksters can use the technology to "broadcast" messages 
to all the phones in the company. Parker notes cases of voice mail terrorism 
where sickos use the knowledge they have gleaned from eavesdropping to 
broadcast threatening messages to individuals' phones. 
</P>
<P>
The point isn't that there are always sickos, it's that new technologies always 
invite experimentation. In the 1950s, it was hot-rodding and joy rides; in the 
1960s, it was psychedelic drugs; in the 1970s, it was telephone's blue box 
bandits, and the 1980s have seen the PC hackers and mini-plague of destructive 
viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's obvious that viruses such as Datacrime are slash-and-burn programs. 
There's no ambiguity surrounding them. My big fear is that the cleverer 
computerniks will move into the hazy arena of merry pranksterism and infect 
systems in ways they might consider clever or elegant. 
</P>
<P>
To wit, suppose this newspaper's computer system was infected with a virus that 
randomly deleted the word "not" from news stories and editorials? How about a 
"Robin Hood" virus that conned ATM machines into spewing out more money than 
requested after every Nth transaction? Not only would these viruses be 
difficult to detect, they probably wouldn't stir the sort of public/media 
outrage that other viruses do. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the sharp computerniks now enforce a code of honor that 
respects the clever and mischievous hack over the insidious and destructive 
virus. That is unlikely to change. The real risk is that really clever people 
will get caught up with how really clever they can be and blur the distinctions 
between pranks and vandalism. The next 48 hours may tell us a lot about the 
next few years.

<LEADPARA>  A computer "hacker" who was trying to help others steal electronic passwords
guarding large corporate computer systems around the country Friday pleaded
guilty to wire fraud in a continuing government crackdown on computer crime.; 
  Federal prosecutors recommended that Leonard Rose Jr., 32, of Middletown,

stiffest sentences imposed to date for computer crime. Sentencing is scheduled
for May before U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'HACKER' PLEADS GUILTY IN AT&amp;T CASE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 3/27/91, pg. 2F);  Because of an error by
the Washington Post, an article in Saturday's Mercury News gave incorrect
information about Leonard Rose Jr., the Maryland computer hacker who pleaded
guilty last week to two counts of wire fraud involving his illegal possession
of an American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. computer program. Rose was not a
member of the "Legion of Doom" computer hacking group and did not participate
in the group's alleged activities of breaking into and rummaging through
corporate and government computer systems.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Cases such as those of Rose and a Cornell University graduate student who
was convicted last year of crippling a nationwide computer network have shown
that the formerly innocent pastime of hacking has potentially extreme economic
ramifications. Prosecutors, industry officials and even some veteran hackers
now question the once popular and widely accepted practice of breaking into
computer systems and networks in search of information that may be shared with
others.;    "It's just like any other form of theft, except that it's more
subtle and it's more sophisticated," said Geoffrey R. Garinther, the assistant
U.S. attorney who prosecuted the Rose case.;    Rose -- once part of a group
of maverick hackers who called themselves the Legion of Doom -- and his
attorneys were not available for comment after the guilty plea Friday. The
single fraud count replaced a five-count indictment of the computer programmer
that was issued last May after a raid on his home by Secret Service agents.;  
 According to prosecutors, Rose illegally obtained information that would
permit him to secretly modify a widely used American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
Unix software program -- the complex instructions that tell computers what to
do. The two former AT&amp;T employees who provided these information "codes" have
not yet been prosecuted.;    Rose altered the AT&amp;T software by inserting a
"Trojan horse" program that would allow a hacker to secretly gain access to
computer systems using the AT&amp;T Unix software and gather passwords used on the
system. The passwords could then be distributed to other hackers, permitting
them to use the system without the knowledge of its rightful operators,
prosecutors said.;    Rose's modifications made corporate purchasers of the
$77,000 AT&amp;T Unix program vulnerable to electronic break-ins and the theft of
such services as toll-free 800 numbers and other computer-based
telecommunications services.;    After changing the software, Rose sent it to
three other computer hackers, including one in Chicago, where authorities
learned of the scheme through a Secret Service computer crime investigation
called Operation Sun Devil. Officials say they do not believe the hackers ever
broke into computer systems.;    At the same time he pleaded guilty here, Rose
pleaded guilty to a similar charge in Chicago.;    Rose and his associates in
the Legion of Doom connected their computers by telephone to corporate and
government computer networks, outwitted security screens and passwords to sign
onto the systems and rummaged through the information files they found,
prosecutors said.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Worried Lawrence Livermore Lab Asks For Hacker Contact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker who has breached
low-level security at a top federal weapons laboratory about 10
times in the past week is being urged by officials to contact the
lab ``to find out what he wants.''
   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has spent nearly
$100,000 in lost resources and attempts to stop the invader, who
gains access through a national computer communications network, lab
officials estimated.
   No files or data in the computers appear to have been altered.
   ``I've offered an invitation for him to call me through the
media,'' said Charles Cole, the lab's computer security manager.
``I'd like to talk to him. My number's listed, or if he called the
laboratory he could get me very easily.''
   Lab officials also are considering trying to contact the hacker
the next time he logs onto their computers by leaving a message for
him.
   ``In one sense it would be nice if (the hacker) went away, but
I'd rather he stayed with us for a while so we can find out what he
wants,'' Cole said.
   ``What worries me is where is he (in the system) that we don't
know about,'' he added.
   The lab, run by the University of California Berkeley, is one of
the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing of
nuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.
   No classified computer systems have been affected, Cole said.
   The hacker appeared in the lab's computers last weekend and has
been on and off the system ever since. The most recent appearance
was Thursday night, Cole said.
   ``As best we can determine, he hasn't altered anything with the
exception of creating a password for himself so he can get back
on,'' he said, adding:
   ``But he hasn't done anything really destructive on the system,
and before he would be inclined to do that I hope he would talk to
me about what his problem is.''
   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a
computer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by another
hacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were through
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access
points that have not been patched.
   Cole said the intrusions do not involve a virus, a program that
can order a computer to replicate itself or send it on to another
computer. ``This attack is being done by someone or a group who are
maneuvering into the system manually,'' he said.
   The hacker has already broken federal laws which prohibit
unauthorized use of federal computer systems, Cole said, and he may
have violated state laws as well.
   Cole speculated that the hacker is simply ``joy riding.''
   It was determined that Stanford University and the University of
Washington were gateways from which the hacker entered the Livermore
system by means of the Internet communications system, but it is not
known if the hacking originated there.
   Part of the problem in tracing a hacker on Internet is that it is
so large. Internet is used by research facilities and military
contractors nationwide and there is no single path through which
messages must travel.
   The lab has closed the holes which they believe the hacker used.
But a couple of computers have been left unprotected in an attempt
to make contact or trace the person.
   ``We could close up our system, in which case he would move on,''
Cole said.

   Hackers Open Voice-Mail Door to Others' Phone Lines

   Those friendly electronic voice-mail systems that take
messages at many offices are being put to a more sinister use
by computer hackers.
   In the past six months, computer hackers in the U.S. and
Canada have been systematically stealing phone records and
using local and toll-free 800 phone numbers to gain access to
office voice-mail systems around the country, allowing them
to use the office phones for their own purposes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The size of the intrusion is still being gauged by the
Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but
it certainly involves "hundreds of companies and government
offices," says Earl Devaney, special agent in charge of the
Secret Service's Fraud Division. "If it continues increasing
at the rate we're seeing," Mr. Devaney adds, "it could run
into the tens of millions of dollars in losses" in fraudulent
phone bills for business and agencies.
   Current voice-mail systems are vulnerable because their
access codes are relatively easy to crack. Once hackers
calling from outside an office break a code and take control
of an extension, they have several options. They can use the
line to make long-distance calls, at the company's expense.
They can leave and receive messages.
   "The hacker calls on our 800 line for free," says Wes
Winchester, a data-processing systems coordinator at the U.S.
Postal Service Center in New Brunswick, N.J. "He creates a
mailbox for himself, say on extension 5001, and then tells
the system to forward the messages {for him} by calling his
house. Our system gets charged for those calls."
   Some hackers even change the company password, rendering
the voice system inaccessible to employees trying to retrieve
their messages. "I pushed my access code in, and the system
wouldn't accept it," says Phillip Cassidy, finance and
leasing manager for U-Save Auto Rental of America Inc.,
Hanover, Md. "The hacker had locked it up."
   Vincent Howley, U-Save's executive vice president adds:
"They're giving out company phone numbers across the country,
in Jersey, California. They have the capacity to cause major
problems."
   This isn't the first time that hackers have penetrated the
nation's phone system. Last November, two teen-agers from
Staten Island, N.Y., allegedly gained unauthorized entry to a
computerized voice-mail system owned by International Data
Group, Framingham, Mass., then changed recorded greetings to
lewd messages, made bomb threats and erased customers'
messages. Earlier last year, a group of California hackers
allegedly breached computer systems at Pacific Bell and a
secure computer system used by the U.S. Army to intercept
phone information.
   Long-distance phone companies, long victimized by phone
fraud, began moving aggressively against crooks a few years
ago. The phone companies lengthened the authorization access
codes used to charge calls to more than 10 digits, making
them harder to crack. They also worked with law enforcement
authorities to raid offenders' homes and businesses. Now a
problem that cost the industry tens of millions of dollars in
revenues seems to be subsiding, according to Robert Fox,
assistant vice president of security at U S Sprint
Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.
   Computer hackers, however, are finding new victims. "They
have migrated away from the long-distance carriers and find
it safer to attack a company's phone system, which usually
uses four- to seven-digit access codes," Mr. Fox says. "It's
a lot easier to get a dial tone through that kind of phone
system."
   Hackers gain access to corporate voice-mail systems in a
variety of ways. The toll-free 800 numbers supplied to
corporate and government phone customers by long-distance
carriers, plus other sensitive phone records, are stored in
data banks owned by local phone companies. A hacker using a
personal computer and modem can break into these data banks
through phone lines and steal customer records showing phone
numbers and voice-mail access codes. The hacker can then use
this information to manipulate voice-mail systems.
   Once inside a system, hackers may use a stolen password to
get a dial tone from the company's phone line, and then "the
real trouble begins," says the Secret Service's Mr. Devaney.
"They make long-distance calls around the world, and the
company doesn't find out it has a problem until 30 to 60 days
after the intrusion, when it gets its phone bill."
   Hackers can also change passwords or create mailboxes in
phantom phone extensions. Mr. Winchester noticed the problem
at the Postal Service office when its phone system's
data-storage unit became overloaded. "We also saw phony boxes
for extensions that didn't exist," he says.
   Some of the messages left by hackers are downright nasty.
At Health Management Strategies International Inc.,
Alexandria, Va., a hacker took over a mailbox and left a
message that identified a Las Vegas, Nev., man by his name,
age and Social Security number and told fellow hackers to
inflict punishment on the man and his son. "I really want his
kid nailed," said the hacker. "Call up the utilities, give
his name, age and Social Security number and tell 'em you
want your electricity shut off. Then call the phone company
and do the same thing. Toast the dude."
   Another hacker left Visa credit card information for a
woman in Huntington Beach, Calif.
   Mr. Devaney recalls one hacker who "called a company and
said, `I am in control of your phone system. If you don't pay
me, I'll bring it crashing down.'" The hacker didn't make
good on his threat but wasn't caught.
   "Their boldness is fostered by their anonymity," Mr.
Devaney says. "They're sitting in a bedroom somewhere, not
robbing a bank where everyone can see them."
   The hackers themselves have taken names such as Ice Cube,
Tall Man from the Ministry of Fear and Uppercut. There's even
a guy named Techno, from Ultralogic, a group of Canadian
hackers who use Hewlett-Packard computers. "If you're
Canadian and know hacking, leave a message or call Global
Genocide," says Techno, leaving a number in Ontario.
   U-Save's Mr. Howley and others are having a hard time
figuring where to turn for help against phone fraud. The
Secret Service targets high-dollar, high-volume fraud, Mr.
Devaney says. The FBI usually doesn't investigate until the
local phone company asks it to. And long-distance companies
can't do much about people who dial phone numbers and reach
private phone systems that long-distance carriers don't
control.
   The real solution, says Richard Petillo, manager of
corporate security for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., is
for a company to beef up its own security. Hackers, he says,
"look to the most available and least protected of systems."

<P>
To hear it from the mavens of commercial surveillance, there is no such thing 
as paranoia: Your worst fears are probably true. If you think someone is taping 
your phone calls, bugging your office or reading what's in your computer, you 
are probably right. 
</P>
<P>
That fire sprinkler in the ceiling could be a camera; the person on the phone 
who says she is "Judy from accounting" could be an impostor; the janitor could 
be a private investigator ready for a session of "dumpster diving." 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, was the perspective permeating the air earlier this month at 
Surveillance Expo '89 at the Sheraton Washington, a showcase for an industry 
aimed at thwarting industrial spies, computer hackers and traitorous employees 
scheming to sell trade secrets, get back at the boss or embezzle. 
</P>
<P>
The conference provided an opportunity for equipment manufacturers, security 
managers and investigators to see the latest in the snoop and stymie business. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not merchants of fear; we are merchants of fact," said Dar Hyatt, the 
representative from Avtech Industries. The fact, however, seems to be: Don't 
trust anyone. Indeed, he said, "Ninety percent of the people who attend my 
stand (at trade shows) are crooks!" 
</P>
<P>
The crooks he was referring to are a new breed, skilled and professional, and 
often without any sense that what they are doing is wrong. Changing a number in 
a computer program may seem less criminal than holding up a service station, 
but it can be theft nonetheless -- albeit harder to detect and harder to prove. 
</P>
<P>
Given the murky legal options -- much of the frontier of computer crime and 
industrial espionage is uncharted legal territory -- many firms are looking to 
settle their problems themselves, hiring security firms to prevent abuses or to 
detect them when they occur. Security is a $14-billion industry, according to 
Frost and Sullivan Inc., which publishes reports with titles like "Access 
Control Equipment Market." 
</P>
<P>
People like Arthur Donnelly, a private investigator from New York who attended 
the conference, are part of the industry. Donnelly, a stocky, bearded fellow, 
is of the new breed of private investigator -- he doesn't try to get dirt on 
philandering spouses; he gets dirt on corporate executives. Or their employees. 
And things more mundane than that. 
</P>
<P>
Once, he said, he was hired by a bank that had lost $50 million worth of 
business by ignoring information about a new stock about to come on the market. 
The bank wanted to know who had been responsible for ignoring the tip. Another 
time he was hired by a fast-food chain to spy on a franchisee suspected of 
buying supplies from another source. Donnelly sat in his surveillance van, 
equipped with a periscope, and watched all the delivery trucks that came and 
went until he had clear evidence of bootleg buns. 
</P>
<P>
"Industrial espionage isn't just one company trying to find out trade secrets," 
said Donnelly during a break in the surveillance lectures. "Companies hire us 
to find out how their employees are reacting to a change, or to get information 
on the key executives in another company. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say Yuppie A Executive and Yuppie B Executive are at the same management 
level," Donnelly said. "They know they may one day be rivals for a higher 
position. So Yuppie A orders up an investigation of B, hoping to find something 
-- drug problem, a money problem, a woman problem -- that he can use against 
him later." 
</P>
<P>
One of Donnelly's favorite techniques is going undercover -- currently he is 
working as a data processor in a company to get information about employee 
reaction to a personnel change. He also has worked as a janitor, a systems 
director and a management trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite tactic -- and Donnelly is not alone in this -- is posing as a 
"market researcher" to get information from a particular company. Is it legal? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not criminal," said August Bequai, a Washington lawyer who led a seminar 
on the "Legal Loopholes of Corporate Espionage." But, he added, "You might find 
yourself sued." 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly also has gotten useful information from the trash -- a practice known 
as "dumpster diving." 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize what they throw out," he said. "And the Supreme Court has 
ruled that once you put it out it's public property." 
</P>
<P>
It was, he said, some clever dumpster diving by a private investigator that 
uncovered a recent Food and Drug Administration case against a manufacturer of 
phony generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
To protect himself from his peers, Donnelly has paper shredders in both his 
office and his home. He also has an unlisted home number and doesn't carry 
pictures of his wife and daughter in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly knows the electronics of the business -- laser listening devices that 
can pick up a conversation through walls, the radio monitors that can tune in 
calls made on cellular phones, the bugs that can be placed with ease in a room 
-- but two of his main tools are surprisingly old-fashioned. One is a colleague 
who can read lips; the other is the public library. While Donnelly tracks 
people and paper for clients, Susan Headley has been one of the people he might 
have found. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described former hacker, she now is a professional poker player in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Headley, who goes by the hacker handle Susie Thunder, described herself as a 
self-taught expert. 
</P>
<P>
At age 8, she built a "black box," one of those illegal devices that allowed 
her to make free long-distance telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting white cowboy boots and a purple tie-dyed, studded dress that made her 
a standout in the crowd, Headley was at the convention to give a seminar on the 
"psychological subversion of EDP (electronic data processing) systems." 
</P>
<P>
Her fascination is figuring out how to circumvent security systems, a talent 
she developed as a teen-ager at rock 'n' roll concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Having conquered the world of bodyguards and backstage passes, she fell in with 
a group of teen-age computer hackers and soon was ready to tackle any computer 
system as long as she had a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
She is blunt and open about her colorful past, she said, to create awareness 
about how easy it is to invade computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has inveigled free tickets for airline flights and concerts, set 
herself up as a phantom employee of a telephone company to have access to its 
systems and indulged in other hacker tricks. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by about 600 people, somewhat fewer than organizer 
James A. Ross had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
A man from the Department of Defense gave an illustrated lecture on terrorism 
that was well attended, and Barbara A. Rowan, an Alexandria, Va., consultant on 
white-collar crime, lectured on the legality of recording telephone 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of talks about computer security, and an exhibit hall that 
featured an assortment of what industry wags refer to as "toys," ranging from a 
television camera in a tie clip to the latest in penetration-proof rooms.

Ian Murphy Helps Companies
Catch Computer Pirates;
But Whose Side Is He On?

   It is almost 2 a.m., and the room is dark but for the phosphorous glow of the computer screen that illuminates the cherubic face of Capt. Zap. 
He taps the keyboard in his lap and searches for "hackers" who break into computer systems for fun or malice. 

   "We got one," Capt. Zap says. 
He starts an on-screen dialogue with the hacker and asks for phone numbers to corporate data bases that might be fun to hack into. 
The hacker advises that the best place to look tonight is the "Holiday Inn," a secret electronic bulletin board that lists such numbers. 
The captain heads thataway. 

   Capt. Zap, actually Ian A. Murphy, is well-known as one of the first convicted computer-hacker thieves. 
He has since reformed -- he swears it -- and has been resurrected as a consultant, working the other side of the bulletin boards and the right side of the law. 
His detractors doubt it. 

   Other consultants, many of them graying military veterans, try to flush out illicit hackers. 
But few boast the distinction of being a real hacker -- and one with a felony among his credentials. 
Capt. Zap is more comfortable at the screen than in a conversation. 
Asked to name his closest friend, he shakes his head and throws up his hands. 
He has none. 
"I don't like people," he says. 
"They're dreadful." 

   "He's legendary in the hacking world and has access to what's going on. 
That's a very valuable commodity to us," says Robert P. Campbell of Advanced Information Management in Woodbridge, Va., Mr. Murphy's mentor, who has hired him for consulting jobs. 

   The 30-year-old Mr. Murphy is well-connected into his nocturnal netherworld. 
Every night till 4 a.m., he walks a beat through some of the hundreds of electronic bulletin boards where hackers swap tales and techniques of computer break-ins. 
They trade passwords. 
They debate the fine points of stealing long-distance calls. 
They give tutorials: "Feds: How to Find and Eliminate Them." 

   It is very busy these nights. 
On the Stonehenge bulletin board, "The Marauder" has put up a phone number for Citibank's checking and credit-card records, advising, "Give it a call." 
On another board, Mr. Murphy finds a primer for rookie "hacklings," written by "The Knights of Shadow." 
On yet another, he sifts out network codes for the Defense Department's research agency. 

   He watches the boards for clients and warns when a system is under attack. 
For a fee of $800 a day and up, his firm, IAM/Secure Data Systems Inc., will test the security of a data base by trying to break in, investigate how the security was breached, eavesdrop on anyone you want, and do anything else that strikes his fancy as nerd vs. spy. 

   He says his clients have included Monsanto Co., United Airlines, General Foods Corp. and Peat Marwick. 
Some probably don't know he worked for them. 
His felony rap -- not to mention his caustic style -- forces him to work often under a more established consultant. 
"Ian hasn't grown up yet, but he's a technically brilliant kid," says Lindsey L. Baird, an Army veteran whose firm, Info-Systems Safeguards in Morristown, N.J., has hired Capt. Zap. 

   Mr. Murphy blames corporate "stupidity" and laziness for the hacker problem. 
He says companies aren't alarmed enough over the lapses, and he blares the blunt message on "Good Morning America," at industry seminars and in technical papers. 

   His kinds of services are much in demand these days, even if his blunt criticisms aren't. 
Computer break-ins cost companies millions of dollars each year in corporate espionage, fraud and hassle. 
The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Whinney puts computer-fraud losses at more than $3 billion a year. 

   Other experts say any figures are bogus because most thefts of data, software and such things as credit-card information aren't reported. 
Companies don't like admitting they were outfoxed by techies barely old enough to vote. 

   Lots of hackers have been busy lately. 
Agents recently busted "Shadow Hawk," 17-year-old Herbert Zinn of Chicago. 
He hacked into American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. systems and allegedly heisted software worth $1 million by "downloading" it to a home computer. 

   This summer, hackers in West Germany tapped into the U.S. space agency's European computer network, peeking at files on booster rockets and shuttle contracts. 
One of them changed a variable in a scientist's equation from pi (3.14159265) to 7, ruining two months of research. 

   Capt. Zap views this underworld from a frighteningly cluttered apartment on the city's ragged north side. 
Short and pudgy, he hovers at the screen surrounded by an electronic arsenal: closed-circuit video, printer, police radio, TV, eavesdropping gear, auto-dialer, shortwave radio, oscilloscopes and other gizmos. 

   "He's in control, it's his little world," says his wife, Carole Adrienne, who uses her psychology training to analyze the hacker mind-set. 
The place is so messy she refuses to live there. 
When they were first separated, Mr. Murphy admits he spied on her. 
"I'm an extremely jealous man," he says, "and I have the technology to stop any man." 
Says she: "You never know when the surveillance ends." 

   Mr. Murphy's electronic voyeurism started early. 
At age 14, he would sneak into the back yard to tap into the phone-switch box and listen to neighbors' calls. (He still eavesdrops now and then.) 
He quit high school at age 17. 
By 19 he was impersonating a student and sneaking into the computing center at Temple University to play computer games. 

   From there it was an easy transition to Capt. Zap's role of breaking in and peeking at academic records, credit ratings, a Pentagon list of the sites of missiles aimed at the U.S., and other verboten verbiage. 
He even left his resume inside Bell of Pennsylvania's computer, asking for a job. 

   The electronic tinkering got him into trouble in 1981. 
Federal agents swarmed around his parents' home in the wealthy suburb of Gladwyne, Pa. 
They seized a computer and left an arrest warrant. 
Capt. Zap was in a ring of eight hackers who ran up $212,000 in long-distance calls by using a "blue box" that mimics phone-company gear. 
They also ordered $200,000 in hardware by charging it to stolen credit-card numbers and using false mail drops and bogus purchase orders. 
Mr. Murphy was the leader because "I had the most contempt" for authority, he says. 

   In 1982, he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen goods and was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service and 2 1/2 years of probation. 
"It wasn't illegal. 
It was electronically unethical," he says, unrepentant. 
"Do you know anyone who likes the phone company? 
Who would have a problem with ripping them off?" 

   Mr. Murphy, who had installed commercial air conditioning in an earlier job, was unable to find work after his arrest and conviction. 
So the hacker became a hack. 
One day in his cab he picked up a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. manager while he was carrying a printout of hacker instructions for tapping into Dun's systems. 
Thus, he solicited his first consulting assignment: "I think you need to talk to me." 
He got the job. 

   Now Mr. Murphy treads a thin line between the hackers he reveres and the corporate clients he reviles. 
The line is so thin that critics doubt that his reformation is real. 
"Ian is a nice guy, I like him. 
I just don't trust his ethics. 
I think he's still on both sides of the law," says Carl Jackson, a security executive at Ford Motor Co. 

   Some say Mr. Murphy is more loyal to hackers than clients. 
He claims to employ the nation's top 10 hackers to break into client computers. 
This gives executives the jitters. 
Once hackers find a way in, while getting paid to do it, what is to stop them from breaking in again later on? 
Mr. Murphy won't disclose who is behind a break-in and won't help catch the culprit. 
He even advises hackers how to detect bugging by the feds. 
"I am not a bounty hunter," he says. 

   As a consultant, Mr. Murphy gets to do, legally, the shenanigans that got him into trouble in the first place. 
"When I was a kid, hacking was fun. 
Now I can make money at it and still have a lot of fun." 
He loves "tiger teaming," testing a client's security by breaking into his computer by any means necessary. 

   In tiger teaming, Mr. Murphy has even crawled through garbage bins in search of carelessly discarded passwords. (To demonstrate this on a moonlit walk at 3 o'clock one morning, he rips open a dozen trash bags outside an office building and exposes reams of papers.) 
Wearing a yellow slicker labeled "Bell of Pennsylvania," he bluffed his way into an insurance office posing as a repairman. 
Once inside, he made a beeline for the computer room. 
The inspiration for such capers? 
Old reruns of "Mission: Impossible," he says. 

   Some clients get queasy over his methods. 
Mr. Murphy had a row with Peat Marwick when one official balked at his criminal record and how he tiger-teamed the insurance office. 
Mr. Murphy says the accounting firm at first wouldn't pay him $24,000 he was owed, but it relented. 
Gary G. Goehringer, a Peat Marwick manager, confirms he hired Mr. Murphy for two jobs and stresses he was under close supervision at all times. 

   Now Ian Murphy looks to his next job. 
A Chicago company in a patent-infringement dispute suspects that a rival stole secrets by hacking into its computer system. 
Mr. Murphy may tiger-team the client's system to see whether getting in is doable. 
Better yet, he may break into the rival's computers to see whether the client's data are stored inside. 
He must check the legalities, or lack of them, for doing this. 

   Capt. Zap can barely wait.

   ``I was never popular, just a loner,'' Mark Duchaineau, a former
high school hacker, told Levy. ``You feel a oneness with the
computer. (Without it) there would have been this great void...like
you didn't have your sight or hearing.''
   ``There are a lot of bright kids, not socially well-developed,
who are miserable in junior high,'' says Mark Crispin, an author of
``The Hacker's Dictionary.'' ``They are naturally drawn to computer
hacking, something where they have complete control over the
results. Humans have basic needs and, if they don't get them out of
society, they'll get them elsewhere, and computers seem a better
answer than drugs.''

   Tenney is hacking in his basement in San Mateo. It looks like the
command module of a space capsule the morning after a Saturday night
linkup with some vodka-toasting Russkies:
   ``Computers are my hobby and my living. Hackers do it because
they enjoy it. That doesn't mean you can't think about money.''
   He speaks from experience with a wife and kids upstairs and a
diesel Cadillac with a blown head in the driveway. He programs
professionally to keep them respectively fueled.
   ``Hacking is the key to Silicon Valley. Woz (Steve Wozniak, the
legendary hacker who created the first Apple computer in a garage)
did it because he was interested in the challenge. Steve Jobs (Woz's
partner who turned the Apple into a multibillion-dollar orchard) saw
where it could go from the garage. That happens all the time out
here.'' A sum greater than its arts: synergy.
   ``If any company tells you they don't have any hackers on their
staff in the Valley, they're lying,'' says Leo Schwab, a young
hacker-programmer near San Rafael, Calif., a reputed wizard at
computer graphics.
   In hackerese, a wizard is a person permitted by the gods to do
things denied ordinary mortals.
   ``Hacking is a proud culture and rightly so,'' says Don Ingraham,
somewhat surprisingly since his job as assistant district attorney
for Alameda County (Oakland, Berkeley) is to track down computer bad
guys. ``These hackers working all night in their garages in Silicon
Valley and basements at MIT have pulled off miracles. They may well
be the salvation of our technology.''
   Japanese trains run on time but not because they've been hacked.
Nippon, collectively, makes great robots. America produces great
tinkerers, although a Japanese did ski down Everest, a most
celestial hack.

   Tenney is an anomaly, like a banana tree in Labrador. He emerged
not from the Valley or MIT but Chicago where hackers were ``computer
bums.'' By the time he was a high school senior, he had his own
office at the Illinois Institute of Technology. That was to make it
easier for him to tutor math teachers in computer familiarization
seminars, a child lecturing the pharisees at the temple.
   Even then something had evolved that Levy calls the Hacker Ethic.
This posited that access to computers and the data that fed them
should be free (keep in mind these were the '60s) and that hacking,
in and of itself and for the pure freedom of it, should be unimpeded
by the high priests of The Real World. Big Business. Big Brother.
Big Anybody. Computers promised a brave new world and all should
romp unhindered in Elysium.
   This has inevitably produced a gray, indeed very, very gray area
as to where hacking leaves off and the increasingly essential
networks of the nation's computers begin.

   He is called Captain Crunch, after the breakfast cereal. His real
name is John Draper.
   About 1970, while a soldier overseas, Draper found that the toy
whistle that came with each cereal box blew at 2,600 cycles, exactly
the pitch the phone company sang to. He began calling home _ free.
   Hacking Ma Bell became a challenge with electronic ``blue
boxes.'' Woz used to sell them dormitory-to-dormitory at Stanford.
(He could also arrange things so friends' computers would suddenly
light up with off-color Polish jokes.) You could ring up Sydney,
Australia, for nothing to get the Top Ten Tunes, try and give
Brezhnev a wakeup call.
   (Crunch, to whom Ingraham is a personal nemesis, finally went to
jail where he gave seminars to inmates on blue boxes. His back was
broken, Ingraham says, because his fellow cons felt he was
withholding technology. Draper, subsequently in the toils of the law
again, rigged Ingraham's computer to receive his legal bills.)
   Crunching _ and Morrising, if you will _ are deeds that have put
hacking in disrepute in The Real World. Stuart Brand, the
Californian who brought you ``The Whole Earth Catalog'' and now
provides a computer bulletin board in the Bay Area, is among many of
the old school who think everything, including copyrighted software,
should be free. But what of those, including numerous hackers, who
have devised brilliant software and then copyrighted it if only to
buy their groceries?
   ``When an artist produces art, he doesn't hang it in the
closet,'' Tenney reasons. ``He wants it to be seen.'' For nothing?
   ``A radical leftist hacker would say it's bad to let
establishment NCRs and IBMs use your stuff,'' says Poskanzer. ``A
radical leftit hacker would say you should not have sold it to IBM.
I say if they want to use it, fine. So I guess I'm a
middle-of-the-road hacker.''
   The Valley's annual Hacker Conference, which Tenney organizes and
Mandel attends as one of the 5 percent of ``necktie'' members
allowed to join, argues about free access at every meeting.
   Hackers agree the word ``hacking'' badly needs a euphemism. Their
fertile minds have added to the mother tongue such coinages as
gronk, to clear up, sort of; frobnicate, to adjust, as ``please
frobnicate the TV;'' dwim, forget it, move on to...; foo or bletch,
disgusting; moby foo, very disgusting; kluge, something that
shouldn't work but does; snarf, to snatch. But hackers have not come
up with a kinder, gentler term for what they do.

<TEXT>     The intruders, working over local telephone lines that enable them to tap
American computer networks at almost no cost, have not done serious damage,
federal investigators say.;    And they have not penetrated the most secure
government computer systems. But they have entered a wide range of computers,
including those at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet
Command, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Stanford University via an
international computer network known as the Internet.;    While the
information on these systems is not classified, the computers store a great
variety of material, including routine memorandums, unpublished reports and
data from experiments. Federal officials said the group had tampered with some
information stored on systems they have illegally entered.;    U.S. government
officials said they had been tracking the interlopers, but no arrests had been
made because there are no legal restrictions in the Netherlands barring
unauthorized computer access.;    "This has been a terrible problem," said
Gail Thackeray, a former Arizona assistant attorney general who has prosecuted
computer crimes. "Until recently there have been few countries that have
computer crime laws. These countries are acting as hacker havens.";    Dutch
TV report;  American law-enforcement officials said they believed there were
three or four members of the Dutch group, but would not release any names. A
Dutch television news report in February showed a member of the group at the
University of Utrecht reading information off a computer screen showing what
he said was missile test information taken electronically from a U.S. military
computer. His back was to the camera, and he was not named.;    Military and
intelligence agencies physically separate classified computer networks from
those used by businesses and researchers to protect the data from electronic
forays. When classified information is transmitted over unprotected computer
networks or telephone lines it must be specially coded.;    A Bay Area
computer expert with knowledge of classified systems said a large number of
unclassified computer programs that simulate the flight of missiles are
circulating on the Internet. The expert said the programs, many of them
decades old, are being updated by various programmers, and it is possible for
intruders on the Internet to easily discover them.;    But the expert, and
other computer security experts, say it is extremely unlikely the Dutch group
discovered any secret or highly sensitive military data in their break-ins.;  
 "Secret stuff isn't on the Internet," said Michael Odawa, a Mill Valley
programmer and computer security expert. "It's against the rules for anyone
with classified clearance to put that information on the Internet. If (the
Dutch group) found something secret, it's a gross exception to the rule.";   
No fear of punishment;  Because there are no computer crime laws in the
Netherlands, U.S. investigators said, members of the Dutch group boasted that
they could enter computers via international data networks with impunity.;   
But some of the intruders have been identified, and a federal official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there were numerous other criminal
offenses for which they could be prosecuted in both the United States and the
Netherlands. One possible charge might be telephone fraud.;    But legal
experts said that because there are no prohibitions against unauthorized
computer entry in the Netherlands successfully prosecuting the group may still
prove impossible.;    The case is significant, legal experts said, because
while the United States and many European countries have strict laws barring
illegal access to computers, there are many nations that have no computer
crime laws.;    Standardized law sought;  There is a proposed law before
parliament in the Netherlands that would make unauthorized computer access a
crime. Also, a governmental committee of the European Community is now working
to standardize computer crime laws in Europe.;    In the Netherlands case, the
group was detected last year after an unusually skilled U.S. government
computer researcher at a national laboratory tracked the group's every move.
He notified U.S. authorities of the break-ins.;    The researcher has been
able to make computer records of the intruders' keystrokes as they have
electronically prowled through U.S. military, NASA, university and dozens of
other computers. He then played this information back and gained an exact
picture of the computer screen as it appeared to the intruders in the
Netherlands.;    From 1986 to 1988 Clifford Stoll, an astronomer at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, traced a similar group of West Germans, who were
illegally entering U.S. computers and selling computer data and software to a
Soviet intelligence officer.;    Suspended sentences;  Stoll was able to
persuade law enforcement officials to locate the group in West Germany and
three arrests were made. A German court eventually convicted them, but gave
them suspended sentences.;    The tactics of the Dutch group are of particular
interest to computer security experts because they have repeatedly used
security loopholes demonstrated by a program written by Robert T. Morris, a
Cornell University student, more than two years ago.;    Last month a federal
appeals court upheld the conviction of Morris, who in 1988 unleashed a program
that jammed several thousand computers in a nationwide network. He was
convicted of violating federal computer crime statutes and was fined $10,000
and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service.;    That the same
security flaws can be used to illicitly enter computers several years after
they were widely publicized indicates that many computer managers are still
paying only minimal attention to data security, computer security researchers
said.  </TEXT>

   A computer hacker broke into a Defense Department computer network and browsed through data at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory last month, a lab official said. 

   The breach occurred on the night of May 16, when a single unidentified operator used a legitimate password to break into a computer-aided engineering system, according to Haskell G. O'Brien, a manager of NASA's communications and computing network services section. 
The laboratory system is part of a general information-trading computer network, and Mr. O'Brien said none of the network's members contain classified information. 

   The hacker may have gained access to a Navy computer as well, but laboratory officials said they knew little about that attempt. 
It appeared that no data were damaged or copied from the NASA system. 

   The intrusion was the third attempt in about two years at the NASA facility. 
One of the earlier attempts was successful, but that intruder was identified, Mr. O'Brien said.

APPROACHING ZERO: DATA CRIME AND THE COMPUTER UNDERWORLD by Bryan Clough and
Paul Mungo Faber Pounds 14.99, 242 pages
COMPUTER FRAUD is estimated to cost UK and US banks and companies more than
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) annually, yet 85 per cent of incidents are never
reported. Approaching Zero tracks the origins of computer 'hacking', from
its birth in the American sub-culture of the 1970s to a worldwide phenomenon
that recognises no national boundaries and, some believe, threatens the
high-tech foundations of modern society.
Written in a lively style by accountant and computer security expert Bryan
Clough and journalist Paul Mungo, the book explores the shadowy world of the
'programmers and technobrats' who use their skills and the telephone system
to circumvent computer access codes and passwords, sometimes just to leave
behind computer 'viruses' which can destroy data and can wreak havoc with
computer systems. The text is peppered with the colourful 'handles' or
aliases of hackers, many of which are straight out of the world of comic
books - men like Captain Crunch, widely acknowledged as the father of
hacking, Phiber Optik, and sinister gangs such as the Legion of Doom whose
members are committed to destroying computer system.
John Draper, alias Captain Crunch, once described hackers as the Silicon
Brotherhood. Membership of the Brotherhood is fluid - you are a member when
you know you are - and today probably comprises about 2,000 of the smartest,
most obsessive computer 'freaks' worldwide. In spite of sophisticated
security systems it seems that no computers are safe. As is well documented,
teenage hackers using cheap home computers have penetrated even the most
'secure' systems including those at NASA, NATO and the Pentagon.
The book provides an insight into what motivates these mostly young
high-tech outlaws. In some cases it is profit, sometimes it appears to be
the sheer excitement of digital vandalism, but more often than not the
hackers simply enjoy outwitting the computer security experts, usually
managing to stay just one step ahead of the law.
For some readers the narrative may appear too flippant. But there is a
serious underlying point to the book. Zero is when a computer system is
devoid of data, memory or function, and the authors suggest we are
'approaching zero' because the technology and means to wipe out computer
systems do indeed exist.

   To the associate who turned him in, Kevin
David Mitnick is a ``big, fat slob'' obsessed with fast food and
breaking into computer systems.
   To the authorities holding him without bail, the 25-year-old Los
Angeles man is an expert hacker who calls himself Condor and is so
dangerous he must never be allowed to use even a telephone without
supervision.
   ``He is truly a threat to society, someone who uses computers to
act out personal vendettas against people,'' said Jim Black, a
computer crime specialist with the Police Department.
   ``The bottom line with Kevin is that if you have a job, pay a gas
bill, use a phone or drive a car he can find you and ruin you
electronically,'' Black said in a telephone interview. ``If he
wasn't in jail, he could be listening to us right this minute.'
   Mitnick was being held today in a maximum-security cell at the
federal Metropolitan Detention Center.
   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraud
charges, accusing him of using unauthorized MCI long-distance codes
to tap into computers at Leeds University in England and the
University of Southern California and causing $4 million damage to a
Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Mitnick will plead innocent, said his attorney, Alan Rubin.
   ``We will also try to get bail set,'' Rubin said. ``I am shocked
and astonished that my client is being held without bail and in
solitary confinement. This thing has been blown completely out of
proportion.''
   Longtime associate Leonard DiCicco, 23, of Calabasas, said he
reported Mitnick's activities to authorities because Mitnick had
been threatening him.
   ``He was using DEC computers where I work and threatening that we
would both go down if I said anything,'' said DiCicco, who faces no
charges in the inquiry.
   ``He has no sense of right or wrong and no respect for anyone
else's privacy,'' DiCicco said. ``I was beside him through all this
hacking and it's scary to think of the things he is capable of.''
   ``He could pick apart almost any computer system in the United
States,'' Black said. ``There are probably only a handful of
computer specialists with his capabilities.''
   In his electronic activities, the 5-11, 240-pound Mitnick
referred to himself as Condor, Black said. DiCicco said Mitnick
named himself for Robert Redford's character's code name in the spy
movie ``Three Days of the Condor.''
   ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpees and work on
computers,'' DiCicco said. ``He was a big, fat slob of a guy who
couldn't get through a day without breaking into a computer
somewhere.''
   Mitnick began his hacking career using telephones, authorities
said. By age 13, he was under investigation by the police
department, Pacific Bell telephone company and the Federal
Communications Commission, the Los Angeles Daily News said Monday.
   ``Mitnick was a legend to the computer world by 1981,'' said John
Christ, his high school computer teacher.
   In 1982, DiCicco said, he and Mitnick used USC's 24-hour student
computer lab to get into many computers, including classified
systems.
   ``Our favorite was the National Security Agency computer because
it was supposed to be so confidential,'' DiCicco said. ``It was like
a big playground once you got into it.''

FT  26 FEB 93 / Computer hacker 'cost FT Pounds 24,871'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHOOLBOY who allegedly hacked into a Financial Times computer which
stored data on share price indices caused considerable disruption at the
newspaper, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Paul Bedworth, now a student at Edinburgh University, hacked into the
FT's computer to use its account with BT to reach other computing systems,
the jury was told.
Mr Anthony Johnson, former head of computing services for the FT, said the
hacking was noticed in May 1991. Systems engineers discovered a dialling
program had been inserted. It made one telephone call a second and increased
the FT's telephone bill by Pounds 705.
Part of the system had to be removed for investigations which took weeks.
Fresh equipment had to be rented while this work was carried out. The total
cost of the hacking was Pounds 24,871.
The security system had been designed so that only users with a password
could deliver information to the computer.
The hacker was able to use a 'back door' in the system to gain entry to the
computer without such a password, he said. The back doors had been put into
the system for the convenience of engineers, but were not removed before the
computer was issued.
Mr Johnson denied a suggestion from Mr Ian MacDonald QC, defending, that the
FT's computer was a 'hacker's dream'. Such back doors would not usually be
known to users of the system, he said.
Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire, denies three conspiracy charges
under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 alleging unauthorised modification of
computer information, securing unauthorised access to computer information
and obtaining telegraphic services unlawfully.
The trial continues today.

   Computer `Hacker'
   Robert Morris Gets
   3 Years Probation

   Robert T. Morris Jr., the computer "hacker" who unleashed
a virus that disrupted a nationwide electronic mail network
in 1988, was sentenced by a federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y.,
to three years probation and a $10,000 fine.
   Judge Howard Munson also ordered Mr. Morris, 25 years old,
to perform 400 hours of community service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Computer experts said the sentence was too light to serve
as much of a deterrent to similar crimes by hackers.
   In January, Mr. Morris was convicted of violating the
federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, under which he could
have been imprisoned for as long as five years and fined as
much as $250,000. The case has been closely watched in the
computer industry because of rising concern about breaches of
computer security.
   "I don't think people in this country are quite ready to
send someone to the slammer" for launching a computer virus,
said Belden Menkus, a computer-security consultant in
Hillsboro, Tenn. "If there had been a theft of funds, a jail
term would have been more likely." Added Clifford Stoll, a
Harvard University astronomer known as an authority on
computer breakins: "I'm not surprised {by the sentence}
because of the nature of what {Mr. Morris} did and the lack
of malice involved."
   During Mr. Morris's trial, his attorney argued that he was
guilty of a mistake rather than a crime. Mr. Morris's virus,
or "worm" program, was designed to spread quietly through
Internet, an electronic mail system used by academic,
corporate and government researchers. But because of a
programming error, Mr. Morris said in his testimony, it
careened out of control. The program sped through thousands
of computers nationwide and disrupted operations at many
computer centers linked by the network.
   Federal prosecutors argued that Mr. Morris was guilty of
more than an innocent prank, noting that he stole computer
passwords and designed his program to be difficult to
eradicate from computers.
   Among computer professionals, "the consensus was that {Mr.
Morris} should have gotten at least a modest amount of jail
time as a deterrent," said Jack Bologna, editor of Computers
and Security magazine in Plymouth, Mich. "Even 90 days would
have been better than nothing at all."
   Mr. Morris plans to appeal his conviction in an attempt to
erase the felony from his record, said Thomas Guidoboni, his
attorney, at a news conference. He added that Mr. Morris
already has had offers from computer-service providers
willing to put him to work to discharge his community-service
requirement. One offer came from a state agency in West
Virginia that wants Mr. Morris to work on computer programs
that help in collecting child-support payments, Mr. Guidoboni
added.

COMPUTER ACE INDICTED IN TAPPING OF U.S. NETWORK

A computer hacker who once gained fame by breaking into the UCLA computer 
system has been indicted on charges of invading a classified military computer, 
stealing the unlisted telephone numbers of the Soviet Consulate in San 
Francisco, and routinely breaching Pacific Bell's security. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also alleges that in January, 1988, Kevin L. Poulsen, 24, then a 
computer expert at SRI International in the Silicon Valley, stole a printout of 
the unlisted phone numbers of Ferdinand E. Marcos and several cronies. The FBI 
was using the numbers in its investigation of the late Philippine president, 
who then was living in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensitive nature of the information Poulsen allegedly obtained, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Crowe of San Jose said Thursday that "it is not an 
espionage case." 
</P>
<P>
Poulsen is still at large. Prosecutors believe that he is hiding in the Los 
Angeles area. He called authorities earlier this week, but used his skill with 
telephones to evade a phone trace, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
His two co-defendants have turned themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment does not charge that Poulsen sold the material he obtained, such 
as the Soviet Consultate telephone numbers. Instead, he is accused of 
possessing what he took -- computer access codes, telephone credit cards 
numbers, and, more significantly, plans relating to a 1988 Army exercise out of 
Ft. Bragg, N.C. The plan was classified as "secret" when he stole it, but since 
has been declassified. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Poulsen gained access to the classified Army MASNET 
computer network. But the indictment does not specify how he gained such access 
or how he obtained the Soviet Consulate numbers from the phone company. 
</P>
<P>
Poulsen also is charged with tapping the phone conversations of a North 
Hollywood family, apparently because he was infatuated with the daughter. The 
FBI discovered Poulsen's tapes of the family's phone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin is a very lonely and sad person. He felt powerless in his life and doing 
this was a way for him to have power," Annette Randol, mother of Sean Randol, 
the young North Hollywood woman who had caught Poulsen's fancy, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Randol said Poulsen dropped by the Randol home in 1984, boasting that 
the prestigious SRI of Menlo Park offered him a job after seeing articles about 
his hacking exploits. At the age of 17 in 1983, Poulsen made headlines when Los 
Angeles law enforcement authorities investigated him and a friend for what was 
one of the earliest known computer break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
He had used a Radio Shack laptop computer to gain wide-ranging access to a 
university research network. Although Poulsen acknowledged his activities, he 
said at the time that he did not realize he was doing something wrong. He was 
never charged, but his friend was sentenced to three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who hired him did know he had some hacker experience in his 
background, but he was a very bright guy," said Donn Parker, security expert 
with SRI. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in the indictment unsealed on Wednesday were Mark K. Lottor, 25, 
of Menlo Park, and Robert E. Gilligan, 31, of San Francisco, also past or 
present SRI computer employees. 
</P>
<P>
Poulsen faces up to 37 years in prison. Lottor and Gilligan could be sentenced 
to up to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment says Poulsen and his roommate, Lottor, carried out their 
activities from their Menlo Park apartment living room, which they dubbed "the 
Switching Room" and had equipped with computers and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also accuses Poulsen of using Pacific Bell identification badges 
to gain access to its facilities, and then stealing various items. 
Additionally, Poulsen allegedly intercepted phone calls placed by Pacific Bell 
itself -- as part of an effort to obstruct the company's investigation of him.

<HEAD>Three Computer Hackers Plead Guilty to BellSouth Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of an underground group of computer
hackers that bilked telecommunications companies of money and
credit information pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges
Monday.
   The three are members of the ``Legion of Doom,'' a closely knit
group of about 15 computer hackers operating in Georgia, Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Florida, New York and other states, said U.S.
Attorney Joe Whitley.
   Whitley said the group disrupted telecommunications, stole
computer source codes and information, stole credit information and
fraudulently obtained money and property.
   In May, authorities in Indiana who prosecuted a teen-ager
involved with the group called it an elite group of hackers that
accepted only the nation's best computer moles.
   The juvenile, who was not identified, pleaded guilty to 11
counts of fraud and agreed to testify against the Atlanta men in a
trial scheduled to begin Monday.
   Instead, the three pleaded guilty. They were identified as Adam
E. Grant, 22, and Robert J. Riggs, 22, both of Atlanta, and
Franklin E. Darden Jr., 24, of Norcross.
   Federal authorities charged that between Sept. 10, 1987, and
July 21, 1989, the three men illegally accessed various BellSouth
Co. computer systems and obtained valuable information that they
distributed to other hackers.
   Grant and Darden also monitored private telephone conversations,
Whitley said in a statement.
   They were charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, wire
fraud, access code fraud and interstate transportation of stolen
property.
   Darden and Riggs pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy each
and face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more BellSouth access
devices with intent to defraud and faces a possible 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A spokesman for BellSouth, Scott Ticer, said the operation cost
his company about $1.5 million, most of it for investigating and
changing access codes.

   A federal judge says she will order a computer
hacker to spend a year in a rehabilitation center to treat what was
called his addiction to computer tampering.
   Kevin Mitnick, who authorities had described as too dangerous to
be allowed near a telephone alone for fear he might access
computers, will be placed in the custody of Gateways Hospital's
rehabilitation program, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer said
Monday.
   The judge said she will decide today whether Mitnick should also
be sentenced to prison. He was scheduled to be sentenced this
afternoon.
   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in March to computer fraud and
possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes.
   He previously was convicted of using unauthorized MCI long
distance codes to tap into computers at Leeds University in England
and the University of Southern California, and of causing million of
dollars in damage to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Both Harriet Rossetto, the rehabilitation program's director, and
Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said Mitnick's case was
the first they had heard of in which a person charged with computer
hacking had been treated as an addict.
   Ms. Rossetto testified that Mitnick has an ``impulse disorder,''
and would benefit from treatment. She said his illegal computer
activity gives him a sense of self-esteem he is otherwise lacking.
   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was no
greed involved. There was no sabotage involved.'
   ``It's something like climbing Mt. Everest,'' Asperger said. ``He
did it because it's there.''

<TEXT>
   A computer hacker characterized as a program
pirate obsessed with cracking secret access codes was sentenced
Tuesday to a year in federal prison and six months rehabilitation.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer issued the prison sentence
after learning she could not place Kevin Mitnick in a
hospital-operated therapy program for what an expert witness called
Mitnick's ``impulse disorder.''
   The program is not under contract with the federal government,
said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney.
   ``A federal sentence has to be served in a federal facility,''
she said.
   Mitnick, who has been incarcerated at the federal Metropolitan
Detention Center downtown for seven months, need only serve five
more months in prison, Ms. Denton said.
   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in May to computer fraud and
possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes. He will spend
six months in a residential therapy program after serving his prison
term.
   The charges stemmed from his use of stolen MCI long-distance
codes to tap into computers and copy valuable programs from Digital
Equipment Corp.
   After his prison term, Mitnick will be under conditional release
for three years. Mitnick will not be able to possess any illegal or
unauthorized access to computers or telecommunications equipment,
and will not be allowed to associate with known hackers. Another
condition states that he must complete a rehabilitation program.
   During his six months in a halfway house, Mitnick will be allowed
to either go to work or to treatment programs during the day, but he
must return to the halfway house at night, Ms. Denton said. He can
still have a personal computer.
   At one time, federal authorities considered Mitnick dangerous
enough to restrict his telephone use in jail. But Mitnick later
cooperated with authorities and apologized in court for his actions,
promising never to repeat them.
   Harriet Rossetto, a licensed social worker, testified that
Mitnick suffers from an impulse disorder and that his illegal
computer activity boosted his self-esteem.
   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was no
greed involved. There was no sabotage involved.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said that Mitnick's
activities were ``something like climbing Mount Everest.''
   ``He did it because it's there,'' said Asperger.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker broke into the 911 emergency
telephone network covering nine states in the South and another
intruder passed on the access data to other hackers, authorities
said.
   Robert J. ``The Prophet'' Riggs, 20, of Decatur, Ga., and Craig
M. ``Knight Lightning'' Neidorf, 19, of Chesterfield, Mo., were
indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury and accused of computer
crimes, said acting U.S. Attorney Ira H. Raphaelson.
   He said Riggs was a member of the so-called Legion of Doom
hackers group, whose members are involved in numerous illegal
activities.
   Riggs and two other alleged members also were indicted Tuesday
in Atlanta and charged in other computer break-ins.
   The government would not say if any emergency calls were
disrupted or whether other damage was done during the tampering.
   ``These were not teen-agers playing games,'' Raphaelson said.
``They are thieves, they're reckless and they're dangerous.''
   In the Chicago case, Riggs is accused of entering Atlanta-based
Bell South's 911 system with a computer, stealing a copy of the
program that controls the system and publishing this data on a
hackers' computer bulletin board in Lockport.
   Neidorf is accused of transferring the data to his computer at
the University of Missouri in Columbia, where he allegedly edited
it for a computer hacker publication known as PHRACK.
   There was no immediate comment from either defendant. Directory
information had no listing for Riggs, and there was a recorded
message at the Neidorf residence. Neidorf's attorney, Art Margulis,
said he had not seen the indictment so he could not comment.
   Raphaelson said industry specialists estimate that $3 billion to
$5 billion is lost yearly to computer fraud. He said this is the
fourth hacker case brought by the federal government in the past
year.
   Bell South's 911 controls emergency calls to municipal police,
fire, ambulance and emergency services in Alabama, Mississippi,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Florida.
   ``People who invade our telecommunications and related computer
systems for profit or personal amusement create immediate and
serious consequences for the public at large,'' said Raphaelson.
   He said the 911 data was valued at nearly $80,000, but would not
say how a hacker could profit by stealing this data, other than by
selling the information to others.
   Riggs, if convicted on all charges, could be sentenced to 32
years in prison and fined $222,000. Neidorf could be sentenced to
31 years and fined $122,000 on conviction.
   Riggs and Neidorf are charged with interstate transportation of
stolen property, wire fraud and violations of the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act of 1986.

<TEXT>
   A computer hacker has breached
lower-level security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for
the 11th time in a week, officials said.
   The latest intrusion into the system took place Saturday, the lab
announced Monday.
   So far, the hacker has managed to invade the unclassified
research computer systems at the lab at least 11 times during the
past week.
   There have been no new intrusions since the weekend, Chuck Cole,
chief of the nuclear weapons facility, said through a spokesman.
   The spokesman, Ronald Teunis, said Cole could not comment
directly because he was ``exhausted'' from the hectic weeklong
invasion of the computer systems by the mysterious hacker.
   Cole had issued a public invitation to the hacker or hackers last
Saturday, asking to be contacted directly ``so I can see what he
wants.''
   Teunis said Cole has received several telephone calls from people
offering to help, but none was believed to be the hacker.
   He said the system involved is the UNIX network, which links
research labs and universities around the nation. The network, used
for unclassified scientific research, was the one invaded last month
by a computer virus believed released by a Cornell University
graduate student.
   The Livermore hacker has not invaded the lab's highly secret
nuclear weapons research computers, which are physically and
electronically separated from the unclassified system.
   Teunis said the hacker has not destroyed or altered any
information in the files, although the hacker apparently has the
capability of doing so.
   Cole emphasized earlier that the attacks do not involve a virus,
a program that invades a computer system and can clog its memory
system by overreproduction.

one count of conspiring to commit computer fraud. Both face a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Mr. Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more devices
that provided access to BellSouth computers with intent to
commit fraud. He faces up to 10 years in prison as well as a
$250,000 fine.
   Neither Mr. Riggs nor Mr. Grant could be reached for
comment. Mr. Darden said he had agreed to cooperate with
BellSouth in helping to secure the company's computer
systems. Acknowledging that he was "more or less a hacker,"
Mr. Darden said his actions were simply a hobby at first. "I
hope anybody that's hacking out there now hears this and
stops," he added. Sentencing for all three men is set for
Sept. 14.
   A hacker is a person who attempts to gain unauthorized
access to computer files in various systems.
   The U.S. attorney in Atlanta, Joe Whitley, said yesterday
that the three individuals belonged to the so-called Legion
of Doom, a cadre of 15 computer hackers in Georgia, Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Florida, New York and other states.
   Mr. Whitley said the group disrupted the
telecommunications industry, monitored private telephone
lines, stole proprietary information, stole and modified
credit information, fraudulently obtained property from
various companies, and disseminated information that allowed
other computer hackers to enter BellSouth and other computer
systems.

<HEAD>East German Ex-Spy Chief Says KGB May Be New Boss for Some</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Markus Wolf, East Germany's
celebrated former spy chief, was quoted Friday as saying some former
agents may now be working for the Soviet KGB.
   However, Wolf said he thought any such defections were individual
cases, rather than the result of wholesale recruitment, according to
an interview in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich.
   Wolf called for a meeting of officials from both Germanys to try
to resolve the problem of inner-German espionage. He predicted the
longer it takes to resolve how a united Germany deals with former
Communist spies, the greater the danger even more East German agents
will defect to other spy networks.
   Wolf, 67, recently returned to East Berlin from Moscow, where he
said he went to finish work on a book. West German counter-espionage
officials alleged he was meeting with the KGB to turn over East
Germany's spy network in West Germany.
   Wolf retired in 1987 as head of foreign intelligence in Communist
East Germany's Security Ministry, where he gained a reputation as
one of the most skilled intelligence chiefs in the East bloc.
   West Germany has an arrest warrant out for him for his espionage
activities, but Wolf is protected as long as the two Germansy remain
separate countries. West German officials have not yet decided how
they will handle East German spies after unification.
   The Munich Abendzeitung newspaper on Friday quoted Guenther
Beckstein, a senior official in the Bavarian Interior Ministry, as
saying East Germany should hand Wolf over to West Germany for
prosecution.
   Beckstein likened Wolf's case to that of suspected terrorist
Susanne Albrecht, who was captured by East German authorities in
East Berlin on Wednesday and is expected to be turned over to West
Germany next week.
   In Bonn, spokesman Roland Bachmeier of the West German Interior
Ministry said a meeting of the two German interior ministers in
April provided the information that led to Albrecht's capture. West
German authorities had sought Ms. Albrecht, a suspected member of
the leftist Red Army faction, for 13 years.
   The Red Army faction has been blamed for a wave of terror in West
Germany since the early 1970s.
