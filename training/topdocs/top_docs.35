COVER STORY: THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN: CNN TURNS 10;

"WE HAVE TO REACH FOR THE STARS AND WHEN WE GET THERE, FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND
THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN CARRY IT LIVE." -- CISSY BAKER, CNN VICE PRESIDENT AND
MANAGING EDITOR

<P>
Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were
stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather
reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts,
somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news.
</P>
<P>
A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around
the world.
</P>
<P>
When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10
years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the
announcement came from a man whose WTB' "superstation" in Atlanta used to
fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who
once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle.
Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three
networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here
anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal."
</P>
<P>
CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National
Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was
located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played
"You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out.
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan administration and the three
networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's
paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50
million. Its broadcasts would reach-indeed span-the globe to about 90
countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would
become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match.
</P>
<P>
The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, president, CNN
</P>
<P>
"I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when TBS first went up on
satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since they had the new
movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on TBS, I thought the
next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news channel. That's
where I got the idea. . . Even though I did not have the money and did not know
anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept was good
enough to go ahead and give it a shot.
</P>
<P>
"The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say
that I minded in retrospect."
</P>
<P>
Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new contract I was being offered at ABC
as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was tired of the network pool I had
been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone Arledge spent an hour in his
office warning me it would be very bad for my career to go do something called
CNN. When I left, most people weren't even trying to conceal their derision,
their snickers. My attitude when I walked into CNN was the same attitude I had
at Marine Corps boot camp the first day. "I'm here. Let's get on with it."
</P>
<P>
"The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's
speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we
were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, "They're
shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio, and you could hear agents
running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't
get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our
coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something.
I wasn't making as much money as Dan, Peter or Tom-I still don't-but I knew I
was in the right place."
</P>
<P>
Ed Turner, executive vice president of news gathering
</P>
<P>
"We started out in half terror and half confidence. We all ran scared. Hell, we
still do. The conventional wisdom was that CNN was not going to make it. They
told us, 'First, there's no way you guys are going to get on the air. Second,
if you get on the air, there's no way you're going to stay there. Third, if by
some remote chance you do stay on the air, you'll bankrupt Ted (Turner).' Other
than that, it was a lot of encouragement."
</P>
<P>
Lou Dobbs, vice president of business news
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect competitively. My principal concern was not that
we couldn't pull it off. But I wanted to know would CBS emulate? Would ABC
duplicate? That was my fear. I knew that after we were on the air for six
months, we would be very vulnerable to the networks. Starting a 24-hour news
network required an investment by Ted Turner that could have bankrupted him,
but to the networks that kind of money is pocket change. The fact that a
successful imitator hasn't arisen astounds me to this day. The networks'
failure to react to the competitive threat of CNN was the answer to my
prayers."
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked into the Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at
a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland MGM musical. They were still building the bureau
about three weeks before air time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was
testing a microphone. Producers were literally hammering the sign of the bureau
into place. And Daniel Schorr was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS
was like after World War II.' As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship
was leaving, and I knew I had to be on it or get left behind.
</P>
<P>
"Ted (Turner's) master stroke was to install a satellite dish and put CNN in
the offices of Congress. The powerful people in the country turned to CNN the
day shots were fired at Reagan to find out what was happening. Bernie (Shaw)
was the hero of that one. He was the only network anchor not to declare Jim
Brady dead, which was extraordinary given the pressure to do so. The three
established networks had declared him dead, and Dan Rather held a moment of
silence for him. That's when I knew we were on our way."
</P>
<P>
Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst, National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
(Schorr was a CBS News correspondent before being hired as CNN's first
employee. He left in 1985 over a dispute for editorial independence.)
</P>
<P>
"Ted Turner approached me a year before he started CNN. He asked me to join him
at the cable convention in Las Vegas, and then hired me 15 minutes before the
press conference to give legitimacy to what he was going to propose. I didn't
know anything about cable. But as he outlined CNN to me, I saw the vision
there, something inherently viable, a way to give people news 24 hours a day so
that they could turn it on and off like a water tap. I liked the idea of live
coverage as opposed to capsule coverage. I don't know where he got his
conceptions from, because I could tell he didn't know anything about news.
</P>
<P>
"I knew CNN would be a success. What I didn't anticipate was the extent of
CNN's success today. It would have been like asking me to foresee a revolution
in Eastern Europe, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I didn't foresee that
CNN would be seen in hotel rooms around the world. That CNN would be the pearl
in Ted's crown."
</P>
<P>
Cissy Baker, vice president and managing editor
</P>
<P>
"I thought CNN would be successful. I always believed it would be. It was
everybody else I had to convince. That became a second full-time job, really. I
wish I had a tape recorder in the beginning, when I was running the Washington
desk, trying to get an interview with a congressman or official. I would say,
'Hi, this is Cissy Baker. I'm calling from CNN, Cable News Network, Ted
Turner's all-news, 24-hour network, based in Atlanta, Ga., with a bureau here
in Washington. Do you get cable? Let me tell you about cable.' And then after a
while, I would get this, 'I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?' "
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today."
</P>
<P>
(Williams left for NBC last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman.)
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to us we couldn't make this thing appen. In January of 1981,
when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all along
the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to cut
between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing cold
with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this? We
have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some
wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched.
Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
"That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were
manipulating wires by hand.
</P>
<P>
"In the industry, CNN was a quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing
quiet about it. On June 1, 1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time.
Our lead story was live. Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President
Carter walking out of the hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m.
Eastern time, the broadcast networks went on with their evening newscasts, and
their lead story was Carter walking out of the hospital, and the footage said
'Courtesy of CNN' in the corner. That was our first night on the air."

late-night news programming.
</P>
<P>

   Cable News Network today said it is considering an
evening newscast to compete directly with the big three TV networks.
   The idea under consideration calls for a newscast at 6 p.m. or
6:30 p.m. EDT ``to go head-to-head with the networks,'' and CNN
anchorman Bernard Shaw could have a role on the program, CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But he said CNN officials haven't made a final determination of
whether a frontal assault on Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan
Rather would be a good idea.
   ``There are a number of changes we're talking about, and that's
one of the changes,'' he said.
   The proposal calls for a half-hour, stand-alone newscast, unlike
CNN's virtually 24-hour, all-news format, in which the news is
continuously updated.
   CNN currently runs news in the 6-6:30 period and shows the
entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30 p.m., when
NBC, ABC and CBS air the first of their evening news feeds, or
transmissions to affiliate stations. The networks also produce an
updated feed at 7 p.m.
   Haworth said speculation that Catherine Crier would be co-anchor
of the program was premature. The Texas judge was hired Monday as a
newscaster.
   ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When she comes
up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll start figuring
what anchor role she'll be playing with us,'' he said.

   Cable News Network, which went after the big three
TV networks in 1980 with round-the-clock news, is preparing a
frontal assault with an hour-long newscast premiering next month.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth announced Tuesday the newscast will
be shown from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, possibly with CNN anchor Bernard
Shaw. But Haworth said, ``We have no decision on talent yet.''
   The program would be twice the length of the evening news on NBC,
ABC and CBS.
   CNN's newscasts are carried live in each time zone, meaning the
program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast. The new show
will begin Oct., 16, he said.
   Haworth said the new program would be designed to ``go
head-to-head with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour of
news at 6:30 p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.
   ``Seventy percent of the people who watch the evening news watch
the 6:30 p.m. segment,'' Haworth said.
   CNN now runs its continuous news format in the 6-6:30 time period
and shows the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30
p.m. EDT.
   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine
Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchor
the new evening news program was premature.
   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joins
us,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When
she comes up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll start
figuring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''
   CNN started in June 1980. It has sports, commentary, talk and
specialty shows, but the bulk of its 24-hour schedule is news.

   The ratings still begin with a decimal point, but
Cable News Network is standing by its fledgling dinner-time
newscast, ``The World Today.''
   CNN launched the one-hour program in October, starting it at 6
p.m. EST, a time slot in which its second half-hour competes
directly with the nightly newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC in the
Eastern and Central time zones, where 75 percent of the nation's
viewers live.
   CNN's new show gained some immediate attention with the
selection of Catherine Crier, up until last year a Texas judge, to
join veteran newsman Bernard Shaw at the anchor desk _ Crier in
Atlanta, Shaw in Washington.
   The ratings show they aren't yet in the same league with ABC's
Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather. Far from it.
   Last week's Nielsens showed ABC's ``World News Tonight'' winning
its eighth consecutive victory with an 11.3 ratings average,
followed by the ``NBC Nightly News'' with a 10.1 average and the
``CBS Evening News'' with a 9.9.
   CNN says its ratings are averaging a .7, but the gap is even
bigger than it looks. In broadcasting, one rating point equals
921,000 homes. In cable, one point for CNN equals 547,820 homes,
the number CNN estimates it serves.
   But CNN says ratings for ``The World Today'' are growing every
month, and already are 16 percent better than the two programs
previously in the same time period.
   ``We're going to move ahead and stick to our game plan,'' said
Paul Amos, CNN's executive vice president of news programming.
``We're not going to abandon this in the short term. This is a very
long-term-oriented project.''
   Amos said the program has proved ``to be the right move ...
because we've managed to take a time period that was relatively
stagnant and improve on it.''
   Among other things, the program will be served _ although not
exclusively _by the new CNN investigative unit headed by Pamela
Hill, who for years was in charge of ABC News' now-defunct
``Closeup'' documentary unit.
   Hill's team, whose reports will start airing this month on CNN
broadcasts, includes former NBC political correspondent Ken Bode,
who signed on Friday as a contributing correspondent.
   Bode, who left NBC News last year to teach, will continue his
other job as a college professor, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   Bode is a print and broadcast news veteran. But not Crier. CNN
took perhaps one of its biggest chances when it hired her for ``The
World Today.''
   Her journalistic debut coincided with the program's, but Crier,
35, a civil judge for five years, said the parallels are
``tremendous'' between her old profession and her new one.
   As a trial lawyer, she said, she gathered facts by interviewing
witnesses and then delivered those facts clearly to a judge or
jury. As a judge, she said, she had to glean facts from piles of
evidence and draw objective conclusions.
   But while a judge might take weeks to weigh a case's evidence
before ruling, Crier said, TV reporting requires an enormous amount
of spontaneity because of its immediacy.
   Amos acknowledged that some at CNN were concerned about Crier's
inexperience.
   ``She was an unknown commodity,'' he said. ``And once she
started working at a computer terminal, Catherine Crier became
another staffer, and the rest of our journalists came to know her
and have warmed up to her.''
   CNN plans to publicize ``The World Today'' this spring with a
major advertising campaign.
   Many viewers have watched their evening news on the same network
for a generation, Amos said, adding, ``a 25-year-old ingrained
habit _ ... that's a tough habit to break.''
   ``It's going to take a long time to make the public aware that
we are here,'' he said. ``Less than 60 percent of the nation's
households have cable or access to the program.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television ...
   RATHER EXAMINES BURNOUT: Thursday's ``48 Hours,'' anchored by
Dan Rather, will examine the human cost of too fast a pace in life
and business in America. Among other things, the CBS show will
report on a California entrepreneur who CBS says ``has turned his
car into the office of the future _ and his life into a
round-the-clock rush hour.''

COVER STORY: THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN: CNN TURNS 10
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone

<P>
Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were
stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather
reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts,
somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news.
</P>
<P>
A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around
the world.
</P>
<P>
When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10
years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the
announcement came from a man whose TBS "superstation" in Atlanta used to
fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who
once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle.
Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three
networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here
anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal."
</P>
<P>
CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National
Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was
located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played
"You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out.
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan Administration and the three
networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's
paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50
million. Its broadcasts would reach -- indeed span -- the globe to about 90
countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would
become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match.
</P>
<P>
The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, president, CNN: "I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when
TBS first went up on satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since
they had the new movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on
TBS, I thought the next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news
channel. That's where I got the idea. Even though I did not have the money and
did not know anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept
was good enough to go ahead and give it a shot.
</P>
<P>
"The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say
that I minded in retrospect."
</P>
<P>
Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor: "In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new
contract I was being offered at ABC as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was
tired of the network pool I had been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone
Arledge spent an hour in his office warning me it would be very bad for my
career to go do something called CNN. When I left, most people weren't even
trying to conceal their derision, their snickers. My attitude when I walked
into CNN was the same attitude I had at Marine Corps boot camp the first day.
'I'm here. Let's get on with it.'
</P>
<P>
"The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's
speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we
were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, 'They're
shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio and you could hear agents
running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't
get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our
coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something.
I wasn't making as much money as Dan (Rather), Peter (Jennings) or Tom (Brokaw)
-- I still don't -- but I knew I was in the right place."
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today" (Williams left for NBC
last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman): "In the industry, CNN was a
quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing quiet about it. On June 1,
1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time. Our lead story was live.
Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President Carter walking out of the
hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m., Eastern time, the broadcast
networks went on with their evening newscasts, and their lead story was Carter
walking out of the hospital, and the footage said 'Courtesy of CNN' in the
corner. That was our first night on the air.
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to us that we couldn't make this thing happen. In January of
1981, when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all
along the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to
cut between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing
cold with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this?
We have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some
wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched.
Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
"That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were
manipulating wires by hand. We had one small minicam van, and we had to use a
topographical map and drive to the highest point of land in the area just so we
could get our broadcast out. I knew then that our can-do attitude could
overcome anything."
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent: "When I first walked into the
Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland
MGM musical. They were still building the bureau about three weeks before air
time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was testing a microphone. Producers
were literally hammering the sign of the bureau into place. And Daniel Schorr
was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS was like after World War II.'
As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship was leaving, and I knew I had
to be on it or get left behind."

<HL> CNN Plans Evening Newscast to Run Against Networks

   Cable News Network, the 24-hour all-news cable network, is preparing to launch an evening newscast next month, the first time it has scheduled a news program in competition with the three broadcast networks, according to people at CNN.

   And in an unorthodox move, the Turner Broadcasting System Inc. unit said it hired Catherine Crier, a state district judge from Dallas with no television or journalistic experience, to be a correspondent and anchor.
Although CNN didn't specify which program she would be assigned to, the CNN sources said she may co-anchor the new broadcast.

   CNN, which is expected to undergo some top management changes shortly, declined to comment on the new nightly news program.
But the CNN sources, who requested anonymity, said the newscast will be one hour long and has the working title "The World Today."
They said it is scheduled to premiere Oct. 16 at 6 p.m. EDT. Bernard Shaw, an anchor on CNN news programs, will be co-anchor, the sources said.

   CNN currently airs an entertainment news show, "Show Biz Today," at 6:30 p.m. when the three networks broadcast the first "feed" of their newscasts.
Each network said that a majority of their affiliates air the broadcasts at 6:30 p.m., instead of 7 p.m., when there is an updated second "feed."

   In the new tentative lineup, CNN would move its entertainment show to 5:30 p.m. and have a half-hour newscast, "Newswatch." at 5 p.m. CNN declined to comment on plans for "The World Today."

   A nightly news program that competes with the three broadcast networks is a departure from CNN's original strategy.
Turner officials said when the cable news channel made its debut in June 1980 that CNN didn't need a traditional evening newscast because it airs news around the clock.
The network started out in only 1.7 million households; today it is available in more than 51 million cable homes.
"We're equal in stature now to the networks, and we ought to go where the news viewing public is," said one CNN official.

   Bill Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw," said: "I'm intrigued by a one-hour newscast.
And as you have more competition, there is always the risk that some of your viewers may leave you.
But I want to wait to see what they do."
National Broadcasting Co. is a unit of General Electric Co.

   NBC is investing in news programming on cable through its new Consumer News and Business Channel, which it owns jointly with Cablevision Systems Corp.

   CNN's ratings are far lower than the networks'.
According to figures compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co., CNN has an average rating of 0.8.
In comparision, "ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings" last week had a 9.1 rating.
A ratings point represents 904,000 television households.

   CBS Inc. news officials declined to comment; officials of the ABC news unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. couldn't be reached for comment.

   CNN's latest moves come at a time when Turner Chairman R.E. "Ted" Turner is considering who will succeed 68-year-old Burt Reinhardt, who has served as president of CNN since 1982.
Mr. Reinhardt is said to have signed a three-year contract with Turner Broadcasting earlier this year with the understanding that a search for a successor would begin soon.

   Among the people being considered are Paul Amos, executive vice president for programming; Lou Dobbs, vice president and managing editor of CNN Business News; Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News; and Ed Turner (no relation to Ted Turner), executive vice president for news gathering.

   Meanwhile, CNN officials defended their decision to hire Ms. Crier.
"As a judge, trial lawyer and district attorney, Judge Crier has amply demonstrated the kind of critical thinking, knowledge and ability to express herself that are the very core of great journalism," said Mr. Reinhardt in a statement.
"We've never hired a judge before, and I don't know if any other TV news organization has either, but Judge Crier is a natural and is going to be a great news anchor for CNN."

   Ms. Crier, 34, was the youngest woman to be elected to the bench in Texas history in 1984, and was re-elected in 1988.
The Dallas judge resigned her elective post effective Sept. 30.

   "I've always done a lot of speeches," she said in an interview from her Dallas office, "and the agent who books my appearances recently began talking to me about pursuing this as a career.
I told him I was very interested and he brought my tape to CNN."

<P>
Call it the CNN paradox: At the hour of day when most TV viewers watch a
network news broadcast, the one network devoted solely to news has had no
newscast.
</P>
<P>
Now, as it approaches its 10th anniversary, CNN finally has a "flagship"
broadcast of its own. Starting tonight, CNN will broadcast "The World Today"
from 6 to 7 p.m. EDT weeknights and for the first time compete directly with
the nightly news seen on ABC, CBS and NBC (except on the West Coast, where "The
World Today" will be seen from 3 to 4 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
Until now, CNN's strategy has been to counter network news programming by
offering viewers something different -- most recently a show-business report
and financial news -- to compete in the East and Midwest against ABC's "World
News Tonight" with Peter Jennings, "The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather" and
"NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw. But with 70% of network news viewers
catching the 6:30 p.m. Eastern broadcasts, it occurred to CNN executives that
their channel was missing an opportunity to attract people who were accustomed
to hard news at that hour.
</P>
<P>
"This is when people go shopping for their news," said Paul Amos, executive
vice president of news programming for CNN, "and we need to be on the shelf."
</P>
<P>
With its entry into the nightly news war, where star power is deemed a key
factor, CNN has teamed its most visible newscaster, veteran Bernard Shaw, who
will anchor from Washington, with newcomer Catherine Crier, who is as fresh a
face as there is in broadcast journalism -- she's never worked in TV news
before. Before landing at the anchor desk in CNN's Atlanta headquarters, based
on her audition for a proposed CNN talk show, Crier was an assistant district
attorney and then a state district court judge in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
For years, the three broadcast networks have talked about expanding their
half-hour evening newscasts, in part to ease time limitations on reporting as
well as to add a new dimension to a format that has remained virtually
unchanged for more than 20 years. But they've been blocked by their affiliated
stations, which don't want to relinquish even 15 minutes of what is their most
lucrative local programming time.
</P>
<P>
Now CNN has beaten them to it, creating considerable interest in "The World
Today" among TV journalists.
</P>
<P>
"It's another competitor," says William Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC
Nightly News." "And we are all curious about how they are going to do it,
because this would really be the first evening 'news hour.' All of us have
thoughts on how we would do an hour."
</P>
<P>
(He and other TV newsmen don't regard PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" the
same way because, although it too is an hourlong nightly news show, it is
noncommercial and uses a different format from the traditional network
newscasts.)
</P>
<P>
"The World Today," as planned, will be divided into two half hours, the first
consisting of interviews and in-depth treatment of news and issues; some
reports might last up to 20 minutes, heretofore virtually unheard of in a
nightly newscast. The hour's second half will come closer to the traditional
nightly news format by presenting an overview of the day's important events.
</P>
<P>
Bill Kaczaraba, executive producer of "The World Today," described the program
as "a little more sophisticated" than CNN's usual broadcasts, which tend toward
straightforward, unadorned delivery of the news with stories repeated and
updated frequently. "The World Today" will have its own set and present a
package of freshly produced reports, which will be updated on subsequent
broadcasts, most notably "PrimeNews" (5 p.m. PDT) and "CNN Evening News" (7
p.m. PST).
</P>
<P>
CNN's decision to go head-to-head with the network newscasts is, by all
accounts, necessary for the network's growth as an influential news
organization.
</P>
<P>
"To truly come into their own, they do need a kind of signature broadcast,"
said Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Study at
Columbia University. The new broadcast, he said, is "a sign of maturation" for
CNN, which went on the air in June, 1980, as Ted Turner's upstart in the TV
news business. Today, CNN, which reaches 51 million cable subscribers, is
regarded as an equal alongside the three network news divisions.
</P>
<P>
"The World Today" isn't expected to have an immediate effect on the network
newscasts, each of which, despite a slight decline in audience during the last
few years, still attract an average of 8.5 million households nightly. In
contrast, about 500,000 households have been tuning in for CNN's early
"Newswatch" broadcast and the half-hour "Showbiz Today," which will move to
2:30 p.m. PDT starting today. "Moneyline" will continue to air at 4 p.m. PDT,
following "The World Today."
</P>
<P>
Even CNN executives say wooing viewers from the long-established network
newscasts will be a gradual process, because viewing habits are hard to break.
"We do not expect a tidal wave coming out of the blocks," says CNN's Amos. "One
thing we are cognizant of is that news programming takes a long time to build
an audience."

   Weary network crews trudged home today after
following their anchormen from Czechoslovakia to Rome to Malta,
where they covered a summit whose storms threatened to upstage the
superpowers.
   At one point Saturday night, CBS anchor Dan Rather warned that
``if the weather doesn't improve, this thing's going to be a
wreck.''
   But from the TV standpoint, the only thing wrecked at the summit
was a small studio CNN had built near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking
the harbor site of the shipboard meetings of President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   A CNN spokesman said the structure was demolished by Saturday's
storm, which forced the cancellation of the day's second planned
meeting of the two leaders and sent network staffs scurrying to
reshape their coverage.
   CNN anchor Bernard Shaw had to remain with the other anchors in
the city of Valetta, six miles away. But that was only one of CNN's
problems.
   Saturday's 60 mph winds blew down and damaged a CNN satellite
dish, knocking out CNN's signal for eight hours. But a spokesman
said no transmissions had been planned during the period of the
blackout, which began at 9 p.m. EST.
   The storm also briefly affected ABC. Rain shorted out an
electrical connection at the start of anchor Peter Jenning's live
summit report from Malta during the first of two ``World News
Tonight'' broadcasts that ABC sends its affiliates each night.
   But the Maltese connection was quickly restored. Jennings came
back on with his report eight minutes later.
   The storm didn't much affect CBS and NBC coverage of Saturday's
summit, to which the four U.S. networks brought a total of nearly
200 staff members.
   On Sunday, the weather was much better. But an electronic
problem caused a translation problem for NBC and CNN during the
live telecast of the superpower leaders' joint news conference
aboard the safely docked Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky.
   The Soviets provided the TV pool feed for broadcasters and an
audio channel offering a simultaneous English translations of
Gorbachev's remarks.
   However, during the last half hour of the session, an electronic
glitch knocked out the English-language channel. CBS and ABC had
translators standing by, so viewers didn't miss anything.
   NBC hastily summoned a Soviet official on Malta, but missed
eight minutes of translation.
   CNN went the long way for help. After 13 minutes in which Shaw
recapped summit news while Gorbachev was speaking, an American
woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's comments.
She was Siobahn Darrow, translating from CNN headquarters in
Atlanta, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   The summit capped a busy week for the networks, during which
their anchors were based in Prague, Rome, and in the case of ABC,
West Germany.

   Cable News Network today said CNN newsman
Bernard Shaw and a former Texas judge will be co-anchors of ``The
World Today,'' a new evening newscast that will go head to head
with the big three networks.
   The former judge, 34-year-old Catherine Crier, has no news
background. When hired last month by CNN, she resigned as a state
judge in Dallas. She was elected to that job in 1985.
   CNN's new one-hour newscast, which premieres Monday, will start
at 6 p.m. EDT. Its second half hour will compete directly with the
nightly newscats of CBS, NBC and ABC, but only in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two half-hour ``feeds'' of their nightly newscasts, tape
their newscasts for broadcast three hours later on the West Coast,
sometimes updating them with live reports. CNN's new show will be
fed live nationally.
   Crier will be co-anchor of ``The World Today'' from CNN
headquarters in Atlanta, and Shaw from CNN's headquarters in
Washington.

<BYLINE>Tensions Rise as U.S. Anchor Buildup Reported in Middle East

<TEXT>
   As the U.S. network anchor buildup continued in
the Middle East, ABC's Peter Jennings was asked if he felt a little
lonely, staying here to anchor ``World News Tonight.''
   ``Not at all,'' said Jennings, who used to cover the Middle East
in his correspondent days. ``I'm in exactly the right place. My job
is to coordinate the coverage, not just go and do one dimension of
it.''
   He spoke last Thursday, as the network anchor total in the
Middle East rose to seven with the arrivals in Saudi Arabia of
NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Sam Donaldson, the latter there for
``PrimeTime Live.''
   It was perhaps the largest array of high-priced anchors since
the Moscow Summit of 1988, when there were so many news stars
running loose only luck prevented a high-speed interview pileup.
   But this time, they're spread out, those who have been sent to
cover and anchor, so to speak, the Middle East crisis caused by
Irag's armed takeover of Kuwait.
   They've reported from Dubai, Jordan, Cairo, Saudi Arabia, and,
in CBS' Dan Rather's case, a Navy carrier from which he anchored _
on tape _ part of one newscast. Rather and ABC's Ted Koppel also
have been the only U.S. anchors to broadcast from Baghdad yet.
NBC's Garrick Utley still is trying to get in.
   Ironically, Ted Turner's global Cable News Network hasn't sent
in an anchor star. It has stuck with its grunts, the
correspondents. Why didn't CNN send in just one of its anchors,
say, Bernard Shaw?
   ``It's because of what we are, as opposed to the other guys,''
says Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering.
``They have half-hour shows, and if that's how they want to use
their anchors, super.''
   (It should be pointed out that Koppel and Rather have done
breaking-news bulletins and report for newscasts on their networks
other than their own, just like the lesser-known, lesser-paid
correspondents.)
   ``But this story, unlike any story I can ever remember, has so
many different locations,'' Turner says. ``And an anchor is
supposed to tie it all together from a central location.
   ``The place to do that is not downtown Baghdad, or downtown
Amman. The place to be is what you consider your news universe.''
   Jennings gives almost the same reason _ ``it's a complicated
story'' _ as the reason he's staying here.
   Koppel, the ``Nightline'' anchor, has scored good beats,
particularly by being the first U.S. network newsman into Iraq,
Jennings says, but ``I can't go off and pursue the one thing and
still run our coverage.''
   Rather, says Turner, ``is a helluva reporter. He likes doing
that, he's excited about it, and that's fine. But that's not an
anchor's job . . . if you're really anchoring, you're talking about
holding the show together.''
   Rather has been in the Middle East since the crisis began.
Brokaw started only last Thursday, when he reported for the ``NBC
Nightly News'' and anchored part of it from what seemed a palm
tree-lined oasis.
   Why the delay?
   ``We've been saying all along that if we can get into Baghdad,
Saudi Arabia or Kuwait we would go,'' says the show's executive
producer, Steve Friedman.
   Saudi Arabia, which tightly restricted correspondents' visits
even before the current Gulf crisis, gave Brokaw approval to enter
last week, likewise ABC's Donaldson.
   That approval was ``why we went in'' with Brokaw, says Friedman.
``We've been holding off because I'm not going to send Tom to a
place where I can only get a phone call'' report from the NBC
anchorman.
   With the advent of satellites, the wandering anchorman has
become almost routine. There are varied reasons for moving about,
Jennings says _ to bring attention to particular event or region,
or a single story.
   Another reason The Anchor is sent in on a major story is clout.
   The fact an anchor is well-known and has contacts with major
movers and shakers sometimes gets him interviews or into places
lesser mortals only might dream about. As Friedman puts it:
   ``An anchorman gives you cachet. Because everybody all over
knows who they are. Ted Koppel got into Baghdad because he's Ted
Koppel and worked the story.''
   Media critics, some of whom may yet cover a fire, sometimes
question the validity of anchor expeditions, calling them show-biz
moves intended more to drum up publicity and ratings for network
newscasts than to commit journalism.
   The urbane Jennings would give such carpers the back of his hand:
   ``I don't think they watch what we do. I don't think they even
look at content, or look at the reporting . . . our audience wants
to know what the hell's going on, not where any of us are standing
at any given date.
   ``My advice is to pay less attention to anchors and more to
content.''

   American television coverage of events in
Beijing was disrupted Friday night when Chinese authorities
``pulled the plug'' on live transmissions from Tiananmen Square.
   ``Goodbye from Beijing,'' CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw said as
Cable News Network signed off its broadcasts from the Chinese
capital. It was shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday in Beijing, or 10
p.m. Friday EDT.
   CBS also had its transmissions cut off from the square. NBC was
cut off by virtue of its sharing satellite transmission equipment
with CNN; and ABC said the government had shut down all satellite
feeds from China.
   Later reports via telephone by CNN Anchor Bernard Shaw said
Chinese officials had issued a news blackout that prohibited crews
from videotaping any events in the country related to the
continuing student protests.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong said foreign reporters were forbidden
to ``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not
conduct interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at
government offices, schools, factories and mines.
   ``Any violators will be stopped according to the law,'' the
order said.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said in a telephone interview that
the network was continuing to cover the story of students resuming
a week-old hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in Beijing by live
telephone interviews.
   ``We don't know yet what this order means,'' he said. ``Our
crews cannot move around or even shoot tape, but it's too early to
tell what the impact is.''
   Shaw and Haworth said the crews have not been ordered out of the
country.
   Haworth said that the journalists have 30-day visas and that
crews arrived May 12-14 so ``they're there for a while.''
   Earlier, in a live transmission from the Great Wall Sheraton
Hotel in Beijing, CNN showed a government official writing the
official order _ on a note pad provided by CNN editors _ to shut
down the broadcasts.
   The order came about an hour after martial law was declared in
parts of Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of
thousands of Chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms.
   CNN requested the order in writing because it had legal
agreements with the Chinese government to broadcast from Beijing,
editors said in the live transmission.
   The government official said the agreement had been designed for
coverage of the visit to China of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, which ended Friday.
   CBS News broke into the network's season finale broadcast of
``Dallas'' to show anchorman Dan Rather at the network's control
center in Beijing's Hotel Shangri-La as Chinese officials ordered
the network to end its broadcasts.
   Rather reported that Chinese officials ``pulled the plug'' on
live transmissions from Tiananmen Square just after several
helicopters flew over the square. Tape showed Rather preparing to
broadcast from the square, then a screen full of interference.
   He said that when he returned to the control center he was met
by representatives of the government television system saying
they'd been told by the Foreign Ministry to end CBS's broadcasts.
   The written order to CNN said it must shut down the moveable
earth station transmitting its signal to a satellite. Transmission
ceased about four minutes later, after network executives in CNN's
Atlanta headquarters told the staff to obey the letter.
   ``In my 20 years of news reporting I've never seen anything like
this,'' Shaw said before signing off.
   Donna Dees, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said representatives of
the government-run television company were preparing an official
order, similar to CNN's, to put the network off the air.
   After being cut off from Tiananmen Square, CBS was able to
continue with reports from its headquarters at a nearby hotel, but
even that appeared threatened by the impending order, she said.
   ABC had ordered two feeds from China on Friday night using
Chinese television equipment, said spokesman Scott Richardson, but
were apparently caught by the official blackout.
   Bill Baxter, manager of the network desk for NBC News, said the
network shared a satellite with CNN and was unable to get a signal
out of China. He said efforts to book other satellite time were
also stymied by the official blackout.
   Efforts by the Chinese to end live transmissions began at about
8 p.m. EDT, Haworth said. CNN's live China coverage went briefly
off the air at 9:21 p.m. EDT but resumed live coverage several
minutes later.
   Officials then issued a statement that ``we would be live until
they physically unplugged us or issued a written declaration of why
we were to leave, which they did shortly thereafter,'' according to
Haworth.
   Haworth said the shutdown apparently was not due to any specific
coverage by CNN but because the Chinese are ``anxious about
resolving problems in Tiananmen but not on live television.''

   Cable News Network pulled the plug on
unchallenged commentaries, including the wry observations of Linda
Ellerbee, in an unexplained ``management decision,'' CNN spokesmen
said Thursday.
   Commentaries on CNN's discussion programs, and the opposing
views expressed on them, will continue on the 24-hour schedule.
Those programs are ``Crossfire,'' ``Evans &amp; Novak'' and the
``Capitol Gang.''
   CNN gave no reason for the end Monday to free-standing
commentaries, including those of Ellerbee, Robert Novak, Marty
Schramm, weatherman Flip Spiceland and sportscaster Jim Huber.
   Steve Haworth, a spokesman at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, said
``it was just a management decision.''
   All of the commentators but Ellerbee do other work for CNN.
   ``We hope to keep her on the air in some capacity,'' said CNN
spokesman John Bianchi in New York.
   A recent editorial in The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash.,
criticized a Spiceland commentary in which the weatherman said
women's logic ``is one of those contradictory terms like military
intelligence.''
   Haworth would not comment on reports that Ted Turner, who owns
CNN parent Turner Broadcasting System, ordered the end of
unchallenged commentaries after the editorial.
   Of the major network evening newscasts, only the ``NBC Nightly
News'' still regularly airs commentary, by John Chancellor. ABC's
``World News Tonight'' does it on an irregular basis with George
Will, said Elise Adde, an ABC News spokeswoman.
   CBS, whose ``CBS Evening News'' commentaries in recent years
were by Bill Moyers, discontinued them after Moyers quit in 1986
and returned to public TV. CBS, however, still has the only network
humorous commentator working in prime time television _ Andy Rooney
of ``60 Minutes.''

   The week before Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in
the United States for the December arms summit, President Reagan
granted a rare interview to the four major networks' anchors.
   That's right, four: Peter Jennings of ABC, Dan Rather of CBS,
Tom Brokaw of NBC, and Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor for CNN.
   Although he had already interviewed Reagan in October, Shaw
agreed that the prime-time news special in which he questioned
Reagan along with the three other anchors was a high-profile symbol
of CNN's hard-earned respectability.
   ``That conversation the week before the summit was a turning
point, I suppose you would have to say,'' said Shaw in an interview
at his anchor desk at the CNN bureau. ``I went back and asked
(White House Chief of Staff) Howard Baker about that, and he said,
`We regard you as the fourth network, and that's why we included
you in the interview.'''
   The Reagan interview turned a lot of unsought attention on the
low-key Shaw, a former correspondent for ABC, CBS and Westinghouse
Broadcasting, who recalls idolizing Edward R. Murrow as a child in
Chicago and at 13 declaring, ``I want to be a CBS News
correspondent.''
   After stints with Westinghouse and CBS, then covering Latin
America for ABC, Shaw joined CNN in 1980. He wanted to be an
anchor, and ``there was no room at the inn at ABC, a lot of other
talented people standing in line.'' Plus, he was encouraged to join
the then-fledgling 24-hour news network by friends Daniel Schorr
and George Watson, the Washington bureau chief.
   The next year, John Hinckley shot President Reagan outside a
Washington hotel where Reagan had just delivered a speech.
   Shaw had finished his news update summarizing the speech and
switched back to CNN headquarters in Atlanta when a staffer told
him someone had fired shots at the president's motorcade.
   ``I screamed to the control room to tell Atlanta to come back to
us right away,'' Shaw said. Shaw filled viewers in with the sketchy
information he had, then switched back to Atlanta, but Reese
Schoenfield, then president of CNN, ordered Atlanta to go back to
Washington and stay there.
   ``And they did, and there we were,'' said Shaw. He was on the
air for 10 hours.
   ``I was pretty conscious that day of my demeanor, tone of voice
and facial expressions,'' he said, ``because that camera magnifies
everything, and I was determined to be as low-key as possible, as
factual as possible and as dispassionate as possible. A story like
that requires no heat.''
   Low-key is the operative word in describing Shaw's style. He
considers the celebrity aspects of his job ``corruptive'' and
prefers to spend his free time with his wife, Linda, and their two
children. Besides ``doing better'' in his job at CNN, Shaw, 47,
says his only ambition is to write books, fiction and non-fiction.
   He's a perfectionist who constantly worries about improving his
performance and the network's. He said that when he left the air
after the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, he lay awake for hours
``replaying in my head what we did _ what we did right, what we did
wrong, what I could have done better.''
   ``He does his homework every time and worries over it like it's
his first time, and calls afterwards to be critiqued on it,'' said
CNN Executive Vice President Ed Turner. ``I don't know anybody as
good as he is, in my 30 years in the business, at his specialty,
which was a job once done brilliantly by (Walter) Cronkite, before
him by (Robert) Trout, people who can sit with a breaking story for
hours on end and never lose the various threads that you have to
keep hold of.''
   If it's grueling to be on the air for hours on end, it's also
fulfilling.
   While his colleagues at the other networks struggle to get even
an hour or two of prime-time coverage for the primaries, Shaw, who
anchors CNN's political coverage, gets the whole night.
   ``There was a magical moment, or hour, between 9 and 10 o'clock
in Manchester (N.H.),'' he recalled, ``and it seemed like every
candidate was coming down to the ballroom to make statements. And
it just looked like a visual ballet, where we went from Kemp to
Gephardt to Bush to Dole, or what have you. And I looked up on the
monitors, and we were the only ones on the air. And I felt good.''

<HEAD>CNN, Once Called ``Chicken Noodle News,'' Celebrates 10th Year
Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It began 10 years ago today with 300 employees,
$400 million in start-up costs and 12 bureaus. But critics who
laughingly called it `Chicken Noodle News'' then are eating crow
now.
   Ted Turner's Cable News Network, originally seen in only 1.7
million U.S. homes, now is in 54 million. It has nearly 1,800
staffers and 27 bureaus worldwide and is seen in 90 countries,
including the Soviet Union. And it became profitable in 1985.
   That the 24-hour network is a global presence as well as a
big-league rival of the news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC was
neatly noted during the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw, interviewing a Panama City resident by phone
for ``Today,'' asked if a TV station there was describing what was
going on.
   ``Well,'' the man replied, ``they're actually relaying the CNN
broadcast.''
   Such recognition, by either a man in Panama or world leaders,
was an uncertain dream when Ed Turner _ no relation to Ted _
reported for duty at CNN's temporary offices in Atlanta six months
before operations began.
   Battle stations were in an ancient building resembling, well, an
ideal fixer-upper. Turner, now CNN's executive vice president,
recalls that ``it looked like something off of Tobacco Road, only
not that nice.''
   Turner is a veteran of more than 20 years in news, including a
stop at CBS, where he produced the ``CBS Morning News.''
   He was running an Oklahoma City station when CNN beckoned.
   ``They said, `Come on down and try,''' says Turner, a native
Oklahoman with a deadpan sense of humor. ``And who could say no to
something that everybody said was going to be a sure failure?''
   Ted Turner himself became a recruiter, according to a new book,
``CNN: The Inside Story.'' It says he tried to hire ... Walter
Cronkite. The famous, respected then-CBS anchorman politely and
indirectly said no.
   Lesser news stars who nonetheless also were respected said yes.
   They included two who became the best-known of CNN's original
anchors: Mary Alice Williams from New York's WNBC-TV _ she returned
to NBC last April _ and Bernard Shaw, a no-nonsense former Marine
from ABC who still is at CNN in Washington.
   When he joined CNN, had he any feelings he might be joining the
crew of television's Titanic? ``No,'' Shaw says, ``I'm a good
swimmer.''
   Network news still was riding high and considered The Place to
Work when Ed Turner joined CNN. But he found few cries of ``you
must be mad'' when recruiting CNN's grunts _ reporters, producers,
writers, bureau chiefs.
   ``Generally, they were interested,'' he says. ``It was trying to
sell the wife, or the husband, as the case may be. But the desire
to gamble was considerable among the journalists. A lot of them
said, `Why not?'''
   The arguments against were considerable: low pay, long hours, no
unions where possible and the distinct chance that at any minute
the whole shebang might go poof. Indeed, CNN lost $16 million its
first year.
   But local TV news had burgeoned in the 1970s, Turner notes, and
many younger local newsies were ready for the majors. But the
networks were full up.
   ``We came along at the right time,'' he says.
   The new arrivals, he says, ``hadn't been tainted by exposure to
the other networks, where in those days they had so much help and
logistical support, and so many nice limousines, it'd ruin you from
remembering to go out and get a story.''
   The hardest part, he says, was getting recognition, from
advertisers, newsmakers and viewers. That long since has been
solved, particularly among Washington's movers and shakers.
   It wasn't always so in that hamlet, one of the last major cities
to get cable. That's why CNN in its early days gave away satellite
dishes to the White House, the Pentagon and the House and Senate,
says Turner.
   But he thinks the real turning point came at the 1984 Democratic
convention in San Francisco, when CNN got a booth, just like the
Big Three, overlooking the convention floor:
   ``That to me,'' he says, ``was a symbol of `There's a new
big-time player around, folks.'''
   That player now isn't seen only on cable or what it says are
950,000 hotel rooms _ 700,000 in the U.S. and Canada and the
balance abroad.
   Some of its reports also are seen on the news programs of 250
U.S. stations that are CNN affiliates, Turner says. Significantly,
the majority _ 160 _ also are network affiliates.
   But Turner, while he enjoys needling the networks, doesn't
believe the nightly network newscasts that once ruled the national
news roost are going the way of the pterodactyl _ at least not all
three.
   ``I think that they will survive in some form, perhaps not as
formal half-hours, but as update services or feeds to their
affiliate stations. One or two may continue (in their present
form). But they have to find a new editorial presentation.''
   That, he says, is because it is a different game now, with CNN
going strong and many local news operations airing national and
international reports before Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan
Rather start their newscasts.
   As Turner sees things, a big problem for the Big Three is that
``the surprise factor _ the `Hey, Martha, come here and look' _ is
gone.''

   As communications between each of the three major U.S.
broadcast networks and their correspondents in Baghdad were
cut off within the first few minutes after war against Iraq
began last night, only the all-news Cable News Network was
somehow able to maintain contact with its three-member team.
   The extraordinary performance by the crew of Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. was underscored when NBC News
anchor Tom Brokaw interviewed the CNN correspondents,
including a rival anchor, Bernard Shaw, and reporters Peter
Arnett and John Holliman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the conclusion of the brief interview, Mr. Brokaw asked
Mr. Shaw how it was that CNN had telephone contact, while the
other three networks lost touch almost immediately. After a
lengthy pause, Mr. Shaw said he would have to "pass" on
answering. "I'll explain it the next time I see you,
profusely," Mr. Shaw said.
   In Washington, when reporters asked Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney last night what was happening in Iraq, the secretary
replied with a smile that the best information he had about
Baghdad came from CNN.
   CNN is seen live in Baghdad. CNN officials couldn't be
reached to comment on how the network kept its telephone line
open. According to the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings service,
CNN's overnight ratings from 25 major cities jumped an
astounding 271% Tuesday evening, compared with the same night
a week earlier.
   The three major networks instantly switched to previously
announced plans to broadcast round-the-clock coverage of the
war in the Persian Gulf. Only the ABC network, a unit of New
York-based Capital Cities/ABC Inc., broke for commericals,
twice in the first two hours of the coverage.

RATHER TO COVER SINO-SOVIET SUMMIT

Last February, what some called the Battle of the Burberrys erupted when
trench-coated Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings went to Japan to cover
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito and report on the changing social, economic and
political conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Next week, though, only CBS' Rather of network anchordom's Big Three will be in
China anchoring coverage of the Sino-Soviet summit meeting of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev and China's Deng Xiaoping, the first such meeting since 1958.
</P>
<P>
Rather will have a cable competitor: CNN's Bernard Shaw, who, backed by three
correspondents, also will be anchoring there, starting Sunday, when he'll do
three live newscasts, starting at 4 p.m. PDT.
</P>
<P>
ABC and NBC will have correspondents in China -- three for NBC and four for
ABC, including one for ABC's "Nightline." But anchormen Peter Jennings of ABC
and Tom Brokaw of NBC are staying home this time, their networks say.
</P>
<P>
The CBS expedition is by no means as ambitious as the $2.5-million pilgrimage
the network mounted for the Japan trip, when Rather's newscast, "48 Hours" and
"CBS This Morning" all originated from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
But five CBS correspondents will be part of a week's worth of "CBS Evening
News" broadcasts from China that start Monday, preceded by a special 90-minute
"Sunday Morning" that Charles Kuralt will anchor from there.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reporting whatever news emerges from next week's summit, all
three networks and CNN will be doing stories that seek perspective on the
meeting and what all this means for communism.
</P>
<P>
Rather considers the CBS expedition part of what he calls a "new wave" in
network news coverage.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that network news is sometimes at its best when it's concentrating
on those things that affiliated stations either cannot do, or choose not to do
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the China trip, he said, is to strike more of a balance in
foreign coverage, giving the Pacific Rim as much attention as the Atlantic
side.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that print and TV journalism "historically has been too
European-focused," he said he's "trying to get us to have more balance between
looking across the Atlantic and looking across the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
Rather, who first went to China in 1972, covering President Richard Nixon's
historic trip, also says that being on the scene again in a much-changed China
will help him deal with future stories about that nation.
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think, from a windowless room on the West Side of Manhattan, that
you can expect to be in touch with the world simply through technology," he
said. "You've got to be a wear-out-shoe-leather, go-there reporter at least
some of the time. Otherwise, you're out of touch."
</P>
<P>
While ABC's Jennings isn't going to China, a network spokeswoman said that he
and "World News Tonight" will broadcast from Brussels and London, starting May
29, as part of ABC's coverage of the coming NATO meetings.
</P>
<P>
A CBS spokeswoman said that it's expected that Rather and his "CBS Evening
News" also will will do that. An NBC spokeswoman said there are no plans for
Brokaw's "NBC Nightly News" to make that trip.

<HEAD>CNN to Launch New Hour-Long Newscast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network plans to launch an assault on
the three major broadcast networks next month with an hour-long
dinner-time newscast.
   CNN, which went after the big three TV networks in 1980 with
round-the-clock news, will begin airing the newscast from 6 p.m.-7
p.m. EDT on Oct. 16.
   Because the network's newscasts are carried live in each time
zone, the program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast.
   Currently, CNN runs ``Newswatch'' from 5-6:30 p.m. EDT and shows
the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30 p.m. CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said the new plan calls for ``Show Biz
Today'' to air at 5:30 p.m. EDT and ``Newswatch'' to run from 5-5:30
p.m. EDT.
   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine
Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchor
the new program was premature.
   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joins
us,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When
she comes up with us and starts doing some training, we'll start
figuring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''
   Haworth said the program would be designed to ``go head-to-head
with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour of news at 6:30
p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.
   CNN, which started in June 1980, has sports, commentary, talk and
specialty shows. But most of its 24-hour schedule is updated news
presentations.

   Catherine Crier, a former Texas judge with no
news experience, and Bernard Shaw, who has 25 years in broadcast
news, became TV's newest anchor team Monday with CNN's new ``The
World Today.''
   Crier, who never worked in news until she reported for work two
weeks ago at Cable News Network, made only three slight verbal
flubs and wasn't visibily nervous in her debut on camera and on the
one-hour weeknight series.
   Crier was in CNN headquarters in Atlanta, while Shaw, with CNN
since its creation in 1979, was in Washington.
   Their newscast, which CNN promotions say ``will change the face
of evening news,'' is CNN's first major push against the ``CBS
Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' and the ``NBC Nightly
News.''
   However, only its second half-hour directly competes with those
broadcasts, and only in the Eastern and Central time zones. It
starts each night at 6 p.m. EDT and is nationally broadcast then,
with no taped repeats for the West Coast.
   West Coast affiliates of the major networks tape the networks'
nightly newscasts for broadcast three or 3{ hours after those
programs appear in the East.

CBS PLANS EXTRA COVERAGE OF BUSH'S STATE VISIT TO JAPAN
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Correspondents and news anchors from the three major TV networks and CNN will
be traveling to Japan next week to cover President Bush's visit for the state
funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
But CBS News is going its rivals one better for the outing, Bush's first
foreign trip as chief executive. The network will spend more than $2 million to
originate much of its weekly news programming in Japan in what anchorman Dan
Rather described Wednesday as "the most ambitious (news project) CBS has
undertaken in peacetime."
</P>
<P>
All next week, CBS plans to broadcast from Japan the "CBS Evening News" that
Rather anchors and "CBS This Morning." In addition, the prime-time news program
"48 Hours," also anchored by Rather, will air from there next Thursday, when
the emperor's funeral services begin.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's "Sunday Morning" news magazine also will come from Tokyo, with "Face
the Nation" originating the following Sunday from Beijing -- the second of
Bush's three stops while in Asia.
</P>
<P>
ABC won't be doing as much as CBS but, starting Monday, its "World News
Tonight" will have Asian-segment anchoring and reporting by anchor Peter
Jennings all week from Japan. He'll also anchor the Asian segments during
Bush's stops in Beijing and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ted Koppel will stay home in Washington, although his "Nightline" will air
reports from Bush's trip, as will ABC's "World News This Morning" and "This
Week With David Brinkley."
</P>
<P>
NBC, whose "NBC Nightly News" on Wednesday began a three-part series on Japan's
social, political and economic changes, has a somewhat more modest effort
afoot. The network says Tom Brokaw will anchor his "Nightly News" from Tokyo
next Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brokaw also will anchor next weekend's newscasts from China, and contribute
reports for that weekend's "Sunday Today."
</P>
<P>
CNN, meanwhile, is dispatching anchors Bernard Shaw and Mary Alice Williams,
plus three other correspondents. Its live telecasts of the funeral services for
the emperor are slated to start at 5 p.m. PDT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CBS' Rather, Charles Kuralt of "Sunday Morning," and Kathleen Sullivan and
Harry Smith of "CBS This Morning," are among 15 correspondents and at least 55
other staffers making the trip for CBS.
</P>
<P>
The number of CBS personnel could double with local hires of interpreters,
pages, couriers and other support troops.
</P>
<P>
Why so many? Part of the reason is that CBS -- saluted here Wednesday at a
luncheon held by the Japan Society -- is handling the American TV pool coverage
for Bush's trip, and would need a larger support staff anyway.
</P>
<P>
But another reason is that the Jan. 7 death of Japan's 87-year-old Emperor
"puts a period to the postwar era," Rather said in an earlier interview in
which he sounded the CBS expedition's "what's next?" theme -- officially called
"U.S.-Japan: Dawn of a New Era."
</P>
<P>
In coming months, he said, a lot more of CBS' reporting will be looking to
Asia, the continuing Pacific Rim story, and what happens "in the new postwar
era" in which Japan is an economic superpower.
</P>
<P>
"So we think the emperor's funeral is a good starting point for bringing the
audience's attention, our own attention, to . . . what's next" in
American-Japanese relations, from financial to cultural, he added.
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session at Wednesday's lunch, he credited CBS News
President David Burke as coming up with the idea for the special coverage and
noted that it would cost $2 million "at the minimum."
</P>
<P>
"It's a gamble for us. . . . We have more chips on the table than our
competitors," he said. However, he added, if it works, "I think we will do this
kind of thing in the future" in other areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
Next week's coverage will have one unique aspect that is part of efforts by the
Big Three networks to build overseas markets at at time when increased
competition has reduced their audience at home.
</P>
<P>
Many Japanese television viewers will be able to see what CBS, ABC and CNN
newscasts are reporting about their emperor's funeral and their country.
</P>
<P>
Rather's "Evening News" has been aired by the Tokyo Broadcasting System since
October, 1987, usually at 5:30 a.m., with a dual audio channel providing
versions in English and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Some news reports from Jennings' "World News Tonight" -- but not the complete
program -- now also are shown in Japan. They are broadcast by the NHK network
to homes equipped with satellite dishes that can receive the direct-to-home
satellite signal aired by NHK, according to an NHK official here. He said NHK
plans to start airing the full half-hour program later this year.
</P>
<P>
CNN's newscasts are available in 50,000 hotel rooms in Toyko, on "several
thousand" cable-equipped homes in Japan, and also on the Asahi television
system in Tokyo, a CNN spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
NBC's newscasts are not yet shown in Japan, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"CBS Evening News" executive producer Tom Bettag, discussing broadcasts of
Rather's program in Japan, frankly admitted that "we are trying very hard to
promote those (overseas) relationships.
</P>
<P>
"I think American television, and particularly American television news, is
having a lot of impact internationally. . . . We're shown in a hell of a lot of
countries and have remarkably strong ratings."

<HEAD>Dan Rather Leaves Iraq, TV Now Covering Crisis From the Borders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anchorman Dan Rather and other CBS employees
left Iraq on Tuesday under the orders of Iraqi authorities, a
spokeswoman said.
   ``All of the CBS newspeople were politely asked to be out
today,'' said CBS News spokeswoman Donna Dees.
   ``We were staying as long as we could stay and not put anybody's
life in danger,'' she said. ``Clearly, we reached almost that point
where we might not have gotten out.''
   Reporters for The Associated Press and other newsgathering
organizations continue to work in Iraq, which invaded Kuwait nearly
three weeks ago.
   The CBS contingent flew to Amman, Jordan, where Rather will
continue to cover the story along with correspondents Allen Pizzey
and Peter Van Sant.
   Ms. Dees said she could not say how many CBS staffers are in
Jordan. A CBS source, however, said the network is keeping about 30
people in Jordan.
   The CBS contingent got to Baghdad on Wednesday, 12 hours after
an ABC crew led by ``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel. Koppel left
Baghdad on Thursday, followed several days later by his ABC
colleagues.
   ``We have been advancing the story of the Americans left there
(in Iraq),'' Ms. Dees said. ``It's been our story all weekend.''
   CBS correspondents in the region include Bob Simon in Saudi
Arabia; Bill McLaughlin in Cairo, Doug Tunnel in Dubai, and Martha
Teischner in Tel Aviv.
   NBC's ``Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw on Tuesday returned to
New York City from Saudi Arabia, where he had been anchoring the
network's coverage of the invasion.
   ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel remains in Saudi Arabia, as does
correspondent Arthur Kent. In Amman, NBC's on-air reporting is by
correspondents Garrick Utley, Dennis Murphy and Keith Miller.
   Other NBC correspondents include Tom Aspell in Dubai, Rick Davis
and Mike Boettcher in Cairo, Tom Pettit in Iran, and Ike Seamans in
Tel Aviv.
   ``Overall, we have about 70 people involved in this coverage,
and that doesn't include translators, drivers and other support
staff,'' said NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay.
   ABC's coverage of the Mideast crisis is still being anchored
here by ``World News Tonight'' anchor Peter Jennings, who had been
the network's Beirut bureau chief and has anchored all special
report coverage.
   Correspondents on the story include Sam Donaldson and Mike Von
Fremd in Saudi Arabia; Jim Hickey in Cairo, Mike Lee in Dubai,
United Arab Emirates; Peter Collins in Ankara, Turkey.
   ABC has three correspondents in Amman: Forrest Sawyer, John
McKenzie and John Donvan. ABC spokesman Scott Richardson had no
exact figures on the number of people covering the story.
   The Cable News Network kept its anchor, Bernard Shaw, in
Washington. ``He's doing what he's supposed to be doing,'' said
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy.
   CNN on Tuesday had three correspondents in Amman: Rich Roth, Jim
Clancy and Robert Weiner; Christiane Amanpour and John Sweeney
covered the story from Saudi Arabia, where CNN's Carl Rochelle was
a Pentagon pool reporter.
   CNN's Jonathan Mann was shuttling between Tripoli and Cairo, and
Doug James was in Dubai. CNN also has between 45 and 50 editorial
and technical staffers on duty in the Middle East.

   Weather-weary network crews packed their gear
and left Malta on Sunday after storms there caused hasty changes
and technical problems in their coverage of the summit meeting.
   CBS and NBC coverage Saturday of the meeting between President
Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't much affected,
despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon
and dinner meetings that day.
   But the day's 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set CNN had built
near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard
summit, and also blew down and damaged a CNN satellite dish.
   That knocked out CNN's TV signal for eight hours, starting at 9
p.m. EST, although a network spokesman in Malta said most of the TV
blackout occurred when little was going on and no transmissions
were planned.
   Saturday's storm also affected ABC, but only briefly. Rain
shorted out an electrical connection right at the start of ABC
anchorman Peter Jenning's live summit report from Malta during the
first of two ``World News Tonight'' broadcasts that ABC sends its
affiliates each night.
   The broadcast was hurriedly reshaped in Washington while still
on the air. Anchorwoman Carole Simpson reported other news while
the Malta connection was restored, and Jennings came back on with
his report eight minutes later.
   The four networks' anchormen all were in Malta. But only
Jennings was heading to Brussels on Sunday to report Monday night
on Bush's post-summit briefing to NATO leaders. CBS' Dan Rather and
NBC's Tom Brokaw were reported returning to New York, and CNN's
Bernard Shaw was en route to Washington.
   Before Saturday's storm, the networks had planned to transmit
live TV pictures by microwave from the planned sites of the summit
_ two guided missile cruisers, the U.S. Navy's Belknap and the
Soviet navy's Slava.
   But when the storm forced the summit site changed to the safely
docked Soviet luxury ship Maxim Gorky, CBS, running the TV pool for
the U.S. networks, had to scramble to install a microwave linkup to
the Gorky.
   ``They (the Soviets) invited the pool to put a microwave aboard.
... We had to rip things apart to do that,'' Don DeCesare, CBS
News' director of news coverage, said Saturday night from Malta.
``It took all day to do it.''
   But just as technicans had things working, he said, Saturday's
planned second meeting between Bush and Gorbachev was called off.
   The leaders' Sunday news conference on the Gorky was televised
live, with the Soviets providing both the TV pool feed for
broadcasters and an audio channel offering a simultaneous English
translations of Gorbachev's remarks.
   But broadcast woes continued. During the session's last half
hour, an electronic glitch knocked out the English-language audio
channel.
   CBS and ABC continued with their own backup Russian-speaking
translators. NBC hastily brought in a Soviet official on Malta to
help, but missed eight minutes of translation.
   CNN went the long way for help _ to Atlanta. After 13 minutes in
which Shaw recapped summit news while Gorbachev was speaking, an
American woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's
comments.
   The woman was Siobahn Darrow, a CNN staff member. A spokeswoman
said Darrow was listening to and translating Gorbachev's remarks
from CNN headquarters in Atlanta.

   A former Texas judge with no news background and

   Catherine Crier, 34, was elected in 1985 as a state district
court judge assigned to Dallas. She resigned last month and became
a CNN staf member Oct. 1.
   The new anchor team was announced Tuesday by CNN, whose new
one-hour program will start at 6 p.m. EDT. The second half hour
will directly compete with the nightly newscasts of CBS, NBC and
ABC, but only in Eastern and Central time zones.
   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two ``feeds'' of their nightly 30-minute newscasts,
tape-delay those programs for broadcast three hours later on the
West Coast, sometimes updating them with live reports.
   In contrast, CNN's ``The World Today'' will air live nationally.
Crier will co-anchor the program from CNN headquarters in Atlanta,
with Shaw, who has 25 years in news, in Washington, D.C.

<P>
Cable News Network anchor Bernard Shaw, still in Beijing, spent Sunday fully
expecting the authorities to cut all phone lines out of China, severing the
last link of live reports by foreign broadcasters there.
</P>
<P>
And then, he said in a late-night phone interview as Army troops massed to
clear Tian An Ming Square of hundreds of thousands of protesters, "We just sit
here until the government feels it has control of the situation and can loosen
the screws."
</P>
<P>
CBS' Dan Rather, meanwhile, arrived home in New York, instructed by his bosses
to leave Beijing Saturday when, he said, it appeared the airport might be shut
down. He stopped in Tokyo to drop off news footage taped before and after
authorities ordered CBS and CNN to shut down their portable transmitters and
pulled the plug for NBC and ABC at the state-run China Central Television
satellite uplink station.
</P>
<P>
The live shots of the CBS and CNN shutdowns Friday night -- CNN was first to go
at 7:05 p.m. PDT (11:05 a.m. Saturday in Beijing), followed by CBS at 8:49 p.m.
PDT -- dramatically symbolized the news dimout for American and other foreign
networks.
</P>
<P>
But their reports continued by phone, with their networks showing photos of the
reporters, maps of Beijing, pre-shutdown tapes or fresh footage taped despite
severe restrictions by Chinese authorities and "pigeoned" out of Beijing by
departing staffers or travelers.
</P>
<P>
It all occurred in an extraordinary week for the networks -- one that began
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's historic China visit, and evolved into
high-tension confrontations that had exhausted reporters and producers working
almost nonstop.
</P>
<P>
It was a particularly extraordinary week for both Shaw and Rather. The latter,
in addition to signing off Friday as CBS' plug was pulled, also anchored a "48
Hours" special Thursday from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable -- we all came here to cover a summit and we walked into a
revolution," Shaw told viewers shortly before CNN's satellite link was cut,
preceded by dramatic split-screen shots of Jane Maxwell, CNN special events
vice president in Atlanta, talking with officials in Beijing, trying to keep
the video line open.
</P>
<P>
"I personally expect next a cutting of all telephone communications out of here
and a shutting down of the airport," Shaw said Sunday. "I just regard it as
standard operating procedure."
</P>
<P>
On CBS' Sunday newscast, CBS Beijing bureau chief John Sheahan, was reporting
live by phone of the possibility of a "massacre" in the streets when army
troops moved to clear Tian An Men Square.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Shaw said, the government had briefly jammed reception of
network newscasts dealing with the China story. That stopped, he said, "but I
expect it to continue."
</P>
<P>
Shaw and Rather were the only American network news anchors on the scene all
week, NBC and ABC having decided to keep Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings here.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a story," said Rather, adding that he wanted to stay but that
CBS officials, who only had 20 minutes to decide whether he should catch what
might prove the last flight from Beijing for a while, told him to leave.
</P>
<P>
Rival ABC and NBC had correspondents reporting from Beijing, but the sounds of
teeth gnashing in envy could be heard in New York.
</P>
<P>
"We're getting our butts kicked," one stateside NBC producer moaned to a friend
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
For NBC, the timing of its keep-Brokaw-here decision was awkward. Friday's
plug-pulling in Beijing came as NBC's affiliates were gathering in San
Francisco for their annual convention.
</P>
<P>
But NBC News President Michael Gartner didn't think the decision was a
mistake."No, of course not," he said Saturday from San Francisco. Referring to
NBC's staff in Beijing, including Asian veterans George Lewis and Kenley Jones,
he said he was "happy with the work that everybody who's been over there. . .
."
</P>
<P>
ABC sent a 30-man crew that among other things shot footage of CNN's
plug-pulling, 20 seconds of which it provided CNN late Friday. But worried
about a potentially explosive situation in Panama, the network kept Jennings
here.
</P>
<P>
Like others in CNN's 60-member delegation, Shaw, who celebrates his 49th
birthday today, had averaged only about two or three hours of sleep a day,
feeding the 24-hour-a-day network with constant updates watched closely by both
American viewers and rival networks.
</P>
<P>
CBS' Sheahan, part of CBS' 60-member Beijing contingent, wasn't surprised that
authorities ordered CBS' satellite uplink shut down hours before CBS'
permission to use it expired.
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, about 600 viewers in New York were outraged and called in
complaints Friday night -- not about the government's action, but CBS' two live
reports -- one for three minutes, then other for 18 minutes -- that interrupted
the season-ending episode of "Dallas." Later, the broadcast of "Beauty and the
Beast" in Los Angeles was interrupted for another 3-minute live report from
Beijing that ended at 8:49 PDT, when a network technician flicked a switch and
the screen faded to video snow.
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, Rather said he'd heard that one viewer called to say, "I
was watching Dan Rather and he was interrupted by 'Dallas,' and what's going on
here?' "
</P>
<P>
Shaw, who with colleagues Mike Chinoy, Steve Hurst and producer Alec Miran
worked in relays, wasn't surprised that phone links weren't shut down at the
same time the government pulled the plug on video transmissions.
</P>
<P>
"I think they want to get everything lined up" before they start quelling
demonstrations, he said. "They want it to be precise . . . they want whatever
they do to be effective."
</P>
<P>
With phone links still open Friday night, it was possible for CNN's Beijing
staff to Fax the government's official, written, earth-station shut-down order
to CNN executive Jane Maxwell in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
She said the authorities threatened to confiscate CNN's satellite uplink if the
order wasn't obeyed.
</P>
<P>
"That was a real concern," she said Saturday, shortly after an ABC News crew,
as part of its coverage of the story, taped an interview with her.
</P>
<P>
Reporters in Beijing had another major concern when martial law was imposed
Friday. It was Municipal Order No. 3, in which foreign reporters' movements
were sharply restricted, and taping and interviews with Chinese forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The movement restrictions, CBS bureau chief Sheahan said by phone Saturday,
included barring reporters from Tian An Men Square, a 40-minute drive from the
CBS encampment at a hotel with a now-ironic name -- the Shangri-La Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he'd met with no hostility from the students, their professors
and ordinary residents of Beijing, even though on Saturday "they kept coming up
to us and saying, 'Well, haven't you heard? You foreigners aren't allowed to be
here, to take pictures.'
</P>
<P>
"We'd ask, 'Do you want us to leave?' And they'd say, 'No, no, you must tell
the world what's going on here.' "

   Preceded by ``here-come-de-judge'' jokes and
headlines about viewer juries, CNN's new ``The World Today''
premieres tonight, co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and former Texas
judge Catherine Crier.
   It will be a closely watched event. It's Crier's debut in news.
And it marks a direct CNN push, if only in half the nation, against
the ``CBS Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC
Nightly News.''
   Crier, 34, had no experience at all as a journalist when hired
by Cable News Network, whose action startled many in news. She only
has had two weeks on the job at CNN. Shaw, with CNN since it began
in 1979, is a 25-year veteran in news who came up the hard,
traditional way.
   Although he has declined to comment, he reportedly was more than
a little miffed at her hiring. Crier says she knows nothing of
that: ``That's not the message I've been receiving. And I've been
working with him.''
   She meant rehearsals of the new show. Crier, who will co-anchor
it at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, with Shaw co-anchoring in
Washington, is aware that a certain amount of criticism may follow
her on-air debut tonight.
   ``I'm not as worried about that initial round as I will be six
months or a year down the road'' if criticism continues, she says.
``Because I am brand new to the business, and I acknowledge that,
and have a lot to learn.''
   She doubtless will be the nation's most watched on-the-job
trainee. But CNN's new one-hour weeknight newscast, starting at 6
p.m. EDT, isn't likely to make a big dent in ratings of the Big
Three for several reasons.
   The major networks twice ``feed'' their half-hour weeknight
newscasts to affiliates, the first feed at 6:30 p.m. EDT. West
Coast affiliates air those newscasts three hours later on a
tape-delay basis.
   In contrast, ``The World Today'' will air live simultaneously in
all time zones, with no tape delays for the West Coast. Thus, its
head-on competition with the Big Three only will be in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   Its potential audience also is smaller because only it only is
on cable. CNN estimates it is seen in 52 million homes. That's
impressive, but there are a total of 92.1 million homes with TV,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures.
   Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering,
downplays the idea of the newcomer representing major competition
to the Big Three.
   ``In the cable world, I don't know that you say you're going to
make a dent in (Nielsen) numbers,'' he says. ``You hope to. But you
look for the kind of audience that's most desirable to sponsors _
some of the better-educated, more affluent viewers ... and we have
a pretty good market for that.''
   NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, referring to shares of audience for
programs, says that the new CNN rival is ``just one more
demonstration that every year, that pie out there is getting sliced
into that many more pieces.''
   But he says he's not certain whether ``The World Today'' is a
potential ratings threat to his newscast and those of CBS and ABC.
   He admires both CNN and Shaw _ ``I don't know anything about
that woman,'' he adds, referring to Crier. But ``my impression
always is that CNN's greatest strengths always have been as a kind
of random viewing place,'' he says.
   ``I don't know if people look for specific programs (there). I
guess that'' _ CNN's new newscast _ ``will be the test for them,
and for us, as well.''

   NBC, continuing its recent tradition of uplifting entertainment,
tonight airs another steamy tale of tawdry. It is ``Roxanne: The
Prize Pulitzer,'' which is set amid the rich in Palm Beach, Fla.,
and lasts for two hours.
   Based on the book of the same name by Roxanne Pulitzer, it
dramatizes her sad story, how her fairy-tale romance with and
marriage to publishing heir Herbert Pulitzer collapsed amid a
flurry of headlines about cocaine, trumpets, and sexual capers that
included one menage-a-trois.
   What to say of this movie? First, it is only her version of what
happened, the latter noted on the screen at the end, no doubt for
legal reasons. It is lushly filmed, and Roxanne mainly is depicted
as an innocent, vulnerable, misused waif.
   But Chynna Phillips is very, very good as poor, poor Roxanne.
One wishes she had a better script. One also wishes that Perry
King, given a one-dimensional part as the man who married the fair
young Roxanne, had hair color that stayed the same.
   Although only a passage of several years is involved here, his
locks are mostly silver in some scenes. In other scenes, the heir's
hair is mostly dark brown with a dab of gray.
   This drama may raise anew the debate over colorization, but it
is one that can be missed with no regrets.

<HEAD>CNN Book Tells All on Turner and Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Edward Turner III, a.k.a. ``Terrible
Ted,'' ``Mouth of the South'' and ``Captain Outrageous,'' is short
on words and long on bravado.
   Even when someone is writing a book about his baby, the Cable
News Network.
   ``Ted's out there,'' said author Hank Whittemore, in what may be
one of the understatements of the decade. ``He's like a brief
tornado in your life.''
   Whittemore has written ``CNN: The Inside Story,'' a 308-page
chronicle of the little network that could. Its release Friday by
Little, Brown &amp; Co., coincides with CNN's 10th birthday.
   Excerpts have appeared in TV Guide. Some of the stories in the
book have been told more times in more journalistic watering holes
than Dan Rather's infamous seven-minute stroll off a live CBS
newscast.
   Take, for example, the time a light bulb exploded in the CNN
Washington bureau and ignited the clothing of on-camera reporter Dan
Schorr. Or the time weatherman Stu Siroka was victimized by the
Chromakey process, which allows one picture to be placed behind
another. All viewers saw was Siroka's bald head, suspended above the
weather map.
   Take Turner, who after agreeing to cooperate with Whittemore,
would walk in to scheduled interviews and say ``Hi, Hank, how much
time you want? I've got about nine minutes.''
   Whittemore spent six months interviewing present and former CNN
movers and shakers. His account tells a spirited and sometimes
bizarre tale of how Turner, equipped with $100 million and even more
chutzpah, screamed, bullied, sued, cajoled and bankrolled his way
into television history by launching the first 24-hour all-news
network.
   On cable.
   And here is Whittemore, the author a best seller called ``The
Super Cops,'' magazine articles and television documentaries, on a
nationwide tour to promote his book and calling from a pay phone in
Washington's National airport.
   Asked to explain Turner, Whittemore pauses. There was an awards
dinner in Kansas City that Whittemore attended recently. ``Now I'm
still working on the book,'' Whittemore recounted, ``and he comes up
to me and says `What are you going to write about me? Just don't
make me out to be an ass.'
   ``Then he looks around and kind of beams, and says `Well, maybe I
was.'
   ``I felt like I was in a Harold Robbins novel,'' Whittemore says,
and laughs.
   ``The man will say the most outrageous things and you wonder `Is
the man just not thinking or is he being very calculating?' ''
   Whittemore talked not only to Turner. He spent hours with Ted
Kavanau, an early CNN executive who became president of Headline
News only to be forced out, and Reese Schonfeld, the network's
founding president, who also left, as well as former anchor Mary
Alice Williams, now with NBC, and several others.
   ``CNN: The Inside Story'' begins in a dilapidated white clapboard
house that was the network's first home and ends in the megalomaniac
structure in Atlanta that now houses the international news agency.
   It copiously notes many weird tales of the upstart network, from
the early days when work crews were literally finishing the set as
anchor Bernard Shaw read the news.
   And the time a cleaning woman, not knowing Shaw was on live,
walked right up to his desk and emptied his trash basket, and the
time a reporter said that ``Mary Ass Williams'' was standing by, and
yet another instance when a correspondent reported that scientists
were trying to grow ``genetically engineered orgasms'' in the
laboratory.
   But gaffes are not the only events noted. Loud and clear,
Whittemore's book comes through with the underlying theme that CNN
made television history by making the Big Three sit up and take
notice.
   And by making CBS, NBC and ABC reluctantly admit they were no
longer the only games in town.
   Round-the-clock news coverage gave CNN a number of firsts:
   President Reagan walking into a Washington, D.C., hospital after
being shot; a split-screen of the hostages being released in Iran as
Reagan was sworn into office, and a lonely cameraman perched atop a
cherry-picker with the only live feed of a nuclear warhead being
removed after an Air Force explosion in Arkansas.
   ``It seems to me that what they want to do is wire the entire
world,'' Whittemore said. ``They want to be totally global, in terms
of sending and receiving signals so that you get what Turner calls
the world talking to itself.''

   Anchorman Dan Rather flies to Prague on Saturday
to help report on events there for CBS' Sunday newscast and
Monday's ``CBS Evening News,'' a spokeswoman said Friday.
   It will be Rather's second trip there since Nov. 13. There was
no word from NBC and ABC on whether their anchors, Tom Brokaw and
Peter Jennings, respectively, also would go to Czechoslovakia to
help cover developments occurring in the wake of massive
pro-democracy demonstrations there. Cable News Network isn't
dispatching an anchor, a spokeswoman said.
   All four networks have correspondents at the scene.
   CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, and Jennings, Rather and Brokaw all are

   The Chinese government halted live American
telecasts from Beijing as troops closed in on hundreds of thousands
of protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   ``In my 20 years of news reporting I've never seen anything like
this,'' CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw said Friday night.
   ``Goodbye from Beijing,'' he said, signing off.
   Correspondents were able to continue reporting by phone.
   Authorities first stopped transmissions from the square, where
videotapes showed soldiers hitting protesters with nightsticks,
then stopped satellite transmissions altogether.
   Networks were reduced to showing maps and photographs of their
correspondents, who said they hadn't been personally threatened. It
was unclear whether the networks would be able to videotape for
later airing.
   The blackout occurred at the end of a week of coverage of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit and the accompanying protests.
   Chinese officials used Gorbachev's departure as justification
for the move.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev China visit is over,'' a Chinese official said
to CNN, translating a written order that had been requested by CNN.
``Now I'm here announcing that CNN should stop the movable earth
station and its transmitting frequencies right away.''
   An official at the Atlanta-based Cable News Network said crew
members were trying to negotiate with the Chinese government for
permission to resume news coverage.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said he did not think the CNN crew
was being ordered out of the country.
   Tapes showed CBS News anchorman Dan Rather preparing for a live
telecast from Tiananmen Square about 8:30 p.m. EDT, only to have
the picture turn to interference.
   Viewers saw the unusual sights of CNN and CBS producers haggling
with Chinese officials in hotel hallways and control centers.
   ``He must do what he must do,'' Rather told an interpreter as an
official stood by outside the Hotel Shangri-La. ``But I want him to
understand that I respectfully protest, as strongly as I can,
particularly since he doesn't have anything in writing to break a
written agreement with.''
   CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said the network had a contract to
broadcast for another 16 or 17 hours. CBS was able to broadcast
from the Hotel Shangri-La for a couple of hours after the Tiananmen
Square blackout.
   ``It's good television and it's good news,'' Dees said. ``We
were prepared to go to Beijing for the summit, and though the
protests were building up, nobody expected it to explode like
this.''
   Bill Baxter of NBC News said the network shared a satellite with
CNN and was unable to get a signal out of China. He said efforts to
book other satellite time were also stymied by the official
blackout.
   ABC had arranged for two satellite feeds Friday night but got
neither of them.
   In a live transmission from the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in
Beijing, CNN showed a government official writing the official
order _ on a note pad provided by CNN editors _ to shut down the
broadcasts.
   The blackout came about an hour after martial law was declared
in parts of Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of
thousands of Chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms.
   CBS special reports interrupted the season finale of ``Dallas.''
The episode was shown delayed but in its entirety.
   ``We've had some calls, but we always get calls during
interrupts,'' Dees said.

   The four major American television networks
showed videotape Monday purportedly of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
hanging from a gallows, though one used only freeze-frames of the
grisly image.
   Cable News Network and CBS showed the video on afternoon
newscasts, while ABC and NBC broadcast still pictures from the
tape. NBC later showed the videotape on ``NBC Nightly News.''
   ``It is not gratuitous violence,'' said Steve Haworth, spokesman
for CNN. He said editors considered, ``Is this stark video
necessary to tell the story? And in fact it is. Everybody came to
the same conclusion.''
   CNN Anchor Ralph Wenge warned viewers the tape was ``very
graphic.''
   On NBC, afternoon viewers of special reports and short ``news
digests'' saw still frames of the man's head and torso.
   ``We felt that the picture we showed captured the essence of
what was claimed to be happening,'' said Donald Browne, executive
director of NBC News.
   Browne said the network showed only still pictures initially
because it had had little time to study the full video and because
viewers do not expect to see something so graphic when regular
programming is interrupted.
   It went ahead with the video in the evening because ``people
expect in a story like that to see graphic material,'' he said.
   The network sent the full tape to affiliates, should they decide
to use more, he said.
   For a special report on ABC during the day, ``There was an
editorial decision not to show the videotape, just the still,''
said spokesman Scott Richardson.
   ABC's evening newscast again only showed still pictures because,
as news anchor Peter Jennings told viewers, the only difference was
that the video ``shows that Col. Higgins was swinging on his
makeshift gallows when the tape was made.''
   ``Our view of showing it is simply based on a gut reaction _ no
need for us to help demean Col. Higgins by watching him swing,'' he
added.

   Once again, Saddam Hussein met with some of the
Western ``guests'' he holds hostage, an Iraqi TV crew in tow.
   And again, Cable News Network aired the Iraqi satellite
transmission live, enabling CNN viewers to watch along with the
Iraqi public.
   So again, a journalistic debate emerged. Should news operations
give Saddam live access to American television?
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, NBC deputy director of news. ``We made that decision the
first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
aired the Iraqi transmission live on Tuesday, as CNN did. Instead,
they showed portions somewhat later.
   CNN said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as
possible.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that CNN understood that Saddam
would be speaking with American hostages. ``There was no question
in our minds this would be newsworthy.''
   CNN explained to viewers that the broadcast was an Iraqi TV
feed. And afterward, CNN featured a debate over the wisdom of the
decisions it had made.
   It's a decision the other networks see differently.
   At NBC, ``we would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first
knowing what it was,'' McFarland said. ``We took every frame of it
into the house, looked at it, and then selected two or three
bites.''
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins, ABC
director of news information. The president of ABC News has to
approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television on Thursday with Western
hostages, ABC joined the Iraqi satellite feed live for a few
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content
of the material.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Tuesday, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report by anchorman Peter Jennings, she said.
   After Tuesday's coverage on CNN, Pati Heath of Detroit, the
sister of an American hostage, called the Atlanta-based network to
say she had seen her brother on TV.
   CNN then put her on television, too.
   ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,'' she
said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.''
   During Tuesday's meeting between Saddam and the hostages _ whom
he calls ``guests'' _ a woman with a British accent was heard
asking Saddam why he was using foreign children ``in something they
can't understand.''
   He responded with a long answer about the threat to his nation
from Western troops. But later Tuesday, the Iraqi News Agency
reported that women and children held in Iraq would be free to go,
and that Saddam had changed his mind because of the concern
expressed by the foreign families during the meeting.
   ``I don't think it's coincidental,'' Haworth said.

   Cable News Network, two days into operation "Desert
Storm," has much the same problem as an Olympic athlete: How
does one turn a gold-medal performance into long-term
success?
   CNN's chilling first-hand accounts as the bombs dropped on
Baghdad Wednesday night provided American officials with a
front-row view of the action from reliable on-the-ground
sources.

   And they were riveting enough to propel CNN, for the first
time, well into the ranks of the Big Three networks in the
ratings race. National ratings to be released today may well
show that CNN beat out the No. 3 network, CBS, in prime-time
ratings for its coverage Wednesday night -- even though CNN
covers only 60% of the country, while CBS, ABC and NBC reach
nearly all homes.
   Maintaining that heady position, however, may be tough.
CNN's early advantage was all but wiped out yesterday, when
the Iraqi government ordered CNN to stop its live broadcasts
from Baghdad. Moreover, other networks and affiliates that
had turned to CNN in the rush of events are now using their
own resources.
   Still, CNN's Jerusalem bureau turned in a strong
performance last night during Iraq's missile assault on
Israel, staying on the air throughout the attack.
   The incidents and ratings illustrate both the triumphs and
continued frustrations experienced by Ted Turner's network.
CNN has established itself as the broadcast wire service: the
network to turn to for the most up-to-date news during
moments of crisis. But it has also had trouble transforming
its journalistic successes into a growing, long-term
viewership.
   The question now: Will CNN be able to hold on to its new
viewers, or will the war simply be another blip on the
ratings screen?
   "The Gulf crisis is a defining event, a chance for the
networks to reshuffle," says S. Robert Lichter, co-director
of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs.
"This is the chance for CNN to become even-up with the Big
Three. If people hear CNN was the place to be at a critical
moment in history, they're going to start watching."
   That will require, however, that CNN continue to "get
scoops out of Baghdad," Mr. Lichter says. The onslaught of
international news -- the fall of the Berlin Wall, strife in
the Soviet Union and now the Persian Gulf -- plays to CNN's
advantage, he adds. "History is conspiring to help CNN."
   The initial results are impressive. A.C. Nielsen Co. data
show that CNN earned the highest ratings in its history
Wednesday. In the prime-time period from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.,
CNN was seen by 19.1% of its 56.8 million cable households.
That amounts to 10.8 million homes, or a national rating of
11.6% of all homes with TV sets. That prime-time rating,
unprecedented in CNN annals, may well eclipse the rating for
CBS when final numbers are tallied today.
   In the 25 top markets of the U.S., accounting for half of
the nation's TV homes, ABC from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Wednesday posted a strong Nielsen rating of 19.5. That marked
a sharp increase from ABC's recent prime-time rating of 12.4%
of the nation's TV homes. NBC drew 15.1% of homes in the top
25 markets. CBS fared less well, being watched by 11.3% of
homes. An equivalent CNN rating in the top 25 markets wasn't
available.
   In cable homes served by CNN, ABC and its affiliates had a
14.4 rating. CBS had a 10.9 rating in those homes, and NBC a
13.8 rating, according to Nielsen data reported by CNN.
   For the 24-hour period from 3 a.m. Tuesday to 3 a.m.
Wednesday, CNN attracted 7.3% of cable homes, or 4.1 million
households, which amounts to a national rating of 4.4% of all
TV homes in the country. Robert Sieber, vice president of
research at CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., says the CNN numbers will go even higher when extra
viewers are tallied from local broadcast stations that picked
up CNN reports instead of airing reports from their
respective ABC, NBC and CBS networks.
   For its part, CNN says it may have made a breakthrough.
"The viewership numbers clearly indicate we have reached a
level in the minds of the cable-viewing public of being there
when major news happens," says Paul Amos, CNN executive vice
president for programming. "I have no doubt this is going to
be a tremendous benefit for us over the long haul."
   Over the past year and a half, network executives have
been trying to reposition CNN into a primary network that
will draw a more loyal following with a regular prime-time
newscast and more investigative coverage. But that effort has
been slow to produce results. The network's average
round-the-clock viewership rating remained at 0.7 in the
first nine months of 1990, identical to the year before.
   Clearly, CNN's international crisis coverage is what still
stands out. Its reporting Wednesday night "must make the
other guys just grind their teeth," says John S. Reidy, a
media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   While the three networks were forced to rely on
correspondents in the U.S., Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia,
CNN was able to keep three reporters on the air from Baghdad.
   Based in the Al-Rashid Hotel, the reporters brought
Americans a series of chilling accounts about how it feels to
be at the center of a targeted city. As 40 or so other
reporters remained cloistered in the hotel basement, Peter
Arnett, John Holliman and Bernard Shaw offered their view
from the ninth floor. They worked by candlelight much of the
night, often diving to the floor when they heard bombing.
   News officials at other networks yesterday were still
trying to figure out how CNN -- and CNN alone -- had the one
working phone link during the first bombing raid.
Less-sophisticated phone hookups for NBC, ABC and CBS were
cut off at about 7 p.m. EST, and it's unclear whether that
resulted from technical problems or Iraqi governmental
action.
   CNN had the advantage of a government-approved four-wire
phone link, which had two lines coming in and two lines going
out. It used a microwave dish that transmitted to Amman,
Jordan, where the phone traffic was then sent via satellite
into the U.S. All three major networks had asked the Iraqi
government for a similar hookup, but they were refused, said
a spokeswoman for NBC.
   News officials said CNN may have won government approval
because of its much higher profile overseas as the news
service of choice for national heads of state. "CNN is
Saddam's link to the outside world," said one news division
executive.
   But jealous rivals wondered whether CNN offered a rumored
quid pro quo to get the phone line. CNN said it obtained
permission from the Iraqi government ahead of time to operate
the line, but denied it had granted any favors to the Iraqis.
"There's been some speculation some sort of deal has been
cut," says CNN's Mr. Amos. "We're not in bed with the
Iraqis."
   The Iraqi Ministry of Information arrived at the hotel and
ordered CNN to terminate its live satellite coverage
yesterday. The reasons were unclear, but one of the CNN
Baghdad reporters suggested that Iraqis heard U.S. officials
say they were gaining military information through the CNN
broadcasts.
   "It would appear based upon the comments that were coming
in from the CNN crew in the hotel in Baghdad that the
operation was successful in striking targets with a high
degree of precision," said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at a
briefing Wednesday night.
   At yesterday morning's Pentagon briefing, Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had a similar
response when asked about hits on civilian sites. "We have
been very sensitive to collateral damage in the Baghdad
areas," he said, "and I think the best source of how careful
we have been is listening to the CNN reporters who were
watching it unfold."
   Wednesday night, ABC and CNN were first to go on the air
with reports that an air attack had been launched, followed
by NBC and then CBS. NBC had its reporter in Baghdad, Tom
Aspell, on the air by phone starting at 6:49 p.m., but the
phone link was lost at 7:05 p.m., about the same time ABC's
line went down.
   After the major networks lost their phone communications,
CNN offered to let them interview CNN anchor Bernard Shaw.
Only NBC's Tom Brokaw took up the request. "It wasn't really
a tough decision. You serve the viewer with timely
information out of Baghdad -- that's where events are
unfolding," an NBC News spokeswoman said. And because CNN
reaches only about 60% of the country's households, she
noted, putting Mr. Shaw on the air on NBC expanded his reach
considerably.
   But now that CNN's phone link has been lost, said a
spokesman for CBS News, "we're all back on the same playing
field." The major networks are hoping to regain an edge over
CNN by trotting out their more experienced correspondents and
analysts.
   ABC News may have the most talent, with Peter Jennings and
"Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel leading the team. CBS has
brought out the venerable likes of Walter Cronkite -- after
he first appeared on CNN Wednesday afternoon -- and Charles
Kuralt and "60 Minutes" co-anchors Ed Bradley and Morley
Safer.

   NEW YORK -- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and countermoves
by U.S. forces have sparked sharply higher ratings for the
three major networks' nightly newscasts -- so much so that
the news ratings may surpass the networks' prime-time
entertainment fare.
   Since the conflict in the Middle East intensified earlier
this week with the deployment of U.S. troops, the combined
ratings -- provided by A.C. Nielsen Co., a unit of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. -- for the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and
NBC are up 15% from the previous two weeks, according to
David F. Poltrack, a CBS Inc. senior vice president.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the trend -- and the conflict -- continues, next week's
combined ratings for the three newscasts may exceed the
ratings of prime-time shows. "If it happens, it would be the
first time," Mr. Poltrack said.
   Individually, the "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" was
up 22% in ratings, "ABC World News Tonight with Peter
Jennings" increased its audience by 16% in ratings, and
ratings for "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw" rose by 8%
from two weeks ago, Mr. Poltrack says.
   The Iraq story also has boosted the ratings of the 24-hour
news channel Cable News Network, owned by Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. CNN nearly doubled its ratings, attracting 1.5%
of all cable homes on Wednesday, the cable channel's highest
24-hour average this year. CNN typically gets a rating of
0.6% of cable homes.
   For the broadcast networks, ratings for the nightly news
aired at 6:30 p.m. or 7 p.m. EDT usually dip in the summer as
viewers go on vacation or stay out later to enjoy the extra
hours of daylight. The three broadcast-network newscasts had
a combined rating of 30.8% of all television homes for the
1988-89 season. But that number dropped 20% in July to a
combined 24.7 rating. A ratings point represents 1% of all
television households or 921,000 homes.
   While the Iraq invasion has been good news for network
news, it could deflate the networks' aggressive programming
strategy used in prime time this summer. Instead of airing
the typical parade of series reruns because of low summer
viewing, the networks have been running more original
episodes in a bid for higher ratings -- yet now their nightly
newscasts could draw even bigger audiences.
   To date, the networks are stymied in efforts to cover the
Middle East story with correspondents and camera crews. CBS
News anchor Dan Rather continues to report from Jordan,
cutting short a vacation in the south of France last week
with "CBS Evening News" executive producer Tom Bettag. Both
men flew to London when Iraq first invaded Kuwait.
   ABC's "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel flew to Cairo, as did
NBC's "Meet the Press" anchor Garrick Utley. Both networks
decided against sending their lead anchors to the Middle East
because officials believed the newsmen were better equipped
to monitor events from New York.

   This weekend, network anchors and correspondents
will go down to the sea in ships _ Soviet and American guided
missile cruisers _ for the summit meeting of President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The warship setting in Malta may be reminiscent of August 1941,
when President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston
Churchill met aboard warships in Newfoundland for a meeting that
produced the Atlantic Charter.
   But now, as then, the Fourth Estate won't need sea legs. As in
1941, the ships involved in a historic meeting aren't far from
land, this time about 1,000 yards offshore in the harbor at
Marsaxloc, on the south coast of Malta.
   This being the age of TV and satellites, those covering and
participating in the shipboard summits on Saturday and Sunday may
be able to see themselves on TV on the ships, the USS Belknap and
the Soviet navy's Slava.
   CNN, whose Washington-based anchor, Bernard Shaw, is among 60
Cable News Network staffers heading to Malta, is hoping to install
on each ship portable facilities to receive CNN's worldwide
newscasts, a spokesman here says.
   ``They're trying hard to set it up,'' he says. ``Obviously that
takes a little more effort, but that's what they're trying to do.''
   Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, the anchors of ABC,
CBS and NBC, respectively, also are making the voyage to Malta, the
point men of a three-network army totalling nearly 200 staffers
from Europe and the United States.
   Each anchor first will report from Rome on the meeting Friday
between Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II before moving on to Malta
and coverage of a summit in which the upheaval in Eastern Europe
may produce major news.
   The White House press center, the networks' command stations and
portable satellite transmission centers on Malta will be in its
capital city, Valletta, a few miles from the harbor in which the
shipboard meetings will occur.
   But Jeff Gralnick, Lane Venardos and Joe Angotti, the executives
in charge of the ABC, CBS and NBC expeditions, respectively, say
they don't expect any problems with getting live video signals from
the ships.
   Although anchoring newscasts from the ships is an unlikely
possibility, they say, they anticipate being able to send live
reports from the ships on their own, separate circuits via
microwave.
   Those transmissions and those of CNN then would be relayed to
Valletta _ where the network evening newscasts will be anchored _
for satellite feeds to the United States.
   ``I don't anticipate any difficulties,'' says Angotti. ``They
are making available to us pretty complete access to getting
pictures microwaved off of each of the ships.
   ``I expect that we'll have as much coverage of this summit as we
would on a land-based summit.''
   Saturday's opening day of talks is to be held aboard the Slava,
with Sunday's session aboard the Belknap. Developments from each
are to be reported live and on videotape as warranted.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to close their summit with a
joint statement, and then hold separate news conferences. The
networks expect to air all three events live, starting at 8 a.m.
EST on Sunday.
   The only big problem that CBS' Venardos says he worries about is
trying to get information when Bush, Gorbachev and their spokesmen
``are isolated on these ships.''
   At such times, he says, ``there's no way to pick up the phone''
and ask for the spokesmen. ``We have to wait until they come off
the ships to find out what happened. And so, the clamor for
information is going to be pretty loud down there, I think.''
   But each side seems eager to have this one of the most
accessible-to-television summits in recent history, he says.
   The networks' shipboard microwave transmission links can be shut
down at any time, Venardos says, but ``both sides have been
extraordinarily interested in having live television available on
this event ... the Russians no less than the Americans.''

   CAN WE TALK BICOASTAL? _ Pleased by the ratings for the ``The

Tribune Entertainment, which syndicates her New York-based weekday
series, is thinking of having it air from Los Angeles for three
months each year. Should this come to pass, says a spokesman for
Rivers' show, it would make her program ``the nation's first
bicoastal talk show in syndication.''

   The Big Three television networks plan election
night coverage in varying degrees of depth, but the Cable News
Network is planning its most intensive coverage of an off-year
election.
   ABC and NBC plan their principal coverage in hour-long news
specials at 10 p.m. EST, followed by local news at 11 p.m.; CBS
plans a two-hour show, from 9 to 11 p.m., and all three plan 11:30
p.m. wrapup reports.
   CNN's main coverage runs from 7 p.m. EST to 1 a.m., when its
90-minute wrapup show begins. Its final wrapup is at 3 a.m. ``This
is the most extensive coverage we've had in an off year,'' said CNN
spokeswoman Melinda McIntire.
   As they did in the last off-year elections in 1986, NBC and ABC
are leading into full-time coverage with prime time shows; CBS, the
only network that filled all of prime time with its coverage in
'86, has cut back an hour.
   This year, CBS pre-empts its ``Tuesday Night Movie,'' while NBC
and ABC, respectively, pre-empt ``Law and Order'' and
``thirtysomething.''
   Cliff Kappler, NBC's senior producer of news specials, said
technology has cut the time networks must devote to elections. ``I
think it compares favorably to the amount of ground that we cover,
but we will do it in an infinitely quicker time,'' he said.
   This is the first year that all four networks pool resources for
exit polling and winner projections, in a $12 million joint venture
called Voter Research and Surveys, or VRS.
   VRS gives each network polls and projections for all Senate,
House and governor's races, and state and local races of national
interest, such as the Washington, D.C., mayor's race and
California's propositions.
   The exit polls ``provide demographic profiles of each
candidate's constituents and the role of issues, such as abortion
and President Bush's performance, in shaping voters' choice for
office,'' CBS said.
   ABC has scheduled two special reports of between three and five
minutes by David Brinkley between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST, when the
network opens its main coverage anchored by Peter Jennings.
   NBC News offers brief reports between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST.
Then, at 10 p.m., Tom Brokaw will anchor ``Decision '90,'' with
analysis by John Chancellor.
   NBC will provide analysis of the elections with Ron Brown,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Ed Rollins,
co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
   CBS' special coverage, anchored by Dan Rather in New York City,
opens at 8 p.m. EST with a seven-minute report. From 9 p.m. to 11
p.m., CBS offers its ``Campaign '90: Election Night.''
   Serious election night junkies will tune into CNN, which opens
its coverage at 6:30 p.m. EST with its principal Washington anchor,
Bernard Shaw, for an election night preview edition of ``The World
Today.''
   The main coverage begins at 7 p.m.
   CNN's political commentators will include analyst Frederick
Allen, political columnist William Schneider of the Los Angeles
Times, and Patrick Buchanan, Michael Kinsley, Robert Novak and Mark
Shields.

<TEXT>     "Essentially, he's a very shy man," Ed Turner, CNN's vice president for
news, says of Shaw. "There are very few humorous anecdotes about Bernie
because he's such a serious fellow at what he does.";    One old friend,
George Watson, says Shaw always had an unshakable faith in himself. Watson
hired Shaw at ABC News; Watson then moved to CNN, where he lured Shaw again in
early 1980. At the time, the cable network was still a twinkle in Ted Turner's
eye.;    "Bernie is a little rigid," says Watson, now back at ABC as
Washington bureau chief. "He is impatient when things don't go right. The
Marines were a formative experience for Bernie.";    Shaw grew up in Chicago,
the son of a house painter and a domestic. As a teen-ager, he would make
announcements on the school public address system, sneak into news conferences
and call reporters to discuss their craft.;    "A sense of pride was deeply
ingrained in him, that his family had standards to live up to and he didn't
have time to waste on clowning or horseplay," says Thelma Ford, who taught
English at Dunbar Vocational High School, a predominantly black school.
"Bernie had within him this capacity for talking, for conveying ideas.";
The man who has become the nation's most prominent black anchor says he faced
no special obstacles as a youth. "I didn't need any black role models," he
says. "I didn't look at Edward R. Murrow as white. He was the premier example
of excellence. . . . I would work harder than the average person regardless of
my color.";    Says Ed Turner: "I sense more of a pride in being a Marine than
being black. It simply doesn't enter into his thinking or conversation.";
Shaw never saw combat in the Marines -- the closest he came was when his unit
went steaming toward the China Sea during the 1962 crisis in Laos. While he
was stationed in Hawaii, however, he made a connection that would provide him
with solid career advice.;    Didn't give up;    In 1961, when CBS anchor
Walter Cronkite was passing through Hawaii, he found himself deluged with
messages from a "Corporal Shaw." The young Marine finally grabbed Cronkite in
a hotel lobby.;    "He was the most persistent guy I've ever met in my life,"
Cronkite says. "I was going to give him five begrudging minutes and ended up
talking to him for a half hour. He was just determined to be a journalist.";
 A decade later, after Shaw had graduated from the University of Illinois and
paid his dues as a radio reporter covering shootings and riots, Cronkite
helped him land a job with CBS.;    Later, Shaw jumped to ABC, which made him
Latin America bureau chief. He got the only aerial pictures of the Jonestown
massacre by ordering his pilot to fly low over the jungles of Guyana -- so low
that a stall would have meant certain death. When he got back, Shaw told his
colleague Frank Reynolds that he had been lucky to get the story.;    "He
said, 'You always have luck when you hustle.' I've never forgotten that," Shaw
says.;    Wife influenced decision;    In 1980, Shaw hesitated when he was
offered an anchor job at "a network that didn't exist," a 24-hour news channel
that many saw as a harebrained scheme. Shaw says his wife, Linda, persuaded
him to do it by saying that "if you don't and CNN takes off, I won't be able
to live with you.";    CNN made strides in credibility and recognition, but
slowly. It was considered a breakthrough in 1987 when Shaw was included with
CBS' Dan Rather, NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings in a group
interview with President Reagan.;    Shaw's reputation as a fierce inquisitor
gathered steam when he interviewed vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle during
the 1988 Republican convention. The CNN anchor asked if Quayle had joined the
National Guard out of fear of being killed in Vietnam. "Sweat popped out on
his lip," Shaw says. "He was visibly furious.";    Crucial question;    On
Oct. 13, 1988, Shaw asked the question many believe changed the course of the
presidential race. As moderator of the second campaign debate, he opened the
proceedings by asking Michael Dukakis whether he would drop his opposition to
the death penalty if his wife were raped and killed. Dukakis responded with a
limp defense of his opposition to capital punishment and never recovered.;
During the pre-debate discussions, George Watson says, "This was not the
question some other panelists wanted to open up with and they put a lot of
pressure on Bernie. But Bernie stuck to his guns. He's very stubborn.";
Shaw makes no apology for such questions: "I'm not an offensive person by
nature, but if a news-maker is offended while I'm in the process of doing my
job, it does not bother me at all.";    When Shaw is on the other side of the
microphone, however, he is clearly reticent about discussing his private life.
Pressed about his reunion with Linda after he returned from Baghdad, he says
in a monotone: "When the door opened, she just started trembling and crying,
and I started crying too. We all hugged and kissed. . . . She didn't like the
idea of my going. It's difficult what we do to our family members because
we're in this business."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Jennings Missed China, But Will Take `World News' to Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's Peter Jennings was longing to be in China
last week like competitor Dan Rather of CBS, but he's looking ahead
now to taking ``World News Tonight'' to Europe next week, and
anchoring a prime-time news special on Thursday to set it all up.
   Jennings will report from Brussels and London from May 29 to
June 2 as President Bush meets with leaders of NATO allies. Unless
something unusual happens, though, the story in Western Europe
won't be as exciting as the one that CBS' Rather found himself in
the middle of last week.
   Rather and CNN's Bernard Shaw were the only U.S. network anchors
in Beijing. ABC and NBC had correspondents on the scene, but
Jennings and Tom Brokaw were in New York.
   ``Obviously, I mean, God, I mean, it would have been wonderful
to have been there,'' Jennings said in a telephone interview
Monday. ``... They'd-a had a hard time dragging me back.''
   CBS got calls of complaint after Rather and crew interrupted the
season finale of ``Dallas'' with live coverage of negotiations with
Chinese officials who had been sent to pull the plug on CBS'
satellite transmissions.
   ``Dallas'' fans aside, it was a public relations coup for CBS
News. And for news junkies, the live scenes from Beijing were
infinitely more fascinating than any cliffhanger on a night-time
soap.
   CBS News, however, had not known it would land such a big story,
and in fact had gambled that events in, say, Panama, would not
overshadow the real reason for the China trip, the four-day visit
to China by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev came and
went, Panama stayed put, and the student protests in Beijing became
THE story.
   But the recent movements toward democracy in both the Soviet
Union and in China have potentially profound implications for the
United States' relationship with NATO. On Thursday night, Jennings
will anchor a prime-time special on the subject, ``Beyond the Cold
War: The Risk and the Opportunity,'' that will include an interview
with Secretary of State James Baker III.
   ``I hate missing a big story, but we're about to go on to
witness the president attempting to deal with a tumult which has
far wider-ranging effects than what's been happening in China,''
said Jennings.
   ``We were sort of thinking this morning, how long could China go
on having internal revolution before it would have a profound
effect on the United States, and the answer is, a long time.''
   Jennings said he agreed with ABC's decision not to send him to
Beijing. But in retrospect. ...
   ``We know on a big event our audience expects us to go to
them,'' he said. ``This is in some respects why we felt badly last
week. I don't think we were as frustrated last week as we could
have been. Because sometimes you just luck out, and there's no way,
it's like _ I'll tell you a really clean beat was when Brokaw went
to Soviet Armenia. I thought that was a clear beat. ... That's
different from lucking into a story.
   ``I thought my boss (ABC News President Roone Arledge) was
perfectly legitimate in saying, listen, the Soviet-Chinese
rapprochement is not a major story for Americans. It's a major
story, but it certainly wasn't worth going over there for the
broadcast.
   ``But I didn't think that last week.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   CAPITALISM AT WORK _ While the drama in Beijing was unfolding on
Friday _ student demonstrators tensely awaiting possible action by
government troops _ CNN and NBC bickered over CNN's contention that
NBC swiped 20 seconds of live satellite pictures during a morning
news update. CNN President Burt Reinhardt zipped off a telegram of
protest to NBC News President Michael Gartner. NBC said it was all
a misunderstanding. NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said NBC had
experienced a problem with its transmitter and thought it had
arranged to share the cable network's transmission during the live
update, anchored in New York by Deborah Norville. ``There seems to
be a professional courtesy in these things where we help each other
out. Anything beyond that was a misunderstanding,'' she said,
adding that if there was a misunderstanding, NBC would apologize. .

   SHHH, HORSE RACE IN PROGRESS _ ``CBS Sunday Morning'' host
Charles Kuralt reported Sunday on the Preakness win by Sunday
Silence, ``a horse that has been adopted by this program, which
believes in a certain amount of silence on Sunday.'' He then showed

   The major television networks have moved to
Moscow for a superpower summit that may end up producing more pomp
than news.
   President Reagan arrived early Thursday in Finland for a
four-day stopover en route to the Soviet Union. He arrives in
Moscow on Sunday for his fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan and Gorbachev had hoped to use the summit to sign a
treaty reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons, but
negotiations over the pact have stalled over the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative _ Star Wars _ and verification issues.
   ``It's clear both sides are prepared to accentuate the positive,
orchestrate the ceremonial side of the summit,'' said CBS anchor
Dan Rather. ``I think there'll be a lot of smiles, a lot of toasts
and a lot of talk about promise in the future and great beginnings.
   ``But one of the jobs of a reporter is to separate bullshine
from brass tacks. Unless something changes, it's going to be more
of the former and less of the latter.
   ``But the ceremonial stuff, it'll be terrific,'' he said. ``The
Russians are pretty good at great ceremony.''
   This will be the first visit by the 77-year-old Reagan to the
country he once called an evil empire, and it's the first visit of
an American president to the Soviet Union in 14 years.
   CBS started its pre-summit coverage Wednesday night with Rather
anchoring the ``CBS Evening News'' from Moscow. Features will
include a series of ``On the Road'' segments by correspondent
Charles Kuralt on the Transiberian Express. While Rather is in
Moscow, Bob Schieffer will hold down the fort in New York. ``He's
hoping news breaks out somewhere else,'' joked Rather.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' with Peter Jennings also began
broadcasting from Moscow on Wednesday.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw will originate from Moscow
beginning Monday. All the nightly newscasts will come from Moscow
through Wednesday, then move for the last two nights of the week to
London to assess European response to the superpower summit.
   PBS' Robert MacNeil, co-anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' will report from Moscow each night of the summit through
June 2. Jim Lehrer will anchor in Washington.
   CNN's senior Washington anchor Bernard Shaw will anchor coverage
from Moscow with frequent live updates and coverage of arrivals,
departures, major remarks, speeches and photo opportunities.
   For cable viewers who want to see the Soviet angle on the story,
The Discovery Channel plans to air the hour-long Soviet news show
``Vremya'' each night of the summit at 9 p.m. EDT.
   ABC, NBC and CNN plan to have live coverage of Reagan's arrival
in Moscow on Sunday beginning at 6 a.m. EDT. ``CBS Sunday Morning''
will have a report on the arrival at 9 a.m. EDT.
   NBC's ``Sunday Today'' with Garrick Utley and Maria Shriver will
also originate from Moscow on Sunday. NBC will have a special
one-hour ``Meet the Press'' Sunday with Chris Wallace, Tom Brokaw
and John Chancellor. ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' will
feature an interview with National Security advisor Colin Powell in
a 90-minute special.
   All the weekday morning shows will have one co-anchor in Moscow
_ Bryant Gumbel for NBC's ``Today,'' Charles Gibson for ``Good
Morning America'' on ABC and Kathleen Sullivan for ``CBS This
Morning.''
   NBC additionally plans five-minute updates daily at noon during
the summit, and ABC says it plans occasional cut-ins during the day
for live coverage of significant remarks or news conferences.
   ABC's ``Nightline'' plans to link up with a Soviet news show one
night of the summit.

   CBS is blitzing the other networks' coverage of
Emperor Hirohito's funeral and President Bush's trip to the Far East
this week, taking most of its news broadcasts to Japan at a cost of
at least $2 million.
   ABC, NBC and CNN also will be on location for Hirohito's funeral.
Bush will attend the funeral Thursday in Tokyo, then he goes to
China and Korea.
   At a news conference last week, ``Evening News'' anchor Dan
Rather called the coverage ``unprecedented'' by broadcast news, but
warranted by Hirohito's death as a symbol of ``the end of the
postwar era.''
   ABC's Peter Jennings will anchor ``ABC World News Tonight'' from
Tokyo all week. NBC's Tom Brokaw will anchor ``NBC Nightly News''
from Tokyo on Thursday and Friday, then from Beijing on Saturday and
Sunday. CNN's Bernard Shaw and Mary Alice Williams will anchor live
coverage of the funeral from Tokyo.
   The networks have all focused on Japan's culture and economy in
reports leading up to the funeral and Bush's trip.
   CBS, which began on-location coverage Sunday with ``CBS Sunday
Morning,'' also is taking the ``CBS Evening News,'' ``CBS This
Morning,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``Face the Nation'' to Japan. The
coverage concludes next Sunday with ``Face the Nation'' from Beijing.
   The broadcasts will focus on Japan's relationship to the United
States in terms of economy, lifestyles and military interdependence.
   CBS' ``48 Hours'' will have live coverage of the beginning of the
funeral Thursday night, when it will be Friday morning in Japan.
   CBS News figures it will have 18 hours of special coverage from
the Far East at a cost of at least $2 million, Rather said.
   ``We thought long and hard about whether should make this kind of
commitment to this story at this time,'' he said. ``This is a gamble
for us.''
   ``But we think in this particular case we can make it work,'' he
said.

   NEW YORK -- Cable News Network typically reaches only 60%
of the nation's homes. But as allied jets struck Iraq last
CNN widened its audience by untold millions by getting help
from unlikely partners: stations affiliated with the three
major broadcast networks.
   There are 130 stations affiliated with the ABC, CBS and
NBC networks that are also affiliated with CNN, a unit of
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. And, to the
chagrin of network news division officials, many of these
stations pre-empted the major networks in favor of CNN's
coverage of the war in the Persian Gulf.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm doing it right now," Bob Campbell, news director of
WHTR, the NBC affiliate in Indianapolis said yesterday
afternoon after a Iraqi Scud missile attack over Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia. "NBC just doesn't have the pictures. What we're
trying to do is get the freshest news and pictures and many
times, it's CNN that has both."
   Indeed, local news directors interviewed yesterday said
they switched away from their network's coverage to CNN
because the 11-year-old upstart service was faster at getting
breaking news on the air than the more-established networks.
   Neither Turner officials nor the ratings service supplied
by the A.C. Nielsen Co. had exact figures of how many network
affiliates switched to CNN or how many viewers this added to
CNN's record-setting audience.
   A spokeswoman for ABC News said that any affiliate that
pre-empts its coverage "risks losing the right to cover ABC
News programming. . . . We feel (a pre-emption) is
inappropriate." Anthony C. Malara, president of CBS affiliate
relations, said in an interview that "a network can't just
sit around and say this is normal procedure." He said he was
investigating which affiliates pre-empted and for how long.
An NBC News spokeswoman declined comment.
   Stations affiliated with the major networks, particularly
with NBC, a unit of General Electric, had similarly done this
in October 1989 during the San Francisco earthquake. NBC was
criticized by its affiliates for slowness in responding to
the breaking story. Last week, the initial scoop of having
CNN anchor Bernard Shaw and correspondents Peter Arnett and
John Holliman file dramatic live coverage from Baghdad on the
first night of the war, pushed the pre-emptions to
unprecedented levels.
   CNN also has 84 independent stations in addition to 32
affiliated with Capital Cities/ABC Inc., 45 affiliated with
CBS Inc. and 53 with National Broadcasting Co. In fact, at
least one network-owned station, WTVJ, the NBC-owned station
in Miami, pre-empted NBC on Wednesday night.
   At times, television screens looked like a CNN-dominated
show. In Atlanta, for instance, the three network affiliates
dropped network coverage in favor of CNN, and two independent
stations beamed to Atlanta cable systems showed CNN.
   "It's nice," Ed Turner, CNN executive vice-president,
said.
   Jim Overbay, news director of KCTV, CBS's television
affiliate in Kansas City, said that several times during the
coverage "CBS wasn't in a competitive advantage to deliver
pictures when we needed them."
   Network officials stressed that the local stations
pre-empted their coverage for only minutes at a time. But Mr.
Overbay said his station dropped out of CBS News coverage for
periods of 20 minutes each.
   In the mid-1980's, network news divisions expanded
overnight and early morning programming to blunt affiliate
defection during those hours. However, because of severe
budget cuts, each network subsequently significantly reduced
such programming.
   There are signs the networks now may have to rethink their
strategies. NBC News, for instance, this month began an
overnight affiliate news service, but it only provides
footage, as opposed to taped reports with NBC News
correspondents. ABC News had planned a Washington-based
overnight newscast, but shelved it when the advertising
market crashed. And CBS News is exploring the possibility of
a new format for its two-hour overnight program "Nightwatch."
   John Culliton, news director of the CBS affiliate in
Minneapolis, which is considered to have one of the strongest
local news divisions in the country, said he didn't expect
CBS would be upset by his decision last week to pre-empt the
network and anchor Dan Rather several times. "They're
professionals," he said, "and I hope they understand that our
goal at that time is not so much loyalty to the network, but
to serving the viewers."

   When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago, Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing.
"They said, `follow CNN,'" he told reporters.

   That shows how far Ted Turner's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago, when it was considered the laughingstock of television news.
It is bigger, faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks.
Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world.

   But for all its success, CNN has hit a plateau.
Although viewership soars when big news breaks, it ebbs during periods of calm.
CNN executives worry that the network's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and won't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV.

   "Just the fact we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin," says Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president, news gathering (and no relation to Ted Turner).
"You can't live on that."

   So CNN, a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel, or what people in the television industry call a "top of mind" network.
Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts.
The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier, a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism.

   The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length "signature" programming with recognizable stars.
To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program.
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers.
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team.

   "The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables," says Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News, CNN's sister network.

   But that won't be easy.
Networks, like other consumer products, develop images in peoples' minds that aren't easy to change.
It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see.
And the cable-TV operators -- CNN's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are.

   The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive.
Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co.'s Consumer News and Business Channel, both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future.
In addition, many cable-TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations.

   CNN wants to change its viewers' habits.
Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research.
That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks.
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels.

   CNN's viewer habits have been molded by its format.
Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service.
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks.
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called "Daybreak," "Daywatch," "Newsday," and "Newsnight," but the shows varied little in content, personality or look.

   Now, the push is on for more-distinctive shows.
"Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity," says Paul Amos, CNN executive vice president for programming.

   Accordingly, CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most "differentiated" programs in viewers' minds, says Mr. Amos.
And it is exploring other original programs, similar to its "Larry King Live" and "Crossfire" talk shows, which executives hope will keep people tuned in.

   Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier.
Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period.
But 70% of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in.
Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.

   Some in the industry are skeptical.
"I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says Reuven Frank, the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report.

   The evening news is also slated as CNN's stage for its big push into investigative journalism.
In August, the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC.
She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly, in-depth segments, with an eye toward breaking big stories.
CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way "60 Minutes" did so well for CBS.

   That's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces.
"They've never shown any inclination to spend money on production," says Michael Mosettig, a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job.

   The network's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards, resulting in a less-experienced work force.
CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15%, but they're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks.
Says Mr. Mosettig: "CNN is my wire service; they're on top of everything.
But to improve, they've really got to make the investment in people."

   In any case, cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN's format.
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage.
"We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest, long-format programming," says Robert Stengel, senior vice president, programming, of Continental Cablevision Inc., which holds a 2% stake in Turner Broadcasting.

   Televison networks all sent dozens of
staffers to cover the Northern California earthquake, but sheer
numbers couldn't always overcome the enormous difficulties the
story presented.
   Even with million-dollar anchors and squadrons of
correspondents, technicians and producers, the three broadcast
networks and CNN quickly learned it's a grind to deliver
compelling, competitive reports in conditions where rumor and
misinformation have flowed like water.
   ABC anchor Peter Jennings arrived at destroyed Interstate 880 on
Wednesday morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch
that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly
and accurately.
   Jennings said rescue workers had labored through the night to
save lives on the collapsed freeway. Anyone who had spent the
early-morning hours there would have said very little happened
after midnight.
   In one of his initial news bulletins Tuesday night from New
York, CBS' Dan Rather played it safe. Not wanting to speculate on
information he didn't have, Rather read major earthquake figures
from an almanac.
   John Carman, the television critic for the San Francisco
Chronicle, said quake coverage by CNN was sometimes as inexact as
it was instant (CNN was on the air six minutes after the quake hit).
   Carman noted that CNN anchors Molly McCoy and Bob Cain were
unfamiliar with such things as local geography and area codes.
   CBS News has heard some complaints, too. ``We've been criticized
from both ends _ for being too cautious and then I had a call that
we're doing too much coverage,'' said spokeswoman Donna Dees.
   After overcoming various initial jitters, all four networks were
praised by TV critics for steady, informative broadcasts. Ratings
were strong, too.
   The three broadcast network newscasts originated Wednesday night
from the earthquake zone, as Jennings was joined in town by Rather
and NBC's Tom Brokaw. CNN sent Atlanta anchor Lou Waters and 25
correspondents. The networks also broadcast prime-time specials on
the disaster.
   In addition, NBC's ``Today'' show was anchored in San Francisco
and CBS' ``48 Hours'' and ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' planned
broadcasts on the quake for Thursday night. NBC News President
Michael Gartner said his network had 60 staffers in the city.
   Andrew Heyward, the executive producer of ``48 Hours,'' said
Thursday the arrival of the network stars testified to the story's
importance. ``There is an advantage for the anchor to be in the
city _ it's certainly better than in the studio,'' Heyward said.
   Indeed, national interest in the TV accounts and mesmerizing
footage has been profound. Preliminary ratings for the ABC, CBS and
NBC specials Wednesday night indicated nearly half of all homes
with television tuned in.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates, ABC's special, ``The
Great Quake of '89,'' was the highest-rated of the broadcasts,
averaging a 13.2 rating.
   NBC's special, ``Earthquake Aftershock,'' directly competing
with ABC's program at 10 p.m. EDT, was second with a 12.2 rating. A
``CBS Reports'' special, ``The Califoria Earthquake,'' which aired
an hour earlier, averaged an 11.9 rating.
   Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   CNN set an all-time viewership record Tuesday night, when more
than 3.6 million homes watched the news network, CNN spokesman
Anthony Masterson said.
   ``The great difficulties are imposed by the loss of power,
traffic jams and obstacles created by the story itself,'' said CNN
Executive Vice President Ed Turner. ``Once you have that
established, the unfolding of the story is not that difficult.''
   Journalistic standards can crumble when dealing with a disaster
such as the San Francisco earthquake, Turner said. ``The greatest
trap is to pass on bad information _ and there's a lot of it out
there _ or create an alarmist atmosphere and scare people. You have
to be judicious in your demeanor.''
   While many are transfixed by the television images, not all are
pleased. Viewers of CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis flooded the
switchboard when Tuesday earthquake coverage first interrupted a TV
movie on acquaintance rape.

<TEXT>     In the earliest stages of this war, when the fighting was carried on by
such inhuman elements as "smart bombs," the three became our most visible
heroes and only direct contact with what was happening in the Iraqi capital.;
  But at 11 a.m. EST Thursday, communication with the correspondents and the
rest of their eight-person team was cut off by the Iraqis. By late afternoon,
Cable News Network didn't know where they were. The CNN team had been
preparing to leave the city when the first bombs fell early Thursday morning.
Shaw had been in Baghdad for several days hoping for an interview with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein that he didn't get.;    Then suddenly Thursday night,
the correspondents were back on the air -- but very briefly. Holliman, in a
report he said was censored by the Iraqis, said he and his colleagues were
fine, things were quiet and that was about it.;    Friday morning, a CNN
spokesman said Arnett and two members of the CNN team remained in Baghdad,
while Holliman, Shaw and other journalists had departed for Jordan.;    It
wasn't the first time Arnett had been trapped behind enemy lines.;    Arnett,
who earned a Pulitzer Prize for his compelling firsthand reports of American
involvement in Vietnam, was caught in Saigon when it fell in 1975, his 13th
year of covering the war for the Associated Press. He joined CNN in 1981.;
Shaw is the no-nonsense anchor, winner of a Peabody Award. He traveled to
Baghdad in September for an exclusive interview with Saddam.;    Holliman is
more the Everyman. Although professional as a newscaster -- he also has won a
Peabody -- he brings a sort of down-home curiosity to goings-on that made the
first moments of the war particularly real.;    It was Holliman who coolly
held a microphone on the window ledge in Baghdad to let the world hear the
war.;    Then there's Shaw. Shaw, 49, began his journalism career in Chicago
radio in 1964. He later moved to Washington and joined CBS in 1971. Before
joining the newly started CNN in 1980, he was at ABC, where he was the senior
Capitol Hill correspondent.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>``CBS Evening News'' Third in Ratings by Narrow Margin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once-dominant ``CBS Evening News,'' now
trailing ABC's ``World News Tonight'' in ratings, was third last
week, national audience estimates showed Tuesday.
   ABC's newscast, anchored by Peter Jennings, easily won the week
ending Jan. 14 with a ratings average of 11.9. It was the 12th time
this season the program has triumphed over CBS's newscast,
according to an ABC spokesman.
   Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News,'' which usually is in third
place, was second in ratings last week with a 10.9 average, edging
out Rather's newscast, which was third by a narrow margin of
one-tenth of a ratings point.
   Acording to the A.C. Nielsen Co., each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.
   CBS officials had no immediate explanation for Rather's
third-place finish, which last happened in the final week of
December, according to CBS.
   Last week, one major CBS affiliate, KPIX-TV in San Francisco,
shifted Rather's program to an earlier 5:30 p.m. PST start time.
   But it isn't known yet if that was a factor in the week's
Nielsen returns for the program, said Michael Eisenberg, CBS vice
president for audience measurement.
   ``We couldn't point to that as the only reason right now,'' he
said in an interview Tuesday. ``We're studying the matter and
trying to find out what the reasons are.''
   In a news conference in Los Angeles over the weekend, Rather
said, ``I intend to keep right on keeping on. It's true, the `CBS
Evening News' is a work in progress ... we're constantly trying to
improve.''
   Asked about his delivery of the news from a standing position,
the anchorman said, ``I've always wanted to stand and do the
broadcast. I don't think that's cosmetic.''
   Rather and CBS News President David Burke said they were unable
to explain the ratings tumble.
   But each discounted speculation that some of it was due to
Rather's much-publicized on-air confrontation with then GOP
presidential candidate George Bush during a ``CBS Evening News''
interview in early 1988.
   Burke blamed part of the program's ratings slide on what he
called statistical errors in the Nielsen ratings system and on the
programs of other broadcast outlets such as the 24-hour Cable News
Network.
   ``There is increasing competition from CNN, which means you
don't have to make an appointment to watch the news anymore, you
have it on all the time, and I think they do a fine job,'' Burke
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Journalists Travel to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. journalists left aboard an Air Force
cargo plane Aug. 12 for Saudi Arabia to join American troops.
   Before leaving the United States, they were briefed by Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central Command, at
MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla.
   Journalists had protested to the Pentagon that U.S. troops
arrived in Saudi Arabia without American reporters allowed into the
country to cover their activities. Defense Department officials had
promised to work on the matter.
   Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, then moved toward that country's
border with Saudi Arabia. On Aug. 7, the United States dispatched
troops to Saudi Arabia to defend the oil-rich kingdom against a
possible Iraqi incursion. But no pool of American news reporters
was organized to accompany the American forces to view the
situation first-hand.
   U.S. officials said Saudi officials established the ground rules
that kept U.S. journalists out of the kingdom.
   When U.S. forces invaded Panama last December, a small group of
American journalists accompanied the troops. The reporters were
selected in advance by their employers and pledged to keep their
movement secret to protect the security of the military operation.
   But journalists complained that the Pentagon pool did not work
in Panama, where reporters were kept away from the action.
   The arrangement was set up after the U.S. invasion of Grenada,
when journalists were kept away from the Caribbean nation entirely.
   Journalists from The Associated Press, Reuters, United Press
International, Scripps-Howard News Service, Cable News Network,
National Public Radio, the Milwaukee Journal, the Los Angeles Times
and Time Magazine are in the pool.

<HEAD>Middle East Crisis Boosts Network News Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public interest in the Middle East crisis
boosted the ratings for the three network evening news shows by 15
percent Aug. 6 through Aug. 8, a CBS research executive said.
   The 24-hour Cable News Network also said its coverage has
boosted ratings, with the highest daily average recorded on Aug. 8
_ a 1.5 rating that represents 831,000 homes. It was more than
double CNN's audience this quarter.
   That rating, based on Nielsen audience estimates, was CNN's
highest since its coverage of the U.S. invasion of Panama last
December, said CNN spokesman John Bianchi.
   ``The American public is definitely interested in the (Middle
East) story,'' said David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president for
research, citing preliminary overnight ratings from 24 major cities.
   ``CBS Evening News'' had the biggest increase, up 22 percent in
overnight ratings compared with those for the same three-day period
in the preceding two weeks, he said.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' were up 16
percent and 8 percent, respectively, he said.
   ``It's conceivable that the three network news ratings will
beat'' those of this week's prime-time programs when the week's
national ratings are averaged out, ``and based on these numbers it
should,'' he said.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who cut short a vacation in France
when Iraq invaded Kuwait, has been among CBS overseas staffers
reporting the story, with Rather working from Jordan.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw and his ABC counterpart, Peter Jennings, have
remained in New York to anchor their evening newscasts, but ABC
``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel flew to Cairo to broadcast from
there Aug. 9.
   Garrick Utley, co-anchorman of NBC's ``Sunday Today,'' went to
Cairo to co-anchor the program from there Aug. 12.

<HEAD>Iraq Jamming Voice of America, BBC Broadcasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voice of America and the BBC increased their
Arabic-language broadcasts after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and
Iraq began jamming both services.
   The broadcasts have been heavy on news about the invasion and
international efforts to punish President Saddam Hussein.
   The U.S. service was trying to bypass the interruption by
beaming its programs to Iraq through satellite television
broadcasts. VOA Deputy Director Robert Coonrod said Iraqis can tune
in if they have a satellite dish or access to one through a local
TV station.
   Satellite transmissions, too, can be jammed. But experts say
Iraq would need to jam the entire Indian Ocean satellite in order
to block VOA.
   The English-language programs of the VOA and BBC have not been
blocked, Coonrod said Aug. 7.
   VOA increased the number of hours it broadcasts in Arabic to the
Middle East from 7{ daily to nearly 10, and replaced music programs
with more news.
   The BBC expanded its Arabic-language broadcasts from nine to 10{
hours.
   ``Jamming the BBC is always the last resort of those who wish to
suppress the truth _ and in a way it is a tribute to the role of
the World Service at times of crisis,'' said David Witherow, deputy
managing director of the BBC World Service.
   ``Jamming is never entirely effective and I am sure that
listeners throughout the region are relying on the BBC for news,''
he said.

<LEADPARA>  BERNARD Shaw, the CNN news anchor who may be the No. 1 TV news "star" of the
week-old gulf war, hates all the media attention he's getting and thinks it's
"a curse.";    Ironically, Shaw said so Wednesday during a two-hour telephone
press conference with dozens of reporters, arranged by CNN to take advantage
of all the media attention.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even though he'd rather go hide somewhere, Shaw reluctantly concedes it's
"part of the job"; so he's striking while the iron is hot. He's doing the
publicity until it hurts. And when he's done, said Shaw, he'll look over all
the book deals, job offers and other proposals and decide which ones to take,
hopefully without screwing up his life.;    "I refuse to allow this boomlet of
publicity and attention to overwhelm me, my family or my job," he said. "I am
going to remain a normal human being.";    Like it or not, though, Shaw
probably isn't going to be a normal human being from now on. Overnight, he
moved up to superstar status in the news business in the minds of millions of
viewers who remained glued to their sets last week to hear his reports from
Baghdad, where he was trapped in Room 906 of the Al-Rashid Hotel with fellow
CNN reporters John Holliman and Peter Arnett during the first Allied air raids
on the Iraqi capital.;    Shaw's experience isn't unique. Major news events
that seize the nation's full attention can make stars of the TV reporters who
cover them exceptionally well. It happened, for instance, to Shaw's CBS
counterpart, Dan Rather, who became a news star after being stranded on
Galveston Island during Hurricane Carla and sending out exclusive reports for
three hectic days.;    For that matter, Shaw's idol, the late Edward R.
Murrow, became the reigning presence at CBS News after filing memorable radio
reports from the London blitzes of World War II.;    So far, the Gulf War has
provided great opportunities for promising network news personalities to take
a big step up -- NBC's Faith Daniels and Katherine Couric have been
particularly impressive in their war assignments -- and has pushed many lesser
known correspondents to the forefront, among them CBS's Scott Pelley and Allen
Pizzey, NBC's Arthur Kent and CNN's Charles Jaco.;    But the most intense
attention has fallen on the three CNN correspondents who became the only U.S.
voices from Baghdad during the first three days of the war: Arnett, Holliman
and Shaw.;    Back in Baghdad;    Arnett, a veteran war correspondent who won
a Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam coverage, remains in Baghdad, reporting under
heavy Iraqi censorship. (He came under White House fire Wednesday for echoing
the Iraqi government line in a report about an air strike.);    Holliman, who
returned with Shaw over the weekend and took part in Wednesday's press
conference, is grateful for the positive publicity, but has no illusions about
becoming a big-money news star and intends to remain at CNN.;    "I've had a
couple of offers," he said. "But I don't think I'm going to be changed by
this. My wife says I'm still the same goofy, fat, balding guy I was when I
left.";    But, of them all, Shaw is in the best position to take advantage of
his sudden celebrity. At 49, he's a 27-year news veteran and holds the top
on-air job at CNN already. At the very least, he's now likely to gain the
parity with the broadcast anchors -- ABC's Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw
and CBS' Rather -- that he's been denied because he's on a young, upstart
network.;    Shaw insists he's doing nothing to use his gulf war acclaim as
any kind of bargaining chip. However, he did use the press conference as an
opportunity to remind CNN its journalists are severely underpaid when compared
to their counterparts at ABC, CBS and NBC.;    "I'm very concerned," he said.
"We've lost some outstanding people. The only way to keep good people is to
pay them," he said.;    Though Shaw said he has received offers from other
networks in the wake of his Baghdad experience, he expressed his loyalty to
CNN. (Even if he wanted to leave, CNN has him under contract until February
1993.);    All through the gulf war coverage, CNN's ratings have surged. The
reporting by Shaw and his colleagues from Baghdad is widely seen as a
principal reason for the surge in CNN viewing.;    But CNN has adopted a
strict "no stars" policy since it was started by Ted Turner a decade ago. That
policy has kept the network from having to pay the huge salaries Brokaw,
Rather, Jennings and many other broadcast news stars receive.;    Many now
believe the emergence of Shaw as a major news celebrity will force CNN to
renegotiate his contract and maybe even start paying bigger money to its other
rising gulf war stars.;    Asked if this means the end of the "no stars"
policy at the network, Shaw said it probably doesn't.;    "It's quite possible
to have a handsome salary and not have a star on your door," he said.;
Caught in air raids;    One reason Shaw has been somewhat embarrassed by all
the publicity surrounding his Baghdad stint is the rather accidental nature of
it. He flew to Baghdad during the week before the war to try for an interview
with Saddam Hussein.;    Unable to get the interview, Shaw was ready to leave
Baghdad the morning after the air raids began. His flight canceled, he
realized he had no choice but to stay at the Al-Rashid Hotel until some other
way out could be arranged.;    In the meantime, Shaw and the others discovered
they were the only reporters still in Baghdad with communications to the
outside world. They began using their "four-wire" phone, which bypassed the
inoperative hotel switchboard and bombed-out Baghdad telephone system, to
relay reports home by satellite.;    "I was just doing my job, like any other
reporter," he said.;    But those who listened to Shaw's reports noticed
something extra that lifted them above the ordinary. He had become much more
personal, even revealing what many felt was severe signs of stress.;    "I was
very much aware of the stress," Shaw recalled. "I began thinking of the people
and places that I loved back home.";    The result was heavily emotional,
deeply affecting reports that persuaded even those familiar with Shaw's work
that he was a changed man, letting much more of himself show through. The
comparisons with his idol, Murrow, began.;    "When I was 13 years old, I
decided I wanted to be just like him," Shaw said, though clearly uncomfortable
with the comparison. "I know it's a compliment, but that comparison gives me
pause.";    Shaw now acknowledges he was under severe stress all during the
stay in Baghdad. He went more than 40 hours without sleep, followed by a
hectic, frightening 15-hour drive to the Jordanian border with an Iraqi driver
after Iraq ordered CNN shut down and the correspondents to leave. (The
decision to let Arnett stay on came later.);    After their arrival back at
CNN headquarters in Atlanta, the network inveigled Shaw and Holliman into
going right on its "Larry King Live" talk show to tell of their ordeal. Shaw
appeared tired, strained and severely shaken on that show.;    Now that he has
returned to near-universal acclaim, Shaw has begun to put the whole experience
in perspective. He's not anxious to return to the war front and, in fact, has
just about made up his mind to refuse if asked to go back by CNN.;    "We were
pretty much pushing the margin," said Shaw. "I've decided I'll never again put
myself or my family in that situation again. I've never, in 27 years, refused
an assignment, but I will from now on."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>NBC News Chief Predicts Resurgence for ``Today''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC News President Michael Gartner admitted to
affiliates that changes he approved in the ``Today'' show put it in
a slump, but he predicted it will be back on top in the morning
ratings.
   Gartner also announced Monday the start in January of a 24-hour
NBC News channel for the network's 208 affiliates.
   Affiliate executives were heading to Capitol Hill today to seek
help on cable issues and urge that NBC and its network rivals be
free from federal bans on financial interests in shows the networks
don't solely own.
   At the start of NBC's annual affiliates convention, Gartner
frankly addressed the decline in ``Today'' ratings since Jane Pauley
left as co-host in December.
   ``That's got to be the starting point, the willingness to admit _
in this case _ the obvious,'' said Eric Bremner of King Broadcasting
in Seattle, the new chairman of the NBC affiliates board.
   ``I think it was well-received,'' he said.
   Once first in ratings, ``Today'' has been second to ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' for 21 weeks.
   Its slide started in January after Pauley's replacement by
Deborah Norville as co-host with Bryant Gumbel. The popular Pauley,
who was unhappy with other changes on the show and asked to leave,
had been on ``Today'' for 13 years.
   To get the show moving again, Gartner brought in a new executive
producer, Tom Capra, and is bringing back former ``Today'' host Joe
Garagiola on June 11 as third co-host.
   Without mentioning specifics, Gartner told affiliates that ``we
know we screwed up the `Today' show ... he (Capra) knows what the
show needs and he knows how to provide it.
   ``Now, with the dust settled, he'll make it, we'll make it,
another winner.''
   Garagiola appeared on stage with the ``Today'' cast and kidded
with weatherman Willard Scott.
   But the affiliate executives greatest affection was for Pauley,
who got a standing ovation.
   ``I have never been happier in my work,'' said Pauley, now
preparing a series of prime time specials for NBC. She is the
substitute evening news anchor when Tom Brokaw is away.
   Gartner predicted better times ahead for the ``NBC Nightly
News,'' third in ratings for seven straight weeks. He introduced the
show's new executive producer, Steve Friedman, calling him a ``show
doctor'' who will make the newscast ``sparkle.''
   Friedman ran ``Today'' when it rose to first in ratings. He left
NBC in 1987 to create what proved a costly syndicated flop, ``USA
Today on TV.''
   The normally brash producer made no promises of a fast ratings
rise, but said there would be changes to make the newscast a
contender. He declined to announce the changes citing competitive
reasons.
   Network newscasts can ``no longer just index the day's events,''
he said. ``We can't come on and say, `These are the top stories.'
People have heard them already.
   ``We are going to do a show of interest, not the show of
record,'' he said.
   The 24-hour news service announced by Gartner will provide
affiliates with international, national, regional and breaking news
for use in their own newscasts, said Robert Horner, in charge of the
service.
   Although at first glance similar to Cable News Network, the NBC
service won't have anchors and won't transmit stories on a non-stop
basis, as CNN does.
   It is intended to help NBC stations compete with CNN's newscasts,
and to ward off further encroachments by CNN on NBC stations.
   CNN says it has 216 broadcast affiliates, of which 52 also are
NBC affiliates.
   NBC's convention will end Wednesday.

   It may be the news-by-satellite era. But when
the major networks began coverage of Wednesday's U.S. military
strike in Panama shortly after midnight, the reports from their
correspondents there came by phone.
   The reason: Gunmen loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegia barred
them from a satellite transmission, network executives said. No
pictures of the U.S. attack's results or street scenes in Panama
City were seen until after 9 a.m. EST, and then they were on tape,
not live.
   NBC got embroiled in a small war of its own _ complaints from
WTN, a London-based TV news agency serving CBS, ABC and CNN, that
NBC had aired nearly four minutes of WTN footage without
permission. An NBC spokesman said that was inadvertent, and that
NBC anchor Tom Brokaw told viewers the same thing.
   But WTN president Kenneth A. Coyte, in a letter to NBC News
president Michael Gartner, protested ``in the strongest possible
terms'' NBC's action, calling it a ``cynical breach of professional
standards.''
   However, NBC officials said, all four U.S. networks shortly
afterwards agreed to pool their Panama footage. By mid-morning, the
networks simultaneously were airing long-distance night shots of
military buildings burning, white tracer bullets shooting
occasionally shooting skyward and shadowy gunmen on streets.
   The networks also aired early daytime shots of Army helicopters
landing, two Air Force C-130 transports flying several thousand
feet above Panama City's Marriott Hotel, and U.S. paratroopers,
faces daubed in dark green camouflages, taking positions near
trees, signs and parks.
   At times, the war on TV took on an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.
Brokaw, interviewing a Panama City resident by phone on the
``Today'' show, asked him what local broadcasters were reporting.
   Eloi Benedetti said he was watching reports of the U.S. strike
on the U.S. Armed Forces TV station, which also carried CNN. Brokaw
asked if the station was describing what was going on on the ground
in Panama.
   ``Well,'' Benedetti said, ``they're actually relaying the CNN
broadcast.''
   It was a risky story for correspondents _ CNN used a stringer,
Berta Thayer _ and producers. Some among the crowd of journalists
at the Marriott Hotel reported that gunmen waiting outside had
threatened them, made it too dangerous to leave the hotel.
   Four men thought to be Noriega loyalists seized two network
producers in the hotel lobby. They later released one, ABC's Robert
Campos, several hours later, ABC said. CBS said it was checking
unconfirmed reports that the other producer, Jon Meyersohn, who
worked for CBS, also had been freed.
   NBC's Ed Rabel, reporting from the Marriott, fled to a nearby
U.S. military installation after gun-waving ``goons'' threatened
his life, according to NBC News senior vice president Joseph
Angotti, running NBC's operation here.
   ``They said they didn't want him or any other gringos around,
that if they found him the next time they came around, they'll kill
him,'' Angotti said.
   The U.S. military operation against Noriega was accompanied by a
Pentagon news pool that included NBC's Fred Francis, pool reporter
for the networks. One of his reports, shown on CNN, included a
discussion with CNN anchor Bernard Shaw of what he'd seen.
   The reporters were flown in on Air Force transports, but not
early enough, one CBS executive said.
   ``We stll don't have information why the pool didn't go in with
an early wave (of soldiers), or why they were held back ... until
pretty late in the game,'' said Don Decesare, CBS' vice president
for news coverage.
   The pool system was developed after a controversy over the ban
on reporters accompanying the initial phases of the U.S. attack in
Grenada in 1982. This group's TV gear included a portable satellite
ground station.
   But even though reporters were flown around the battle areas in
helicopters, it appeared late Wednesday afternoon that unexplained
snags had developed and there'd be no pool pictures from the
transmitter, DeCesare said.
   ``They have the capacity to feed (video reports),'' he said.
``However, we still have yet to receive anything.''
   He and his NBC and ABC counterparts were relieved when, at about
35 minutes before their networks' first evening newscasts, the
pool's videotape footage began coming in from Panama. Some shots
were taken over a the shoulder of a helicopter door gunner.
