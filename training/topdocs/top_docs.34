   Dow Chemical Co. said Friday it decided to
keep its middle name _ as well as the first and last _ after a
six-month study concluded the company shouldn't change its
92-year-old identity.
   Dow's president and chief executive officer, Frank Popoff, said
an internal committee and an outside consultant looked into changing
the corporate identity for more than six months before recommending
against any change.
   Company spokesman Tom Henderson said he did not know how much the
study cost. He declined to reveal any of the alternate names or
identities that may have been considered, saying such information
was confidential.
   In October, reports on the study said the company was considering
dropping ``chemical'' from its name. Henderson said at the time that
if there were to be a name change, it would be because of Dow's
expanding role in non-chemical fields, including insulation and
household goods.
   Henderson said Friday he didn't think that the association of the
Dow name with Napalm explosives and the Agent Orange defoliant used
during the Vietnam War had a lasting detrimental effect on the
company.
   ``I don't think it was part of the consideration of changing the
name,'' he said. ``We are not inundated any more with negatives
around the Agent Orange issue.''

<HL> Now, After 91 Years, Dow Chemical Co. May Change Name --- Problem Word Is 'Chemical': The Public Distrusts It, So Most Firms Drop It </HL>

<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. is thinking about changing its name after 91 years and numerous image-wrenching controversies. 

   Dow officials confirmed they have hired a corporate image consultant and organized a team internally to consider whether a new name would help the company's image. 
At issue is whether Dow should keep the word 'chemical' in its name. 
The Midland, Mich., company is one of the last major chemical corporations to do so. 

   "Let's face it," says Richard K. Long, Dow Chemical's corporate communications director, who is heading the name-change study: "That word does nobody much good these days. 
Chemical has a less than desirable public connotation." 

   The public has tended to associate 'chemical' companies with pollution and other health hazards. 

   Dow officials also dislike the word chemical because it fails to identify Dow's involvement in other businesses such as consumer products and pharmaceuticals. 
"It's a question of whether we're a chemical company or a company that happens to practice chemistry," Mr. Long said. 

   Disdain for the C-word is nothing new in the chemical industry. 
St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. dropped 'chemical' from its name in 1964 when the company diversified into other businesses. 
But Monsanto also wanted to distance itself from public outcry against chemical companies in general. 
"There's a school of thought that if you've got that word in your name, you're a target for trouble," a Monsanto official says. 

   DuPont Co., the nation's largest chemical concern, even went so far as to drop the end of its corporate slogan, which once read: "Better things for better living through chemistry." 

   Still, Dow stubbornly clung to its name. 
The company stayed with it in the 1960s when Vietnam War protestors criticized Dow for its napalm production. 
Uproars over dioxin, Agent Orange and other environmental contaminations traced to Dow also failed to convince company executives to make a switch. 

   "Basically, the thinking was our customers knew who we were with our old name and they weren't reacting negatively to the controversies," says Mr. Long. 

   There is also a lot of tradition working against changing the name, which the company has had since Herbert H. Dow founded it in 1897. 
Many executives see the continuity as a source of corporate pride. 

   But the negative associations with the word chemical may win the day. 
The name-change study is a continuation of the company's recent efforts to project a friendlier public image, sparked by former chief executive officer Paul F. Oreffice, who said a name change might do the company some good. 

   In January, Dow hired the New York image firm Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc. for help with the idea and has since assigned 14 of its own people to work with the project. 

   Not that Dow will stray far from its current name. 
Mr. Long insists that the Dow part will stay, although no final recommendations have been given to top management. 
"Maybe it will be Dow Industries," he says. 
"We want something that won't make us look like we're running away to hide from anything."

<TEXT>
   Employees at Dow Chemical Co. know that beaten-down feeling all too well. 
First they went through the public outcry over napalm during the Vietnam War. 
Then came the discovery of dioxin contamination right in Dow's corporate back yard. 
Then Agent Orange, raging battles with environmental authorities and humiliating attempts to defend the company's integrity on national television. 

   Top management only made matters worse; it seemed to relish a good public fight. 
A string of combative chief executive officers angrily shouldered through controversy -- and drew lines in the sand, daring regulators and environmentalists to step across. 
By 1983, one manager recalls sadly, morale had sunk so low that longtime chemists and researchers removed their company pins before boarding business flights. 

   Today, corporate confrontation is out, or so Dow says, and a new age of sensitivity is in. 
In fact, the company is seeking nothing less than public redemption through an extraordinary image-makeover campaign. 

   The ingredients: a schmaltzy $60 million advertising effort; a performance-review system that takes into account a manager's public-relations skills; the sharing of more information with regulators; support for legislation that is pleasing even to environmentalists; and, not surprisingly, extra effort to cozy up to the media. 

   "These folks were right out there with Attila the Hun," says Rep. Dennis Eckart, referring to Dow's early opposition to legislation to clean up hazardous waste (the company now supports the so-called Superfund). 
The Ohio Democrat says Dow has changed course "180 degrees. 
The receptivity for its ideas has increased severalfold." 
Adds Gordon Britton, the editor of the Midland Daily News, long a Dow target: "We're in imminent danger of being hugged to death." 

   Dow's bout with self-analysis was long overdue. 
"We had made a lot of enemies who could influence our future," says Richard Long, then Dow's Washington public-affairs manager who headed a company task force to deal with its image problem. 
"We recognized we had to clean up our act." 

   They also recognized a new fact of corporate life: Dow, once mainly a commodities chemical maker, has thrust itself into pharmaceuticals and consumer products, a move that may have made it even more sensitive to public opinion. 
Dow's campaign also reflects broader efforts by the chemical industry to buff up its image. 

   Skeptics scoff at Dow's campaign as glitz with no substance. 
Ralph Nader, just one of the consumer advocates watching the company, believes that Dow has got off easy during the conservative Reagan years; others say the truth about Dow's apparent enlightenment won't be known until the next crisis hits the company. 

   Indeed, old personas do die hard. 
In 1985, not long after Dow's image-switching campaign started, a manager was caught circulating results from a confidential blood test that incorrectly said a Greenpeace activist arrested on Dow property had a venereal disease. 

   And a few weeks ago, Frank Popoff, who on Dec. 1 succeeds Dow's fiery chief executive, Paul Oreffice, came out swinging. 
When a jury decided against Dow in a drug liability case, Mr. Popoff contended that the black plaintiff had won because the jury and judge were black. (The judge, in fact, is white.) 
Later, Mr. Popoff said he meant only that there was compassion between people of similar backgrounds. 
"I did a dumb thing. 
I was just a little more descriptive than I had to be," he says. 
But the damage was done. 
People inside and outside the company glimpsed the old Dow, once again reflexively putting up its dukes. 

   Dow may have grown defensive over the years partly because it has so dominated its own surroundings. 
The company is still based in the small central Michigan town of 37,000 where a young entrepreneur named Herbert H. Dow set up shop in 1897 to exploit huge subterranean brine deposits. 
Eventually, Dow became this country's second-largest chemical company, behind Du Pont Co. 

   But despite its world-wide expansion, Dow clings to its small-town ways. 
Although the last three chief executives, including Mr. Popoff, are foreign-born, only three of Dow's 16 directors are from outside the company. 
The Dow name is everywhere in Midland: There is the Grace Dow Library as well H.H. Dow High School. 
"This is a small town," plaintively says a young manager who recently moved to Midland. 
"I went to the movies Friday; I knew the whole row!" 

   Above all, though, Dow became a scientists' shop, an unsentimental sanctum sanctorum for chemical engineers. 
To employees, its sprawling buildings don't have names, just numbers (headquarters is 2030, research and development is in 1776). 
There is no glitzy executive dining room, just a spartan cafeteria with plastic trays where top managers, including the chief executive, can be found balancing the day's special at the steam table. 

   "Dow's personality has always been very technical, very small town, very sure of ourselves," says Carl Gerstacker, a former chairman. 
"We always thought that if you were technically right, you were right in the end." 

   Matters of principle fueled Dow's fights. 
Supporting the armed forces, for example, kept Dow in the napalm business in the 1960s, even though the contract contributed only a fraction of 1% of the company's net income and made Dow a target of the anti-war movement. 
In one instance, a Dow recruiter had to escape from a window after protesters set the university placement office afire. 
Dow still gets questions about napalm, even though it stopped making the flammable gel 17 years ago. 

   In 1977, Jane Fonda delivered a speech at nearby Central Michigan University and, among other things, accused Dow of making chemicals that caused sterility in workers. 
Again on principle, Mr. Oreffice fired off a letter to the university's president blasting those who would pay "an avowed Communist sympathizer like Jane Fonda" a speaker's fee to "spread her venom against free enterprise." 
With that, he cut off Dow financing to the university. 

   When newspapers picked this up, Dow was flooded with supportive mail, but many people back at headquarters simply cringed. 
"There was some feeling he had overreacted," says William Coffey, a former Dow public-relations manager. 

   Then there was the EPA. 
In the late 1970s, the agency wanted information on airborne emissions from Dow's forest of plants in Midland. 
Dow said no. 
So the EPA rented a plane to fly over them. 
Dow sued and took the case all the way to the Supreme Court before losing. 
And in 1981, an EPA official showed Dow a draft report holding the company responsible for much of the dioxin contamination in the Midland area. 
Dow edited out the most damaging conclusions before the EPA issued the report. 
Later, word got out, the EPA ran into heavy criticism, and Dow got another black eye. 

   "Every time a battle came up, we took it on," one executive says. 
"It was, 'We're right, we know more than you do.'" 

   The company maintained that the only proven ill effect in humans from dioxin was a skin rash called chloracne, although other studies linked dioxin to birth defects and cancer. 
Dow's assurances didn't mute public alarm when dioxin showed up in the Midland area, just as Vietnam veterans were suing Dow over health problems that they contend they got from Dow's Agent Orange defoliants during the war. 
The case was settled just before going to trial. 

   Worn down, Dow turned introspective. 
Largely under the guidance of Keith McKennon, Dow's head of U.S. operations and government and public affairs, a company task force surveyed 213 employees, managers, directors and outsiders about Dow's public posture. 
Observed one respondent to the survey: "Okay to stomp on a snake in your path, but don't go 30 yards out of your path to look for a snake to stomp." 
The internal report itself concluded: "The current reputation of The Dow Chemical Co. with its many publics may well be at an all-time low. 
We are viewed as tough, arrogant, secretive, uncooperative and insensitive." 

   Meanwhile, a shift in business strategy, led by Mr. Oreffice, also invited change in the company's approach to the public. 
That shift is graphically evident at Dow's 1,600-acre Michigan division chemical works. 
There, amid dozens of plants, two 150-foot-high distillation columns, the remnants of a styrene operation, stand rusting; in a new building nearby, though, Dow is making a granular, super-absorbing substance called Drytech, the latest thing in diaper material. 

   Dow's cutback in basic-chemicals capacity and its increased investment in specialty and consumer products have prompted the company, since 1980, to shed $1.5 billion in assets, write down or off an additional $1 billion in plants and operations, and trim its world-wide payroll by 9,000 employees to 52,000 now. 
That strategy, many analysts believe, will cushion Dow against cyclical slumps in basic chemicals. 
Thanks to this recasting and a basic-chemicals boom, Dow's profit in the first nine months of this year soared to a record $888 million on sales of $9.8 billion. 

   Unlike tankers of chlorine, though, products such as Drytech, antihistamines and laxatives put Dow much closer to the buying public, an added impetus for better public relations, insiders say. 

   Shaken by its internal survey, Dow considered dozens of proposals, including even changing its name. 
It settled on a big "outreach" program. 
"Openness is the single word I'd use: our desire to communicate" with broad groups, Mr. McKennon says. 

   Dow has opened its plant sites around the country to hundreds of tours. 
It has invited, for example, a Texas state senate subcommittee to its Gulf Coast operations and has shown Rep. James J. Florio, a New Jersey Democrat and big backer of the Superfund, around its Louisiana facility. 
Its scientific "road shows" and its advice to line managers to join more community groups are raising its profile. 

   What's more, the company has sent out thousands of copies of its Public Interest Report, which lists Dow's philanthropic activities. 
It has made organ-donor education its public cause, and bowing to "growing public concern," it begrudgingly pulled out of South Africa earlier this year. 
It set up a special 800 inquiry line for reporters, supported a science-journalism project and launched a "Dow Lets You Do Great Things" ad campaign. 
A Dow-commissioned survey says the campaign has raised positive reaction to the company six percentage points, to 29%, within a few months. 

   It also is trumpeting its expertise in hazardous-waste reduction, even joining last month with environmentalists at a news conference endorsing related new legislation. 
"This is the first time the Sierra Club was on the same side of an issue as Dow," says Anne Woiwode, a member of Sierra's Michigan chapter. 

   Howard Zar, who heads an EPA dioxin task force in Chicago, says Dow now is voluntarily sharing more plant data. 
He believes that the company realizes it has more to gain by helping the EPA determine proper effluent levels than by having limits imposed unilaterally. 

   However, Dow hasn't changed its stance that dioxin's ill effects are limited, and it is resisting current proposals to make the Clean Air Act more stringent. 
And although Mr. Oreffice, who will remain chairman after Dec. 1, apparently heeded advice to take the stridency out of Dow's corporate message, he remains skeptical about how much the company erred in the past. 
An Italian immigrant possessed of disarming candor, Mr. Oreffice concludes bluntly: "I think we got a bum rap. 
I think the whole chemical industry has been treated shabbily." 

   Better to take on government regulators than complain about them after the fact, he says. 
"I'm a competitor. 
We just don't like losing without a fight." 
And as for the Jane Fonda incident: "I would do it again. 
Here she was, spreading her venom." 
Mr. Oreffice adds that new people at the EPA, not just a change in attitude at Dow, are contributing to thawed relations. 

   "Paul doesn't have it in his system to say we screwed up," says one manager who has worked with Mr. Oreffice, adding: "It's commonly accepted among management that we went way overboard on these issues." 

   His successor, Mr. Popoff, is said to be readier to compromise. 
"The form is to be less adversarial; the substance is still to defend the Dow Chemical Co.," he says. 
"Oh, come let us reason together." 

   However, Mr. Popoff, who spent most of the past 20 years with Dow abroad, hasn't yet received his baptism of fire in domestic public-relations battles. 
Dow still prides itself on its science and is loath to appear a pushover; thus, Mr. Popoff will probably get his chance. 
So will the other apostles of Dow's new religion. 
Observes Mr. Gerstacker, the former chairman: "The basic personality of the company hasn't changed."

<TEXT>     And in Tehran, the Iranian government accused Baghdad of kidnapping the

Jabr, speaking from Nicosia, Cyprus, said the Iraqi government has been

accept the destruction of its nuclear weapons-grade materials, ballistic
missiles and chemical and biological weapons before the overall embargo is

<TEXT>
   A defunct storage company and its former
president have been charged with conspiracy to illegally dispose of
hazardous wastes, including surplus napalm bombs, near people's
homes, officials said today.
   ``This case represents perhaps the most serious type of
environmental misconduct,'' U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said at a news conference.
   He said that the 12-count federal grand jury indictment was the
first federal felony prosecution of environmental crime in Utah.
The company, EKOTEK, and its officers had ``duped environmentally
conscious businesses into believing that waste materials were being
properly disposed of,'' Thornburgh said.
   The indictment alleges the company knowingly burned, poured out
and improperly stored a variety of hazardous wastes in violation of
an array of state and federal laws in the middle and late 1980s.
The site is now on the Superfund cleanup list.
   Among the incidents leading to the indictment was that of a
17-year-old boy who reported that his shoe began to bubble and
disintegrate after he accidentally stepped in some liquid while
running near the site, officials said. Tests have been conducted
around 125 homes near the site.
   The charges were filed Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District
Court.
   Named in the indictment were EKOTEK and Steven M. Self, the
company's president. The company was involuntarily dissolved Nov. 1.
   If convicted on all charges, Self could face a prison term of up
to 45 years, and he and the company would face up to $24 million in
fine.
   Company vice president Steven F. Miller pleaded guilty Wednesday
to felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal resource
conservation and recovery laws and the Clean Water Act, Thornburgh
said.
   Miller was allowed to plead guilty in exchange for his
cooperation in the prosecution of Self, authorities said. He could
face up to 13 years in prison and a $750,000 fine; sentencing was
set for July 10.
   Self and his company are alleged to have purchased millions of
gallons of oil and solvents and burned them as fuel in a refinery
in northern Salt Lake City about three miles northwest of the
downtown area. The burning violated the federal Clean Air Act. In
other cases, wastes were illegally poured into storm drains or
stored in an improper manner.
   State Department of Health officials said tens of thousands of
gallons of the wastes have leaked into the ground and contaminated
nearby homes.
   In addition, the indictment alleges that in July 1986, Self
arranged to accept two napalm bombs for ``testing, storage and
treatment'' from the Navy Weapons Support Center in Fallbrook,
Calif. State explosives experts had to haul the bombs away and
dispose of them in 1987.
   The site, currently being cleaned up through the Environmental
Protection Agency's Superfund program, reportedly still contains
almost a half million gallons of used petroleum products and other
toxic wastes in leaking tanks and drums.
   Among the chemicals found at the plant were poisonous
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs; methylene chloride, which has
been linked to tumors; and the toxic solvents n-butyl acetate,
methyl ethyl ketone, toluene and xylene.
   The site was identified for EPA cleanup in 1988. The agency has
identified 32 companies as being responsible for cleanup of
approximately 500,000 gallons of aging, used petroleum products and
other hazardous wastes at the site.
   EKOTEK-Petrochem formerly operated an oil refinery on the site.
The state Division of Environmental Health had determined it might
pose a risk to nearby residents and the EPA took soil samples from
land surrounding about 125 homes earlier this year.

<TEXT>     But with night's advance, an icy rain turns the desert into an oozing stew.
Lightning comes in great broad strokes against the smoke screen that passes
here for sky. Later, there will be Iraqi artillery fire in the distance,
bright orange tracer bullets and flares slitting the damp darkness.;    Here
between Kuwait and Iraq, there is neither war nor peace -- only varying
degrees of dying. In the long food and medical lines in what is left of the
village of Safwan, 5,000 Iraqi citizens and refugees depend now on the mercy
of American GIs for survival.;    "Last month we were killing them," said Army
Lt. Col John Kalb. "This month we're fixing them.";    Kalb is not as flippant
as he may sound. Without him and his soldiers, the people here would very soon
start to die. Kuwait considers them enemies; Iraq considers them traitors. In
this vise grip of international politics, the children are filthy and
fatherless and resorting to roadside pantomime to cop candy from passing Land
Cruisers full of reporters.;    "Someone from the State Department came
through here yesterday," Kalb said. "They must have noticed these people need
help, because, before we knew it, we were out here passing out food rations
and bottled water. There wasn't anyone helping them, and that's the trick bag
they're in now.";    As captured Iraqi ammunition dumps are blown up by
Americans off in the desert distance, babies are brought to medics at Army
checkpoints, dehydrated and cradled by mothers fleeing the terror of civil war
in Basra and Nassariyah. But with the rebellion now apparently faltering in
these cities, the children's wounds seen by Army doctor Carolyn Sullivan are
no longer the wounds of war, but rather the wounds of its terrible legacy.;   
"We're seeing some children burned by old ordnance that exploded when they
picked it up or walked on it," said Sullivan. "I'm seeing kids with parts of
limbs blown off, kids burned from picking up things that blow up in their
hands." Friday, her unit treated 191 people in a tent beside the road to
Nassariyah.;    Every soldier here has a horror story.;    Jeff Robinson, an
Arabic interpreter from the Utah National Guard, has seen a 2-year-old with
shrapnel wounds in her shoulder.;    At another checkpoint farther up the
road, Army Sgt. Zachary Madsen said he had a father and son walk up to him
recently. The son's entire left leg was burned -- by Iraqi army napalm, the
father said. "It was a real deep burn, blistered and black," Madsen said. "The
man said four of his children died in their home from the bomb and the
napalm.";    These checkpoints are little desert isles of homesick soldiers
dug in at abandoned overpasses, suspended somewhere between bored and bonkers.
Around them lies a lonesome junkyard of burned-out tanks and armored personnel
carriers, the legacy of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's mistake of a battle.;
   Nothing seems quite right out here: You see the burned-out husks of cars in
the middle lane. You see trucks driving backward down exits. You see buses
blown to smithereens. And you see Iraqi refugees wandering off into the sands,
or Iraqi soldiers scurrying along the highway in the rain, trying desperately
to turn themselves in to the Americans.;    Two young Iraqi men -- one
claiming to be a teacher of Arabic, the other a student at the college in
Basra -- flag down a car, the only one to come along in a half-hour.;    They
had just tried to cross a checkpoint, but "the American soldiers sent us
back," says the student, who is afraid to have his name appear in print.
"Saddam Hussein has killed all the people. We all hate Saddam Hussein, but we
are not strong enough to fight him. He hit Karpala with napalm and chemicals.
He killed us in the streets like dogs.";    Asked if he knew anyone personally
who had been killed, the man grows agitated. "Yes!" he shouts. "They killed my
mother. And they killed some of my neighbors.;    "But now we put our fate in
America's hands. If we go back, Saddam will kill us. What can we do? All the
doors have been closed to us now.";    Even farther up the road, at the last
and deepest American checkpoint inside Iraq, four soldiers huddle inside a
tent beside the highway. This is the end of the American road, the official
line of demarcation etched out on military maps at meetings between the Iraqis
and the allies. Beyond it about 500 yards, Iraqi soldiers operate their own
last checkpoint before the enemy area begins.;    "We're picking up quite a
few Iraqi soldiers," said Staff Sgt. Joe Stewart, 34, of Alexandria, Ky. "We
search them for weapons, then send them south to the next checkpoint, where
they're processed as enemy prisoners of war."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Napalmed Vietnamese Girl Reunited With Her Pulitzer-Winning Photographer</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos LA1,2,3 of Aug. 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The napalmed Vietnamese girl in the Pulitzer
Prize-winning picture that came to symbolize the atrocity of war is
planning a trip to America with a message of reconciliation and hope.
   Phan Thi Kim Phuc was a terrified 9-year-old running from her
napalmed South Vietnam village one June day in 1972 when Associated
Press photographer Nick Ut captured her moment of agony for the ages.
   The gripping picture appeared on newspaper front pages
nationwide, enshrining Kim as a personification of Vietnamese
suffering, and ravaging the American conscience.
   Unseen in the photograph were the ghastly burns. ``Her whole back
and neck and arm were black like barbecue,'' Ut recalls.
   ``There was terrible heat. I was running, running, running away.
I tore off my burning clothes. But the burning didn't stop. I was
alone with that terrible heat,'' Kim told Los Angeles Times Magazine
writer Judith Coburn on the eve of a scheduled six-week trip across
America.
   Kim and Ut met again on July 24, their first meeting in 17 years,
during a brief reunion in Havana.
   ``To me, she's part of the family,'' said Ut, whose famous
picture hangs in the den of his suburban Los Angeles home. ``I tell
my children Bettina and Michael, who were born in America, how lucky
they are to escape war.''
   Ut fled Vietnam in April 1975 and worked two years in the AP's
Tokyo bureau before transferring to the Los Angeles office, where he
continues to work as a staff photographer.
   The Havana reunion was a shock for Ut. The wounded child he
photographed and took to a hospital in 1972 had grown into a
beautiful woman, the scars on her back, chest and arm concealed
beneath a T-shirt.
   Kim accepted a Vietnamese government invitation to go to Cuba in
1986, where she eventually began studies in pharmacology. She now
lives in a student apartment within a Havana highrise.
   ``I want to live my life, marry, have children,'' she said,
adding she's ``a joyful young woman.''
   Her U.S. visit, tentatively set for this fall, will attempt to
soothe lingering bitterness from the bloody Southeast Asian conflict
of two decades ago.
   ``If I ever see those (South Vietnamese) pilots who dropped the
bombs on me, or any American pilots, I would say to them, `The war
is over.' The past is the past,'' she said. ``I would ask those
pilots what can they do to bring us all together.
   ``There's such a connection between Vietnam and America, but it
would be one of friendship. Not bitterness. Not enemies. But I'm not
coming to America to talk about the war.
   ``I'm coming so Americans can meet the girl in the photo ...''
   The 26-year-old woman also wants to see the Statue of Liberty and
the Golden Gate bridge.
   ``If she can forgive, why can't anyone?'' asks Merle Ratner of
the Committee to Welcome Kim Phuc, which is sponsoring her trip. The
visit is part of a campaign to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese relations.
   The photograph led Gen. William Westmoreland, commander in chief
of U.S. forces in Vietnam, to charge Ut's picture was a fake. The
general said Kim had been burned in ``a Hibachi accident.''
   Ut said he had traveled with other journalists to the village of
Trang Bang following three days of heavy fighting. The napalm that
routed Kim and other villagers fell in the early afternoon. As she
ran, the girl cried that her flesh was ``burning so hot,'' said Ut.
   Kim hopes the trip will raise money for her family in Vietnam and
for her return to the United States to study and get medical
treatment.
   Holding her scarred arm next to the untouched one, she asks:
``Don't you think the doctors in America could make them both look
the same?''

<TEXT>     The attack could come as soon as dawn Sunday, officers of the U.S. command
said, if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein does not heed demands from the
U.S.-led coalition that he begin pulling his forces out of Kuwait today.;   
"The start of land operations is programmed," French Defense Minister Pierre
Joxe said in Paris. "It's a question of a few hours.";    Anti-personnel
cluster bombs clattered down on Iraqi troop positions, dispatches from
front-line reporters said, and hundreds of canisters of napalm, the gel that
bursts into flame when it lands, were dumped into deep, oil-filled trenches in
front of enemy lines to try to burn off the oil.;    First use of napalm;  It
was the first reported use of napalm in the Persian Gulf war.;    Brig. Gen.
Richard Neal, the U.S. military spokesman, said at a briefing in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, that Saddam had ordered "a scorched-earth policy" in Kuwait, setting
fire to about 140 of the 950 oil wells in the emirate.;    He said that at
least 100 of them had exploded in the last 24 hours, and that tanks,
pipelines, warehouses and shipping terminals associated with the oil industry
had also been knocked out in a systematic campaign.;    The rising tempo of
allied ground operations, including highly aggressive probes from Saudi Arabia
into Iraq and Kuwait, also indicated that a land assault was imminent unless
the Iraqis quickly pulled back.;    So did a pointed statement from Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander, who said Friday night, "U.S. forces
are fully prepared for the execution of any action ordered by the president of
the United States.";    Six miles into Kuwait;    Saudi troops penetrated more
than six miles into Kuwaiti territory to open a lane through an Iraqi
minefield, a Saudi spokesman said, and they lifted about 75 mines without
encountering any enemy opposition.;    By late Friday, U.S. pilots and
listening posts had detected "not a shred of evidence" that the Iraqis were
preparing to leave Kuwait, said an officer at Schwarzkopf's headquarters in
Riyadh. He said there was "no radio traffic, no movement of tanks, trucks,
nothing.";    Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, warned in an interview published in France that the Iraqis had
mined every oil well in Kuwait, and allied intelligence officials said some of
the burning wells were sending plumes of fire and smoke 400 to 500 feet into
the air.;    Some of the fires were visible 40 miles away in Saudi Arabia,
their orange flames boldly outlined against the horizon. At Khafji, the border
town where the war's biggest battle so far was fought three weeks ago, the sky
was almost dark at midday.;    Iraq's behavior puzzled U.S. officials. Neal
said he was "as confused as you are" when asked by reporters to explain the
contradictions between Saddam's bellicose speech Thursday and the subsequent
peace negotiations in Moscow.;    Scud attacks;  While those negotiations were
under way, the wells were torched and a Scud missile was launched toward the
island nation of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf about 25 miles from Dhahran.;   
No one was hurt and no property damage was caused by that missile or three
others fired only a few hours earlier at Saudi cities. The first three, said
Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the Pentagon chief of operations, were all fired from
launchers positioned within Baghdad, a new operating procedure.;    "The
troops are in a difficult position, psychologically," said a Medical Corps
officer just back from an evacuation hospital in the north. "They have to
prepare for war and prepare to let go, too.";    But most soldiers said they
were deeply suspicious of Saddam's motives and thought that the only way to
deal with him was to attack.;    "Tell the boss we ought to go ahead and bash
this guy," said a military policeman.;    Start of ground war alleged;  In a
reflection, perhaps, of strained nerves, Baghdad Radio said early Friday that
"the enemy has started the ground battle.";    The U.S. command quickly denied
it, and a Pentagon official remarked, "If the Iraqis are leaping to the
conclusion that the ground battle has begun on the basis of a single division
shooting artillery fire, then they really don't comprehend the strength of the
firepower of the coalition."  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH TRAIL, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just off a red clay track beside
the sparkling Tchepone River is the reborn hamlet of Ban Dong Nai,
which American bombers pounded into oblivion a generation ago.
   Today, the villagers smile and welcome foreign visitors, but the
older ones still wonder what they did to deserve the terror that
rained from the skies between 1964 and 1973.
   American planes attacked Ban Dong Nai during the Indochina war
because the clay track was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the
network of jungle paths through eastern Laos and Cambodia used by
communist North Vietnam to move men and supplies into U.S.-backed
South Vietnam.
   Not far across the Vietnamese frontier is the former U.S. base
at Khe San, which Gen. William Westmoreland called the key to
stopping full-scale infiltration from the trail. U.S. Marines held
it during a 1968 siege that cost the lives of about 500 Americans
and 10,000 Vietnamese.
   The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the main target of America's ``secret
war'' in Laos, which involved 242,000 bombing sorties in 1969
alone. More than 2 million tons of bombs were dropped on Laos
altogether, surpassing the U.S. total in World War II.
   Lahoun Maprayvong, a former guerrilla and now an administrator
in Tchepone town, recalled the first day of bombing, during a
Buddhist festival in late 1964.
   ``We were warned, but we just didn't know what to expect,'' he
said, and the bombardment grew steadily worse. The planes came
every day for nine years, sometimes four or five times, then also
at night.
   Lahoun said villagers were most afraid of the huge B-52 bombers
the United States began using extensively in 1967.
   ``They flew so high you couldn't see them, so there was no
warning,'' he said. ``They dropped bombs in line _ Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! _ like that. If you were next in line, then that was it.''
   Each B-52 dropped 30 tons of bombs in ``boxes'' half a mile wide
and two miles long, gouging out permanent craters.
   ``When they bombed like that, people ran away to the mountains
to live in caves,'' Lahoun said. ``Some years, we had to change
places five times. When we came back, there was nothing left.''
   Ban Dong Nai and Tchepone were destroyed by 1973.
   Noi, who was a young girl in the 1960s, said her father was
killed in one attack. ``I just don't understand why the Americans
did what they did. You couldn't escape the bombs,'' she said.
   Khamlai was in her 20s in 1968 when she and her younger brother,
walking to a rice field, stepped on American mines.
   She looked down at the ugly metal and rubber left leg she has
worn for 22 years and said: ``Can you tell me how to make it more
beautiful?''
   Her brother lost both legs.
   People along the trail recalled day after day of napalm attacks.
Lahoun said some still suffer from injuries caused by napalm and
phosphorous bombs. Many hillsides stripped by chemical defoliants
remain bare.
   After South Vietnam's unsuccessful attack on the trail in 1971,
all the trees and bushes were burned away and the road was jammed
with the wreckage of tanks, helicopters and guns, said Phou
Wattana, a district official and former guerrilla.
   Villagers pointed out the hulk of an American-made tank and
chopped away long grass to uncover an artillery piece. Children
played near piles of rusty shells and bombs.
   ``They're only dangerous if you put them in the fire,'' a
policeman said with a shrug.
   Xoun, an old man who stays home from the rice paddies to watch
the children of Ban Dong Nai, used a machete to uncover unexploded
250- and 500-pound bombs.
   Many bomb craters remain in and around the village and Xoun said
thousands of small, unexploded anti-personnel bombs still kill and
maim farmers.
   ``When the planes came, we had to go and live in the forest for
many years,'' he said.
   ``As you can see, we are used to living peacefully around here.
There used to be lots of fruit trees _ jack fruit, coconut, banana
_ but after the Americans came, there was nothing left. We had to
rebuild everything, but the fruit trees won't grow anymore.''
   Lahoun said the United States should help.
   ``We hadn't done anything to hurt the Americans and they came to
drop bombs on us,'' he said. ``We ask the U.S. government to do
something to cure the damage they have done.''

Laos and Cambodia that North Vietnam used to move men and supplies into South 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Not far across the Vietnamese frontier is the former U.S. base at Khe San, 
which Gen. William C. Westmoreland called the key to stopping full-scale 
infiltration from the trail. U.S. Marines held it during a 1968 siege that cost 
the lives of about 500 Americans and 10,000 Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the main target of America's "secret war" in Laos, 
which involved 242,000 bombing sorties in 1969 alone. More than 2 million tons 
of bombs were dropped on Laos altogether, more than U.S. forces used in all of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Lahoun Maprayvong, a former guerrilla now an administrator in Tchepone town, 
recalled that first day of bombing, during a Buddhist festival in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"We were warned, but we just didn't know what to expect," he said. The 
bombardment grew steadily worse. The planes came every day for nine years, 
sometimes four or five times a day and also at night. 
</P>
<P>
Lahoun said the villagers were most afraid of the huge B-52 bombers the United 
States began using extensively in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"They flew so high you couldn't see them, so there was no warning," he said. 
"They dropped bombs in line -- Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! -- like that. If you were 
next in line, then that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Each B-52 dropped 30 tons of bombs in "boxes" half a mile wide and 2 miles 
long. They left permanent craters. 
</P>
<P>
"When they bombed like that, people ran away to the mountains to live in 
caves," Lahoun said. "Some years, we had to change places five times. When we 
came back, there was nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
Ban Dong Nai and Tchepone were gone by 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Noi, who was a young girl in the 1960s, said her father was killed in one 
attack. "I just don't understand why the Americans did what they did. You 
couldn't escape the bombs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Khamlai was in her twenties in 1968, when she and her younger brother, walking 
to a rice field, both stepped on American mines. 
</P>
<P>
She looked down at the ugly, metal-and-rubber left leg she has worn for 22 
years, and said: "Can you tell me how to make it more beautiful?" 
</P>
<P>
Her brother lost both legs. 
</P>
<P>
People along the trail recalled day after day of napalm attacks. Lahoun said 
that some of them still suffer from injuries caused by napalm and phosphorous 
bombs. Many hillsides stripped by chemical defoliants are still barren. 
</P>
<P>
After South Vietnam's unsuccessful attack on the trail in 1971, all the trees 
and bushes were burned away and the road was jammed with the wreckage of tanks, 
helicopters and guns, said Phou Wattana, a district official and former 
guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers pointed out the hulk of one American-made tank and chopped away the 
long grass to uncover an artillery piece. Children played near piles of rusty 
shells and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're only dangerous if you put them in the fire," a policeman said with a 
shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Xoun, an old man who stays home from the rice paddies to tend the children of 
Ban Dong Nai, used a machete to uncover unexploded 250-pound and 500-pound 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Many bomb craters remain in and around the village, and Xoun said that 
thousands of small, unexploded antipersonnel bombs remain to kill and maim 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"When the planes came, we had to go and live in the forest for many years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see, we are used to living peacefully around here. There used to be 
lots of fruit trees -- jackfruit, coconut, banana -- but after the Americans 
came, there was nothing left. We had to rebuild everything, but the fruit trees 
won't grow anymore."

<HEAD>Midland, Dow Have Good Chemistry _ Most of the Time</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once it was a dying lumber town in rural
Michigan, best known for the 14 bars on muddy Main Street.
   That was the Midland of the turn of the century, when a
fledgling chemical company called Dow decided to set up shop there.
   Today, the city of 37,000, about 100 miles north of Detroit,
lives and breathes Dow Chemical Co. The company provides jobs,
taxes, foundation money and an international ambience shared by few
other small Midwest cities.
   But it also spews fumes that smell faintly of solvent and
discharges treated wastewater into the local river, prompting
warnings that anglers shouldn't eat too many bottom fish.
   Nonetheless, the chemistry between Dow and Midland seems to
work. In many respects, it serves as a modern-day model for the
relationship between a city and a major employer, Midlanders say.
   ``We would perhaps be nonexistent if Dow had not come here and
established this chemical company,'' Assistant City Manager David
Wirth said.
   Dow Chemical has grown into Michigan's fourth-largest
manufacturer and a global giant since it was founded in 1897, and
it has taken Midland along for the ride.
   It all started with Herbert Henry Dow, who came to town in 1887
after getting a chemistry degree at Cleveland's Case Institute of
Technology.
   Major commerce in those days was a fading timber industry that
had surged as Chicago rebuilt after its disastrous fire of 1871.
   Dow tried something new. He began his business by drilling brine
wells and using electric charges to separate chemicals like
chlorine, bromine and sodium hydroxide, still the main ingredient
in Dow Oven Cleaner.
   ``Many of the people who came here with Dr. Dow and supported
him and started off with him became comfortably well off,'' said
Catherine Cummins, of the Midland Historical Society. ``Instead of
moving to Italy with a big boat or living in New York, many of them
are still in town.''
   Dow, with 55,500 workers worldwide, employs about a quarter of
Midland County's labor force of 35,250.
   The Michigan division of Midland serves as a research and
specialty division, producing things like latex and aspirin powder,
items that historically have withstood economic whims.
   Other Michigan cities haven't been so fortunate.
   Take the automaking town of Flint, about 50 miles south of
Midland. During the recession year of 1982, Flint's unemployment
rate averaged 21.1 percent, vs. 12.7 percent for Midland.
   Over the past 2{ years, Flint's jobless rate has seesawed
between 8.2 percent and 18.5 percent. Midland's unemployment ranged
from a high of 8.5 percent in January 1988 to 4.4 percent last
November.
   ``They're (Midland residents) really sheltered from the cyclical
sensitivity of the automotive industry,'' said Sandra St. Cyr, an
analyst for the Michigan Employment Security Commission.
   Dow also provides a tax shelter of sorts for Midland residents
by making up a quarter of the city's $1.3 billion tax base.
   Midland has at least 10 foundations endowed by Dow's founders
that pay for good schools and libraries, a busy theatrical and arts
center and a botanical garden.
   The relatively low jobless rate, coupled with the abundance of
educated Dow professionals that have become attracted to Midland's
schools and cultural activities, has helped keep the city's crime
rate low, some residents contend.
   ``I don't think there's a crack house in town,'' said Patrick
Dean, a Midland police officer since 1963 who once served as acting
police chief. ``It's been six or seven years since we had a
homicide.''
   In the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 1988, the most recent one
released, Midland tallied 1,402 reported crimes, half the number of
several similar-sized Michigan cities.
   Despite all that Dow contributes, there are drawbacks to having
a giant chemical company in the backyard.
   A recent ranking of the nation's worst toxic polluters shows Dow
ranked No. 29 and third in Michigan behind General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.
   The state first advised against eating fish from the
Tittabawassee River in 1978 after traces of the suspected
carcinogen dioxin were found in Dow's discharges. Greenpeace
canoeists paddled up the river in 1986 to plug Dow's outlets in
protest.
   In the late 1960s, demonstrators came to Dow's doors to protest
its manufacture of napalm jellied gasoline and defoliant Agent
Orange used in the Vietnam War.
   The company has since worked hard to portray a greener, cleaner
image.
   To cut dioxin discharges Dow installed a powerful waste-recovery
system. It also cooperates with environmental groups and
financially supports wetland preservation and recycling.
   The chemical bite to the air also seems to be growing fainter.
   ``I've lived here all my life, and let me tell you, you can't
smell anything now like you could before,'' said Dean, the Midland
police officer.
   The city has been spared serious chemical accidents, though
reminders of what could happen occur from time to time.
   Chlorine gas escaped a decade ago, sending emergency personnel
scrambling. Last year, three chemical tank cars derailed and
burned, sending billows of toxic smoke over nearby Freeland, where
3,000 residents were evacuated for a week.
   Nonetheless, Midland and its neighbors have also savored the
international flavor produced by Dow.
   ``People are more involved in the world ... (since) Dow has
facilities all over the world,'' said Gordon Britton, editor of
Midland Daily News.
   ``World Cup soccer is a non-event'' in many communities, said
Frank Popoff, Dow's president and chief executive officer, but not
in Midland.
   ``People here think that footballs are round with black spots on
them. You should kick them a lot. And not these elongated things.''

<TEXT>     Senegal's defense minister, Medoune Fall, said 92 of his nation's soldiers
died and three survived. He said an eight-day period of national mourning was
declared in Senegal.;    A Saudi military official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the crash occurred when the C-130 was trying to land at Ras
al-Mishab, on the coast just south of Khafji, after a flight from Jiddah. The
cause of the crash was not immediately known.;    The soldiers, who were
Muslims, were being flown back to their base after making a pilgrimage to
Mecca, Islam's holiest site, according to Senegal's Defense Ministry. It said
the dead would be buried in Saudi Arabia to be close to Islam's holiest
shrines.;    Iraq freed 1,150 Kuwaitis today, the Red Cross said, in
compliance with terms set down by the allies during cease-fire talks.;    A
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross announced the
release as a four-man Iraqi delegation began talks with allied officials in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on speeding up the repatriation of Iraqi prisoners of
war.;    The Kuwaitis were being brought in buses across the Iraqi-Saudi
border near the remote Saudi town of Arar 550 miles northwest of Riyadh, the
Saudi capital, said Red Cross spokesman Roland Huguenin.;    Meanwhile, the
civil war continued in Iraq, with the opposition claiming that Iraqi
helicopter gunships were dropping acid on Kurdish rebels in the north and that
attacks with napalm bombs and chemical weapons in the south have killed 15,000
people.;    Japanese television showed a videotape of Kurds celebrating in
Kirkuk, the northern Iraqi oil center the rebels claim to have captured. It
was the first independent confirmation of Kurdish reports that they controlled
Kirkuk.;    The Kurdistan Democratic Party announced Wednesday that rebels had
wiped out the last pockets of government resistance in Kirkuk, 140 miles north
of Baghdad after "intense street fighting.";    They said they controlled the
National Oil Co. and all oil fields and installations in Kirkuk.;    Today a
Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani, said the Kurds had taken more than 12,000
Iraqi prisoners of war in Kirkuk and had captured government anti-aircraft
batteries and artillery.;    "All the city is now in the hands of the Kurdish
resistance movement," he said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview from
Damascus, Syria.;    Talabani said the Kurdish rebels would next try to take
the city of Mosul and would cooperate with Shiite rebels in the south to try
to win control of the rest of the country.;    "We are discussing within the
joint committee the idea of a salvation committee for the Iraqi people," he
told the BBC.;    Another opposition group, the Supreme Assembly of the
Islamic Revolution of Iraq, said that after the Kurds' victory at Kirkuk,
"government helicopters dropped acid on people demonstrating against the
Baghdad regime, killing large numbers of them.";    The Assembly, based in
Iran, serves as an umbrella for opposition groups seeking to topple the
war-weakened Saddam Hussein after the allied victory in the Persian Gulf War.;
   Rebel claims that Saddam had used unconventional weapons to crush dissent
have been impossible to verify. The United States has said it had no evidence
that such weapons have been deployed.;    In a statement carried by the
official Iranian media, the assembly said Saddam's loyalist forces "used
ground-to-ground missiles, napalm bombs and chemical weapons against the
people in Najaf, killing more than 15,000 people.";    Also today, opposition
forces said Grand Ayatollah Abul-Hassan al-Khoei, the world's highest Shiite
authority, has been arrested in the strife-plagued city of Najaf and taken to
Baghdad.;    Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad, is the most sacred site for
Shiites. It houses the tomb of the founder of the sect, Imam Ali, Prophet
Mohammed's son-in-law.;    The official Iraqi News Agency had reported
Wednesday that Khoei had traveled to Baghdad, met with Saddam and expressed
his support for the government's drive to crush dissent.;    INA, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Khoei as saying God "enabled President Saddam Hussein to stamp
out the sedition." The television showed film of the meeting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The "daisy cutter" wreaks death and destruction on an area the equivalent
of 50 football fields, sucking oxygen and blood from those beneath it as it
explodes just above ground level. According to British defense consultants,
the tonnage of high explosives released in the gulf war has exceeded the
combined air offensive of World War II.;    Connell reports that "lawyers from
all branches of the service are on the battlefield." What a cruel,
unbelievable and impossible hoax! Ask any infantryman, any Marine when was the
last time he saw a lawyer nearby on the front lines.;    Where were the
lawyers when the United States bombed civilians in Panama or when bombing
victims were hurriedly buried in mass graves? Where were the ethicists when
the Contras were being provided with manuals advising how to administer
psychological and physical torture?;    Connell further misleads her readers
by stating that decisions about the use of napalm, white phosphorous and other
unthinkable weapons pose a moral dilemma for field commanders. Such decisions
are made at the highest level, which presumably includes the commander in
chief.;    The B-52 carpet bombing is a terror decision made by Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Colin Powell and President
Bush. By dropping more bombs than in all of World War II, the United States
has made a decision to use terror against the citizens and soldiers of Iraq.; 
  Those who advocate the use of those terror weapons take a higher moral
ground than those who try to clothe the use in some ethical and moral
camouflage. The former at least take responsibility for their statements.;   
Connell has inadvertently played the role of apologist for our government's
use of terror. I suggest that if she really wants to test the legal and
ethical standards of our government when it comes to warfare, she should find
out when the United States intends to pay the $16 billion in reparations to
Nicaragua as ordered by the World Court.;    Al Traugott; San Jose  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A defunct petroleum disposal company was
charged Thursday with illegally burning, dumping and storing
hazardous waste, including surplus napalm bombs.
   Prosecutors alleged that a puddle of waste from the company was
so noxious it melted the shoe soles of a passing jogger.
   ``An environmental crime is like a robbery or assault against all
of us,'' said Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who came to town
to announce the first federal felony environmental prosecution in
Utah.
   A 12-count indictment alleges Steven F. Self of Fallbrook,
Calif., and his defunct Ekotek Inc. of knowingly ignoring federal
environmental laws.
   The indictment provides a clear signal ``to environmental
profiteers seeking to improperly cash in on the growing
waste-handling business,'' Thornburgh said.
   The indictment alleges Ekotek ``duped environmentally conscious
businesses into believing that waste materials were being properly
disposed of.''
   The indictment alleges conspiracy to violate the clean air, water
and resources conservation and recovery acts and involves charges
that Self and others illegally burned and discharged solvents, oils,
grease and contaminated runoff, then concealed the violations by
falsifying manifests and logs.
   Self's attorney in Salt Lake City didn't respond to telephone
requests for comment.
   Before Ekotek was shut down by state regulators in October 1987,
residents of nearby homes complained of malodorous smoke coming from
the site.
   Prosecutors said a 17-year-old boy reported his shoe began to
``bubble and disintegrate'' after he accidentally stepped in a
puddle while running by the site.
   Ekotek _ which was in the business of recycling or destroying
waste oil products _ discharged into the public sewer system
approximately 10,000 gallons of wastewater per day, the indictment
said.
   The indictment alleges that in July 1986, Self arranged to accept
two napalm bombs for ``testing, storage and treatment'' from the
Navy Weapons Support Center in Fallbrook and later told state
officials they had been properly disposed of. State explosives
experts had to haul the bombs away the following year.
   Company vice president Steven F. Miller pleaded guilty Wednesday
to three felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal
environmental laws.
   Miller, who agreed to testify against Self and cooperate with
cleanup officials in exchange for his plea, faces up to 13 years in
prison and a fine of up to $750,000. He remains free on his own
recognizance.
   If convicted on all charges, Self and the company may be fined up
to $24 million and Self would face a prison term of up to 45 years.
   Miller's California attorney, Barbara Caulfield, said her client
would not comment before his sentencing July 31.
   The defendants are alleged to have purchased millions of gallons
of oils and solvents and burned them as fuel in a refinery, which
was about three miles from downtown Salt Lake City.
   State Department of Health officials said tens of thousands of
gallons of wastes have leaked or been dumped into the ground and
have contaminated nearby homes.
   Ekotek operated the site from 1981 until October 1987. Peter
Stevenson, the Environmental Protection Agency's on-scene cleanup
coordinator, said agency crews have been stabilizing and evaluating
the site since 1988. It has designated for EPA Superfund cleanup.

<TEXT>     Leaders of the Iraqi insurgency here praised President Bush for warning
Baghdad anew against further use of planes and helicopter gunships in fighting
the uprising. Jalal Talabani, speaking on behalf of the Kurds fighting in the
mountainous north, said Bush's statement had "raised morale and encouraged
people to resist.";    But, charging that Iraqi aircraft were still in action,
he added, "We want the president's words implemented.";    In Sawfan, Iraq,
allied military officials met for a second time with Iraqi officers Sunday and
warned Baghdad against moving its military aircraft within the country.;   
Few details of the meeting were available from military officers in Saudi
Arabia. But Secretary of State James Baker, speaking in Washington, said that
the United States had rejected an Iraqi request for permission to "reposition"
its fixed-wing military aircraft, an action that could make it easier for the
Iraqi military to defeat the rebels.;    Baker, speaking on ABC's "This Week
With David Brinkley," said the restriction on the warplanes was intended only
as a security measure to protect the cease-fire agreement. While acknowledging
that the ban had a "collateral effect" of reducing the ability of Saddam's
forces to fight the uprising, and that the United States would like to see
Saddam replaced, he said that was not its goal.;    As Iraq continued to claim
the upper hand against the insurgency, which broke out after the government
was defeated by the U.S.-led coalition in the Persian Gulf war, Baghdad radio
said Sunday that the National Assembly will meet in special session on
Wednesday.;    No agenda was given, the Associated Press reported. But Saddam,
in a televised address Saturday, promised broad political reforms that he said
would transform his totalitarian regime into a multiparty democracy, and there
was speculation that the rubber-stamp National Assembly was being summoned for
this purpose.;    Baghdad radio also said that Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman
of Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council, had met with army commanders
and with Kurdish tribal chiefs in Tamim province in the north and received
pledges of loyalty to Saddam from the chiefs. The report did not say where the
meeting was held, but Kurdish rebel leaders outside Iraq have said they
control the outskirts of Kirkuk, the province's capital.;    The Iraqi
newspapers reported "death, destruction, chaos and looting beyond
description," in their first detailed accounts of the uprising in the
predominantly Shiite Muslim south. They said hundreds of bodies, some of them
mutilated beyond identification, had been left in the streets in Karbala, one
of two Shiite holy cities, and nearby Hilla.;    Al Thawra, the newspaper of
the ruling Baath Party, said devastation in Karbala was immense, and it blamed
rioters for the violence. The newspaper quoted the local governor, Ghazi
Mohammed, as saying that government offices, party headquarters, banks, police
stations and civil defense offices had been destroyed, Reuters news service
reported from Baghdad, and said dozens of people were killed when rioters
attacked the city's main hospital.;    The newspaper said rioters had used
heavy artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades in Hilla and destroyed
most of the city's hospitals and clinics. Al Thawra and Al Qadissiyah, the
Defense Ministry newspaper, both carried pictures showing bodies, including
that of a child, as well as damaged public buildings, Reuters reported. The
papers said rebels held Hilla and Karbala for nine days.;    There was no
independent confirmation of charges here by Jawad Mohammed Malki, a spokesman
for the Shiite fundamentalist Dawa party, that the Iraqi military used napalm
against civilians traveling along the highway connecting Karbala and Najaf,
the two Shiite shrine cities. Malki said "thousands of women and children"
were burned to death and their "bodies are still strewn on the ground.";   
Iran's official IRNA news agency quoted World Health Organization Director
General Hiroshi Nakajima, who was visiting Tehran, as saying that he had seen
refugee children "whose faces were burned by napalm.";    In the fighting in
northern Iraq, Kurdish sources said Massoud Rajavi's Mujahedeen Khalq, an
Iranian exile force long financed by Iraq and much in favor in Washington
during the Reagan administration, was fighting alongside government troops.
They were reported to be 3,000 strong and equipped with 70 tanks and armored
vehicles.;    Kurdish sources charged that Iraqi helicopters and light planes
had dropped white phosphorous and napalm on insurgents and civilians in
Kirkuk, an important oil city in the north, and its large Arab population was
said to be fleeing.;    Meanwhile, in Washington, Secretary of the Army
Michael Stone said U.S. forces will remain in the Persian Gulf beyond the July
4 date set by Bush as "a special day of celebration for our returning troops."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     After being ahead 44, the Dow ended the day off 2.47 at 2,889.36, putting
the loss for the week at 45.29, or 1.5 percent.;    What touched off the
flurry was a report that U.S. warplanes had dropped napalm on Iraqi front
lines.;    It was later confirmed that napalm had been dumped into oil-filled
trenches in front of enemy lines to try to burn off the oil.;    "The market's
falling out of bed," one Wall Street analyst remarked. "People want out over
the weekend as a protective measure.";    Other stock averages showed little
change, suggesting the weakness was largely in blue chips.;    The broader
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended at 365.65, up less than a point for the day.
The NASDAQ and Amex composites both gained slightly.;    New York Stock
Exchange volume rose to 218.8 million shares from 180.8 million Thursday.;   
Showing that traders were indecisive, 820 Big Board stocks advanced, while 715
declined.;    Even so, no stock dropped to a new low -- the first time that
has happened in several years -- while 104 rose to new highs.;    One of the
new highs was General Mills, which reached 54 3/4 before falling to 53 1/4, up
1 1/4.;    The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond closed unchanged from
Thursday, with its yield remaining at 8.06 percent.;    Among the 30 Dow
industrials, IBM slid 2 1/4 to 133 1/4, in heavy trading. International Paper,
one of several paper companies downgraded by Richard Schneider of Kidder,
Peabody, fell 1 3/8 to 62 3/8.;    Despite the drop in IBM, other
high-technology stocks fared well.;    Microsoft rose 2 1/4 to 102 1/4; Adobe
Systems, 2 to 47 1/2; and Shared Medical Systems, 1 to 18 1/8.;    Applied
Materials, which will triple the size of its Japanese semiconductor factory,

after it and Hewlett-Packard said they would announce a joint development deal
Monday.;    H-P rose 1/8 to 47 3/8.;    Amgen rose 6 1/4 to 101 3/4, after
setting higher-than-expected prices on a chemotherapy drug, prompting analysts

<TEXT>     "They are butchering people by the hundreds -- using artillery, helicopter
gunships," said Sgt. Jim Parker of the 82nd Airborne, referring to Republican
Guard troops who remain loyal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "This is as
close to hell as you can get.";    Refugees estimated that about 5,000 bodies
were on the streets of the southern city of Basra, and Iran's official
government radio reported that thousands of civilians had been killed along
the road between Karbala and Najaf.;    After a two-week media blackout on the
rebellion, Saddam's embattled government has launched a campaign to turn
public opinion against the insurgents.;    "It was all blood, blood, blood,"
said a story Monday in Iraq's government newspaper. Baghdad dailies splashed
photos and stories of the burgeoning civil war across their front pages.;   
"The barbarism and brutality of the U.S. aggression against Iraq was not
isolated from all the crimes that took place after the cease-fire at the hands
of mobs, agents and outlaws," declared the military newspaper Al Qadissiya,
blaming the allied victors in the Persian Gulf war for inciting insurrection.;
   Saturday, Saddam himself, speaking publicly for the first time since the
100-hour ground war, put the blame on Iran, which he accused of stirring
Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq to rise against the Baghdad government.;   
Iraq's apparent inability to quickly crush the revolt emboldened some of
Saddam's opponents to predict Monday that his downfall was all but assured.;  
 "Saddam's days in power are numbered. He will be removed very shortly,"
Hassan Nakib, a former Iraqi Army general and leader of one of the exiled
opposition groups, said in Damascus, Syria.;    Nakib said tens of thousands
of Iraqi soldiers had switched sides in the battle. The rebels, he maintained,
now control most Iraqi cities and towns.;    Iran's ranking cleric also
declared that Saddam would soon fall.;    The Iranian radio said Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's religious leader, told a group of visiting Palestinian and
Lebanese leaders in Tehran on Monday that the Saddam government could not
endure for long "because of the arms that have fallen into the hands of the
people.";    What Saddam's regime has not yet been able to put down by force,
the Iraqi president apparently has decided, will be attacked with a propaganda
barrage as well.;    A reporter for the government daily Al Jumhuriyah was
dispatched to the key southern city of Karbala, revered by the Shiite sect as
the burial place of its earliest imams, or religious leaders.;    Like other
correspondents for the government press, Jumhuriyah's man said rebels had
rampaged through the city, killing innocents and destroying property. Bodies
were stacked in Karbala's hospitals, he wrote. "Blood was painted on the
streets and the walls of the city. It was all blood, blood, blood.";    Al
Thawra, the newspaper of Hussein's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, said the
insurgency in the south was meant to destroy Iraq and "turn it into another
Lebanon.";    Saddam's government insisted that the rebellion in the south was
ethnically based on the Shiite majority there and was being stirred up and
agitated by the Shiite regime in neighboring Iran. Ayatollah Khamenei
reinforced the relationship when he declared a day of mourning in Iran for
"the massacre of Iraq's defenseless people by the Baathist criminals.";    In
Safwan, near the Kuwait border, refugees described increasingly violent
fighting.;    "We saw children with burns like holes in their feet, and we
were told it was napalm," said Jamal Rifai, 45, a Kuwaiti citizen recently
released by rebels from a prison in Kerbala. "It had burned through the skin.
We had heard it had been used in Basra and Najaf.";    Saddam "is burning the
bodies," said Raad Hasem, a 38-year-old farmer, en route from Safwan to Basra
to sell his tomatoes. "The bombs dropped from the helicopters, and the bodies
burned quickly.";    "We were eating animal feed before we left," said Sahid
Shaban, an Egyptian mechanic who fled Basra on Monday and arrived in
allied-controlled territory near Kuwait. "We would grind it up and eat it with
sea water.";    Shaban, who had lived in Basra for nine years, said the city
was "full of bodies. Dogs are eating them everywhere. There is no food, no
water.";    In addition to the Shiite rebellion in the south, Kurdish
guerrillas are waging their own battle with the Baghdad government in the
north.  </TEXT>

   Air force planes and helicopters
firebombed and strafed residential areas near Jaffna Fort, a
strategic military garrison, and hundreds of buildings were ablaze,
Tamil rebels said Tuesday.
   Authorities and witnesses reported the deaths of 196 people
nationwide, bringing the death toll in two weeks of fighting to
1,626 combatants. Many civilians have also been killed.
   In the northern city of Jaffna, the rebel stronghold, the
government used bombers and a helicopter gunship to pound
residential areas around Jaffna Fort, in which 270 soldiers and
policemen have been besieged since the fighting began.
   Five air force bombers and a helicopter gunship used 120-pound
bombs and 66-pound incendiary devices in the attack, said a rebel
statement telexed to newspaper and news agency offices in Colombo.
   It described attacks on Monday and said hundreds of buildings
near Jaffna Fort were set on fire. ``The whole area is ablaze,'' it
said.
   Military officials said Tuesday that air force planes continued
to bomb and strafe rebel positions and were trying to avoid
civilian targets in the city, 186 miles north of Colombo.
   ``We are not hellbent on bombing and killing people,'' Defense
Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunge said.
   There was no way to independently verify rebel or government
claims because transportation and telephone services to the region
were cut off.
   But travelers reaching Vavuniya, just south of Jaffna, confirmed
that the Jaffna was being heavily bombed.
   Over the weekend, air force planes dropped leaflets warning the
city's 120,000 residents to evacuate.
   The rebel statement claimed the military was using ``napalm''
bombs but then said the bombs were made of coal tar, rubber
shavings and explosives. There was no indication that napalm, a
powerful defoliant, was used by the military.
   The government considers Jaffna Fort one of its main bases in
the area and it would be a serious military blow if it lost the
area to the rebels.
   The Tamils started a war for separatism in 1983 but there had
been a 13-month halt to hostilities during a cease-fire between the
rebels and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The latest fighting broke out on June 11, after a Tamil man
claimed he was manhandled by Sinhalese police. Tamil Tigers then
overran a series of police stations.
   Tamils form 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. They
have long accused the Sinhalese majority of discrimination.

N'dalatando, the provincial capital, was again rocked by violent 
clashes this morning. N'dalatando has become a kind of 
laboratory in which the destructive power of [word indistinct] 
weapons is tested, but the fighting is taking a break at this 
stage. 
  In clashes this morning the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] dropped 
internationally forbidden bombs containing phosphine, a toxic 
product, in addition to napalm and phosphorus bombs. The 
shelling was backed by two PC-7 aircraft, which carried out 13 
air raids. Firmino Lucamba reports: 
  [Begin Lucamba recording] The fighting is continuing in the 
center of the city and it is so fierce it can be compared to the 
fighting during the Second World War. The MPLA-PT (?threw 
everything) [words indistinct] at this stage. What worries the 
local military command most is the fact that the MPLA-PT is 
underhandedly using internationally forbidden weapons such as 
napalm, toxic and phosphorus bombs, as well as (?other types) 
yet to be discovered. The use of those weapons has been 
affecting the people of N'dalatando at large, and pregnant women 
and children in particular. These women and children have been 
receiving treatment at the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola, UNITA, hospital. [passage omitted] [end

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (15): 'We've nothing
to hide' - Profile, Dow Chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A crisp April morning, under a clear blue sky, Midland Michigan seems
like the most pristine place on earth. Walking past the daffodils and
crocuses in Dow Gardens, just down the road from the Dow-funded arts centre,
it is hard to believe that one of the world's biggest chemical plants is
just a mile away.
Spring is a good time to visit Midland. In the summer, when the central
valley location causes an inversion of the humid air, Dow's presence in
Midland can seem less benign. 'I was born in Midland but I moved away a few
years ago because of the smell,' says a 36-year-old gas station attendant in
a nearby town. 'In the summer, we kept the doors and windows shut all the
time.'
But it was not just the smell of Midland that convinced Dow it had to do
something about the environment. 'In the mid-1980s, we were asked to look at
public perception of the chemical industry,' says Mr Ron Pingel, Dow's
director of environmental affairs and responsible care. 'After polling the
public, chemical company employees and Dow employees, we found a huge gap
between how the industry perceived itself and how the public perceived the
industry. We realised we had to do something.'
That something included improving its notoriously combative relationship
with the Environmental Protection Agency, which had reached a nadir in 1985
when Dow went to the Supreme Court, charging the agency with violating its
privacy after the EPA took aerial photographs of the Midland plant during an
air pollution investigation.
The company's public relations problem was made doubly difficult by its
reputation from the 1960s, when Dow was the maker of napalm and Agent Orange
used in Vietnam.
Dow's efforts to embrace its former adversaries extend beyond co-operating
with the EPA and meeting the guidelines of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association's responsible care programme. Dow established a board of outside
specialists in 1991 to guide its environmental policy, giving it access to
confidential documents and information. Dow has also initiated a number of
internal programmes to convince itself, and the public, that Dow is serious
about the environment.
Like other big chemical companies, Dow has cut its toxic emissions
substantially in recent years. The company says the greatest decline was in
the 1970s, before the figures were made public. In the US, the company says
its air emissions, as required by the Toxic Relief Inventory, have dropped
from 10,893 tonnes in 1989 to 8,212 tonnes in 1991. By 1995, Dow expects its
emissions to be closer to 5,000 tonnes.
Signs of Dow's greener face are scattered throughout corporate headquarters,
from the recycling bins in the dining room and offices to the memo pads
embossed with the Responsible Care logo.
When the CMA introduced Responsible Care in 1988, it was quickly endorsed by
Dow's senior management who realised the company needed to improve its
image. At the operating level Responsible Care met with less enthusiasm.
'When it was first mentioned to local plant managers, fear was in their
eyes,' says Mr Dave Buzzelli, Dow's vice president for environment, health
and safety.
Dow's waste reduction efforts centre on its WRAP (Waste Reduction Always
Pays) programme. The WRAP goals include reducing waste to the environment,
recognising employee efforts to cut waste, encouraging employees to think
about reducing waste at its source and measuring and tracking progress. The
company says many WRAP projects help save fuel, raw materials and
environmental costs.
'Instead of asking a group of environmental experts, we ask the business
teams to come up with ideas,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'For most business people in
the US, the environment has always been seen as a peripheral. We're trying
to change that so our business managers make decisions about products.'
Nevertheless, the overall cost component of Responsible Care is significant.
Dow's environmental, health and safety operating expenses were Dollars 600m
in 1992, including Dollars 200m for environmental capital investments. It
hopes the investment will pay off in the long run by reducing environmental
clean-up costs.
Perhaps the biggest change at Dow has been its efforts to open its
facilities to local communities. 'We're opening the gates to the public
because what you can't see, you imagine and what you imagine, you often
fear,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'We're showing that the company has nothing to
hide.'
The company has set up local community advisory panels to encourage dialogue
with its neighbours. 'Dow has been more than willing to discuss our
concerns, whether they are business concerns or environmental,' says Mr
Shirley Clowers, president of Midland's Chamber of Commerce and a local
panel member.
Others on the panel are more sceptical. Ms Mary Sinclair, a Midland
environmentalist and long a critic of Dow, says: 'Mostly, people tend to
just sit back and let Dow tell them what it wants to tell them. Dow did a
very good job of getting a cross-section of people for the panel, but it's a
company town.'
Ms Sinclair is frustrated by Dow's decision to burn dioxins in Midland in
spite of the concentrations of the highly toxic chemical in the region's
soil and recent findings by the EPA that dioxin may be more dangerous than
previously thought.
'I'm able to get information out to the community through the panel. When we
discussed siting an incinerator in the community, Dow didn't want to do any
explaining of the environmental issues. I was the one who had to bring up
the issues.'
Ms Sinclair is also worried about Dow's refusal to endorse an air quality
report by the International Joint Commission, a US and Canadian group which
advises governments of both countries. The latest report recommends that
incineration facilities in the region be phased out or required to eliminate
the production and emission of dioxins and other toxins.
Dow has also been criticised by local environmental groups for fighting
Right-to-Know legislation. Ms Tracy Easthope of the Ann Arbor Ecology
Center's toxics reduction project says: 'Dow may be one of the more
progressive companies, and some of the quotes from the chief executive and
Dow officials are impressive. But they need to act on their words.'
Other environmentalists have criticised Dow's methods of measuring waste
reduction, noting that incinerated material is not part of the toxics
release inventory which Dow uses to make claims of reduced waste. 'What Dow
has done is essentially to transfer where the waste goes, so that it has
reduced the amount of dioxin in the water through filtration but the sludges
from filtration either end up in a landfill or get incinerated. It goes
somewhere,' says one critic.
Dow's executives are not oblivious to these issues. 'Chemicals by their
nature are reactive so they all have some degree of hazard,' says Mr Pingel.
'We live here too. We use these products. The debate is our debate. I
believe we can research, manufacture, develop and sell chemicals in ways
that don't expose people to undue risk.'

<P>
Your informative and humane editorial on chemical weapons ("To the Brink: What 
an Ugly War," Aug. 9) contained a serious omission. During our mistaken 
involvement in Vietnam, we used huge amounts of napalm and Agent Orange, both 
of which figure clearly as chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering this distressing page from our recent past puts a peculiarly ironic 
and significant twist on your entirely appropriate conclusion that "History's 
pigeons have a way of coming home to roost." 
</P>
<P>
We are known to have been manufacturing chemical and biological weapons since 
our withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Clean hands are a condition of our 
credibility if, as most Americans hope, we provide leadership in the world for 
outlawing the use of these cruel and savage instruments of destruction.

<TEXT>     Although help is on the way, the Kurds understandably feel betrayed. The
United States and the European Community were there before the rebellion,
pummeling Saddam and encouraging revolt.;    Now that Saddam has again
massacred Kurds, the Western powers are there with aid. But where were they
when the bullets, the bombs and the napalm were raining down?;    If only it
were that simple.;    The United Nations resolutions against Iraq authorized
force to liberate Kuwait. That was done, with gusto. The allies used more
force than necessary to accomplish the narrow goal. Iraq's -- meaning Saddam's
-- military was crushed for any international purpose.;    In Saddam's defeat,
Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south thought they saw their chance to
remove a brutal dictator.;    They misjudged. Saddam's remaining forces were
plenty to crush the rebellion. Lacking a U.N. mandate and torn between the two
principles of national sovereignty and human rights, the United States and the
Europeans stood by.;    We thought President Bush was right to resist
intervening militarily to support the Kurds, even though he had been careless
in inciting them to revolt.;    Now, with the Kurds staggering, the principle
is simpler. Aid to refugees is less problematic than aid to armed rebels. This
may be the most we should do, but it is also the least we can do.;    Any
assertion from Saddam that the camps violate Iraq's sovereignty should be
rejected. Saddam's massacre of Kurds has gone far beyond suppressing an armed
rebellion; it approaches genocide. International law permits intervention to
stop it.;    The latest horrors -- napalm and machine-gunning refugees from
helicopters -- are terrible reminders of the poison-gas massacre of 5,000
Kurds in 1988. Kurds cannot be expected to believe promises of amnesty from
Saddam.;    As solutions born of desperation usually do, the havens will
create difficulties. Will they become crowded refugee camps that seem to exist
indefinitely and condemn their inhabitants to years of limbo, like Gaza or
camps in Thailand? What if Iraq attacks them as sources of insurrection with
the country?;    Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, who may die
from the elements or by Saddam's hand, can't wait for answers. Help now;
figure it out later.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Tigrean Rebels Claim Ethiopians Kill 600 In Air Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tigrean rebels have claimed that Ethiopian
warplanes killed more than 600 civilians in air raids on an ancient
market town during the government's two-month-old counteroffensive.
   The guerrillas said Tuesday that the strikes by four MiG fighter
bombers and two Mi-24 helicopter gunships were unleashed on
Wednesday, June 22 in Hauzien, 340 miles north of Addis Ababa, the
capital.
   Wednesday is market day in Hauzien and hundreds of peasants are
traditionally drawn to the town.
   The attack wounded more than 360 people and killed hundreds of
animals, said the rebel communique, sent to The Associated Press
from the Tigre People's Liberation Front information center in
London,
   There was no way to independently verify the claim. The
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam rarely comments on
rebel claims, and both sides often exaggerate reports on the war in
northern Ethiopia.
   The communique said much of the town was razed in a six-hour
bombardment.
   ``Most of the buildings _ over 500 including nine stores and 15
shops, the town mosque and the only school _ were completely
destroyed,'' said the rebel report.
   They claimed the Ethiopian government uses rockets and napalm,
phosphorous and cluster bombs in attacks on numerous Tigrean towns.
   Western diplomats based in Addis Ababa say they have heard of
the government using cluster bombs, but not napalm.
   ``The Dergue (government) is committing these atrocities in a
region suffering from starvation,'' the rebels said.
   The U.S. Government and diplomats from other Western countries
have condemned a government counteroffensive begun in May that has
crippled relief operations and jeopardized the lives of 3.2 million
people threatened by starvation from drought in the neighboring
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   The war zone is the most severely affected by a drought that
plagues more than 7 million Ethiopians.
   But diplomats similarly accuse the rebels of pursuing military
objectives with no regard for drought victims. The rebels launched
their offensive at the end of last year after the United Nations
warned of impending famine in the region. Rebels won major
victories in March, capturing several towns and forcing government
troops to withdraw from others.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies when, with a clique of army
officers, he helped overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.
   Both the government and rebels are Marxist. Eritrean
secessionists took up arms 27 years ago and are fighting Africa's
oldest civil war. Tigrean rebels went to war 14 years ago demanding
more autonomy.

   Captors holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon are
motivated by a personal vengeance that will be more difficult to
overcome since Israel kidnapped a Moslem cleric, says a U.S. Moslem
leader who claims to have met with the hostage-holders in Beirut.
   Mohammed Mehdi, secretary-general of the National Council on
Islamic Affairs, said Thursday the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid worsened the prospects that the ``exceptionally bitter,
exceptionally paranoid'' kidnappers will free the hostages.
   ``They feel the right to retaliation is sacred, and any
questioning of that is illegitimate,'' said Mehdi, who claims to be
possibly the only person in the United States who has met with the
kidnappers in Beirut.
   Obeid _ who is affiliated with Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian
extremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders _ was abducted
from his home in south Lebanon July 28 by Israeli commandos. Israel,
saying Obeid was involved in terrorism, has refused to free him.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
July 31 it retaliated by hanging U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, who was abducted while on U.N. duty in Lebanon. U.S.
officials said they believe Higgins was killed, but some reports say
the killing occurred months earlier.
   Joseph Cicippio, one of the seven other U.S. hostages, was
threatened with death, then given a reprieve.
   Mehdi claims to have met with people responsible for holding
Cicippio and Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, during a February 1987 visit to Beirut to
appeal for the hostages' release.
   He said he was led blindfolded to the meeting in a dimly lighted
room in Beirut. The captors he met with _ four men ranging in age
from about 20 to 25 _ bore personal scars from the fighting in
Lebanon, Mehdi said.
   The man who claimed to be in charge of holding Anderson, the
longest-held hostage who was kidnapped in 1985, said his entire
village was destroyed by U.S. bombs dropped in retaliation for the
bombing of the U.S. Marines' headquarters in Lebanon, when 241
servicemen were killed.
   ``He is so damn bitter he is ready to drop such shells on New
York, on Washington,'' Mehdi said of Anderson's captor, who lost his
wife, children and grandparents when his village was bombed.
   The captor responsible for holding Cicippio, who was kidnapped in
September 1986, told Mehdi his children had been burned by American
napalm dropped from an American-made airplane piloted by an Israeli.
Three of the captor's five children died, Mehdi said.
   What Mehdi was told in Lebanon, however, does not entirely match
previous accounts of the kidnappers or events surrounding the
abductions.
   The man holding Anderson has been described as a 38-year-old
Lebanese Shiite, Imad Mugihniyah, who is driven by a desire to free
relatives held in Kuwait for attacks on U.S. and French facilities
there.
   There was one U.S. bombing run following the destruction of the
Marine headquarters and it was not reported to have destroyed any
villages.
   In the case of Cicippio, Israeli sources knowledgeable about
Israel's war in Lebanon say Israeli planes used napalm in a few
cases against strictly military targets belonging to Syria.
   Mehdi said that although Americans consider the kidnappers to be
terrorists, the kidnappers perceive themselves differently.
   ``They said, `We are taking care of these people. Is this
terrorism, or is the burning of our children terrorism?'''
   Mehdi said his attempts to persuade the kidnappers that their
actions violated Islamic law, that the taking of innocent hostages
was contrary to the faith's teachings on personal forgiveness and
individual responsibility, were ``a dead road.''
   Mehdi, who is seeking a meeting with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, said the U.S. should pressure Israel to release Obeid to
start ``a chain of events to secure the release of the hostages.''
   ``Sheik Obeid, to his group in southern Lebanon, is like the
pope. And you do not kidnap the pope,'' said Mehdi. ``Colonel
Higgins was a victim of this.''
   The United States also should start trying to understand the
suffering that caused the kidnappers to take hostages, Mehdi said.
   ``People are not born terrorists. Circumstances make them take
such violent actions. If we don't bother to examine those
circumstances, we will be denying ourselves the opportunity to solve
a problem,'' Mehdi said.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas appear not to be
gaining any ground in their siege of Jalalabad, and diplomatic
sources say the insurgents' Pakistani backers had been deeply
divided on whether to mount the offensive.
   The guerrillas battled government forces in four provinces on
Sunday and fired rockets into Kabul, the capital, the government
said. Nearly 280 people were reported killed in the fighting,
including 12 in Kabul, it said.
   The guerrillas, meanwhile, claimed Soviet aircraft were dropping
napalm on insurgent positions and said 300 government troops
defected to the guerrillas on Saturday.
   In neighboring Pakistan, a Foreign Ministry official denied a
report in Sunday's editions of The New York Times that Pakistan
directs the guerrillas' operations and had ordered them to attack
Jalalabad.
   The city is 40 miles west of Pakistan, where most Afghan
guerrillas are based, and 75 miles east of Kabul.
   Pakistan ordered the attack on Jalalabad following a March 5
meeting attended by U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley, The Times quoted
a Pakistani participant and other officials as saying. Jalalabad
was attacked March 6.
   Oakley's office on Sunday referred all questions to Kent Obee,
chief of the U.S. Information Service in Islamabad. Obee refused
comment.
   ``There is no truth in the report,'' said a senior diplomat in
the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Afghans ... are very independent people. They do not take
orders from anyone regarding their own affairs, much less about the
conduct of fighting in their country,'' the official said.
   But diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there were deep divisions within Pakistan's military and government
on whether the guerrillas should have tried to take the city, which
government troops have successfully defended.
   The diplomats said up to 8,000 guerrillas have died in the
battle for Jalalabad, compared to 2,000 government soldiers.
   One diplomat termed the offensive a ``suicide mission.'' He said
there were 12,000 guerrillas around the city, compared with 20,000
government soldiers. The Times reported that no Afghans were
present at the March 5 meeting of senior Pakistani military and
civilian officials. Guerrilla sources said Sunday they were unaware
of any such meeting.
   Pakistan is headquarters for a seven-party guerrilla alliance
and its Inter Services Intelligence agency has distributed billions
of dollars in U.S. military aid to the insurgents over the past
decade.
   The guerrillas began fighting after Marxists took control of the
Afghan government in a 1978 coup. Soviets troops intervened a year
later and stayed for nine years to prop up the communists.
   Shortly after Soviet forces completed their withdrawal on Feb.
15, several rebel commanders said Jalalabad would be their first
offensive.
   President Najib of Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan
of violating the U.N.-sponsored accord that led the way for the
Soviet withdrawal.
   Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai, in remarks released Sunday,
said: ``The Pakistani side should keep in mind that its soil will
come to lie under Afghanistan's rocket strikes.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said at least 265 people were
killed _ most of them guerrillas _ and 123 injured Sunday in
Jalalabad, Khost, Kandahar and Herat. At least 12 people died in
rocket attacks in northern Kabul, official Radio Kabul reported.
   The claims could not be independently verified.
   Heavy fighting in Jalalabad, Khost and Kandahar also was
reported by the guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency in Islamabad,
Pakistan, although it gave no casualties.
   The agency did claim today that Soviet aircraft were dropping
napalm and other bombs on guerrilla positions in the Afghan
province of Badakshan. It said there were heavy civilian losses.
   Guerrillas previously have reported the use of Soviet and Indian
pilots by Afghanistan. Kabul, Moscow and New Delhi all have denied
the charges.
   The guerrilla leaders also claimed that two regiments comprising
300 men of the Afghan army defected to the guerrillas with a large
quantity of arms in northwestern Badghis province on Saturday.
   The agency also said guerrillas Friday attacked the large Bagram
Afghan air force base, about 30 miles north of Kabul, killing 25
government soldiers.

AIR FORCE CHIEF FIRED FOR REMARKS ON IRAQ STRIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Dugan was fired for candor, for saying in public what is evidently said at 
the White House and Pentagon in private. I find this approach to Dugan 
stupefying because his nonsensical ideas were his real problem, not his candor. 
</P>
<P>
Crudely put, he argued that the U.S. military lost the Vietnam War because it 
was constrained in its use of air power. If these constraints were lifted in a 
war against Iraq, the U.S. military could this time obtain a quick and decisive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Gen. Dugan has time on his hands, I suggest he re-learn the history of 
the Vietnam War. His military colleagues, as well as those in the White House, 
Congress and the press could also benefit from the same lessons. 
</P>
<P>
In order to "bomb them back to the Stone Age," the U.S. government relied 
heavily and ineffectively on massive aerial bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia. 
Facing outmoded air defenses, it engaged in carpet bombing of North Vietnam and 
totally destroyed rural agriculture in Cambodia. Furthermore, air power was 
also used for napalm, Agent Orange and cluster bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy not only failed, it backfired. More than 3,000 planes were shot 
down and more than 500 surviving crew members captured. Nevertheless, the 
resolve of the Vietnamese was hardened and the chaos we created in Cambodia 
brought the Khmer Rouge to power. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan is now gone, but Washington's other born-again hawks ought to mull over 
this history before they so eagerly march more young men and women off to war.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American allegations that Iraq is using
outlawed chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels have touched off a
wave of anti-Americanism in Iraq.
   But although the conflict may damage U.S.-Iraqi relations, there
appears little likelihood of a return to the bitter hostility that
made Iraq a leading foe of U.S. Middle East policies in the 1970s.
   The U.S. Senate on Sept. 9 accused Iraq of using poison gas in a
campaign of ``genocide'' against its autonomy-seeking Kurdish
minority.
   The State Department said it had proof of Iraqi poison gas
attacks, based on American examination of Kurdish refugees in
Turkey. Britain also condemned Baghdad, citing ``compelling
evidence'' provided by Washington.
   The Senate demanded economic sanctions against Iraq, which is
struggling to cope with a foreign debt estimated at $70 billion
incurred during its 8-year war with Iran.
   Iraq denies the gas allegations and has responded with a wave of
fierce anti-American rhetoric. Its state-controlled newspapers and
broadcasts have branded the Senate the ``American Knesset,'' a
reference to Israel's parliament, and claimed it seeks to help
Israel by weakening a powerful Arab country.
   The Iraqis organized a march by 20,000 people past the U.S.
Embassy. Many chanted slogans in English denouncing alleged
American human rights abuses.
   Questioning America's right to preach, Iraqi television screened
an hour-long documentary depicting the 1945 atomic bombing of
Hiroshima.
   It also showed Vietnamese children with napalm burns and
Palestinian victims of Israeli attacks as well as film of rats
crawling over homeless Americans sleeping in New York City sewers.
   The anti-American propaganda is the strongest since the United
States and Iraq resumed diplomatic ties in 1984 after a 17-year
break caused by U.S. support of Israel in the 1967 war with the
Arabs.
   Today, Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz said future relations with
Washington depend on whether the U.S. adminstration agrees to the
Senate calls for sanctions against Iraq.
   ``If the American adminstration yields to the campaign of the
Senate and the Zionist lobby, this will have negative effect on
relations between the two countries,'' Aziz told reporters in
Baghdad.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon told The Associated Press
last week that Iraq's response did not indicate any shift in its
basic orientation.
   But, he added, ``If the (U.S.) policy continues, if the tension
continues, obviously trade opportunities and other matters ...
would be in jeopardy.''
   Diplomats in Baghdad said they expected the burst of rhetoric to
pass if the chemical weapons charges do not continue.
   Iraq badly needs Western, if not American, credit to help
rebuild its war-battered country and reward its weary population
with consumer goods.
   It also seeks diplomatic support in its negotiating struggles
with Iran at peace talks in Geneva.
   U.S. relations with Iraq improved gradually during the Persian
Gulf war, aided by Iraq's growing ties with pro-Western states in
the region and U.S. hostility toward Iran's Islamic fundamentalist
government.
   Iraq also appreciated U.S. naval intervention in the gulf to
protect its Arab neighbors' shipping from Iranian attacks.
   But the Iraqis remain deeply suspicious of the United States and
sensitive about signs that foreign countries are tilting toward
Iran in the postwar era.
   Iran's size, oil wealth and position on the southern Soviet
flank have made it a focus of Western diplomacy for decades, and
Tehran's more pragmatic leaders are seeking to end the country's
self-imposed isolation.
   But Iraq, too, is a strategic country. Its oil reserves are
second only to those of Saudi Arabia, it flanks NATO member Turkey
and it is argued that Iraq's war with Iran blocked the expansion of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic crusade.
   Iraqi leaders claim the Western allegations of chemical warfare
are designed to help both Israel and Iran.
   Their suspicions are rooted partly in Israeli and American
efforts to aid Iran during the war and by strong U.S.
identification with Israel, which regards Iraq, with a
million-strong battle-hardened army, as a major potential threat.
   Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear plant in June 1981 to prevent the
possible development of an Arab atomic bomb.
   Baghdad expressed skepticism about the timing of U.S. actions.
During the war with Iran, Iraq said it used chemical weapons after
Iran used them first. Iraq drew United Natons condemnation, but no
sanctions.
   Both Turkey and the Red Cross say they have been unable to
substantiate the gas charges that drew the latest U.S. criticism.
   And diplomats critical of Iraq's treatment of the Kurds refuse,
even in private, to characterize it as genocide.
   They said the Iraqis, who lost hundreds of thousands of
casualties to conventional arms in the war, have trouble
understanding the West's reaction to chemical warfare charges.
   The crisis has rallied Arabs behind Iraq. Kuwait's Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday summoned U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Wilson
Howell to express ``extreme concern'' over the U.S. charges, an
official statement said.
   It reported that Foreign undersecretary Suleiman Majed
Al-Shaheen told Howell: ``Kuwait regrets the way the American media
exploited such allegations to launch a campaign against Iraq at a
time when neutral parties ... announced they did not find evidence
that Iraq has used chemical weapons.''
   It added that Kuwait ``believes that invoking such questions by
the U.S. Senate will only ... undermine the chances of concluding a
comprehensive peace agreement'' between Iran and Iraq.

<LEADPARA>  The U.S.-led ground campaign opened across multiple fronts Saturday, closely
tracking the Pentagon's battle plan calling for a stunning mix of speed and
firepower from several directions to isolate and, if necessary, destroy the
Iraqi forces.;    If all goes according to plan, the campaign will be wrapped
up in days or weeks, with U.S. deaths in the hundreds, one defense official
said. But experienced military analysts outside the Pentagon have said the war
could drag on for more than a month and kill thousands of Americans.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Because the Iraqi military has long relied on orders issued from
headquarters, Pentagon officials believe that the allies' shredding of Iraq's
command and control network during 38 days of bombing will dramatically
shorten the war: "If they can't communicate, they can't coordinate," one Army
officer said. "That means there won't be one big war but a lot of little
ones.";    U.S. war planners have spent the past seven months retooling their
war plan, which was originally designed for the defense of Europe, for
retaking Kuwait.;    "A considerable additional amount of violence is
available to the commander should it be decided to use that violence," Army
Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said Saturday before the ground war began. "If the ground attack
occurs, there will be no doubt in anybody's mind -- especially in the minds of
the Iraqi soldiers -- that it has occurred.";    Details kept secret;  Even
after the ground war got under way, details remained a closely held secret.
But the broad outlines have become increasingly clear as 735,000 troops from
28 nations moved into position to battle the approximately 500,000 Iraqi
troops dug into Kuwait and southern Iraq.;    At the western edge of the
battle zone, allied forces have probably lunged directly into Iraq from Saudi
Arabia to seal off Iraqi troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq, including the
vaunted Republican Guard. Once the allied forces sever the Iraqis'
communications and supply lines, they will move south and attack the trapped
Iraqi troops from the rear, where the Iraqis' extensive earthwork
fortifications would be worthless.;    On the eastern side of the war zone, in
the northern Persian Gulf, about 18,000 Marines aboard 31 vessels are expected
to hit Kuwaiti beaches and quickly seek to liberate Kuwait City, the capital
of the occupied country. The leathernecks will come ashore aboard landing
ships, land-sea vehicles that hover on a layer of air, and helicopters.;   
Between those two potential fronts, on either side of where the borders of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq meet, U.S. armored units have breached the broad
mine fields, oil-filled moats, razor wire and sand berms at at least two
points, defense officials said.;    U.S. Army M-1 tanks began slashing through
the berms early Saturday, preparing paths for thousands of allied troops to
pour through in additional tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Above, Marine
AV-8 Harrier jets dropped 500-pound napalm bombs into the oil-filled moats
along the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, seeking to drain or exhaust the moats' fuel
before an allied attack.;    Engineers in lead;  At the tip of the allied
spear Saturday were Army combat engineers, clad in bulky chemical protective
suits, stretching portable bridges across moats and trenches. Explosive
charges and rakes and rollers pushed by tanks were used to detonate mines that
survived allied bombing meant to destroy them.;    U.S. officials have played
down the significance of Iraq's chemical weapons capability, except to hint
that the United States would respond furiously to its use, both on the
battlefield and in war crimes trials later.;    Tanks and fighting vehicles
followed the engineers into Kuwait, seeking to flush the Iraqi tanks from
their holes. Air Force A-10s and Army Apache and Cobra gunships fired Hellfire
missiles and 30mm cannon at Iraqi tanks that moved.;    To attack tanks that
remain dug in, allied infantry members will most likely jump from the Bradleys
and engage surviving Iraqis in what Pentagon officials believe will be the
conflict's bloodiest phase: "They'll have machine guns instead of bayonets,"
one Army officer said.;    With the traditional "fog of war" thickened by a
black pall of smoke from nearly 200 oil fires inside Kuwait, additional
"friendly fire" deaths among allied forces are virtually certain, U.S.
officials admit.;    Meanwhile, Army helicopters are unloading hundreds of
soldiers to capture or hastily build air strips inside Kuwait and Iraq. Within
hours, C-130 cargo planes will begin ferrying fresh U.S. troops into Kuwait
and Iraq and flying allied casualties from the battle zone.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  MODERN WAR does not end when the troops stop shooting and go home. The carnage
continues for 20 or 30 years as men and women working the land or walking on
old trails step on land mines or children pick up small mines that look like
stones or even toys.;    One-legged men and children without hands are the
enduring symbols of the technical savagery of today's battlefields and the
people who must live on them after a war is over -- in Afghanistan, in
Cambodia and Laos, and now in Kuwait and Iraq. There are believed to be as
many as 1 million land mines buried in the sands along the border between
Kuwait and Iraq. They will not all be found and detonated or removed after the
war, not at all.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WHAT VICTORS REAP
FIELDS WILL STILL EXPLODE DEATH  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Richard Reeves is a nationally syndicated columnist.

<TEXT>     There will be no maps of the fields of death after the war -- as there are
no maps of the mines in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan. Many of the devices
were just dropped from planes. The newer ones are mostly plastic, defying the
metal detectors that were used in World War II and are still used by
beachcombers searching for the metallic flotsam and jetsam of ocean holidays.;
   If those numbers seem exaggerated -- millions? -- consider the fact that
Americans building a road near the border between Cambodia and Thailand two
months ago found more than 6,000 anti-personnel mines in a one-kilometer
(6/10ths of a mile) stretch of roadway. The whole purpose of the road, in
fact, was to try to build a safe pathway through mine fields laid in that
jungle over the past 20 years.;    "No one remembers who put them there or
why," said one of the road builders, supervising detonation operations,
basically running bulldozers back and forth over the terrain.;    Mines are
cheap and small -- and they are vicious. The Soviets' standard PMN, probably
the most common mine used in the world today, is only 4 1/2 inches in diameter
and weighs less than a pound and a half. Many anti-personnel mines,
mass-produced all over the world, are designed not to kill but to maim. A man
or a woman with one leg, a child with one hand or a smashed face, is a walking
reminder of the price of resistance to invaders or guerrillas. More often than
not, mines are weapons of intimidation, weapons of terror.;    "If I had the
power to do one thing in life, it would be to outlaw mines," said Dawn Calabia
of the U.S. Catholic Conference, who was chairwoman of a delegation from the
Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children visiting Cambodia in
January. She had just come from another small clinic-factory making primitive
prosthetic devices for mine victims -- as many as 500 a month in that tortured
country now. In Laos, steel and aluminum from American planes downed 25 years
ago are used to make artificial limbs for the dozen or so reported mine
victims in that country each month.;    There are mines for all seasons, all
reasons, a grim tribute to the ingenuity of men trying to destroy each other.
Some anti-tank mines can toss a 60-ton tank into the air like a toy.
"Butterfly" mines, dropped thousands at a time from Soviet airplanes over
Afghanistan, weigh only a few ounces, just enough to take a hand or a foot.
"Bouncing Bettys" are smaller than a soup can, but they spring into the air
and explode at waist level, at the level of vital organs. They're designed to
kill, but to do it slowly so that the enemy has the logistical and morale
problems of dealing with the blood and noise of suffering compatriots.;    No
one, including the United States, is innocent in this business, a very
profitable one, but most of the mines I have seen around the world were
Soviet-made or Chinese copies of Soviet mines. Countries as small as Chile and
Singapore also make the things. A tiny Chilean directional mine is popular.;  
 I, for one, have not been able to figure out the moral distinction between
"banned" chemical weapons and napalm, or our new fuel-air bombs that explode a
cloud of gas above ground, creating a vacuum that sucks the oxygen out of the
lungs of anyone on the ground within hundreds of yards. We are horrified by
the one, especially if our enemy of the moment possibly has it, and proud of
the other because it is a tribute to our technological skill and concern over
"collateral damage" to civilian lungs.;    Despite the videotapes of smart
bombs and the cool, reassuring talk of modern military men, war is hell. And,
like hell, it tortures forever in parts of the world abandoned after famous
victories and defeats, leaving the landscape carelessly littered with death
and pain.  </TEXT>

   Like a growing number of Americans who
served in Vietnam, Cherie Rankin returned there after 20 years to
help rebuild a small part of what the war destroyed.
   In doing so, she also restored a part of her life.
   ``I think what it means is there's been enough distance from the
trauma to make it safe for people to deal with it,'' she said. ``It
means relations between our two countries are going to improve.''
   For six weeks, Ms. Rankin, a former Red Cross worker, labored in
the punishing sun mixing mortar to help build a medical clinic near
Hanoi destroyed by U.S. bombers.
   At the end of October, she came home to the United States for
the second time, a ``twice-in-a-lifetime experience.'' She cried
for the living she left behind this trip. The last time, in 1971,
it was for the dead.
   Two decades ago, she brought back with her the images of war,
orphans scorched by napalm and blinded by bombs. This time, she
came back with images of carefree, curious, clinging children who
followed her wherever she went.
   Returning home, she clutched a hat full of love: the conical hat
her Vietnamese co-workers signed as a remembrance on the day the
clinic was finished and they parted with warm embraces and tears.
   ``There was a lot of crying that day,'' she recalled.
   In a sense, her return was part of a broader pilgrimage by
Americans in recent years. Their return is a sentimental journey, a
reconnecting with their past, when they were young men and women
undergoing a transcendent experience.
   Ms. Rankin was only 24 then. For more than 10 years after she
came home the first time in September 1971 after a year's tour,
thinking about Vietnam made her sick to her stomach. She threw up
at a reunion of Red Cross workers in 1984.
   Today, at age 44, she said Vietnam revisited has probably
exorcised the demons from her mind that even counseling couldn't
capture. Ms. Rankin herself is a psychotherapist.
   ``I think it has probably put a closure on it in a way that it
hadn't before,'' she said. ``I probably will never use the word
`resolve.' It's not something I want to have resolved. I don't ever
want to forget the pain of the war because I might become
complacent about war.''
   Her return helped change the images in her mind of napalmed
babies, starving children and the poverty and sadness she read in
the faces of the Vietnamese when she was there two decades before.
   ``What I see now is ... happy children, sparkle and twinkles in
the eyes of the people going on with their lives,'' Ms. Rankin
said. ``There's still incredible poverty, but it's not so dirty.
They're not starving because they grow their own food and are able
to do that now.
   ``They still don't have things, still live in small homes and
they don't have access to good medical care. But it's not the same
kind of thing that happened during the war when they were displaced
from their ancestral roots and their agricultural attachment to the
land.''
   Ms. Rankin was part of a group of seven American civilians and
military veterans who paid their own way to Vietnam to build badly
needed medical facilities. They were the third team of Americans to
return under the auspices of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration
Project in Garberville, Calif.
   Only non-governmental American organizations can give Vietnam
humanitarian aid since the two governments have no diplomatic
relations and the United States has imposed a trade embargo on the
country.
   Ms. Rankin said most of the Vietnamese expressed interest in
restoring relations so there could be free trade, communications
and travel.
   ``They really are puzzled by our continued boycott of them and
they were constantly in wonder of us,'' she said. ``It was
impossible to walk down the street without being surrounded by
adults as well as children.
   ``I think that I - and it's probably true for the other veterans
that went with me - represented something bigger to the Vietnamese.
The people we met saw us as representatives of our government. So
there was a sense ... that things were softening. ... Fifteen years
is long enough to hold a grudge.''
   Kevin Bowen, a veteran and co-director of The William Joiner
Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, said Americans returning to
Vietnam are finding it a way of healing some of the mental wounds
of the war.
   ``I think for veterans in this country, it's important to get
this episode behind us,'' said Bowen, who has made five trips back
to Vietnam. ``We need to have different relations with Vietnam and
with our past and not an angry, vindictive relationship. We're not
just punishing Vietnam. We're punishing ourselves.''
   Ms. Rankin returned to Vietnam with the intention of mourning
the men whose hands she held as they lay dying and the Vietnamese
orphans she embraced - the blind, the legless, the retarded.
   She had detached herself from her feelings during the war in
order to do the job of building morale among the GIs.
   This time, work got in her way.
   ``I didn't really have a lot of time,'' she said. ``The work was
very exhausting. We also had a lot of demands on our after-hours
time, going to meet their governing bodies, to functions and to
cultural events.''
   But she cried when she said goodbye to her Vietnamese friends at
the clinic and when she visited the grounds of the Sacred Heart
Orphanage in Da Nang, where she had tended the children in her free
time.
   The orphanage was almost exactly as she remembered it. But the
children had been moved to another home south of Da Nang. In one of
the many ironies of Vietnam, Sacred Heart now is home for old
people who have nobody, their children killed in the war.
   After the clinic was built, Ms. Rankin spent two more weeks in
Vietnam. She retraced her wartime steps in what was then South
Vietnam, basking in the moments that almost seemed unreal - and
remembering.
   The sites stepped out of history to meet her: Marble Mountain,
Monkey Mountain, China Beach.
   She recognized them all.

Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In Biblical times, it was forbidden to destroy orchards of the enemy.
Medieval warriors were enjoined from poisoning village wells. In the American
Civil War, a confederate officer was convicted of murder for the mistreatment
of Union soldiers at Andersonville Prison. In the Vietnam War, Lt. William
Calley was found guilty of murder for his role in the My Lai massacre.;   
Today, as the diplomatic deadline looms for Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait,
allied artillery continues to batter Iraqi positions. And two massive armies
are still poised to engage in a land battle.;    Whether the dreaded ground
war will occur is at this point unknown. What is known, however is that in the
gulf war, as perhaps never before in U.S. military history, the rules of
engagement are playing an important symbolic and practical role:;    (box)
Lawyers from all branches of the service are on the battlefront, advising
military strategists on how to tailor battle plans to minimize civilian
casualties and manage enemy prisoners.;    (box) Legal experts confer almost
daily with Pentagon officials about target lists to guide the thousands of
bombing missions over Iraq away from civilian areas and religious sites.;   
(box) Every soldier receives some training in the legal aspects of war. Combat
troops carry cards on how to treat prisoners.;    "Marines do not harm enemies
who surrender," reads one such battlefield ethical guide. "They must disarm
them and turn them over to their superiors. Marines do not kill or torture
prisoners. Marines collect and care for the wounded, whether friend or foe."; 
  To Nicholas Fotion, who teaches military ethics at Emory University in
Atlanta, the heightened ethical awareness in the gulf war has both tactical
and moral value.;    "In some strange sense, it's probably profitable to be
ethical," says Fotion, a professor of philosophy and author of "Military
Ethics: Looking Toward the Future," newly published by the Hoover Institution
at Stanford University. "Insofar as we fight an ethical war, the military
retains support in the United States and it maintains the support among our
allies.";    Saddam's decision to take the ethical low road in this war --
displaying downed, possibly tortured American pilots on Iraqi television;
fouling Persian Gulf waters with a massive oil slick (to which Allied bombing
may, however, have contributed); and Friday, in possible retreat, setting
hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells afire -- may only enhance the allied forces'
position, in Fotion's view.;    "Being good, tactically speaking, pays off,"
Fotion says. "Our military realizes that in this war, because we have such a
great military advantage, we should not respond in kind. If they use poison
gas, or start shooting prisoners, we should not retaliate. If we did, the
delicate alliance we have fashioned with the Arab nations would quickly fall
apart.";    High-tech terror;  Fotion is confident that through diplomacy and
the high-tech weaponry that gave allied forces the military edge, this war
will end soon. But he is less confident about the conduct of future wars, in
which smart bombs and laser-guided weapons systems will become increasingly
available.;    "In the hands of ruthless commanders, the weapons created by
technology seem irresistibly to allow them to commit atrocities much more
swiftly than before," he says.;    "In the gulf war, technology is obviously
not all bad. In fact, where one side has significant technological advantage
over another, technology seems to make fighting an ethically clean war far
more possible. But what would happen if two high-technology powers of roughly
equal strength got into a fight? An all-out high-tech war would be dirty by
its very nature.";    But as tensions mount in the hours before the diplomatic
deadline, so do ethical dilemmas to commanders in the field. Reports surfaced
from Saudi Arabia on Friday that waves of U.S. airplanes rained napalm and
deadly fuel-air bombs onto Iraqi defenses.;    Vietnam's lessons;  Fotion says
the enhanced ethical awareness of the military in the gulf war is a legacy of
the Vietnam War, a military encounter rife with moral ambiguities for the
nation and for the soldiers in the field.;    The guerrilla nature of the
conflict made it hard for soldiers to distinguish friend from foe. And the My
Lai massacre, in which American soldiers raped and murdered Vietnamese
villagers, became an emblem of the war's skewed moral compass.;    Trying to
teach morality;  "The military has learned its lessons from Vietnam," Fotion
says. "In the past, the military academies taught military strategy and how to
kill people. Now, courses in ethics are required of all cadets. Those courses
were not in place 20 years ago.";    Col. Kenneth Wenker, professor of
philosophy at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, says there has been a
subtle shift of emphasis across the curriculum to emphasize ethics.;    "When
presented with an ethical or moral dilemma, there's a tendency to have a
knee-jerk reaction and declare a situation all black or all white," Wenker
says. "But with some training, people learn to deal with ambiguity.;    "We
simply have to insist on the integrity of individuals," he adds. "We have to
insist that our people understand the moral reasons of why we go to war. What
we're doing has a moral dimension.";    Fotion just received first-hand
evidence from a former student, now serving as a Marine, addressing the moral
dimensions of what is going on in this war.;    "I got a letter from him the
other day in which he talked about the dirty tricks the Iraqi soldiers played
in the battle at Khafji," Fotion says, referring to an episode in which Iraqis
drove tanks toward allied forces with their guns facing backward. Perceiving
it as a traditional sign of surrender, the allied forces held their fire. When
the Iraqi tanks got closer, they turned the guns around and began firing.;   
"This student was so angry about this kind of tactic, he wrote he'd take
scalps from dead Iraqis soldiers and bring them home as trophies in
retaliation," Fotion says. "I fired off a letter telling him if you guys do
start scalping enemy dead, you'll not only get court-martialed but you'll do
our whole campaign a disservice.";  The Army's code of ethics; Army lawyers
teach front-line troops rules of battlefield conduct.; Forbidden targets,
tactics, techniques;    1. Don't attack noncombatants;    2. Don't shoot at a
parachute unless it holds a combatant (an enemy pilot who has ejected is not a
combatant unless he resists surrender after landing; enemy paratroops are);   
3. Don't shoot at Red Cross or hide behind medical service symbols;    4.
Don't cause destruction beyond requirements of mission;    5. Don't attack
protected property (religious, art, science, archeology) unless enemy using

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hanan </F>
al-Badri, and Salih Qallab: "Massacre in Aden, Emigration From 
Sanaa, and Accusations of Use of Chemical Weapons"] 
  [Excerpts] London, New York, Amman, Aden, Sanaa, AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT -- Fierce fighting continued yesterday in numerous 
areas in Lahij Government, north of Aden. Meanwhile the Yemeni 
Government in Sanaa announced its acceptance of Security Council 
Resolution 924 calling for a cease-fire between northern and 
southern forces. [passage omitted] 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
fierce fighting in Tawr al-Bahah, Lahij Governorate, is 
attributable to the attempt by four northern battalions to 
advance toward Aden through al-Hawtah, led by Colonel 'Ali 
Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st Tank Division and 
half-brother of the Yemeni president. So southern forces worked 
to encircle these units in a bid to capture 'Ali Muhsin 
al-Ahmar, especially as reports had said that a number of 
northern commanders who are the Yemeni president's uncles were 
with him. 
  These developments coincided with accusations exchanged 
between the northern and southern leaderships about the use of 
banned weapons. The accusations included a statement by Judge 
Hammud al-Hattar in Sanaa that southern forces are using napalm 
bombs in their attacks on northern units. He said that there 
"is irrefutable evidence of that." Meanwhile Southern Defense 
Minister Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir expressed his suspicions 
that northern forces are using chemical weapons. He added that 
"these suspicions are justifiable." 
  Brig. Haytham said that "our suspicions are reinforced by 
the 
distinct and special relationship between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who used these weapons 
against the Kurds in 1988." [passage omitted] 
  High-ranking southern leaders have denied reports which have 
aroused alarm among some circles about an advance by northern 
forces toward the Dar Sa'd area. They told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
over the telephone: "How can that happen, when Democratic Yemen 
formed its new government yesterday -- a proof that matters are 
stable," despite the ongoing fighting there. 
  Southern officials said that some northern militias 
belonging 
to the Yemeni Reform Grouping have stormed Sabr prison in the 
Tawr al-Bahah area and freed some prisoners. They added that 
Aden forces clashed with them. They confirmed that conditions 
are now calm there. [passage omitted]

'60S RADICAL PUTS PAST BEHIND HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the nation watched in late 1969 and early 1970, John Froines and his 
co-defendants turned the Chicago 7 trial into a theater of the absurd 
protesting the U.S. political system. 
</P>
<P>
But that was then; this is now. 
</P>
<P>
The chemist, recently named director of UCLA's Occupational Health Center, 
wants to know why reporters can't ask about his public health career from 1974 
to the present. Why do they focus on his radical past? 
</P>
<P>
"People are always saying, 'Is John Froines the same radical he was in 1968?' 
The problem with those questions is that they do not look at how the society 
changes, how people change and how circumstances change. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is the same now as then," Froines said. "I think it's more valuable to 
look at a person's history -- to see if they have been consistent within the 
context of their values. We still need student protesters because many of the 
problems of the '60s continue and new issues have emerged. But nobody's a 
student activist at 50. You'd have to have your head examined." 
</P>
<P>
Froines no longer lives like a student activist. He resides with his second 
wife, KCBS producer Andrea Hricko, and their 6-year-old son in a Spanish-style 
Santa Monica home that they recently enlarged. Natural light bounces off shiny 
wooden floors everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-11 and 180 pounds, the graying researcher with wire-rim glasses looks 
as if he could have been a college running back. He dressed casually for an 
interview in a plaid sport shirt open at the collar, a blue V-neck sweater and 
green cotton pants. He slouched with his hands in his pockets or touched his 
cheek to ponder questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam was a cataclysmic event in American history," Froines said. "It 
brought hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people together in opposition 
to war. I don't think those circumstances exist now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's (not important to) . . . worry about (whether) a demonstration in 
1989 was like 1969 because they are not the same eras." 
</P>
<P>
Today Froines resembles not so much a revolutionary as a man surrounded by 
comforts and immersed in middle-class pursuits. He skis, runs marathons, dotes 
on his son and works 60 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a 50-year-old father of a 6-year-old," he said. "My son and I spend a lot 
of time together. I do not like to travel as much. I basically work, spend time 
with my boy and do physical things outside." 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike some '60s-era activists, he also works comfortably with corporate 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the occupational health division of the Vermont Health Department 
from 1974 to 1977, he helped persuade the state's nuclear power industry to 
accept health standards tougher than federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
As director of a division of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
in Washington from 1977 to 1979, he was principal author of federal standards 
regulating workers' exposure to lead and cotton dust. 
</P>
<P>
He was named deputy director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health in Rockville, Md., in 1979 and joined UCLA as an associate professor 
of environmental and occupational health sciences in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As a professor, Froines conducted a study to determine which Southern 
California jobs and industries had the highest exposure to 500 separate 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
As the newly named head of the UCLA's Occupational Health Center he is 
overseeing another study to determine how some industrial chemicals cause early 
aging of the brain and how others interact with DNA to trigger the first stages 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, John Froines is one of the most meticulous scientists in the area 
of environmental toxicology," said Dick Davis, executive director of the 
Chemical Industry Council of California. The trade organization's members 
include Dow Chemical, the subject of Vietnam era anti-war demonstrations for 
producing napalm, as well as Exxon Corp. and Du Pont. 
</P>
<P>
Froines makes no apologies for being highly regarded within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they think I am scientifically honest, and I try to be," he said. "To 
have a high degree of scientific integrity is important to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not come down along ideological lines. I will clearly be seen as a 
worker advocate in occupational health, but will interpret science objectively, 
and I think that improves things for workers." 
</P>
<P>
Froines says he became devoted to scientific objectivity while earning a B.S. 
in chemistry at his hometown university, UC Berkeley, in 1963 and a Ph.D. at 
Yale in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Yale that Froines joined Students for a Democratic Society and began 
organizing poor whites and blacks in the Hill section of New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
He met fellow organizers Rennie Davis, Dave Dellinger and Tom Hayden, now a 
Democratic California assemblyman from Santa Monica. Froines did not know the 
other Chicago 7 defendants -- Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale and Lee 
Weiner -- until he went to Chicago to help organize street demonstrations at 
the 1968 Democratic Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Eight defendants were charged with conspiracy to incite violence and crossing 
state lines to incite violence at the convention. Six weeks through the trial, 
Judge Julius J. Hoffman declared a mistrial in Seale's case, sentencing him to 
four years in prison for contempt of court and reducing the eight defendants to 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial Froines laughed at a witness's answer and called it "stupid." He 
also refused two of Judge Hoffman's orders to rise and later defied the 
jurist's instructions by telling jurors that after they had left the room, 
fellow defendant Seale had been sentenced to four years in prison for contempt 
of court. 
</P>
<P>
Froines' antics were comparatively mild. Other defendants often put their 
booted feet on black leather chairs and sometimes wore black judicial robes, 
took them off and stomped on them. Rubin marched in front of Hoffman's bench 
shouting "Heil Hitler" and Dellinger shouted "You're a liar, Judge Hoffman." 
</P>
<P>
Despite these actions, a jury acquitted all seven defendants of conspiracy to 
incite violence. Davis, Dellinger, Hayden, Abbie Hoffman and Rubin were found 
guilty of crossing state lines with intent to riot, but those convictions and 
Seale's contempt citation were overturned on appeal. The defendants and their 
attorneys were also cited nearly 200 times for contempt of court, but all but 
15 of the citations, including all against Froines, were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his acquittal Froines entered public health work and in following 
years other Chicago 7 defendants pursued mainstream careers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rubin's New York company produces posh nightclub parties for yuppies, 
while former Black Panther Seale recently published a barbecue cookbook and 
works in minority recruitment at Temple University. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner works with direct mail and membership development at the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai Brith in New York, while Davis is president of a Denver think 
tank that develops technologies for the environment. Lifelong activist 
Dellinger resides in Peacham, Vt., and has protested U.S. involvement in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Former Yippie Abbie Hoffman committed suicide last April at age 52. Hayden is 
the only member of the group whom Froines sees. A few Saturdays ago they 
watched the movie "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
The further Froines gets from the trial, the more his feelings about it mellow. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless he recalls the trial as grueling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frightening. It was absolutely emotionally draining," Froines said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressures from the trial shortened many of the defendants' relationships with 
wives or girlfriends, and Froines' first marriage was no exception. But he said 
he maintains good relationships with his former wife and his daughter, now 21, 
who live in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The researcher met his current wife when she coordinated the Labor Occupational 
Health Program at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Hricko is prominently featured in the photos Froines keeps on the window ledge 
of his narrow UCLA office. In one picture his then-3-year-old daughter from his 
first marriage strolls through a living room in a floral print dress and tennis 
shoes. Behind her on the wall hangs a Richard Avedon poster of the Chicago 7 
grouped around Froines. 
</P>
<P>
Next to that photo are four others of his blond, curly haired son, Jonathan, 
sitting in his mother's lap, holding his mother's hand, hugging a teddy bear 
and looking intently at the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In Froines' office, at least, his radical past and scholarly present come 
together.

   The roll call of six combat
photographers who died in Vietnam evoked painful memories and tears
at a memorial honoring them and 57 other journalists who were
killed covering that war.
   _Larry Burrows, Life Magazine, Henri Huet, The Associated Press,
Kent Potter, United Press International, killed in 1971 when the
helicopter in which they were flying was shot down while they were
covering a South Vietnamese offensive in Laos.
   _Michel Laurent, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, Gamma
Photo Agency, killed in an ambush two days before the war ended in
1975; he was the last western journalist killed.
   _Kyoichi Sawada, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, UPI,
killed in an ambush in Cambodia in 1970.
   _Huynh Thanh My, AP photographer, killed in a battle in the
Mekong Delta in 1965.
   After My was killed, his brother, Huynh Cong ``Nick'' Ut, then
only 17, took his place with the AP. Eight years later, Ut won a
Pulitzer Prize for his photo of a horrified Vietnam girl running
naked down a highway after a napalm strike by South Vietnamese
bombers seared her body.
   Ut, now based in Los Angeles, was among the more than 200
photographers, staff members and guests at the second-annual Eddie
Adams workshop who honored the journalists Sunday in this year of
the 150th anniversary of photography.
   ``I wish my mother and brothers and sisters (still in Vietnam)
would have been here to share this unforgettable moment and place
where our fallen comrades including my beloved brother are
posthumously being commemorated,'' Ut said in prepared remarks.
   ``I am at this very minute feeling very humble and very proud of
the achievements and sacrifices sustained by our fallen colleagues
including my brother.''
   Ut was so choked with emotion that he was unable to speak and
asked a colleague to read his remarks. ``I saw my brother's name
and I could not speak,'' Ut said afterward.
   The Marine Corps also paid tribute to the fallen journalists.
   ``They made the ultimate sacrifice in recording history for
people of all countries throughout the world,'' Commandant A.M.
Gray said in a message delivered by a staff member. ``Our nation
owes these journalists and photographers its honor, gratitude and
respect.''
   The ceremony was the idea of Adams, a Vietnam Pulitzer-Prize
winner himself. It was held on a hilltop on his workshop-farm in
the Catskills around a slate table inscribed with the first names
of the six photographers who were his best friends.
   Six small blue spruce trees were planted around the table, one
for each of the photographers. A seventh tree was planted in honor
of the other journalists killed in the war.
   Then, the men and women who had gathered, some who were only
toddlers during the Vietnam War, some with tears in their eyes,
lifted their champagne-filled glasses and toasted the fallen.

   A firebomb ripped through a crowded
university lecture hall Friday and injured 40 students, including
13 who suffered severe burns, officials said.
   It was the third such bomb attack in just over a year at
universities in Brussels. No one has claimed responsibility for any
of the attacks.
   The bomb went off at 9 a.m. in a Louvain University auditorium
packed with about 100 students attending a pharmacy class, said a
police official who asked not to be named.
   The explosive device was hidden in a briefcase. It included
fluid soap, which has an effect like napalm when it is part of a
bomb, the official said.
   A similar bomb was used in a Dec 1, 1989 bomb attack at Brussels
University across town.
   ``There was a sudden blast, a big fire and part of the roof came
crashing down,'' said Paul Tulkens, who was in the class Friday.
Some students ran out with hair and clothes on fire. Evidence of a
firebomb was found in the hall, officials said.
   University spokesman Paul Macq said the university had not
received any threats or warnings.

Dow Chemical's Popoff Named President,
Will Succeed Oreffice as Chief in Late '87

<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. named Frank P. Popoff president and chief operating officer and said he will succeed Paul F. Oreffice as chief executive officer later this year. 

   Mr. Popoff, 51 years old, had been the executive vice president responsible for all foreign operations, world-wide manufacturing and employee relations. 
He succeeds Mr. Oreffice as president, and is scheduled to become chief executive Dec. 1. 
The chief operating officer's post is a new one. 
Mr. Oreffice, 59, will remain chairman after Dec. 1. 

   In addition, the chemical company increased its quarterly dividend five cents to 55 cents a share, reflecting the board's "confidence in the sustained earnings" of Dow in the future, Mr. Oreffice said. 
The dividend is payable July 30 to stock of record June 30. 

   Mr. Oreffice also said he expects Dow to post record profit and sales for the second quarter. 
The previous record quarterly results came in the first period, when it reported profit of $246 million, or $1.28 a share, on sales of $3.02 billion. 

   Mr. Oreffice made his comments at the annual meeting. 
He said it is possible that Dow could reach $1 billion in profit this year if business remains strong, though he later emphasized that he wasn't making a forecast. 
In 1986, Dow Chemical earned $732 million, or $3.82 a share, on sales of $11.11 billion. 

   Mr. Popoff will take the reins of the big chemical and pharmaceuticals maker at one of the stronger moments in Dow's recent history. 
Under Mr. Oreffice, Dow has trimmed excess capacity in its basic chemicals operations, which contributed to $592 million in charges in 1985, and expanded its specialty chemicals businesses. 
Several years ago, the company set a goal of making specialty chemicals account for 50% of profit by 1987, a target Dow met last year. 
By comparison, when Dow began its push into specialty chemicals in 1978, the business contributed only about 15% of profit. 

   Lately, Dow has also reaped the benefits of some coincidental factors, such as lower raw materials expenses, especially oil, and a weakened dollar abroad, which has boosted exports. 

   There had been some speculation that Keith R. McKennon, group vice president and director of research and development, might be chosen as the new chief executive, but Mr. Popoff's broad marketing and international experience helped him win the new post. 
"Both Frank and I had a lot of international experience and I think, for a company that has over 50% of its sales outside (the U.S.), that's very important," Mr. Oreffice said. 

   Dow is increasing its business abroad; one sign of the company's increasingly international outlook is the fact that four of its 17 board members are foreign-born, including Mr. Oreffice, born in Italy, and Mr. Popoff, born in Bulgaria. 

   Mr. Popoff's previous positions with Dow include stints as general manager of the agricultural and organic chemicals department of Dow Chemical U.S.A. and vice president, marketing and sales, for Dow Chemical Europe. 
He has degrees in chemistry and business administration. 

   Mr. Popoff, who says he enjoys a good game of gin rummy, said "the road map has been drawn out" for Dow's corporate strategy, but he plans to do some "fine-tuning." 
Among other things, Dow will continue to expand its pharmaceuticals business and to try to carve out a bigger share of markets in countries such as Japan. 
As for research and development, Mr. Popoff believes that "the next round of success will go to those companies that get it right technologically." 

   Mr. Oreffice could remain chairman until he reaches age 65. 
He said that, once he steps down as chief executive, he plans to focus on his role as a representative of Dow. 
The chief executive, who often brags about his tennis game, also said he hopes to spend more time at his home in Scottsdale, Ariz., perfecting his game. 

   Dow Chemical has an unusually specific policy of "deceleration," which requires line managers to relinquish their line duties at age 60, or five years after their last significant promotion, whichever is later. 
Mr. Oreffice has been chief executive since 1978. 

   Hunter W. Henry, executive vice president, succeeds Mr. Popoff as head of all non-U.S. operations. 
Mr. Henry had been president of Dow Chemical U.S.A. Mr. McKennon was named to succeed Mr. Henry as head of U.S. operations.

<TEXT>     Kurdish rebels reported new gains in their struggle against the government
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But the United States underscored its
neutrality in the civil war that has raged since Saddam's forces were defeated
one month ago by the allies.;    The temporary cease-fire that ended the war
stipulated that Iraq keep its warplanes grounded, but there have been several
violations and U.S. warplanes shot down two Iraqi jets last week.;    U.S.
forces continue to occupy a large area of southern Iraq but have made no
attempt to keep the Iraqi helicopter gunships from flying combat missions,
which rebel groups claim have been used to drop mustard gas and napalm on
insurgents.;    On Tuesday, the White House was non-committal on what the
United States would do about Iraqi forces' use of helicopter gunships.
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater did say Iraq's use of the helicopters was a
violation of an understanding between Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander
of U.S. forces in the gulf, and defeated Iraqi military leaders.;    But the
helicopters do not actually violate the conditional cease-fire agreement, he
said.;    "This was an understanding that was reached in discussions between
Gen. Schwarzkopf and it was a side, oral discussion -- nothing in writing," he
said.;    Fitzwater was vague about how the allies would respond to continued
Iraqi use of the gunships.;    "The fact is . . . we want to be murky on
this," he said. "We aren't going to tell you exact rules for how we're going
to deal with these helicopters. We aren't going to tell you why, and we aren't
going to tell Saddam why. Let him guess.";    The Kurdish rebels claimed today
they captured two government warplanes while overrunning an air base near the
northern oil center of Kirkuk. The claim could not be independently
confirmed.;    The Kurds also said hundreds of Iraqi officers and thousands
more government soldiers have deserted and joined their struggle.;    Rebel
leader Jalal Talabani, who ended 18 months in exile when he arrived at the
town of Zakho near the Turkish border on Tuesday, said the captured planes
were a MiG-21 fighter and a Sukhoi bomber, both Soviet-built.;    He said
government troops managed to destroy three other planes but the two captured
were undamaged.;    The rebels also said they overran a government camp at
Faardiya, 35 miles south of Zakho on the road between Dohuk and
government-held Mosul, the country's third-largest city. It was not clear when
the attacks were launched.;    The Kurds claim to control virtually all of the
largely mountainous territory of northeastern Iraq, running roughly from Zakho
southeast to Kirkuk and Khanaqin near the Iranian border.;    The area, which
borders Turkey and Iran, encompasses about 12,500 square miles and is home to
most of Iraq's 4 million Kurds.;    A Baghdad newspaper today said Iraq has
restored "peace, stability and order" to southern Iraq. The State Department
and the Pentagon said Tuesday that Iraqi forces were believed to be
consolidating control of the south.;    The Iraqi newspaper, Al-Jumhuriya,
also claimed the operation of "mopping up pockets of saboteurs in the northern
areas" was going according to plan.;    At the United Nations on Tuesday, the
United States and other leading Security Council members were finalizing a
draft resolution that sets terms for a permanent cease-fire.;    Under its
terms, Iraq would have to destroy any remaining chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons and would still face an arms embargo.;    Reparations,
however, were among the sticking points, with the Soviets reported opposing a
plan to skim Iraqi oil revenue to compensate nations that suffered losses as a
result of Iraqi aggression.;    Work was expected to continue on the
resolution today.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  I commend your strong stance on American Indian self-rule (Editorials, Jan.
23), and agree that Native Americans can run their own lives at least as well
as the Bureau of Indian Affairs.;    I lived and worked on the Northern
Cheyenne Reservation for four years during the early '70s, developing a
writing system and native school curricula, and I saw firsthand the Indians'
frustration with the bureau's handling of their affairs, especially concerning
nearby coal reserves.  </LEADPARA>

SELF RULE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Native Americans are no longer the uneducated savages as our historic guilt
has portrayed them. Perhaps the following joke, a favorite among the Cheyenne,
will show you how they view the Bureau of Indian Affairs:;    Just before
Custer headed out West to meet his destiny at Little Big Horn, he made the
rounds of various offices in Washington, D.C., to say his goodbyes. As he was
leaving the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he told them, "I'm going out West to
take care of this Indian problem. Don't do anything until I get back.";    --
Dan Hawkmoon Alford; Hayward; OBLIGATIONS COME WITH FINANCIAL AID; In response
to Aimee Allison's "Duty is to life, not to killing" (Commentary, Jan. 23): It
appears to me that Allison had a clear idea of her values concerning life and
a peaceful resolve of differences; she chose to eschew those values in return
for financial aid for college. She clearly states that she would be unable to
perform the job she was trained to do but makes no mention of how she was able
to justify accepting financial aid from the Army.;    Now that it is time to
honor a commitment to perform a job for which she was trained and compensated,
she has chosen not to fulfill her obligation. Perhaps this has a lesson for
Allison and others: Do not sell out your values for financial aid.;    -- Ken
Greenly; Cupertino; DON'T LET GULF WAR BLOT OUT OTHER ISSUES; Thank you for
not permitting the war in the Persian Gulf to let us forget other important
issues around the world. In particular, thanks for "Enough guns to Salvador"
(Editorials, Jan. 18).;    Our nation must be the undisputed world leader in
the protection of human rights. By giving money to the murdering government of
El Salvador we are perpetuating abuse and sending the message to the world
that this conduct not only bears our imprimatur but may be rewarded
financially.;    -- Woody Nedom; Los Gatos; Protest won't end; war in Middle
East; It will do no good whatsoever to protest U.S. involvement in the war in
the Persian Gulf. It takes two to tangle. Rather, we must find a way to get
both sides to end the war.;    As long as the warring continues, however, it
is unfair for the United States to assume most of the burden. The U.N.
resolution was multilateral. Therefore, let all who joined in the resolution
contribute resources to the effort until both sides agree to end it.;    What
would happen if the United States were to withdraw its forces? Would others
step in to fill the gap? Would Saddam Hussein proclaim victory and end the
war? Or would he step up his efforts, prompting intercession by other
countries?;    -- Lawrence Gold; Mountain View; Ecological warfare; leaves
lasting scars; In his war against the allies, Saddam Hussein has unleashed a
very frightening weapon: ecological sabotage. Setting fire to oil facilities
and dumping oil into bodies of water upon which so many depend must not become
an acceptable tool of warfare for anyone.;    War is terrible enough; it
should not be made worse by causing destruction which will far outlast the
conflict.;    -- Dan Haifley; Watsonville; Mention of 'draft'; triggers deja
vu;  I heard the dread words "military draft" and it sent shivers up my spine.
Deja vu -- it's been over 20 years, but suddenly it was like yesterday. But
this time the fear is for someone new: Instead of my brother and boyfriend, it
is for my son.;    I remember the words I read at Dachau. "History forgotten
is often repeated." Have we forgotten?;    Oh, the terms are new -- Scud
missiles instead of napalm, sorties instead of bombs, chemical warheads
instead of Agent Orange. But is the meaning any different? Are we any more
defending our country now than we were 20 years ago? North Vietnam was not
invading our shores any more than Iraq is now.;    Oh, I know about the oil.
But what if we spent the money we're now spending daily on the war on
alternative energy sources? Maybe we could lower our oil dependency.;    I
also know about Saddam Hussein and what a "Hitler" he is. But if you don't
think that he won't be replaced by another dictator, then you don't know the
history of the Middle East.;    Will our "war for peace" really bring peace?
Did 58,000 American deaths change anything 20 years ago? Vietnam is still
communist. Will American deaths change anything this time? Did we really
exhaust all diplomatic means of a settlement, or did we become impatient as
Americans often do? Would the sanctions have worked? These questions keep me
awake at night.;    Yes, I support the our troops in the Middle East coming
home alive; no, I don't support the reasons they're there. Yes, I would give
my life for my country, but no, I won't give my son's life for someone else's
country.;    -- Lynn Calhoun; Saratoga; Heterosexuals fail; to understand
gays; The homosexual predicament is not easily understood by heterosexuals,
and Joanne Jacobs (Commentary, Jan. 10) has not made noteworthy progress in
the direction.;    The compartmentalization of sexuality is simply not part of
the heterosexual experience, while it remains central to the gay experience.
To make a living and to survive on the streets has required that we be
straight-acting, letting down our guard only for moments in segregated
locales. This way of living saps our power and degenerates our sexuality. Now
it is being replaced with lives of integrity -- where honesty and candor
govern our social relations.;    Jacobs dismisses the movement by invoking a
call for privacy and manners. To suggest, as she does, that humans are sexual
only in the bedroom is akin to saying that humans are hungry only in the
dining room. Get real.;    -- Derek Schwartz; San Jose  </TEXT>

FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: America lays ghosts of its war in Vietnam
 -Twenty years on, ending of the trade embargo has closed a chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American presidents sometimes act out of character when occasion demands.
Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism, launched the Marshall Plan and Nato
to put war-shattered Europe back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan, cold war warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co-operation
and communication with China and the former Soviet Union respectively.
By these historical standards, there is something both consistent and
logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under the Vietnam War by his
decision last night to end the trade embargo. This is a president, after
all, who never served in uniform and, as a young man, publicly opposed the
war. There was even a time early in the 1992 campaign when, because of his
evasion of the draft, it seemed he might become its latest victim, nearly 20
years after military hostilities had ceased.
Yet so powerful are the emotions still stirred by the only war the US can
definitively be said to have 'lost' in 200 years that Mr Clinton did not
rush into normalising relations with Vietnam. Instead he carefully built up
political constituencies at home and patiently followed the general road map
laid out by George Bush, another president who, in the first flushes of
victory after the Gulf War, must surely have been tempted also to come to
terms with Vietnam.
America's Vietnam casualty list is long indeed, since President John
Kennedy's fateful steps to contain the communist tide over 30 years ago. It
must begin with the 67,000-plus soldiers who never came home and the many
more who returned maimed in body and mind, the first returning US soldiers
not to be welcomed as conquering heroes.
It took many years, and more controversy, for their sacrifice finally to be
recognised in the shape of the Vietnam Memorial on the Washington Mall. It
is a recognition like no other - a long low dark gray wall etched with the
names of everyone who died - and its juxtaposition next to the heroic and
classical Lincoln Memorial speaks volumes.
The plight of the dead and the survivors is now embedded in popular culture,
recognised in films and books beyond number. Words and images from that era
still resonate - the 'domino theory,' Agent Orange, the Tet offensive, the
My Lai massacre and subsequent trial of Lt William Calley, the pictures of
the little Vietnamese girl burning from napalm, of the execution of a
captured Vietcong and of helicopters whirring above the US embassy in Saigon
as the last Americans were evacuated.
Few, if any, generations, have been so seared by a foreign conflict which
found the nation so divided. The chalice inherited by the 'best and the
brightest' in government, who flocked to Washington with Kennedy and mostly
stayed with Johnson, was poisoned.
Many tuned out and turned off, their contributions to society so much less
than they might have been. A few sought consolation in different forms of
public service - like Robert McNamara who, perhaps, salved his wounds and
guilt as defence secretary with two distinguished terms as president of the
World Bank. But he rarely spoke about Vietnam and only now is putting
together memoirs of the period.
Political victims abound. Lyndon Johnson, faced with turmoil in the streets
of Washington and around his country, decided not to run for re-election in
1968 and died, a broken man, three years later.
His Democratic party, under Hubert Humphrey, not only lost the presidency in
1968 but took years to come to terms with Vietnam, holding the White House
for only four of the next 24 years. In 1972, its presidential nomination was
captured by George McGovern, the anti-war candidate. He went down to an
landslide defeat to Richard Nixon, who, nevertheless, was not above
manipulating the Vietnam peace process on the eve of the election to
maximise his victory (he lost only liberal Massachusetts.)
Four years later, the Watergate scandal helped propel Jimmy Carter into the
White House but he, too, was afflicted by the Vietnam syndrome, this time in
Iran. A botched rescue attempt in the spring of 1980 of the US hostages in
Tehran came to seem pathetically indecisive when compared to Ronald Reagan's
blunt assertion that he would set 'a date certain' for release of the
hostages, in the absence of which US bombs would start falling.
Subsequent Republican presidents seemed to have learned this lesson better,
committing themselves to the doctrine of 'main force', winning little
victories in Grenada and Panama and a big one in the Gulf, and proclaiming
with each notch on the belt that the Vietnam nightmare was over and that US
forces would now be allowed by the politicians to win wars. But this did not
help George Bush in 1992.
Nor is it clear that their contention is valid. There is no evidence of
American appetite for foreign military adventure, be it in Bosnia, Somalia
or anywhere not incontrovertibly related to the national interest.
This may be ascribed to the end of the Cold War and the imperatives of
domestic renewal. But it may also be the real final legacy of Vietnam. 'No
more war' was a powerful chant in the streets of America in 1968. It would
still be so today.

<LEADPARA>  'IT IS OUR belief that the best policy is not to involve ourselves in those
internal conflicts," said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.;    The U.S. might
blockade a country's exports and imports, and then bomb it back to a
"pre-industrial age," destroying factories, power grids, water supplies,
communications lines, bridges and roads. President Bush might urge citizens of
another country to overthrow their Hitler-like leader. Along with the Security
Council, we might demand to monitor the destruction of a country's chemical
and biological weapons, nuclear weapons-grade material and ballistic missiles.
But intervene? Heavens, no.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SPOILING OUR PARADE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Joanne Jacobs, who writes a column on Mondays and Thursdays, is a member of
the Mercury News editorial pages staff.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There are many ways to resolve internal conflicts. Some countries hold an
election to see which leadership the people favor. Albania just did that.
Others might use heavy artillery, tanks and helicopter gunships to shell
populated cities, slaughter rebels and their families and neighbors and
doctors and clergymen, and starve the survivors into submission, with a little
torture for educational and inspirational purposes. That's the Iraqi way.
Different strokes for different folks.;    President Bush "feels for those
people," says deputy White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, but: "The issue of
internal unrest in Iraq is an issue that has to be settled between the
government and the people of Iraq. It's a decision for the people of Iraq to
make.";    And it is being settled, quite finally for tens of thousands of
Iraqis in Karbala and Kirkuk. The decision for the people of Iraq to make is:
Surrender or die? Flee into the mountains to starve and freeze, or stay in
town and get dragged behind a tank?;    It's their decision, and we must
respect that. Wouldn't want to impose our values.;    And besides, it's so
messy, isn't it? I mean, the Shiites are religious fundamentalists and the
Kurds are inconvenient nationalists and nobody's moderate or democratic or
pro-Western. They don't wear business suits and ties!;    Better to block
Iraqi oil exports, thereby preventing the rebuilding of the economy, and
continuing the suffering of the people, so they'll pressure Saddam into taking
early retirement. Oh, that's been tried. Well, maybe Saddam will step down to
save Iraq from suffering on his account. Hmm. Maybe not.;    Actually,
according to all the insider reports from Washington, President Bush never
wanted a revolt of the unwashed masses when he called for the overthrow of
Saddam. He wanted the military or political elite to take over, the sort of
people we know how to deal with. His theory is that once the Iraqi army puts
down the internal disputes, recovering its self-esteem, some nice, well-bred
general will stage a neat, little coup and kick out The Mustache, and Iraq
will stabilize under the New Improved (Blood) Baath Party, restoring the
balance of power and politik.;    It means: Stand by and let the Republican
Guard murder thousands of people till they suppress the popular will, and then
maybe they'll put in a different dictator with blood on a different pair of
hands.;    Normally, my enthusiasm for U.S. involvement in civil wars is
limited. I don't want to see us charging around the world righting wrongs,
especially if the good guys aren't all that good, which is usually the case.; 
  But we've already charged into Iraq. We occupy one-sixth of the country.
We're involved.;    And, pardon me, isn't it just a little late to worry about
stability? If we wanted stability, we should have let Saddam keep Kuwait. That
was a stable situation. For that matter, we should rebuild the Berlin Wall.;  
 As for the much-feared "Lebanonization" of Iraq, which means it might fall
into its original Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish parts, if the people of Iraq don't
want to be the people of Iraq, and it takes brutal repression to keep the
country together (the Kurds say they just want more autonomy), do we prefer
brutal repression to self-determination?;    Bush should have told Saddam
Hussein to ground the helicopter gunships, or see them turned into scrap
metal. Roll the tanks and artillery back to Baghdad. Send the Republican Guard
home for Ramadan. Cut it out.;    In fact, as long as we're ramming a cease
fire down Iraq's throat, why not insist that Iraq hold a free election -- like
the one Saddam Hussein proposed holding in Kuwait -- run by the United
Nations? If Albania is ready for democracy, why not Iraq?;    The threat alone
might do it. If they still remember the Crusaders, they should remember the
U.S. Air Force. And the Iraqi army isn't keen on fighting people who can fight
back.;    If we deny Saddam Hussein the use of his military machine, the
people of Iraq could settle their internal conflicts. Maybe they'd use rifles
but that's less bloody than helicopters and napalm. It would, as William
Safire says, level the killing field.;    Ironically, Iraqis won't curse
America for bombing Iraq. Saddam's troops have killed more civilians and done
more destruction, including devastating Shiite holy cities. Iraqis will curse
America for not bombing the Iraqi army when it turned on its own citizens.;   
President Bush will go down in history not as the liberator of Kuwait, but as
a silent accomplice to the murder of Iraqis who believed the United States
stood for freedom, justice and democracy, and found that all we cared about
was the balance of power, national borders and oil.;    Too bad, Shiites.
Tough luck, Kurds. Go away and die quietly. Don't bleed on our victory parade.  </TEXT>
