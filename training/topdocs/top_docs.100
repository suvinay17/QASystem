GOODALL: SPELLBINDING ADVOCATE FOR ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a week marked by gory photos of mutilated animals and shrill protests on 
behalf of "World Laboratory Animal Liberation Week," she offers a cool, clear 
voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
London-born primatologist Jane Goodall brings with her no pictures of armless 
monkeys, no clever signs such as "Imagine having your body left to science 
while you're still in it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, 55-year-old Goodall, who began studying the wild chimps of Gombe 
Stream National Park in Tanzania nearly 30 years ago, quietly seduces her 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Weapon of choice for the woman who paved the way for Dian Fossey and other ape 
researchers? A spellbinding, awe-inducing slide show on one of her favorite 
chimp families in Gombe. 
</P>
<P>
Here Tuesday, for instance, Goodall unquestionably has the crowd at Santa 
Monica College's gymnasium in the palm of her fine-boned hand. Then she moves 
on to the hot issues of day. If chimpanzees are to survive -- she says they're 
an endangered species, down from millions to perhaps 150,000 in the wild -- 
Goodall insists certain practices must stop. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Private ownership of chimpanzees as pets, celebrity owners such as Michael 
Jackson notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cruel capturing, selling and using chimps and other animals for medical 
research ("It's arrogant of us as humans in the first place just to think we 
have the right to do medical research on animals," she claims, acknowledging, 
however, that because "animal research is built right into almost everything 
that medical research does" an immediate cutoff would create chaos and increase 
human suffering. She believes more alternative research methods should be found 
and rewarded with scientific prizes. In the meantime, she wants more money and 
concern invested into seeing that research animals receive the best possible 
treatment). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abusive treatment of chimpanzees used for entertainment purposes in 
circuses, stage performances and films. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad. Even films that have had a very good message nevertheless 
resulted in the death of some of the chimps," she says. "I think the motivating 
thing that keeps me going on this particular course is the more you know about 
animals, the more horrified you are by cruelty -- to animals and towards human 
beings. A lot of it is due to ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Lecture Tour 
</P>
<P>
Slim and elegant with her graying hair pulled back in a simple ponytail and 
only the slightest touch of makeup coloring her face, Goodall is on her annual 
lecture tour. Having arrived from Seattle at 2 a.m. after taping a segment for 
Ted Koppel's "Nightline" there, she's had little sleep, arrives slightly late 
for a fast press conference at the college, then heads to the gym for her 
speech, where it's standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
At its conclusion, she receives a standing ovation, with students and faculty 
members instantly descending on her in a frenzied swarm after she leaves the 
lectern. 
</P>
<P>
A bit taken aback by the crowd pressing in on her so tightly, she reveals it's 
a new, if momentarily unsettling experience. Then, quickly seeing its public 
relations value, she asks a photographer if he's captured the mob scene on film 
and requests copies of the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Goodall sees much of the contribution of her later years as raising 
consciousness about animals and what humans can learn from them. About a third 
of her year is now spent lecturing (her fee is $15,000 per speech) and 
fund-raising for the Tucson-based Jane Goodall Institute, which supports a 
staff of six and assorted research and education projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Life of Thirds 
</P>
<P>
Another third of her year is spent in Gombe, where Tanzania natives now 
accomplish most of her field research with video cameras. And the final third 
of the year is invested at her home in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where she is a 
visiting professor in zoology at the University of Dar es Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. animal psychologists, Goodall's work is internationally 
respected, both by scientists and lay observers alike. And it's considered 
seminal, particularly her findings that chimpanzees are capable of making and 
using tools -- behavior previously thought to be the exclusive territory of 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
"Her work is almost comparable to that of Einstein's," said Roger Fouts, a 
professor of psychology at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Wash., 
who has conducted language experiments with laboratory chimpanzees for more 
than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What Einstein is to physics, Jane Goodall is to the behavioral sciences. She's 
had a tremendous philosophical effect as well. . . . She showed us there was a 
mentality there (in chimps). . . . Most science comes up with theory and then 
we go out and try to force the animals to do what the theory says. Jane's is a 
humble science. She asks the animals to tell her about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Off the record, some animal psychologists and primatologists will say that 
there is virtually no comparison between the work of Goodall, the pioneer in 
the field, and the late Dian Fossey, who may currently be better known than 
Goodall because of her mysterious death and the popularity of the film 
"Gorillas in the Mist." Indeed, some researchers note that whereas Goodall has 
been a careful, reliable observer, Fossey was considered a problem-plagued 
flake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Recognizable' 
</P>
<P>
Fouts affirms that, by and large, such perceptions are commonplace within the 
scientific community. "Dian had some personal problems that interfered with her 
work," he said. "Dian really didn't have the training that Jane brought to it. 
And Jane published much more. Jane was the first (to study apes extensively in 
the wild) and her study is the longest-running. I read one poll that listed 
Jane Goodall as the most recognizable living scientist in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California this day, Goodall is treated like a star, asked 
repeatedly to sign autographs and spend time with bigwigs from the college. 
She's also scheduled to appear at a USC symposium on Friday, speaking on "The 
Independent and Interdependent Occupations of Chimpanzee Infants and Mothers." 
</P>
<P>
It's a topic dear to her and she works it in briefly at Santa Monica College 
when a student asks her if there's any way that aggressive, sometimes violent 
chimp behavior can help us to understand human violence. 
</P>
<P>
After having watched several generations of the Gombe chimps be born and 
eventually become mothers themselves, Goodall points out what she qualifies as 
"my own bias." It's that there are distinct effects of different types of 
mothering and early experience. In short, she's observed that if a mother chimp 
is "on the cold, harsh, asocial side" with her offspring, that youngster will 
be "less able to create meaningful, close relationships" with adults as he or 
she grows up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Necessary Aloofness 
</P>
<P>
Then asked if she herself is considered a "dominant female" by the chimps she's 
watched over the years, Goodall replies that she has gone to great lengths not 
to become part of the chimps' social group: "It would interfere with their 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
She also finds the idea extremely dangerous. "I've been attacked by adolescent 
males (chimps)," she said. "They'll attack basically anything that's moving and 
that includes wretched human observers." 
</P>
<P>
Goodall's questioners offer her no attacks, only respectful inquiries showing 
their appreciation of her work. As the day wears on and she faces smaller 
audiences of students, faculty members and patrons of the college, she remains 
animated as she answers questions she has addressed hundreds, perhaps thousands 
of times. 
</P>
<P>
She clearly knows the value of spreading the word. And that the antidote is not 
far off. 
</P>
<P>
"Going around on a tour like this, six weeks of constantly meeting people, 
lecturing, press interviews, it's very draining," she allows later, in a brief 
telephone conversation the next morning. "It leaves you feeling sort of empty, 
you know. When I go back to Dar es Salaam, there is a desk piled with letters 
and books to write and things that are overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I get to Gombe, it's utterly peaceful. It's what I consider to be the 
real world. It hasn't changed for thousands of years. There's nothing to give 
to . . . so you receive."

<TEXT>
   An 82-year-old house built by an explorer,
engineer and naturalist will become the new home of the institute
that supports naturalist Jane Goodall, famous for her 28 years of
chimpanzee research.
   A variance allowing the Jane Goodall Institute to use the house
for its offices, a museum and a classroom was approved Wednesday by
the Tucson Board of Adjustment.
   The house was built by Godfrey Sykes, founder of the local
Desert Laboratory. He named it Dar es Salaam after the East African
port city he visited in 1912, said Georgiana Boyer, Sykes'
granddaughter. She said the name means ``haven of peace'' in Arabic.
   Dar es Salaam also happens to be where Ms. Goodall lives when
she's not following chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in
Tanzania.
   ``I was amazed, just totally amazed _ it just seemed unreal _
when I heard that this house was called Dar es Salaam,'' Ms.
Goodall said in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   The institute functions as Goodall's U.S. office and arranges
her annual lecture tour.
   The new headquarters will include a museum and a library
featuring Ms. Goodall's handwritten field notebooks of chimpanzee
behavior.

<TEXT>  Birute Galdikas; By Sy Montgomery; Houghton Mifflin, 280 pp., $19.95; HERE  is
a sensitive and revealing contribution to the legend of a unique scientific
sisterhood: three pioneering women who were recruited by paleoanthropologist
Louis Leakey to go to the jungle and study the great apes for links to
humanity.;    Leakey believed women made the best observers, and that Goodall,
an Englishwoman, Fossey, an American who later was slain, and Galdikas, a
Canadian of Lithuanian extraction, had the grit to endure and the compassion
to love, respectively, the chimpanzees of Tanzania, the mountain gorillas of
Rwanda and the orangutans of Borneo.;    Sy Montgomery ably tells how Leakey's
passionate "trimates," as the primate researchers were dubbed, instinctively
violated scientific taboos and became nurturers, friends and defenders of
their study animals. This was the best way, she argues, to gain entree to the
secret lives of species that until then had been clouded in ignorance and
misunderstanding.;    The point, of course, is arguable, but the trimates were
superb. Goodall, genteel and diplomatic; Galdikas, tough and prickly; Fossey,
quirky and ruthlessly honest -- they all gave new mean-; ing to interpretive
science. Their controversial approach was totally different, based on a
privileged trust, a "contract . . . not written by the human: the animals are
the authors of the agreement.";    The three women stoutly defended their
animals and often debated each other about whose species was the most
humanlike. Skeptics would argue that such thinking, and the highly emotional
and personalized research it spawned, amounts to Darwinism in reverse, as if
chimps, gorillas and orangutans in effect were descended from man.;     Early
on, attacks on Goodall as a scientist were sexist. She was dismissed as a
"blond bimbo," her editor at National Geographic recalled. Galdikas tells how
a female professor assessed Goodall's career: "The only reason she's so famous
is because of her great legs in those short shorts in the films." Of course,
Galdikas' own image was similar.;    Today, only Goodall is accepted as a true
scientist. Galdikas hasn't published any data in 12 years. She saves
orangutans and preserves habitat. Married to a Dyak forester, by whom she has
had two children, she lives the life of a middle-aged rain-forest queen.;   
Fossey was driven to distraction by those who kept killing what she came to
regard as her gorillas. She wept at cruelty, wept at the courage displayed by
animals, wept at the uncaring attitude of native Africans. But as Montgomery
notes, an African, unless his or her tribal heritage had been modified by
Western education, would have laughed.;    So Fossey fought back with
anti-poaching squads, tortured poachers, burned their possessions, even
kidnapped their children. In 1985, she paid with her life. Martyrdom, perhaps,
may accomplish what she herself couldn't. (box)  </TEXT>

INTERVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A. That's right. I made some deliberate decisions based on watching chimpanzee
mothers and infants over the years. My observations helped me understand the
importance of early experience, and the tremendous difference it can make to a
child, depending on the type of mothering he or she gets. Watching the chimps
gave me some understanding of the importance of having a really good amount of
time to spend with my son. And that this might be crucial to how he developed
when he grew older. I also saw how much fun the chimp mothers had with their
infants. I didn't want to be deprived of that. So actually I stopped following
chimps when my son was small. In the mornings I did administration, and in the
afternoon -- that was his time. For three years I never spent a single night
away from him.;    Q. In your book you mention that male chimpanzees do not
have much respect for human women.;    A. That's right, they don't. For
example, one male, Goblin, would often come and hit and pound on me. He
wouldn't do that to men. It has something to do with fear: They're less
frightened of women. I think it may also have something to do with the voice;
the male's deeper voice sounds more like their threat call. I remember we had
two visitors, a man and a woman. They had just arrived and were staying inside
a tent. The woman spoke, and the chimps stayed where they were. When the man
spoke, they ran away.;    Q. Did it surprise you to discover how warlike
chimps are?;    A. It shocked me at first. It shouldn't have surprised me,
though, because chimpanzees are so like us in every way. Why wouldn't we
expect them to have a dark side to their nature? So I'm afraid it's likely
that we do have these aggressive, territorial traits, which stem directly from
our ancient primate heritage. That doesn't mean, however, that we have to go
on being warlike, because we can control those impulses.;    Q. What are the
most striking similarities between chimps and man?;    A. Do I dare say male
dominance? I'm half kidding, but actually it is interesting that some male
chimpanzees will devote a tremendous amount of energy, and run serious risks,
to get to the top. But unlike most animal species, where getting to the top
gives you definite reproductive advantage -- you get more access to the
females, in other words -- that's not necessarily true for the chimps. So
perhaps we're not the only creature where power for power's sake is an end.
There are also similarities in non-verbal communication.;    Q. Like what?;   
A. Like kissing, embracing, patting on the back, holding hands. And they do
these things in the same context as we do them, and they seem to mean the same
sort of things. Another similarity is that chimpanzees use so many objects as
tools. They roll leaves into sort of straws to suck termites out of their
nests, for example, and they use crumbled leaves to sop up water, like a
sponge. They also use leaves like napkins. Most fascinating of all, in
different parts of Africa where chimps are being studied, there are different
tool-using cultures. For example, in the Mahale Mountains, 100 miles south of
Gombe, the chimps have learned to eat the wood-boring carpenter ants. They
poke little twigs into holes in the trees, the ants swarm out, and they eat
them. In Gombe, they have the same ants, but the chimps haven't worked out how
to eat them. They haven't hit upon it. So you can imagine that some chimp
genius of the past hit upon these things, and the local chimps learned by
observation, imitation and practice. They have the beginnings of culture, in
other words.;    Q. I got the feeling from your book that you believe that the
major difference between chimps and humans isn't intelligence, but language.
Is that true?;    A. Yes, absolutely. It's very hard to imagine doing the
things we do without language. If you have some idea in your head, you know
how words crystallize that idea? Well, we know that chimps have a lot of
cognitive ability; we've been able to teach them sign language. But if they
get ideas about something, which I'm sure they do, it's trapped inside. They
can't discuss it.;    Q. How far have chimpanzees come with sign language?;   
A. They can learn 300 or more signs. They'll make up labels for something they
don't know the name for. I remember at one point one of the chimps kept asking
a person on our staff for a "rock berry." The chimp kept making the two signs
for "rock" and "berry." This person had no idea what she meant, but it turned
out that two days earlier someone had given the chimp a brazil nut, which the
chimp had never seen before. And that was it. The chimp had put those two
words together to describe what she wanted.  </TEXT>

PRIMATE VISIONS GENDER, RACE, AND NATURE IN THE WORLD OF MODERN SCIENCE BY 
DONNA J. HARAWAY (ROUTLEDGE: $35; 472 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-415-90114-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Sperling, Sperling is a physical anthropologist and author of Animal 
Liberators: Research and Morality (1988, University of California Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Primate Visions" is about the ways in which scientific accounts of the lives 
of animals -- specifically those most closely related to us -- are intertwined 
with our concepts of gender, race, and nature. Depictions of monkeys and apes 
tell us much about ourselves, or, to paraphrase Pogo: "We have met the 
primates, and they are us." Both scientific accounts and popular images of 
monkeys and apes reflect sometimes-disturbing projections of human problems. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway precedes from the assumption that monkeys and apes occupy the crucial 
border zone between culture and nature; in the book we see them catapulted into 
space, taught to communicate with humans, or portrayed as symbols of "lost 
innocence" in a Third World devoid of indigenous human actors. In this 
mythological terrain, a lone white girl named Jane meets the innocent ape and 
both are transfigured. Through Haraway's lens, we see that the National 
Geographic vision of Africa bears a stronger resemblance to Disney World than 
to the African reality -- it is a theme park of the late 20th-Century 
industrial West's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway is chairman of the history of consciousness program at UC Santa Cruz, 
and a leading figure in post-modern deconstructionism. "Primate Visions" is 
about the way in which scientific accounts reflect and create our natural 
cosmology. Haraway is at her best when she monkeys brilliantly with some of our 
most precious symbols, at her worst when her language is inaccessible to a 
layperson not steeped in post-modern criticism. This is an important book that 
deserves the widest possible audience. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the book historically contextualizes the modern view of 
primates. In a chapter entitled "Teddy Bear Patriarchy" we are led through the 
great halls of the American Museum of Natural History. Here, Teddy Roosevelt's 
patriarchal ideals of manhood are reflected in the African Hall dioramas in 
which stuffed animals are mounted in family groupings to symbolize the "purity 
of nature." African Hall was the work of Carl Akeley, the artist, scientist and 
hunter who collected and stuffed African animals beginning in the 1880s. "From 
the dead body of the primate Akeley crafted something finer than the living 
organism; he achieved its true end, a new genesis. Decadence -- the threat of 
the city, civilization, machine -- was stayed in the politics of eugenics and 
the art of taxidermy." 
</P>
<P>
The magnificent silverback male gorilla of which Haraway writes, was killed in 
1921, the same year the museum hosted a large international gathering of 
eugenicists. She connects the vision in the dioramas to the obsession with 
"genetic hygiene" of many early 20th-Century Americans and Europeans. Like the 
dioramas, eugenics contrasted the woes of civilization with the goodness of 
nature. By showing us African Hall as "simultaneously a very strange place and 
an ordinary experience for literally millions of North Americans" Haraway 
points out how strange our ordinary reality is. No one who has read "Teddy Bear 
Patriarchy" will ever experience a trip to the Museum of Natural History in 
quite the same way as before. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway devotes later chapters to modern primate field and laboratory studies. 
She connects the portrayals of white women watching apes in the Third World to 
First World anxieties about African decolonization. We read what is left out of 
the National Geographic accounts: Jane Goodall and her mother making 2,000 Spam 
sandwiches for Belgian troops fleeing their former colony; a cage constructed 
for Goodall's son, to protect him from the chimpanzees. National Geographic 
omits the African political context in which Goodall's work took place. 
</P>
<P>
In a final section of the book, Haraway presents biographies of four modern 
primatologists -- all of them women. It is probably not coincidental that 
primatology is the only branch of evolutionary studies with a predominance of 
successful women practitioners. Women are identified with nature and figure 
importantly in the mythological construction of the primate Garden of Eden. 
Women primatologists have contested male-centered origin stories by placing 
female monkeys and apes center stage in their accounts, and emphasizing female 
primate agency. 
</P>
<P>
Because Haraway is interested in reading primatology as text, she avoids 
questions about what is scientific fact versus poorly supported theoretical 
speculation. One primatologist whose work Haraway discusses is a leading 
proponent of sociobiology (the theory that animals and humans follow strategies 
that insure that the greatest number of their own genes will survive in future 
generations). The primatologist speaks of female monkeys, apes and humans as 
competitive, assertive, dominance- oriented and looking out for their own 
genetic advantage. It seems that female primates of the 1980s have taken their 
places in the board room of primate troops that resemble corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway points out the ways in which this new image of female primates mirrors 
late 20th-Century capitalist society. But sociobiology has been criticized for 
its failure to document actual behavior across the primate life cycle. Because 
a researcher seems to tell a good "feminist" story (i.e. that female primates 
are strategists for their own genetic advantage) does not mean that the work is 
good science. Sociobiology is genetic reductionism. It implies that gendered 
behaviors are controlled by genes. There is much evidence that this is not the 
case for humans, apes or monkeys. While all scientific stories may be read as 
myth, some are also poor science. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging and engaging, "Primate Visions" holds up a mirror to some of our 
favorite myths about animals. It shows us that we are not innocent; a Sunday at 
the museum or an evening in front of television are laden with meanings and 
deep ambiguities at the heart of our ideas about human and animal.

   Undersea explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau said
Thursday the six children he took along on his recent mission to
Antarctica sometimes had a sweet view of what constitutes a good
time.
   During one jampacked day when the group went to see colonies of
penguins, seals and other creatures from the ice continent, they
stopped at a Polish research station on the way back to their ship.
   Cousteau said when he asked one of the children if he'd had a
good day, the child replied: ``Oh, it was great. They gave us
cookies at the Polish station.''
   Cousteau left Jan. 3 from Chile for Antarctica with one child
from each of the six other continents. The children, ages 11 and
12, returned to Chile on Sunday.
   The mission was meant to symbolize that ``Antarctica belongs to
future generations, not to us,'' he said.
   The Cousteau Society has joined an international initiative
sponsored by the French and Australian governments to declare
Antarctica a ``natural reserve and land of science'' and ban mining
or other industrial activities.
   Cousteau said they built an igloo _ ``a symbolic home'' _ while
there and some group members slept one night in it.
   ``The next morning we brought them a big thermos of hot
chocolate and cakes,'' he said. ``They were happy like clams.''

   Mick Jagger said ``any day now'' he'd marry Jerry
Hall. That was back in 1983, but Hall said Thursday she and the
Rolling Stone now both think it's a fine idea after two kids and 12
years together.
   ``For the first time, we both think marriage is a good thing,''
Ms. Hall told reporters at the Lyric Theater, where she will be
starring in ``Bus Stop,'' with singer Shaun Cassidy.
   The Texas-born model and actress refused to confirm that her
large diamond ring was an engagement present from the rock singer,
who is in the Caribbean.
   ``He gives me a ring like this about once a year,'' she said.
   Hall and Jagger have two children: Elizabeth Scarlett, 5, and
Leroy Augustine, 3.
   Ms. Hall appeared in ``Bus Stop'' in 1988 in New Jersey, and the
British production will open next week in suburban Watford before
moving to London in February.

   Jane Goodall, who pioneered the study of
primates in the wild, is joining the University of Southern
California faculty.
   The British ethnologist will give occasional lectures and
seminars as Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Anthropology and
Occupational Science, the university said Thursday.
   She also will take graduate students into her various programs
worldwide. Ms. Goodall, 56, who gained international acclaim during
30 years of research in Tanzania and for her close-contact studies
of wild chimpanzees, will bring the university the most
comprehensive records of animal behavior ever compiled.
   The materials represent ``really one of the most important
ethnographic resources in the world,'' USC anthropologist Gary
Seaman said.
   The facilities offered to organize her research materials was an
important factor in her decision to join USC, Ms. Goodall said.
   She was born in London and lives in Tanzania. In the early 1970s
she was a visiting professor at Stanford and served as curator of
mammals at the California Academy of Sciences from 1985 to 1987.

   Dethroned hotel queen Leona Helmsley is
free pending appeal of a four-year sentence for tax evasion, but
that didn't stop reporters from touring a prison she might get sent
to if she does have to serve time.
   Khaki-clad inmates waved at cameras and shouted advice Wednesday
for the woman who could end up their neighbor in the low- to
medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury.
   ``You're going to get a new life here,'' shouted one of the 165
female inmates. There are also about 1,100 men in the prison.
   ``It's a nice camp. No bars, no guns and she would have her
privacy and be treated as all other inmates,'' said Sylvia Jenkins,
52.
   Another inmate, Cora Cressey, 65, said the place was more like
boot camp.
   Prison officials stressed that no final decision has been made
on where Helmsley would be imprisoned if her appeal fails.
   Helmsley, convicted on 33 counts of income tax evasion, was
sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million.

   Actress Loretta Swit will help raise money for a
new play area for five ``talking'' chimpanzees, which researchers
at Central Washington University say are the first non-humans to
learn sign language.
   Swit and Gov. Booth Gardner were scheduled hosts for a $150 per
plate fund-raiser Thursday night, which was to include wild
chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall.
   The effort is for the Washoe Project at the campus in
Ellensburg, about 125 miles to the east.
   Washoe is the pioneering chimp who was the first animal ever to
learn a human language, said researcher Roger Fouts.
   The Legislature approved $1.5 million to build the chimpanzees a
new home. They had been living on the third floor of a university
building. But lawmakers didn't include money for a recreation area.
   ``Washoe hasn't seen the sun in 10 years,'' Fouts said.

   Frustrated by a ban on importing chimpanzees, U.S. officials are looking into shifting AIDS tests on the animals to Africa and the Soviet Union, a move specialists call a needless death blow to the last chimps in the wild. 

   "This is very, very bad," said Jane Goodall, a leading chimpanzee specialist who was recently in Washington to alert legislators to the unannounced program. 
"It is not a choice of AIDS or chimps. 
Enough can be bred in captivity." 

   Sen. John Melcher (D., Mont.), a veterinarian, has threatened to block such a move. 

   The director of the National Institutes of Health, James Wyngaarden, confirmed in an interview that the government agency is considering acquired immune deficiency syndrome research projects in Africa and the Soviet Union, because U.S. law bans importation of chimpanzees. 

   "We clearly don't want to get into an international fracas over seeming to subvert rules that apply in this country," Mr. Wyngaarden said. 
But he added, "We're taking lots of looks at Africa." 

   He provided no specifics. 
But confidential minutes obtained by the Associated Press show that the National Institutes of Health decided quietly in March to identify target groups of African chimpanzees and explore means of using them in research. 

   According to the minutes, an NIH committee decided to develop "an African chimp field survey to provide us with the numbers of animals, serological (blood) information and (their) condition." 

   Possible sites for research include a laboratory in Liberia operated by the New York Blood Center and the Sukhumi center in Soviet Georgia, which would have to import chimps, as specialists say it now has none. 

   Chimps, which were instrumental in developing a hepatitis B vaccine, are valuable research subjects, because their genetic material varies less than 1% from that of humans. 
In current research, scientists are injecting chimps with experimental vaccines for AIDS. 

   Mr. Wyngaarden said NIH scientists want more chimpanzees than are available, but are thwarted by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the 14-year-old Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a treaty that prohibits trade in animals threatened with extinction. 

   Experts fear that, once in Africa, researchers would have access to chimpanzees smuggled illegally across borders from endangered colonies, sometimes with false documentation. 

   Ms. Goodall, the chimpanzee specialist, said new roundups of chimpanzees, during which hunters often kill adults to get at the young, "would not only have a devastating effect on chimpanzees but would bring them to extinction." 

   An average of 10 mothers and babies are killed for every infant chimp successfully exported, she said in a telephone interview from England. 

   Ms. Goodall and eight eminent U.S. and European biomedical specialists wrote to Nature magazine, saying that although chimpanzees were essential to AIDS research, enough could be bred for laboratory purposes. 

   "Going to Africa is no solution," Marc Girard of the Pasteur Institute in Paris said. 
"We must breed more, better use those we have, and find alternatives." 

   Geza Teleki, an American primatologist who heads a Washington-based international specialist group, the Committee for Conservation and Care of Chimpanzees, said too little has been done to breed captive chimps, and contended, "The bottom line is competition for the few chimpanzees still hanging on in Africa, and to hell with all the national and international laws protecting them." 

   A 1978 chimpanzee census commissioned by NIH showed chimp populations gone from or depleted across much of their traditional African range. 
The unpublished census was made public recently by specialists. 

   Most chimpanzees in medical research originated in West Africa, where their number has dropped this century from a million to about 17,000, one specialist said. 
Outside of West Africa, only Zairean and South African authorities control large groups of chimps. 
"The NIH clearly intends to continue being an accomplice in driving the species to extinction beyond the view of the American public," the specialist asserted. 

   Sen. Melcher said he opposes such a transfer of U.S. chimpanzee research to Africa. 
"NIH is going to have to abide by international agreement," he said, warning that Congress could block any move "offshore" by inserting restrictions in NIH appropriations. 

   The number of chimpanzees already used in U.S. research is in dispute. 

   Mr. Wyngaarden said only 400 to 600 chimps are available, and the infant mortality is 30% in breeding centers used by NIH. 

   But Jan Moor-Jankowski, director of Lemsip, a large primate-research facility in New York, challenged these figures, saying that NIH has access to 800 animals and that more than 100 are born each year, a number that could be increased.

<HEAD>Local Heroes: PBS Series Shows Individuals Make a Difference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Do not despair. The world is not coming to an
end. Individuals can make it a better place. That's the good news
these days from public television.
   Still, you're in no immediate danger of contracting that warm,
fuzzy feeling from programs like ``Local Heroes, Global Change,'' a
four-part documentary series opening on PBS tonight.
   ``What we have learned is that the world is extremely complex,
messy, that simple solutions and slogans don't work,'' said
Francisco Sagasti, head of strategic planning for the World Bank in
Washington.
   ``Local Heroes'' is one of a number of programs on public TV
trying to show what smart, committed people can do against hunger,
poverty and pollution, especially in developing nations.
   Using these people, PBS programmers and independent producers
can relate complex stories without oversimplifying them.
   ``There's been a lot of talk among programmers about doing news
from the bottom up rather than the top down,'' said Harry Chancey,
top programmer for PBS affiliate WNET in New York City. ``There's a
sense of excitement about letting the unremarkable people tell the
story.''
   The first episode of ``Local Heroes, Global Change'' considers
rice farming in Indonesia, where farmers learned that ecologically
balanced insect populations could supplant the government's
disastrous pesticide program.
   It also looks at a near-revolutionary loan program of the
Grameen (Rural) Bank of Bangladesh, which targets women and the
landless for loans to buy livestock and homes.
   The other episodes of the South Carolina ETV series will
consider the influences of politics, psychology and the global
economy on Third World development.
   The PBS series ``Profiles in Progress'' also focuses on local
heroes. A recent episode profiled Nepal, where deforestation and
infant mortality are interconnected issues of national survival.
   Nepal's infant mortality rate 20 years ago was 250 per 1,000
live births. Today, at 110 per thousand, it's still one of the
highest in the world. Yet the decrease and a traditionally high
birth rate have helped increase Nepal's population more than 50
percent since 1970, to 17 million people.
   That population puts pressure on the forests, the traditional
source of fuel and fodder. Since 1970, Nepal has lost one-third of
its forest, or 6 million acres of trees. Deforestation robs Nepal
of soil, beauty and, ultimately, the tourism that is a main source
of its foreign exchange.
   Its local heroes are Prabhakar Rana, a hotelier who pushes for
national game preserves and local forest management, and Dr. Yagya
Karki, a health official who produces videos on prenatal care and
midwifery, and enlists village women as advocates for family
planning.
   We can expect to see many more ``local heroes'' on PBS in the
weeks and months ahead. In October, Boston's WGBH will be offering
a 10-part series called ``The Race to Save the Planet.''
   Another kind of ``local hero'' is naturalist Jane Goodall, whose
30-year study of the chimpanzees of Tanzania's Gombe National Park
has expanded our understanding of human's closest relative.
   ``It's being there with the chimpanzees, being out of the rat
race, that gives me the energy to travel around lecturing and
meeting people,'' she says on HBO's documentary ``Chimps: So Like
Us,'' which airs on May 9.
   It's a beautifully photographed documentary on her work and her
deeply felt opposition to the inhumane use of chimps in medical
research.
   On May 20, TBS and the award-winning ``National Geographic
Explorer'' present ``The Life and Legend of Jane Goodall.''
   A little good news never hurt anybody.

   THE DISMAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT: ``Fear, Greed and the Madness of
Crowds'' is a funny, insightful and visually delightful examination
by ``Adam Smith's Money World'' at the irrational behavior of
markets over the centuries.
   It covers such egregious examples of economic fancy as the
tulipmania of 17th-century Holland, the South Sea bubble in
18th-century England and the Florida land boom of the '20s.
   Its droll, eye-popping graphics were designed on the Quantel

artists Todd Ruff and Sharon Haskell. Its first PBS air date is May
11, but check local listings.

Reading the article on Jane Goodall left me with a strange feeling 
("Spellbinding Advocate for Animals," by Beth Ann Krier, April 27). 
</P>
<P>
Most people know who Jane Goodall is, more people than saw "Gorillas in the 
Mist" I would venture to guess. National Geographic has always printed articles 
about her work and its importance to our understanding of human behavior in 
order that we perhaps could improve the quality of life on this planet. The 
writer of this article is using phrases and descriptions that are really in my 
opinion not at all appropriate to an article on Jane Goodall. "Seduces her 
audiences" . . . "her fine boned hand" . . . "slim and elegant with her gray 
hair pulled back in a simple ponytail . . . " these are fashion-like, artsy and 
shallow descriptions, not needed since there is a photograph on the front page. 
It really doesn't work for me in an article that should be informed and 
scientific.

   ``Jake's Women,'' a new Neil Simon comedy
starring Peter Coyote and Stockard Channing, will close in San
Diego before it reaches New York, a spokesman said.
   It is the first time a Simon play scheduled for Broadway
production has closed out-of-town, said spokesman Bill Evans on
Thursday.
   ``The show may very well arrive to New York in another version,
but this production won't,'' Evans said.
   ``Jake's Women'' was to have opened at the Neil Simon Theater in
New York on April 30. It will close April 15 at San Diego's Old
Globe Theater.
   The comedy, which Simon has called semiautobiographical,
concerns a writer who is still coming to terms with the death of
his first wife while his second marriage falls apart.
   Simon, whose Broadway hits include ``Barefoot in the Park,''
``The Odd Couple'' and ``Biloxi Blues,'' has had his share of flops
on the Great White Way, including ``Fools,'' ``God's Favorite'' and
the revival of ``Little Me.''

   British ethnologist Jane Goodall says her
work to save chimpanzees from extinction makes it easier for her to
put up with the state of the world's environment.
   ``If I look at the whole world picture, overpopulation,
pollution, the destruction of forests and so on, it's hard to be
happy,'' Goodall said in a recent interview with The Oregonian.
   ``It's better to concentrate on the things I'm actually involved
with. That makes it a bit easier.''
   Goodall was in Oregon to give lectures on chimpanzees, which now
number between 100,000 to 200,000 in the wild.
   ``If we lost the chimps from the wild, that would also mean all
the forest would be gone,'' she said. ``And where would we all be?''
   Goodall, 56, went to Tanzania in 1960 to study with
paleontologist Louis Leakey, who sent her to study the behavior of
chimpanzees at Gombe, Tanzania. She has devouted nearly 30 years to
the study of the primate.

   Ask rock singer Laura Branigan about ``sex on
the beach'' and she'll tell you it's a new drink.
   At least that's what she says she would pass along to rock lyric
critics such as Tipper Gore.
   Branigan said Friday that she would tell the wife of U.S. Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., that ``sex on the beach'' is a drink if
she had to explain the lyrics of the title track from her new album
``Moonlight on Water.''
   The song includes these lyrics: ``Instead of dreamin' about all
the money we got much simpler things to do. Moonlight on water. Sex
on the beach.''
   She said the lyrics represent more than sex.
   ``Sex on the beach is really, I think, more than the actual
physical act. It's the feeling of being with someone you care about
or a friend, or just alone on the beach stripping off your clothes
at night and going skinny dipping and, you know, just living for
the moment.''

   Romanian defector Nadia Comaneci has given her
first gymnastics performance in six years.
   Comaneci performed Thursday night before a near-capacity crowd
at the 1,800-seat Ziegfeld Theater inside Bally's Reno
hotel-casino. It was her first U.S. exhibition in nine years and
her first public performance since 1984.
   Fighting off tears, Comaneci told the crowd, ``I'm glad to be in
my new homeland. This is very emotional for me. ... I love America.
I love you all.''
   A cast of 16 younger gymnasts was in the performance, which was
taped by ABC Sports for broadcast April 21.
   The show's producer, Paul Ziert, said he's thinking of touring
with Comaneci.
   ``Nadia again is excited and motivated,'' Ziert said. ``She sees
that she can still do what she loves, that she can still be a part
of gymnastics.''
   Comaneci also was reunited with former coach Bela Karolyi, who
guided her to a series of perfect 10s and three gold medals in the
1976 Olympics in Montreal when she was 14.
   Karolyi defended the 28-year-old star from publicity over her
alleged tryst with a married man who helped her defect in December.
Karolyi, who defected 10 years ago, said she must have felt as he
did on his arrival in the United States.
   ``Ten years ago, I was standing in the streets of Los Angeles a
desperate man,'' he said. ``Ten years later, I believe Nadia was
just as desperate as me.''

<TEXT>     Delta Burke is keeping busy. Besides her "Love and Curses" TV movie that
recently aired, she's got "Dayo" upcoming. The NBC-TV movie that's slated to
go before the cameras Nov. 13 has her playing a housemate who becomes confused
and frustrated when she learns she is pregnant. From there on it gets weird --
as her life is thrown for a loop when her imaginary childhood playmate pays a
visit.; CROSS-ACTING: Kirstie Alley is doing her "Cheers" producers a favor
and making a guest appearance on their new "Flesh 'N Blood" series. Alley
tapes the segment next week and will play an old girlfriend of David Keith's.;
HELLO AGAIN: Howard Hesseman's Johnny Fever will become a recurring character
on the all-new syndicated "W.K.R.P. in Cincinnati" after all. When the show
first returned, Hesseman would only agree to appear in the two-part opener and
an occasional guest appearance. Now we're told, he's changed his mind in light
of the show's increasing popularity and has agreed to be a semi-regular.;
BEYOND HIS YEARS: "Wonder Years" star Fred Savage is set to narrate the voice
of a special guest character on the animated Saturday morning children's show
"Captain Planet and the Planeteers." In the Oct. 26 episode, 15-year-old
Savage provides the voice for Klek-Torr, a 70,000-year-old alien zoo keeper
who thinks humans are an endangered species whose habitat is about to be
destroyed.; INSIDE TRACK: Stevie Nicks will pay her personal tribute to
celebrated animal behaviorist Jane Goodall at The International Tribute to
Jane Goodall in Dallas Oct. 25. The former Fleetwood Mac member has written
"Jane's Song," a special tune for the event. Nicks says she was moved to write
a song in Goodall's honor after becoming aware of her research into the
cruelty experienced by chimpanzees in scientific experiments -- which include
shooting the primates with the AIDS virus. "Jane's Song" will appear on Nicks'
next solo album, with proceeds to go to the Jane Goodall Institute.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Naturalist Jane Goodall urged better treatment of chimpanzees in zoos and
laboratories during a stop at the Oakland zoo -- but there was somewhere she
would have rather been. "In a forest," Goodall said Monday during the
three-day ChimpanZoo conference, attended by almost 70 experts from U.S. zoos
trying to improve the lives of their chimps. "But after seeing how chimps are
treated, being killed, sold, studied in labs, that would be selfish of me,"
she said.  </LEADPARA>

FT  03 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Rights for apes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS A book that I think you ought to read, called The Great Ape
Project: Equality beyond Humanity. It is an important book for there is a
chance that if enough of us read it, and do something about it, good will
come of it - perhaps so much good that we will be able to ameliorate the
predicament of our own species by helping others.
Our closest relatives are chimpanzees. To put it another way, says Jared
Diamond, professor of physiology at the University of California,
chimpanzees' closest relatives are not gorillas but humans. The genetic
difference - 1.6 per cent - separating us from pygmy or common chimps is
barely double that separating pygmy from common chimp and less, for example,
than between such hard-to-distinguish European bird species as willow
warblers and chiffchaffs (2.6 per cent).
Despite our genetic closeness to the other great apes, we treat them badly.
Hence this book, in which 34 writers - scientists, philosophers, a lawyer, a
psychologist - anticipate a new stage in human development: a reassessment
of the moral status of chimps, gorillas and orang-utans and the acceptance
of some non-human animals as persons.
The authors want a declaration on great apes that welcomes them into a
'community of equals' and gives them various rights, enforceable at law,
including the right to life, protection of liberty and the prohibition of
torture.
At present, says the declaration, only some humans are regarded as members
of this community. But there is now no remaining moral or ethical argument
against extending it. 'History shows us,' the declaration maintains, 'that
there has always been, within our own species, that saving factor: a squad
of determined people willing to overcome the selfishness of their own group
in order to advance another's cause.'
I was so uplifted by The Great Ape Project that I scuttled round to London
Zoo to talk to one of the chimps, funnily enough named Michael.
With a bit of luck, I said, you will be out of here quite soon. There is a
groundswell of opinion among intelligent humans that holds that our
treatment of the great apes is similar to the way in which normally
compassionate people once condoned human slavery.
Jane Goodall, an expert on chimps, says that evidence for sophisticated
mental performances by apes has become ever more convincing, I continued.
They can solve simple problems with reasoning and insight. Can plan for the
immediate future. Experiments have demonstrated their powers of
generalisation, abstraction and concept-forming. They can use abstract
symbols to communicate. And they have some kind of self-concept.
The thing is, Michael, that the line dividing man from beast, 'us' from
'them,' has become blurred and disreputable. We are all in this together. I
know we are shuttling to oblivion on a pint-sized planet. But there is still
time for humans to make amends - to acknowledge your rights and protect you
from harm.
Michael snorted. He said: What makes you think we want to have anything more
to do with you than the absolute minimum? Your species is a disgrace. You
are wrecking yourselves and the planet.
I said: I suppose you mean our wars and nuclear adventurism and population
growth? Or even the little things, our pornography and hard drugs? Our
amazingly short-fused tempers?
That is only the start of it, said Michael. Apart from your ugliness and
cruelty there is all the rest: John Major, John Smith, your silly political
squabbling, prices at Sainsbury's, music critics, News At Ten, your
obsession with stupid ball games, blithering Virginia Wade, Thames Water -
the depthless banality of so many of your enterprises.
I said: Give us a break, Michael. We are still a young species. The last
common female ancestor of all living humans probably lived 150,000 years
ago. We are only 5,000 human generations old. This may explain our
defensiveness: our insistence on 'them' and 'us.' And we are not all bad.
I don't want to hear about the Sistine Chapel, growled Michael.
I don't mean that, I said. I mean that in most places we have at least
stamped out slavery, the exhibiting of deformed humans in circuses and
public hangings. We are trying to improve ourselves.
Michael turned away in disgust. He said: Tell that to the giraffes. They are
suckers for happy endings.

   In the tradition of Willie Nelson's Farm
Aid concerts, a Georgia businessman is lining up country western
entertainers to make a music video and record to benefit
financially pressed farmers.
   Chad Kramer of Atlanta said Friday he had been in touch with
Nelson's office because ``I felt a strong desire to keep things
going.''
   The project also is reminiscent of the ``We Are the World''
video and record in 1985, which raised money for African hunger
relief.
   Kramer said he has commitments from 20 recording artists who
plan to gather in Nashville June 6 to do a video of the song ``Lean
On Me,'' a 1972 hit by pop singer Bill Withers.
   Kramer said the participants include Tom Wopat, Tom T. Hall,
Eddy Raven, Jerry Jeff Walker, Johnny Rodriguez, Michael Johnson,
Skip Ewing, Larry Boone, Cristy Lane, Judy Rodman and Terri Gibbs.
Withers also will participate, Kramer said.
   Kramer projected proceeds at up to $4 million.

   Protests from anti-abortion activists and
the Roman Catholic Church forced the organizers of a medical
conference co-sponsored by a Catholic hospital to cancel an
appearance by Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
   The diminutive human sexuality expert was to discuss ``Sexuality
and the Medical Profession'' next week, but the address was
canceled after Saint Anthony Medical Center, a co-sponsor of the
event, received mail and phone calls protesting her appearance.
   The outspoken Westheimer, known as Dr. Ruth, is an author,
counselor, TV and radio talk show host, and a staunch advocate of
sex education.
   ``I think that she perhaps offended the sensibilities of members
of the Catholic Church with her stands on certain sexual topics,''
said Dr. Paul Maxwell, director of Continuing Medical Education at
Saint Anthony and head of a committee that chose speakers for the
conference. ``The problem seemed to be her public stance on
abortion, the use of condoms and other sensitive issues.''
   A spokesman for Westheimer said Friday that she believes people
who do not wish to hear her views should turn the dial.

   Jane Goodall, who comes out of Africa each year
to lecture and raise money for conservation research, says she is
concerned for the chimpanzees she has observed in Tanzania for 29
years.
   ``I feel a sense of growing urgency,'' Goodall said in an
address sponsored by the San Diego Zoological Society Thursday.
``The plight of the chimps in Africa is truly horrendous.''
   At the turn of the century, chimpanzees could be found in 25
African countries and numbered in the millions, she said. Today,
they are extinct in four of those countries and on the brink of
extinction in five others, said Goodall, 55.
   She said if chimpanzees are to survive in the wild there must be
fundamental changes, including an all-out effort to discourage
private ownership as pets as well as encouraging medical science to
seek alternative methods of research.

   Convicted murderer Jean Harris must turn over
$90,000 in profits from her autobiography to a board that dispenses
cash to crime victims.
   The state Crime Victims Board argued successfully that under
state law, profits from the book, ``Stranger in Two Worlds,''
should benefit survivors of Dr. Herman Tarnower, the man Mrs.
Harris killed.
   Mrs. Harris sought to donate the money to a fund for the
children of inmates at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility,
where she is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence for the March 1979
murder of the creator of the Scarsdale diet.
   The prison charity argued in a lawsuit that garnishing the money
would violate Mrs. Harris's constitutional rights. But state court
Justice Israel Rubin disagreed, ruling Thursday in the board's
favor.
   The money will be placed in escrow for up to five years. Under
the law, survivors of Tarnower must obtain a civil judgment in
order to obtain the money. If none comes forward, it will be
returned to Mrs. Harris.
   Mrs. Harris, 65, has written another book about her prison
experiences, ``They Always Call Us Ladies,'' which is not covered
by the state law because it does not discuss the murder of
Tarnower, her longtime lover.

   Fashion designer Oleg Cassini failed to
ride a winner in his first two races of the year at Freehold
Raceway, but, as he said, it could have been worse.
   In one race, Cassini's horse broke stride for a while and
another won easily. The second horse he jockeyed rallied from
fourth place to challenge the pacesetter at the half-mile pole, but
finished fifth.
   ``He could not catch up to the leaders, but I was very happy to
earn a check with him for fifth place,'' the 76-year-old Cassini
said Friday after his second race of the day. ``I am also happy
that I did not finish last in either race. Now that I am back in
action I hope to do better the next time I drive.''

It has more than a few hearty laughs, which is all I ask of any sitcom.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Herman (William Ragsdale) is a would-be writer, working in the research
department of a big magazine. Basically, he's a nice young guy with all the
usual complications of the young -- career frustrations, romantic
uncertainties and what have you. From the outside, it looks as if he's
handling it all with a certain panache.;   But inside Herman's head, there's a
war going on: The "Animal" part of his nature (Ken Hudson Campbell) urges him
to jump the bones of all those sexy women in the office, while his sensitive
inner "Angel" (Molly Hagan) begs him to show more respect to women; the timid
"Wimp" (Rick Lawless) side of him asks him to remember what Mom might say; and
his intellectual "Genius" (Peter MacKenzie) component stuffily reminds him any
gross behavior is beneath him anyway.;   Naturally, with the odds stacked in
that manner, Herman tends to stay more congenial than courageous. Still, that
animal side does put up a pretty noisy argument from time to time.;   In
Sunday's premiere show, Herman's animal side acts up something awful when his
best pal's girlfriend (Corinne Bohrer) turns to him for solace, and all he can
think about is how to get her undressed while seeming thoughtful, considerate
and harmless.;   At first, it will seem awkward to keep shifting from Herman's
"real" world to the comfortable rec room in his noodle. But there's enough fun
in there to make it worth the necessary adjustments.;   All the "emotions" are
well cast, but the characters in Herman's daily life are even more promising.
Herman's pal Jay (Hank Azaria) is a very self-confident hustler. Office mate
Heddy (Jane Sibbett) is a deadly combination: gorgeous, but ruthless. The
boss, Mr. Bracken (Jason Bernard), acts like he always has a whip in his hand,
but he's reasonably fair-minded.;   My favorite is Louise (Yeardley Smith),
the eager office flunky, who's a real character. Smith is one of the season's
brightest newcomers. If her voice sounds familiar, that's probably because you
hear it every week on Fox's "The Simpsons," where she speaks for Bart's
sax-blowing sister, Lisa. She's even funnier speaking for herself.;   (Perky
Corinne Bohrer, so charming in Sunday's show, won't be a regular. She has left
to co-star with James Garner in his new NBC sitcom, "Man of the People.");  
"Herman's Head" could go stale if the writers don't keep the comedy frisky
enough, but I think the elements are there for a hit. It's certainly
innovative enough to shine brightly in an otherwise dull season.;   Amazing
chimps; Fans of TV nature shows should prepare themselves for a very moving
experience Sunday night, when cable's Discovery Channel airs its first
feature-length documentary of the fall season, "People of the Forest: The
Chimps of Gombe.";   Filmed in Tanzania over a 20-year period by acclaimed
wildlife cinematographer Hugo van Lawick, "People of the Forest" is the saga
of a single family of chimpanzees, surviving in an environment that is more
threatened each year.;   Incorporating the research of his famous former wife,
Jane Goodall, van Lawick has created a dramatic epic of the animal world that
can't fail to captivate all fans of this TV genre.;   We first meet the female
Fifi at age 25 in her habitat at the Gombe preserve, where she lives as the
senior female of the dominant family in the colony of 50 or so chimps. Then
van Lawick takes us back 20 years to her childhood.;   Fifi's story is both
humorous and tragic, but always heartwarming as we see her grow to maturity
among her kinfolk. Her life is filled with luminous characters, including her
patient 45-year-old mother, Flo; her ambitious and competitive brothers, Faben
and Figan; and her "spoiled" little brother, Flint.;   You'll see truly
amazing things, such as the cruel passage of a polio epidemic through the
colony and the heartbreaking decline of a chimp who actually dies from grief
over the loss of a loved one.;   The overwhelming message of van Lawick's
extraordinary film is that the chimps of Gombe truly are "people" with a
structured society and a full array of familiar emotions. It makes their grim
future as pawns of humankind even harder to take.;   Local guy goes Showtime;
Mark Schiff is pretty much a regular at San Jose comedy clubs. (He's due back
in November.) He's also one of the more promising of the younger stand-up
comics in America. So tonight he joins the flock of stand-ups given their own
comedy specials by the Showtime pay-TV network.;   In tonight's 10:30 outing,
"Mark Schiff: My Crummy Childhood," Schiff is found performing live before a
largely student crowd at New York University, the perfect audience for his
lively, youth-oriented act.;   Schiff's act is basically clean-cut and warmly
nostalgic, with lots of gags about shopping at supermarkets ("Paper or
plastic?"), living with pets ("I used to kiss my dog until one day I caught
him licking himself") and, of course, his family ("Grandmas have the biggest
underwear -- on the planet").;   This isn't a show filled with heavy yuks, but
Schiff is inventive and easy to take -- just the sort of young comic that you
can be sure will go on to bigger and better things real soon. See him now, and
brag later about how you caught him in his formative years.  </TEXT>

PEACE: A BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE FOR PRIMATES?

In "Peacemaking Among Primates," Frans de Waal calls attention to an important 
but recently overlooked perspective in ethology, the study of the evolution of 
behavior. A relatively new science, ethology incorporates theories of behavior 
that go back at least 200 years, when scientists first looked to the natural 
world for a blueprint of the social contract, the basis for human behavior. 
Since then, they have moved from the picture of man as a "noble savage," born 
into an Eden and then corrupted, to the post-Darwinian vision of man as another 
animal subject to fierce competition for limited resources in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
On a January day in 1880, a different view came to the attention of Peter 
Kropotkin, known historically as the ideologue of anarchism, when he heard 
about a lecture presented at the Russian Congress of Naturalists by a 
well-known zoologist, who suggested that besides the law of mutual struggle -- 
species locked in a gladiatorial battle for existence -- there was a 
corresponding and even more important law of mutual aid. Three years later, 
Kropotkin read the same suggestion in Darwin's "The Descent of Man" and set to 
work collecting data, which he published, in 1902, as "Mutual Aid," a chronicle 
of cooperative behavior in the progressive evolution of the species. 
</P>
<P>
Kropotkin reissued "Mutual Aid" in 1915 in order to set the record straight. He 
insisted that the war then destroying civilization as he knew it was not 
inevitable. People cooperate even under siege, he argued: Witness the peasant 
women who thrust bread and apples into the hands of German and Austrian 
prisoners as they trudged through the streets of Kiev. Mutual aid, he asserted, 
is a necessary correlative of competition among social animals, including human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
But this optimistic view of nature did not win much favor as the 20th Century 
continued with wars and genocide expanded to levels previously unimagined. 
Biologists and ethologists, along with psychologists and sociologists, sought 
the roots of this violence in the evolutionary past. 
</P>
<P>
The roots were not hard to find. Violence is dramatic and easy to document. 
Tracking hostile behaviors in other species fulfilled the expectations of those 
who read these acts as a genetic necessity, a selection of evolution. However, 
while aggression is a successful adaptation among other species, it becomes a 
fatal flaw in humans who still react instinctively, hair standing on end, 
adrenaline flowing, to hostile movements, responding with nuclear weapons 
instead of sharpened canines. 
</P>
<P>
The late Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian ethologist of enormous stature, observed 
that an animal must be aggressive to compete successfully, and he reasoned that 
aggression has biological roots. This concept, which he explored in "On 
Aggression," published in English in 1966, inspired a generation of scientists. 
Perhaps as an effort to universalize the atrocities of the war he had lived 
through in Germany, Lorenz defined aggression as the starting point of all 
social relationships. Aggression inspires hierarchy, community, and among 
non-human species controls the dispersion of resources. But among humans, he 
asserted, it is out of control. As a species we have run amok because we do not 
have the inhibition to control our aggressive instinct. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz's work was followed by a spate of books and articles testifying to the 
biological, hormonal and psychological basis of aggression in human beings. The 
consensus seemed to be that we come equipped with a runaway instinct, one that 
suited our ancestors on the savannah, but in the world of advanced weaponry 
seems to doom us to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Awash in this news about the aggressive nature of animals in general and 
primates in particular, ethologists such as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey began 
to document intra-species killings, even cannibalism, among those apes we had 
all learned to love because of their gentle nature. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal rejects this pessimistic and one-sided picture of the human 
predicament. "Peacemaking Among Primates" can be seen as a delayed, and 
infinitely more sophisticated, sequel to Kropotkin's attempt to describe with 
scientific accuracy the centripetal forces that keep societies together as well 
as the centrifugal ones that drive them apart. It also is an elucidation and 
expansion of Lorenz's views, accepting the reality of aggression but positing 
it as only one side of the coin. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal is both a revisionist and an optimist. Indeed, he concedes that 
primates fight. But at least as often they avoid clashes that could lead to 
fights; and when they do fight, they make peace with their adversaries so that 
the community continues as before. He documents this assertion with detailed 
studies of five primate groups including chimpanzees, macaques and human 
beings, using data he has meticulously collected over more than a decade. He 
confirms in the idiom of a modern ethologist what Kropotkin could only surmise: 
that mutual aid has enabled primates to evolve complex and viable social 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal demonstrates that science can be like poetry: Once a truth is stated, 
our vision shifts and we cannot imagine how we did not see it before. We join 
De Waal in the public observation post at Arnhem Zoo in The Netherlands, above 
the largest colony of chimpanzees in captivity. De Waal knows each individual 
by name and personality (and has already written about them in an earlier book, 
"Chimpanzee Politics"). Familiar with their frequent fights, he realized in a 
moment of inspiration that their conflicts always ended in reconciliations that 
left most relationships repaired and normalized. Along with his colleagues, he 
had been blind for years to what had been happening before their eyes. Thus he 
began to study the nature of reconciliation, of peacemaking among these 
chimpanzees. 
</P>
<P>
From the chimps at Arnhem, he went on to study peacemaking among rhesus and 
stump-tailed macaques at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center where 
he is now a research scientist; among bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees), in the 
unique group at the San Diego Zoo; and among human beings. He discovered 
similar patterns of peacemaking among the five groups of primates. He also 
discovered a blindness among other scientists to the study of peacemaking. He 
describes a world- renowned psychologist, a specialist in human aggression, who 
grew irritated at the suggestion that evolution has anything to do with 
explaining behavior, and had not even considered the possibility that conflicts 
are inevitable among people because aggression has a long evolutionary history, 
and that reconciliation is worth studying because it is logical to expect the 
co-evolution of powerful coping mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that psychologist will read his book. The evidence is overwhelming that 
we share with other primates the mechanisms for fighting, but also the need for 
friendship, support, body contact and even sexual activity as a social 
function, and to get these we, too, have evolved mechanisms for face-saving, 
for compromise, for consolation and for reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now -- and this is the heart of his message -- most scientists have 
believed that violence is more integral to human nature than peace. In reality, 
he demonstrates, we have highly developed strategies for consolation and 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal brings a new perspective to a discipline that has been dominated in the 
English-speaking world by self-consciously detached observers as well as by 
those who see animals as a gene's device to reproduce itself. De Waal also 
rejects the approach that science starts with a battery of hypotheses which are 
dispassionately tested. He points out that Darwin didn't set sail to test a 
theory. Rather, he returned with the ingredients to make one. 
</P>
<P>
Theory never takes precedence over his personal observations, one of which led 
him to reject the extrapolation of the famous crowded-rat experiment to the 
human condition. In this experiment, caged rats that were pushed closer and 
closer together eventually went mad and turned cannibal. But De Waal notes that 
vervet monkeys crowded together simply avoid eye contact and look at the sky 
and ground a lot. The same could be said for his countrymen who, while living 
in one of the most densely packed nations on earth, enjoy low crime rates and a 
high degree of personal tolerance. Primates are one thing, rats another. 
</P>
<P>
As a Dutchman, de Waal also is especially careful about English, the way a 
person must be whose native language is not the lingua franca of any major 
discipline. He distinguishes carefully between the words "aggression" and 
"violence," the latter being the most extreme but not the most common form of 
the former. He also distinguishes between "consolation," the act of support by 
a bystander to the victim of a hostile encounter, and "reconciliation," 
peacemaking between the actors in the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal's observations are wide-ranging, surprising and invariably provocative. 
With increased knowledge of primate behavior, he worries about the ways some 
zoos isolate these highly social creatures. From observations that male 
primates participate in acts of reconciliation more frequently than do females, 
he wonders if males are generally more conciliatory than females, and 
speculates on the differences between the sexes in our own species. 
</P>
<P>
This gracefully written book is unabashedly political, referring frequently to 
contemporary issues to make a point. Concerned about survival, De Waal in 1986 
signed the Seville Statement which asserted that "Biology does not condemn 
humanity to war." But unlike the other signatories, who felt that we could rise 
above our biological destiny (through intelligence, one supposes, and 
restraint), De Waal believes it is that very biological heritage that provides 
us with the mechanisms of reconciliation which he urges us to develop. We are 
creatures of evolution, and have arrived where we are because we are able to 
control and channel our aggressions. Peacemaking is not only desirable, it is, 
in a sense, evolutionarily prescribed.

   A medical research laboratory targeted by
animal welfare activists faces a $2,500 for harassing two
Agriculture Department inspectors at the facility during a 1987
visit.
   The Agriculture Department's chief administrative judge, Victor
W. Palmer, on Monday ordered Sema Inc. to comply with ``every
provision of the Animal Welfare Act'' and not to interfere with
federal inspections.
   Animal rights activists claim the suburban Washington lab
mistreats its chimpanzees and other animals used in viral research
under contract with the National Institutes of Health.
   The two veterinary inspectors who work for the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service said company employees prevented them
from taking pictures of cages, decoding information about the
animals and driving away from the lab on June 29, 1987.
   In a follow-up report at the lab, the inspectors reported
finding deficiencies in sanitation that were ``suggestive of
violations'' of regulations, but concluded Sema did not violate the
welfare act.
   Sema President John Landon and his attorney declined comment on
the order until they saw it writing.
   The company has 35 days to appeal the decision.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is based in
Washington, has publicly shown films it claims were taken at Sema
during a burglary, allegedly by an underground animal rights group.
Chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall has also publicly criticized the
company about the size of cages and other treatment of chimps there.
   Sema had a $1.5 million-a-year contract with NIH for research
into simian AIDS and hepatitis at the end of last year and was
conducting experiments on nearly 500 monkeys, chimpanzees,
woodchucks and other animals. PETA has long complained that Sema
has one of the highest mortality rates for its animals in the
country, but the company denies that allegation.

ANIMAL RIGHTS: STARDUST HEADLINER BOBBY BEROSINI IS SUING AFTER TAPES SHOWED 
HIM HITTING HIS ORANGUTANS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With performing orangutans, chorus line dancers and a few laughs, this show has 
the makings of a hit on the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe a TV soap opera, given 
the accusations of abuse, tearful denials and tales of intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
But the stage for this show is the Clark County courthouse, a few miles off the 
famed Strip. A proceeding known here as "The Monkey Trial" has tantalized Las 
Vegas for four weeks with an inside look at the backstage politics of floor 
shows on the Strip and what some say is a raw display of special treatment for 
stars here. 
</P>
<P>
When its run ends, the trial's most sweeping result could be to force animal 
protection activists around the country to scale back their aggressive tactics 
in pursuit of suspected animal abusers. 
</P>
<P>
"If they make this stick, no Humane Society or ASPCA (American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) can ever investigate a report of animal 
abuse," said Philip Hirschkop, a Virginia attorney for People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals, (PETA) a Washington-based group. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, a video camera hidden backstage at the Stardust hotel-casino 
recorded headliner Bobby Berosini hitting his orangutans across the back with a 
rod while handlers held the apes' hands. The treatment is repeated on tape 
several nights, moments before Berosini and his apes take the stage for their 
act of gags and tricks during the Lido de Paris floor show. 
</P>
<P>
An animal rights organization got hold of the tape and sent copies to primate 
experts around the world. Most, including famed researcher Jane Goodall, 
complained that it depicted gross abuse. The tape and the charges found their 
way onto national television, first on "Entertainment Tonight," then on the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Berosini, who contends that he was only "correcting" his reddish-brown, 
waist-high apes, is suing for slander and invasion of privacy, and seeking $80 
million in damages. This is no ordinary lawsuit, however, even by Las Vegas 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The jury has been sequestered each night in the Golden Nugget hotel-casino 
across the street -- a highly unusual step for a non-criminal proceeding. But 
then, most civil lawsuits take years to come to trial here. This one got to 
court in 11 months. The trial also convenes evenings and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Pitaro, Berosini's lead attorney, only smiles and shrugs when asked how 
the trial came to be expedited. But in Las Vegas, Berosini is a star. His name 
in lights towers over the Strip outside the Stardust. Since 1984, the 
performing orangutans have been a twice-a-night mainstay of the Lido de Paris, 
a spectacle of chorus numbers and topless dancers that the Stardust advertises 
as "The Show That Made Las Vegas Famous." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants -- PETA, local activists and ex-Stardust dancers -- have a more 
conspiratorial view. They say that Las Vegas has closed ranks around Berosini 
to protect abusive animal acts in the Strip's hotel-casinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada's a very political state, more than any I've ever litigated in," 
Hirschkop said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have sought a mistrial more than 20 times, claiming numerous 
mistakes and favoritism toward Berosini by the judge -- beginning with the 
trial's opening act. When the jury was first seated, Berosini was allowed to 
bring in the orangutans and give a short performance. Jurors were enraptured by 
the mugging apes with the big eyes, outraged defense lawyers said, making it 
hard for them to objectively view testimony that Berosini mistreats the 
orangutans. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, Myron Leavitt, was Nevada's lieutenant governor from 1979-82. The 
defense sought to have Leavitt disqualified because he is a former roommate and 
law partner of William Boyd, one of the Stardust owners, and received a $25,000 
campaign contribution from the Stardust for an unsuccessful try for election to 
the Nevada Supreme Court. Leavitt ruled there was no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was totally improper for the judge to not disqualify himself," 
Hirschkop said in an interview. "I feel he has shown bias." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after Leavitt ruled that more than 15 defense witnesses -- including 
key experts on animal abuse -- would not be allowed to testify for procedural 
reasons, activists who are observing the trial reacted bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia is a pretty open society now. Why can't Las Vegas be?" said Cleveland 
Amory, animal rights activist and president of the New York-based Fund for 
Animals. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has been played out before local TV news cameras and, on especially 
good days, a courtroom full of spectators. They have heard Berosini labeled 
"worse than a child abuser," and Hirschkop called a communist by the 
entertainer. One defendant, a local animal rights activist, also complained 
that one of Berosini's attorneys was having a relationship with her sister. 
More than once the judge has threatened fines for courtroom behavior. 
</P>
<P>
For the four days that Berosini testified, the courtroom was treated to 
laughter and copious tears. A native of Czechoslovakia whose father and son 
also have performed in Las Vegas, Berosini said he has lost a TV show and other 
work in the entertainment field because no one wants to touch him -- though his 
show continues at the Stardust. 
</P>
<P>
When the tape became public, the Stardust received more than 1,000 out-of-state 
phone calls of protest. "I was in shock, sir. I was in bad shape," Berosini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The orangutans are not abused, he declared. "The animals are not beaten," 
Berosini testified. "I corrected those animals." 
</P>
<P>
He blames the trouble on disgruntled dancers who are unhappy that he has the 
power to have dancers fired at the Stardust, and on zealots who want the power 
to keep animals out of Las Vegas shows. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about animals," Joan Berosini, his wife and former stage partner, 
said outside court one afternoon. "It's about power. They don't even like 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
PETA said its investigators found that the orangutans cower in terror in 
Berosini's presence and often urinate at the sight of him. A veterinarian found 
physical evidence of abuse. The apes are kept isolated in dark, metal boxes -- 
rather than outside in cages or wooded compounds, as in zoos -- to intensify 
their emotional reliance on Berosini, the group contends. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Berosini lost his federal permit to breed and obtain new 
orangutans, in part because of the living conditions on the bus where he keeps 
the orangutans. Laws require cages of 22 square feet per animal, and he 
provides about 7 1/2 feet. The government also cited Berosini's failure to 
breed the Sumatran apes, a requirement of the permit allowing him to keep an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Berosini, in turn, says the apes could not perform if they were abused, and in 
court he sparred with attorney Dan Foley over the need for more space. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't lay like people, Mr. Foley," Berosini said. "They have very short 
legs. They put their legs on their stomach and hold them with their hands. They 
are very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The apes watch television to relieve their boredom, Berosini said. He conceded 
that none of his orangutans have been bred, but he denied charges by activists 
that his breeding program is a sham to let him keep the animals. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Berosini said, he tried to match Tiga, his 24-year-old 
female, with Rusty, a 17-year-old male, but they weren't compatible. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, she used to beat him up," Berosini testified. "Tiga is a lovable 
animal, but for some reason she didn't like Rusty." 
</P>
<P>
When Foley pressed for details on the stage gags performed by the apes -- 
especially one in which they raise a single finger to the audience -- Berosini 
broke up the courtroom in laughter with his rejoinder: "Mr. Foley, I'll give 
you a demonstration of how to give the finger if you want." 
</P>
<P>
Berosini has been unable to clear up a key point of contention: What was the 
object he was using to hit the apes? Activists and dancers contend that it was 
a steel reinforcing bar. Berosini said it was a wooden baton that was lost 
before he could produce it as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
During the defense's case, which began last week and ended abruptly early this 
week, there was testimony about Berosini's jealousy when country singer Dottie 
West got his dressing room -- the one with the private bathroom -- and about 
dancers who lost their jobs for crossing Berosini. In one episode, Berosini's 
displeasure with new hats worn by the dancers ended in a fight and a battery 
charge against the entertainer, which has been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants put witnesses on the stand -- including actress Rue McClanahan, 
a PETA member, and music personality Casey Kasem -- to challenge the contention 
that Berosini has lost work. The main defense point is that activists cannot be 
held liable for making what they consider to be truthful charges. 
</P>
<P>
The hidden videotape was made by a former Lido de Paris dancer, Ottavio 
Gesmundo, who said he and other dancers suspected abuse of the orangutans but 
could never prove it. A condition of their job was that they stay away from the 
curtained-off area where Berosini prepares the animals. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, Gesmundo said, after he was informed that he was not to be 
rehired, he hid the camera where it could tape Berosini. Every night after the 
taping, while Berosini was on stage, the Lido dancers would gather in their 
dressing room to watch the tape. "We couldn't believe what we were seeing," 
dancer Russell Martin testified. 
</P>
<P>
Gesmundo sent copies to PETA, which quietly conducted an investigation, the 
group's officials said. The tape was released to "Entertainment Tonight" via 
another defendant, the California-based Performing Animal Welfare Society, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
PETA officials said that when they received the tape, they sent it to 20 
experts on primate behavior. Several responded with notarized letters 
condemning the treatment seen on the tape, PETA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodall wrote from England that she was "shocked, sickened -- and saddened" by 
what she described as entirely unprovoked assaults. 
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely believe that these orangs should be confiscated immediately and 
placed in the hands of caring and responsible people (and those responsible) 
should never be allowed to own, train or handle animals again," said Goodall, 
widely known for her pioneering work with chimpanzees in Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, an inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture testified 
that he found no signs of abuse on the animals. But he noted under 
cross-examination that he had no experience in evaluating orangutans.

   How can one dislike a book whose first chapter opens, "I
never really warmed to Clovis . . . but he always claimed a
corner of my heart, largely, I suppose, because of the way he
instinctively and unconsciously cupped his genitals whenever
he was alarmed or nervous."
   On the other hand, how can one not be wary of a novel that
takes Socrates' worn observation "The unexamined life is not
worth living" as both its epigraph and final sentence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   William Boyd writes with such charm, clarity and energy
that he overcomes whatever wariness he arouses, propelling
his story, almost unscathed, through thickets of symbolism
that would hopelessly snag a less-skilled novelist. Mr. Boyd
may not know exactly when a bag of tricks turns into excess
baggage, but "Brazzaville Beach" (Morrow, 316 pages, $21) is
a fast-moving, intricately plotted novel that further
demonstrates his great storytelling talent.
   In his first two novels, "A Good Man in Africa" and "An
Ice-Cream War," Mr. Boyd demonstrated an expert eye for the
follies of African politicians and the sad fruitlessness of
African wars. "Brazzaville Beach" is set against a
contemporary African civil war (most closely resembling
Angola's), but the conflict is subordinate to the story of a
young English scientist, Hope Clearwater, and two appalling
events that befall her -- the madness of her genius
mathematician husband and the descent into evil of the
chimpanzees she studies.
   The structure of "Brazzaville Beach" is dazzling. Mr.
Boyd's twin dramas unfold in alternating sections: Hope's
courtship and marriage told in the third person and her
African adventures in her own voice. Between the dramatic
sections, Mr. Boyd inserts bits of mathematical, zoological
and other lore. The potential for missteps is high, but Mr.
Boyd keeps his novel moving without a serious stumble. The
elan of his prose enlivens these brief accounts of the habits
of such phenomena as the wave albatross, lemmas and Fermat's
Last Theorem (its beauty lies in its unprovability).
   Even when he overloads his chimpanzee tales with symbolic
reference to the fall of man from the Garden of Eden, the
storytelling overcomes the potential for disaster.
"Brazzaville Beach" is probably the most serious novel
dealing with apes since "You Shall Know Them" by the French
writer Vercors in the 1950s. If apes are so like us, Vercors
asked, where do we draw the line on what is human and what is
ape? Mr. Boyd's question is: If chimpanzees share all but a
tiny percentage of our genetic makeup, do they share
humankind's evil? It is "Brazzaville Beach's" conceit that
Hope is the first human to witness chimpanzees murdering
their own kind, enjoying their victims' pain and eating their
dead enemies.
   Hope discovers what she calls the chimpanzee wars. She
watches in horror (just as famed chimpanzee-observer Jane
Goodall once did) as a large group hunts and destroys a
smaller group.
   Hope is a sometimes puzzling, but fascinating, heroine.
She is a woman of enormous determination who studies her
future husband from afar rather as she later watches
chimpanzees. She questions her behavior, wondering when she
has done the right thing as she recollects the events of her
life. Still young, certified by academic degrees, she finds
life on the remote beach not stultifying, but satisfying.
After the great passions she has witnessed, quiet is welcome.
   No passion in this novel is greater than her husband
John's ache for fame in mathematics.
   Hope, herself, watches the chimpanzee wars with growing
excitement, knowing that her name is likely to be associated
forever with this evil turn. But, this is not a novel in
which great expectations are rewarded; John's hopes are
crushed and Hope also has wounds to lick as she rests in her
shack by the sea. Fame can be stolen in many ways.
   "Brazzaville Beach" is highly entertaining, but darker
than Mr. Boyd's sparklingly witty first two African novels.
His wit surfaces most often here when he turns to the
cynicism and incompetence of the civil war being conducted
around the chimpanzee reserve. When Hope and a colleague are
seized, their young captors are wearing identical track-suit
tops reading: "Atomique Boum." Her colleague prods Hope to
find out what it means. "Relax," she says, returning with the
information. "We've been captured by a volleyball team."
   Hope's lover is a gentle Egyptian pilot who flies MiGs for
the government's air force. The guerrillas' guns aren't very
dangerous, he tells Hope. "Your ground crew is your greatest
enemy."
   Along with its futility, the war has its cruelties. One of
Mr. Boyd's most sympathetic characters is a doctor who leads
the boys of "Atomique Boum." He understands his country's
needs and, what's more, knows how to fight a guerrilla war.
But "Brazzaville Beach" is no kinder to political dreams than
it is to scholarly ones.
   In the end, the mood of "Brazzaville Beach" is not unlike
that of the film "Casablanca" and other great romances. It is
a survivor's tale. As Hope examines her life she knows that
her pilot lover made a wise choice of personal motto: "Never
be too happy."

   Former astronaut John Glenn and undersea
explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau are among 15 recipients of $10,000
cash and crystal globes awarded by the National Geographic Society
on its 100th anniversary.
   Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach the summit of Mount
Everest, and Robert D. Ballard, the Navy scientist who discovered
the sunken remains of the Titanic, also were among the pioneers
selected for society's ``Centennial Awards,'' which will be
presented Thursday.
   Other winners:
   _Bradford Washburn and Barbara Washburn for cartography and
mountaineering. The Washburns spent seven years creating a precise,
large-scale map of the Grand Canyon. Barbara Washburn was the first
women to reach the summit of Mount McKinley, North America's highest
peak.
   _Frank C. Craighead Jr. and John J. Craighead, biology and
ecology. The Craigheads were pioneers in the use of satellites for
radio tracking of animals and are known especially for their
research on grizzly bears.
   _Harold E. Edgerton, who developed the method of using strobe
lights to freeze action in pictures, allowing for the photography of
hummingbirds and other extraordinarily fast creatures and objects.
He also pioneered the underwater camera and side-scan sonar for
ocean research.
   _Thayer Soule, lecturer. Soule has shared his knowledge of the
world and its peoples with film and lectures since 1947.
   _Mary D. Leakey and Richard E. Leakey, for their research into
the beginnings of mankind. The Leakeys, from a first breakthrough in
1959, have made a series of discoveries of bones of ancestors of
modern humans.
   _George F. Bass, underwater archeologist, for his work in
increasing the understanding of the ancient world through
exploration of shipwrecks.
   _Jane Goodall, for her pioneering research of chimpanzees in
Tanzania, the longest continuous field research ever conducted on a
wild animal.
   _Kenan D. Ballard for a lifetime of work unearthing and restoring
the ancient classical Greek city of Aphrodisias, in present Turkey.
   Glenn, now a Democratic senator from Ohio, was the first American
to orbit the earth. Hillary was honored both for his famed climb of
Everest and his subsequent work in creating schools, hospitals and a
national park in the region.
   ``One mark of great individuals is their ability to look byond
areas of expertise to see the larger picture _ to understand the
problems facing us all and to do something about them,'' said the
society's president, Gilbert M. Grosvenor.

   Cave, a former professor of philosophy, exempts American Indians
and Eskimos, whose survival is dependent on the hunting of game.
   The movement is marked by a hyperbolic rhetoric reminiscent of
the '60s. Some activists call themselves freedom fighters for
animals. Newkirk is happy to reiterate a statement some others wish
she had never said in the first place.
   ``I can't even remember it exactly,'' says British-born Newkirk,
``but I stand by it l00 percent. What I said was a pig is a boy is a
dog is a rat in that they are all sentient beings, they are all
capable of suffering. That is indisputable.''
   The various groups are not above squabbling, especially over
funding.
   Cave says the Humane Society of the United States, which has an
annual budget of $9 million, ``has a stranglehold on the funds that
is totally unethical. Its president, John Hoyt, is paid $139,000 a
year. The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has a fortune sitting idle in investments. They could wipe
out the pet overpopulation in one year if they would use some of
that money.''
   The MSPCA, founded in 1839, has an endowment of $42 million and
spent $15 million last year supporting three veterinarian hospitals,
nine shelters and various educational projects.
   The Humane Society doesn't support some of the statements of the
radicals, and deplores the violence.
   ``We like to be taken seriously when we go to the Hill,'' says a
Humane Society spokeswoman. ``We don't like to be seen as frothing
at the mouth.''
   Cave, who lives on a $10,000 salary, part of his group's total
budget of $350,000, led the Cornell campaign. He calls it a landmark
in that the challenge was not about sloppy laboratory conditions,
but the very nature of the research.
   He maintained that barbituate addiction is a complex human
problem and that it was inappropriate to expose cats _ or any animal
_ to the horrors of withdrawal, a self-inflicted condition in humans.
   Cave is now attacking a glue-sniffing experiment using monkeys at
New York University Hospital. In nice weather, Trans-Species has 14
tables out every weekend on New York City streets explaining its
philosophy.
   The biomedical research community has reacted by forming a
Washington-based educational and lobbying group.
   ``We're not talking here about little old ladies in blue hair,''
says Frankie Trull, president of the Foundation for Biomedical
Research. ``We have heard of over 50 death threats. The research
community is so unprepared for the animal rights movement. First of
all, they have jobs and they don't have time to hang out at shopping
centers with signs.
   ``It is costing millions in increased security, replacing animals
that were stolen and buildings that were torched. It is no laughing
matter.''
   The research scientist at Cornell, Dr. Michiko Okamoto, refuses
to talk to reporters. Her colleagues say she was shocked by the
developments.
   Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, a cardiovascular surgeon who became a
household name, has emerged as one spokesman for the researchers.
Now 80, but working daily from 4 a.m. till midnight, DeBakey says he
occasionally gets death threats. He sees the animal rights movement
as one with great emotional appeal, but one that is not telling the
whole story.
   ``These people are intimidating a lot of people,'' DeBakey says.
``If you want to become a Jehovah's Witness and refuse blood from
another person, I have no argument. I don't agree with it, but I
respect your right to do it. What I object to here is the attempt to
enforce this view on others.
   ``I have yet to see a patient who refused treatment from research
gained from animals. Do these people plan on turning down such
treatment if they need it?''
   DeBakey says his surgical breakthroughs, which saved thousands of
lives, resulted from experimentation on dogs.
   ``Almost everything in the cardiovascular field was developed
through animal research. You can't use cells or cell cultures or
computers.''
   The surgeon says animal activists ``are not improving the
conditions of animals used in research, They are pricing it out of
the market. Twelve states have now passed laws prohibiting the use
of pound animals. Yet the taxpayer spends $600 million a year caring
for pound animals and putting them to sleep.
   ``The activists have great political strength and slick
organizations. They say alternative methods can be used. They are
wrong.''
   DeBakey worries about the Cornell decision.
   ``It is disturbing to see an institution of higher learning cave
in,'' DeBakey says. ``The integrity of that academic institution is
eroded.''
   Medical scientists point to the great strides made using animal
models. Everything from polio vaccine to treatments for such
diseases as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease have benefited from
research on animals.
   The activists insist the same advances could have been made using
different kinds of research.
   Dr. Frederick King, director of the Yerkes Primate Center at
Emory University in Atlanta, also a target of death threats, is
eager to speak out. Researchers at his institution are injecting
chimpanzees with the deadly AIDS virus (So far it has not jumped
their immune barrier, but King says that does not mean it will not
with a longer incubation).
   The animals rights militants say that is not necessary since
there are thousands of dying human victims who would gladly allow
themselves to be experimented upon.
   ``Forget the ethical questions,'' Newkirk says. ``It's bad
science. They are retarding the AIDS research by using animals.''
   King dismisses that argument. He says it's yet another case of
non-scientists throwing in their non-scientific opinion.
   ``My question is where have all the moderates gone?'' King says.
``Even Jane Goodall, who came here about a year ago, has turned to
their side. She's a one-agenda person, fanatically attached to
chimps.
   ``The moderates all seem to have gone into the woodwork.''

<TEXT>     In 1985, Congress refined the Animal Welfare Act with the aim of improving
conditions for the thousands of laboratory animals now used in the United
States for experimentation and research. I sponsored an amendment to that law
calling for changes in the care of primates -- chimpanzees, baboons, rhesus
and other monkeys -- to enhance their "psychological well-being.";   Personal
outrage; I insisted on the amendment after visiting a research facility of the
National Institutes of Health near Washington. To my shock and dismay, I found
that the primates were confined in individual cages about the size of a small
shower stall.;   These well-built steel structures were to be the "homes" of
individual animals for several years. I also learned that only a few
facilities routinely provided even limited exercise for the animals out of the
cages.;   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has now promulgated regulations
to enforce the law, but unfortunately it has failed on two important issues:
primate cage size and the exercise of dogs.;   The same cages; The new USDA
regulations specify exactly the same cage sizes for primates that weigh as
much as 105 pounds: Envision a small cell 3 1/2 feet wide and 8 feet long with
a 7-foot ceiling and you have the picture. The smaller 3-foot cages are deemed
suitable for primates weighing as much as 55 pounds.;   One of the regulations
requires provision for "normal postural adjustment" by the animals.
Apparently, NIH and USDA believe "normal" adjustments are met as long as the
baboon confined in one of the 3-foot cubes can stand on all four feet, turn
around and sit down. But what about standing upright, lying down stretched out
or stretching their arms? And in some research institutions animals live in
their cages for years and are only occasionally let out.;   Is it humane for
these animals to be so confined?;   Also unkind to dogs; Congressional intent
on exercise for dogs also is not met in the new regulations. The new
regulations require only that individually caged dogs be released. This
excludes dogs that are confined two at a time in a double cage system or in
other groupings. USDA officials offer as a rationale for this that dogs in
double cages can exercise all the time and thus need not be released.;   The
USDA veterinarians add that since another regulation provides for daily
cleaning of the cages, such as in the case of a double-size cage with two
beagles, the only feasible method would be to remove the beagles to clean the
cage. In other words, while the dogs are out of the cage they can exercise as
they wish.;   Good for research, too; There is an axiom that the best medical
research is performed on normal, healthy animals and that some research
results may be questionable when abnormal animals are used. Indeed, the
"psychological well-being" amendment has resulted in improvements and
innovations at a significant number of research facilities.;   Keeping a
primate alone in a small cage for years degrades psychological well-being,
according to many primatologists, including Jane Goodall.;   There is a
lawsuit in federal court to address the inadequacies of the regulations. As a
former legislator, I would be disappointed if the issue could not be settled
without leaving it for a court decision.;   University research institutions
tend to brush off criticism from animal-rights activists as an effort to limit
medical research. Yet there is plenty of room for improving the care of
animals while advancing research. These dual causes do, in fact, complement
each other.  </TEXT>

   A Virginia Tech cadet was abducted by a
group of masked students who shaved his head in an attack that
apparently was sparked by an ice-throwing incident at a football
game, school officials said Tuesday.
   ``I think it's some overzealous behavior on the part of some
students who acted with malice,'' said Thomas Goodale, vice
president for student affairs. One of the eight to 10 students
accused of abducting and injuring Steve Woodberry, 19, of
Nokesville, has been arrested. More arrests are expected, Goodale
said.
   Woodberry was listed in stable condition with a bruised brain at
Roanoke Memorial Hospital.
   Jennings Cole II, 19, of Front Royal, faces charges of abduction,
hazing and malicious wounding, school officials said. All the
students involved are believed to be members of the Corps of Cadets
Highty Tighty band, but the university does not hold the corps
responsible, Goodale said.
   Goodale said he did not consider the incident to have been
hazing, but rather ``a personal matter between students.''
   Goodale said the attack occurred in the early morning hours
Thursday when the students wearing ski masks knocked on Woodberry's
door, abducted him and took him to a campus duck pond where they
shaved his head with an electric razor. The episode appeared to have
been thoroughly plotted, with some students standing guard, Goodale
said.
   The attack was broken up when Virginia Tech police on a routine
patrol came along, he said. One of the students' ski masks was
removed, leading to Cole's arrest Monday, he said.
   Woodberry was initially treated on campus and released Friday. He
participated in a field exercise that day but was taken to
Montgomery Regional Hospital on Sunday when other students became
concerned about a bad headache he had.
   The attack apparently was prompted by an ice-throwing incident at
the Virginia Tech-West Virginia football game on Oct. 1, Goodale
said.
   Woodberry has since left the band.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To Cynthia Moss, who spent years in the wilds of
Africa, elephants are special, endearing animals. In her book,
``Elephant Memories,'' she tells why, describing the close familial
relationships and bonding among elephants. ``I want people to know
that so they care enough to save them,' she says.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Cynthia Moss, native of Ossining, N.Y.,
philosophy major at Smith College and magazine researcher-reporter
for four years, took a five-week vacation when she was 27 to visit
a friend in Africa.
   ``I went to see one of the last wilderness areas, but I ended up
falling in love with the country,'' she says.
   And later with elephants.
   So much so that without any scientific training, she has become
an authority on the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenya
and has published an account based on 13 years of observing the
population and its behavior through periods of drought and
scarcity, plentiful rain and overabundance. She watched as
poachers, Masai warriors, injury, disease and tourists interfered.
Some survived. Some did not.
   Her book, ``Elephant Memories,'' tells much about the intricate
bonding among elephants and the elaborate kinship throughout their
lives.
   It's a story of a matriarchal society with rings and rings of
relationships, from the most intense, the mother and her newborn
calf, to the mother and her other immature offspring, through
family units, bond groups and clans.
   Moss was able to observe the canniness of the older matriarchs
in times of drought. Confirming the powers of elephants' memories,
they remembered from previous droughts where vegetation was most
likely to survive and so they managed. In tough times, she found,
elephants break up into smaller groups to forage more effectively.
   She saw that family members will risk danger, charging the
poachers to protect their own, while more distant clan members will
run.
   ``The book is not just about numbers,'' says Moss, director of
elephant research in the park. ``I want people to realize how
special elephants are. How funny, how endearing they can be. I want
people to know that so they care enough to save them.''
   She writes of the elephantine joy as they greet each other after
a separation, or as young males gleefully play-fight with each
other. She writes about elephant grief as the mother of a dead calf
tries to force grass into her mouth to bring it back to life and
tries over and over to hoist it to its feet.
   She writes with wonder about what is going on in their brains as
they come upon the bones of an elephant and minutely inspect them,
throwing them in the air, perhaps to decipher the correct obituary.
   One prestigious critic, who liked the book, accused her of
anthropomorphizing the behemoths.
   ``That's a rather out-of-date thing to say,'' retorts Moss. ``A
scientist would not make that accusation. That is all part of field
work.''
   Moss considers herself lucky for getting a head start in her
field work by being offered a research assistant's job by Iain
Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneer in using extensive photography so that
he could eventually recognize over 500 individual elephants in a
study in Tanzania. Moss worked with him for several years before
embarking on her own.
   ``Today, it would be almost impossible to do it the way I did
it,'' she says. ``For someone with no field experience to get a
paying job would be almost impossible.''
   She estimates that her research, paid for mainly by the African
Wildlife Foundation, the Merlin Foundation and the New York
Zoological Society, probably cost $100,000 for her nearly 20 years
in the wild.
   Moss did not live all alone for long periods, such as Jane
Goodall did initially in her studies of chimpanzees, or the late
Diane Fossey in her gorilla work. Other researchers were nearby.

   ``We hope that if we can figure out what the devil provides that
protection, we can contract a vaccine that provides protection,''
Gordon says.
   Around the corner from the mangabeys is a family of pygmy
chimpanzees, part of an ambitious breeding program. The animals
sometimes don't breed easily in captivity, and Yerkes researchers
are proud of their eight pygmy births.
   Across the grounds is a group of full-size chimpanzees, being
watched in a food-and-behavior study and also part of the National
Institutes of Health's five-institution National Chimpanzee Breeding
and Research Program. Researchers figure the animals, so closely
related to man, may be needed someday for AIDS research.
   In the laboratories at the main Yerkes station in Atlanta,
scientists are studying various primates in efforts to combat
Parkinson's disease, eye disorders and even tooth decay.
   The Parkinson's research, King says, is one of the center's
crowning achievements since he arrived as director in 1978. Yerkes
scientists were the first to demonstrate the feasibility of
implanting fetal brain tissue that produces dopamine _ a compound
which acts as a transmitter in the nervous system _ into the brain
of Parkinson's patients as a treatment for the debilitating nerve
disease. Now, doctors in several countries are trying the same
technique in humans.
   ``I consider this one of our major advancements,'' King says.
``We were the first. It's a big step in the right direction.''
   Other achievements at Yerkes in the past 10 years:
   _An anti-inflammatory drug, effective in rhesus monkeys in
stopping the progression of periodontal disease, is now being tested
in human patients at Emory's dental school.
   _Yerkes scientists and Emory ophthalmologists, using primates,
are studying methods of post-surgery treatment for children born
with cataracts. Their work has shown that a traditional technique of
patching the normal eye, forcing the child to use the operated-upon
eye, may be detrimental.
   _Researchers using monkeys, chimps and human volunteers have
found structural and chemical changes in cervical secretions during
the menstrual cycle, which could someday lead to new methods of
birth control or promoting fertility.
   _Language studies in chimpanzees yielded a language system _ with
visual symbols, a computer-operated keyboard and step-by-step
teaching strategies _ that is now being used by cooperating Georgia
State University experts to teach severely retarded children to
communicate. The work was spearheaded by two psychologists from
Yerkes and Georgia State University, Dr. Duane Rumbaugh and his
wife, Dr. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh.
   ``The work of the Rumbaughs must stand very high in the
achievements of this center,'' King says.
   King, a neuroscientist and psychologist, enjoys explaining that
the Rumbaughs were not, at first, looking for a way to help retarded
kids; they were looking at apes.
   ``That began as an attempt to explore some fundamental questions
about the use and capability of great apes to use symbols,'' he
says. ``The important thing is that it started out as a fundamental
scientific project, with nothing in sight in terms of application.''
   He compares the accomplishment to Alexander Fleming's accidental
discovery of penicillin's properties during routine mold studies.
   ``It is that kind of science that has brought us out of medieval
fear and superstition into enlightenment and our ability to deal
more effectively with the world around us,'' King saysd.
   King acknowledges that animals die at Yerkes, but he maintains
they die in the pursuit of what researchers believe is a greater
good. Most people, King says, believe that way, too.
   ``I believe in the sanity of the people of this country,'' he
says. ``This is a utilitarian nation. That utilitarian sense, and
the recognition of what animal contributions have been _ and the
recognition that scientists are not ogres, but care for living
beings other than humans _ I think will lead the nation to recognize
eventually the benefits of science.
   ``This nation will support, and continue to support, life
sciences in general and medical and behavioral sciences in specific,
with primates or whatever other species. I have that confidence.''
   King bristles when asked whether, in retrospect, some experiments
have proven to be unnecessary killing of animals.
   ``Do we have experiments that fail? Of course we do,'' he says.
``It's part of science.
   ``If we knew what was going to happen for sure, we wouldn't do
the experiment! Nobody wants to do stupid, meaningless work.''
   King's stresses in his lectures that animal researchers are not
extremists. The extremists, he insists, are those who would
needlessly butcher and torture animals _ or those who would ban any
scientific use of animals at all.
   ``In all sincerity,'' he says, ``scientists occupy the middle
road of compassion and humane treatment...I don't know any scientist
or institution that doesn't want to reduce that discomfort or pain
to a minimum, but at the same time recognizes that human priorities,
with regard to using animals in research, must come first.''
   King envisions a day when he and Yerkes can put the debate behind
them and get on with their work, and his goals go beyond behavioral
and medical research.
   Without prodding, a discussion of Yerkes quickly turns to King's
two passions: the endangered South American rain forests _ ``without
those, neither the primates nor other species will survive long'' _
and global population control, as man's increasing presence taxes
his planet's resources.
   ``I would like to see us move into the area of population
concerns,'' he says, conceding that for a traditional primate
research center, such work poses ``a difficult question.''
   ```Primate center' doesn't just mean monkeys and apes,'' he said.
``It means humans, too.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ An Atlanta research center has made significant
contributions to the treatment of disease over the years. But those
breakthroughs have come though experimentation with monkeys and

stage protest demonstrations at the center. The director of the
center has received death threats and other staff members say they

   Tucked into a wooded corner of Emory University's
suburban campus, the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center has
long exuded an air of mystery.
   Security fences and ``Private Property'' signs greet those who
find their way down a winding two-lane road behind Emory dorms and
offices, through the woods, past a secluded lake.
   Here for years white-coated scientists have labored quietly to
find, through study and experimentation with monkeys and apes,
answers to health problems that plague humans.
   But now there's an us-against-them feeling at Yerkes. The
researchers' pride in their accomplishments is tempered by
frustration, anger and even fear. A growing band of crusaders would
like nothing more than to shut the center down.
   ``I wasn't hired to do this, you know,'' grumbles Dr. Frederick
A. King Jr., having to explain to yet another reporter the steps
Yerkes takes to conduct its research as humanely as possible.
   King, an outspoken advocate of animal research and the director
of Yerkes for a decade, has been the target of death threats. His
center, an arm of Emory University and one of seven regional primate
research centers sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, has
been the site of numerous protests by animal rights activists.
   Last December, 12 people were arrested on the Emory campus in a
demonstration against the use of animals in scientific research, the
second such protest in a month. Three of those arrested lowered
themselves on ropes down the front of a six-story building and
unfurled a huge banner reading ``Save the Yerkes Chimps.'' The other
nine tried to block the university's main gate. Members of the
California-based group In Defense of Animals said the protest marked
the beginning of a two-year campaign against centers like Yerkes.
   Elsewhere in the nation, buildings have been burned and animal
rights activists have been arrested with bombs. Yerkes staffers say
they sometimes wonder about their personal safety.
   King says he has ``good reason to believe'' that virtually every
institution like his has been infiltrated by animal-rights activists.
   But his chief worry, King says, is that the animal rights
movement could diminish the effectiveness of the center, a place
where new techniques for treating Parkinson's disease were found,
where ape communication studies led to new ways of teaching retarded
children.
   ``What I am afraid of,'' he says, ``is that these people may get
bills passed in Congress, regulations passed through federal
agencies, that could be terribly, terribly injurious to research,
terribly restrictive and costly beyond belief.
   ``That's my fear, that they will whittle us down _ not that they
will knock us out of the box. By their acts of violence and
terrorism, breaking, entering, bomb threats, destroying property,
stealing animals, falsifying photographs of this and that, they cost
us a hell of a lot of money.''
   The center, named for its founder, Dr. Robert M. Yerkes, a
primate research pioneer, has three locations: the main station,
with labs and offices; a southeast Atlanta language lab, and the
field station, a spartan 117 acres in suburban Gwinnett County where
1,500 primates _ from 1,000 rhesus monkeys to a small family of
pygmy chimpanzees _ live in two dozen separately housed groups.
   Add to that 13 gorillas and a dozen orangutans at Zoo Atlanta
under an unusual and popular arrangement.
   The Zoo Atlanta project, in which primates roam in open-air
approximations of their original habitats, has spurred an ambitious
renovation plan that has brought the once-beleaguered zoo new-found
respect and thousands of new visitors.
   It's also good public relations for Yerkes, as it presents the
center's name to happy zoo visitors gazing at cuddly looking
creatures.
   It's also an ongoing research effort. Yerkes scientists continue
to study the behavior and reproduction of the gorillas and
orangutans at the zoo. In particular, Yerkes staffers and Atlantans
in general hope that Zoo Atlanta mainstay, Willie B., a gorilla who
spent nearly three decades in a cage, will settle down with a Yerkes
female in his new outdoor playground and have little Willies.
   But most of the Yerkes animals are at the field station, a large
site once out in the country, but now rapidly being surrounded by
subdivisions.
   It is there, amid heated concrete shelters and fenced-in pens,
that some 30 research scientists and animal care technicians work
with sooty mangabeys, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and that staple of
research labs, rhesus monkeys.
   On a recent winter's day, field station coordinator and research
professor Tom Gordon, strolled up to a gymnasium-size pen housing
hundreds of rhesus monkeys and started calling them by name.
   ``You get to know them after a while,'' he says.
   Yerkes scientists continually observe the monkeys, looking for
new behavioral characteristics. Even in the largest colonies, one
monkey is king, and a social hierarchy flows downward from him, his
mate and her offspring, with other families acting subservient.
   While some of the rhesus colony are taken from time to time for
lab experiments at the main station, others live on at the field
station for generations in an ongoing behavioral study.
   Another primate group getting a great deal of attention at the
field station these days is a collection of sooty mangabeys who, as
it turns out, are almost universally infected with SIV _ simian
immunodeficiency virus, a close cousin of HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, the killer virus that causes AIDS.
   Most primates infected with SIV will become ill, as do humans
infected with HIV. But for some reason, the sooty mangabeys, for the
most part, never become clinically ill.

<HEAD>Sir Reginald Goodall, Leading Wagnerian Conductor, is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Reginald Goodall, a leading conductor of the
works of Richard Wagner, has died. He was 88.
   His death was announced from a nursing home at Bridge near
Canterbury, where he died on Saturday. The cause of death was not
disclosed.
   Despite his reputation as an interpreter of Wagner, Goodall was
never principal conductor of a leading orchestra or opera company.
   During his career, he worked with the opera companies at Covent
Garden, Glyndebourne, Sadler's Wells and the English and Welsh
national companies.
   He also worked abroad as an assistant to some of the century's
greatest conductors, including Wilhelm Furtwangler, Otto Klemperer,
Clemens Krauss and Hans Knappertsbusch. He coached some of
Britain's finest Wagnerian singers _ Gwyneth Jones, Donald McIntyre
and David Ward.
   Goodall was reclusive _ his Who's Who entry occupied only four
lines _ and after a performance he would leave the podium quickly
for the musicians and singers to receive applause without him.
   He rarely used a baton, preferring to conduct with half-clenched
fists.
   British critics called him the greatest living Wagnerian in
1979, when his performances of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' with
the Welsh National Opera Company were sold out.
   He was then a frail widower living alone in the Kent
countryside. He was knighted in 1985 for services to music.
   Members of the Wagner family visited Britain to hear Goodall
conduct and called him the greatest conductor of the master's music.
   He was born in the cathedral city of Lincoln, and he studied at
the Royal College of Music and then in Munich and Vienna. He was an
organist, double-bass player and choirmaster.
   In 1945, Goodall conducted the Sadler's Wells premiere of
Benjamin Britten's opera ``Peter Grimes'' but for 20 years he rose
no higher than conductor's assistant for opera companies.
   Rodney Milnes, the country's leading opera critic, wrote: ``It
says a lot about England that this towering genius should have been
on the music staff at Covent Garden for two decades and more,
serving under notably inferior musical directors and being given
virtually nothing to do. All the conductors with whom he is to be
compared are dead.''
   Critics said Goodall's high ideals, long and detailed
preparation of an opera, individual coaching of all the singers and
all the instrumental rehearsals, were too demanding for opera
houses in his own country.
   Goodall gave his last performance at the 1987 Promenade Concerts
in London, where he conducted act three of Wagner's ``Parsifal.''
   His funeral will be in Canterbury on May 14. There was no word
on any survivors.

<HEAD>Yerkes Establishes Sperm Bank For Chimpanzees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first sperm bank for chimpanzees is
designed to meet the increasing demand for animals by AIDS
researchers, the bank's founder says.
   Chimpanzees are highly valued in research because they are the
closest biologically to humans. But they are a threatened species
that can no longer be captured legally in the wild.
   Dr. Kenneth G. Gould, chief of reproductive biology at the
Yerkes Regional Primate Center, said researchers there and at other
centers around the world infect the animals with AIDS to study the
progress of the disease in an animal with an immune system similar
to man's.
   Unlike man, the animals do not die of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, but they can spread the virus and therefore are not
allowed to breed after being infected.
   ``I'm glad to hear about his success,'' said Dr. Duane C.
Kraemer, a specialist in primate reproduction and a Texas A&amp;M
University professor. ``It's important that we develop techniques
for sperm storage and artificial insemination for a number of
species.''
   The bank will help breeders maintain a genetically diverse
population of captive chimps and give scientists a model for
developing sperm banks for other primates such as gorillas.
   For more than three decades, scientists have frozen human and
cattle sperm successfully, but the same formulas did not prevent
ice crystals from destroying the chimpanzee sperm until Gould's
success.
   Gould began freezing the chimpanzee sperm in 1986, and
eventually found that it had to be frozen more slowly than that of
other species.

   A biomedical foundation is establishing a
pension plan for 81 AIDS-infected chimpanzees.
   The Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research plans to invest
more than $1.77 million over the next 10 years into chimpanzee
retirement accounts that are expected to grow into $2.9 million
through the year 2026, officials said.
   ``We always have had a moral obligation to take care of the
animals that we use, but we can have the best intentions in the
world, but if we don't have the money, there is little that we can
do for them,'' John Speck, controller of the biomedical foundation.
   The fund will help in their care and is sure to be enough to buy
bunches of bananas and lots of apples, cucumbers, celery and
watermelon over the next 40 years for the chimpanzees, who cannot be
used for other research after being exposed to AIDS.
   But Roger Fouts, a psychology professor at Central Washington
University in Ellensberg who has studied chimpanzees for 20 years,
said the biomedical foundation's humanitarian attempt is admirable,
but it might not be enough.
   ``If you look at $3 million for about 40 years, that's bare
minimum,'' he said. ``Giving a chimp enough food, enough water and
making sure that they have a dry and warm cage doesn't seem to be
enough.''
   Foundation officials said the chimps exposed to the AIDS virus
have shown no signs they have developed the fatal disease. It is
probable the chimps will live their normal life span of about 40
years or more, pushing their care bill to $5,000 each annually, they
said.
   The biomedical foundation is among the leading facilities
worldwide that conducts AIDS research using primates.
   Speck and Dr. Jorg Eichberg, director of veterinary resources,
began discussing two years ago how to pay for care for the chimps,
and started the investment program in the spring.
   Eichberg, who in June 1983 became the first scientist to infect a
chimpanzee with the AIDS virus, said he hopes the chimp retirement
program would silence animals rights groups critical of the
foundation's use of animals for experiments.
   ``We are really genuinely concerned that these animals get the
best treatment available,'' Eichberg says. ``We have to combine our
emotions with pragmatism in our work and I think we have done a
pretty good job.''
   But Fouts said research groups should do more for the chimpanzees.
   ``They must ensure that they lead as much as possible a normal
life,'' he said. ``What we have with chimpanzees is a species that
has been exploited by biomedical concerns, but this attempt by the
Southwest foundation to help the chimpanzees is an admirable one.''

   A recently isolated chimpanzee virus is more
closely related to the human AIDS virus than other AIDS-related
monkey viruses are, and may be a ``missing link'' between human and
primate versions, scientists say.
   However, the finding does not resolve the question of whether
the AIDS virus originated in humans or in animals, scientists said.
   Analysis of the chimpanzee virus is presented in Thursday's
issue of the British journal Nature by scientists from Gabon and
from the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
   The virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in the West
African nation and isolated from one of them. It is classified as a
lentivirus, the same category that includes HIV-1, which causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the United States.
   Other lentiviruses, called simian immunodeficiency viruses or
SIVs, have been found in four kinds of monkeys: macaques, sooty
mangabeys, African green monkeys and mandrills.
   Analysis of the new virus showed it was the first non-human
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as HIV-1,
the researchers reported. And when the protein products of its
genes were studied, they were more like those of HIV-1 than those
of the simian viruses tested.
   Nonetheless, when compared to the range of known genetic
variants of HIV-1, the chimp virus lay outside that range, the
researchers said.
   They suggested it might be called chimpanzee immunodeficiency
virus.
   Only two of 83 chimps tested in Gabon carried the virus,
indicating it is not widespread there, they reported. And none of
more than 250 chimpanzees caught over the last 15 to 20 years in
West Africa showed evidence of the virus.
   The two chimps in which the virus was found were both infants in
relatively good health. If the virus had made them ill with
anything like AIDS, they probably would not have survived predators
in the jungle, researchers said.
   It is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a
precursor to HIV-1, and even if it were, analysis indicates that it
could not be the immediate precursor, they said.
   But the virus may be a form of ``missing link'' between the
African Old World primate viruses and HIV-1, wrote Ronald
Desrosiers of the New England Regional Primate Research Center in
Southborough, Mass.
   He agreed that the discovery does not settle the question of
whether HIV-1 originated in humans or came from a non-human
ancestor. But further study of the isolate may shed light on it, he
said in a Nature editorial.

<TEXT>
Manweb, the Cheshire-based regional electricity company, has become the
latest power group to appoint a relative outsider to one of its two senior
posts. Bill Goodall, on the company's board for less than a year, is to take
over as non-executive chairman at the end of August.
He will succeed Bryan Weston who is retiring after 45 years in the industry.
Before privatisation four years ago, the way to the top in electricity was a
lifetime in the industry. Weston's appointment yesterday means that half of
the 12 regional electricity companies have chairmen who have spent the bulk
of their careers in other industries.
The Manweb appointment means Goodall, 62, now chairs four companies; the
others are Volex, electrical controls group, Hopkinsons, engineer, and
Inveresk, paper manufacturer.
Goodall began his career as a management trainee with Scapa Dryers in 1956
after graduating from Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Leeds University.
From there he rose to be chairman of Scapa Group, a post he relinquished
last October.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sigourney Weaver's African Adventure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sigourney Weaver has been known as a
courageous actress. But as the late naturalist Dian Fossey in
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' she has outdone herself.
   In earlier films she battled outer space demons (``Alien,''
``Aliens''), revolution (``The Year of Living Dangerously'') and
evil spirits (``Ghostbusters''). The new movie shows her in
conditions of genuine peril: working with silverback gorillas in
the mountain jungles of Rwanda without a double or net _ nothing
between her and a beast that could crush her in an instant.
   Fossey was murdered in Rwanda in her sleep. Her colleagues, who
considered her an eccentric, said she had angered local residents
with her aggressive efforts to restrict poaching.
   Weaver, 38, was born into the entertainment business. Her father
is Sylvester (Pat) Weaver, the NBC president considered to be the
architect of modern television. Her mother is the former actress
Elizabeth Inglis. After Stanford University and the Yale School of
Drama, she worked her way from off-Broadway to films.
   On a recent visit from her New York home, she talked about her
African experience in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Q. You don't pick easy pictures, do you?
   A. (laughing) That's probably true. My father says that if I
open a script and it takes place in Alaska with a lot of huskies
and I fall through the ice, I'll probably do it instead of a lovely
picture on the French Riviera.
   Q. Did you know about Dian Fossey and her work?
   A. I had gotten her book when it first came out. I had also been
at Stanford when they started that human-primate program where you
could live with an ape in your trailer and do your thesis on it.
Jane Goodall had come and spoken to us.
   After I read Dian's book (``Gorillas in the Mist'') I thought,
``They can't make a picture out of this; she is too difficult a
woman to be portrayed on the screen.'' I also thought logistically
it would be a nightmare. How could you possibly create the whole
atmosphere of the gorillas?
   Q. Were you involved in the joining of Universal and Warner
Bros. (which had competing projects)?
   A. No. I was approached by each studio separately. By the time
(producer) Arnie Glimcher approached me for Universal, I said,
``Arnie, I don't want to get involved with a picture that's not
going to happen.'' I thought they would knock each other out.
   Q. Once the deal was made, weren't you overwhelmed by the danger
involved?
   A. Not really. I was reading a lot of Dian's papers and
rereading her book, and it seemed that she was often threatened by
gorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It was all a question
of getting to know each other.
   I didn't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was a
lucky choice on my part. I don't think it would be wise go in and
to work with animals without having previously reassured yourself
that you would be all right.
   I was intimidated by trying to gather all the information about
Dian. So much of it was conflicting. And so much of it was hearsay.
She had a very negative reputation within her field, and she was
considered to be a very difficult woman. I heard people say some
pretty hard things about her. And some very loving things as well.
   Q. What kind of a person was she?
   A. She was a mass of opposites, I think. Everything you can say
about Dian, the opposite is probably true. She loved people, she
loved partying. ... On the other hand she shunned people, she
preferred to be with animals. She lived up in this isolated place,
tramping around in mud, yet she loved to go out in fancy clothes.
She always slept with curlers in her hair, even when she lived up
on top of the mountain.
   She is such an amazing collection of different things. I guess I
grew very fond of her. I was lucky to have access to her letters
and her camp notes through a colleague of hers. She really put
herself in those letters. I developed such an admiration for her
thoroughness, her commitment, her humor _ she was always making
jokes about herself. She had a wicked sense of humor, and I hope
that comes across in the film.
   Q. Did you train for the rigors of the location?
   A. In the press release, it says I ran up these volcanic
mountains in Hawaii. (laughing) I don't know where they got that. I
did walk up a hill behind my parents-in-law's house in Hawaii every
morning for about two weeks. I don't think any of us could have
gotten in shape for (the location). You had to get used to the
altitude and slowly get used to the climbs. It was difficult for
everyone except the Australians; they were very macho about the
whole thing.
   You were in such a beautiful part of the world and you were
perhaps going to see gorillas at the end of the climb or you were
going to the top of the mountain to shoot a scene.
   Q. What was your first encounter with the gorillas?
   A. We didn't think we were going to see gorillas that day. It
turned out they were only 5 minutes away from Dian's camp. We took
off through a beautiful forest filled with wild orchids. We heard a
great outburst of pock-pock sounds, which is the sound they make
beating their chests. I looked up and saw this big gorilla standing
halfway up the hill.
   You're so amazed to suddenly be in their territory; it was like
you had walked into another era. I just forgot, I was so entranced.
It was like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn. You forgot
your fear, you just went ahead.
   I went up to where they were all sitting around munching, though
I couldn't see them. This little gorilla came out to me and sat
down and touched my camera. She was very curious, taking me in in a
matter-of-fact way. She jumped away after she had visited, and I
was agog. It was an indescribable feeling.
   I just found out last week that that sweet little girl had been
caught in a poacher's trap ... and she didn't make it. There aren't
many females, and coming from a very good family, she would have
been a good mate.
   Q. Were you well-coached on how to behave with the gorillas?
   A. I kind of learned it as I went along. In the picture are a
couple of scary scenes where the silverback comes down right next
to me. They all happened the first times we went out. So I was kind
of thrown into the deep end.

   Dr. Melvin M. Payne, chairman emeritus of the
National Geographic Society's board of trustees, has died of
pneumonia, the society said Monday. He was 79.
   Payne, who began his career with the society in 1932 as a

died on Saturday.
   During his tenure as head of the society's research division, he
provided support for such projects as Capt. Jacques Cousteau's
underwater explorations, the first American ascent of Mt. Everest,
and Jane Goodall's study of wild chimpanzees.
   He also was instrumental in beginning the series of hour-long

   He was named president in 1967 and in 1976 was elected chairman
of the society's board of trustees. He has served as chairman
emeritus since 1987.
   Survivors include Payne's wife Ethel McDonnell Payne of
Bethesda, Md., two daughters, a brother, a sister, three
grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.

<HEAD>Research Center Creates Retirement Program for Chimps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retirement program for chimpanzees used in
hepatitis and AIDS research will house them in $63,000
air-conditioned bungalows, repayment for the apes' service to
humanity, a researchers says.
   ``We don't think of any of the animals as just tools of
research,'' said Dr. Jorg Eichberg, director of veterinary
resources at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.
``They've done so much for mankind, this is one way we can pay them
back.''
   A $2.9 million ``pension'' fund is being established at a San
Antonio bank with some of the chimps' ``earnings'' _ the research
grants and fees private and government research institutions pay to
use the animals, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday.
   A separate fund will pay for 12 air-conditioned retirement huts,
at a cost of $63,000 each, to house chimp retirees.
   Plans also are under way to build a playground for the chimps
similar to the $270,000 breeding colony now in use _ a large, airy
complex complete with swings, tires and grass.
   Huts inhabited by the animals during research have 19-inch color
televisions, but the retirees will have to do without, Eichberg
said.
   ``The retired chimps can visit with each other,'' he said.
``They don't get bored enough to watch TV.''
   The Journal of Medical Primatology has touted the plan as a
model for other research centers, the newspaper reported.
   The 192 chimps at the Southwest Foundation comprise one of the
world's largest captive colonies.
   Currently, 45 are used in research for vaccines against
hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. The rest are used in other private and government
medical research or for breeding.
   In 1983, Eichberg became the first scientist in the world to
infect a chimpanzee with HIV. That chimp, 15-year-old Paul, is now
in retirement at the foundation.
   Since the chimps can't be used for other research _ and since
chimps can live to age 50 _ Southwest Foundation researchers felt
the need to find some way to take care of them. Officials said they
expect the retirement colony eventually to include 80 chimps.
   The foundation spends about $1 million a year, or $17 a day per
chimp, to feed and maintain its animals, according to foundation
president Duncan Wimpress.

   Scentists today reported the discovery of what
may be the ``missing link'' between human and certain primate
versions of the AIDS virus.
   However, the finding does not resolve the question of whether
the AIDS virus originated in humans or in animals, the researchers
said.
   Genetic analysis of a recently found chimpanzee virus shows it
is more closely related to the human AIDS virus than it is to other
AIDS-related monkey viruses, scientists from Gabon and the Pasteur
Institute in Paris reported in the British journal nature.
   The virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in Gabon. It is
classified as a lentivirus, the same category that includes HIV-1,
which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the United
States.
   Other lentiviruses, called simian immunodeficiency viruses or
SIVs, have been found in four kinds of monkeys: macaques, sooty
mangabeys, African green monkeys and mandrills.
   Analysis of the new virus showed it was the first non-human
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as HIV-1,
the researchers reported. And when the protein products of its
genes were studied, they were more like those of HIV-1 than those
of the simian viruses tested.
   Nonetheless, when compared to the range of known genetic
variants of HIV-1, the chimp virus lay outside that range, the
researchers said. They suggested it might be called chimpanzee
immunodeficiency virus.
   It is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a
precursor to HIV-1, and even if it were, analysis indicates that it
could not be the immediate precursor, they said.
   Further study may shed light on whether the AIDS virus
originated in people or came from an animal virus, a primate
specialist observed in an accompanying editorial.
   The virus may be a form of ``missing link'' between the African
Old World primate viruses and the AIDS virus, wrote Ronald
Desrosiers of the New England Regional Primate Research Center in
Southborough, Mass.

REGGIE: THE LIFE OF REGINALD GOODALL by John Lucas Julia MacRae Books Pounds
18.99, 254 pages
REGINALD GOODALL, one of the leading British conductors of the century and
one of the elite among postwar Wagnerians, began his career with great (if
unevenly acknowledged) spurts of promise. He ended it, in advanced old age,
with a knighthood, magnificent recordings of The Ring (this month re-issued
on CD), Tristan and Parsifal to his credit, and the reverence of almost all
British Wagner-lovers.
In between, he endured a period of cruel neglect ' a staff conductor at the
Royal Opera House misunderstood, sidelined and eventually shelved, who for
ten years found his conducting dates there dwindled to non-existence
(between the 1961 Boris Godunov revival and the 1971 Parsifal).
Even during that time, of course, he was not reduced to total artistic
ineffectiveness. Otto Klemperer demanded his presence as assistant on those
late Klemperer recording sessions - the admiration between the two was
mutual, as it had been between Goodall and another leading conductor, Erich
Kleiber, and as it was to be between him and Kleiber's son Carlos. More to
the point, in his little eyrie at Covent Garden (nicknamed, naturally
enough, Valhalla) Goodall continued on the ewige Werk begun in the middle
1950s - the schooling of successive generations of British and Britain-based
Wagner singers to eloquence and international fame.
But then came the 1968 Sadler's Wells Opera Mastersingers - unforgettable in
the small theatre, repeated to even more splendid effect when the company
moved home to the Coliseum, where already the glorious adventure of the
English-language Ring was set to unfold.
Those performances, and the Welsh National Tristan and Valkyrie and ENO
Tristan and Parsifal of the late 1970s and '80s, amounted to a revelation of
long-lined, lovingly rehearsed, sagaciously sustained Wagner performance -
every instrumental line suffused with lyricism, every voice part unforced,
every word and note audible. These unforgettable evenings placed Goodall in
the grand line of Wagnerian conductors.
The Goodall 'galley years' at Covent Garden, as a chapter-title in John
Lucas's new biography aptly calls them, are therefore the more depressing to
contemplate when one holds them in the light of both the late triumphs and
the early career progress. In truth, little in his upbringing seemed likely
to promote that musical career; and the hand-to-mouth conditions, blinkered
British-is-best tastes and unwarranted self-satisfaction that obtained in
the musical life of this country for much of Goodall's early adulthood
seemed designed positively to frustrate it.
In spite of that, and of the combination of shyness, eccentricity, and
intransigence in search of high musical standards that marked his
personality, Goodall's achievements as choirmaster at St Alban's, Holborn,
and with the short-lived Wessex Philharmonic Orchestra forced him,
gradually, up the British musical ladder. The peak of thatearly period was
his conducting of the 1945 premiere of Peter Grimes: the Britten connection
led him in the postwar years to the newly formed opera company at Covent
Garden. But later that connection was broken (Britten took offence at some
small slight) and the gradual but inexorable decline in his fortunes as a
conductor set in.
This is a tale alternately saddening and exhilarating to read. Lucas -
husband of Anne Evans, Goodall devotee, a former Observer Arts Editor -
tells it excellently: even for those British opera-lovers who think they
know the ins and outs of it already, his Reggie will surely prove a
compelling and fascinating read.
The picture painted of Britten and his circle in the Grimes and early
Aldeburgh years is full of incident (some of it new to print), intrigue and
passions running high on all sides. Lucas does not shirk the snobbery,
prevarication and shady dealing that operated at Covent Garden in the
Webster-Drogheda era, nor the rough treatment Goodall underwent at the hands
of Solti on his arrival there in 1961 - had it not been for a handful of
obstinate Goodall champions, among them the critics Andrew Porter, David
Cairns and the late Peter Heyworth, and then the Sadler's Wells visionaries
Stephen Arlen and Edmund Tracey, Goodall's name would surely have been swept
off the Royal Opera masthead sooner or later.
But above all, this is the portrait of an extremely odd man, and it is
undertaken with commendable frankness. However much one regrets the many
chances missed, one comes to appreciate the number of obstacles placed by
Goodall himself in the way of his own steady progress. Foremost among these
must stand his pre-war fascist sympathies and his post-war reluctance to
accept the full extent of the horrors unleashed by his beloved Germany.
To his unbounded credit Lucas never shrinks from the issue. Neither does he
sensationalise it - and indeed, the admiration Goodall could feel for such
Jews as Klemperer does point to the self-contradiction and simple muddle
that Lucas discerns at the core of his political ideals. In sum, this is a
first-rate biography, painstakingly researched, judiciously balanced,
crisply and lucidly written - and, as always in such cases, it illuminates
much more than simply the remarkable main subject.

<HEAD>Fund-Raising for Chimp Play Area Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELLENSBURG, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Washington University's
``talking'' chimpanzees will get a new home next year, and
fund-raising efforts are under way to give them a place to play as
well.
   While the Legislature has authorized a $1.5 million home for the
chimps, lawmakers did not finance an outdoor play and exercise area
for the five chimpanzees _ the first in the world to learn human
sign language.
   Researchers Roger and Debbi Fouts said they need to raise
$650,000 to build a secure outdoor area that will provide the
chimps with sunlight, swinging and climbing apparatus and other
benefits.
   The drive began in Seattle in January with a fund-raiser, with
Gov. Booth Gardner as host. The Fouts also intend to solicit
donations by mail.
   The new home and play area are essential for the chimps, who
have been caged on the third floor of the university's Psychology
Building for years, Fouts said.
   ``Washoe hasn't seen the sun in 10 years,'' Fouts said. Washoe
was the first animal ever to learn a human language.
   The research has been under way at the school since 1980, when
Fouts moved to this small central Washington farm and college town
from the University of Oklahoma.
   Financing has been a constant struggle.
   While Fouts is paid as a faculty member of the university, Ms.
Fouts is a volunteer, and chimp care depends on the help of up to
15 students. The university provides just $1,000 a year for the
chimps' care.
   Financial help comes from 500 subscribers who pay $25 a year for
the Fouts' newsletter. Much of the chimps' food is donated by
grocery stores and farmers, Fouts said.
   Pizza parlors occasionally donate pizzas. ``Washoe doesn't like
pepperoni,'' Ms. Fouts said.
   The new building was needed because the constant cleaning of the
animals' cages was causing water damage to the Psychology Building
and their noise disrupted classes.
   The new building, set for groundbreaking this spring and
completion next year, also will bring better public access to the
chimps, which the Fouts hope will increase donations.
   The chimps weigh up to 150 pounds and have the strength of eight
grown men, so security is important. ``People in Ellensburg
wouldn't want them walking into their houses and looking in the
refrigerator,'' Fouts said.
   The Fouts' research is behavioral, not biomedical, so a good
environment for the chimps is essential to good results.
   ``We're hoping this gives them more things to sign about, and
more interesting things to do,'' Fouts said. The ability to swing
more freely by the arms will also make the chimps happier, he said.
   To the Fouts, the Washoe Project is ``like the moon shot of the
behavioral sciences.''

<HEAD>Sheba Counting Her Way To Fame</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH GRACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheba isn't a typical 6-year-old just
because she likes candy, playing with the telephone and coloring.
   Sheba is a chimpanzee who knows how to count.
   The chimp, who lives at Ohio State University's animal
laboratory here, is one of only two monkeys in the world able to
count, and the only one that understands the concept of zero, said
Sally Boysen, director of the lab's primate cognition project.
   Boysen said last week she believes that ability is a major step
forward in defining the cognitive processes of higher primates and
their similarities to those of humans.
   Boysen, who said the ability to count objects involves a
different cognitive process than learning languages, was one of the
participants in early studies that showed higher primates can learn
language.
   More than a decade ago, Koko, a female gorilla, and Washoe, a
female chimp, learned to use sign language to communicate with
humans.
   But counting is a new research goal, and a hobby Sheba indulges
in when she is not playing with her keepers, with the four other
apes at the lab or with Boysen's dog Schuyler, who is her best
friend.
   The chimp also dials telephone numbers at random when no one is
watching.
   Sheba, a lab-born chimp owned by The Columbus Zoo, will appear
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' this week and is the subject
of a People magazine story due out this month.
   The surrogate mother-daughter relationship between Boysen and
Sheba and their mutual teasing has helped the chimp ignore the
attention and get to work.
   In a recent demonstration, Sheba was placed on the floor in
front of a small, rectangular yellow plate. Above that was placed
plastic squares with numbers ranging from zero to seven, mixed
randomly. Boysen then placed four apples on the plate.
   ``OK, Sheba. We're going to count some apples. How many?''
Boysen asked. Sheba, fighting a desire to mug for a photographer,
touched each apple, then pointed to the number five and looked to
Boysen for approval.
   ``You know that is not five apples. Try to tell me how many,''
Boysen said. Sheba counted again and pointed to the number seven.
   It took another try and a hallway conference between Boysen and
Sheba before the ape finally ignored the photographer and picked
the correct number. Sheba was rewarded with a kiss and a handful of
M&amp;Ms and gumdrops.
   Boysen has worked with Sheba for almost five years, and says the
association has been rewarding from the start, even though Sheba
would rather be playing.
   ``They have such a short attention span,'' Boysen said. ``At
first she wouldn't try at all. But then she began to show us she
could learn fast.''

   Foodmaker Inc.'s net income in its fiscal fourth quarter more than doubled from year-earlier net of $2.1 million, or 20 cents a share, Jack W. Goodall Jr., chairman and president, said. 

   Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 27 increased to between $146.1 million and $147.4 million from last year's $132.8 million, he said. 

   Mr. Goodall, in an interview, attributed the increase in results to success of three products the company introduced this year at its Jack in the Box fast-food restaurants: the Fajita Pita sandwich, Hot Club Supreme sandwich and Ultimate Cheeseburger. 

   For the year, he said, Foodmaker had about a 50% increase in net, to about $13.8 million, compared with earnings of $9.2 million, or 84 cents a share, earned in fiscal 1986. 
He said revenue for the year increased 7% to 10%, to between $595.5 million and $612.2 million, from the year-earlier $556.5 million. 

   Despite the strong earnings performance, Foodmaker doesn't plan to pay a dividend, Mr. Goodall said. 
Instead, the company will use profit to pay down long-term debt, now totaling $242.7 million, and for capital expansion. 
During fiscal 1988, Foodmaker plans to convert 70 of its 639 company-operated restaurants to franchises, and to build 70 new restaurants that will be operated by the company. 
Jack in the Box franchises now total 259. 

   Jack in the Box's menu has broadened widely from the burger-and-fries staples of the 1950s and 1960s. 

   "Toward the end of the '70s, we could see that McDonald's was winning that race, and we needed to find a new niche," Mr. Goodall said. 
The company has since targeted a more upscale, adult market with its "very adult, eclectic menu." 

   Foodmaker stock began trading publicly in February. 
Jack in the Box operations were purchased in a leveraged buyout from Ralston Purina Co. in September 1985.

   ELY, Minn. -- Biologist Lynn Rogers knows black bears the
way Dian Fossey knew gorillas. Over some 22 years he has
tracked them, crawled into their dens, slept next to them in
the wild, been charged by them and shared food with them.
   Through his eyes, their full complexity first emerged:
Neither Gentle Bens nor fierce attackers, they are generally
as shy as rabbits, curious as raccoons, smart as dogs,
irascible as blue jays and contrary as cats. Demonstrating
the latter, one lumbers out of the woods near this little
town reeking of rotten fish. She had smeared fish on her head
like styling jell, perversely presenting herself soon after
Dr. Rogers had declared that it is a myth black bears are
smelly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Dr. Rogers, a U.S. Forest Service researcher who
studies bears in the Superior National Forest near here, is
about to teach the stinker a lesson. He tails her as she
follows her nose to a campground with a tent, picnic table,
ice chest and, for the moment, no people. "This is a dream
come true" for a bear, he murmurs.
   As she closes in on the food, he jolts her with an
electric "shock" collar he has strapped around her neck and
controls from a hand-held radio transmitter. She bounds out
of the camp, plops down 50 feet away, shakes her head like a
dog and moans. "I'm mean to that bear {who he has named
Gerry} because I like her," says Dr. Rogers, an affable,
burly man who earlier shocked his own neck to make sure the
collar wouldn't hurt a bear.
   Gerry is a "nuisance" bear, one of a growing number of the
omnivores that amble into human habitats to forage for
marshmallows, toothpaste and eggs Benedict. Black-bear
country, encompassing most of North America's large forested
tracts, has been invaded by ski condos, vacation homes and
retirement cottages -- food centers that attract bears the
way bug zappers lure insects. The result is carnage:
Intruding bears almost never hurt people but often are gunned
down by homeowners.
   Black bears aren't an endangered species, and Dr. Rogers,
52, has spent his career trying to keep it that way. His
early studies, indicating bear numbers were declining due to
unregulated hunting, helped inspire laws that make bears
state-regulated game animals with limited hunting seasons.
While pioneering techniques to study bears (such as mapping
their movements with radio-tracking collars), he has defined
habitat ingredients that forest managers must preserve for
bears to thrive. In recent years, he has conducted close-up
studies of bear life that have helped show how bears and
people can coexist. Prominent Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson
compares his work to Jane Goodall's landmark chimpanzee
studies in Africa.
   Some excerpts from the Rogers canon: Black-bear society is
a matriarchy in which mothers establish and oversee
territories of several square miles, parceling out pieces to
female offspring like dowries. Among the flora bears need
most are mature white pines -- mothers use them as day-care
centers for posting cubs out of harm's way while foraging.
Black-bear mothers, unlike grizzlies, don't aggressively
defend cubs.
   If a black bear approaches, stand tall, roar and wing a
rock at it, advises Dr. Rogers. The animals very rarely
attack. Dr. Rogers says he has often been lunged at -- and
even run over by a frantic bear -- but never injured. Once,
he recalls, the mother of a squawking cub he was holding
unexpectedly rushed him. He gingerly held the cub out. She
gently took it in her mouth and walked away.
   While not given to violent crimes, black bears have
larceny in their hearts. To help deal with that, Mr. Rogers
is developing a special dumpster designed to thwart a typical
bear trick -- jumping up and down on the top to bend open the
edges. For hardened thieves, the shock collar he has just
started testing may help.
   He is investigating it as a way to rehabilitate nuisance
bears of all kinds, including the endangered grizzly. His
first trainee, however, is Gerry. This small black bear has a
unique affinity for humans -- in fact, she may be the only
wild bear a person can give a bear hug to.
   Gerry is one of several "human habituated" black bears
that Dr. Rogers and assistants have spent so much time with
that the animals now mostly ignore people following them.
But, like more typical bears, other habituated ones shrink
from being touched and "bluff" charging at humans that get
too close. The bluff charge is an explosive lunging, blowing
and chomping of teeth that doesn't mean "You're about to die,
yuppie scum," as one might assume without Dr. Rogers there to
translate -- but rather, "I'm nervous, please stand back."
   Gerry, however, doesn't mind being touched, and sometimes
even paws and mouths friendly people like a playful pup --
though quickly backs off when growled at by people who don't
want to play. Rolling over the 175-pound, three-fourths-grown
bear to take her temperature rectally, Dr. Rogers explains
that she is enabling him to gather unprecedented data on bear
metabolism -- a subject of longstanding interest to medical
researchers. During hibernation, for example, bear bone and
muscle tissue is continually renewed to prevent atrophy, a
trick physicians would like to replicate in people with
osteoporosis and other degenerative diseases.
   Gerry also is ideal for the shock-collar study: "If we can
condition this bear to stay out of trouble, we can condition
any bear," says Dr. Rogers. While he has tailed her today,
she has wandered through a pickup basketball game, opened the
door of a government building and sneaked in, flirtatiously
rested a paw on a reporter's leg and unsuccessfully tried to
make friends with a barking dog. (Most of the time, however,
she rambled in the woods doing normal bear things: Tearing
into a hornets nest, resting, climbing trees to get at seeds,
resting, marking her territory with urine and then taking a
long nap.)
   Gerry's sociability originated in cubhood. She was
orphaned when her mother bolted -- freaked out by curious
people who gathered at her den -- and spent several crucial,
formative weeks with Dr. Rogers and other humans as they
scouted for another wild mother to adopt her. They succeeded;
she was raised wild. But she retained fond feelings for
humans.
   Most people in these parts say they adore Gerry. Asked
about her, one resident proudly pulls out a wallet photo of
herself standing next to the bear. But Dr. Rogers fears his
habituated bears would be sitting ducks for visiting hunters,
so last year he organized local volunteers to walk with the
bears through much of the six-week, fall hunting season. This
year, dozens of bear walkers have flown in from across the
U.S. and overseas, sent by a Boston-based group called
Earthwatch, which organizes volunteers to help on scientific
projects. They have served as escorts and helped conduct the
first detailed, round-the-clock study of bear life over many
days.
   But earlier this month, one of Dr. Rogers's
human-habituated bears, a mother of two cubs, wandered
outside her usual territory and was shot by a hunter. It was
a blow to his research -- and something like losing an old
friend.
   Today, Gerry's army is in full force. Pied-piper-like, she
has attracted a small crowd of youngsters, including Dr.
Rogers's two daughters, ages 9 and 10, who have come to see
the shock-collar experiment. With them are Earthwatch
volunteers, watching her every move and madly scribbling
notes. Dr. Rogers leads with the shock controller. After a
few lessons, Gerry bypasses picnic tables and doors, casting
longing glances at them and ruefully whimpering. Finally, a
delighted Dr. Rogers joshingly asks whether he should zap her
for doing cute things that attract people. A shout goes up:
"No]"

FT  25 SEP 93 / Books: Totally mad about otters - The life of Gavin Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GAVIN MAXWELL
by Douglas Botting
HarperCollins Pounds 22.50, 585 pages
DO PEOPLE who love animals exceedingly - excessively - have something wrong
with them? My question may seem mischievous, but it is likely to occur to
readers of this superb biography of Gavin Maxwell, 'the otter man' of the
1960s. Crusty old Wilfred Thesiger, that uncompromising Arabian explorer,
who once took Maxwell on a journey to the Marsh Arabs, evidently had his
doubts about his companion: 'Personally I think if people go to extremes
where animals become more important than human beings, then they ought to be
locked up', he opines, recalling what he described as Maxwell's hysterics
over the death of an otter cub they had had for less than a week.
Gavin Maxwell certainly had his problems. He was a grandson of the Duke of
Northumberland, a Percy on his mother's side, with a childhood to guarantee
neuroses ahead. He never knew his father, slept in his doting mother's bed
until he was eight, enjoyed a solitary and idyllic early childhood in the
Scottish Lowlands, was traumatised, according to the pattern, by prep
school, and suffered a serious illness in his teens.
He was thereafter an explorer (on a modest scale), one of the best shots in
Britain, a wartime instructor in the SOE, a shark-hunter off the Highlands,
a society portrait painter - and one of the finest nature writers of this
century. He was homosexual; he drank, and smoked, very heavily; he seems to
have been a manic depressive. He must have had great charm, though he was
also disliked by some people for his arrogant manner. His financial affairs
were undisciplined. He died, of cancer, at 55.
And he loved animals. Douglas Botting's thesis, though he does not insist,
is that he was emotionally atrophied, 'for ever an adolescent in his
attitude to the adult world, his sexual relations and his interests and
enthusiasms'. A male friend describes him as 'two different people - the
respectable public figure (the aristocratic painter, author, ex-Guards
officer and member of learned societies) and the less respectable private
one (the homosexual, the outlaw, the fearful, repressed, inhibited inner
man) . . . The externalisation of his emotional life led to a mistrust of
relationships with adults, so that he only felt safe in the animal world,
the natural world . . . '
This is the world in which he will always be remembered. As Mr Botting puts
it, correctly, 'Gavin Maxwell was to otters what Joy Adamson was to lions,
Dian Fossey to gorillas, Jane Goodall to chimpanzees and Grey Owl to
beavers'. (Which goes some way towards the first sentence of this review.)
He came to otters by accident. After the success of his first book, Harpoon
at a Venture, in which he described the disaster of his post-war attempt to
hunt the Basking Shark in Scottish waters, he went off to the Gulf with
Thesiger where he produced a very fine travel book called A Reed Shaken by
the Wind. There he discovered otters, and brought Mijbil back to his remote
cottage near Mallaig, opposite Skye, soon to be immortalised by him as
'Camusfearna'. Edal and Teko were to follow.
Ring of Bright Water came out in 1960 and was a colossal best-seller. Why?
Partly because it was so well written, partly because it offered escape. It
arrived at the beginning of the 1960s enthusiasm for the Good Life; in more
respectful language, it coincided with a new interest in alternative
life-styles and anticipated what we today call the New Age movement. In
Maxwell's words, 'I am convinced that man has suffered in his separation
from the soil and from other living creatures of the world; the evolution of
his intellect has outrun his needs as an animal . . .'
Hence the popular fascination with the story of a man who goes off to live
on a northern sea-shore in a remote house with no mod. cons., makes best
friends with an otter, and then writes about his fun and games - and
sadnesses - with these simple creatures.
It was never, of course, as simple as it sounded, as Maxwell always
emphasised. The success of the books in itself destroyed the integrity, and
the seclusion, of 'Camusfearna'. And otters were not the only friends. There
was the poet Kathleen Raine, for example, still happily with us today, who
conceived a grand infatuation for the handsome but unresponding Maxwell; she
comes out of this book as a self-regarding witch (and also a very bad poet).
Her obsession with Maxwell is no joke because he half-believed in her
'powers' and when he discovered she had laid a curse on his life he was
ready to believe he had been destroyed. There followed a terrible sequence
of tragedy: the otters turned savage, there were financial disasters,
'Camusfearna' burned to the ground, and in 1969 he died.
Botting, who knew Maxwell for the last 12 years, never forgets that the
books are what matter. After Ring of Bright Water (a line taken from one of
Ms Raine's poems) there were The Rocks Remain and Raven Seek Thy Brother. He
also wrote two excellent books about Sicily, and Lords of the Atlas, a
superior historical study of Morocco, a country he used to visit to indulge
his wilder tastes.
Botting is discreet about the homosexuality and explains that he is
respecting the wishes of the estate. He has the sense to caution that this
might have the effect of exaggerating the importance of the female
relationships, which he feels able to describe more candidly, including a
sad marriage. (There is one wonderful misprint or mishearing where Ms Raine,
in full poetic flood, describes Maxwell as 'the poor Eternus'. As a Jungian,
she presumably said Puer Aeternus.) Throughout a long but never exhausting
book Botting writes beautifully, except for a very occasional tendency to
overreach himself.
He assures us that there are still otters at Sandaig (as 'Camusfearna' is
known on the maps), though the landscape has changed. Apparently the new
bridge to Skye will destroy Kyleakin Island, where Maxwell took refuge for
his last year. All his life he knew that he was in search of Avalon, where
he might hope to heal Tennyson's grievous wound. Perhaps, for just those
first years with the otters, he found it.

THE THREAT AND THE GLORY REFLECTIONS ON SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS BY P.D. MEDAWAR

<TEXT>
<P>
I wish I had known Peter Medawar, the British Nobelist who received the prize 
for physiology or medicine in 1960. Those who did, speak of him with awe. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts he was brilliant and gracious, a humanist with a gift for 
explaining his passion in graceful prose. 
</P>
<P>
As a scientist he expanded the curative power of medicine when he successfully 
grafted "foreign" cells onto an animal still in utero, overcoming the problem 
of tissue rejection and opening up the field of immunology, including the 
ability to transplant organs from one individual to another. 
</P>
<P>
He was a towering figure literally (he stood more than 6 feet tall) and 
figuratively, with students and friends around the world. Medawar wrote for the 
general public and was frequently invited to lecture and review. 
</P>
<P>
"The Threat and the Glory: Reflections on Science and Scientists" is a 
posthumous collection of these articles and talks, some published before, 
others in print for the first time, all reflecting Medawar's thoughts about 
science from the late 1950s until his death in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The 23 chapters range from fascinating "bench" stories of life in the lab, such 
as "The Strange Case of the Spotted Mice," to a defense of the use of animals 
in research, six talks about "The Future of Man" delivered in 1959, and 
thoughts on dying, written between the strokes that incapacitated him but never 
completely prevented him from working. 
</P>
<P>
As director of Britain's National Institute for Medical Research, Medawar was 
often attacked by antivivisectionists. In the Paget Lecture in 1966, sponsored 
by the Research Defense Society, he addressed the use of experimental animals 
to enlarge medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Trained initially as a zoologist, Medawar was interested in evolutionary 
theory, especially the question of "fitness" in humans as well as animals. He 
thought of the animal rights sentiment in Britain as a recent trend -- going 
back only 170 years -- and faulted rights advocates for their sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
Then turning to the National Institute for Medical Research, where animals were 
bred and cared for by professionals familiar with their genetic composition and 
history, he supported what he referred to as "the 3 R's of humane laboratory 
practice: Reduction, Refinement and Replacement": reduction in numbers of 
animals used, refinement of experimental techniques, and their eventual 
replacement by tissue culture and computer simulation. 
</P>
<P>
What is interesting for an American reader is the directive that in Britain 
animals can be used only when an immediate medical application is foreseen. 
Medawar found this restriction cramping. He emphasized the need for pure 
research, which would necessitate the use of more animals in the laboratory. He 
acknowledged the right of the general public to know about all animal research 
but wanted this research expanded to include any that would advance human 
welfare. And Medawar defined human welfare as more than physical health, but as 
the satisfaction of what he saw as a species-specific compulsion to explore the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Critics today, including scientists like Jane Goodall, suggest that the 
satisfaction of human curiosity is not the unmitigated good that has been 
preached since the Enlightenment, and that science can overstep its role. 
Medawar would adamantly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too late now to adopt an intellectually pastoral existence . . . too 
late to cease to be ambitious." And for this ambition to be satisfied, he 
maintained, living animals will be needed for research, albeit in declining 
numbers, for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
Medawar was an unabashed "speciesist" who made no apologies for his 
championship of Homo sapiens. In "The Future of Man," six talks for the Reith 
lectures of 1959 that compose a third of this volume, Medawar pondered our 
evolutionary future, including the possibility that advances in medicine may be 
regressive, enabling the supposedly "unfit" to reproduce "and the dangers, real 
or imagined, of the genetic deterioration brought about by the propagation of 
the genetically unfit." 
</P>
<P>
These fears are part of an English scientific preoccupation with degeneration, 
articulated earlier in the century by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and much 
disputed by later scientists. 
</P>
<P>
This chapter is filled with interesting facts about population changes -- that 
older mothers tend to have daughters rather than sons -- and that populations 
that consciously limit family size tend to complete their families while young, 
and thus reduce the average gap between generations. What would he have made of 
the tendency today for late marriages and delayed births, which also result in 
small families but with increased gaps between generations? 
</P>
<P>
Medawar was apparently a charismatic figure, as witnessed in the foreword by 
Lewis Thomas. His inspirational thoughts in "The Life Instinct and Dignity in 
Dying" suggest why he elicited such broad affection. The volume is, inevitably, 
a mixed bag, rich in good scientific storytelling, but also already a 
period-piece, reflecting biases of place and class.

Imagination," edited by D. Michael Shafer (Beacon Press).

<TEXT>
THE GREAT APE PROJECT by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer Fourth Estate
Pounds 9.99, 312 pages
LET US admit our fellow Great Apes - the chimpanzees, gorillas and
orang-utans - to the same moral community as ourselves, thereby according
them rights to life, to liberty, and to protection against torture -
especially the kind of torture inflicted in the name of scientific research.
Such, in sum, is the message of this important and spectacularly fascinating
collection of essays. Written by some of the world's foremost scientists and
philosophers, it launches the 'Great Ape Project', a campaign to bring our
fellow apes within the sphere of ethical concern at present reserved for
humans alone. And it does so in a highly readable and educative manner,
crammed with wide-ranging discussions of apes' use of language, the
evolution of the ape family, ape learning and behaviour, and lucidly written
accounts of the project's philosophical and legal implications.
All the Great Apes are so closely related that there is a mere 1.6 per cent
difference in the genetic constitution of humans and chimpanzees. The family
trees of today's humans and chimpanzees stem from the same ancestors less
than 7m years ago. Go back only another 2 or 3m years, and the human-chimp
branch of the clan shares common ancestors with today's gorillas. Ten
million years is a brief span in the history of life on earth. Yet we do not
need to contemplate this tiny evolutionary divergence, or the genetic
proximity between members of the Great Ape family, to recognise their
kinship: it was obvious long before scientists measured it.
It is indeed because of this very genetic closeness that some of the Great
Apes - chiefly, chimpanzees - are kept in captivity and subjected to medical
experiments for the benefit of other Great Apes - namely, humans. Imagine
this: a group of humans embarks on a colonial adventure, in the course of
which they capture specimens of other humans from other continents, and
exhibit them in their zoos - or, suitably stuffed and mounted, in their
museums; they breed them in research laboratories for experimental purposes;
they even hunt them for sport. Would there be much difference between this
and the way we treat our fellow apes? Humans have done - and sometimes still
do - these things to other humans, but we condemn their behaviour. The
eloquent argument of this book is that subjecting our fellow apes to this
treatment is equally wrong.
Chimpanzees do not have larynxes like humans, and therefore cannot vocalise
as humans do. But they can use language. Several essays describe the
acquisition of sign or code languages by chimpanzees, up to a developed
competence similar to that of a two-and-a-half year old human child. This
language-possession is genuine; it is not merely an elaborate mastery of
tricks, such as a circus dog might display. Chimpanzees formulate novel
sentences with which to communicate ideas and emotions, and they do so in
the course of their relations with their human companions in an entirely
natural way. This fact alone demands of us a radical shift in our attitudes
to them: how can we speak to them and yet still expropriate their forest
homes, lock them up in zoos, and inject fatal viruses into them?
Non-human apes, especially gorillas, were until recently demonised in film
and literature. Their similarity to us was used not as proof of kindred but
as a means of symbolising the supposed bestiality within us. When Dr Jekyll
drank his potion he exposed a mythologized savage inheritance; in some
depictions, his hands grow hairy, his brow beetles, his teeth enlarge: he
becomes a horrifying gorilla-man.
In the popular imagination, if it is not violence then it is stupidity which
marks the ape, betokened by tree-swinging, armpit-scratching and gibbering.
One way to insult someone is to call him an ape. Yet our fellow apes are
intelligent, inquisitive, affectionate and sociable creatures, with
capacities for suffering and grief that match our own, and with a grave
beauty and dignity to which many of these essays testify.
If you can think of arguments against treating non-human apes just as we
treat human apes - if, in particular, you think they should be accorded
fewer rights than humans - you will be sure to find powerful
counter-arguments to your view somewhere in this rich spread of essays. The
editors have performed splendidly in choosing and monitoring contributions
in such a way that every essay is a model of lucidity, informativeness, and
substance. Together the essays present an overwhelming case for a revision
in our treatment of our fellow apes. The editors and contributors press for
immediate acceptance of a 'Declaration' which demands for all Great Apes the
rights of life, liberty, and security from torture and experimentation.
Their essays powerfully show why we should agree.

<P>
The editorial is little more than a mean-spirited tirade directed against 
animal rights activists. Referring to these activists as cranks, and as being 
self-absorbed and vulgar, and as people engaged in self-righteous tantrums is 
uncalled for. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue in the View Section there is an article about Jane Goodall, a 
scientist of unquestionable reputation, whose attitude concerning medical 
research on animals is much more reasonable than that presented on the 
Editorial Page. She advocates that more money and research be invested in 
funding alternative research methods and that there be more effective 
supervision to see that the animals in medical laboratories receive the best 
possible treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Surely there must be ways of discovering medical knowledge other than 
continually torturing so many helpless animals. If there is such a thing as a 
just God, the human species will be punished for its cruel treatment of other 
animals.

<TEXT>     Scientists generally thought non-human species deal only in the present.;  
 But Savage-Rumbaugh said she and her husband, Duane Rumbaugh, have proved
that chimps can "recall events and wonder about things that they cannot
understand.";    When Kanzi's mother, Matata, was moved from the research
center, Kanzi, working with a keyboard on which symbols represent words, asked
his handlers, "Matata hide?";    He searched several places, including a spot
where he once found her hiding, and at each location repeated the question.;  
 To allay Kanzi's anxiety, Savage-Rumbaugh made a videotape of Matata and
showed it to him. He jumped, yelled, and demanded to see it again and again.; 
  Finally, he seemed satisfied that his mother was OK, and he calmed down.;   
In April, the Rumbaughs concluded a nine-month study in which they found that
Kanzi, a bonobo chimp, understood and responded to the English language at the
level of a 2-year-old child.;    Duane Rumbaugh said the study was the "first
time in science that there has been really strong data collected under
controlled conditions" that any animal can understand human language.;    In
the study, Kanzi correctly responded to specific requests on 79 percent of 660
test sentences he had never heard before.;    Some scientists lauded the work,
while others said the chimp was merely responding to non-verbal signals from
his handlers.;    The Rumbaughs founded the Language Research Center in 1981.
At the center, chimpanzees provided by Yerkes Center for Primate Research are
studied with a view to defining processes that are basic to first-language
skills.;    The research results are being used to teach children with severe
mental retardation to communicate symbolically with their classmates, teachers
and parents.  </TEXT>

FT  28 JUL 93 / Management: Pizza to stay - with extra tenacity - A bankrupt
company is every manager's nightmare. How one man survived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Stateside Foods ever becomes grand enough to merit a coat of arms, Roy
Goodall has his Latin motto ready - nunc etiam adsumus, meaning 'we are
still here.'
The English version has been his standard phrase to customers inquiring
after Stateside's corporate health during the past 18 months. It lost Pounds
1.65m during 1990 and 1991, scraped through to break even last year, but is
forecasting Pounds 526,000 profits for 1993 on projected sales of Pounds
5.5m.
The company makes chilled pizzas for half a dozen supermarket chains at its
factory in Haslingden, Lancashire. Checks on its health followed lay-offs, a
withdrawal of overdraft facilities by its bank and a whispering campaign by
some competitors in the UK pizza makers' war for supermarket shelf space.
In the jargon of corporate finance, the company is a bimbo - a
buy-in-management-buyout. In September 1991, Goodall bought into a
management-buyout gone wrong. It needed his expertise as a former
big-company general manager and, before that, a marketing man.
The company had been bought by its management two years before, but
inadequate controls had seen rapid sales growth offset by deepening trading
losses.
Goodall's career had plateaued with middle age. He and his wife decided to
do something on their own and opted for Stateside.
But, as Goodall told a CBI-Grant Thornton north-west regional conference
last month, a nightmare was about to begin. After three months, he upgraded
the quality of its advisers from the 'man and a dog' level his predecessors
had been content with and discovered that the balance sheet had a Pounds
500,000 hole in it.
Over-optimism had led to mis-statements of creditors, debtors, stocks and
assets which the previous auditors had ticked, rather than challenged.
The accounts had looked satisfactory at the time of the buy-in, but it
needed some hands-on experience of Goodall's type to make the realistic
assumptions that would pierce the facade.
As the reality sank in, he realised he was in up to his neck in a bankrupt
company. In the days between Christmas and New Year, he told his bank. The
business was originally founded in the Midlands and the bank was 170 miles
away. He and the manager hardly knew each other. Facilities were immediately
withdrawn. 'I certainly don't blame them,' he says. 'I would have done the
same.'
An interview followed with an insolvency practitioner which made Goodall
feel much better. He was told he was legally obliged to act in the best
interests of Stateside's creditors. Here was a dilemma. Closed down,
Stateside's assets would not fetch enough to pay everyone off, but the
company was by then trading in profit on a day-to-day basis and he believed
its sales forecast was healthy and realistic, with a firm contractual base.
The creditors' best chance of getting their money was for Stateside to carry
on trading - without incurring more debt, as this would have been illegal.
The main creditors took the point and converted what they were owed into
medium-term loans, bolstering the balance sheet and taking pressure off cash
flow.
Sales were factored, so that 80 per cent of revenue was immediately
guaranteed each week and supplies could be bought on a pay-as-you-go basis.
'If you want to see just-in-time practised as an art form, we are it,'
Goodall says.
The payroll had already been slimmed from 80 to 34. He told everyone what
was going on, asked for commitment and co-operation - and Stateside gingerly
started trading its way out of the nightmare.
Confidence grew with sales, and Stateside made an important capital purchase
 -a second-hand burglar alarm, bought for cash, after a spate of pizza
robberies. Next came a Tannoy and music system to bolster morale on the
production line.
By this time last year, suppliers and - encouragingly - would-be suppliers
resumed talking about credit. Sales grew and Stateside achieved a Pounds
200,000 trading profit last year, although this was reduced to break-even,
pre-tax, by finance charges. The company now looks like surviving. Two
prospective buyers have already been turned down. Sales, production and
profits are rising weekly.
Goodall is confident enough to talk about his experience and pass on what he
hopes are the lessons. The 60 company owners and their advisers at the
conference - on why some companies break through to big growth while others
do not - listened spellbound.
Tenacity, commitment and realism were some of his messages. Others concerned
simplicity of vision, hard work, consistent quality of product and making
the best use of people. 'The majority of venture capitalists and bankers
only look at the balance sheet and past performance,' he said.
'The emphasis is on the past, which usually undervalues the business and
most certainly undervalues the people. Surely, sustainable profits and
earnings per share are what really count.'
He stressed the need for good professional advice, even though this might
cost more. Cheap audits cannot be worthwhile if they merely comply with
legal requirements and do not reveal the company is heading towards
bankruptcy.
Advisers should add value, offering constructive criticism to ensure
accounts reflect reality.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons falls to Pounds 722,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of a substantial contraction in interest charges, pre-tax profits
at Hopkinsons Holdings, the industrial abrasives, plastic products and gas
control equipment group, showed another sharp decline over the six months to
July 31.
According to Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, the outcome, as anticipated, was
equal to the second half of the previous year at Pounds 722,000 (Pounds
1.34m).
Although Carborundum Abrasives returned to profit, Bryan Donkin Engineering,
still hit by uncertainty over the capital spending plans of British Gas, its
biggest customer, suffered a further decline in orders. Activities in
Germany continued to be affected by recession and the strong D-Mark, which
placed further pressure on sales and margins.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 51.7m (Pounds 51.3m); Mr Goodall said
that the comparison was flattered by exchange rate movements which disguised
a real decline of 6.5 per cent.
Borrowings were reduced by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 11.4m by end-July and by a
further Pounds 2.5m since then; gearing currently stands at 28 per cent (41
per cent).
After a nil tax charge, reflecting German losses and the release of tax
provisions, earnings per share emerged at 0.91p (0.89p). The interim
dividend is 0.5p (0.9p) but Mr Goodall said the intention was to maintain
the total at last year's 1.3p.
