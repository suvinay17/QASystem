<LEADPARA>  PLAYING a Fender guitar is somewhat like driving a very powerful car,
preferably American-made -- perhaps a 1967 Corvette.;    In the case of the
three-pickup Stratocaster model, you find that this sculpted piece of wood
with two curved teeth by the fingerboard -- an instrument built for Batman --
fits the human body surprisingly well. After you've plugged it into an
amplifier (perhaps a Fender Twin Reverb from the late '60s), you suddenly are
capable of producing the most alarming . . . sound.  </LEADPARA>

THE ENGINEER OF ROCK 'N' ROLL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Such was the legacy of Clarence Leo Fender, the force behind one of the
century's enduring American artifacts -- the solid-body electric guitar. If
rock 'n' roll was invented by Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley and Little
Richard, it was Fender and his company who launched the music's true machine.;
   Purists will argue that Fender, a Fullerton resident who died last month at
82, was not the first to make such a device. Claims are made for the
Rickenbacker company, and for the remarkable Les Paul, who also produced music
from a solid piece of wood in the 1940s (eventually manufactured by Fender's
American arch-rival, the Gibson Corp.). Acoustic guitars had been electrified
for jazz since the 1930s, and perhaps before.;    It was Fender's genius,
though, to mass-produce the solid-wood design that not only made the raucous,
reverberating sounds of rock, but also managed to look the part.;    Like
Levi's and Coca-Cola, the Stratocaster and its more basic cousin, the
Telecaster swept the world in the early '50s. Both have since been copied and
recopied by just about every guitar maker from New York to South Korea. But if
their design can be found everywhere, nothing has quite duplicated the spirit
of the originals.;    Tom Wheeler, in his encyclopedic book "American
Guitars," perfectly catches their visual audacity: "Fender guitars were rock
and roll, jet-age, outrageous. They were as futuristic as Sputnik, or as tacky
as all the sequins in Webb Pierce's wardrobe, depending on your point of view.
Before Fender, there were no turquoise musical instruments, no Candy Apple
Red, scoop-body dragsters with gold-plated hardware and white plastic knobs.";
   Fender's creations became not only the sound of rock 'n' roll, but its
history. Such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Eric Clapton became
inseparable from their Stratocasters (and, in some cases, from their onstage
demolition of them.);    Inevitably, anyone who admired these Strat players
(or Telecaster players such as Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards and Danny
Gatton) would want to own such odd-looking, interesting instruments -- and
would treasure them.;    It is a wonderful aural coincidence that the words
Strad and Strat sound so much alike: A violinist will talk about his
Stradivarius with the same reverence that a rock guitarist will speak about
his Stratocaster.;    The father of the Strat was no great fan of rock.
Rather, Fender was fascinated by the way you could get sounds by placing
magnets under the metal strings of guitars.;    He experimented with coils of
different sizes and impedances -- more intrigued, perhaps, by capacitors than
by harmonies. He held dozens of patents, and so much attention was lavished on
his guitars that one could overlook the fact he made the world's first
electric bass in 1951 -- an instrument that also changed pop music forever.;  
 With astounding understatement, he once said, "I never had too much feeling
for the acoustic guitars. I had always felt that the guitar could do a much
better job if it wasn't limited by the properties of that vibrating top.";   
For him, the combinations of sound, once you were freed from the acoustic
limit, seemed infinite. With a revolutionary three pickups (the Stratocaster
version; Telecasters had only two) and the proper amplifier, musicians could
fill a large room. With enough amplification, they would discover soon enough,
their devices could fill a stadium.;    But even a beginner learns that with a
little experimentation, a mere flick of the wrist, the Fender sound can be
sustained, or vibrated -- and cranked up. It can be turned into Hendrix-like
feedback or Stevie Ray Vaughan-like blues or the B.B. King-like solos on those
Rolling Stones albums.;    This is not a guitar for "Michael, Row the Boat
Ashore." Even on the first test drive, you can imagine it assaulting Jericho's
walls.;    In time, caught in the entropy of our century, things went
downhill. Fender sold the company to CBS in 1965, and since then connoisseurs
of Strats and Teles have looked for the phrase "pre-CBS" whenever one was
sold.;    Guitars that were traded routinely for under $200 in the 1950s and
early 1960s suddenly were going for thousands.;    "Fender Stratocaster, 1957,
Sunburst, Been Through Hell. $5,000" is still a typical advertisement.
Eventually, the unthinkable happened: Fenders were made in Japan. Some still
are, although the company's present owners again are making them in the United
States.;    Fender himself, the man Wheeler calls the "Henry Ford of electric
guitars," continued to build them. He founded G &amp; L Musical Products, and many
G &amp; L instruments are much prized.;    By most accounts, Fender was outwardly
the perfect nerd, absorbed by mechanical things until the end. "He rarely
wears a suit, and he's almost never without his little leather holster full of
screwdrivers," said a long-ago profile in Guitar Player. "In his shirt, he
keeps a plastic pocket protector stuffed with pens, pencils and a metal
ruler.";    He never learned to play the guitar. (box)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     While Mr. Fender did not invent the electric guitar, he did revolutionize
and perfect it. Called both the Henry Ford and the Thomas Edison of the
instrument, Mr. Fender's solid-body guitars and amplifiers set the industry
standard for excellence.;    "Fender was a phenomenon," said Peter Schuelzky,
general manager of the Guitar Center in Hollywood. "He created the guitar (to)
which all other manufacturers try to conform. . . . Nobody has been quite as
successful.";    Electric guitars made Mr. Fender, a tinkerer and inventor by
nature, a millionaire.;    In 1954, he created the Stratocaster, a
revolutionary instrument hailed as a near-perfect fusion of electronics,
ergonomics and technology on one side, and design and aesthetics on the
other.;    "The Stratocaster is like the Rolls-Royce," said Dick Dale, 53,
known as "king of the surf guitar" for pioneering the surf rock sound in
Southern California in the late-1950s and early '60s. "It can never be
surpassed."  </TEXT>

   DALLAS -- Visitors to the Mandolin Brothers' booth at the
recent Greater Southwest Guitar Show found an eye-popping
price tag hanging from one instrument. "OK, so it's
$100,000," read a sign the Staten Island, N.Y., dealer had
placed nearby. "Go find another one."
   That would be hard to do. The rare 1958 Gibson "Flying V"
was one of only 81 shipped the year it was built. Amid a
recession that has driven down prices for Impressionist
paintings and folk art as well as many collectibles, vintage
guitars are hot -- especially those used by vintage rock 'n'
roll stars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a London auction last year, Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
sold a 1968 Fender Stratocaster used at Woodstock by Jimi
Hendrix for $334,000 -- nearly four times the expected price.
And actor Gary Busey, who portrayed Buddy Holly in a movie,
recently paid $242,000 at a Sotheby's auction in this country
for a 1945 Gibson J-45 acoustic once owned by the late
rocker.
   In 1989, an unidentified buyer even paid $1,300 for a
fragment of a guitar smashed by rock guitarist Pete Townshend
of the Who. "The guitar market has gone berserk," says
Nashville guitar dealer George Gruhn, also a columnist for
Guitar Player magazine.
   Some industry publications have begun tracking prices
monthly, and major manufacturers such as Gibson Guitar Corp.
of Nashville and Fender Musical Instruments Corp. of Brea,
Calif., are building high-priced "reissues" of their own
classics. Gibson's 1959 Les Paul reissues, named for the
legendary guitarist who originally designed the model, sell
for as much as $4,199, compared with about $1,699 for a
similar new model.
   The original pre-1960 Gibson Les Paul models regularly
sell for more than $20,000. And rare prewar Martin D-45
acoustics are going for as much as $50,000 -- nearly
quintuple the top price of just five years ago. Still, these
prices don't come near the cost of a Stradivarius; one of the
violins sold for $1.7 million in London last November.
   The vintage guitar boom is being spurred on, in part, by
aging baby boomers seeking to recapture a piece of their
past. "We've got money to spend, and guitars, banjos and
fretted instruments are the instruments of our youth," says
Kerry Keane, a musical instrument appraiser for Skinner Inc.,
an auction house based in Bolton, Mass.
   As with most collecting fads, though, fortune hunters
should beware. Like cars, most used guitars still sell for
far less than they cost new, and dealers -- who pay top
dollar only for mint-condition guitars -- complain that many
would-be sellers expect any battered instruments they drag in
to be worth a small fortune.
   Moreover, with prices skyrocketing, guitar counterfeiters
are altering serial numbers and name plates, modifying
cheaper models, and even making pseudovintage instruments
from scratch. Some dealers now dismantle instruments before
buying to check for original paint, wiring and hardware.
"There is no such thing as a perfect forgery," says Mandolin
Brothers President Stanley Jay.
   As in so many other collecting areas, prices of vintage
guitars are being driven up by free-spending foreign
collectors and dealers. Many of them are Japanese, who prize
the American-made instruments for their tone, craftsmanship
and continuing status as the choice of most international
recording artists.
   Many U.S. guitar dealers send their inventory lists
directly to foreign collectors and dealers, despite grumbling
from some musicians and dealers about the number of vintage
instruments leaving this country. While industry figures are
hard to come by in a largely cash-and-carry business, some
dealers say foreign buyers account for as much as 75% of
their vintage sales.
   Overseas buyers have even hired U.S. "brokers" to scour
pawnshops and newspaper want ads. "They're out in the
heartland looking for these guitars," says Mark Pollack, of
Charley's Guitar Shop here.
   High-bidding Japanese buyers have become fixtures at the
growing number of guitar shows, which is why Mr. Pollack made
sure he had a Japanese-speaking employee in his booth at the
recent Dallas show, the largest of its kind. Japanese
investors have been known to buy instruments by the truckload
for shipment back to their country, where even mass-produced
workhorses like 1970s-vintage Fender Stratocasters are
selling for as much as $2,500 -- nearly three times the U.S.
price.
   "Mostly, it's the sound," says collector Mac Yasuda of
Newport Beach, Calif., an executive with Tsumura &amp; Co., a
large Tokyo-based manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and bath
additives. With the help of a toll-free U.S. telephone
number, Mr. Yasuda buys instruments for both himself and
company President Akira Tsumura, who recently opened a Tokyo
museum to display his huge collection. Mr. Yasuda's own
collection includes 50 Gibson J-200 acoustic guitars, 15
vintage Gibson Les Pauls, and seven out of the 91 D-45
acoustics made by C.F. Martin Co. of Nazareth, Pa., before
World War II.
   A variety of factors make some guitars worth more than
others. Rarities such as the prewar D-45s -- first made for
cowboy crooner Gene Autry -- and the elegant jazz guitars
handmade by the late John D'Angelico have long been prized
for their tone and craftsmanship.
   Collectors seek out certain early Les Paul models because
of the "flame" patterns in the curly maple wood used to make
them. And the Fender Stratocasters' mystique is due largely
to their use by rock stars such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric
Clapton.
   Meanwhile, a small but growing nostalgia market has
developed for some instruments that never had much snob
appeal. Dealers say baby boomers, apparently recalling the
first budget-priced instruments that their parents bought
them, are paying as much as $1,000 for Danelectro electric
guitars once sold in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. catalogs for $59
and up.
   Dominick Montuoro, a disabled New Rochelle, N.Y.,
construction worker, began collecting them after playing one
that belonged to a friend's son. "I just fell in love with
it," says Mr. Montuoro, who now has 90 of the homely
instruments, which feature Masonite tops with pickups, a
piece of electronic hardware, made from modified lipstick
tubes.
   With prices for many vintage guitars rising and falling on
such quirky factors as which model certain rockers used on
their last tour, appraisers caution that vintage guitars are
not for investors seeking huge profits. "For the most part,
it's a slow, steady increase," says Mr. Keane, the instrument
appraiser.
   Moreover, veteran dealers like Mr. Gruhn of Nashville warn
that prices could plummet if economic troubles beset Europe
or Japan. "If anything happens to reduce foreign demand, this
market will react as though it were struck in the solar
plexis," he says.
   Some professional musicians wouldn't mind seeing that
happen. "It's outrageous," says Warner Brothers recording
artist Ry Cooder, who attended one guitar show a few years
ago, but "crawled out" when he saw the prices. To musicians,
a guitar is a tool, says Mr. Cooder, adding that "a carpenter
wouldn't pay $100 for a hammer."

<HEAD>Guitar Great Les Paul Still Plucks The Strings at 73</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Les Paul sat on a stool at a basement jazz club
on the Lower East Side, the fingers of his left hand cascading down
the neck of his guitar in soft, precise steps.
   At 73, the greatness of his guitar still draws laughs, sighs and
applause from audiences at Fat Tuesday's.
   For the past four years he and his three-piece group have been
playing clubs, performing the same mellow standards Paul has done
for decades. Some of them _ ``Via Con Dios,'' ``How High the Moon''
_ were songs made famous during his long partnership with his
ex-wife, the late singer Mary Ford, from whom he was divorced in
1962.
   Younger musical stars such as Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, Dire
Strait's Mark Knopfler and Dutch guitarist Eddie Van Halen come to
pay tribute and sit in with a musician who did it first and who
many believe still does it best.
   ``In my lifetime, the guitar hasn't changed enough to put in
your hat,'' Paul said, picking an imaginary guitar. ``Whether
you're Segovia or Van Halen, you can't do anything unless you can
do it here.''
   Paul, a musician-composer-designer-inventor, is the acknowledged
father of electronic music. In 1937, he became the first major
artist to play electric guitar when the 65 members of Fred Waring's
Pennsylvanians big band voted unanimously to let Paul play his
amplified contraption.
   ``Suddenly it was recognized that power was a very important
part of music,'' he said in an interview. ``To have the dynamics,
to have the way of expressing yourself beyond the normal limits of
an unamplified instrument, was incredible. Today a guy wouldn't
think of singing a song on a stage without a microphone and a sound
system.
   ``But today, there are a lot of parents who blame Les Paul for
all the racket going on in their basement,'' he said with a smile,
a reference to the thousands of teen-agers whose love affair with
the guitar is expressed in decibels.
   For seven years in the 1950s, Paul and Ford broadcast a TV show
from their home in Mahwah, N.J., which the Listerine Co. _ sponsor
of the show _ bought for the couple to get them to move to New
Jersey from California.
   It was with Ford that Paul developed two-track recording, known
today as dubbing, a process that revolutionized recording in the
'40s and is the backbone of studio work today.
   The guitar that bears his name, the Les Paul, is a legend in its
own right made by the Gibson Co. of Nashville. The list of rock and
fusion jazz musicians who choose to play it reads like a who's who
of modern popular music: blues master B.B. King, Pete Townsend of
The Who, Steve Howe of Yes, jazz great Al DiMeola, Led Zeppelin's
Page and Paul McCartney, who with Paul's help designed his own
custom version of the guitar.
   In turn, two generations of aspiring guitarists have saved their
money for Les Pauls. The most popular model today sells for between
$800 and $900.
   It is the Les Pauls' bigger, ``fatter'' sound that attracted
musicians back in the late '50s, when the first of the classically
inspired guitars was produced. The Les Pauls' innovation was the
use of two, double-coiled pick-ups that reduced the twang of other
guitars and gave the musician a broader range of sounds as the
change the tone or volume on each pick-up.
   Paul Jernigan, Gibson's marketing director, said sales figures
for the guitar are kept confidential but the 12 Les Paul models
continue to grow in popularity and the company now has six months
worth of back orders.
   The instrument's main competition for nearly two decades has
been the Fender Stratocaster, a lighter guitar with a dramatic
molded body. The Stratocaster, or Strat, as it is commonly known,
has its own claim on guitar aristocracy: Jimi Hendrix played a
Strat (and burned several on stage); Eric Clapton and Robin Trower
both prefer the Fenders.
   Ironically, Paul said, most kids these days know what a Les Paul
is, but not who he is. He also has mixed feelings about today's
rock 'n' roll and the way his guitar is now being used. He hates
distortion and electronic gimmicks. ``They're just ways of hiding
what the guitarist can't do with these,'' he said, wiggling his
fingers.
   ``The first rock stuff, I mean in the early '60s, it was bad _
bad singers, bad players, bad everything. But they went from three
chords on guitar and by 1988 we now have some fantastic musicians
in all fields. There are some kids who can go into a music store
and pick up a guitar today and play anything; it's shocking.''
   But one thing Paul has not done is stop learning.
   Gibson has agreed to market a ``super-guitar'' he is now
designing, which he said would sell for nearly $35,000. He also is
expecting a visit from McCartney at Fat Tuesday's for a
performance, though a date has not been set.
   ``You can do anything in music as long as you can think it up,''
he said. ``That's a very exciting thing.''

   Life imitated art at an auction Saturday when
actor Gary Busey, who played Buddy Holly in a film biography, paid
$242,000 for an acoustic guitar owned by the late rock 'n' roll
pioneer.
   In addition to the 1945 Gibson guitar with a cover hand-tooled
by Holly himself, the 118 lots in the Holly sale included a Fender
Stratocaster guitar which netted $110,000 and a pair of the
rocker's trademark black-rimmed glasses which went for $45,100.
   The sale brought in a total of $703,615, said Laura Stewart,
spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction house.
   The proceeds will go to Holly's family, including his widow,
Maria Elena Holly, and his brother, Larry Holley of Lubbock, Texas,
Stewart said. The two were among the 200 people attending the
auction.
   Busey, who bid by telephone, was widely acclaimed for his 1978
portrayal of the bespectacled rocker in ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
His winning bid was more than six times the pre-sale estimate of
$35,000.
   The acoustic guitar, covered with four-color leather, has the
words ``Buddy Holly,'' ``Love Me'' and ``Blue Days, Black Nights''
hand-tooled across the top and ``Texas'' hand-tooled across the
bottom.
   Holly's Stratocaster electric guitar attracted nearly double its
pre-sale estimate of $60,000, and was purchased by an unidentified
bidder. Holly was playing the guitar on the ill-fated tour which
ended with his death.
   The black-rimmed glasses, which Holly wore at the end of his
career, sold for $45,100 to the Hard Rock Cafe, Stewart said. The
late John Lennon, another rocker who wore glasses, once said of
Holly's shades, ``He made it O.K. to wear glasses. I was Buddy
Holly.''
   Another prominent buyer _ Pat DiNizio, lead singer of the
Smithereens _ paid $14,300 for a reel-to-reel tape recorder and
microphone which Holly used to compose new songs.
   Holly burst into prominence in 1957, reeling off a string of
hits like ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``That'll Be The Day,''
``Maybe Baby,'' and ``Not Fade Away.'' Holly, along with J.P. ``The
Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens, died in a Feb. 3, 1959,
plane crash when he was 23.
   ``This memorabilia from the personal collection of Buddy Holly
provides a fascinating glimpse of the singer's boyhood and brief
years of stardom,'' Sotheby's said in its auction catalogue.
   The items date back to when Holly was 11 years old. Included
were family photographs, Holly's harmonica and camera, a business
card from his first band ``Buddy &amp; Bob,'' his personal collection
of 45s and home movies from Christmas 1958.
   There was also one particularly eerie item: a 1956 Equitable
Life insurance policy on Holly, with his parents named as
beneficiaries. This included a handwritten receipt signed by Holly.

   Every other month, cemetery workers tending Jimi
Hendrix's grave replace the lawn worn away by fans.
   Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite
marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks.
   Twenty years after Woodstock _ and 19 years after Hendrix _
admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped
define psychedelic rock.
   When Hendrix cranked up his Fender Stratocaster, the Earth
became ``The Third Stone From the Sun,'' and a nation of rebellious
youth grooved to ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   When he hit Woodstock in August 1969, his music and his career
were soaring. A year and a month later they crashed.
   He died in his sleep Sept. 18, 1970, while on a European tour.
The coroner's report said he choked on his own vomit. The trace of
barbituates in his blood was small, not enough to kill, the coroner
said.
   Hendrix was born in Seattle in 1942. He left Garfield High
School after his junior year to join the Army because he didn't
want to spend another summer mowing the lawns for his father's
landscape business.
   ``He wanted one of those screaming eagles on his shoulder,''
said James A. ``Al'' Hendrix, referring to the patch worn by
paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division.
   Hendrix served after Korea and before Vietnam, when lyrics from
his songs would be scribbled on soldiers' helmets.
   He went by Jimmy in those days and was shy, his father said. The
shortened name and stage antics, such as squirting lighter fluid on
his burning guitar, were just show business he adopted later.
   ``He was a good boy,'' the 70-year-old Hendrix said. ``He played
Little League, football, swimming. We called him `Buster' 'til he
was 9 or 10. Then he wanted to be called Jimmy.''
   Jimmy and his younger brother, Leon, were raised by their
father. His parents were divorced and his mother died when he was
10.
   The family's console record player filled the rooming house
where they lived with B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and young Jimmy
mimicked the records, using a broom for a guitar.
   ``I had this old ukelele from one of my jobs,'' said his father,
a former musician in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``I gave it to
him. Of course he couldn't get much music out of it.''
   So Al Hendrix paid a friend $5 for his acoustic guitar and gave
it to Jimmy. The first electric guitar was bought at a music shop
along with a saxophone for dad. When they fell behind on payments,
the sax went back, but the electric guitar stayed.
   ``I told him he'd go farther with that guitar than I would with
the sax,'' Hendrix said with a laugh. ``I never did get him an amp.
He used to plug into his friends'. Still, he got music out of it.
The Peter Gunn theme was one of the first things I remember him
playing.''
   Hendrix didn't return to Seattle when a back injury from a
parachute jump ended his military career. Instead, he headed East
in search of the music scene, and played in backup bands for the
Supremes, the Isley Brothers and Little Richard.
   Hendrix's guitar playing attracted a record producer who took
him to England. He became ``Jimi.'' Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding
were added to make the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
   The band conquered Europe, and played at the Monterey Pop
Festival in 1967, which led to a record contract and a tour with
the Monkees, the made-for-television pop group. Predictably, the
music styles clashed and the tour was cut short. By August 1969,
the Experience was finished but Hendrix's music was taking off. He
formed the short-lived Band of Gypsies with Buddy Miles and Billy
Cox, whom he'd met in the Army.
   Hendrix left behind a rich musical legacy, influencing a
generation of musicians such as Prince and Eric Clapton. His
records still are among the best sellers at many stores. The heart
of his discography remains ``Are You Experienced?,'' ``Axis: Bold
as Love'' and ``Electric Ladyland.''
   Seattle has been slow to honor Hendrix, partly because his
reputation for drugs and sex didn't seem exemplary for young
citizens. Garfield High School put his bust in the second-floor
library and, when city fathers balked at a plaque in a city park,
the British director of Seattle's zoo volunteered a spot.
   Today, visitors must stand on the Jimi Hendrix memoril rocks for
the best view of the giraffes, zebras and gazelles in the zoo's
African savanna exhibit.
   A bronze sunburst marks the spot, and a sign in the shrubs
nearby reads: ``There's no telling how many lives your spirit will
go through _ die and be reborn.'' _ Jimi Hendrix.

   Danny Ransom spent the first six months of
his career tediously making deformed electric guitars for $10 each.
   Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of
art, that sell for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that
includes some of the world's best-known musicians.
   The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one
guitar body and a dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a
craftsman such as Ransom spends several days, sometimes weeks, on a
single instrument.
   ``These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, `We
build the most perfect machine in the world,' and most of their
stuff is junk,'' he says. ``I've had to make sure every instrument
is right.''
   Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-building business 13 years. He
has built guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and
Alabama. Laurie Anderson and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer
violins he made for a company called Zeta.
   Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's
Stratocaster-style guitars last year from a friend. He says Ransom
understands the complexities of the instrument and how the different
parts interact.
   ``He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most
guitar makers,'' Kaiser said. ``It's just a versatile, expressive
instrument.''
   An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-filled
studio adjacent to ``Real Guitars,'' a collector's guitar store.
   There was a time when he was low man on the guitar-maker totem
pole. He first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now
defunct, initially building what he calls ``the worst garbage.''
   Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff builders had a
habit of taking LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) on the job and
``talking to the tools.''
   ``The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was
brought in,'' Ransom recalls. ``They stuck me in a room with a bunch
of tools, handed me a guitar and said, `Make these.'''
   His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping
$10 each. They were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out.
   One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first
time he'd completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The
final touches required a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided
to show him how it was done.
   ``At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals
burning on it,'' Ransom recalls. ``I said, `Do you know what you're
doing?' He said, `Shut up, of course I do.' Then the glue line
started to lift off and the thing burst into flames right in front
of us.
   ``If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. ...
This is like watching your child burn.''
   Things started to pick up after other builders began teaching
him. Ransom says the difference between a good guitar and a bad
guitar lies in the details, such as the curves in the wood and
placement of the finger board and joints.
   ``There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail.
The better you can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get
at whatever you do in terms of craft. That's really what I got from
some of the people who helped me early on.''
   His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made
mostly from alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards
armed with density and moisture meters to find the right wood. Soft
woods, such as mahogony, tend to give off more mid-range sound while
harder woods, such as poplar, produce the higher, treble sounds. He
has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash
from Louisiana.
   Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, bandsaws
them out, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on
a pinrouter. Last, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows
and bellys are cut by hand.
   As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s,
Ransom had planned to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his
experience working with wood was building matchstick holders and
other ``goofy little things'' when he was a Cub Scout.
   Although he is an admitted `Deadhead' _ Grateful Dead fan _
Ransom is not much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset
than a liability for an electric guitar and violin maker.
   ``The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but
aren't players tend to be much more versatile in their building and
are much more involved in the quality of their instrument, not just
the sound or the playability, but the overall quality.''

   Minutes after mesmerizing an audience with
his electric guitar wizardry, rocker Eric Johnson is shyly greeting
fans and signing autographs.
   He talks with such humility and kindness that it's a tossup
which is more enchanting: the music he makes on stage or his boyish
friendliness backstage.
   Underneath the good humor lies a demanding perfectionism in a
musician on a quest for a brand-new sound from his '54 Fender
Stratocaster.
   ``The older I get, the more I listen to the guitar and go: `Oh
God. I need a new turn-on. It's got to do something more. Is this
all?''' Johnson said in an interview. ``You can get a screechy,
nervous, jittery sound out of the electric guitar and it's like,
gah, it's got to go farther now.
   ``I'm trying to figure out a way. I want it to be real
rocked-out-and-buzz guitar, but I want it to have a little elegance
to it. And in its real Neanderthal, paleolithic way, I want it to
have a tuxedo on.''
   Elegance isn't a word often tied to the electric guitar. But
Johnson was schooled in classical piano and he's found ways to
bring the two together.
   ``I try to listen to more classical music because of the chord
changes and the breadth of the music. To me, classical in a way is
the most unassuming music,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson, 35, first hit the Austin music scene in the 1970s at
age 15, mystifying musicians with his electric guitar mastery that
evoked images of rock revolutionary Jimi Hendrix.
   The late Stevie Ray Vaughan was among those awed by his talent.
Vaughan once said that by the time Johnson reached his late teens,
he was so advanced it was difficult for him to find musicians to
keep up with him.
   Johnson's solo debut album, ``Tones,'' earned him a 1986 Grammy
nomination for ``Best Instrumental of the Year'' for the track
``Zap.'' However, the album had little commercial success.
   Nearly four years later, Johnson has poured his heart and
experience into a new album, ``Ah Via Musicom'' on Capitol Records.
The album and its rich instrumental ``Cliffs of Dover'' have
received favorable response and substantial play on album-only rock
radio stations.
   Johnson said the album has changed his audiences from the
musicians-only crowd to the fickle radio listeners eternally
searching for a new sound and new star.
   Some of the credit must go to Capitol Records, which has heavily
promoted the album, Johnson said.
   But the album also is the embodiment of what makes Johnson
great, his tireless perfectionism and insatiable search for a
different sound.
   ``I spent two months solid working on `Tones.' I spent 15 months
on this last record, not solid but close to it. I just did it over
and over and over, trying to figure out a way to get the guitar
tone like I wanted it,'' he said.
   According to Capitol Records, Johnson recorded ``Ah Via
Musicom'' three times with two bass players, Kyle Brock and Roscoe
Beck; three drummer-percussionists, Tommy Taylor, James Ferner and
Paul Bissell; and several arrangements.
   Brock, who has played with Johnson 20 years, and Taylor,
formerly a drummer for Christopher Cross, are traveling with
Johnson. The three joined rock guitarist Joe Satriani in California
in late September for three weeks of concerts on the West Coast.
   ``I like to think Eric's music is the music we're all involved
in,'' Taylor said. ``It's something a little promising and offers a
little alternative. So much of the music you hear is very
predictable. There's a freshness about what Eric does.''
   What Johnson eternally seeks from his guitar and amplifiers and
electronic gizmos is what musician's call ``tone.''
   ``Tone is the colors you put together to create a certain hue of
sound of a particular instrument - the way you play the instrument,
the emotion you put behind it, the technique, phrasing, all the
things that are elements of your art or your music that create a
sound,'' he said.
   Johnson chooses to search for tone with more conventional
amplifiers and foot pedals from the '60s and '70s that lack the
computer chips found in today's equipment.
   In his live performances, he spreads a buffet of pedals before
his feet. While his fingers dance over the frets of his guitar, his
feet skip between the pedals, producing an energetic, intellectual
sound.
   ``There's kind of this side of me that treats it (the music)
like a laboratory where I work in the studio or I work in my
practice house and fiddle with all sorts of electronics and stuff,
trying to make the guitar sound better,'' Johnson said.
   ``I don't mean that with a negative connotation, but you play
for 20 years and it's the same old guitar sound. At this point, I'm
not reinventing the guitar, I don't have a whole new sound or
anything, but I'm trying to figure out a way to hone and perfect
the electrical guitar sound.''

   Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But
he's spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture
guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations.
   ``It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage
concerts devoted to his music,'' Voss said recently. ``We get the
14-year-olds and the 34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem
to know who Jimi Hendrix was.
   ``There's sort of a gap there _ part of a generation apparently
doesn't realize what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed
today.''
   Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the
acid rocker who used his teeth on the guitar strings in an
unsettling, feedback-laden rendition of the national anthem at the
Woodstock music festival.
   A former music journalist, Voss is founder of the Jimi Hendrix
Information Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum
of the star's memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter
titled ``Voodoo Child,'' a name taken from a Hendrix hit.
   He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the
Seattle-born Hendrix since his drug-related death in a British
ambulance Sept. 18, 1970.
   ``As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20
hours a week on Jimi Hendrix,'' Voss, 38, said in a telephone
interview from his Des Plaines home.
   The newsletter has about 1,500 subscribers, including one fan in
the Soviet Union who has heard only bootlegged recordings of such
Hendrix selections as ``Foxy Lady'' and ``Purple Haze.''
   A recent edition lists the latest appearances of former members
of Hendrix's various backup bands and the going prices for Hendrix
memorabilia, ranging from $4 for a mass-printed poster to $4,495
for a framed and autographed color photograph of the musician.
   ``I've also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by
Hendrix, but I don't dare exhibit that because it's worth from
$15,000 to $25,000,'' Voss said.
   ``That particular model of electric guitar from those years (a
Fender Stratocaster) would bring $2,500 in its own right now, but
the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that Jimi touched
it.''
   Hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years. That's
when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance,
douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar
lying in feedback-shrieking flames.
   ``I don't know how many guitars Jimi destroyed, but I do know
that his road men would salvage the parts and try to reassemble new
guitars from the pieces,'' Voss said.
   When Voss takes his mobile museum to nightclubs, concert halls
and college campuses around the Midwest, he notices many visitors
staring at one exhibit _ a copy of Hendrix' death certificate,
which ends with the words: ``Insufficient evidence of circumstances
_ open verdict.''
   ``Too many people these days only know Hendrix as a `victim' of
drugs, they don't know about his genius as a musician,'' Voss said.
   ``The fact is that although his death was drug-related, Jimi
Hendrix did not die of an overdose. He was not even known among the
musicians of his day as a particularly heavy drug user _ although I
must admit that drug use was more widely tolerated then than it
would be now.''

<P>
In fact, he played it the next year on the Byrds' first hit record. 
</P>
<P>
Long since out of fashion, Rickenbackers are suddenly the rage again. With a 
reputation for expensive quality -- a sort of guitar version of the BMW -- 
they're big with yuppies and with foreign buyers these days. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Beatles, Rickenbacker was just another guitar maker with an unlikely 
home in conservative Orange County. The company -- once an innovator -- became 
too conservative, even stodgy, some critics say. Rickenbacker, they contend, 
wasn't adroit enough to adapt to changes in taste and technology in the 1970s 
and the invasion of foreign-made instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Rickenbacker didn't really seem to care about selling a million guitars or 
becoming a giant like Fender or Gibson, so it has maintained its reputation for 
quality. And, unlike other U.S. guitar makers, it has refused to move its 
manufacturing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
After making guitars for nearly 60 years, Rickenbacker has yet to hit sales of 
$10 million a year, or about what three busy T.G.I. Friday-type restaurants 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
Now the nondescript factory in Santa Ana is swamped with orders for the first 
time since the 1960s, and Rickenbacker is wrestling with problems it hasn't had 
since then: How to make all those guitars without getting sloppy and tarnishing 
its reputation as a small, quality manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
The people who buy Rickenbackers may be dentists and lawyers now, but they were 
adolescents in the 1960s when the Beatles, the Byrds and the Who played 
Rickenbackers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the British rock groups in the '60s used them, and nostalgia's a big 
part of their appeal now," said Richard R. Smith, a guitar collector and author 
of Rickenbacker's official history. 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' sound is so distinct that guitar players can often instantly 
identify one on a record. And even non-experts know there's something different 
about the sharp, scratchy guitar on the first few seconds of the Beatles' 
"Ticket to Ride," or the 12-string guitar that sounds like chimes on the Byrds' 
first hit, "Mr. Tambourine Man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convinced Guitar Was a Fad 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' unusually high, clear, jangly tone also makes them popular now 
with younger bands evoking a 1960s sound. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph Rickenbacker was a Swiss immigrant who patented the first solid-body 
electric guitar in 1935, the forerunner of today's electric guitars. The 
company was named to capitalize on the fame of World War I flying ace Eddie 
Rickenbacker, said to be a distant relative. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Adolph Rickenbacker was ready to retire, he was convinced the 
electric guitar was a fad. He sold the company in 1953 to F. C. Hall, a 
distributor of radio parts who moved it from Los Angeles to be near his home in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, when an obscure young British rocker named John Lennon 
bought one, Rickenbacker was almost as well-known for its older Hawaiian 
guitars, which were played on the guitarist's lap. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Beatles came along, we went from selling thousands of guitars a year 
to tens of thousands," said John Hall, 38, son of F. C. Hall and now 
Rickenbacker's president. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beatles," said Hall, "put the company on the map." 
</P>
<P>
The guitars sold well even though they cost more than $300, by no means cheap 
then. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of the 1960s, the first Rickenbacker boom was over. The Beatles 
had broken up, and most rock had assumed a bluesier, grittier sound. Guitar 
players emerged from anonymity, and every kid wanted the same kind of guitar 
his idol played, or at least one that looked like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried 'Dirtier Sound' 
</P>
<P>
The new stars of the guitar -- such as Eric Clapton -- usually played a Gibson 
Les Paul, which could get the rougher sound. 
</P>
<P>
With Fender's Stratocaster -- played by another innovative musician, Jimi 
Hendrix -- Gibsons were guitars to have in the 1970s. Their sales soared; 
Rickenbacker sales went off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
The company tried to change the guitars, but it was never really able to. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to put in a dirtier sound," said Hall, who bought the company from 
his father four years ago. "It didn't really work." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, things weren't going too well for the rest of the U.S. guitar 
industry, either. Sales of electric and "folk" guitars and other fretted 
instruments had jumped from 400,000 in 1960 -- before folk music and rock hit 
it big -- to 2.5 million in 1972. But the manufacturers would never again sell 
that many. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Well, the baby boomers started to age, and there were fewer teen-agers to 
buy guitars. The late 1970s were rather directionless musically; sales of 
records also suffered. By the 1980s, video games and other distractions 
competed for kids' attention. By 1987, the latest available figures, sales of 
new guitars had dipped to 1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the boom over, but first the Japanese and then the Koreans had 
ridden it right into the U.S. guitar market. 
</P>
<P>
Now guitars manufactured abroad dominate what was once an industry as unique to 
the United States as rock 'n' roll. Of the 1.2 million fretted instruments sold 
last year in the United States, just 123,000 were made in America. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the bigger and more prestigious U.S. companies have moved much of 
their manufacturing offshore to cut costs. Fender, for instance, now makes 40% 
of its guitars abroad, and once quit manufacturing in the United States 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unknowledgeable Executives 
</P>
<P>
Some legendary names in the guitar business got hurt by imports, weak 
management and bad moves. Most had been bought by bigger companies dazzled by 
the glamour of the business. The cash that the new parent companies brought to 
the table sometimes helped soften the blow from imports. But, some critics say, 
the new owners often didn't know much about the business and hadn't the 
faintest idea how to compete with the imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them had a succession of executives who didn't know how to tune a 
guitar," said George Gruhn, a Nashville dealer in vintage guitars who has 
written extensively about the industry. "The Japanese often showed a better 
knowledge of the American market than the Americans did." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for instance, all guitar manufacturers foreign and domestic shipped 
only $328 million worth of guitars at retail in the United States. By contrast, 
computer makers shipped $3.9 billion worth of home computers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Looks 
</P>
<P>
Rickenbacker is small even by the standards of this matchbox-sized industry. 
What saved the company in the 1970s was its basses. As the guitars became 
unfashionable, the basses just as suddenly became hip. They were prized for 
their own bright, clear sound. It lifted the instrument out of the rhythm 
section in some groups -- such as the art rock combo Yes, whose bassist played 
a Rickenbacker -- and made the bass another solo instrument. 
</P>
<P>
When the guitars began to come back a few years ago, it wasn't terribly 
surprising that they still looked pretty much the same as they did 25 years 
ago, since a large part of their appeal is based on nostalgia. And they still 
make the same limited -- though distinct -- range of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia is not cheap: A new Rickenbacker starts at around $500 and goes up to 
$2,700. That's without an amplifier or a case, both essential to the complete 
rock 'n' roller. And it's by no means the most expensive guitar these days. 
</P>
<P>
A Jackson -- a rakish semi-custom guitar often painted in garish reds or blues 
-- starts at $1,500 and goes up to $3,000. It's the guitar of choice for heavy 
metal bands these days. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the heavy metal types, a Rickenbacker is quieter and often older 
professional rockers who tend to play Rickenbackers, such as Tom Petty and 
Jackson Browne. Some newer groups are playing them too, including REM and the 
Bangles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's on MTV? It's Hot 
</P>
<P>
But the guitar market is fickle. Doc Pittillo, a Costa Mesa guitar repairman, 
said, "What's really hot is usually what the kids saw on MTV last week. That's 
why I'm in business." 
</P>
<P>
What happens when the Rickenbacker fad wanes again, as some experts say it 
surely must? 
</P>
<P>
The younger Hall seems more willing to change with the times, to some extent. A 
guitar player, unlike his father, and a friend to some of his more renowned 
customers like McGuinn, Hall has mostly tinkered with a few changes in the 
company's marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Of new models, however, there are few, and critics say the company could get 
caught flat-footed when fashion and technology change again. The last new 
guitars came out four years ago and aren't selling particularly well compared 
to the more classic models because -- in a classic Catch 22 -- the new models 
"don't look like Rickenbackers," said Hall. The company is working on some new 
guitars it will unveil this year. 
</P>
<P>
In marketing its guitars, Rickenbacker has finally deigned to use one of the 
oldest ploys in the guitar industry: Get a famous guitar player to endorse your 
product. But Rickenbacker's pitch is still largely nostalgic: Its deals are 
with older rockers such as the Byrds' McGuinn and Pete Townshend of the Who. 
Rickenbacker is selling new models of the guitars McGuinn and Townshend played 
in the 1960s and making them only in limited editions so it can charge more. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also taken to sticking "Made in America" labels on its guitars. 
That's mostly for foreign buyers. It doesn't really make much difference to the 
U.S. mass market now that guitars from abroad are as good as most U.S. guitars. 
The international market is important to Rickenbacker: Almost half the 10,000 
guitars the company says it usually makes each year are sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a plan to manufacture better and more expensive amplifiers, which 
the company has been making for an indifferent public for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Rickenbacker still sticks stubbornly to a nondescript section of 
Santa Ana -- almost in the shadow of several sparkling new glass office towers 
-- where it employs 100 to make guitars largely by hand. 
</P>
<P>
There are no plans to make the guitars abroad, and Hall says little will change 
at its tiny plant, where blocks of dull, beige Eastern Rock Maple enter only to 
emerge six weeks later as burnished art objects. "My name's not Rickenbacker," 
said Hall, "but I act like it is."

AUCTION A GOOD GIG FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: VENTURA COUNTY DEPARTMENT IS $102,693.50 RICHER AFTER VINTAGE GUITARS 
SEIZED FROM A DEALER GO UP FOR BID.

The Japanese collector shouted "Eight thousand!" to the auctioneer and Brent 
Haesler knew it was time to quit bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Haesler, an amateur guitarist from Palos Verdes, was prepared to spend up to 
$4,000 for a classic six-string but instead settled for a well-worn 1950 
acoustic that was easily within budget at $300. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this many collectible guitars in one location," said Haesler, 
36, whose modest collection includes a 1957 Gibson Les Paul. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 dealers, collectors and musicians from Washington to Japan 
converged on an Upland auction yard Thursday night to bid on 87 vintage guitars 
seized last year from a Thousand Oaks drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
When the bidding concluded, United Auctions had taken in $112,850, and the 
anti-drug unit of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was $102,693.50 
richer, after deducting a 9% auctioneer's fee. 
</P>
<P>
The collection, which had sat in the storage room for more than a year, was 
officially appraised at $126,000 earlier this week by Mac Yasuda, a renowned 
Japanese guitar collector who bid the $8,000 for a prized 1962 Fender 
Stratocaster, the top price of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda dropped $23,000 on 10 guitars, mostly inexpensive acoustic models that 
he said are better suited for twanging than displaying in the guitar museum he 
plans to open in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"If this auction was in Texas, I definitely would have been outbid on them," 
Yasuda said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies seized the guitars, along with $76,155 in cash and a 1988 
Camaro car, during a September, 1989, raid on the Potrero Road residence of 
William H. Budnik. They reportedly confiscated five pounds of hydroponically 
grown marijuana, hashish, cocaine and psilocybin mushrooms and then claimed the 
guitars, money and car as drug-sale profits. 
</P>
<P>
Budnik argued that he paid legitimate money for the guitars, whose value he 
estimated at about $100,000. He dropped the claim after pleading guilty to 
possession of marijuana for sale and serving several months of a one-year 
sentence in the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was held under an outdoor canopy with a jazz band accompanying 
registered bidders who wanted to test the guitars' sound quality. Haesler said 
some die-hard musicians put down the $500 required to bid with no intention of 
buying, merely for the chance to play some treasured instruments from noon to 
the start of bidding at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Sullivan, 57, of Thousand Oaks, satisfied a longtime desire when he 
walked away with a 1949 Gibson jazz guitar. Sullivan, who works in the 
electronics industry, said he has put off guitar studies for years because he 
lacked a finely crafted instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an affinity for Gibsons since I had one in college that I sold when 
money got tight," Sullivan said. "This scratches a longtime itch." 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda's $8,000 Stratocaster was valued at $10,000. Several of the most 
expensive guitars sold below their appraised values, while many guitars worth 
$200 to $300 netted twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of happy buyers who walked away with bargains," said Bob Mohs, 
the auction company's general manager. "There may be some purchases that people 
will be disappointed about once they come out from under the ether," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Mohs said he has auctioned off private guitar collections in the past but none 
as large or with the no-minimum bid and unrestricted ceiling stipulated by the 
county. The bidders also were among the most shrewd horse-traders Mohs said he 
had ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who came here knew exactly the value of each guitar, when it was 
made and who painted it," Mohs said. "Some even knew who owned a guitar before 
the collector who had it seized from him." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials suspected that Budnik might turn up to reclaim 
some of his most coveted pieces. Auction officials recorded no sales to him, 
but said his bidding might have been done by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Thompson, the Sheriff Department's property custodian, said the former 
owner could only have gone away heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lost a lot," Thompson said. "There are a lot of guitars here he could 
never replace." 
</P>
<P>
Said Doug Moran of United Auctions: "It would be tough for him to show up. Sort 
of like going to your girlfriend's wedding or being the bellhop on her 
honeymoon."

<HEAD>Foxy Legacy: The Lingering Impact of Jimi Hendrix</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SPENCER BRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimi Hendrix is dead and selling jeans in Britain.
   Still selling records, too, 20 years after his death; still
unmatched by all would-be imitators of his furious, blazing mastery
of the electric guitar.
   ``The Hendrix phenomenon has never really gone away,'' says
George McManus, marketing executive at Polydor Records.
   Two decades gone, Hendrix is a briskly moving product. Polydor's
``Cornerstones'' album hit the top five and will shortly go
platinum in Britain. Wrangler adopted ``Crosstown Traffic'' for a
jeans commercial.
   Bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the
survivors of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, each published books this
year.
   ``Jimi's death was the most lucrative act of his sad career,''
according to Redding, whose book is partly a diatribe against the
Hendrix estate.
   The U.S. Army, which counts Hendrix as an alumnus, kicked off
the year by including his ``Voodoo Chile'' as part of its amplified
get-out-of-that-refuge concert in Panama for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The anniversary may be a melancholy event for anyone who
remembers the first ear-boggling encounter with ``Foxy Lady,''
``Manic Depression'' or ``Purple Haze'' - ``'Scuse me, while I kiss
the sky'' - from the ``Are You Experienced?'' LP in 1967.
   Serious craziness was the Hendrix experience: a stoned banshee
swathed in psychedelic foppery, caressing and bullying and
battering his guitar; bending ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' into
weird shapes at Woodstock; amazing the plaster casters; fleeing a
concert in Denver in a cloud of tear gas; taking too many downers
and choking to death on his own vomit.
   Born in Seattle in 1942, Hendrix found fame in Britain, and
Britain is where he died, in his London apartment on Sept. 18,
1970.
   His records have always sold well, but his impact wasn't widely
recognized until the Wrangler jeans company commissioned a survey
into British teen-age musical tastes. Hendrix's name ranked high
alongside living rock stars.
   Wrangler decided to feature Hendrix's ``Crosstown Traffic'' in
what became a highly effective TV commercial. Filmed in New York,
it showed a handsome young taxi driver who dumps his cab in the
middle of Manhattan and takes off to Miami. Wrangler followed up
with another commercial including footage of Hendrix in concert.
   ``His appeal is partly his rebel image and partly his short
life, the James Dean factor,'' Polydor's McManus said. ``But deeper
than that, I believe it is because he is the source of so much of
today's music. People like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard will readily
admit to the debt they owe him. You can hear 20 seconds of a guitar
and know it is Jimi Hendrix. Very few people had that ability.''
   One of the most successful new British bands to cite Hendrix as
an influence is The Stone Roses from the thriving Manchester scene,
whose ``indie dance'' music combines psychedelia with disco-derived
``house'' music.
   Hendrix's influence can be detected on their two recent Top 10
singles, ``One Love'' and ``Fools Gold''
   ``Hendrix is top for me,'' says Stone Roses guitarist John
Squire. ``He was trying to expand peoples' minds in the '60s and
we're trying to do the same thing for the '90s. He had an extrovert
approach which we share. He is one of the few people we can relate
to.''
   The two men most closely related to Hendrix have contrasting
stories to tell.
   Redding, who was sacked from the band, emphasizes financial
matters. His book, ``Are You Experienced?'' is about the millions
of dollars worth of royalties he claims to be owed.
   Mitchell's book, ``The Hendrix Experience,'' is full of pictures
and generally happier.
   Hendrix, according to Mitchell, ``was far from a tragic
character. For one thing, he had a wicked sense of humor. That's
why the women, in particular, really liked him, because we're
talking about a man who was funny.''
   One of Hendrix's secrets as a guitar technician, Mitchell
writes, were his thumbs, ``nearly as long as his fingers.''
   Mitchell also complains about his treatment by the estate, but
he had one lucrative gift from Hendrix: a Fender Stratocaster that
sold for $350,000 at auction in April.
   One important figure who has not written his memoirs is Chas
Chandler, former bass player of The Animals who saw Hendrix in a
Greenwich Village club, brought him to England and formed The Jimi
Hendrix Experience.
   ``I considered writing a book now and again, but I never had the
time, and anyway I enjoy books too much,'' Chandler said in a rare
interview.
   He has returned to his roots in a coastal village in the
northeast of England where he lives with his family and manages a
local rock outfit, The Steve Graham Band.
   Chandler produced the first two Hendrix albums, ``Are You
Experienced?'' and ``Axis: Bold as Love,'' but quit halfway through
``Electric Ladyland,'' frustrated with the hangers-on and endless
rerecording of tracks.
   ``My only obvious regret is I wonder if I didn't walk out maybe
he would still be alive. He is a loss; he was a good friend.
Otherwise, I certainly have no regrets,'' Chandler said.
   ``I do think there is a death cult around Jimi. There is
something black about all this brooding over his death. He is
typified as some sort of brooding genius. But when he was alive he
was a very funny guy, full of laughter. He was quite a gentle lad,
quiet but witty and a good mimic.
   ``You would have thought he went everywhere and burned his
guitar. But he only did it twice.''
   Chandler said that when he met him, Hendrix hadn't written a
song. ``But I knew there was a place in England for him through the
sheer potential of his guitar. The music audiences in England had
become quite sophisticated. ... The Beatles were pushing the
boundaries of what was acceptable and audiences were quite willing
to grasp something that was experimental.''
   Chandler also believes Hendrix's appeal endures because of his
imitators.
   ``Most of the riffs played by a lot of guitar bands have their
origins in Hendrix. He was an originator of sounds, the greatest
guitar player to have lived,'' Chandler said.

<HEAD>Presley's Underpants, Lennon's Suit, Michael Jackson's Hat Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A batch of rock 'n' roll memorabilia featuring
Elvis Presley's underpants and Michael Jackson's stage hat fetched
more than half a million dollars at auction Saturday.
   A lot of Presley's personal items, including a pair of
Munsingwear maroon nylon underpants, an electric razor, hairbrush
and black socks, went for $605, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman
for Sotheby's, the auctioneer.
   A Gibson model J-200 guitar Presley used in the late 1950s and
early '60s sold for $27,500, the top price paid at the auction, Ms.
Stewart said.
   Jackson's autographed fedora was sold for $4,125.
   About 30 bidders and more than 300 spectators gathered to see
226 lots of memorabilia sold for a total of $533,477, Ms. Stewart
said. The T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS
Research received $127,600 of the proceeds, she said.
   Top-priced items included a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
used by Jimi Hendrix that sold for $15,400; Hendrix's silk Neru
jacket with handpainted eyes, face and other psychedelic details
that went for $13,200, and a gold ring of Presley's that attracted
a top bid of $14,300, she said.
   The Elvis Presley Museum in Nashville spent $9,900 for an
autographed bustier worn by Madonna in her music video for ``Gonna
Dress You Up In My Love,'' she said.
   Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics for ``I Want You'' went for
$8,800, a John Lennon gray wool suit fetched $3,300 and one of
Lennon's guitar straps sold for $8,250, she said.
   A pair of high-top white and gray leather sneakers autographed
by Jam Master J and Joseph ``Run'' Simmons of Run DMC sold for
$1,870, she said.
   The sneakers, which brought four times the projected price, were
purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe of New York.
   Hard Rock America, which stocks its 10 restaurants with rock
memorabilia, paid $137,973 for 49 lots, Ms. Stewart said.
   Other items auctioned included a group of Avalon Ballroom
concert posters featuring groups such as Canned Heat, Iron
Butterfly, The Doors and Jefferson Airplane that went for $3,850,
and a set of Huey Lewis' golf clubs that sold for $2,475, Ms.
Stewart said.

musicians, including steel guitarist Alvino Rey, performed at the ceremony to
thank the man who invented the famed Telecaster and Stratocaster guitars
despite being unable to read music or play instruments.;    Mr. Fender's
guitars first were favored by country and western musicians who were persuaded
to try them out in the early 1950s. Some at the service said they owed their
careers to him.;    "He has contributed more to the music industry than any
other individual," said Hank Penny, longtime friend and western band leader.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IT'S HARD to say whether the times had more effect on Robert Cray, or Robert
Cray had more effect on the times -- at least as far as the blues world is
concerned.;    Remember the sensitive '70s, when Alan Alda was the role model
for insecure men who didn't know how to be polite to women who didn't want men
to open doors for them?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE GUILTY BLUES OF ROBERT CRAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     That's when the Robert Cray Band was formed -- in Eugene, Ore., in 1974 --
and over the years Cray has brought something new to the blues: neurotic,
angst-filled guilt.;    The theme was strongly heard on "Strong Persuader,"
his Grammy-winning 1986 album, especially on the hit "Right Next Door (Because
of Me)." That tune is like a zealot whipping himself, a man feeling bad about
breaking up his neighbor's marriage and a family over an extramarital affair.;
   It's heard again on Cray's latest album, "Midnight Stroll," in such tunes
as "My Problem": "I took all the love that I wanted / All I thought I needed /
To satisfy my selfish world." And on "Consequences": "I was smoking and
drinking and thinking when you walked by / The next thing I knew, I was making
up my alibi.";    These kinds of lyrics started showing up in his music, Cray
said during a recent phone interview from the North Bay, where he makes his
home, because he was trying to "figure out why something went wrong in a
relationship -- I do that, and so does everyone else I know who writes a song
-- and because, after a while playing clubs, some of the women yelled 'BS' at
the songs.;    "It's the male fashion (to accept guilt), as compared to the
blues in the past, where it was always the woman's fault -- not to say all the
songs are like that -- but nowadays you can be the one at fault. There's two
sides to every story.";    Cray, 37, also brought his own variation of the
blues sound to his guitar playing. About 1979 he picked up a Fender
Stratocaster with a thin, tinny tone that somehow fits his lyrics better than
the fat, rich sound of the Gibson he'd been playing.;    "I liked the sound,"
Cray said. "I picked one up, liked the way it felt. It's very accessible . . .
one volume control, two tones, easy to get to the (pick-up selection) switch.
Easy to play, fewer frets. Most Gibsons have 22, Strats have 21.";    As many
other blues players were going to a thicker tone -- such as Stevie Ray
Vaughan, who also played a Strat most of the time, but used thicker strings
and even Leslie organ speakers to get a richer sound -- or to a funkier beat,
such as Albert Collins, on his famous Telecaster, Cray continued to develop
his cleaner, cooler sound.;    And he's put it onstage with all of the blues
greats, from John Lee Hooker to Eric Clapton, who once jokingly threatened
Cray in a guitar showdown.;    "He said, 'Watch out, Cray, I'll cut you off at
the knees!' " Cray laughed as he recalled the jest. It happened at London's
Royal Albert Hall during a show that included one of Cray's other guitar
heroes, Buddy Guy, and pianist Johnnie Johnson, one of rock's founding fathers
and greatest players. "Clapton's mostly quiet and laid-back . . . he and Buddy
got into (trading guitar licks) onstage, but nobody's really out there trying
to cut anybody.";    The latest refinement of the Cray sound is the addition
of Memphis Horns, including trumpet player Wayne Jackson and sax player Andrew
Love, who were part of the rhythm-and-blues glory days at Stax records.;   
"They've had a big effect on the style," Cray said. "We're not really changing
the direction" of his rhythm and blues music, "but they changed the groove.
The material we're doing they fall into really good. It kind of broadened the
style of our music.";    Good-looking and tall (a Strat looks very small in
his hands), Cray sang "Brown-Eyed, Handsome Man" in the movie "Chuck Berry:
Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.";    He's made nine music videos in support of his
albums, and a collection of them was recently released to retailers. But Cray
said he feels a little uncomfortable about them.;    "They're fun sometimes,
but the whole thing about doing videos is not the reason we're in the band.
Some people see the videos only, don't see bands live, and that upsets me . .
. and it upsets me that you have to paint a picture of a song.";     Robert

ALBUM DEBUT IMPRESSIVE BY STEVIE SALAS COLORCODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Island Records has just released the debut album by Stevie Salas ColorCode, the 
rock 'n' roll power trio fronted by the Oceanside native. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the album, the 26-year-old guitarist and cohorts C.J. deVillar on 
bass and Winston A. Watson on drums just might steal the show from Joe 
Satriani, for whom they're opening Saturday and Sunday at the California 
Theater downtown. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just an impressive debut, but an impressive album, period. The 10 
songs, all either written or co-written by Salas, are rooted in gut-smacking 
hard rock (borderline heavy metal), but steeped in sweltering funk. This isn't 
really surprising, given that two of the first people Salas worked with after 
moving to Los Angeles in 1985 -- he spent the first half of the decade plying 
the North County bar scene with This Kid's -- were George Clinton and Bootsy 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, in fact, contributes a brief "long-distance telerap" to "Two Bullets 
and a Gun," one of the album's standout tracks. The ingredients are all there: 
a catchy melody, a ferocious beat, and Salas' delirious guitar pyrotechnics. 
Other songs on which Salas' fingers do exceptionally fine gymnastics on the 
frets are the funky, Living Colour-ish "Stand Up!" and "The Harder They Come," 
reminiscent of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way." 
</P>
<P>
That Salas is an incredible guitarist is old news. After all, he spent nearly 
two years on the road with Rod Stewart, playing the immortal licks, riffs, 
solos, and fills originally laid down by Jeff Beck and Ronnie Wood. 
</P>
<P>
The new news is that Salas is also a pretty amazing singer (all the other stuff 
he's done, both on the road and in the studio, involved only his guitar). Salas 
is certainly not your typical androgynous-sounding hard-rock shrieker; his 
voice is rangy and resonant. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed -- he's a veritable vocal chameleon, sounding, at times, like Prince 
("Just Like That"), the late Jimi Hendrix ("Indian Chief"), and even Joe Cocker 
("Over and Over Again"). 
</P>
<P>
Many San Diego acts have been signed to major labels in the last few years, but 
very few have actually succeeded in making a national name for themselves. 
Salas certainly has the talent and the credits to be in this elite minority. 
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Stage Company downtown is now featuring live music every 
Tuesday night. Rick Saxton and partner Rob Flury, working together as Uncle 
Mother Productions, are producing concerts featuring local, original-music acts 
you're not likely to see anywhere else in town. 
</P>
<P>
Past performers include progressive funk-rock band Daddy Longlegs, veteran folk 
singer Sam Hinton, acoustic folk-and-comedy duo the Rugburns, and topical 
singer-songwriter Deborah Liv Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd play the bars if they could, but the bar scene revolves around Top 40 
and discos where people don't come out to hear music, but to have a social 
scene," Saxton said. "Here, the music comes first -- no one's worried about 
booze sales or picking up on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, the Progressive Stage Company -- at 433 G St. -- holds 
just 50 people and doesn't have a liquor license. The cover charge is $5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a concert scene," Saxton said. "The atmosphere we're trying to 
create is completely different than Diego's." 
</P>
<P>
Saxton and Flury initially began producing original-music concerts together 
last summer, at the weekly Underground at the Lyceum in Horton Plaza. Last 
November, they were hired to produce the Progressive Stage Company's Homegrown 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We did all sorts of theater pieces and concerts, and when the festival ended, 
we were asked to continue doing the Tuesday night concerts," Saxton said. 
</P>
<P>
"And the response has been really good, both from the musicians and from the 
crowds. There's so much great talent in San Diego, particularly from the 
songwriter angle, that gets too little exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Progressive Stage Company will host a double bill: Latin-folk band 
Kumara, from Tijuana, and the Transylvania String Quartet, which plays ethnic 
folk music from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego ticket brokers continue to accept "deposits" on choice 
seats for upcoming local concerts that have yet to be booked, much less 
announced -- more than likely, to improve their cash flow. Among the 
speculative shows they advertised in last Thursday's Reader are might-happen, 
might-not-happen appearances by Paul McCartney, the Grateful Dead, and New Kids 
on the Block (Ideal Ticket Agency); Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, and Madonna 
(Atlas Tickets); and Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and U2 (Trip Tickets). . . . 
Surprise guest at last Friday's Afropop Dance Party at the Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa: Zairean soukous superstar Tabu Ley, with seven musicians and dancers. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Richman will be making a solo concert appearance Feb. 11 at the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. Richman is the former leader of the Modern Lovers, a 
quirky New England band from the 1970s whose charter members include Cars 
drummer Dave Robinson and Talking Heads keyboardist Jerry Harrison. . . . 
Soundgarden, the hot new grunge-rock band from Seattle that Spin magazine 
recently predicted "could become the metal band for people who hate metal," 
will be appearing Feb. 16 at Iguanas in Tijuana. The group's drummer, Matt 
Cameron, is from San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Belly Up is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the 
recovery of a black 1964 Fender Stratocaster guitar and a Fender Twin Reverb 
amplifier stolen from the club on Jan. 5. The stuff belongs to Rosie Flores' 
guitarist. . . . Actor-cum-rocker Dennis Quaid's expected one-night stand 
Monday at the Belly Up has turned into a two-nighter. He'll perform Sunday 
night as well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Molly Hatchet on Thursday at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; the Beat Farmers, also Thursday, at the Belly Up; the 
Jesus and Mary Chain and Nine Inch Nails on Friday at the California Theater; 
Nite Soil Man, also Friday, at the Casbah in Middletown; the Pandoras Saturday 
at the Spirit in Bay Park, and Leslie West on Sunday at the Bacchanal.

ELECTRIC GUITAR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  RECORDINGS; Each review is signed at the bottom  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  "Les Paul: The Legend; and the Legacy"; (Capitol; CDs and cassettes);
(star)(star)(star); The role of the electric guitar as the symbolic instrument
of pop is now undeniable. But its rise began at the cusp of the '50s with Les
Paul.;   Paul not only redefined that role -- from a chugging member of the
rhythm section in jazz big bands to a solo instrument -- he provided it with
technical and technological innovations that have now become commonplace. He
designed the now famous "Les Paul" guitar and developed the multi-track
recording process and the echo pedal.;   None of these innovations would have
made much of an impact if he hadn't been such a dazzling guitarist. But he
was. And it is all to be had on this rollicking four-CD boxed set.;   From
such initial sparklers as "Lover" and "Caravan" to such hits as "How High the
Moon" he recorded with Mary Ford, his wife and vocalist, Paul's fleeting
phrasings and his melodic meanderings, all recorded in multi-track mode with
one musical section topping another in layers of sound, are the stuff of pop
history in the making.;   The historical side is documented by Paul himself in
the enclosed booklet with comments by the master on a track-by-track basis.
The scrupulously constructed set also comes with 30 unreleased songs from
Paul's personal vaults and such rare selections as several radio programs and
even the commercials he recorded for Rheingold Beer.;   Much of the material
-- and Ford's warbly vocals -- sound like period pop pieces from the '50s. But
his trebly tones and his acrobatic solos are constantly astounding and remind
us that it was Paul who set the stage for the work of such future guitar
heroes as Jeff Beck. And the sound and the innovations he achieved -- the echo
and the rest -- are the stuff on which all of modern pop is based.; -- Harry
Sumrall; Rock; JEFF BECK; "Beckology"; (Epic/Legacy; CD and cassettes);
(star)(star)(star)(star); Of the reigning triumvirate of Clapton-Beck-Page
that virtually invented the modern concept of rock guitar in the '60s, Jeff
Beck is arguably the most intriguing. While his two counterparts have pursued
somewhat static (if brilliant) creative courses (Clapton in the blues and Page
in heavy metal), Beck has been all over the musical map.;   "Beckology" charts
that course with the same sense of rollicking abandon that has characterized
Beck's career. In the process, it encapsulates some of the wildest, noisiest,
most eccentric, idiosyncratic, wonderful, remarkable, low-down and dirty and
technically breathtaking guitar licks ever committed to record.;   It opens
with three previously unreleased cuts of Beck scratching out the blues with
the Tridents in 1963. Astoundingly, the Beck sound with its whoops and
screeches and fleeting runs was there from the start, particularly on "Nursery
Rhyme.";   From there, the set is a non-stop roller coaster ride through
Beck's revolutionary work with the Yardbirds on such hits as "Heart Full of
Soul" (in which he mimicked a sitar) to the epochal "I'm A Man" that begat
every garage and metal band that has come along since. (The set includes four
songs the group recorded live for the BBC in its heyday in 1965).;   And from
there it is on to selections of his performances with eight (!) versions of
the Jeff Beck Group, collaborations with the Jan Hammer Group and former
Vanilla Fudgers Appice and Bogert and the solo efforts from the past decade.; 
 True to the inspired oddness of its namesake, "Beckology" comes in a box that
is made to look like an old Fender guitar case. (The cover of the enclosed
booklet with its scores of photos and Beck-related anecdotes is a guitar.) It
is, hands down, the best packaging of any of the boxed sets available.;   And
it's perfectly matched by the set's music.;   From the Martian take of Les
Paul on "Jeff's Boogie" to the eloquent interpretation of Charles Mingus'
classic "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" to the grandiose reading of "People Get Ready"
with old mate/nemesis Rod Stewart, "Beckology" proves that Beck has never
stuck with one genre or style. The only constant in his work has been the
uniqueness he has brought to every piece of music he has plucked.; -- H.S.;
JIMI HENDRIX; "Stages"; (Reprise; CDs and cassettes); (star)(star) 1/2; If
Beck and Clapton and Page invented the modern rock guitar, it was Hendrix who
embraced their various innovations and wrapped them up in one all-encompassing
onslaught. The Page metal riffs and the Clapton blues and the Beck noises
became in Hendrix's work a vast new world of sound.;   Much of that world
existed onstage, where he expanded on the sounds and songs of his studio
albums.;   While there are a number of "concert" records and CDs of Hendrix,
"Stages" is different in that it captures that world as it evolved over the
four years of Hendrix's legendary -- if brief -- career.;   Each of the set's
four CDs is drawn from individual shows (1967-1970) and comparisons of those
performances are variously redundant and illuminating. The Stockholm show from
1967 comes with notably straight renditions of the initial Hendrix hits as the
newly formed Experience feels its way through the material.;   The Paris and
San Diego shows (1968, 1969) are much looser, with the interplay between the
guitarist and bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell expanding in
various "psychedelic" directions. And the Atlanta show of 1970 (with bassist
Billy Cox) is a mostly sloppy performance that reveals the boredom that had
set in on Hendrix's part with the sound that had become his signature.;  
Songs such as "Purple Haze" and "Fire" appear on all the discs, with new
slants on each as Hendrix's sound evolved. And there are moments of inspired
spontaneity at various points.;   But none of this is new. Hendrix's volatile
shows have been documented on other records. And his real innovations, most of
which were accomplished in the studio, are obviously not included.;   This is
a set for true fans only. Anyone else who would like a full plate of Hendrix's
career should consult the excellent 1990 set "Lifelines: The Jimi Hendrix
Story," also released by Reprise.; -- H.S.; TEXAS; "Mother's Heaven";
(Mercury; CD and cassette); (star)(star)(star); Don't let the name fool you.
This Scottish dance-pop outfit is about as Texan as a cowboy in a plaid skirt.
Lead singer Sharleen Spiteri has a great big, sultry voice and a bravura,
Annie Lennox-style delivery that really lights up the often-unremarkable
material on the band's second album. The band's booming, epic-scale Euro-soul
melodies will spark comparisons with classic Eurythmics and the dance-floor
ravers Primal Scream. Instrumentally, the group borrows much from the lush,
seamless, keyboard-driven style of Bruce Hornsby. This stuff is an arresting
alternative to the din of hip-hop and house. "Mother's Heaven," "Why Believe
In You" and "Alone With You" are all rock-solid pop singles that deserve to be
played at red-line volume. It would be a pity to see a talent as big as Texas
get lost in the crowd of emerging pop groups.; -- David Plotnikoff  </TEXT>

SURF GUITAR CZAR DICK DALE STILL WEARS THE CROWN AROUND HERE; 
</P>
<P>
HE CAN BE UNEVEN, BUT HIS RAUCOUS PERFORMANCE AT THE COACH HOUSE THURSDAY 
PROVES HE'S STILL ONE OF ORANGE COUNTY'S TRUE MUSICAL GEMS.

<P>
Talking to Dick Dale can sometimes leave one with the impression that, along 
with creating surf music on the first day, the King of the Surf Guitar was also 
responsible for the rest of creation. But for all his proclamations of having 
taught Hendrix how to play, having single-handedly made the unknown sport of 
surfing a national craze, ad infinitum, it's doubtful that Dale seriously 
maintains any notions of deity. 
</P>
<P>
Performing as tremendously as he did at the Coach House on Thursday, though, he 
would be entirely justified in claiming the surf-god throne in any 
self-respecting Valhalla. From the reverberated froth issuing from his aged 
Fender equipment, Dale did indeed form a crashing universe of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Since Dale has been an Orange County staple for decades (he recently moved to 
the desert near Twentynine Palms but still performs here regularly), it's easy 
to take him for granted, particularly when some of his performances are 
godawful. As recently as a few months ago, he turned in a Coach House show that 
was so offhanded and full of dead air that it recalled the Reno-revue-like Dale 
shows of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps playing surf guitar is rather like surfing: Either you're riding atop 
the wave or you're flailing around in the spume. On Thursday, Dale was in 
perfect form, bringing all the power and elemental fury to his guitar playing 
that made him a Southern California sensation 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Palpable might be the best word to describe his guitar work. From his 
machine-gun staccato picking and upside-down left-handed way of playing -- 
making the bass strings particularly handy -- to his super-heavy strings (too 
much for the "puny little fingers" of other players, he recently claimed), 
splashy reverb effects and loud, heavy-duty Fender Showman amps (essentially 
created for Dale's punishing attack), everything in Dale's arsenal aimed toward 
making an overwhelming sound that one could most definitely feel. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing inspiration from the sensation of catching a wave, Dale was a pioneer 
in expanding the vocabulary of the guitar, and his mastery of the instrument 
showed Thursday. Along with the incredible speed and precision of his picking 
(which literally causes his picks to melt), he used his amped-up Stratocaster 
to create amusical sounds -- deep, insane rumbles and high, keening wails 
somewhere between a police siren and a pterodactyl shriek. 
</P>
<P>
Dale performed with his "power trio" version of the Del-Tones, with longtime 
drummer Steve Aschoff and bassist Ron Eglit of Orange County's Gyromatics. The 
pair provided a muscular backing, with the alertness necessary to work with a 
leader who often lurched without notice from one song to another. Dale may have 
performed 29 selections; it was hard to tell with all the seamless segues. 
</P>
<P>
Dale had his long black hair pulled back in a ponytail, avoiding the 
unfortunate Morticia-meets-Uncle-Fester look he's affected at recent 
performances. An audience of old fans, as well as kids who weren't even born 
within 12 years of Dale's first Balboa twangings, crowded to dance in front of 
the stage as he pummelled through such Del-Tone classics as "The Wedge," "Death 
of a Gremmie," "The Long Ride," "Let's Go Trippin' " and "Miserlou." 
</P>
<P>
On the rocking "Jessie Pearl," he played with his fretting hand angled above 
the neck, like Jeff Healy's difficult technique. On that and his other vocal 
numbers, he displayed a rough voice that sounded like Barry McGuire on the 
morning after the "Eve of Destruction," but it got the job done. He also 
delivered some surprisingly hot tenor-sax honking on the R&amp;B oldie "Cherry 
Pie." 
</P>
<P>
Dale was born in Beirut, and there's a good deal of Middle Eastern influence 
mixed in with his California beach music. His speed picking is reminiscent of 
oud playing, and his most melodic playing, as on "The Victor," is based on 
Middle Eastern modalities. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Dale didn't work from a set list, and he wound up playing some 
numbers twice. They were worth the reprise: After offering a hot double-picked 
version of the Chantays' "Pipeline" early in the set, he repeated it near the 
end but played it with a ferocity, speed and power that even the most 
aggressive punk outfit couldn't have matched. 
</P>
<P>
Dale is a true phenomenon, one of the few Orange County can boast of, and he 
should be seen while he's still around. Like Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis, 
his performances can be uneven and unpredictable, but -- also like them -- he's 
an American originator, and there's no one else like him.

SEIZED GUITARS ATTRACT COLLECTORS

<P>
The collector shouted "8,000" to the auctioneer, and Brent Haesler knew it was 
time to quit bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Haesler, an amateur guitarist from Palos Verdes, was prepared to spend up to 
$4,000 for a classic six-string but instead settled for a well-worn 1950 
acoustic that was easily within budget at $300. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this many collectible guitars in one location," said Haesler, 
36, whose modest collection includes a 1957 Gibson Les Paul. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 dealers, collectors and musicians from Washington to Japan 
converged on an Upland auction yard Thursday night to bid on 87 vintage guitars 
seized last year from a Thousand Oaks drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
When the bidding ended, United Auctions had taken in $112,850, and the 
anti-drug unit of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was $102,693.50 
richer, after deducting a 9% auctioneer's fee. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies seized the guitars, along with $76,155 in cash and a 1988 
Camaro, during a September, 1989, raid on the Potrero Road residence of William 
H. Budnik. 
</P>
<P>
Budnik argued that he paid legitimate money for the guitars, whose value he 
estimated at about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped the claim after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana for sale 
and serving several months of a one-year sentence in the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was held under an outdoor canopy with a jazz band accompanying 
registered bidders who wanted to test the guitars' sound quality. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Sullivan, 57, of Thousand Oaks satisfied a longtime desire when he 
walked away with a 1949 Gibson jazz guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who works in the electronics industry, said he has put off guitar 
studies for years because he lacked a finely crafted instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an affinity for Gibsons since I had one in college that I sold when 
money got tight," Sullivan said. "This scratches a longtime itch." 
</P>
<P>
Collector Mac Yasuda paid the top price of the night in shelling out $8,000 for 
a 1962 Fender Stratocaster, which was valued at $10,000. Several of the most 
expensive guitars sold below their appraised values, while many guitars worth 
$200 to $300 netted twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of happy buyers who walked away with bargains," said Bob Mohs of 
United Auctions. 
</P>
<P>
But, "There may be some purchases that people will be disappointed about once 
they come out from under the ether." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials suspected that Budnik might turn up to reclaim 
some of his most coveted pieces, but auction officials recorded no sales to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Thompson, the Sheriff Department's property custodian, said the onetime 
owner could only have gone away heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guitars here he could never replace," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Doug Moran of United Auctions: "It would be tough for him to show up. Sort 
of like going to your girlfriend's wedding or being the bellhop on her 
honeymoon." CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

ROCKIN' RICHMAN RIDES THE TIDE OF LIFE -- WITH A PASSION; 
</P>
<P>
POP: THE LEADER OF THE MODERN LOVERS HAS TURNED HIS REMARKABLE ENTHUSIASM TO 
SURF MUSIC, BUT THAT WON'T BE THE ONLY KIND OF MUSIC HE PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE 
COACH HOUSE IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, WHERE HE SHARES THE BILL WITH DICK DALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Guitarist Brennan Totten, who toured for a few years with Jonathan Richman's 
Modern Lovers, can recall an occasion when he was pulled over by a state 
trooper while driving the band through Texas. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a routine traffic citation wound up with the officer giving them 
the third degree, having been discomfited by the sight of Richman, star of the 
international stage and recording world, perched barefoot and birdlike on the 
rear seat, all-but heedless of the police presence as he shoveled down a quart 
of Haagen-Dazs with an unnerving abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Richman really likes to eat. Driving to Orange County from his Northern 
California home, he will pick up a Harris Ranch pie and eat it by the handful, 
along with yogurt, Cornnuts, malteds and the standard road food cornucopia. At 
2 a.m. in a coffee shop, he'll have the chili, the banana pancakes and the 
onion rings. 
</P>
<P>
His current "Jonathan Richman" album contains a bit of oratory that addresses 
this subject, "I Eat With Gusto, Damn! You Bet." And therein lies one of the 
constants of Richman's work: He sings about the things he has a passion for. 
</P>
<P>
That he -- given his caloric intake -- doesn't possess the approximate bulk of 
a water bed says something about the nature of Richman's passions: He tends to 
do most things with gusto, so energetically tackling every moment that one 
suspects he even slumbers with a taxing enthusiasm. If a phone conversation 
with him sounds just a bit disjointed, it's probably because he's 
simultaneously flipping on his backyard trampoline. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, when he was a self-described "brooding Angst-ridden adolescent," 
Richman recorded "The Modern Lovers," an album sufficiently dark and uptight to 
influence the Sex Pistols and a host of other glum chums, and to be regarded 
more recently by Rolling Stone magazine as No. 52 in its list of the "100 Best 
Albums of the Last 20 Years." 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, though, Richman's songs instead have evoked a world that's 
loose and limber, where, when "your friends are dancing on the lawn, no one 
acts like something's wrong"; where love and romance win out over fear; and 
where one can be snared passionately by the life reaching out from Van Gogh 
paintings, a sleeping wife, old corner stores, a hot summer night, or even 
discarded chewing gum wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 38-year-old's present enthusiasms is surf music; a desire to play 
some twang-oriented bills led to his shows with "King of the Surf Guitar" Dick 
Dale tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and Saturday at Bogart's 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Orange County two weeks ago, Richman claimed: "The fixation with surf 
guitar isn't recent. It's something people were comparing my guitar style to 
even when I was starting out. It's part of my guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
"The new fixation is wanting to be part of the Southern California music scene 
because I'm lonely up there in Northern Cal right now. The closest music scene 
I can think of to what I'm doing is surf music, at least of the music that's 
still being played now in California." 
</P>
<P>
Richman won't be particularly more surf-bent at these shows than he's ever been 
-- indeed, he's recently taken to accompanying himself with only a 
nylon-stringed classical guitar. But he sees several connections between the 
two types of music. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, there's a strong love of nature in both styles -- it's 
physical. And second, there's also a kind of dreaminess in surf music that is 
also in mine. The way they describe a scene with guitars, I tend to describe it 
more with words, but with both you're supposed to feel it rather than 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"Another reason why I like playing with surf acts is both styles are party 
music, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want it to be a concert. I want it to 
be like a party, which to me is where you feel loose enough to dance, without 
anybody making a big deal out of it, and where you have a lot of fun. I think 
once rock 'n' roll got taken seriously, it ruined everything." 
</P>
<P>
Although Richman rhapsodizes about the surf scene and wanting to take part in 
the sort of 12-act rock-and-roll cavalcades that rumbled through the states in 
the '50s, he insists he's not living in the past but rather hoping for a future 
when our pop culture may get back that early warmth and innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be part of something new," he said. "I've been lonely for stuff 
before, but now is the time when I sense something different could happen. And 
I also think that these '80s were lonely enough where I just want to reach out 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"That's also why I'm doing my country record (due out on Rounder later this 
year). I want to be a part of there being more communication between different 
kinds of musicians." (Victor Borge is Richman's favorite stage performer. He 
also has a warm regard for the early Iggy Pop.) 
</P>
<P>
And what makes him think the '90s can be different from the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even have a clue. I just want it to be. I'm ready for the '90s. I 
didn't like the '80s. It was just so distant. Great things happened to me 
personally in the '80s, but overall it was just a decade where more people 
drove by, and less where they got out of the car and shook hands." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of his harsher critics seem to presume that Richman gets his 
hopeful view of the world from the Care Bears, he is distressingly well-read on 
the sorry ecological, political and cultural state of things. But he chooses to 
think some good eventually may come from our overstressed times. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," he said, "I think L.A. may be one of the first cities to get a 
really terrific public transportation system because the pollution is getting 
so bad, I think it's going to push it in that good direction. And overall, I 
think when things get isolated so much, like they did in the '80s, people will 
get tired of it and want to get closer." 
</P>
<P>
While the song "Closer" on the "Jonathan Richman" album is about his wife, 
Gail, closer also describes Richman's professional direction. The ideal 
performance to him is one where the audience shows "lots of emotion: I want to 
see lots of gnashing of teeth and beating on chests, weeping and wailing. I 
want to see crying and dancing in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
To that end he employs the nylon-string guitar and performs solo because the 
nakedness of thesound makes for a more intimate show -- "I was pretty 
spontaneous anyway with a band; now I'm unstoppable." He thinks volume has its 
place in teen-age music but likens his over-amped contemporaries to "seeing 
your dad at the intersection revving the engine of his sports car. It's 
embarrassing." In a bio sent to fans last year, he described high-volume as 
"not a necessity but a hindrance to communication and intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
He's not one to go for technological blockades on his records either. Most of 
the "Jonathan Richman" album was first-take material, with only his stamping 
feet accompanying his guitar and vocals on several tracks. (Two instrumentals, 
"Blue Moon" and "Sleepwalk," feature longtime bass associate Curly Keranen and 
the late Ron Wilson, creator of what is undoubtedly the world's most copied 
drum solo, the original "Wipeout.") 
</P>
<P>
The record not only contains mistakes, but also has a song extolling them, "A 
Mistake Today for Me." There is the French-language "Que Reste-T-ll de Nos 
Amours?" from French balladeer Charles Trenet, while "Fender Stratocaster" 
paints a rocking, shimmering impressionistic vision of that O.C.-born electric 
guitar: 
</P>
<P>
 Like the wind in your hair when the top is down, 
</P>
<P>
 Like taillights headed for another town, 
</P>
<P>
 Fender Stratocaster, there's something about that sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I started playing music when I was 17, I wanted to be a painter," 
Richman recalls. "Then I realized I could make stuff happen right in front of 
people, not just do it at home and have them see it later. Once I saw that, I 
said, 'Whooa! That's what I want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's still the case. "I promised myself then that I'd quit if it ever became 
work instead of fun. It would really take some searching to find something I'd 
enjoy nearly as much as this." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Richman and the Dick Dale Power Trio play tonight at 9 at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information: 
(714) 496-8930.

   ``I have thought about making a career out of western music if I
am good enough but I will just have to wait to see how that turns
out.'' _ Buddy Holly, (high school autobiography).

<DATELINE>IRVING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maria Elena Holly spends much of her time
hunched over a paper-piled desk in her home, trying to make Buddy
Holly's dreams come true.
   The legendary singer, songwriter and musician, who with his own
blend of rock 'n' roll and country influenced the Beatles, the
Rolling Stones and many others, dreamed that he would inspire young
musicians and pave their way in the industry, his widow said.
   ``If Buddy were still alive, I think that he would be involved in
every facet of the music industry,'' she said.
   Although she has tried to realize that dream through a Buddy
Holly scholarship fund, preferably at Texas Tech University in
Holly's hometown of Lubbock, or through a festival there, each
attempt has failed.
   Three decades after Holly was killed in a plane crash, his widow
pursues his dreams by answering letters from fans who say they will
always remember, and from opportunists who say there is money to be
made making sure the public doesn't forget.
   Maria Elena Holly receives letters from three to 10 people each
day.
   ``Buddy wrote and wanted his music to be received in a positive
way and for people to enjoy it and for people to be inspired by his
music and his determination to make it out there,'' she said.
   ``And that's where I come in with the youngsters. I feel that
through the letters, it has done that. Anything that is a positive
thing received from Buddy Holly's music, it makes me happy. It
pushes me out there to continue putting his name out there and keep
it there.''
   But she's not making Holly available to the public without some
personal benefit.
   In 1987, she successfully lobbied Texas lawmakers to approve
legislation giving her full rights to Holly's name, voice, likeness,
photographs and signature. Under the law, Holly's ``property''
cannot be used for commercial purposes without her approval.
   Bill Griggs, president and founder of the Buddy Holly Memorial
Society, says the law serves a good purpose.
   ``If you go to Memphis, Tenn., to Graceland, across the street is
souvenir store after souvenir store. You can buy Elvis Presley
toilet paper, which to me is the epitome of bad taste,'' he said.
``That's why Maria Elena is so tough. She wants to make sure
everything is done above board and in good taste.''
   Not only does the law keep Holly's name and face off beer cans,
as one entrepreneur proposed, but it also allows her to profit from
the Buddy Holly music boxes, posters and T-shirts that are sold.
   ``That was his legacy he left to us (his family) and the music
was his legacy he left to everybody,'' she said. ``I feel very
strongly that if someone is going to make money, I'm going to make
money and the Hollys are going to make money.''
   Maria Elena Santiago, a native of Puerto Rico, met Buddy Holly
while she was a receptionist at Peer-Southern Music Publishing Co.,
in New York. The morning after they met, Holly confronted Maria
Elena's aunt, who disliked musicians, and asked for permission to
marry her neice.
   They had been married just six months when the small plane
carrying Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper''
Richardson crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 1959, killing
all three and their pilot.
   She was pregnant when Holly left on the tour and she suffered a
miscarriage after the crash. A year after Holly died, she remarried.
She and her second husband had three children before they divorced
three years ago.
   It was her dedication to Holly that helped end her second
marriage.
   ``People ask you, `How did you get over his death?' Well you
don't get over his death. You never do. You cope with it, but you
never get over it,'' she said, turning her head to hide tears.
``Sometimes I do get upset and then I pick myself up and I say this
is not going to bring him back, so why not keep him here.''
   Besides a few posthumously bestowed music awards and a few photos
of Holly, she keeps his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar and his black,
plastic-frame glasses. The glasses were found long after the crash,
stored in an Iowa sheriff's files.
   Holly's Fender Stratocaster and other belongings are in Lubbock
with his family, who are involved in negotiations with his widow to
divide the items.
   Although she appreciates a statue erected by Holly's friends, she
would have preferred the money to have been spent on a music
scholarship.
   ``That's what Buddy wanted,'' she said of the scholarship.
``Buddy wanted to help young people get established in the music
industry, to be able to help them in whatever career they chose in
music.''

DICK DALE'S DEL-TONES SAVOR THE SURGE OF '60S PROPULSIVE SURF ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The essence of surf music has been obscured by all the lightweight imagery that 
went with it back when the Southern California dream was being retailed to an 
eager nation: Frankie and Annette, beach blanket bingo, fun fun fun in the 
California sun. 
</P>
<P>
All those trappings may have helped sell surf music back in its early-'60s 
heyday, but it is the core musical notion behind the style that makes it worth 
listening to now. The idea was to infuse a rock instrumental with the feeling 
of being caught up in a wild, elemental surge. 
</P>
<P>
As the prime inventor of surf-guitar music, Dick Dale is not likely to neglect 
that essence. It has been more than 30 years since he created the style in the 
long-vanished dance halls of Balboa and Huntington Beach. But playing Friday 
night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano with his current bunch of 
backing Del-Tones, Dale showed that he still knows how to take his guitar on a 
wild, dramatic ride. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's two 50-minute sets covered the lighthearted, beach party aspect of his 
genre with honking, horn-driven R&amp;B numbers, '50s rock classics and a few 
of his own more chirpy oldies. But the real thrills came when Dale, 51, set the 
bouncier stuff aside and got down to blazing dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
After quickie renditions of a couple of his lighter signature tunes, "Let's Go 
Trippin' " and "Mr. Peppermint Man," Dale began to play definitive surf rock 
that featured fast, staccato picking, reverb-soaked tone and careening slides 
down the neck of his old, gold-spangled Fender Stratocaster. It all came 
together on a propulsive "Surf Beat," then continued as Dale changed the mood 
to flamenco-style grandeur during a fine, shifting number that alternated 
between flurrying riffing and slow, stately Spanish motifs. 
</P>
<P>
The segment closed at a gallop, featuring the Del-Tones' punchy young 
three-piece horn section. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the early set, Dale and rhythm guitarist Ron Eglit got into some 
fiery dueling as they replayed the "Pipeline" guitar duet that won Dale and 
Stevie Ray Vaughan a 1987 Grammy nomination (the Vaughan-Dale guitar shoot-out 
is the closing track on a new, 18-song Rhino Records CD release, "King of the 
Surf Guitar: The Best of Dick Dale &amp; His Del-Tones"). 
</P>
<P>
The ideal way to see Dale in concert might be in one of those old-time rock 'n' 
roll revues of the early to mid-'60s, where each act got to display its best 
stuff for 15 minutes or half an hour. Then the set could be one driving wave, 
with maybe a couple of jaunty numbers like "Let's Go Trippin' " thrown in for 
relief between surges. 
</P>
<P>
But Dale and the Del-Tones also had a good-time, dance-band function to 
fulfill. They did a capable job of it, judging from the lively dance-floor 
traffic through most of the show (when the "Peter Gunn" theme turned out to be 
a crowd favorite, Dale took his band through three different renditions of it). 
</P>
<P>
Dale, looking like a craggy-faced John Wayne under his black cowboy hat, played 
most of the show off the cuff, singing a snippet of one song, then launching 
abruptly into another. A round-the-world routine in which Dale played just 
about every instrument on the band stand, including trumpet, keyboards and 
drums, had more shtick value than musical appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's audience ranged from old-time fans to fashionable, scrubbed-looking kids 
who would not have looked out of place at a Depeche Mode show. Being a local 
hero probably helps his continuing appeal, but Dale's playing remains a strong 
attraction on its merits, and a must-see for guitar aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
The surf-guitar style may be historic, but the wild rides Dale takes with it 
are by no means history.

Walter Trout marked a milestone Wednesday night with his first show as a 
headliner at the Coach House, but the performance's eruption of passion and 
hyper-driven energy is almost a standard night's work for this uncommonly 
dynamic Orange County blues player. 
</P>
<P>
Trout's path to top billing at the county's leading concert club wasn't easy. 
When he first came here from Philadelphia in 1974, looking to establish himself 
as a hot guitar slinger, he couldn't find a niche in the local blues scene and 
had to settle for twanging in country bands. But he persisted, and touring 
stints with Canned Heat and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers established him as a 
well-traveled, well-regarded sideman. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach resident left Mayall to go solo a year ago. While he has 
made progress in Scandinavia with several tours and an album release, Trout is 
still trying to establish himself as a big fish in the American blues-rock 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from his show Wednesday night, all the qualifications are in place. For 
one thing, Trout is a legitimate keeper of the blues-rocker-as-gladiator 
tradition handed down from Buddy Guy to Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughan, 
achieving a showman's flash as well as an ace player's precision. Trout also 
has a strong, flexible natural voice that he embellished with a husky blues 
growl or a Little Richard falsetto cry. And his band was first rate. Dan 
(Mongo) Abrams, on Hammond organ, and drummer Allen Adams both stood out when 
they got the spotlight. Abrams consistently created parts that were nimble but 
meaty, recalling the Band's Garth Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour concert ranged widely, from Trout's driving, dark anthem about 
street violence, "Life in the Jungle," to jaunty barroom blues-rock excursions, 
to emotive readings of agonized classics like John Lee Hooker's "Serve Me Right 
to Suffer" and Robert Johnson's "Love in Vain." Trout, who dedicated the show 
to the memory of Sarah Vaughan, reached for the unexpected with a moving, 
achingly soulful version of Bob Dylan's "Girl From the North Country." It's a 
dimension that Trout should have explored further with "The Mountain Song" and 
"Frederica," two fine wistful numbers from his album that went unplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Slimmed down considerably from his paunchy Bluesbreakers days (Mayall used to 
jokingly refer to Trout and the band's other guitarist, Coco Montoya, as "the 
belly brothers"), Trout put on a show that was equal parts visual excitement 
and sonic sizzle. He wielded his Stratocaster guitar like a trophy or a lance, 
with all the paroxysms of battle showing on his face and in his playing stance. 
</P>
<P>
That Samurai guitarist approach can be dangerous: battalions of would-be heavy 
metal heroes have made ridiculous spectacles of themselves with moves similar 
to Trout's. The difference is that Trout's flamboyance springs from the 
emotions of the moment, not from some calculated attempt to strike a guitar 
hero's pose. It's a natural thing, like the frenzy of a salmon on its last 
headlong run. 
</P>
<P>
The other risk in Trout's approach is the prolific amount of playing he does. 
His guitar style is fast, propulsive and accelerating -- on slow blues as well 
as quick-paced shuffles and rockers. Trout saved himself from the tedium of 
overplaying by working his speeding stream of notes into clean, coherent 
phrases that always made melodic sense. But his cornucopia of near-continuous 
soloing became, after a while, too much of a good thing. Confronted with so 
much sound streaming from Trout's guitar, one began to long for space and 
spareness, the eloquence of the pauses between notes. He did achieve contrast 
with quieter passages in which he worked the strings to achieve a tone 
reminiscent of a bowed violin. But Trout resorted to that trick a few times too 
many. 
</P>
<P>
Trout's fast musical metabolism seems to be an inbred part of his makeup -- the 
natural fuse that sets off his exciting performances. Perhaps economy and 
restraint are just not part of that makeup. But if he could create a tension 
between restraint and his natural wildness, the excitement might become even 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
There's not much excitement in an unknown band copying a famous band that isn't 
worth copying. That, unfortunately, is what local newcomers Love of Fire did by 
fashioning an opening set that did INXS to excess. Singer Roger Benes echoed 
the reedy tone and drawling voice inflections of INXS pinup Michael Hutchence. 
But instead of matching the Australian singer's lively stage presence, the 
languid Benes was only slightly less placid than a disc jockey working the 
overnight shift. The five-member, keyboards-dominated band was precise and 
polished with its neatly scrubbed rock-funk, but its 40-minute show fell into a 
mid-tempo rut of unremarkable songs about romance. One song, "Stand for Me," 
had a taut, pleading tone that gave it enough of an edge to sustain interest.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SURF ROCK'S HISTORY WRAPPED UP BY A LONGTIME DEVOTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Dalley was hooked in an instant when he heard the surf rock 
instrumental "Pipeline" barreling over the radio one day in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, 15 at the time, bought an electric guitar with his paper route money 
and set out to become part of the instrumental surf music scene that crested 
during the early '60s, then ebbed with the arrival of the Beatles. But it was 
with a typewriter, rather than with a Fender Stratocaster, that Dalley 
ultimately wound up writing his chapter in surf rock history. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he wrote 41 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's book, "Surfin' Guitars: Instrumental Surf Bands of the Sixties," 
devotes a chapter to each of 41 bands from the peak days of surf rock, 
including 12 hailing from Orange County. In each case, Dalley hunted up former 
members, got them to reminisce into a tape recorder, and compiled the 
histories, memorabilia and discographies that fill his 421-page, independently 
published soft-cover volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfin' Guitars" is a specialty project that will be of value and interest 
mainly to committed surf rock fans and early-'60s pop history buffs: Of the 41 
groups chronicled, only five ever placed a song in the Billboard Top 100. 
Dalley's plain but usually serviceable prose won't rescue any of the lesser 
lights from obscurity. But by giving a basic recounting of each group's story, 
along with reproductions of their photos, posters and press clippings, he has 
managed to safeguard them from oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
For Dalley, now 40, the book originated 10 years ago with his own attempt to 
regain a bit of youthful spark. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going crazy, not being in a band, not doing anything," said the 
friendly, broad-built Azusa resident who makes his living reproducing documents 
for microfilm. "The first thing I thought of was, 'Let's play some surf 
music."' 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, who grew up inland in Covina and never learned to surf, formed a surf 
rock revival band, the Surf Raiders, that stayed together through most of the 
1980s. In trying to recapture the authentic early '60s sound, he began to hunt 
for original surf music recordings. He also sought out two former members of 
the Surfaris, the band that created "Wipe Out," one of the most enduring and 
influential rock instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's aim was only to ask their advice on how to replicate the '60s surf 
sound. But the tape-recorded talks ended up forming the basis for an article 
that he submitted to Goldmine, the record collectors' magazine. Dalley soon 
began to write a regular surf music column for Goldmine, and he continued to 
seek out interviews with original surf bands. After deciding to compile a book, 
he cast his net as widely as possible, with the aim of making a comprehensive 
surf rock history. Dalley even enlisted the help of a private detective to 
track down a charter member of one hard-to-trace band. 
</P>
<P>
While Dalley rarely strays from his straight biographical narratives into 
analysis or social commentary, "Surfin' Guitars" depicts a musical period that 
had the qualities of innocence and a naive creativity -- qualities all but 
snuffed out in today's bureaucratized, conglomerated music industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Chantays, from Santa Ana, were teen-age musical novices when they started 
in 1961, inspired by Dick Dale, the Orange County surf-rock pioneer who emerges 
repeatedly in the book as a key influence on other bands. Within a year of 
taking up their instruments, the Chantays had written and recorded "Pipeline," 
the No. 4 national hit that hooked Dalley on surf music. 
</P>
<P>
Except for rap music, a grass-roots, cheap-to-produce form that pop's corporate 
masters haven't yet found a way to control, such sudden rises are virtually 
inconceivable today. 
</P>
<P>
Recording and promoting music has become a slow, costly, calculated business 
guided by long-term marketing strategies. One-hit, out-of-the-blue wonders like 
the Chantays -- or the Pyramids, whose "Penetration" was also a Top 20 surf hit 
-- simply don't get signed nowadays by major labels, which look at bands either 
as tax write-offs or as expensive, long-term investments. It is true that 
smaller, independent labels sign such bands all the time, but no prominent pop 
radio station seems to have the gumption to run with an unknown act's song and 
give it the airing it may deserve. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, surprise hits like "Pipeline" and "Wipe Out" were the norm. What the 
music business gives us today is a world in which surprise is barely possible. 
Aside from rap -- which requires the guidance of a technologically savvy 
producer -- there is no place in the pop mainstream today for the kinds of 
musically unschooled, naive enthusiasts who gave us surf music and its direct 
heirs, mid-'60s garage-rock and psychedelic rock. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiast's spirit lives with Robert Dalley. Before he could go to press 
with his book, he said, he had to come up with about $13,000 to pay for 
printing. He raised some of it by selling his guitar and amplifiers and -- 
after committing his favorite songs to tape -- by auctioning his collection of 
rare surf records. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done everything I can to promote surf music," Dalley said. "My book is 
the culmination of it. I don't see what more I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Dalley figures he eventually will at least break even by selling his first 
printing of 2,000 copies through an international network of surf music fans. 
The book, published in November, is on sale at Music Market in Costa Mesa and 
Soest Guitar Repair in Orange, Dalley said. Copies, priced at $28, also are 
available by mail from Robert J. Dalley at Dept. OC, 6209 Oakbank Drive, Azusa, 
Calif. 91702. 
</P>
<P>
As for hearing the old surf rock style played live, Dalley said, several 
revival bands and a handful of reformed original surf rock combos still 
perform, including the Surfaris and the Chantays. Dick Dale and the Deltones 
remain an Orange County rock institution; they can be heard Friday night at 
Night Moves in Huntington Beach. Information: (714) 840-6118. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra's Mind Over 4 looks like a shoo-in for hardest working band in Orange 
County (if not the known universe). The quartet, which blends pounding 
thrash-metal with art-rock atmospherics, went into For the Record studios in 
Orange on last Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to singer Spike Xavier, and 
emerged Saturday at 3 p.m. after nonstop recording and mixing of a new, 12-song 
album. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hours' rest and relaxation, they played a Saturday night show at 
Night Moves. 
</P>
<P>
Why such a hectic schedule? Mind Over 4 recently signed a European recording 
deal with Destiny Records, a West German company, and wants to have the album 
out by late May when the band will begin a 2 1/2-month tour of Europe (with the 
Vandals, satiric punk rockers with Orange County origins of their own). 
</P>
<P>
Mind Over 4 was due to leave Wednesday night on a cross-country tour that will 
end with a showcase gig at CBGB's, the famed New York City alternative rock 
bar. Then it is on to West Germany for the start of the European tour, which 
also will take the band through Holland, Yugoslavia, France, Spain, Italy, 
England and Ireland. The Vandals will go on to Iceland; Mind Over 4 will fly 
back to New York in late August, play its way back across the country and 
arrive in Orange County just in time to start recording yet another album, this 
time for Powerhouse Records, a new Orange County-based label. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to take at least 5 days recording that one," Xavier said. In 
all, he said, Mind Over 4 expects to play 110 shows over the next 120 days -- a 
schedule with the potential to turn the most leathery-lunged singer's vocal 
chords into thin spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Xavier said. "I got the magic potion: hot tea and peach brandy 
right before I go on stage. It totally works."

RICHMAN, BURNETT: A PAIRING OFF THAT PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pairing of the ofttimes whimsical Jonathan Richman with T-Bone Burnett, 
writer of some of rock's most convoluted and weightedly ambiguous tomes, might 
not have seemed such a natural thing prior to their show Saturday at the Coach 
House. In retrospect, though, it seemed little less than inspired as, despite 
very different approaches, each performer is essentially a moralist. 
</P>
<P>
While Burnett's cerebral approach to delineating moral dilemmas has garnered 
him gobs of critic-bestowed "importance," Richman is a far more effective 
communicator on stage. For more than a decade he has been tirelessly offering 
his vision of what rock 'n' roll should be -- direct, human and as stripped of 
the hyped-up volume and trappings of arena as possible -- and the effort has 
paid off. Performed with an alarming earnestness, even his lyrics about 
chewing-gum wrappers or Greyhound bus trips become a challenge to touch the 
intensity in each moment of life. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, his short set offered odes to heroes as divergent as Vincent Van 
Gogh, whose "paintings had those colors because he loved life so bad," and 
baseball great Walter Johnson, who, Richman's song explained, "cared about 
people more than he cared about fame." 
</P>
<P>
On stage, Richman very much exemplifies the inspiration he sings about, making 
up verses on the spot and even, after an offhand request from an audience 
member, reprising one of his new songs, "Closer," with an on-the-spot Spanish 
translation. He accented his lyrics with a body language rich in the romance 
tongues and at times in mid-song would eschew his guitar and the microphone 
altogether to sing more directly to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
One of his still-unreleased songs was full of playful imagery about one of 
Orange County's grand contributions to American culture -- the Fender 
Stratocaster guitar: "Like the wind in your hair when the top is down, like 
taillights headed for another town: Fender Stratocaster." More often, though, 
his lyrics were haunting in their immersion in the world most of us lose with 
youth, as on the encore "That Summer Feeling": "When there's things to do, not 
because you've gotta / When you run for love, not because you oughtta / When 
you trust your friends with no reason not ta / That joy I've named shall not be 
tamed, and that summer feeling is going to haunt you one day in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett, despite fighting an obvious case of nerves that may have been due to a 
5-year performing layoff, delivered a set whose strengths were obscured only by 
its length. Basically, Burnett is a performer as monochromatic as the ice-cream 
suit he sported, lacking the variety to give his set's 25 songs their full due. 
</P>
<P>
Paring it down to his strong points, though, it was a triumphal return. He 
relied little on the sometimes leaden allegories of his recent "The Talking 
Animals" album, delving more into 1983's "Proof Though the Night" and 1982's 
"The Trap Door." 
</P>
<P>
From the latter, he performed the biting "After All These Years," written 
following a coroner's disinterment of Marilyn Monroe's body. The song is a 
bitter attack at the way the essence of a person, not to say the person's 
dignity, is ignored in the hero-making process. Saturday, Burnett rededicated 
the song to Elvis Presley, while also wryly noting that if the proliferation of 
Elvis impersonators continues at the rate it has since his death, by 2010, one 
out of three people in the world will be one. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Burnett's strongest songs were also among his least ambiguous, 
particularly those from his sadly overlooked 1986 country album, "T-Bone 
Burnett." Of those "River of Love" and "Shake Yourself Loose" offered 
bittersweet ruminations on life and relationships that sailed in their spare 
simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Such songs could only have been stronger if Burnett had left out some of his 
lesser songs. Except for when he brought on Sam Phillips, his wife, for two 
songs during his nine-song encore, there was a cumulative sameness to the show 
that blunted its edge.

   On Records: New Stuff From Dylan, the Nevilles, et. al.
   ----
   By Jim Fusilli
</HL>
<DATE>
09/25/90
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20
</SO>
<LP>
   While artists of lesser stature trumpet their new releases
with hyperbolic fanfare, Bob Dylan continues to write and
record his songs, distribute his albums and move on to the
next project. His latest recording, "Under the Red Sky"
(Columbia), is raw, spontaneous, and by design not very
pretty; its lyrics are cryptic and mature. So it's everything
rock albums aren't today. For that alone, it's a gem.
   Under the guidance of producer Don Was, and aided by Al
Kooper, whose whistling organ licks propelled "Like a Rolling
Stone," among other time-framed classics, Dylan has returned
to his circa 1968 rocking roots, spewing a volley of words
over a pounding band, flinging images against a torrent of
drums, bass and whirling guitars. Close your eyes and there
he is, the shock of curly hair, the sunglasses, the Fender
Stratocaster slung over his shoulder, the leather jacket, the
torn, faded jeans: The more than 20 years it's been since
"Blonde on Blonde" vanish with a listening. Taken with last
year's pensive, Daniel Lanois-produced "Oh Mercy," "Under a
Red Sky" demonstrates that there need be no "new Bob Dylan"
as long as the real thing's still around.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Speaking of Daniel Lanois, in 1989 the producer stepped in
to help the Neville Brothers find their own voice on "Yellow
Moon," the group's most successful record, both commercially
and artistically. This year the Nevilles, sans Lanois, have
taken their sound a step further and the resulting recording,
"Brother's Keeper" (A&amp;M), is their best work. By now,
finally, Aaron Neville is a star and rightfully so:
"Aaronesque" should be an adjective to describe a sweet,
heart-wrenching and perfect vocal performance. The other
Neville vocalists, gruff Art and buoyant Cyril, contribute
quality performances, and the material, as it did on "Yellow
Moon," matches the brothers' talent. Check out the snap and
funk of "Brother Jake" or the plaintive moan of Link Wray's
"Fallin' Rain" and try to come up with a band that's better
at getting an audience to dance and cry within a beat. One
quibble: The Nevilles apparently have jettisoned guitarist
Brian Stoltz, whose work was a high point on both "Yellow
Moon" and Dylan's "Oh Mercy." On the plus side, the song
"Fearless" features the booming voice of Linda Ronstadt, with
whom Aaron Neville had the huge 1989 hit "Don't Know Much."
Ronstadt produced Aaron's forthcoming, much-awaited solo
album.
   If the Neville Brothers aren't America's best band, Living
Colour may very well be. The New York-based quartet is heavy
metal's most defiantly versatile act, and on their new album,
"Time's Up" (Epic), they display their wide range: hard-core
power wailing, a dab of rap, a flicker of jazz, warm
harmonies, and in "Love Rears Its Ugly Head," a witty blues.
Crushing four-square rock is still their metier, however, and
there's plenty of it here, propelled by a ferocious rhythm
section of Muzz Skillings and William Calhoun. Led by the
inventive guitarist Vernon Reid, Living Colour may be too
gifted for its own good, but every cut on "Time's Up" is a
delight. And loud.
   Following 1988's studied "Blue Skies," one might've
expected another flawless rendering of classic,
acoustic-based jazz by the New York vocalist Cassandra
Wilson. Not so. Her latest, "Jumpworld" (JMT Records), may be
a classic, but you won't find the likes of "Shall We Dance"
and "I've Grown Accustomed to His Face" here. "Jumpworld" is
a fierce flood of colors, all drawn from the broad palette of
today's jazz and featuring Wilson's extraordinary voice.
Driving her trio and guest performers Steve Coleman, David
Gilmour, Greg Osby and Lonnie Plaxico, Wilson is dynamic,
adventurous and oh so confident. She proves herself a fine
producer and talented songwriter as well, equally adept at
seductive jazz and ardent funk. Where her gifts will take her
next is anybody's guess.
   "Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings" (Columbia)
contains every recording ever made by the legendary bluesman.
The 41 tracks -- 29 songs and 12 alternate takes, marvelously
restored by Frank Abbey -- include Johnson's familiar
compositions "Cross Road Blues," "Sweet Home Chicago," "Love
in Vain," "Come in My Kitchen," among others. While it's a
delight to hear Johnson sing his own songs, it's a revelation
to hear his hypnotic guitar playing. In the liner notes, Eric
Clapton calls Johnson the greatest bluesman who ever lived,
and this collection goes a long way to support his claim. The
multirecord set, part of Columbia's "Roots 'n' Blues" series,
is lovingly packaged, and includes a Johnson biography by
Stephen C. LeVere, a bevy of photos -- including one of
Johnson's death certificate; the amorous bluesman was 27
years old when he contracted pneumonia after being poisoned
by a jealous rival -- and the annotated lyrics to each song.
The set is precisely the kind of tribute a master like
Johnson deserves.

<HEAD>Julian Bream Guitar Makes Record Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of
English classical guitarist Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100,
a world auction record for the instrument, Sotheby's said.
   The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday
by a Japanese dealer whose name was not available. The previous
record was $18,900, paid in 1974 for a south German guitar made in
1624.
   Acoustic guitars are the traditional models of the instrument
and they tend to wear out fairly quickly when used.
   Bream has said he plays his guitars for two years and then likes
to sell them for others to play.
   Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far
more money: one owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for
$322,000.
   The record guitar and five others sold by Bream Thursday brought
in a total of $56,100.

<HEADLINE>  RINKER KNOWS DRIVING ISN'T JUST FOR SHOW  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For reference purposes, this is approximately 2.284 fewer strokes per hole
than the average duffer -- including those who play only miniature golf.;   
Rinker beats them all, however, at least by the numbers. He is the
Blademaster. He is the King of Ping. He is the Prince of Plumb-Bob.;    He is
also embarrassed, a little bit.;    "I had a good putting year in 1990," says
Rinker, sitting in a clubhouse easy chair here at the Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am. "But I really don't believe I'm the best putter out here on Tour.";   
Then who is?;    "Morris Hatalsky," answers Rinker.;    Morris Hatalsky?;   
"Everybody talks about Ben Crenshaw being the best putter among the
superstars," Rinker says, "and he is very good. But when the Tour figured out
the statistics for the last 10 years, Morris was the best putter.";    Sure
enough, Rinker is correct. But we aren't here today to revive that classic
golf debate of Hatalsky vs. Rinker. Rather, we are here to debunk a classic
golf myth.;    You know the one we mean. It was spawned years ago, by the late
golf pro Bobby Locke when he poetically opined:;    "You drive for show, but
you putt for dough.";    To which Larry Rinker could now reply:;    "Oh, yeah?
Then how come I finished 117th on the prize money list last year?";    You can
look that up, too. Rinker may be the Tour's best putter. He may be the
Blademaster. But he wasn't even among the top 100 money winners last year.;   
"I guess I haven't been driving for show lately," Rinker says.;    Neither has
Hatalsky, it seems. He was 59th on the money list in 1990.;    This just
proves two things:;    1. Statistics are deceiving.;    2. Statistics in golf
are completely deceiving.;    The PGA Tour first began keeping detailed stats
some 10 years ago. But the problem with golf, when you try to quantify it in
numerical terms other than strokes per hole, is that you can't possibly factor
in all of the variables.;    It's true that the Tour putting stats only are
counted when players reach greens in the regulation number of strokes (to
prevent golfers who chip on from the fringe and one-putt every green from
finishing No. 1). Yet there's still no way to know, for example, whether a
putt was hit across a spike mark on the final hole of a tournament with
thousands of dollars at stake, or whether it was hit from a perfect piece of
turf on a Thursday morning with no pressure at all. Timing is everything.;   
Rinker, who at age 33 is still looking for his first Tour victory, understands
this better than anyone. It's probably why he goes back to his hotel room
every night and plays his electric guitar. He may not look like a former
member of a garage rock band -- Rinker has a freckled face, a trim haircut,
and a laconic manner -- but he always travels with his favorite Fender
Stratocaster.;    "When I travel to tournaments," he says, "I check my golf
clubs with the baggage, and carry my guitar onto the plane.";    He then hooks
up the Fender to headphones, so he won't disturb his hotel neighbors. He finds
it helps to relieve the tension. Thursday night here, Rinker didn't have much
of that, after shooting a 67 in the first round at Pebble Beach.;    But then,
Friday morning at Poppy Hills, his traditional problem surfaced. It is best
illustrated by another statistic. On the Tour list of "Greens Hit in
Regulation," Rinker ranked 157th last year. He reached only 61.8 percent of
greens in the recommended number of strokes.;    Friday, sorry to say, he
followed form perfectly. On the 16th hole, he hit his drive into the left
rough, then hit his second shot into a sand trap. He popped out of the sand to
within four feet, but -- here's the worst part -- missed the putt. Rinker went
on to shoot a 77, putting him back at even par for the tournament. Then he
went home to his guitar and, presumably, played the blues.;    Maybe that's
what Bobby Locke meant to say all along: You drive for show, putt for dough,
and strum for sanity.  </TEXT>

   Henry Goldrich is the guy who told Harry Chapin
that ``Taxi'' ran too long to be a hit. He's also the guy who
kicked George Benson out of his store because of that annoying
guitar.
   ``Back in the '60s, I told Paul (Simon) that Simon and Garfunkel
was a lousy name. And I still think it is,'' says Goldrich.
   Fortunately, musicians want instruments and not advice from
Goldrich _ which is why his music store, Manny's on West 48th
Street, has served everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Guns N' Roses
in the past five decades.
   The Beatles invaded Manny's before they did the rest of country;
these days, Sean Lennon buys his guitars there. Mick Jagger was
looking for the right ax for this year's Stones' tour when he ran
into Bo Diddley. David Johansen has been a customer since he was a
New York Doll; he visits now as Buster Poindexter.
   ``The Who _ when they were in town, doing the show _ they were
in here. Except Daltrey. He bought a guitar once and never played
it,'' says Goldrich, dropping names as fast as Clapton works a fret
board. ``They came to my son's bar mitzvah; flew over. They're
friends.''
   Goldrich, a gray-haired, bearded man with a slight pot belly, is
the son of the original Manny and current keeper of the family
business. His dad established the store in Harlem 54 years ago, and
they became a 48th Street fixture in the late 1940s. The musicians
followed and never left.
   ``It's word of mouth. We have a very long and great
reputation,'' says Goldrich, whose earliest recollections of the
store involve a nodding John Coltrane asleep on an upstairs couch.
   Manny's customer list reads like a history of American music:
Charlie Parker in the '40s; Buddy Holly in the '50s; Jimi Hendrix
in the '60s; Paul Simon in the '70s; David Byrne in the '80s. Most
have provided autographed pictures, an invaluable collection that
covers the walls of the stores.
   ``Elvis Presley is the only big rock star who never walked in
the store. ... We delivered stuff to his hotel,'' says Goldrich.
   Manny's and Rudy's Music Stop across the street still cater to
the big names, but most of their old neighbors are gone. There were
once 25 music stores along the strip that comprised the Big Apple's
bandstand. Today, a half-dozen remain, the rest replaced by the
westward creep of Rockefeller Center and the eastern move of
grocery stores and fast-food joints.
   Such intrusions don't mean the area has lost its magnetism for
musicians, who still pass through midtown construction and the
surrounding porno shops to check out what's what.
   ``Go to West 48th Street to look at all the guitars and amps. Go
to Manny's and Rudy's. Look at all the great new equipment. That's
my idea of a good time,'' Lou Reed told Rolling Stone. Most
musicians heed his advice.
   Guns N' Roses featured the store in their video for ``Paradise
City.'' Soviet rock star Boris Grebenshikov hit the 48th Street
shops shortly after arriving in the United States to examine the
merger of music and capitalism. And then there's the time Mark
Knopfler turned a salesman into a sideman at Rudy's Music Stop.
   Part-time Rudy's worker Jack Sonni met Knopfler through the
shop, which the Dire Straits leader began frequenting in 1979. Five
years later, Sonni signed on with Dire Straits for the ``Brothers
in Arms'' LP after getting a surprise invite from Knopfler.
   At least Sonni knew who Knopfler was. When Guns N' Roses
guitarists Izzy Stradlin and Slash showed up at Manny's, Goldrich
didn't have a clue as to their identities.
   ``The music now is very heavy metal, which is not my favorite.
You can't whistle it,'' said Goldrich _ Itzhak Perlman is his kind
of musician. ``But the kids _ they're probably just as nice.''
   When Goldrich started in the business, the musicians were as
hard up for cash as the struggling Manny. A day's receipts could
total $18; many of the musicians bought on credit and took a long
time to pay, he says.
   ``Charlie Parker used to come in and play tenor sax, and
Gillespie played piano, and we used to have the greatest jam
sessions in the world,'' Goldrich recalled. ``Coltrane (tenor and
soprano saxophone) was there. Coltrane _ there's guy that owed me a
lot of money.''
   Goldrich is understandably proud of the autographed pictures
that line his store. On a small portion of one wall, The Who, the
Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin, Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Bob Dylan
sit side by side.
   ``Keep one eye closed at all cost,'' advised Dylan on his
picture.
   Goldrich himself is a one-man rock 'n' roll repository. He sold
guitars for Hendrix's and Holly's families after their deaths. His
friends include Ella Fitzgerald, John Entwistle and James Taylor.
   And he has a bit of advice _ good advice, for once _ for anybody
hoping to open a place on 48th Street.
   ``When somebody walks in the store that's famous, I think they
get worse treatment than the standard customer,'' said Goldrich.
``We're not on them constantly. ... They come in here, they wander
through the store. I don't go in awe of these guys.''

   Twenty years after his death, legendary
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix still packs 'em in.
   They don't come in large numbers at any one time, but they come.
Some bring guitars, some bring flowers. Visitors might spend a
little time at his grave, strumming tunes.
   ``The crowds here have mellowed a bit, as has the mood of the
country,'' said Hank Kerns, general manager of Greenwood Memorial
Park, where Hendrix is buried.
   ``Once in a while they'll leave a beer can, but we're careful to
get it picked up right away.''
   Kerns said the number of visitors to Hendrix's grave has
increased during the past few years, and the Goodwill Games brought
more than usual. One national magazine, he said, listed visiting
the gravesite as one of the things to do in Seattle while attending
the international athletic contest.
   Hendrix died in London on Sept. 18, 1970. According to coroner's
records, he died when he choked on his vomit. A non-lethal amount
of barbituate drugs was found in his system.
   ``Forever in our hearts,'' reads his headstone, which includes
an electric guitar carved in bas-relief. There is little to
indicate he was the king of acid rock, but by the time of his death
at age 27 he had forged a lasting legacy.
   ``I heard he was buried around here. I needed to make the
pilgrimage,'' Peg Wood said Sunday during a visit to the cemetery.
   The 26-year-old recently moved to Seattle from Illinois to begin
an internship with the Veterans Administration as she pursues a
Ph.D. in psychology. Her ``other life'' is playing rock guitar.
   ``My parents named me Peggy Sue, for God's sake. I was destined
for a life of decadent rock 'n' roll,'' she said, laughing.
   Hendrix, who grew up in Seattle's predominantly black Central
Area, was about 14 when he talked his father into buying him a $5
used guitar, according to Al Hendrix.
   ``He wore that thing out,'' the father said. ``Later on I got
him his first electric guitar and I got a sax. I didn't know much
about the sax and he didn't know much about the guitar. So we'd
make quite a bit of noise.''
   At first, the young Hendrix was content to play along with
recordings of blues greats B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
   ``So I told him, `Come up with something original,' and he
did,'' recalled Al Hendrix. ``The first time I heard `Are You
Experienced?' (the first Jimi Hendrix Experience album), it was
something altogether different than what I was used to listening
to.''
   It didn't take long for the elder Hendrix to become one of his
son's biggest fans. Innovative, sometimes outrageous and blaring
with his music, Jimi was quiet and unassuming offstage, his father
said.
   Al Hendrix still goes to his son's grave about once a month,
still gets a kick out of recalling the times he has found fans
sitting around the grave with guitars in hand.
   Fans frequently leave small items. Peg Wood added a guitar pick
to the collection there.
   ``He was the most inventive guitar player I ever heard,'' she
said. ``I like the blues. But I felt he rewrote them. He changed
the rules so that there weren't any rules. He freed me up.''

Rock's Hall of Fame: Keep It Exclusive
---
By Jim Fusilli</HL>
<DD> 02/02/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Last year, the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame welcomed its first 10 inductees, big-name performers like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, James Brown, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Ray Charles. 
Sam Phillips, founder of Sun Records, disk jockey Alan Freed, and three pre-rock musicians who influenced rockers were also honored. 
The awards ceremony and the decision to construct a Hall of Fame building in Cleveland got big play, and the baby enterprise had a rousing start. 

   Last month, the New York-based foundation that oversees the Hall and its awards ceremony tried for the same splash. 
The Jan. 21 gala bash at the Waldorf-Astoria was a triumph: Some of today's bright lights presented trophies to this year's inductees and, during a late-night jam session, Roy Orbison sang with Bruce Springsteen, Bo Diddley played with the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, and B.B. King and John Fogerty sang "In the Midnight Hour." 

   The cuisine -- meat loaf, mashed potatoes with gravy and Oreo cookies (standard rock 'n' roll backstage fare) -- was perfect. 
What wasn't perfect was the list of inductees. 

   The Hall of Fame Foundation's crack nominating committee was determined to induct 15 rock 'n' roll performers this year. 
So the deserving -- Mr. Orbison, Mr. Diddley, Mr. King, rhythm-and-blues shouter Big Joe Turner, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, Muddy Waters and Aretha Franklin, the first woman inductee -- wound up sharing the spotlight with the undeserving -- Bill Haley, Ricky Nelson, Eddie Cochran and the Coasters -- largely social phenomena who fall short of their fellow inductees as influential artists. 

   That's a trap the foundation must avoid if it intends to fulfill its promise and provide formal recognition for rock's seminal contributors. 
Consider: By inducting Mr. Haley, who's largely known for one hit, "Rock Around the Clock," somewhere down the road the Hall may have to let in Madonna, the living manifestation of all that's inartistic and manipulative about the genre. 
But by honoring the artists who've furthered rock as art, as the foundation has done in most instances, the Hall of Fame is something really terrific, not because it legitimizes the music but because it gives it its proper due. 

   All this wouldn't mean sand to the Sahara if the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and foundation weren't such a good idea. 
The group is committed to providing scholarship funding and to constructing a formal research library and archive within the museum. 
The state of Ohio and the city of Cleveland have pledged to raise the $18 million to $20 million in construction costs for a building designed by I.M. Pei. 
A site will be selected later this month. 
And the Hall of Fame awards serve as a reminder that rock didn't begin with the Beatles, or even Mr. Presley. 

   Here's how the honorees are chosen: 15 musicologists, music historians, writers and performers nominate about 40 candidates. 
Some 250 music lovers from around the world are then instructed to vote for as many as 10 candidates. 
To avoid rock's current hyperbolic publicity machinery, the Hall's lone objective eligibility criterion for a performer is that it be 25 years since his or her first recording. 
The rest is subjective. 
That one objective regulation needs review. 
It offers no special exemption for post-'60s popular artists who've died; no amount of publicity can distort the contributions of Jimi Hendrix, reggae's Bob Marley and country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. 
An innovator like Sly Stone, whose career is as dead as the aforementioned artists, deserves consideration. 

   Another gripe: The pre-rock pioneers are apparently limited to three inductees a year; this year's were country-and-western singer/songwriter Hank Williams, swing and rhythm-and-blues singer and composer Louis Jordan, and T-Bone Walker, the bluesman. 
Last year the nod went to Jimmy Yancey, Jimmy Rodgers and Robert Johnson. 
There was no reason, save mathematical symmetry, to prevent Gene Krupa, the original rock 'n' roll drummer, guitar-solo stylists like Chet Atkins and Wes Montgomery, or bluesman Willie Dixon from getting in sooner rather than later, and long before Mr. Haley and Mr. Nelson. 
A similar unnecessary limited-number rule affects membership for rock businessmen. 

   Of course, the performers provide the glitz, and that's where the Hall of Fame concentrates its promotional efforts. 
It decided to induct 15 performers this year, and its list of superluminaries ran short two-thirds of the way there. 
So Mr. Nelson, the perennial Boy Next Door, went in alongside legends B.B. King and Jackie Wilson. 
The Coasters, whose primary contribution to rock's legacy is the novelty hits "Yakety Yak" and "Charlie Brown," became the first band in the Hall. (Listen to the sax solos in each of those songs; tenorman King Curtis and not the group should have gotten the honor.) 

   Like Mr. Haley, Chubby Checker is known for one hit, but at least "The Twist" was a great, barrel-chested rumble of a vocal. 
Some of the foundation's board members -- mostly record-company executives -- were less than thrilled by the inclusion of musicians whose images were greater than their talent. 
So it's possible that the rock-performers list will be trimmed to five next year. 
Let's see: The Beatles' first record was released 25 years ago. 
So was the Beach Boys'. 
Les Paul and Leo Fender, whose names appear on virtually every electric guitar used during most of rock's first quarter century, are available. 
So is Duane Eddy, an original guitar hero, and Motown's legendary rhythm section of drummer Benny Benjamin and bassist James Jamerson. 
Producer Phil Spector ought to be in. 
Pop songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Doc Pomus and Buck Ram would make good choices. 
So might Tina Turner. 
And there's not a Bill Haley, a Ricky Nelson, in the bunch.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE FROM BON JOVI IN IRVINE 
</P>

Let it never be said that Bon Jovi didn't play with spirit and honest 
directness Saturday night at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was, it wasn't until the encore that those qualities emerged, 
and more than half the band was off stage taking a breather at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of the show was "Ride Cowboy Ride," a simple, straightforward 
acoustic strum-and-harmony number played and sung by leader Jon Bon Jovi and 
guitarist Richie Sambora. 
</P>
<P>
On that number, Bon Jovi dispensed with the flash pots and white phosphorous 
explosions that the band found necessary at several points in the show. It also 
set aside the overdone synthesizer and organ flourishes, the thudding beats and 
the metal-guitar whinnying that are the staples of the Bon Jovi sound. It was 
just two guys singing into a microphone together with a lot of heart and 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The moment proved fleeting: Sambora, backed by wind machine synthesizer 
effects, was soon off on a mannered, portentous acoustic guitar snooze that led 
into "Wanted Dead or Alive." But a good, tough run-through of "Bad Medicine" -- 
the show's second and last highlight -- put a decent cap on things. 
</P>
<P>
There were no such peaks during the body of the concert. Bon Jovi churned out 
routine arena rock, filtered through a murky sound mix. Songs like "Wild in the 
Streets" and "Blood on Blood" found this multiplatinum New Jersey band 
recycling Springsteenesque themes of comradeship and singing with a Bruce-like 
husk. But those songs were overblown and formulaic. 
</P>
<P>
Bon Jovi (which headlines the Forum on Tuesday and Wednesday) seems to have its 
eye on some of the musical roots that underlie Springsteen's music and other 
rock traditions apart from pop-metal. The show included brief snippets of "Save 
the Last Dance for Me" and "Walk Away Renee," as well as instrumental allusions 
to the O'Jays' "For the Love of Money" and Eric Clapton's pomp-and-circumstance 
arrangement of "Little Wing" by Jimi Hendrix. Mostly though, it sounded as if 
Bon Jovi were trying to speak a language without fully knowing yet what it 
means. 
</P>
<P>
Opening band Skid Row's front man, Sebastian Bach, spoke a language that can't 
be printed. The Jersey metal band's set was a poorly sung, indifferently played 
recitation of nearly every bad-boy rocker cliche. Skid Row likes to claim an 
affinity for "the street." Indeed, this obnoxious band had as much originality 
and personality as a slab of asphalt.

<TEXT>
   Grammy-winning guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan
was remembered upon his death Monday for his rocking Texas
roadhouse blues style and his contributions to the music scene
here, where he got his musical start.
   Vaughan, 35, died in a helicopter crash early Monday in
Wisconsin after performing with rock star Eric Clapton and
guitarist, Robert Cray.
   ``He was a great musician and a very good friend,'' Cray said.
``I'm shocked at what happened.''
   ``He played the blues like he wanted to play to blues, he played
and put blues in places that we, even Muddy Waters, didn't do,''
said blues guitarist Buddy Guy, who performed with Vaughn, Cray and
Clapton on Sunday.
   ``We'll miss Stevie and we'll miss his music,'' said Jeff
Peterson of the PBS-TV program ``Austin City Limits,'' which has
featured Vaughan and his band, Double Trouble.
   Also killed in the crash near East Troy, Wis., were the pilot
and Clapton's agent, a tour manager and a bodyguard.
   Vaughan, who overcame a drug problem to win two Grammy awards,
gained popularity in the middle 1980s with his guitar jamming and
blues sound, borrowed from such music legends as B.B. King.
   ``The loss is a great loss for blues music and all fans of music
around the world,'' King said in a statement. ``He was just
beginning to be appreciated and develop his potential.''
   Vaughan toured this summer with blues singer Joe Cocker and was
to release a new record in September with his brother Jimmie,
another well-known musician who formed The Fabulous Thunderbirds
band.
   ``This is the worst accident to happen to Texas music since
Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper went down in the '50s. It's a void
no one can fill,'' said Casey Monahan, director of the Texas Music
Office.
   In 1959, a plane carrying carrying singers J.P. (The Big Bopper)
Richardson, Buddy Holly and Richie Valens crashed in Iowa. Holly
was from Texas.
   ``There's not an individual in Austin who's not proud of Stevie
and what he's done for us and Austin music. It's tragic for his
fans, his family, everybody,'' said Ernie Gammage, head of the
Austin Music Industry Council.
   Vaughan had a platinum album with Double Trouble in ``Couldn't
Stand the Weather,'' released in 1984. That same year, he won a
Grammy for best traditional blues recording for the song ``Texas
Flood.'' It was on a album featuring several blues artists and
entitled ``Blues Explosion.''
   He won a 1990 Grammy in the contemporary blues category for ``In
Step.''
   Born Stephen Ray Vaughan on Oct. 3, 1954, in Dallas, he began
playing the guitar at age 7, copying his older brother Jimmie. The
two had been working on an album for September release called
``Family Style.''
   In a recent interview, Jimmie Vaughan recalled Stevie's early
interest in music: ``It was my guitar and my records. When I left,
I would say, `Don't touch my guitar because I'm going to get you.
Leave my guitar alone.' And of course, when I would leave, he would
go straight in there and play with my guitar and try to learn what
I had been playing.''
   At 13, Stevie Ray Vaughan began playing in Dallas clubs before
quitting school before his senior year. He moved to Austin in 1972,
returning to Dallas in 1986.
   In addition to his brother, Vaughan is survived by his mother,
Martha.
   A candlelight vigil was planned for Austin's Zilker Park on
Monday night. The Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas planned to play his
music in tribute all day.

A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of English classical guitarist 
Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100, a world auction record for the 
instrument, Sotheby's said. 
</P>
<P>
The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday by a Japanese 
dealer whose name was not available. The previous record was $18,900 paid in 
1974 for a south German guitar made in 1624. Bream has said he plays his 
guitars for two years and then likes to sell them for others to play. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far more money. One 
owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for $322,000.

<P>
On a balmy Tuesday night earlier this month, 250 people filed cheerfully into 
Ojai's Matilija Junior High School auditorium. They were a folk music crowd -- 
thirtyish and open-collared -- and they sat on hard wooden seats, facing a 
stage adorned with fiddle, guitar, Autoharp, piano and hammered dulcimer. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had come for John McCutcheon, the Virginia-based performer whose 
tools these were, but also for the tools themselves: Traditional musical 
instruments, challenged in the marketplace by high-technology these past few 
years, have come through as popular as ever in Ventura County and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have ended up like you," McCutcheon told the audience as he fingered 
his banjo. "I got good grades in school and all that. But I started playing the 
banjo, and everything started going to hell from then on." He was smiling, of 
course, and many in the crowd were smiling back. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I first heard Pete Seeger," McCutcheon, 37, said in an 
interview a few days before. "It was inviting, like saying, 'You can do this.' 
He never said that, but the message was there. 'You've got this wooden box with 
strings across it. And you can make music on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That sense of invitation still exists. Since 1987, musical instrument merchants 
nationwide have reported a resurgence in sales for unamplified instruments from 
guitars to drums. In 1988, the last year for which figures are available, an 
American Music Conference survey showed that acoustic guitar sales were up 26%. 
Bowed string instrument sales -- including violins, cellos and basses -- were 
up 12%. Percussion and wind instrument sales also rose, but less dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports followed several flat years in the mid-1980s, when many consumers 
were drawn to a new crop of electronic keyboard instruments and electric 
guitars. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the recording industry has found ready audiences for such 
acoustically oriented artists as singer-guitarist Tracy Chapman and 
singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby. Windham Hill Records, the Palo Alto "New Age" 
record label that was founded 14 years ago, reports annual sales of $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a revival in folk music, really," said Becky Lowe, who with her 
husband, Tom, has been presenting folk concerts around Ojai for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Lowes, who said they pass any profits along to the performers, organized 
McCutcheon's concert. In March, they brought a New England folk trio named 
Matamora to the Ojai Woman's Club and drew about 100 paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, the Lowes will again occupy the Woman's Club, this time to present 
Figgy Duff, a Newfoundland sextet that at various times employs accordion, 
harmonica, bouzouki (a mandolin-like instrument that originated in Greece), 
fiddle, guitar, hammered dulcimer, bodhran, flute, whistles, concertina, harp, 
keyboards and electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, the City Bakery presents occasional acoustic performances. On April 
27, folk singers Fred Starner and Larry Penn will play there. The cover charge 
is $3. On June 2, an appearance by the local group Acoustic Medicine is 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians can't always take this new interest to the bank; several local 
observers say they haven't noticed any particular increase audiences for 
acoustic concerts. But an unscientific local survey suggests that the acoustic 
revival has not left Ventura County behind. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars continue to outsell acoustics 2-to-1 at McCabe's Music in 
Santa Paula, by the estimate of clerk Marco Avelino, and a salesman estimated 
that acoustic guitar sales were up only slightly at Henson's Music Center in 
Oxnard. But at Henson's Music Center in Camarillo and Heck Music Center in 
Ventura, the story is different. 
</P>
<P>
"We are selling quite a few more acoustic guitars than we did, say, two years 
ago," said Andy Feldman, assistant manager at Henson's in Santa Paula. "I would 
say I sell three acoustics to every electric. Two years ago, it was probably 
two electrics to one acoustic." 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy Chapman came up," said saleswoman Daphne Jones at Heck Music Center, 
"and all of a sudden everybody was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Nadine Bunn, co-owner of Folk Mote Music in Santa Barbara -- which sells no 
electric instruments -- reports that her store's sales in the second half of 
1989 were up 15% over the second half of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chapman, a co-founder of the Old Time Fiddlers' Assn. in Ojai, estimates 
that the group's membership -- 380 players and enthusiasts -- has grown by 75 
or more in the last two years. From 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. on the second and fourth 
Sundays of every month, the association takes over the Oak View Community 
Center on Valley Road for jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of interest," said Seabury Gould, an Ojai guitarist and 
keyboard player who has been performing and teaching in Ventura County for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the signs of a good musician is that you can unplug him and he still 
sounds good," Gould said. "If a musician is completely relying on electronics, 
something is wrong. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McCutcheon started his set in the auditorium with a song about trains, 
suggesting somehow a train whistle with his banjo-picking. 
</P>
<P>
"And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow," he sang. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

MAYALL PROVIDES A WELCOME DOSE OF AUTHENTICITY

<P>
After a week of media immersion in Milli Vanilli's fudging, it was a relief to 
hunker down with some certified-honest goods Friday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. Real roots. Real guitars. Real harmonica. 
Real singing. Oh yes, and some lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
Lip-syncing!!! Et tu, Mayall? 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry, folks. The blues republic hasn't fallen. When it comes to 12-bar 
traditionalism, Mayall is still the noblest Briton of them all. This was honest 
lip-syncing -- a fun bit of musical ventriloquism in which guitarist Coco 
Montoya played a mouth-flapping Charlie McCarthy while his sweet Stratocaster 
made like Edgar Bergen. While his fingers elicited deep, masculine harrumphs 
and falsetto female protestations from the guitar, Montoya's lips silently 
mimicked a couple in the midst of an animated domestic tiff. 
</P>
<P>
The humor went down well with the near-capacity crowd, and so did the more 
serious, high-impact fretwork that Montoya displayed during the rest of his 
long solo spot. The fact that the guitarist got the biggest ovation of the 
nearly two-hour show called to mind another Mayall tradition: The bandleader's 
long career has been as much a forum for his guitar-hero sidemen as for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the latest Bluesbreakers lineup, which also includes bassist 
Freebo and a very solid drummer, Joe Yuele, has Mayall steppin' out a bit more 
than he did during the mid- to late '80s. During those years, Mayall's band was 
a five-piece with two dominant guitarists, Montoya and Walter Trout. The 
Huntington Beach-based Trout left in 1989 to front his own band full time. 
Rather than replace him, Mayall went on with a four-piece lineup, giving 
himself more room to move, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
Mayall, who turns 57 on Thursday, moved with plenty of good-natured vigor as he 
blew lots of harmonica, played some nice chingy-jangly rhythm guitar and took 
extended glides along his digital keyboard, which alternately sounded like an 
organ and a piano (not to mention some passable flute tones and some 
too-gimmicky ersatz sax). But the concert was mainly a low-keyed, easygoing 
affair that could have used more of a jolt. While it rolled along enjoyably, it 
lacked the searing, emotive moments that can turn a blues show from an amiable, 
toe-tapping night out into something more intense and revealing. 
</P>
<P>
The material may have had something to do with that. Mayall drew most of it 
from his current album, "A Sense of Place," a collection of swampy, down-home 
tunes with a prevailing back-porch blues feel. Having recently regained 
major-label status after a long spell of recording for small companies, Mayall 
clearly wasn't in a mood for looking back. He opened with "All Your Love," from 
the classic 1965 "Bluesbreakers" album, and closed with his signature 
harp-riffer, "Room to Move." In between, everything but Montoya's spotlight 
number was drawn from Mayall's two recent Island Records releases. That wasn't 
a real problem, because the material on "A Sense of Place" and the 1988 album, 
"Chicago Line," is varied and stands up well. But Mayall could have profitably 
resurrected one or two early songs in place of a number like "Congo Square," a 
voodoo-themed New Orleans piano strut that didn't come close to replicating the 
distinctive bounce and roll of such native New Orleans players as Art Neville 
and Dr. John. Mayall played to a stronger suit with the old-time barrelhouse 
piano style of "Send Me Down to Vicksburg." 
</P>
<P>
Mayall's singing also failed to summon up the psychological drama of the 
highest-intensity blues. With its high, reedy, cottony quality, Mayall's voice 
is distinctive enough to be readily identifiable, but it is far from trenchant. 
</P>
<P>
On "Sensitive Kind," in which the singer counsels another man to deal tenderly 
and considerately with women, Mayall's mild delivery made the advice sound 
temperate, almost fatherly. It was left to Montoya to raise the emotional 
stakes. After underscoring the tender mood, and women's sadness, with 
cushioned, string-massaging tones, he moved to taut, rapid runs that elevated 
the drama. 
</P>
<P>
Mayall's encore offered a nice treat: a guitar duet (as opposed to duel) 
between Montoya and Debbie Davies, whose band had opened with a solid hour 
given mainly to blues standards that showcased her clean, nimble guitar style. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya and Davies live together, and they played together with fine 
responsiveness. At one point, the left-handed Montoya let loose with a flying 
speed run. In many circumstances, the next player up would take that as a 
challenge, a feat to be duplicated or outdone. Instead, Davies chose to play 
something contrasting and complementary -- some chunky, rhythmic Chuck Berry 
licks. The interlude ended with a tandem harmony passage that made you think 
that love really is grand, especially when two sharp guitar players are 
expressing it together. 
</P>
<P>
Having gotten Vanilli goo all over itself, the recording arts academy that runs 
the Grammy Awards would do well to look toward Mayall for a much-needed helping 
of musical authenticity. In the quite possible event that "A Sense of Place" is 
nominated in the category of best contemporary blues recording, the Grammys 
should can the lip-sync brigade and turn over a good chunk of its telecast to 
Mayall and his eminent alumni association (the leading lights being Eric 
Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood). Since 1990 
marks the 25th anniversary of "Bluesbreakers," the first great blues-rock 
guitar album, it would make a lot of sense.

GUITARIST COOKS UP ECLECTIC, ELECTRIC BREW; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: BILL FRISELL IS BEING HAILED AS A GUITAR HERO FOR THE 1990S. HIS 
WIDE-RANGING REPERTOIRE BLENDS THE INFLUENCES OF MANY MUSICIANS.

<P>
The sound of his electric guitar probes through space like some futuristic 
laser weapon. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Bill Frisell, who plays Elario's tonight at 8 and 10, has merged 
influences from Wes Montgomery, Jim Hall, Jimi Hendrix, country-Western and 
be-bop into a fresh, eclectic brew that has critics hailing the emergence of a 
guitar hero for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell is revered among music reviewers. Nearly every project he touches rates 
five stars, whether it's jazz with drummer Paul Motian, whacked out make overs 
of movie music with saxophonist John Zorn's band, Naked City, or five albums of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
His newest recording, "Is That You," includes only drummer Joey Baron from 
Frisell's regular band. The music consists of nine originals plus warped 
versions of the Aretha Franklin hit "Chain of Fools" and Henry Mancini's movie 
theme, "The Days of Wine and Roses." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell's last album with his band was the 1989 "Before We Were Born." Like 
Frisell's playing, the instrumentation presents a new twist. Baron and Kermit 
Driscoll hold down traditional drums and bass positions, but cellist Hank 
Roberts adds unusual new colors. 
</P>
<P>
"He can cover such a wide range of functions," Frisell explained. "He can play 
bass (parts). Or play in the melody range where I am, or in the middle. So his 
function can be almost anything. That's actually true of everyone in the band. 
Kermit can play melodies, and Joey even plays some melodies on drums. 
</P>
<P>
"But more than the instrumentation, it's the person that I choose. Musically we 
relate on a high level, but we're also close friends. That's true with everyone 
in the band. I've been playing with Hank and Kermit since 1975. The band didn't 
really start until five years ago, but I played a lot with them over the years, 
so we already had a pretty strong connection." 
</P>
<P>
Always in search of freshness and spontaneity, Frisell includes little of his 
past material in his live shows with the group. Instead, he is using this tour, 
which opened Oct. 3 in Oakland, to develop music for an album he plans to 
record later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to play something new just about every day," Frisell said. "We're 
recording in the middle of this tour, and I want to do it very quickly and have 
it represent what the band is like live." 
</P>
<P>
Besides averaging an album a year of his own, Frisell keeps busy playing a 
variety of other sessions. In the past, these have included albums with Living 
Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, Power Tools (including drummer Ronald Shannon 
Jackson), saxophonist Jan Garbarek, bassist Eberhard Weber and drummer Billy 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, Frisell will work with Motian on an album of music by the late 
pianist Bill Evans. And a new album with Zorn is due early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned is a session pairing the risk-taking Frisell and such longtime 
associates as bassist Charlie Haden with saxophonist David Sanborn, whose music 
has generally had a broader, more commercial appeal than Frisell's. The meeting 
could bring new listeners to Frisell while expanding Sanborn's musical 
horizons. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another album will feature Frisell with clarinetist Don Byron. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Frisell originally set out to be a clarinetist himself. He played the 
horn seriously through high school in Denver, and only goofed around on guitar 
as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
In the late sixties, he heard Montgomery for the first time and began thinking 
more seriously about the guitar. He played clarinet through two years of 
studying music at the University of Northern Colorado, then hooked up with 
guitar instructor Dale Bruning, who exposed him to the jazz of Charlie Parker, 
Monk and Hall, all important influences. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell saw Hendrix in concert twice during the late '60s, but wasn't hit with 
the full impact of the music until years later: the inventive uses of echo and 
feedback, the slithering jazz-based runs, the slurred, plaintive blues cries. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more impressed with the fact that he was destroying his equipment," 
Frisell said. "The whole sound was so radical, it's taken a long time for 
people to figure out what he was doing. I wasn't that far along in my playing 
at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Some young guitarists start out playing rock and gravitate later toward jazz, 
but Frisell took a different path. From 1969 to 1974, he was dedicated to jazz, 
even though a part of him wanted to follow in Hendrix' tracks. That part came 
out of the closet for good in 1975, when Frisell heard fellow guitarist Mark 
Miller playing loud and aggressively in a small club, crossing freely between 
jazz, rock and other forms. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing that happened to me is I became open to any kind of 
music," Frisell said. "I always feel uncomfortable with labels and categories. 
I don't think they're very healthy. A few years ago, I figured out it was all 
potentially good. Rather than saying I'm rock or jazz, I don't know what to 
call it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell completed a program in music at the Berklee School of Music in Boston 
during the mid-1970s, then lived in Belgium for a year, recording his first 
album with German bassist Weber. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Frisell has played on nearly 50 albums. Yet, because his music is so 
unconventional, he gets virtually no exposure on commercial radio and remains 
relatively unknown to a large number of music fans. 
</P>
<P>
On this tour, he is playing many cities across the country for the first time, 
including San Diego. While he might spy some curious expressions on the faces 
of people hearing his music for the first time, he doesn't pay much attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more focused on the playing, the guys in the band. I definitely feel the 
energy the audience is putting out. I guess I get it more from what people tell 
me later. Someone will come up to me and say that when we started out, they 
didn't know what was going on, but then they got into it. If people give the 
music enough time, keep an open mind and listen to it a whole night, they 
usually end up liking it."

<LEADPARA>  IF THE electric guitar could be considered a vehicle for artistic expression,
Eric Johnson could rightfully be called the Chuck Yeager of all guitardom. The
Austin, Texas, virtuoso has devoted his career to proving just how far a
vintage Fender Strat and a Marshall amp will go -- without most of the digital
doodads of the '90s.;    "To me, it's a challenge to make the guitar an
interesting, intelligent instrument," Johnson said, in a phone call this week
from a Redding motel. (Johnson and his four-piece band are halfway through a
circuitous West Coast tour that will bring them to San Jose State University's
Event Center tonight.)  </LEADPARA>

ANOTHER GUITAR MASTER NAMED ERIC  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It's sort of a yard tool, like something you dug out of a shed, ya know?
There's a real dichotomy of elegance and rawness there -- and to take this
thing that some people perceive to be a crude implement and craft something
delicate and beautiful with it . . . it's very rewarding," he said.;   
Johnson is a player's player. When other guitarists get to talking about pure
skill and musicianship, the name that comes up with increasing frequency is
his. Last year, the readers of Guitar Player magazine voted him "best overall
guitarist." It was the latest in a string of Guitar Player awards that began
in '86, when he was named "best new guitarist.";    Lately, Johnson is also
earning accolades far beyond the tight ranks of his fellow players. In
February, his current album, "Ah Via Musicom," was nominated for a Grammy in
the "best rock instrumental performance" category. It was the second Grammy
nomination in two albums' time.;    While the 36-year-old hotshot may still
look like an 18-year-old Tom Petty, his career dates back to the early '70s,
when he worked with a local Austin group called Mariani. "I did other things a
couple of times -- cleaned office buildings and was even a carpenter for two
days. But by the time I was 19, this was my true profession," he said.;   
"There was a period around 1980 when I got out of the whole scene for a couple
years. I was just very disillusioned with the process of getting my music
heard. It was Guitar Player's support and the 'Austin City Limits'
(television) show in '84 that really turned my career around. I'd just been
turned down by every major label in the country. And after the show aired . .
. it was like night and day.";    Johnson was signed to Reprise in '85. The
next year, his debut album, "Tones," was nominated for a Grammy in the "best
rock instrumental" category.;    After Reprise decided not to exercise an
option for a second album, Johnson eventually signed with Cinema Records, a
small label expressly designed to market new acts to consumers who had tuned
out of rock when the "progressive" rock genre of the mid-'70s waned. Cinema
chief Denny Somach was looking for new faces to appeal to the 25- to
49-year-old crowd who grew up on groups such as Pink Floyd, Genesis and Yes.
Cinema eventually became an in-house production company for giant Capitol
Records.;    After more than a year of work, Johnson's Capitol debut, "Ah Via
Musicom," hit the stores in March 1990. Amazingly, the self-produced, mostly
instrumental disc got heavy airplay on mainstream album-oriented rock outlets.
Although Capitol promotions staffers offered instrumental tracks from
"Musicom" to "new age" radio, they say few stations have added the songs so
far.;    Over the course of just two albums, Johnson has earned a reputation
as something of an obsessive character in the studio. When it comes to his
quest for the perfect, pure tone, no amount of time is too much, and no detail
is too small.;    Johnson said he decided to produce "Musicom" himself rather
than go with a more experienced producer, because he had a very specific
vision of what he wanted: "There's an entire range of producers -- from people
who insist on total control to those who just accommodate whatever an artist
wants. I wanted to do a record where I could push myself to that arena of
perfection. It's like an artist painting a picture -- some want to make each
stroke themselves; others want another hand to steady the brush. There's
nothing wrong with either way.";    Johnson said his next album, which he's
writing now, will include a sharp turn toward a more spontaneous, live sound.
For a player-producer known for demanding near-surgical precision in the
studio, it represents a tremendous leap of faith. "I'd like to experiment with
capturing the spontaneous energy of shows. It's possible we'll even cut half
of the album live in the studio (recording parts simultaneously rather than
sequentially). I have a lot of respect for classical players who can go in and
just do spontaneously -- and do it right -- because their technique is so
perfect.";    Eric Johnson; Where: San Jose State University Event Center,

   A rare poster advertising the Beatles at Hamburg's
Kaiserkeller was sold for $5,950 to an unidentified Japanese
bidding by telephone, Phillips auctioneers said.
   The poster dates from around 1960, advertising performances by
``original rock 'n' roll Bands'' featuring the Beatles and Rory
Storm and his Hurricanes.
   Beatles drummer Ringo Starr played or the Hurricanes before he
joined the Beatles who, like some other British groups, were famous
in West Germany before they made the big time at home.
   The poster made the top price in Wednesday's sale of 283 lots of
pop and rock music memorabilia which totaled $181,000.
   A Fender Stratocaster cream guitar once owned by Sting, former
lead singer of Police, was bought by Warwick Stone of the Hard Rock
Cafe in Los Angeles for $5,500.

ARMATRADING CONDUCTS HER FAMILIAR RITUAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sneak into the Wiltern Theatre today and you may still be able to see Joan 
Armatrading's smile hanging Cheshire Cat-like, left over from her concert on 
Wednesday. Her grin is one of the brightest around, an infectious display of 
pearly whites that opens up at the slightest show of affection from her fans. 
</P>
<P>
And Wednesday -- as usual -- the affection for her poured forth freely. Her 
cult following, built through an 18-year recording career, is among the most 
loyal and appreciative in pop, even if it hasn't expanded. That underscored the 
pluses and minuses of this show. On the up side, Armatrading treated her fans 
to a greatest-hits selection of quality material. On the down side, it was 
pretty much the same concert experience she has been offering for the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Such thematic touchstones as "I'm Lucky," "Love and Affection" and the standard 
show-closer "Willow" are indispensable, but they've become predictable and 
ritualistic parts of the show. Songs from her fine new "Hearts and Flowers" 
album were relegated to secondary status in the two-hour-plus set. And most of 
the older numbers were played by her five-piece band in soul-reggae-folk-rock 
arrangements hardly varying from the original recordings. 
</P>
<P>
What could Armatrading do? First of all, play more electric guitar. The few 
times she strapped on her Stratocaster the music really came alive, especially 
for the rocking encore one-two of "Me Myself I" and "Ma-Me-O Beach." But more 
to the point, she has got the kind of audience that will follow her anywhere; 
she should take more advantage of that opportunity. STEVE HOCHMAN

<TEXT>
   Stevie Ray Vaughan had all the makings of a blues
legend: a kid from Texas practicing the moves in front of a mirror;
overnight success; comparisons to Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King and Eric
Clapton; the last of the guitar heros playing his heart out.
   Only one part remained for Vaughan, 34, to complete the story,
join Hendrix, Robert Johnson, Mike Bloomfield and others by dying
young. Three years ago, he nearly did.
   ``This might sound funny, but fortunately I collapsed,'' said
Vaughan, who named his new album, ``In Step,'' after the ``12
Steps'' program used by recovering alcoholics.
   ``In a sense, I knew this thing was coming, I knew I couldn't
keep going the way it was. I had a nervous breakdown, I was throwing
up blood, the whole thing. I had not been able to obtain any drugs
for about two weeks, but the drinking was still going on. If I was
awake I was guzzling something,'' he said.
   ``We'd been touring, doing all kinds of things. I went through a
divorce; I couldn't write during that. I wanted to, but divorces are
sick. People don't treat people like people. Lawyers get together
and try to trick each other.''
   The first steps of ``12 Steps'' _ modesty, a sense of limits _
were once a million miles away for Vaughan. On and off stage, he
felt invincible, the baddest kid on the block.
   He could play anything, cover any song, and write his own as
well. From the swirling, Hendrix-like guitar that kicked off his
1983 debut album, ``Texas Flood,'' Vaughan was a sensation, a
throwback to rock's simpler days. Music magazines honored him, so
did the Grammys, making Vaughan an almost automatic nomination for
best rock instrumental.
   ``I didn't know what Grammys were growing up,'' he said. ``The
radio I listen to has more to do with soul stations that don't
necessarily play all the new stuff. I don't really care to get into
any formula: `If you play the game our way, we'll play your stuff.'
''
   Those first records, in every way, were a blur. Vaughan and his
band, Double Trouble, quickly followed his debut album with
``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' ``Soul to Soul'' and ``Live Alive,''
all gold sellers.
   Unafraid of comparisons, Vaughan covered Hendrix's ``Voodoo
Chile,'' Buddy Guy's ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' and Willie Dixon's
``You'll Be Mine.'' The slow songs _ Jimmy Reed's ``Tin Pan Alley,''
Vaughan's own ``Lenny'' _ were a release, temporary mercy, a long
sigh of relief.
   He lived and breathed the blues, and almost died.
   ``I thought I was real cool because I was higher than you and you
didn't know what you're missing. I was aware I had many big
problems, I could not stop and didn't know how,'' he said.
   ``I was addicted to people that I wasn't treating like people. I
was treating people like drugs, too. If there was somebody that
would put up with anything, that was fine. Luckily, there were
people who still cared.''
   Now preaching sobriety in his private life, Vaughan still
worships the blues on record. For ``In Step,'' he covers Howlin'
Wolf's ``Love Me Darlin','' Buddy Guy's ``Leave My Girl Alone,'' and
Willie Dixon's ``Let Me Love You Baby,'' drawing material from his
substantial record collection.
   ``They're like my books, like my school,'' Vaughan said. ``You
put it on and it hits you. It's always been that way.
   ``I can take just about any one of my records and if something
about the way they play or sing gets a hold of me, I'll try to find
what they did. I'll wrestle with myself playing their stuff for a
while and I'll absorb it into my own sound.''
   He ends ``In Step'' with ``Riviera Paradise,'' a lengthy jazz
instrumental he wrote in 1984.
   ``It's an extension of sorts of the same style as `Lenny.' In my
heart and in my mind, they were written for the same reason, to
soothe. It had to come out at the end of the record, I couldn't see
any other place for it, really.''
   Vaughan, who once dreamed of playing like bluesman Albert King,
now finds himself being approached by young guitarists, all just
beginning their own stories.
   ``Some of them want to know technical things, some of them want
to know what to do, how to go about getting a record deal. I can
just tell them who I listen to, what I did,'' he said.
   ``I remember when the biggest thing in my life was getting to
meet B.B. King. I thought, in my mind, it was not only important for
me, but important for him. I had all this confidence. It was
incredible seeing somebody who was such a gentleman. I've been so
fortunate to meet all these people.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Harold Bradley Played and Played and Played</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NS1 of Aug. 28.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Sissy Spacek, after recording the
soundtrack to the 1980 movie ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' handed
guitar player Harold Bradley a note.
   ``Pick them strings, guitar man. Loved working with you,'' it
said.
   Bradley did pick. And pick. And pick.
   In the city known worldwide for its guitar players, Bradley has
been the most productive. Chet Atkins is more famous, and Roy Clark
helped popularize the term ``picker,'' but Bradley has been more
prolific.
   In a career spanning 43 years, the 63-year-old Bradley has played
in literally thousands of recording sessions. No one in Nashville,
perhaps no one else anywhere, comes close to matching his output.
   ``My career sounds like a lie, but it's really happened,''
Bradley says calmly in a manner that belies the fervor with which he
plays.
   Twelve of the records on which he played with Elvis Presley
became million-sellers. Just a few of the other singers he's
accompanied include Willie Nelson, Marie Osmond, Roger Miller,
Loretta Lynn, John Davidson, Patsy Cline, Tom Jones, Buddy Holly,
the Everly Brothers, Hank Williams, Conway Twitty, Charley Pride and
Joan Baez.
   He's played on movie soundtracks such as ``Pink Cadillac'' and
``Smokey and the Bandit II'' in addition to ``Coal Miner's
Daughter.''
   A few of the songs on which he's played include ``Jingle Bell
Rock,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Stand by Your Man,'' ``I'm Sorry,''
``King of the Road,'' ``It's Such a Pretty World Today'' and ``Make
the World Go Away.''
   For good measure, he played at the White House in 1978,
accompanying country music stars Tom T. Hall, Lynn and Twitty who
were invited by President Carter to provide some down-home
entertainment.
   This illustrious production came from a musician who taught
himself how to play at age 15 and still practices an average of a
couple hours a day. Even at age 45, he briefly took lessons in
classical music.
   ``I love it,'' he says as he approaches a half-century of
plucking the strings. ``I love to practice. You have to practice.
There is no end to being a good guitar player.
   ``It's like you've got this big jigsaw puzzle in front of you.
You put a few pieces in and you get an idea of the picture. Then you
realize there's more pieces on the outside so you keep trying to put
them in. And you realize you can never fill in the whole thing.''
   Bradley, who does not sing, has been enterprising as well as
busy. For sound effects, he once went to his car and got a pair of
tire chains, returned to the studio and dropped them to the floor
during the recording session for the song ``Chain Gang.''
   He has no preference among the various electric or acoustical
guitars, saying simply: ``I prefer what I'm playing at the time. I
like to play all of 'em.''
   An engaging man with volumes of scrapbooks and memorabilia about
his career, Bradley believes versatility has been his helpmate as
much as ability.
   ``I don't know that I am good. But I can offer experience. I've
been very lucky to play a wide variety of music: country, big band,
rock 'n' roll, gospel.
   ``If I played one kind, I wouldn't have been around this long. If
I was a rock 'n' roll specialist, they would not have needed me on
other recordings that required different abilities.''
   He also plays other instruments, joking that ``I play two in
self-defense, the banjo and mandolin.''
   He says his biggest thrills are those indescribable moments when
musicians combine for special sounds in the studio.
   ``When something magic happens, you get a tremendous high. You
can't turn creativity off and on like water. I've enjoyed that
several times with several artists where it was such a marvelous
music experience that you felt something great happened.''
   Bradley feels that he is still getting better except for his rock
'n' roll playing.
   ``To do that, you have to go out and play it,'' he said. ``And I
play a certain style, rockabilly style, pretty good. But to go out
and play like Van Halen and those guys, no, I'll never do that. But
he'll never come here and play the guitar, the bass guitar, the
banjo, the mandolin, the ukulele. So it's kind of a tradeoff.
   ``What you're buying if you buy me is experience and intonation
and ability. But even that can't guarantee a hit record. The public
decides that.''

   When Tracy Chapman played her Grammy-winning
song, ``Fast Cars,'' on this year's awards show, she did more than
just herald the return to folk-pop: She championed the acoustic
guitar.
   After a decade or so of synthetic sounds, the acoustic guitar is
making a comeback. The Traveling Wilburys play acoustics while
singing songs off their platinum LP. And Tom Petty's new record is
full of songs written on 6-string and 12-string acoustics.
   Chapman played a Martin guitar _ built by C.F. Martin &amp; Co. in
Nazareth, Pa. It is a handmade instrument constructed with care.
   ``I wrote and thanked her that night,'' said company chairman
Christian F. Martin IV, whose great-great-grandfather founded the
company in 1833.
   At the company's plant, 90 craftsmen carefully perform by hand
the nearly 300 steps necessary to turn Indian rosewood, Amazon
Mahogany and Hawaiian koa into an instrument. Another 100 make the
strings for the instrument.
   The work is time-consuming. The wood is aged up to six months in
the climate-controlled work area. Almost all of the work is done by
hand, with the pearl inlay taking up to two weeks per guitar.
   From start to finish, it takes three months to build a Martin
guitar.
   Most are Dreadnoughts, a widely copied acoustic instrument named
after a class of World War I British battleships.
   ``Ask someone to draw an acoustic guitar and he'll draw a
Dreadnought,'' Martin said.
   The Dreadnought _ which means ``fear nothing'' _ was designed in
1931 by the company for country-western singers who needed a big,
loud guitar. It is pear-shaped, with an extra wide and deep body to
produce a stronger bass and clearer treble.
   The original design is still the most popular, and Martin said 75
percent of the 8,500 instruments made this year at the plant will be
Dreadnoughts.
   This year, the company introduced its first acoustic bass. Priced
between $2,050 and $2,350, the original allotment of 50 intruments
were almost immediately sold out.
   ``We heard Tracy Chapman bought one the first day it was in the
stores,'' Martin said.
   The company now plans on building 350 this year, but even that
won't fill all the orders. ``We can't just crank up production,''
Martin said.
   But most changes do not catch on. Martin Guitar introduced an
acoustic guitar with a polished black finish. It didn't sell because
musicians wanted the natural wood color.
   ``I thought it would fit with some bands who have outlaw
images,'' Martin said. ``The guitar is thousands of years old.
People wouldn't want us to change it much. They want to buy the
guitar their father bought.''
   After a peak year in 1971 _ when Martin produced 22,627
instruments, the market slowly declined. Electronic instruments
became big in the late 1970s, and the nation suffered a recession,
severely damaging business for the country's acoustic guitarmakers.
   Martin's annual sales fell from $18 million to $12 million, and
the company was forced to close factories in Connecticut and New
York, as well as sell subsidiaries in Sweden and a drum company
called Fibes in nearby Easton, Pa. About 330 of 550 employees were
laid off.
   The business started to turn around in 1985, when some musicians
became tired of the electronic instrument sound. Also, the economy
had rebounded enough that people could afford a Martin _ which runs
between $1,000 and $5,000.
   Then came Susanne Vega's folk hit, ``Luka'' in 1987. She received
three Grammy nominations for her song about child abuse. Then came
Chapman's ``Fast Cars,'' a bracing look at inner-city poverty that
won three Grammys.
   Oddly enough, the company's founder, Christian Frederick Martin,
came to the United States in 1833 because guitars were regarded as a
fad in Germany.
   The Martins had been members of the Cabinet Makers Guild, and
when Christian Martin attempted to set up a guitar-making business,
the Violin Makers Guild attempted to stop him.
   ``They said it was just a fad, but they didn't want him to make
the instruments'' Martin said.
   Although he successfully went to court and won the right to
produce guitars, he decided to leave Germany and come to the United
States.
   He began building guitars in New York City, and was an immediate
success.
   ``That's because the guitar is American,'' Martin said. ``When
people were moving out West, what would they play around the
campfire? The guitar. A piano was too big for them to bring along.''
   Tired of the big city, he moved to Nazareth in northeastern
Pennsylvania, where the company has survived through good and bad
times.
   Even in bad times, there will always be a market for a well-made
guitar, said Martin. ``Some artists won't use anything else.''
   Also, many artists who perform on electric guitars actually
compose on acoustics. The Who's Pete Townshend, who uses one on the
band's current reunion tour, mainly writes on acoustic guitars.
   Still, Martin knows that today's acoustic success can be fleeting.
   ``It's a cyclical business. We don't have the clout to change the
direction of music,'' he said.
   But with some trends, such as the electronic instruments in the
1980s, the later models make the earlier ones obsolete. Guitars,
however, can last forever.
   ``Acoustic instruments get better with time,'' Martin said. ``The
day you buy a guitar is the worst it will sound.''

What a difference 22 years can make. Sixties renegade Gary Burton has become 
'80s mainstreamer Gary Burton. According to vibraphonist Burton, who plays 
Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach this Saturday night, his playing hasn't changed 
that much, just the musical climate around him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I burst on the scene with my own group in 1967, I was considered 
avant-garde, one of the first to combine pop with jazz before the term fusion 
existed. They called us jazz-rock. At the time, that was just what I heard, 
what I wanted to play. I've pursued the same model. I'm open to stylistic 
influences, but I keep the focus on improvisational jazz." 
</P>
<P>
"My rock heroes were Dylan, the Beatles, the Band. My jazz influences during 
the early years were Bill Evans, Jim Hall and the usual famous horn players of 
the day. As I got further along, my big influence over the years has been 
Chick," he said, referring to Chick Corea. Burton has recorded several times 
with that keyboard wizard, and the two have played together at least once a 
year for the past 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Burton also makes a cameo appearance on rock guitarist Eric Clapton's new 
album. The two met in the '60s when they shared a bill at the Fillmore in San 
Francisco, when Clapton was a member of Cream. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change in Burton's music of late has been the replacement of his 
pianist with young Austrian guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel. Burton returns to the 
powerful guitar-vibes combination featured in his '70s bands, with a string of 
guitarists that included Larry Coryell, John Scofield and Pat Metheny. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Don McCaslin is the third melody maker in the band. 
</P>
<P>
"With the three of us capable of handling melodies, and the guitar and vibes 
capable of handling chords, there are a lot of possible combinations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes Wolf and I accompany Donny, sometimes only one of us backs him. We 
also combine on melodies. We orchestrate different ways. The guitar and tenor 
share the melody line, or the vibes and guitar, or all three." 
</P>
<P>
Burton's latest albums include guitarists: a year-old recording with Scofield, 
and an upcoming release with Metheny. 
</P>
<P>
At 46, Burton knows himself and his music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very lyrical, melody-oriented player," said Burton, a prime player on 
the mellow ECM jazz label in the '70s. "I have no political messages. I'm not 
angry. I'm not troubled." 
</P>
<P>
Cross-pollination is blurring the lines between styles of music. Rockers work 
with jazz musicians, rappers hook up with rockers, and Brazilian flavors are in 
with musicians of all stripes. 
</P>
<P>
If the Yellowjackets are any indication, all this crisscrossing is expanding 
the musical horizons of the listening public. Originally pegged as a fusion 
band, the group has charted a jazzier course since drummer Ricky Lawson and 
guitarist Robben Ford were replaced three albums ago by saxophonist Marc Russo 
and drummer William Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
According to bassist Jimmy Haslip, one of two original Yellowjackets along with 
keyboard player Russell Ferrante, fans are are following the new direction with 
interest. The new album, "The Spin," hit No. 1 on the Radio and Records 
contemporary jazz chart, and is still in Billboard's top five. 
</P>
<P>
On "The Spin," the Yellowjackets opted for extended improvisations and simpler 
instrumentation more typical of mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been going in that direction for a while, but this is the first time on 
record," Haslip said. "We've always stretched out live." 
</P>
<P>
Haslip said the band recorded the new album, engineered by ECM genius Jan Erik 
Kongshaug, more like a mainstream jazz session. Songs were played live instead 
of built up instrument by instrument. Overdubbing was kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
So they should easily replicate their recorded sound when they play two shows 
next Wednesday at 7 and 10 p.m. at Mandeville Auditorium at UC San Diego. 
Sharing the bill is Stanley Jordan, whose unusual two-handed tapping technique 
turns a guitar into a veritable orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
France, known for fine wines and cuisine, has exported two other quality 
commodities this century: jazz violinists Stephane Grappelli and Jean-Luc 
Ponty.

Ponty, who has thrilled listeners since the late '60s with his soaring, 
electric melodies, appears Tuesday night at Symphony Hall in downtown San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After learning the instrument from his violinist father, Ponty initially made 
his mark on albums with Frank Zappa and guitarist John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
On his new album, "Storytelling," Ponty uses an unusual five-string violin, but 
the sound still includes the slicing runs and arcing glissandoes that have made 
him the world's best-known jazz violinist.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: SELF-TAUGHT GUITARIST SCOTT HUCKABAY TO STRUM HIS ACOUSTIC 
STUFF AT BEBOP 
</P>

Scott Huckabay was no child phenom. He didn't even pick up a guitar until he 
finished playing with adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hanging around in the basement, when I found this old, thick Spanish 
guitar," said Huckabay, who was 17 at the time. "It suddenly became part of me, 
and I couldn't put it down. I found my thing." 
</P>
<P>
Today, his thing has landed him recognition -- he placed second recently in BAM 
magazine's vote for guitarist of the year. On Thursday, Huckabay, 25, will 
strum his stuff at BeBop Records in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Huckabay, who lives in San Clemente, has never taken a lesson. Since his 
basement discovery, he taught himself everything, graduating from the Spanish 
instrument to an electric guitar to his current acoustic version. After a 
motorcycle accident in Arizona, he used his recuperation period to jam with his 
acoustic guitar. He sees it as his best chance for a career breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much competition in the electric, heavy-metal scene," Huckabay 
said. "But it's still an open market for acoustic players." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Huckabay has only performed instrumental songs; he released a tape on 
his own label, Fresh Ltd. He's written lyrics, but has hesitated to sing them 
at concerts. "I just don't feel I've progressed to that level yet. It will come 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
At BeBop, he will stick to the acoustic guitar. He will also put together a 
light show. "I was never really into rock 'n' roll as a kid," he said. "I'm 
much more into jazz and classical." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Huckabay will play his acoustic guitar at 8 p.m. Thursday, at BeBop 
Records, 18433 Sherman Way, Reseda. Donations are requested. For information, 
call (818) 881-1654. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summer in Santa Monica once again means the outdoor concert series, "Grand 
Summer Nights," which will open July 1 with a country-Western theme. Glen 
Campbell is the featured guest. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-concert series, sponsored by Santa Monica College, will present jazz, 
mariachi and acoustic music. Among the performers will be the Oak Ridge Boys on 
July 15 and Lionel Hampton on Aug. 19. For the first time in the three-year 
event, admission, ranging from $7.50 to $15, will be charged, except the July 1 
event is free. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people complained that they couldn't get in last year," said Gloria 
Mottler, the program coordinator for campus events. "When it was free, people 
would arrive very early and take all the seats." 
</P>
<P>
The July 1 show at Corsair Field will also include displays, booths, free 
children's rides and a fireworks show. Most of the concerts will take place at 
the 1,800-seat college amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Grand Summer Nights" concert series begins at 8 p.m. July 1. For 
information, call (213) 452-9209. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the eighth anniversary of the Southern California Blues Society, a 
concert will be held Saturday at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga. 
The show will feature Junior Wells, who has toured internationally for four 
decades, and Cash McCall, who has played with such artists as Muddy Waters, 
Ramsey Lewis and Etta James. 
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by Blues groups from Los Angeles. Among them will be "The 
Mighty Flyers," a modern, faster-paced music than the traditional Chicago 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to provide a full range of different blues," said Eddie Archer, the 
concert's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebration of the Blues," sponsored by the Southern California Blues 
Society, will take place at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga 
Canyon Blvd., Topanga, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m Saturday. Tickets are $20, $17 in 
advance. For information, call (714) 594-5051.

O.C. POP BEAT: ROBERT LUCAS: A BACK-TO-THE-BASICS BLUESMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

<P>
Traditional blues is difficult to play convincingly, and it certainly isn't one 
of the more financially rewarding branches of music. It's not surprising, then, 
that most of the musicians who play the deep blues say they didn't take it up 
as a matter of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, some compulsion in the music pulled them in, ears first. Maybe it was 
the resonance of a quavering slide guitar, or the mystery in a drawled, 
incantatory vocal cry. In any case, something inside answers to the depths of 
history and culture and the wells of elemental emotion embedded in the blues, 
and it sets the listener on a lifetime course. Robert Lucas says that is how it 
happened with him. 
</P>
<P>
At 27, a relative youngster on a local blues scene populated mostly by veterans 
in their 30s and 40s, Lucas has just released his first album, "Across the 
River." For his debut, the Huntington Beach resident recorded the most basic, 
traditional kind of blues there is -- solo, acoustic performances steeped in 
the Delta style that came out of backwoods Mississippi in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who also fronts an electric blues band, Luke &amp; the Locomotives, will 
play a solo show tonight at Cagney's in Huntington Beach, where he is the host 
of a regular "Open Mic Night" every Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is a big man with exceptionally thick fingers and a hulking build. 
Sitting at a front table in Cagney's long, rectangular barroom, he talked about 
the blues in a low, gravelly speaking voice that was a harbinger of the deep, 
full moan that comes out when he sings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky. . . . I got turned on to a Robert Johnson record when I was very 
young," he said. "Actually, (traditional blues) is all I ever wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who grew up in Long Beach, was in his mid-teens, listening to 
blues-based rockers like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix when he came across his 
first acoustic blues song, "Turtle Blues," on the Janis Joplin/Big Brother 
&amp; the Holding Company "Cheap Thrills" album. The song struck him deeply 
enough to trigger a special trip to his local record shop. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas told the shopkeeper that he wanted to find out more about the sound 
behind the Joplin song. "I asked the guy, 'What is this, and why does it sound 
like that? And where can I get more records like this?' " The clerk recommended 
albums by fundamental bluesmen Leroy Carr and Robert Johnson. It was Johnson's 
"King of the Delta Blues Singers," probably the greatest album in any pop 
category, that grabbed Lucas by the ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about blues. I put the record on with a totally blank 
mind, thinking, 'What is this?' The way (Johnson) phrased his words, I never 
heard music with so much feeling. I'd never felt music before, until I heard 
that stuff. There's a certain eeriness. I could actually see myself being 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas rejected all the other pop music of the day (which wasn't that big a 
sacrifice in 1976) and dove into collecting old blues records. "I was pretty 
snobby when I was in high school," he said. "I used to rant and rave about it." 
He took up the guitar for a while, then set it aside and switched to harmonica, 
which remains his primary instrument. At 19, his search for a guitar teacher 
who could show him Robert Johnson-style acoustic slide guitar techniques led 
him to Bernie Pearl, the Long Beach blues band leader and KLON disc jockey. 
Lucas got his lessons, plus a two-year hitch as a harmonica-playing sideman in 
Pearl's band. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to step out as a front man, Lucas joined the Confessors, a R&amp;B band 
whose repertoire included songs by such master soul singers as James Brown, 
Jackie Wilson and Wilson Pickett. "At the time I didn't like (R&amp;B)," Lucas 
said. "I just wanted to play blues, but it helped me get my vocal chops 
together because that stuff is hard to sing." 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1986, he formed Luke &amp; the Locomotives. After three years of busy 
gigging, the band mustered financing to make its first record. But last summer, 
just as it was on the verge of recording, Lucas decided that the music was all 
wrong, fired the entire band and started over from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"The band progressively had turned into a kind of Southern rock band," said 
Lucas, whose vision for Luke &amp; the Locomotives had been a more traditional, 
Texas- and Chicago-blues sound. "No matter what I tried, it always ended up 
sounding like the Allman Brothers, and I didn't want to do that." Firing the 
band "was one of the hardest things I ever did. One of the guitar players 
(Robert Lieberman) had been my friend for 10 years, and we're not really 
friends now, as you can imagine. But the music is more important to me than all 
that buddy-buddy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
During the next two months, Lucas put together a new band of Locomotives -- 
guitarists Paul Bryant and Rick Gould, bassist Al (Bedrock) Bedrosian and 
drummer Bob Ebersol, who goes by the stage name Max Bangwell. All of them are 
at least 10 years older than Lucas. "When I got the new guys," Lucas said, "I 
got people playing just what I wanted them to, without me having to say 
anything to them. It's been the easiest, most stress-free six months of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The changeover period, and a scaled-down performing schedule since then, gave 
Lucas more time to concentrate on solo acoustic performances -- which led to 
"Across The River," a self-financed cassette album that he recorded on a $1,500 
budget in one day, without overdubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like Robert Johnson in the hotel room in San Antonio," Lucas said, 
referring to the ad-hoc circumstances behind the only surviving recording 
sessions of Johnson's career. Lucas' album includes remakes of two of Johnson's 
classics, "Terraplane Blues" and "Crossroads," as well as songs by John Lee 
Hooker, Muddy Waters and Fred McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just me redoing it to see how much I can sound like (Howlin') Wolf or 
Robert Johnson," Lucas said. "This is my interpretation. It's sounding like 
myself and keeping the idiom alive with things that are fresh." The album's 
title track, one of three Lucas originals, is something fresh, a fine blues 
that, in the best tradition of the style, is drawn from real-life observation. 
</P>
<P>
"A girl I knew in high school became addicted to cocaine, and she became a 
prostitute," Lucas said, explaining the song's background. "I'd see her working 
the streets in Compton. Seeing a girl you knew in high school out on Long Beach 
Boulevard flagging down cars to make 20 bucks, it's kind of a sad situation." 
Lucas invested the song with added emotional resonance by writing it from the 
tortured perspective of a man in love with the streetwalker. Like everything 
else on "Across the River," the title song comes across in a voice that sounds 
timeless and ancient -- a throwback to Lucas' original inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas sees the album as a modest first step on a long road toward his goal of 
recording for a high-profile blues specialty label and establishing his band as 
a touring act (Luke &amp; the Locomotives are planning to record early in 
March). "It's part of the dues-paying process," Lucas said. "You've gotta put 
out a couple albums yourself to show 'em you're serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like a major label to come in and say, 'You're going to be the next 
Robert Cray,' but I don't want to have any futile illusions. The whole key to 
doing this for a long time is keeping your attitude right. If you say, 'I'm 
going to be the next John Mayall,' you're setting yourself up for a fall." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with some bill-paying help from his girlfriend, Lucas has been 
earning a living playing the blues since early 1987, when he quit his job as a 
municipal maintenance man for the city of Long Beach. That, he figures, is a 
pretty significant accomplishment in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lucas plays solo tonight (and every Thursday) at 9:30 as host of Open 
Mic Night at Cagney's, 406 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach. 
Information: (714) 960-9318. Lucas also plays solo Tuesday nights from 8 to 11 
at Taka-O, 425 N. El Camino Real, San Clemente. Information: (714) 498-7111. 
Luke &amp; the Locomotives play this Saturday night at Taka-O, and every Sunday 
at Cagney's from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m.

<TEXT>
   It's 11 a.m., an ungodly hour for most musicians
but just right for Eric Clapton _ a good time for cigarettes,
coffee and quiet conversation.
   He leans back in a green easy chair in his Manhattan hotel room,
his right ankle resting on the opposite knee. His face is deeply
tanned, the beard trim, his wavy brown hair brushed back. A black
T-shirt and bluejeans hang loosely from his rock star-skinny body.
   But it's the eyes you really notice _ the unwavering stare, how
the lids cut downwards at sharp angles, the way his brows form a
crease above his nose as he concentrates on what's being said and
considers his response.
   For a man who looks so reserved on stage, Clapton is in person,
surprisingly, a man of many words. He disapproves of asking
questions (bad manners, he says, observing is more his style), but
answers easily, spinning stories of the blues and the business.
   He talks about guitarists: early heroes such as Elmore James and
Buddy Guy, his all-time favorite; contemporaries, Jimi Hendrix and
Duane Allman; and young performers such as Robert Cray, a featured
player on Clapton's most recent album, ``Journeyman.''
   ``When you meet another guitarist, the first thing you do is
compare notes,'' Clapton, 45, explains. ``You find out who he
likes. `Do you like Robert Johnson?' It's a selfish kind of thing,
you always tend to like being around people who like the same
things you do.
   ``It was clear to me that Cray was a real dyed-in-the wool blues
musician. He's also very, very quiet, very aware, very sensitive.''
   There's a good example of the Clapton approach in the Chuck
Berry concert film, ``Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.'' Invited by
organizer Keith Richards, Clapton takes it slow, checking out
Berry, considering what he wants to sing. He eventually settles on
a rare Berry blues, ``Wee Wee Hours,'' and gives a typically
dignified performance.
   ``My attitude's always been to just tread carefully, be seen and
not heard,'' he says. ``When I used to see my heroes as a kid, I
would just watch and listen. It's the same thing when I got to know
them. Like Buddy Guy, I just watch him and I can see that he's
doing the same thing.
   ``He says every time he sees someone playing he learns
something, which is great.''
   For much of his career, Clapton has preferred to be heard and
not seen. He makes videos, but reluctantly, insisting he has no
interest in acting. Those eyes of an eagle were meant for checking
out other guitarists, not working cameras.
   In concert, he doesn't fall to his knees or bump and grind or
run from one end of the stage to the other when walking is so much
easier. It's just not dignified, not how a gentleman would behave.
   ``There's a line on the `Layla' album, `Do you want to see me
crawl across the floor to you?''' Clapton says, referring to ``Bell
Bottom Blues.''
   ``Some people could do that, crawl across the floor on stage. I
couldn't do that. I wouldn't be able to watch myself on TV if I
played like that. That would be embarrassing to me.''
   Clapton was born in 1945 in Ripley, a small town outside of
London. He became interested in music after seeing Jerry Lee Lewis
perform on television and received an acoustic guitar for his 14th
birthday.
   In the early 1960s, he began spending time in London
coffeehouses, listening to such England blues performers as Alexis
Korner, Cyril Davis and ``Long John'' Baldry. He joined his first
blues band, the Roosters, in 1963.
   Clapton earned a wide following in the mid-'60s with John
Mayall's Bluesbreakers and became an international star with Cream
toward the end of the decade.
   On originals such as ``Layla'' and ``I Can't Stand It,'' or
covers of Bobby Bland's ``Further on up the Road'' and Johnson's
``Ramblin' on My Mind,'' Clapton sings of gentlemen pushed to the
limit, down on the floor, their dignity tested by love, lies and
their own jealous hearts.
   ``Lately I've been running on faith. What else can a poor boy
do?'' he asks on ``Running on Faith'' from his ``Journeyman''
album. ``Sadness can't prevail,'' he sings on ``Pretending.''
``Everybody knows that strong love can't fail.''
   His greatest songs have been about despair and renewal, of
lonely years and the presence of the Lord, a walk with the devil's
music for a man who once inspired ``CLAPTON IS GOD'' graffiti on
walls around London.
   In 1970, the loss of faith pushed him to the extremes of
``Layla,'' with its five-alarm guitar riff and vocals that sound
like a man going down in flames.
   It pushed him to an anguished cover of Chuck Willis' ``It's too
Late.'' The original was gentle, the singer sadly resigned to
losing his girl. For Clapton, it's much worse. He's in tears, as if
life itself is slipping away, his fate confirmed by background
yells of ``Oh, she's gone!''
   Despair almost finished him in real life as well. ``Layla''
flopped when it was first released, and when he tried to record an
album with the same musicians the following year, the band fell
apart. Clapton developed a serious heroin addiction that forced him
into virtual seclusion for 2{ years.
   ``The most horrible I sound is when I've been burned out and in
a bad state of mind and bad state of health,'' Clapton says. ``You
have to live with it. If you can be happy with it when you're old,
you've got a much more contented life.''
   A gentleman, Clapton observed is a spiritual soul, and faith
regained brings out his more spiritual side. ``Let It Grow,'' from
his 1974 album ``461 Ocean Boulevard,'' sounds like one long sigh
of relief, an offer of thanks for his own survival. On ``Anything
for Your Love,'' off ``Journeyman,'' he sings of love as salvation,
his guitar lifting the song right off the ground.
   ``There's a yearning quality to it,'' he says, ``a spiritual
striving there that all musicians attain to. It's just inherent in
what you to, trying to achieve that which you couldn't really
achieve.''
   Muddy Waters, the great bluesman with whom Clapton became close
in the late 1970s, once spoke of the importance of being a
gentleman, and not the kind with a hat and cane: ``You don't have
to have a white face to be a gentleman and up to date with what
you're doing. You can be black, brown or any other color, but
you've got to carry yourself in a way that people know that you're
it.
   ``They might say I can't play or I can't sing, but, damn it,
they'll say I was a gentleman.''
   Clapton agreed, explaining the challenges of compressing a
lifetime of thoughts and feelings into five restless fingers.
   ``I think it has something to do with grace, being graceful in
your life as much as you can be. What happens is that no matter
what you play, it's a reflection of what you are.
   ``So if you live in a state of grace and dignity, it'll come out
in what you're playing. I'm starting to realize what I'm doing now
has to be good enough to be happy with in 20 years' time.''
