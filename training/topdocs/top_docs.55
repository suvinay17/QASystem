    People at Wild Acres have a
penchant for meetings.
   Wild Acres is a lovely 3,000-acre retreat near this community in the Pocono Mountains.
It once was the property of a reputed New York mafioso, the late Michael D'Alessio.
He and his associates, says a Pennsylvania lawman, "used to go out in a boat and hold meetings in the middle of the lake where nobody could overhear."

   While mobsters are still drawn to the Poconos, other people hold meetings, too.
Among them are hundreds who say they were fleeced when they bought small lots at Wild Acres for vacation and retirement homes.

   These aren't people who aspire to lavish weekend living and can recoup any losses by engaging in a little takeover arbitrage.
They are middle-class families of civil servants, small-business men, teachers and corporate spear carriers who have worked and saved for years to fulfill the dream of a house in the country.

   In all, about 2,200 lots were sold.
The purchasers of more than 1,000 of them now have built that house in the country, but many of these find themselves disturbed by the way privately managed Wild Acres is run.
The purchasers of at least 250 of the remaining lots have a worse problem: Because of action by state environmental authorities, they can't build at all on their properties, which cost them an estimated $3.6 million.

   They have complained to federal and state agencies and have received advice, sympathy and the assurance of the Pennsylvania attorney general's office that a criminal and civil investigation has begun.
But it is unlikely they will ever recover their money.
"I thought I was a sophisticated person," says a New York City woman who bought Wild Acres property.
"How little I knew."

   This predicament came about when the state environmental authorities revoked a permit to build a sewage-treatment plant at Wild Acres.
That occurred on Sept. 4, 1981, as a result of a lawsuit filed in October 1979 by sportsmen who charged that the plant's effluent would kill pickerel, bass and perch in nearby Lake Maskenozha.
Septic tanks can be used elsewhere in Wild Acres, but the soil on the 250 affected lots isn't suitable for them.

   Most of the 250 lots were sold after the suit was filed -- in 1980 and 1981.
In fact, some were sold after the revocation, although revocation meant that home-building permits could no longer be issued for any of them.
Many purchasers say that salesmen for the developer, Marcon Inc., a subsidiary of All-American Realty Co. of Wayne, N.J., either didn't mention the looming problem or made light of it.

   Misfortunes like these have put this fast-developing section of northeast Pennsylvania on the map for more than scenic splendor.
Speaking of this region in general, not of Wild Acres in particular, an investigator for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development says: "Texas and Florida are the most active states for land-sales abuse, but the Poconos are right up there."

   Unhappiness seems out of place at Wild Acres.
With scenic lakes, woods, clean air and abundant wildlife, it offers facilities for tennis, boating, swimming and skiing.
"In the winter," says one year-round resident, "it looks like a picture post card."

   Nikki Mayer, a U.S. Customs inspector from New Jersey, hankered to own a piece of this paradise.
On Sept. 27, 1981, she and her husband paid Marcon $13,200 for a parcel of land.
"We were going to build an all-year house with wall-to-wall carpeting," she says.
The couple planned to move to Wild Acres permanently.

   Five years later, there is still no house.
Ms. Mayer says that when she bought her half-acre lot, Marcon didn't tell her that the sewage plant's permit had been canceled 23 days before.
Nobody knows when, if ever, the sewage plant will be allowed to operate or whether a different system will be installed.

   Meanwhile, some of the lot owners are paying off mortgages obtained at rates as high as 18% -- and are being dunned for maintenance and services on land they don't use.
Chances of recouping their investment from the developers are dim: Marcon and All-American Realty are bankrupt, and creditor banks have grabbed most of the debtors' assets.
"The little people get stepped on again," says a bitter Ms. Mayer.

   Hundreds of people who purchased property in the Poconos at other subdivisions operated by All-American Realty are in a similar pickle.
Because sewage facilities were inadequate, public officials banned construction at Arrowhead Lake in 1982 and at Marcel Lake Estates in 1985.
By one count, 1,800 people put $17 million into unbuildable property at Arrowhead Lake, Marcel Lake and Wild Acres.

   Michael D'Alessio bought Wild Acres for $47,500 in 1945, according to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, and lived there until his death in 1976.
He and his brothers John and Alexander were identified in a U.S. Senate subcommittee report in 1963 as members of the Carlo Gambino crime family in New York.
Deeds show that in 1965 Michael D'Alessio sold Wild Acres to his son, Michael Jr., for $400,000.

   Michael Jr., a prominent Poconos home builder who spells his last name "Dalessio," sold most of Wild Acres to Marcon Inc. in 1967 for $1.2 million.
As part of the transaction, he received 20% of Marcon's stock, according to Irwin Marks, formerly a vice president of Marcon and of All-American Realty.
Mr. Dalessio became a director and assistant secretary of Marcon, posts he vacated about 1977 when he sold his stake in Marcon.

   Marcon and All-American Realty filed for protection against creditors in federal bankruptcy court in Newark, N.J., in September 1982.
In February 1984, an official of the Department of Housing and Urban Development urged the bankruptcy judge to address the problem of sewage disposal at their developments -- "a subject," HUD said, "of blatant misrepresentation in the debtors' sales operations."
But nothing was done for property owners.

   The collapse of All-American Realty and Marcon resulted from high interest rates and declining revenue, Mr. Marks says.
Combined revenue peaked at $12 million a year in the late 1970s.
"We were the largest builder of one-family homes in the Poconos and one of the largest in land sales," he says.

   He denies that buyers were defrauded.
"We don't operate that way," he says.
"Those who bought {at Wild Acres after the permit was revoked} were told that the lots were not buildable till the sewage problem got resolved."

   This statement is disputed.
"The Marcon salesman never told us there was a problem," insists Donna B. Della Pietra of New York City.
"He showed us the property and told us a sewage-treatment plant was going in."
Mrs. Della Pietra and her husband bought a $12,000 home site from Marcon on Sept. 13, 1981, nine days after the plant's license was revoked.

   On the property report that Marcon sent Mrs. Della Pietra are marginal jottings that she says were made by a Marcon salesman.
One reads: "Sewage lines are guaranteed extended by or before June 30, 1982."
Says Mrs. Della Pietra: "We were a young couple, just married.
It was the biggest mistake we ever made in our lives."

   Another New York couple, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Moraco, say that they, too, weren't told about the permit revocation when they bought Wild Acres property for $14,500 in July 1982.
Marcon was so eager to close the deal, Mrs. Moraco recalls, that "the salesman came all the way to Brooklyn to pick up our check."

   Some buyers blame their bankers.
Salvatore Dinolfo of Elmont, N.Y., a teacher of handicapped children, says that Northeastern Bank of Pennsylvania, in Scranton, didn't tell him that his $14,500 lot was unbuildable when it financed his Nov. 22, 1981, purchase.
"I wanted rest and relaxation and got a stomachache instead," he says.

   Fumes a New York woman who got a Northeastern loan for her $13,000 lot: "I'm paying an obscene 17%.
How can the bank expect us to pay a mortgage on something unbuildable?
This is not even in the realm of normalcy."

   The bank "wasn't aware till sometime in 1982" of the permit's revocation, says Wayne Miller, a spokesman.
"We were under the impression that steps were taken on a local basis to correct the {sewage} situation," he says.

   Ms. Mayer, the Customs inspector, says she made a $430 deposit in February 1982 to All-American Homes, an affiliate of All-American Realty, for construction of a $49,500 home.
Richard Hansen, whom she dealt with at All-American Homes, never told her that the lot was unbuildable, she says.
"The next thing we know," she adds, "All-American went out of business, our deposit was lost and the home will never be built."
Mr. Hansen says he had been aware of a problem at Wild Acres, "but it looked like everything would be settled," he says.

   Ms. Mayer says she was later told by All-American Realty that Parkside Construction, another Poconos home builder, would honor her contract with All-American Homes.
V. James Rocco, formerly the vice president of All-American Homes, now is the president of Parkside Construction and its 50% owner.
Michael Dalessio Jr. is the vice president and owns the other 50%, according to Marshall Anders, a Stroudsburg, Pa., attorney representing Parkside.

   If All-American Homes didn't inform some buyers that their property was unbuildable when it took their deposits, how could that have happened?
Attorney Anders says that according to Mr. Rocco, "All-American Realty and Marcon had been advised by counsel and engineers that the ban on construction would be lifted in a short time.
That advice turned out to be wrong."
A Pennsylvania court rejected Marcon's appeal of the ban in 1983.

   Though they are under court order to do so, numerous property owners refuse to pay dues to the "Wild Acres Country Club," as stipulated in their sales contracts.
Dues have jumped to $425 yearly from $200 in the past two years.
There is a small clubhouse as well as a swimming pool, but dues mainly are for the upkeep of Wild Acres' roads and other amenities.

   One New York woman dunned for dues fired off this irate reply: "The unmitigated gall of requesting dues for property which we are in the process of paying the mortgage on, but cannot by court order build a house on, is surpassed only by the fraudulent methods used in selling us the property."

   The dues were recently cut in half, to $212.50, for those who had bought the unbuildable lots.

   Wild Acres and its club now are operated by a real-estate company controlled by Marcon's chief creditors, First Eastern Bank -- a unit of First Eastern Corp. of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. -- and Midlantic Banks Inc. of Edison, N.J. John Appleton, First Eastern's outside counsel, says that when the bank took over in 1984, it had to put up its own money to keep the club running.
First Eastern contends that Wild Acres property owners owe $1.1 million in club dues.

   "I want to know what they are doing with the dues they collect," says Nick Mastrocovi, a retired truck driver who lives in one of Wild Acres' 1,100 homes but refuses to pay dues.
Residents say services have steadily declined.
Grass grows through cracks in the tennis court.
The ski slope's towrope is missing.
Baseball bleachers have been removed.
Roads need repair.

   Some aggrieved owners say Parkside recently has offered to buy unbuildable lots from them, but for only a small percentage of the original purchase price.
Parkside's attorney, Mr. Anders, says, "If Parkside is buying in the unbuildable section, it's for speculation."

   Parkside is also buying lots in buildable sections -- from owners fed up with the turmoil -- and reselling them at a large markup.
One lot it acquired for $2,500 was resold to a Paterson, N.J., couple for $14,600, according to realty transfer records.
Attorney Anders denies that profits are excessive.
Parkside's marketing costs, he says, represent half its selling prices.

   Parkside's activities were heatedly discussed at a packed meeting of the Wild Acres Property and Homeowners Association last September.
Later, at 12:45 a.m., the phone rang in the home of Seymour Sattler, a director of the association.

   "I hear you're going to sell your house," said someone who identified himself as "Mr.
Brown."
Mr. Sattler, a retired engineer who hasn't any intention of selling, says that he found a Parkside sign on his front lawn that night.
Lenore McKenna, the association chairman, got a similar call and sign.
"It means one of two things," she says.
"Someone has a warped sense of humor.
Or it's a message to get out."

   Parkside neither made the calls nor left the signs, Mr. Anders says.

<LEADPARA>  THERE is something to be said for being of a single place, as Frank Rizzo was
of Philadelphia.;    He was born there, in a row house in the heart of South
Philadelphia; he worked there and was married there and brought up his
children there; and, in the end, of course, he died there, on the bathroom
floor of his campaign headquarters, in the middle of another uphill battle to
reclaim the mayor's office.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A CITY AND A MAN, MERE MONUMENTS TO EACH
OTHER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Dexter is a columnist for the Sacramento Bee.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the 12 or 13 years I spent in Frank Rizzo's town, I remember his taking
only one trip -- to Italy, where, sitting in a lawn chair with the pope, he
told His Holiness that the way to handle Italy's crime problem was to break
heads, and offered to send some of Philadelphia's finest over to show Rome
police how to do it.;    I guess there were political trips, and vacation
trips to the Poconos or the New Jersey shore, but that wasn't really going
away because the shore and the Poconos were part of what it meant to be a
Philadelphian, too. Part of being of the place.;    At any rate, Frank Rizzo
was always in town.;    By the time I met him, in 1975, he was already in his
first term as mayor, and his best days may have been behind him. He had been
the most famous policeman in the city, and then the most famous police chief
in the world.;    He would become the city's most famous, most loved and most
hated mayor, too, but it was the stories of Rizzo's physical courage during
his years as a cop that fed the legend through his whole career. Philadelphia,
after all, is a place where physical courage is currency in every
neighborhood.;    In a newspaper column published the day after Rizzo's death,
a writer for the Daily News named Jack McKinney remembered how, as a rookie
cop, Frank Rizzo was dragged into an alley by a gang of Italian hoods and
beaten half to death, and how, after a long recuperation, he tracked them all
down, one by one, and evened the score.;    The point of that story was not
that Rizzo got his revenge, but that most human beings would have been broken
by a beating like that. But no Philadelphian ever had to be reminded that
Frank Rizzo wasn't most people. He was everyman, but he was better.;
Anyway, it was one thing to work the streets and another thing to run the
police department, and still another thing to run the city itself. The blunt,
straightforward, pragmatic methods that work on the street or behind closed
doors at the police station do not always work as well in the public arena.;
 I think now of a hundred stories at once. Rizzo, elected a Democrat,
nevertheless supported Richard Nixon against George McGovern in the 1972
presidential election, explaining, "McGovern's a f------ nut.";    I remember
Rizzo after his own re-election in 1975, predicting that "the liberals would
be jumping off the Falls Bridge now," saying that he "would make Attila the
Hun look like a faggot.";    And later on, in the '80s, furiously telling a
television reporter, on camera, that he'd like to fight him because he was a
lush and a coward and a liar.;    And while most people in the row houses
understood how he could say these things, a lot of rest of the world didn't,
and Rizzo was branded a racist and a thug in many enlightened parts of his own
city.;    At the most fundamental level, however, neither of those things was
true. Rizzo could be a bully, but it was always, as I look back on it, in
reaction to some perceived threat. Frank Rizzo was loyal to his friends and
protective of them, and his friends, in one degree or another, included half
the city. Walk half a block with him in Center City, and two dozen people
would shake his hand. It was that way while he was mayor, and it was that way
afterward.;    The charges of racism were more offensive to him, I think,
because he could look into himself without seeing any of it there. He wouldn't
let the argument turn political. Frank Rizzo looked at riots or street crime
-- he didn't care who was doing it -- he was on the other side. He was always
a cop.;    But more than that, he was a Philadelphian. He lived 70 years in
the city, and watched it change, often for the worse. He was no visionary; he
wanted the city back the way he remembered it.;    And looking at the mess the
place is in today, a lot of people must want the same thing.;    But you can't
go backward; you can't even stand still. Rizzo tried to accommodate change,
but it wasn't his strength. His strength lay simply in the city itself; he was
Philadelphia's flesh and blood and heart, a product of the place in a way that
those of us who move around can never be.;    He embodied the city, and was,
in the end, so exceptional a man that the city embodied him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A traffic court official who took over a
courtroom and sat down in the judge's chair to protest the handling
of his 26 tickets was fired Thursday.
   The official, T. Milton Street, yelled at the judge handling his
case Wednesday, then sat in her chair for most of the afternoon in
protest.
   President Judge George Twardy, who suspended Street last week,
said he decided to fire Street when he saw pictures of Street in
Judge Lillian Podgorski's chair.
   ``That is not right,'' Twardy said. ``I'll tell you the truth,
I'm not going to stand for it.''
   Street, a former state senator, was an assistant budget director
for the court.
   Twardy also fired Street's son, T. Milton Street Jr., a court
officer who was suspended when he wouldn't pay for nine tickets.
The son accompanied his father during Wednesday's sit-in, which
ended when police asked them to leave as the office closed for the
day.
   Street was back in Traffic Court on Thursday, getting paperwork
for an appeal of his case.
   He said he also would challenge the firing. ``Even with my big
mouth, I have rights,'' Street said.
   Street has 26 outstanding tickets and owes $2,559 in fines.
Twardy also said Street had six outstanding tickets in other
counties, including one from the Poconos.
   ``Not only that, but over the last 11 years, he hasn't had a
license or insurance,'' Twardy said.
   Street, who is black, has maintained that requiring a deposit -
$100 in his case - for a Traffic Court hearing is unconstitutional
and unfair to poor people, notably blacks and Hispanics.
   ``Poor people think I'm a hero,'' he said.
   Street said that he and his son would start a consulting service
for people facing Traffic Court.
   ``I'd save them thousands of dollars,'' he said. ``I'd advise
them of their rights.''

   LONG POND, Pa. -- The speedsters roar past the grandstand,
leaving behind them the heavy smell of melted rubber and hot
oil. On the backstretch, the car in third place uses the
windbreak created by the two leaders to position itself to
surge into first and steal the checkered flag.
   It is just the sort of breathtaking finish to bring a roar
from the crowd. Except there is no crowd -- unless you
consider the masses at the exits of the Poconos International
Raceway after the day's other races. But, then, these drivers
are used to empty bleachers. They race Pintos.

<TEXT>
   That's right, the ant-like subcompact pulled off the
market a decade ago amid a hubbub over the car's propensity
to burst into flames when hit in the rear. For Ford Motor
Co., the Pinto was easily its worst failure since the Edsel.
But the car has won a small but die-hard group of fans:
racing enthusiasts with big dreams and little budgets.
   Fifty dollars gets a Pinto from a junkyard. You might have
to haul it home on the back of a flatbed truck, but if you
assemble enough of the junkers you can put together a
racecar. And, best of all, there is no shortage of rusty
heaps from which to choose; Ford built more than a million
before taking the car off the market. "Every junkyard has
100," David Bowers, one of the first to race Pintos, says
happily.
   Installing the required safety equipment and souping up
the engine requires a bit more of an investment, but you can
put a Pinto on the track for less than $5,000, its fans say.
In contrast, racing a Porsche or a Corvette can cost more
than $90,000. And the Pinto isn't exactly the turtle of the
track, either. Some of the top racers have hit speeds of over
120 miles per hour -- pretty respectable for a car designed
to putter around for pennies per mile.
   "This is the most bang for your buck," says Michael
Goldsmith, a 33-year-old television cameraman from Hampstead,
Md., who races a screaming yellow Pinto. Among this sparse
crowd -- there are only 18 Pinto racers -- Mr. Goldsmith is
considered a big spender: He put some $8,000 into his Pinto,
splurging on the paint job and a sophisticated braking
system.
   As Mr. Goldsmith and his fellow drivers see it, Pinto
racing is something that Ford should be proud of, and perhaps
even exploit. After all, the company typically views racing
of its other models as a great marketing opportunity. Ford,
like the other big auto makers, spends millions (it won't say
just how much) to sponsor various forms of the sport.
   "This is the opportunity for them to prove that the Pinto
wasn't as bad as it was made out to be," Mr. Goldsmith says.
"We could take this show on the road and say, `Here's a Pinto
10 years later, and it's still going strong.'"
   But durability wasn't exactly the issue. Introduced in
1970 and pulled from the market a decade later, the car was a
costly debacle -- and a public-relations nightmare -- for
Ford. Critics asserted that the car's gasoline tank was
poorly positioned and, as a result, tended to puncture in
rear-end collisions, causing the car to explode.
   In 1980, an Indiana county prosecutor put Ford on trial on
charges of reckless homicide; Ford was accused of
deliberately taking safety shortcuts in designing the car and
thus causing the death of three teen-agers in a fiery
accident. Ford was acquitted in that case, but it has spent
years fighting a deluge of product-liability lawsuits. The
company is still spending money on the car, mostly for legal
fees.
   So, rather understandably, the charm of the car's
resurrection is lost on the company. "Oh, God]" groans Paul
Preuss, Ford's chief motor-sports spokesman. "I can't believe
somebody is racing Pintos in this day and age."
   Ford has made it quite clear it doesn't want anything to
do with this odd pack. The Pinto racers informally approached
the company about sponsorship several years ago, but gave up
when they got a chilly reception. Other commercial backers
are similarly tough to find. Racing Pintos are just as
colorfully festooned as the other cars on the track -- but
not with sponsors' decals. Some drivers tout pet causes.
"Save the Whales," "Plant a Tree" one car blares.
   Of course, the racing Pinto doesn't much resemble the ones
consumers drove out of showrooms in the 1970s. These cars are
specially modified to meet racing authorities' safety
requirements. Rules require all cars to be equipped with
special steel-and-plastic gas tanks that are virtually
impossible to puncture. Racers also must install internal
fire extinguishers and a roll cage that encases the entire
driver's compartment.
   The Pinto was born again during a late-night drinking
session at David Bowers's home in Alexandria, Va., in 1980.
Mr. Bowers, who works as a budget analyst for the Department
of Defense, is a self-described weekend racing junkie. But,
back then, he was getting increasingly frustrated with the
sport's spiraling costs.
   "You couldn't race competitively for under $20,000," he
says. With a similarly distressed group of racers, he hatched
the idea of racing the Pinto. After a few years of lobbying,
the Sports Car Club of America, which oversees amateur motor
racing, officially recognized the Pinto group as a distinct
racing class.
   The Pinto isn't as odd a candidate for the track as most
would think. Beneath its sheet metal beats the heart of true
racing machine. It has the frame and suspension of a sports
car, the Mustang II. And its 2.3-liter German-made engine is
durable, which makes engine failures less common and holds
down the cost of racing. Enlarge the camshaft, grind down the
cylinder heads, add a high-performance carburetor and you
transform a once-tame econo-box into a speed demon -- of
sorts.
   But racing this car takes more than a good mechanic and
quick reflexes. A sturdy ego is also helpful. Pinto drivers
endure a lot of snubs and sneers. Last year, at Watkins Glen
International Speedway in upstate New York, some Porsche and
BMW drivers objected to racing against Pintos. They feared
the slower cars would clog up the track, endangering other
drivers.
   The Porsche and BMW men dropped their objections after a
hasty -- and, for the Pinto men, humbling -- meeting. The
Pinto drivers managed to convince their foes "they know how
to get out of the way," says Gus Rosenberg, one of the
Porsche drivers.
   "Racing Pintos builds character," says Paul Moorcones, a
tire-store owner from Silver Spring, Md., and a long-time
racer. Once, at a cocktail party, a woman asked him what kind
of car he races. Pintos, he said. That was the end of that
conversation.
   Donald Caldwell, a racing comrade of Mr. Moorcones, agrees
that it takes a special person to race a Pinto -- and he
isn't one of them. Mr. Caldwell's 1983 Toyota Supra would eat
Pinto dust in a race, but the racer nonetheless says he
wouldn't consider driving the faster car. "I just can't see
myself in a Pinto," he says. "I think they are ugly little
cars."
   Being regarded as the pariahs of the racetrack may explain
why the Pinto racers are so closely knit. They help work on
each other's cars, and share parts and tools. Don Coronel,
who won the race at the Poconos Racetrack, won on an engine
given him by a competitor; Mr. Coronel blew out his engine
last year during a qualifying race.
   The Pinto racing crowd is admittedly less pretentious and
more quirky. Bruce Shelton, a 59-year-old cop from
Winchester, Va., says he took up racing years ago while in
the Air Force. One of his early victories: the Spanish
national go-cart championship in 1965.
   Mr. Coronel also caught the racing bug early. A short,
portly electrical engineer, he had childhood dreams of racing
at Indianapolis, but had to settle for a cheaper substitute.
He has an excellent track record in his Pinto. Of the three
races this year, he came in first in every one, including the
one in the Poconos.
   His daredevil style may account for his winning streak.
Intimidation might also. On the tail of his white Pinto, Mr.
Coronel has painted two skulls and crossbones. Between them
is his car's name: "The Terminator."

   Eighty young people boarded buses Friday to
escape _ at least for the 10 days of their mountain retreat _ the
turfs of the gangs that bring violence and drugs to their urban
neighborhoods.
   ``The thing I want to get out of this is to better my life,''
15-year-old Michael Williams said as he waited to board one of the
three buses going to the Pocono Mountains in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   Nearly all the 15- to 20-year-olds taking part in the ``Youth at
Risk'' program have been suspended from school at some point, and
about 30 are serious gang members, said Clinton Terrell, director
of community outreach and enrollment for the program.
   On Thursday, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission issued a report
that said gang violence will soon make organized crime family
activities seem tame.
   The retreat at a camp near Bushwick will included hikes along
with individual and group counseling.
   Some of the young people said they hoped to learn to control
their tempers or do better in school.
   ``I want to keep from getting locked up,'' said 16-year-old
Ronald Bouie.
   David Fisher has run the ``Youth at Risk'' for Breakthrough
Foundation in San Francisco for eight years and said its programs
have been succesful in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and
other cities. This is the first time the program has been offered
in Philadelphia.
   ``We're going to demand everything you've got, and when you
think you're out of gas, we're going to demand more,'' Fisher
warned Friday morning.
   He asked the youths to refrain from venting their anger with
violence.
   ``You are in a room full of people with short fuses,'' he said.
``This is going to be 10 days of peace. ... It's called growing
up.''
   Fisher said the youths were required to turn in any drugs,
weapons, radios and snack food before they can participate.
   ``What I'm telling you is put down your arms. Put down your
anger. Put down your hatred,'' he said.
   The youths appeared upset by only two of the rules: no snacking
between meals and no music except when the staff provides radios.
   Bennie Swans Jr., executive director of Crisis Intervention
Network, said the program's goal was to relieve tension and despair
among Philadelphia's youths caused by high unemployment and an
increased high school dropout rate.
   Swans said the same type of hopelessness caused gang violence
resulting in a death a week during gang wars in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
   ``All the problems we had to deal with 20 years ago, we still
have to deal with,'' said Swans, himself a veteran of the city's
gang wars.
   Hazel Floyd said her 18-year-old son, Curtis, came to her with
the idea of participating in the retreat. ``He just felt like he
wants to get away and sit down and think about what he wants to do
in the future,'' she said.
   Terrell said about $300,000 was raised for the program, which
will have 100 volunteers at the site in the Poconos and hold
monthly meetings for a year after the retreat.
   Ben Johnson, 19, of Oakland, Calif., took the course in 1986
when he was a junior in high school and selling cocaine.
   ``Some guys wanted to get me. My money wasn't coming straight.
My parents wanted to throw me out of the house. I was flunking out.
My life wasn't working,'' Johnson told the group.
   After the course, Johnson said, he took a job and finished high
school.
   ``I got dreams now,'' added Johnson, who is spending a year
working with ``Youth at Risk.''

Back in the late '60s, Theresa Saldana's mom was furious when she joined a
Brooklyn gang called the Little Warriors. Now the actress portrays a mom who's
harassed when her son refuses to join a gang in "Angel Town," an independent
action flick (it stars kick boxer Olivier Gruner) set for Nov. 22 release.
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing like the gangs we have now," said Saldana, who was "12 or 13"
when she briefly became a Warrior. "Our gang was more for the purpose of
hanging out together than anything else. It was like a baby version of (the
movie) 'Turf.' But in truth, there are violent gangs in that same neighborhood
today. If some of the same kids had grown up later, who knows?"

Saldana's mom, feeling the other gang members were "too rowdy," shipped young
Theresa off "to a Catholic camp in the Poconos, where I was frankly much
happier."

   A wind-whipped forest fire burned more than
10,000 acres in the isolated mountains of central Pennsylvania on
Sunday before crews brought it under control near the banks of the
Susquehanna River.
   The fire started Saturday morning in the Sproul State Forest and
moved north in warm, dry weather, authorities said.
   The fire burned a swath roughly three miles wide and eight miles
long to within several hundred yards of the Susquehanna's west
branch, where it was brought under control Sunday afternoon, said
Susan Woods, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental
Resources.
   ``It's still burning, but it has been raining so that should
help,'' she said Sunday afternoon.
   The fire stalled about 10 miles west of Renovo.
   ``This is one of the worst single-fire losses we've had since
the 1930s,'' Woods said.
   About 200 firefighters were aided by helicopters dumping water
and flame retardant chemicals, and bulldozers digging 15-foot wide
trenches.
   The fire began near a natural gas pipeline on a forest road, but
Ms. Woods said there were no reports of explosions.
   ``That wasn't determined to be a cause. More than likely the
cause was careless use of fire,'' she said.
   ``A 10,000-acre loss for Pennsylvania is a lot,'' Ms. Woods
said. ``Officials I spoke to couldn't remember a fire as serious as
this.''
   By comparison, fires charred about 16,000 acres of forest in all
of 1986. About 40,000 acres were lost in 1962-63 during a drought,
she said.
   Warm temperatures, low humidity and high winds Saturday had
raised the possibility of accidental fires, she said.
   Four recreational camps in the state forest were destroyed, Ms.
Woods said. Firefighters evacuated campers from the 540,000-acre
state forest, and no injuries were reported. Two people thought to
be hiking through the area were found unharmed by searchers Sunday
morning, she said.
   The area, about 30 miles north of State College, is largely
uninhabited and the fire posed no threat to homes, she said.
   At least three smaller forest fires were reported over the
weekend near Lewisburg, in the Poconos and in Warren County, Ms.
Woods said.

SUMMER-LIKE HEAT TAKES EARLY BOW IN EAST, MIDWEST

<TEXT>
<P>
Winter-weary Easterners and Midwesterners shucked their parkas and strolled
outdoors in shirt sleeves Monday as summer-like heat defrosted the Snow Belt
and broke or tied records in more than 50 cities.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures soared into the upper 80s and low 90s along the Atlantic Coast. In
Washington, D.C., the thermometer surged to 89 degrees, surpassing the old
record for the day by 14 degrees. Nearby Baltimore sweltered at an incredible
92. Richmond, Va., and Augusta, Ga., reached 88.
</P>
<P>
The high of 67 at La Crosse, Wis., broke a record set in 1877. Most of the
records were in the 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
The record-setting heat stretched from Sioux City, Iowa, east to Atlantic City
and from Minneapolis south to Greenville and Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
The premature summer weather is expected to entice the famous cherry trees
along the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., into full bloom by Thursday, five
days ahead of the previous record, National Park Service scientist William
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
That is bad news for organizers of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival,
scheduled for early April.
</P>
<P>
Ray Brady of the National Weather Service in Washington said that the record
heat was caused by a very warm southwesterly flow of air around a surface
high-pressure system centered to the southeast of the region.
</P>
<P>
He called the unseasonal weather a "little scary" and said it was expected to
remain unbroken at least through today.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was convinced, however, that the heat wave meant winter was gone
for good.
</P>
<P>
"This is the Poconos, and we could see snow on Easter Sunday," said Joe Pipolo,
owner of an auto detailing business in the mountains of northeastern
Pennsylvania. "March and April could be freaky months still."
</P>
<P>
In ordinarily wintry Illinois, the unusual weather resulted in more than 2
inches of weekend rains that were still causing havoc as the workweek began.
</P>
<P>
A flash-flood watch was canceled just before dawn, but more than 200 people
remained evacuated from their east-central Illinois homes because of flooding
along the Vermillion River that floated mobile homes off their moorings.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, but Interstate Water Co. in Danville was unable to
pump water from the river. The private utility asked customers to conserve
water and boil whatever they used. A shelter at a nearby grade school was
housing those flooded out in the villages of Alvin and Bismarck.
</P>
<P>
Scattered thunderstorms were expected through today in Oklahoma, where up to 5
inches of weekend rain forced more than 30 people from their homes in Skiatook
and routed about 20 people in Bartlesville and 15 in Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
Rain continued in North Texas, where torrential thunderstorms Sunday led to at
least one death. Paul Cooley, 13, drowned Sunday night after falling into a
rain-swollen creek in Trophy Club.

   A wedding you plan yourself is unique, but that quality of
originality is what makes it typical, says Barbara Tober, editor of
Bride's Magazine.
   So the wedding of Justin Edwards and Annie Chervin was unique to
them, of course, but typical.
   ``The desire to make a wedding personal in all its aspects is
paramount today. All the elements - from ethnic customs to what
they wear and what they eat and how they travel to the ceremony -
are being considered and personal choices are being made,'' says
Tober.
   ``No less important is having the people they regard as family
present at the wedding. Today, a couple wants to make a connection
with family in whatever way they can. Not everyone has a big
family. Or they may have given up on their relatives but want to
include those who are meaningful.''
   Today's weddings are traditional in that people send
invitations, make vows, have a meal, cut a cake, have toasts and go
on a honeymoon. What is different now is that there are so many
choices in every one of these activities. Many couples have an
essentially traditional service, but they may add to or modify it,
observes Tober.
   ``The wedding dress can have a handkerchief hem, be ballet
length or have a cathedral train and four types of beads. Or be a
simple dress or a lace suit. There's every neckline, every kind of
fabric.''
   Flowers? ``From grape hyacinths and miniature tussy mussies to
roses and gardenias.''
   Cakes can be the traditional tiered white cake or have a
different flavor in every layer. Some people choose custom-made
replicas of themselves. The honeymoon can be a long weekend in the
Poconos or a trip to India or Africa, says Tober.
   Or it can be an adventure in the waters off the coast of Turkey
on a small sailboat with your new in-laws, as was Annie and
Justin's delayed summer honeymoon trip.

   PITTSBURGH -- Mellon Bank Corp., seeking to expand into
northeastern Pennsylvania, agreed to buy a unit of Midlantic
Corp. for $90.2 million.
   The acquisition of United Penn Bank, based in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., would give Mellon a No. 3 market share in
a region of the state where it currently has no presence. It
also continues Mellon's efforts to build up its profitable
consumer banking operations while reducing its wholesale and
real estate lending business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Midlantic, which has been hard hit by losses from real
estate loans, the move is part of the bank holding company's
strategy to shed assets and build capital.
   Mellon, buoyed by the rise in its stock price this year,
has said it's looking to make either in-market acquisitions
or acquisitions in contiguous markets. Several months ago,
the bank holding company raised $152 million in a stock
offering for such purchases. Last month Mellon disclosed that
it was discussing buying Perpetual Financial Corp., a failed
thrift based in Vienna, Va., in a government-assisted
transaction.
   In United Penn, Mellon is adding $1.4 billion in assets
and a strong retail branch network. United Penn has $1.3
billion in deposits and 34 branch offices in six counties in
northeastern Pennsylvania. For the first six months of the
year, United Penn's net income was $2 million, and its
nonperforming assets totaled $28 million, or 2.6% of loans
and related assets. Mellon had $28.7 billion in assets as of
June 30.
   While United Penn's results have been modest, it has stuck
to consumer banking and has avoided the real estate losses in
the Poconos that have ensnared other banks in the region.
   Mellon said that Glenn Y. Forney, United Penn's chief
executive officer and president, will become chief executive
and president of Mellon Bank-Northeast Region. Mellon said it
expects to save costs by consolidating data processing
facilities and through layoffs, although the number of
layoffs is undetermined. The sale is expected to be completed
by December.
   In addition to United Penn, Midlantic, based in Edison,
N.J., has an agreement to sell York Bank &amp; Trust Co. of York,
Pa., to First Maryland Bancorp, a U.S. unit of Allied Irish
Banks PLC, and has also slated for sale additional assets.
Midlantic hopes to shrink its assets by $6.2 billion, or 29%
of total assets of $21.54 billion as of June 30.
   Mellon was quoted at $34.875, up 87.5 cents, in late New
York Stock Exchange trading. Midlantic rose 37.5 cents to $8
in national over-the-counter trading.

Mothers, please, give your children a gift this Mother's Day. Give the facts of
your life -- at least some of them, so that your children and theirs will not
lose you.
</P>
<P>
I have lost my mother in the sense that she is unable to convey to me the facts
of her life. She has suffered almost total memory loss; she will be 88 this
summer. The only evidence of her vitality as a young woman is in photographs,
undated, of her ice-skating and canoeing, of her on a ship and on a boardwalk.
Judging by the clothes, the photos are from the 1920s and 1930s. But there
aren't any notations about the places and the people in the photographs. The
photos are scraps; there isn't any scrapbook. I wish I knew what she thought
about and hoped for back then.
</P>
<P>
A Certificate of Honorable Service from the Army Air Forces 1 Fighter Command
Aircraft Warning Service says she was "a loyal and faithful volunteer." It is
dated May, 1944, Mitchell Field, New York. I try to picture her in an airfield
bunker wearing earphones and moving miniature planes across a map as position
reports are relayed to her. I try to imagine what it was like. She never talked
about this service.
</P>
<P>
The framed photos of my parents have no context. I don't know how they met or
when they decided to marry. From their marriage certificate (Harrisburg, Pa.,
Aug. 26, 1945) and my father's discharge papers (Indiantown Gap Military
Reservation, Aug. 24, 1945), I can make a few assumptions. There is no other
physical evidence at hand. Family and friends are gone.
</P>
<P>
My father died unexpectedly three years ago. The few times I broached the
subject of his past, he asked why I wanted to know. I never had a good answer.
He wasn't given to talking about such things, and my mother, I suspect, took
her cues from him. And I was shy about probing into my parents' personal lives.
I didn't imagine they had anything to hide, nothing scandalous or shocking or
shameful. I was curious but reluctant to pursue matters they had no inclination
to divulge. By the time I had the courage and clarity to ask my mother about
her life, her responses were not reliable; they were interesting, and maybe
revealing, but not reliable.
</P>
<P>
Did she actually work in her father's tobacco shop in 1915, at the age of 13?
Did he leave her alone in the shop when he had to make a delivery? Was she
scared? Did she have to work, and give up school, so her sisters could go on to
higher education? Did she drive her brother's Pierce-Arrow to a lodge in the
Poconos for a weekend? And did the young people gathered there come out to the
front lawn to admire "her" car? What happened to my father's Army uniforms? Did
she and my father go to Atlantic City for their honeymoon? During labor, in
Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, was she really seen by a doctor who had
attended F.D.R.?
</P>
<P>
I think she went to great lengths for me. Did we walk all the way around the
field behind our first apartment to get to the convent for music lessons? I
remember (barely) holding a triangle. How many buses did she and I have to take
to get me to Cub Scout meetings?
</P>
<P>
I remember neatly folded T-shirts and towels being packed for overnight camp.
Or was it for ROTC boot camp? What did she think about when she sewed on my
name tags? And when she saw me off? Did she wash and iron for every game? Our
house was always neat and clean. I wonder what she thought about as she did the
cooking and cleaning, day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
I have some sense of what she feared for me. I know she worried that my little
forays into student politics might lead to the rough-and-tumble of real
political endeavors. I don't know what she imagined for my future. I know she
worried about my heart being broken. When things didn't go my way at school, in
sports or at work, she'd console me by saying, "You'll be lucky in love." When
I wasn't lucky in love, she said that I had a lot to be grateful for. I wonder
if that was how she viewed her lot in life.
</P>
<P>
There are so many things about her I would like to know; so many things about
our family I would like to know; so many things about me as a baby and a little
boy I wish she could tell me. It was always too soon to ask. Now it is too
late.

<HL> Caesars World Says
Per-Share Profit Rose
70% in Its 1st Quarter</HL>

<TEXT>
   Caesars World Inc. expects to report per-share earnings rose more than 70% in the fiscal 1988 first quarter.

   The hotel and casino concern said per-share earnings were 85 cents to 92 cents, based on about 33 million common shares outstanding.
In the first quarter ended Oct. 31, 1986, earnings were 50 cents a share, or $15 million, on 30 million shares outstanding.
Revenue was $198 million.

   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record quarterly earnings to strong performances at all of the company's properties.
The company's flagship Caesars Palace in Las Vegas did particularly well, he said, while its casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., Lake Tahoe, Nev., and four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos reported improved results "across the board."

   Costs stemming from an unsolicited takeover bid by the New York investor Martin Sosnoff in fiscal 1987 have mostly been accounted for, Mr. Gluck said in an interview.
Those costs included an unusual pretax charge of $27.7 million for the year ended July 31 and after-tax charges of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter from the redemption and payment of debt.

   In the latest quarter, Caesars World bought 11 million, or about 31%, of its shares at $29.50 a share in a tender offer prompted by the Sosnoff bid.
Although earnings for the quarter will reflect changes in the corporate tax rate, results won't include other major extraordinary or unusual items related to the takeover bid or the buyback, Mr. Gluck said.

   Mr. Gluck said it didn't appear that the recent stock market crash would have any immediate impact on the company's businesses.
He noted that Caesars's Atlantic City property continued to lead the city's casinos in gambling winnings in October, which he attributed in part to the company's strategy of a balanced customer mix in all its casinos.

   Caesars's retail merchandising activities are expected to double this year, he said.
Introduction of the company's new fragrances, Caesars Man and Caesars Woman, is scheduled for December.

   Showers were scattered across parts of the Northeast on
Saturday, while rain fell in parts of the South and California.
   Snow showers extended from southern New York state and northern
New Jersey across Pennsylvania, northeastern West Virginia,
northeastern Ohio and eastern Lower Michigan.
   Two inches of snow had fallen since Friday at the
Allentown-Bethleham-Easton Airport in eastern Pennsylvania, and
there were reports of up to 4 inches of snow in the Poconos of
northeastern Pennsylvania, the National Weather Service said.
Syracuse, N.Y., got 2 inches in the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST.
   Snow mixed with rain fell across Delaware.
   Rain fell in west-central and northern California and
north-central Arizona.
   Rain amounts in northern California were light, but the weather
service said that had it not rained through Monday, the San
Francisco Bay area would have tied a no-rain February record that
was set in 1864.
   ``It's so dry now that even when we get rain it will take a few
days to get soaked in so we can get some runoff,'' said Gayle
Montgomery, spokesman for the East Bay Municipal Utility District.
He said water rationing was not out of the question if the dry
conditions continue.
   Rain also fell in central Mississippi and eastern Virginia.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 25
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 79 at both Kingsville and McAllen,
Texas. The early-morning low for the day was 14 degrees below zero
at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered snow was forecast across Upper Michigan.
Showers were forecast in northern and central California, into the
Tahoe Basin of western Nevada.
   High in the 20s were predicted in Upper Michigan and northern
through west-central New England; in the 30s and 40s from the
remainder of New England and the Great Lakes across the Ohio
Valley, the Atlantic states through Virginia, the upper Mississippi
Valley, much of the Dakotas, and northeastern Montana; in the 70s
to low 80s in southern Florida, much of Louisiana, from southern
Kansas across much of Texas, and in southern California and the
desert Southwest; and in the 50s and 60s in most of the rest of the
nation.

   Every day since an earthquake ravaged
this mountain resort July 16, photographer Washington Canilao goes
to Burnham Park hoping someone will ask him for souvernir pictures.
Few do.
   ``Business is slow,'' said Canilao, 39, a park photographer
since 1966. ``The only people asking us for photographs are people
who want pictures of their damaged homes. We are hoping some
tourists would start promenading the park again.''
   But officials fear it may take years for the city's tourism
industry to recover.
   The devastating earthquake killed nearly 400 people in this
city, where thousands of Filipinos spend their summers to escape
the country's torrid tropical heat.
   Nationwide, more than 1,600 people died and about 1,000 others
are missing. More than 90,000 people are homeless.
   For Baguio's 300,000 residents, the return to normalcy has been
slow.
   There have been scattered incidents of looting and muggings of
pedestrians at night along Baguio's Session Road, the main
thoroughfare.
   Grocery and department stores are open only for a few hours a
day. The main market is closed but vendors are scattered along many
sidestreets.
   Thousands have left the city to live with relatives in the
lowlands until aftershocks cease and conditions improve.
   Many residents also have remained outdoors, staying in tents or
their cars for fear of the potential danger of aftershocks.
   Baguio, nearly a mile above sea level, is a city designed for
fun and relaxation. After seizing the islands in 1898, the
Americans searched for a mountain refuge from the sweltering
tropical heat.
   They chose a site 130 miles north of Manila where the cool
nights and sweet pine air reminded then of America's Catskills and
Poconos.
   Daniel Hudson Burnham, who pioneered development of the
skyscraper in Chicago and New York, designed the city, whose major
park bears his name.
   The American presence remains. U.S. officials estimate about
1,500 American civilians live in Baguio. The city includes the U.S.
Air Force's Camp John Hay, a rest and recreation area for the
40,000 American service members, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents stationed in the Philippines.
   But the quake heavily damaged eight hotels, including the luxury
Hyatt Terraces.
   ``The job of restoring Baguio is difficult,'' said city engineer
Valentin Julian. ``It will take 10 to 15 years to rebuild Baguio
and that depends on the availability of funds.''
   Julian said about half the buildings and homes in the city
reported major damage and another 40 percent suffered cracks and
minor damage. About 15 percent of the buildings reporting major
damage will have to be condemned.
   Johnvic Trinos, a Baguio resident, said the main problem facing
the city is the lack of electricity.
   ``Restore electricity and business will follow suit,'' Trinos
said. Power has been restored in areas near the city hall,
hospitals and water stations but the rest of the city remained
without electricity.
   Mayor Jaime Bugnosen said he is optimistic that the city will
recover in a few years.
   ``I would not accept (Baguio) is dead or dying,'' Bugnosen said.
``We are all still alive here.''

   Caesars World to Manage Nevada Hotel
   As Part of Japanese Development Plan

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Caesars World Inc. said it signed an
agreement with Cosmo World, a Japanese development concern,
to manage a non-casino luxury hotel as part of a $600 million
master planned community near Henderson, Nev.
   The 1,228-acre Cosmo World project, situated roughly 15
miles from Las Vegas, will include 2,500 homes, a
championship golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, a tennis
complex and other facilities. The project, called Silver
Canyon, is scheduled to open in 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 350-room hotel, Caesars Canyon Resort, would be
Caesars' first non-casino luxury resort. Caesars also
operates honeymoon properties in the Poconos, which are aimed
at a middle-class market.
   Caesars World didn't break out the details of its
management contract with the developers, but Henry Gluck,
Caesars chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company may consider other joint projects with Cosmo World in
the future. He also said the company's newly created Caesars
World Resorts subsidiary will seek similar projects, mostly
through management agreements.
   Cosmo World executives couldn't be reached to comment.
Cosmo World builds and operates golf courses in Japan, where
it currently has six courses under construction. The company
recently opened a golf course in Salzburg, Austria, and is
planning other projects in the United States and Europe. The
company also makes golf clubs and professional photography
equipment.
   Silver Canyon, as well as other planned projects, is part
of a new wave of development here that regional officials say
will help position the area as a destination resort rather
than just a gambling mecca. The Cosmo resort also is designed
to attract international visitors who travel with families or
who dislike staying in a casino-hotel.
   Mr. Gluck said the hotel venture is part of the company's
efforts to cash in on the Caesars name, which is particularly
well known in the international market. "We have a tremendous
consumer franchise," Mr. Gluck said.
   Some Wall Street analysts, however, have voiced skepticism
about Caesars' other marketing ventures, such as its
fragrance line. Also, they note, major new competitors in
Caesars' key casino markets are targeting the company's
high-rolling clientele. Mr. Gluck said the resort will be a
good marketing tool for its casinos, and doesn't demand the
hundreds of millions in capital that Caesars would need to
launch a similar project by itself.
   Despite the added competition to its casinos, Mr. Gluck
said Caesars' basic business remains strong. The retail
shopping project at its flagship Caesars Palace, which is
scheduled to open in late 1991, is already 65% leased, he
said.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury indicted a reputed
high-ranking officer in an Asian drug organization Monday for
allegedly conspiring to export $1 billion worth of heroin from
Thailand to the United States.
   U.S. Attorney James West said the alleged operation was sort of
a ``Golden Triangle Factory Outlet'' for heroin. The Golden
Triangle is a remote drug-producing region of Southeast Asia.
   The case relied in part on the U.S. Justice Department's first
approval of roving wiretaps, in which 30 pay telephones were tapped
in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains resort region, West said.
   West said suspects in the drug ring used pay telephones to elude
detection. When surveillance showed the suspects were making a call
from one of the 30 phones, the wiretap was activated and calls to
seven or eight foreign countries monitored, he said.
   He said the alleged deal to bring as much as 2,000 kilograms _
4,400 pounds _ of heroin into this country a year through Mexico
represents the largest heroin trafficking scheme known to the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency.
   Named in the indictment was Na Ts'ai K'uei, pronounced
Na-Say-Cue, a native of Yunan, China, who had been living in Chiang
Ra province in Thailand. Na, already serving a jail term in
Thailand, is considered one of the most skilled heroin chemists and
refinery operators in the Golden Triangle, West said.
   ``What impresses me after 19 years in law enforcement is that
this indictment comes in at the highest levels,'' West said.
   West said the charges stem from a two-year-old investigation of
a heroin-trafficking organization based in the Poconos. The leader
of that organization, Raphael Santana, pleaded guilty in October to
conspiring to import heroin from Thailand and is awaiting
sentencing.
   The investigation is continuing, West said.
   The prosecutor claimed Na is one of the highest-ranking officers
in the Shan United Army, a rebel force of more than 4,000 heavily
armed soldiers that operates primarily in Burma.
   West said the Shan leader, known as Khun Sa, is considered the
world's largest supplier of heroin. Khun Sa and the SUA have
controlled opium and heroin production in the Gold Triangle along
the Thai-Burma border since the 1960s, West said.
   West said Khun Sa's organization is responsible for all phases
of heroin production, including opium poppy crops and laboratories
to refine heroin and morphine.
   Under terms of the deal, West said, an initial shipment of 100
kilograms of heroin, several thousand kilograms of marijuana and
various weapons, including M-16 assault rifles and rocket and
grenade launchers, were shipped to Mexico.
   According to the indictment, the drugs were to be smuggled into
the United States and the weapons funneled to Colombian drug lords.
Thai police, alerted by U.S. investigators, intercepted some of the
drugs, but not the weapons, West said.
   West alleged the deal was arranged by Albert Castagnola Jr. of
Summit Hill, Pa., who went to Bangkok to arrange for annual
shipments of 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms of heroin. Castagnola also
has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.
   Na began serving a six-year jail term in Thailand in May for
possession of 500 grams of opium, West said. Although the U.S. and
Thailand do not have an extradition treaty, West said every effort
would be made to bring Na to this country.

<TEXT>
   The defense attorney in a bizarre case of
manacled women, murder and dismemberment says he wants a jury from
rural Pennsylvania to hear the case because of the widespread
publicity surrounding it.
   Gary Heidnik is charged with keeping four women chained to a
sewer pipe in a basement torture chamber and killing two others.
   ``I want a jury from a less urban county. Somebody in the
Poconos would know less (about the case) than somebody in
Pittsburgh,'' said A. Charles Peruto Jr., Heidnik's attorney.
   Peruto's first motion after the assignment of Judge Lynn Abraham
to the case this morning was for the out-of-town jury.
   ``I don't think there is a Philadelphian around who doesn't know
the case and want him'' sentenced to death, the attorney said.
   That motion and others are expected to take up the rest of the
week, Peruto said as he and the prosecuting attorneys headed for
Abraham's chambers for the first conference on pending requests.
   Heidnik was arrested shortly after a woman, who said she had
been held in his basement, led police to his north Philadelphia
house. Three half-naked, starved women were found chained there in
the pre-dawn hours of March 25, 1987.
   The limbs of another were found packaged in the kitchen freezer
and the body of a second woman, whom police say Heidnik killed, was
found in a southern New Jersey forest later that day.
   The woman who led police to the house testified at Heidnik's
preliminary hearing that one victim died while hanging by an arm
from the basement ceiling. Police say Heidnik then dismembered her
body in a bathtub.
   The other victim died when Heidnik touched her manacles with
electrical wires while she stood in water, the woman testified.
   Peruto said he will argue his client was insane.
   ``Schizophrenia in its simplest form represents dual
personality. ... It's a classic case of Jekyll and Heidnik,'' he
said.
   Peruto said he has documents that will prove Heidnik was the
subject of LSD tests by the U.S. Army in the early 1960s. The
tests, he said, aggravated his client's schizophrenia.
   The Pentagon has acknowledged performing chemical research with
LSD on 741 volunteers from 1955 to 1967. In a 1981 report, the
Pentagon said most soldiers suffered no significant damage as a
result.
   Peruto declined to say whether Heidnik would take the stand.

   Law enforcers say John J. Gotti's indictment
could mean a promotion for his son John, whom they describe as a
quick-fisted, barrel-chested Mafia prince with more brawn than
brains.
   Because most of the top men in the Gambino crime family are
under indictment, behind bars, or both, Gotti ``could very well try
to run the family through his son,'' Jules Bonalovonta, the FBI's
organized crime expert in New York, said in an interview last
month.
   ``Well, nothing could please us more,'' he said. ``You're not
talking about a brain surgeon.''
   Bonalovonta said Gotti recently elevated his 26-year-old son -
known universally as ``Junior'' - to the rank of capo, or captain.
The father was indicted Wednesday on charges that he ordered the
murder of his predecessor, and could be held without bail until his
trial.
   Born Feb. 14, 1964, John A. Gotti was the first child of John J.
and Victoria Gotti. After graduating from a military high school
outside New York City in 1982, he apparently went right into the
family business.
   In 1985, the younger Gotti allegedly slugged an off-duty
policeman who was telephoning for help to break up a fight at a
Queens diner, authorities said.
   In 1986, his driver's license was suspended after he ignored
numerous traffic summonses, authorities said.
   In 1989, he was arrested for beating up three people outside a
Long Island nightclub - one of several such brawls in which he has
been embroiled, usually because one of his friends insulted or
accosted a woman, authorities said.
   But Gotti seemingly inherited his father's talent for dodging
prosecutorial bullets. He was found innocent of the diner assault
after a man he allegedly threatened with a knife claimed to have
kept his eyes closed throughout the fight.
   In the nightclub case, a grand jury refused to indict Gotti
after witnesses said they could not identify any of the assailants.
   The younger Gotti describes himself as president of a Brooklyn
trucking company, but investigators say he has his own crime
``crew'' involved in construction extortion, auto theft,
loansharking and narcotics.
   ``Junior is treated with respect by the other (Mafia) crew
leaders,'' an unidentified law enforcement source told the Daily
News a year ago. ``They kiss him on the cheek like he's somebody
special.''
   But Junior takes orders, too. In a conversation recorded by
investigators, John Gotti complained to his son that one of the
son's friends had dropped Gotti's name in a telephone conversation
about a criminal scheme.
   Gotti told his son the friend should desist or enter the
hospital. ``Before you do anything,'' he said, ``you tell me first.
... Now make sure you see me tomorrow and I'll tell you what I want
you to do there.''
   ``All right,'' the son replied.
   The elder Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, describes Junior as an
honors student, devoted son and ``health nut'' who has no social
life because he works 14 hours a day as ``a totally legitimate
businessman.''
   As for drugs, Cutler says young Gotti ``won't even take an
aspirin.''
   Although he dresses as flamboyantly as his father, the
5-foot-9-inch Gotti is best known for his muscular physique, the
product of many hours in the weight rooms of various Long Island
health clubs.
   Earlier this year he married Kim Albanese, the daughter of a
carpet installer with no apparent mob ties. His father stayed away
from the ceremony in a successful attempt to make sure journalists
did the same.
   Two months later the new Mrs. Gotti gave birth to a son, John A.
Jr., John J. Gotti's first grandson. The family lives in a split
level house in an expensive waterfront section of the Long Island
suburb of Massapequa.
   Whatever his shortcomings, young Gotti apparently has some sense
of duty. He helps out at his father's annual Fourth of July party
for neighbors of the Gotti crew's Queens clubhouse. ``We don't do
this for ourselves,'' he told a reporter last year. ``I got a house
in the Poconos I'd rather be at.''

Per-Share Rise of 60%
In Profit for Quarter</HL>

   Caesars World Inc. expects to report that per-share earnings increased about 60% in the second quarter ended Jan. 31, Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, said.

   Mr. Gluck said the per-share figure would be "in the range of 40 cents."
In the year-earlier quarter, the hotel and casino concern had earnings of $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $163.8 million.

   The chairman said the company's program to establish a "balanced customer mix" of middle-income and lower-income players in addition to high rollers is "starting to work."

   Mr. Gluck said the company expects to report improved results at Caesars Palace, the company's flagship hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
He cited increased traffic in the casino since the opening of the World of Caesars, a simulated Roman temple with audio/visual and fiber-optic displays.

   He said the company expects "the first profitable second quarter" in the history of Caesars's hotel-casino at Lake Tahoe, Calif. and improvement in earnings at its Atlantic City, N.J., hotel-casino.
Mr. Gluck said Caesars's four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos "continue to be performing well."

   Analysts have forecast fiscal 1987 earnings of $1.55 a share.
Mr. Gluck declined to comment specifically on the predictions except to say, "if we're in the 40-cent range (for the second quarter), we're ahead of what the expectations are."
For the first quarter ended Oct. 31, the company reported earnings of $15 million, or 50 cents a share, on revenue of $198 million.

   For the year ended July 31, 1986, Caesars earned $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million.

   Mr. Gluck said the company is "reevaluating on a monthly basis" whether to sell or build on the company's seven acres of undeveloped land along the Atlantic City boardwalk.

   Mr. Gluck said the impending opening of two new casinos in Atlantic City "won't have a dramatic impact on the high end of the business," Caesars's bread-and-butter clientele.
"I see this as increasing the size of the market for us to participate in," he said.

   Caesars shares closed Friday at $23.125, up $1.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Summer camp directors planned letters to parents
and pharmacies yanked cans from shelves Friday after two top insect
repellents were recalled because a long-used ingredient made lab
rats sick.
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that the
makers of Deep Woods OFF! and Cutter's insect repellents had
voluntarily recalled their products because of the findings.
   The ingredient's manufacturer, McLaughlin Gormley King Co. of
Minneapolis, told the government that preliminary testing showed an
additive known as R-11 gave tumors to lab rats and withered their
ovaries. The company asked that its license to make the product be
withdrawn.
   About 200 brands of repellent use R-11, which helps repel flies
that bite.
   ``I will just make sure that when my final notice goes out to
parents, if they don't know about it not to send anything with
their child that's on the recall list,'' said Betsy Cobb, owner of
Camp Runoia, a small girls camp in Belgrade Lakes, Maine.
   Cobb said the camp does not recommend a brand of insect
repellent children should bring, but said she would check to see
what children were using.
   ``I would not put it on a child,'' said Dolly Jacobson, owner of
Buck and Beaver Camp in Shohola, Pa., in the Poconos mountains,
which attracts about 100 boys and girls ages 7 to 15.
   ``I'm planning on covering it during orientation _ telling them
to be on the lookout in case parents haven't heard about it,'' she
said.
   Two of the major users of the additive are S.C. Johnson and Son
Co. of Racine, Wis., which makes OFF! products, and Miles Co. of
Elkhart, Ind., producer of Cutter's.
   OFF! spokeswoman Barbara Jorgensen said 150,000 cases of Deep
Woods OFF! containing R-11 were in circulation. The company on
April 6 asked retailers to return the product and exchange it for a
newly formulated one.
   Deep Woods OFF! has contained R-11 since it was first
manufactured in 1973. The new version will will bear a red sticker
on the cap saying ``New Forumla,'' she said. Other OFF! products
are not affected by the recall.
   ``There's a huge concern that there would be product
confusion,'' said Jorgensen. ``We don't want people to overreact to
this and not use insect repellents this season ...''
   Miles Inc. on April 10 asked its retailers to return Cutter's
aeresol, pump spray and lotion, which contained R-11. The new
versions without the chemical will have a yellow sticker.
   ``Our concern is that consumers not become overly alarmed
because this does not pose a health risk,'' company spokeswoman
Dionn Tron said.
   Rite Aid Corp., one of the nation's leading drug-store chains,
notified its 2,350 stores in 22 states to pull the problem
repellents from shelves. A Rite Aid official said the company was
waiting to retrieve all the old formula before stocking the new
versions.
   ``We do have the new formula in warehouses but we want to make
sure we only get the product that manufacturers have approved as
safe on the shelves,'' said the official, who asked not to be named.
   Bonnie Carmody, manager of Naults Heights Pharmacy in Concord,
N.H., said she pulled the remaining 12 cans of the products off the
shelves Friday after a pharmacist heard a news report about the
recall.
   She said Deep Woods OFF! and Cutter's products were big sellers
in New England _ dreaded for its summer bug migration _ and she
expected consumers to buy the replacement versions.
   About 25 percent of all insect repellents on the market use the
additive, formally known as
2,3,4,5-Bis(2,butylene)tetrahydro-2-furaldehyde. The technical name
appears on product labels.
   The government said it has done no independent testing of R-11,
requiring pesticide manufacturers to conduct safety tests, and does
not know how dangerous it may be. The ingredient has been used for
35 years.

   The Patriarch of Polka,
   On Tour for 61 Years Now

   MONROEVILLE, Pa. -- Busloads of swooning fans mob a
theater to hear their idol, tan and blue-eyed, play the music
they've come to love:
   "I don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for
me," sings a smiling Frankie Yankovic. He pumps his accordion
and charms them into joining along, "Oh, she's too fat for
me."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "He's the king," sighs 66-year-old Dorothy Rigatti, who
has just bought two compact disks and three tapes from
Frankie's wife, Ida, during intermission at a show here. Mrs.
Rigatti and 39 other admirers from the South Park Senior
Citizens have been Yankovic groupies since the 1940s when
American Legion, Polish Falcons and Slovenian social halls
throughout the Midwest were hopping to polkas by Frankie
Yankovic and the Yanks.
   And the beat goes on. Mr. Yankovic, who just turned 76,
still does 150 to 200 polka shows a year, putting thousands
of miles on a van that is equipped with a queen-size bed. His
latest loop, which included a one-nighter for the Eistentein
Bushwachers Snowmobile Club in Park Falls, Wis., went like
this: Ohio to Wisconsin to Michigan, back to Wisconsin, then
to Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Ohio and then Pennsylvania.
That was August.
   Mr. Yankovic has been on the road for 61 years. He's on
his third marriage -- his first two wives couldn't stand him
being away 11 months a year. Now his third wife, Ida, travels
with him. He broke his back in a 1963 car accident and had
triple bypass surgery seven years ago. Arthritis is cramping
his left hand, and he travels constantly with his Advil.
   "The poor guy should be sitting at home," says Mario
Mosti, a Yankovic fan and one of the nation's last accordion
repairmen. The rest, he says, "are too old or dead." But, Mr.
Mosti says, Frankie "wants to die playing the accordion."
   Mr. Yankovic has a mission. "I went on the road to keep
polka alive," he says. In the course of his crusade, he won
the first Grammy for polka music in 1986 and at last count
was in three polka halls of fame. "You can call him the
godfather, the polka music god," says one worshiper, Carl
Rohwetter, publisher of the Polka News, a bimonthly
newsletter.
   "Polka music is the happiest music this side of heaven,
and when I see people happy I forget about travel and pain,"
says Mr. Yankovic, who inherited his first accordion from a
Slovenian boarder living at his parents' house in Cleveland
as payment for a bar bill.
   The son of Slovenian immigrants, Mr. Yankovic envisioned
making polka less babushka league and more all-American. He
was the first to sing polkas in English; traditionally, they
were performed in Croatian, Polish and Slavic. He traded the
heavy, ethnic Oom-pa-pas for smoother Ee-ii-ee-ii-ee-ii-oos,
and polished the polka look. Unlike other accordion players,
who were about as lively as metronomes, Mr. Yankovic hopped,
smiled and clapped. He once fired a poker-faced polka player
and supplied toupees for two bald banjo players because he
thought they looked silly singing love songs.
   Mr. Yankovic performed for Gen. George Patton and did TV
commercials for Teeny Weeny Weiner. He led the hit parade
with his 1949 favorite "Just Because," which sold a million
copies and was second that year only to Gene Autry's "Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer." Young women used to tear at his
clothes when he appeared in record stores in the '50s.
   With Mr. Yankovic's touch, polka entered its era of glitz.
When the Mocambo, a Hollywood haunt, decided to jazz up slow
Monday nights, it dumped swing bands and brought in Frankie
Yankovic and his Yanks. Apprehensive at first, Mr. Yankovic
lured stars like Rosalind Russell and Milton Berle onto the
floor with a familiar fox trot and midway through switched to
polka. "If you can cha-cha, you can polka," Bob Hope gushed
to a Hollywood columnist.
   Stella Lemard ("the `-sky' was taken off years ago," she
explains) knows polka. The 76-year-old, who is with Mrs.
Rigatti at the Yankovic show, grabs a matron from her table
and whisks her out to the floor. When her first partner
tires, Mrs. Lemard waltzes to the next table and grabs
another woman as Mr. Yankovic barrels into the Pennsylvania
Polka. "I love him," she says, her blue, cut-glass earrings
bobbing and white, thick-heeled sandals stomping. "I like
rock 'n' roll too," she whispers.
   Even those who can't hop and slide are energized by Mr.
Yankovic, hokey-pokeying in their seats. "It keeps the
circulation going," says Mary Dolinich, thrusting her right
arm in and her right arm out. Years ago when Mr. Yankovic
performed at a Canadian hospital, patients polka-ed in
wheelchairs.
   This sold-out matinee's crowd, where older women outnumber
older men by 10 to one, is typical of Mr. Yankovic's
following. They remember watching his "Polka Varieties" show,
the MTV of polka in its day, and listening to his hits on the
radio, like "When banana skins are falling" ("I'll come
sliding back to you"), and "How many burps in a bottle of
beer?"
   It's not that Mr. Yankovic hasn't tried to groom young
listeners. He's the only polka leader known to play "Born in
the U.S.A." on the accordion, and a few years back he revved
up "Hello Dolly" for his disco accordion album.
   But once rock 'n' roll came along, many producers,
recording companies and disk jockeys dropped polkas and Mr.
Yankovic like a hot kishka. (By the way, the kishka of the
famous polka "Who Stole the Kishka?" is a sausage of blood
and rice that apparently tastes so good it invites larceny.)
   Rock had its Woodstock, but polka had only Oktoberfests,
and somewhere along the line Polka became more a punchline
than an idiom. "It's the same thing as Polish jokes," says
Charles Keil, an ethnomusicologist at the State University of
New York at Buffalo, who is writing a book called "Polka
Happiness." "The ethnic working class has never been real
popular here."
   Still, Prof. Keil is amazed at the resiliency of Mr.
Yankovic, who has lasted longer than Mitch Miller's bouncing
ball, and of the polka itself. Thousands of small polka
bands-like The Polka Band Called Fred and Stas Bulanda and
his Average Polka Band -- thrive, as do polka cruises to
Hawaii and the Caribbean. Tony Petkovsek's daily radio polka
program is still going strong in Cleveland after 30 years,
and a professional dance company in Maryland holds polka
seminars in the Poconos.
   Polka fans, who have been waiting for a national hit
almost as long as Cub fans for a World Series, are now
looking for a polka rebirth. Events in Eastern Europe could
well inspire a return to ethnic roots, and a coming album
called "America, This Song's For You" will raise funds, a la
Farm Aid, to promote polka music as "American Music for the
1990s." A Polka News correspondent is urging polka lovers to
start a type of polka chain letter, with each fan promising
to bring a non-polka friend to an Oktoberfest.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Yankovic is doing his part to preach the
polka, spending up to eight hours a day returning fan mail
and listening to tapes submitted by aspiring 13-year-old
accordion players. He freely admits he's not the best
accordion player. But he's still America's favorite.
   It's a title he earned in the late 1940s. At that time,
each of the major recording studios decided to enter their
best polka band in a contest to name America's polka king.
Mr. Yankovic won 8 to 1. Then the contest was broadened to
include other forms of music, such as jazz, pitting Mr.
Yankovic against Duke Ellington.
   Mr. Yankovic beat the Duke and has been King since.

<TEXT>     My husband and I had often wondered about Jane's future, and decided she'd
never go for the wife-and-mother role.;   She and Michael had been living
together for years. Now here she was telling us the plans. End of August. A
quaint inn in Vermont. Afternoon ceremony.;   I thought perhaps we'd
underestimated the power of romance, so I offered to lend her my veil.;   My
husband suspected some underlying practical consideration. He offered to lend
her our crib.;   There was a long pause.;   Jane?;   "Well," she said.
"Actually . . . ";   The baby, whom they refer to as Gus, is due in December.
The bride wore off-white. A simple dress by a New York designer. Asymmetrical
neckline, cap sleeves. No waist.;   Her bouquet was a levelheaded bunch of day
lilies, her gray hair unadorned.;   The morning of the wedding, I'd stopped in
a bridal boutique and bought her the laciest garter in stock on the solid
hunch that it was not among the items in her trousseau.;   Everyone, even a
confirmed pragmatist like my old friend, deserves a little romantic
tradition.;   I've known Jane since college. We have suffered through each
other's broken hearts and twisted career paths. We have traveled together,
comforted each other and memorized each other's phone numbers. We've fought
and gone months without speaking.;   If we were married, we never would have
made it. But friendship can be more forgiving than love.;   Three years ago,
Jane quit her job with an architecture firm in New York, sold her East Village
studio and moved to Ohio with Michael.;   Maybe it was Ohio that changed her.
Living on a street of single-family homes with swing sets out back, maybe she
started to believe there was something to the classic tale of how monogamous
love can blossom into a happy family.;   Nah.;   There are too many glaring
reasons to be skeptical about the institution. Stratospheric divorce rates.
Battered wives. Infidelity.;   But two people who have lived together for
almost 10 years are no less vulnerable to the pain than a married couple. Jane
and Michael were as married as anyone. The only thing missing was the party.;
 There are so few indelible days in a lifetime. Weddings, I think, are the
best, full of hope and promise.;   How many other days can you remember so
vividly? What was worn, said and eaten. The weather. The music. I'm not saying
the memories are all so fond, of course. Weddings are symbolic occasions.
People tend to get delirious about details.;   But one advantage of marrying
later in life is that your parents have usually given up on you. By the time
you're 38, they are less likely to badger you about inviting your second
cousin's step-niece twice removed. They're just grateful.;   Jane and Michael
stood under a tree behind the inn. The minister, who had just nursed her baby
in the lobby before the ceremony, read from Ecclesiastes.;   "The Byrds made
this popular, but they didn't write it," she said. "To everything there is a
season . . .";   Friends and family proposed toasts and said the kinds of
appreciative, loving things they rarely find the need or occasion to say.
Michael's brothers told stories of tree-houses and truancy. His buddies paid
respect to his fierce independence.;   Jane's ex-roommates told her she was a
patient, loyal friend and a gifted artist. Her big sister said she was glad
Jane wasn't killed the day a sled ran over her, leaving tracks on the back of
her snowsuit. Everyone raised their wine glasses. Jane raised her club soda.
There were tears in her eyes.;   She cut the cake. Tossed her lilies to her
divorced younger sister. Then let Michael remove the garter, and throw it to
the crowd. All the men were either married or under age 12. They backed away.
It landed on the ballroom floor.;   No honeymoon in the Poconos. Jane and
Michael were closing on their house the next day. They had to find a fax
machine. The bank wouldn't approve the mortgage without a copy of their
marriage license.;   "And a time to every purpose under the heaven . . ."  </TEXT>

   Gypsy Moths Beset Residents

   INDIANA TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- People who are antsy about bugs
shouldn't read this story, and definitely shouldn't visit
Peggy Uminski right now. Because when Mrs. Uminski is asked
if that sound outside is rain, she replies: Oh no, that's
just the sound of thousands of caterpillars munching on
everything around the house and then excreting millions of
peppercorn-sized pellets.
   Gypsy moth season has arrived here in its grossest form.
In their current state, the insects are hairy caterpillars,
swarming over houses and devouring majestic oaks. They're
everywhere, from toilets to patio furniture, turning areas
all around Pittsburgh into an Indiana Jones nightmare. "It's
really like a grade B horror movie," says Launa Haney Post,
looking up at trees where two-inch caterpillars hang like
fuzzy black tinsel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And an uncivil war has broken out in small towns like
Murrysville over what to do about it. Sharon Malhotra
received angry phone calls at night. "Zealot]" "Fanatic]" Her
crime: She and her Citizens for Responsible Pest Management
are lobbying against the use of chemical pesticides, fearful
of the health effects. The callers, convinced that the moths
are a bigger threat than the spray, want to blast the insects
into chemical oblivion.
   "It gets to be a real donnybrook," says James Pierce,
staff scientist of Environmental Action, a Washington, D.C.,
organization that assists local opposition to chemical
pesticides. In one of Virginia's finest neighborhoods, he
recalls, the issue became so emotional that neighbors got
into fistfights, bullied each other's children and threatened
to kill each other's pets.
   There is no question that the gypsy moth is a pest, and
has been since 1869, when a French bug fancier, trying to
breed a better silk caterpillar in the U.S., brought some
over from Europe. Unfortunately, he forgot to close his
window and some escaped, causing moth mayhem in his hometown
of Medford, Mass. By the following year, caterpillars were so
thick in Medford that passers-by couldn't tell the color of
houses.
   Since then, the moths have spread south and west. They
arrived in Pennsylvania decades ago, first honeymooning in
the Poconos before pouncing on Pittsburgh, this year's hot
spot. They're expected to linger a few more years before
their feeding frenzy moves them southwest.
   To fight back, towns in the Pittsburgh area appointed
Gypsy Moth Coordinators, who help track and destroy the
caterpillars. Residents call gypsy moth hotlines and read
gyspy moth newsletters. In some schools, sixth graders have
raised moths for science class and written journals on the
life and death of caterpillars with names like Mitsy, Betsy
and Tootsie.
   There's even a gypsy moth song published by the American
Forestry Association -- the "Inch Along Song." Some of the
lyrics: "Worms we are, a moth we'll be, fat, happy and free.
In-ching a-long, inching a-long, in-ching a-long, just you
and me."
   Even the most ardent nature lovers are repulsed. "I hate
them," says Gary Stokum, manager of the Washington County
Conservation District. The moths' only redeeming quality is
that they die quickly. The caterpillars hatch in the spring
from eggs laid by last year's moths. Then they enter the pupa
stage -- tiny, beef-jerky-like things -- and emerge as moths
in July. In this last leg of life, female moths, who
fortunately are too fat to fly anywhere, lay quarter-sized
egg masses, each with about 500 eggs. The moths die by the
end of summer.
   The caterpillars are 24-hour eating machines. They trample
blindly over each other as they scale trees, lampposts and
barns in search of their Holy Grail -- the oak leaf. Once the
oaks are stripped, they'll eat anything green short of
Astroturf.
   They hide everywhere, trespassing No Trespassing signs,
cruising in old tires and lounging on patio furniture. They
hold people like Mrs. Uminski hostages in their own homes. On
Father's Day, the ravenous rampage was just too repulsive for
the Uminskis and their dinner guests. The menu was changed
from barbequed chicken to Shake 'n Bake and the party was
moved inside.
   She and her neighbors have become Raid-bearing Rambos.
They stab and crush the moths, using fly swatters, penknives,
machetes and ice picks, before drowning them in jugs of
bleach.
   Ms. Uminski says her four-year-old daughter used to panic
when she saw caterpillars. "Now she just stomps on them like
everyone else." The desperate haul out propane torches to
crisp the critters, unfortunately sometimes toasting trees as
well. And while most try to save valuable trees, the truly
vanquished cut them all down.
   "It's as much a financial and social problem as a
biological one," says Environmental Action's Mr. Pierce. It's
also a political can of worms. Here in Indiana Township, flag
burning doesn't hold a candle to gypsy moths as the No. 1
issue. Some residents are mobilizing against township
supervisors for refusing to participate in a state-sponsored
spray program because of liability concerns.
   "We want to vote them out," says Janet Giel, who found
caterpillars crawling on her closet and floating in her
toilet.
   Fred Rimmel of the Audubon Society refused any spray for
the society's 136-acre Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve in
Allegheny County, even though it could mean the loss of some
200-year-old oak trees. Some oak-loving, moth-hating society
members quit paying dues. Nearby residents blasted him in
letters to local newspapers for sentencing the mighty oaks to
death.
   Mr. Rimmel argues that the bacteria spray may affect other
caterpillars, which are food for young birds. Still, people
look at him disparagingly, he says, as a "right-to-lifer for
moths."
   The debate was neatly set in letters to the editor of a
small newspaper called the Ligonier Echo. Eric Oesterling, a
Westmoreland County agricultural agent, argued that the
chemical pesticide Dimilin, which is the most effective in
highly infested gypsy moth areas, is "one of the safest and
least toxic insecticides man has ever known. . . . By
comparison, it is less acutely toxic than either table salt
or aspirin."
   In response, two local doctors, Dale Fruman and N.K.
Malhotra, wrote that being "one of the least toxic
insecticides" is like being a little pregnant. The doctors
expressed concern about the long-term effects of all toxic
chemicals and noted that once Dimilin is broken down, one of
its byproducts has produced cancer in laboratory animals.
   "Mr. Oesterling may be willing to have his eggs with
Dimilin," they wrote. "We still put table salt on ours."
   Allegheny County officials initially planned to spray
100,000 acres this year. But only about 25,000 acres got
juiced, due partly to citizens' chemical angst, says Michael
Blumenthal, the state's forest pest management specialist.
"People get upset and worry about their kids and their health
when you say `spray,'" he says.
   Professional hit men have sprung up. One mothbuster, Mark
Ticehurst, formerly of the state's forest bureau, founded the
National Gypsy Moth Management Group Inc. of Landisburg, Pa.
"Gypsy moths are our bag," he says.
   The private consulting group of professional entomologists
and biologists has monitored and sprayed the moth population
in the well-heeled suburb of Fox Chapel, collecting $230,000.
The company also releases parasitic wasps and gnats to help
kill Fox Chapel's moths, provides education materials and
conducts town meetings.
   A federally funded program in Morgantown, W.Va., called
the Appalachian Integrated Pest Management Demonstration
Project, is trying to check the mating habits of gypsy moths.
In one project, the scent females use to lure male moths is
artificially reproduced and released into the environment.
The idea is to lead the male on a wild moth chase until he
dies.
   Scientists have also used the $7 million federal grant to
try to figure out a way to develop a sterile male moth to
compete with virile moths for the female.
   Erik Mollenhauer, a New Jersey education consultant, is
flitting across the country trying to sell his Just Say No to
gypsy moths campaign to teachers. He has a packet that
includes an inch-thick planning guide, a 9-minute videotape
and a gypsy moth board game that looks like a cross between
Monopoly and gypsy moth Trivial Pursuit, with questions like
"What is the nickname of the ground beetle that feeds on
gypsy moths?" (Answer: Caterpillar hunters.)
   Mr. Mollenhauer envisions children and parents together
embarking on search and destroy missions. As he says, "It's a
lot more effective than a picture in a post office saying
`Have you seen this bug?'"

<HL> Travel (A Special Report): On Business --- Travelin' Man: Bank Executive Is a Pro at Avoiding Hassles But Life Away From Home Is Still No Fun </HL>
<AUTHOR> Teri Agins </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   DICK HUBER JETTED to Sao Paulo five times last year.
He traveled to London, Mexico City, Caracas, Buenos Aires and Santiago twice.
And he also went to Tokyo and Quito, Ecuador.
All on expense account.

   For many who dream of jet-setting -- but rarely manage to get farther than a cabin in the Poconos -- Mr. Huber's life as a globe-trotter sounds romantic.

   But not to Mr. Huber.
"Let's face it," the 51-year-old international banker says a little wearily.
"Business travel ain't a whole lot of fun."

   In 28 years on the road, and in the air, Mr. Huber has missed more flights than a lot of people will ever take.
He's shared hotel rooms with other stranded strangers.
He rarely sees much more than the inside of offices and hotels.

   Moreover, he's been away from home for numerous family occasions -- most notably the birth of his third son.
While Mr. Huber tries to make up for it when he is at home, his traveling creates a certain hardship.
"You miss the companionship when he's away," says Roberta, his wife, who runs an Oriental bookshop in Manhattan, "the gossip, the totally insignificant but wonderful little day-to-day things that become a blur by the time he returns."

   By now, of course, Mr. Huber and his family are used to it.
A trim, energetic New Yorker, Mr. Huber is a career traveler, a product of the growing world of international trade and finance.
He's visited some 70 countries.
He's lived abroad three times, working for the Bank of Boston in Buenos Aires and for Citibank in Sao Paulo and Toyko, and speaks Portuguese, Spanish and rudimentary Japanese.
In 1981, while based in Tokyo, he was on the road 187 days.

   After returning to the States in 1983, he shuttled several times a month to Latin America, London and the Far East for Citicorp Investment Bank.
In late January, he joined Chase Manhattan Bank as an executive vice president.
Week 2 found him on an intense, five-day swing to London and Tokyo.

   Traveling abroad for a multinational bank isn't without perks, needless to say.
Mr. Huber doesn't fly cattle class and stay in run-down pensiones to pinch pennies.
He rarely bothers with crowded subways or grimy taxis, instead getting a chauffeur from the time he lands till he takes off.

   Still, even going first class doesn't make Mr. Huber immune to the hassles of flight delays and other glitches that can botch his meticulous schedules.

   When it comes to international travel, Murphy's Law holds true: anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
Over the years, Mr. Huber has learned to always assume the worst.
The first hint of mechanical trouble on a plane sends him scrambling to book an alternative flight.
"I'm convinced that flight delays progress geometrically the longer you wait to act," he says.
So last year, he quickly staked out the Air Paraguay counter in Recife, in northeast Brazil, when his Air France flight to London was delayed, and secured one of the last available seats on the only other flight to Europe.

   On a layover in Madrid, mechanical difficulties stalled Air Paraguay.
Mr. Huber lost no time abandoning the flight and boarding another that got him to London in time to keep an afternoon appointment.
He later learned that his original Air France flight was held overnight in Recife.

   Getaways aren't always possible, however.
As he was trying to leave Venezuela one night a few years back, a storm knocked out the power at Caracas' airport and all flights were canceled.
Elbowing his way through the airport crowd, he grabbed a cab to search for a nearby hotel.
The only place he could find was a seedy joint -- and he had to share a room with another stranded passenger.

   Even when things go smoothly, the endless hours in airports and airplanes are numbing.
"My idea of a good flight is one where I have slept most of the way," he says.
For that reason, Mr. Huber avoids airlines that stress their service.
"I don't want to be tapped on the shoulder by those girls that ask you for the third time, 'Are you sure you don't want breakfast?'" he notes.
He wears eyeshades and earphones to dissuade talkative seatmates.
When he can't sleep, he says, "I just sit back in a chair and get myself into a catatonic Zen state."

   As for the in-flight movie, he knows he won't like it, and he has already seen it anyway.
"I must have seen 'Karate Kid II' a half-dozen times," he says.

   Like most seasoned travelers, Mr. Huber has learned to pack light.
He dresses casually for plane trips, in turtleneck sweater and loose loafers, with one "beat-up navy canvas carry-on bag that a thief won't clip."
To make sure it doesn't get lost, he carries it on the plane.
He packs no more than one shirt for each day of travel, even when he has evening engagements in the tropics. (Of course, this can lead to problems, too.
Occasionally the hotel laundry is so slow that he's had to wash his own underwear with soap and dry it in his room.)

   For vacationers to exotic, faraway places, doing what they want after they arrive is worth the inconveniences of getting there.
For Mr. Huber, there's little time to see anything (assuming he hasn't already seen it years ago).

   He's usually in a city a scant 48 hours, his schedule crammed with meetings and business functions from early morning until late evening.
A visit from headquarters, Mr. Huber believes, disrupts the bank's staffs in foreign countries.
"The objective is to get out of their way so they can get back to work," he says.
His typical activities are visiting important clients, closing deals or intervening in delicate business situations.
He adds, "I'm only there to accomplish what they can't do."

   So once he lands, Mr. Huber hits the ground running.
On occasion when his flight is late, he takes a sponge bath in the airplane and heads straight for a meeting.
Chauffeurs meet him at the airport and transport him about town, but never in showy stretch limousines or Mercedes.

   Once he arrived in Buenos Aires, and was met by three husky bodyguards.
"I told the driver to get these guys outta here," he says.
In 1969, a sniper shot his driver in Rio de Janeiro. (Mr.
Huber wasn't in the car.)
"The objective is to be inconspicuous as a foreigner, to blend in," he says.
Traveling with an entourage "is like putting an arrow over your head to flag you as somebody important."

   A long day at work often is followed by a long night.
Although Mr. Huber dodges most formal events such as long-winded inaugurations and courtesy calls, he invariably gets roped into business obligations that are always and lamentably held at "the best French restaurant in town." (Mr.
Huber prefers local cuisine -- "wandering through the stalls in South Korean streets and grabbing a dish of this or that," for example -- but his local staff likes to impress him.)
In Korea, he must endure at least one kisaeng party a trip, a late-hours stag gathering of open-ended toasting.
"You can't just sip one drink and be polite," he says.

   But Mr. Huber discourages the presence of wives at staff dinners.
"Nothing is worse that going to a dinner and getting stuck sitting between Mrs. Perez and Mrs. Garcia, who you have nothing in common with," he says.
"You end up talking with the whole night about the servant problem in Guayaquil."

   All this leaves precious little time for fun, although there can be some special moments.
Mr. Huber likes to visit clients at their factories or plantations, which gives him a whiff of the countryside.
On long trips to Asia he schedules weekends in the Philippines, which offers "some of the best diving in the world," he says.
And last year, when Citicorp sponsored an overseas tour of the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Huber attended an exhilarating performance in Bombay, India, the hometown of the orchestra's conductor, Zubin Mehta; Mr. Huber sat in the front row between Mr. Mehta's mother and wife.

   After all these years, most foreign cities blur together, but he is partial to bustling locales.
His favorites: London and Sao Paulo.
"They're cosmopolitan cities with a lot going on," he explains.
His least favorite: Tehran, which he visited in the late 1970s after the Iranian revolution.
"Usually you can say something nice about a place, if it's not the food, it's the people," he says, but Tehran is "the only city where I've visited which has no redeeming qualities whatsoever."

   When Mr. Huber returns home, things don't slow down much -- in part because he makes a special effort to devote time to his family.
Once, his wife recalls, he rushed home from the airport after a long trip abroad, changed into a tuxedo and then took her out to compensate her for missing formal events she won't attend alone during his absences.
"Dick is really remarkable, unusually organized and efficient," she says, in his juggling of business and family obligations. (Mrs.
Huber also joins her husband on one or two trips a year to Asia, where she can do business for her bookshop.)

   While Mr. Huber may find business travel a bit tedious, the Hubers often head overseas on vacation -- but not for sightseeing.

   For the past two years the Hubers have been volunteer research assistants for Earthwatch, a non-profit group.
Last year they went on an archeological dig at Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean and in 1986 they studied the homing behavior of coastal fish in the Canary Islands in the Atlantic.
The trips involve cave crawling, camping, digging and hiking "with a group of people who are intellectual and highly stimulating in a different way. . . .
They don't know or care absolutely anything about investment banking and that's just what we want.
We love it," Mr. Huber says.

   And there is one place Mr. Huber hasn't been to that he still would like to visit: Tibet.
Why?
"It's supposed to be exotic and I've read a lot about it."

Bid for Caesars
Of $28 a Share

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, disclosed a bid to acquire the shares of Caesars World Inc. he doesn't own for $28 each, or $725.2 million.

   Under terms of the offer, which begins today, Mr. Sosnoff would acquire Los Angeles-based Caesars World, a profitable hotel-casino and real estate concern, through MTS Acquisition Corp., a company formed for the proposed purchase.
The $28-a-share offer is set to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST April 4.

   Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars World's largest holder with the equivalent of a 13.6% stake, or about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding.
The $28 price values all of Caesars World at $840 million.

   The offer is conditioned on the approval of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, the Nevada Gaming Commission and the State Gaming Control Board of Nevada.
Those agencies regulate casinos in those states.
Mr. Sosnoff also must have sufficient financing before the offer can be completed.

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Caesars World closed at $24.25 a share, up 25 cents.

   Mr. Sosnoff said in an interview last night that financing of the offer would be managed by PaineWebber Inc. and Marine Midland Banks Inc., Buffalo, N.Y.

   Mr. Sosnoff declined to elaborate on why he was bidding for the company, pending a news release, which he said would be issued "shortly."
He said, however, that he believes that Caesars World's management is "pretty good."

   In Los Angeles, a Caesars World spokesman said the company hadn't been aware of the offer and that it would need time to study it before making a comment.

   Mr. Sosnoff, chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., has held a stake in Caesars World since 1983.
Last September, Mr. Sosnoff filed for permission under federal antitrust laws to raise his stake in the company to as much as 25%.
Mr. Sosnoff has asked several times for a seat on the board of Caesars World, a move that the company has rejected.

   Some industry analysts suggested that Mr. Sosnoff, by bidding for Caesars World, may be hoping to attract the attention of other potential bidders.

   "Marty has been trying to put the company in play for a long time," said Daniel Lee, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who follows the gaming industry.
"I'm not sure he's serious."

   Mr. Lee said that Mr. Sosnoff had plenty of opportunities in the past to increase his Caesars World stake, and had offered to sell stock to Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer, and others.
"Why did he wait until the stock was hitting new highs to make a tender offer?
It's a little puzzling."
Mr. Trump couldn't be reached for comment.

   A source close to Mr. Sosnoff said, however, that the offer was a "real" one.
The source added that "commitments from the bank have been made and PaineWebber will do the subordinated financing."
The source said that Mr. Sosnoff first retained PaineWebber in December 1986 and that the decision to make a tender offer for Caesars World is one "that he hasn't been planning out for a long time."

   Caesars World long has been known as a casino that appeals to high rollers, although it recently embarked on a program to attract middle-income and lower-income players, too.
Its chairman and chief executive officer, Henry Gluck, is credited with having turned around the company.

   When Mr. Gluck took the helm at Caesars World in 1983, the company posted a loss of more than $21 million.
For the fiscal year ended July 31, 1986, the company posted net income of $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million.

   In the second quarter ended Jan. 31, the company reported net rose 6.8% to $12.6 million, or 41 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter's $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share.
Revenue grew 16% to $190.4 million from $163.8 million.

   Caesars World owns Caesars Palace, its flagship hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
The company also owns a hotel-casino in Lake Tahoe, Nev., and another in Atlantic City, N.J.
The company's holdings also include four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos and seven acres of undeveloped land along the Atlantic City boardwalk.

   While industry analysts generally have praised Mr. Gluck and Caesars World's financial performance, some have said recently that the stock market long has undervalued the company's stock.
Mr. Lee said that "$28 (a share) is getting pretty close to what Caesars is worth."

   Besides his Caesars World holding, Mr. Sosnoff also has bought large stakes for himself or his firm's clients in recent years in such companies as Triangle Industries Inc., Loews Corp., Chrysler Corp. and New York Times Co.
In the past, Mr. Sosnoff always has been a passive investor, buying and selling for investment rather than takeover purposes.

   Last year, Mr. Sosnoff sold a 20% stake in his investment management firm to the public through a $30 million offering of about 1.8 million shares.
He also sold $30 million of convertible debentures.
Atalanta/Sosnoff had said it wanted the money to expand and for acquisition of financial companies.

   In the world of set and costume design, Santo
Loquasto is one of Broadway's big guns. He has taken home a Tony
Award two years in a row to prove it.
   Last year, his atmospheric re-creation of an old theatrical
hangout on New York's Lower East Side for ``Cafe Crown'' was named
Broadway's best set design. So realistic was the setting that it
now sits in storage in New Jersey while plans are made to use its
dark wooden bar, tables and chairs in a real-life restaurant.
   This year, Loquasto's stylish 1920s wardrobe for the employees
and guests of the musical ``Grand Hotel'' picked up the
best-costume award. No word on whether the bellhop outfits are
wanted by Hilton or Hyatt.
   And the man can talk with feeling about the profession that has
been his life for some 30 years. Ask him, for example, about what
makes a good costume, and the shaggy, bearded Loquasto speaks with
authority.
   ``It's all about telling stories,'' he said the other day during
an interview at Barbara Matera Ltd., the shop which made the
costumes for ``Grand Hotel.''
   ``A good costume tells us an appropriate amount of information
about the character, but not necessarily everything,'' the designer
says. ``You might not want too much revealed. For example, you
might not want the villain to be twirling a mustache and cane.''
   The 45-year-old designer doesn't work just in the theater. He
has also made a name for himself in dance, collaborating with
choreographers such as Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp, and in the
movies, where directors such as Woody Allen depend on his sharp eye.
   Good costumes, he adds, take in practical considerations, too _
like movement and comfort. For dance or for musical theater, he
says, you want to reveal or expand upon a performer's movement, not
obscure it.
   ``Revealing it in the purest sense would be wearing as little as
possible,'' Loquasto says. ``Or revealing as clean a line as
possible by adding a shirt or a skirt or whatever which has the
right weight or movement to it so that the costume will float or
swing or cling.''
   Loquasto's design career began at age 15, when the stage-struck
youth got a job doing sets and costumes for a summer theater in the
Poconos. He was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and later raised in
Easton and Bethlehem. Mom ran a beauty shop; dad was a salesman.
The only show-business connection was a great aunt who had worked
in silent-film Keystone Kops comedies.
   Loquasto hasn't stopped working in the theater since those
summer stock days. After graduation from King's College in
Wilkes-Barre, there were journeys to the Yale School of Drama to
study design and an apprenticeship at the Williamstown Theater
Festival in Massachusetts as well as a lot of work in regional
theaters such as Hartford Stage and Long Wharf, both in Connecticut.
   Broadway first saw his designs in the 1970s. Among his successes
were ``That Championship Season'' and ``American Buffalo.'' He won
his first Tony Award for costumes in 1977 for the Lincoln Center
production of ``The Cherry Orchard.''
   Besides Loquasto, ``Grand Hotel'' has two experienced production
designers _Tony Walton who did the massive, two-tiered unit set of
reflective pillars and Jules Fisher, who handled the lighting.
   Loquasto joined the musical last summer after director Tommy
Tune began a workshop production. In the workshop, the actors wore
their own clothes, augmented by hats and overcoats.
   At the time, the script for the show, which is set in 1928
Berlin, still was evolving, and Tune didn't want the designer to
rely on it.
   ``All I had to go on was a cast breakdown,'' Loquasto recalls.
``Tommy and I went through it at a meeting. He said what he thought
about the characters and what he thought was important to know
about them.
   ``There also were certain images that Tommy and Tony had already
hit upon and that they thought were wonderful _ pictures of
bellhops and certain books on Berlin,'' the designer says. ``So I
just sort of collected all this stuff and started working.''
   Because ``Grand Hotel'' is a relatively spartan unit, a one-set
production, it is the livery in the hotel which gives the audience
a sense of architectural detail in many ways, according to Loquasto.
   ``The form of the lobby was punctuated by the arrangement of
bellhops and other hotel staff members,'' he says. The designer
used the same color _ many shades of brown extending almost to a
rusty red _ to suggest to theatergoers the flavor of a luxury hotel.
   ``It's not something that hits you over the head, but it does
fill out the space and expand on it,'' he says.
   ``In `Grand Hotel,' we also did not want to have masses of
clothing,'' Loquasto adds. ``People don't really change their
costumes a lot. It's not like a huge show. It's less than 50
costumes. What they have are spats and shoes and hats and gloves
and cuff links and overcoats. It's a big overcoat production.
   ``The hardest costumes in `Grand Hotel' were the secretaries',''
he says. ``Historically, those uniforms were not very attractive,
and I wanted the girls to look terrific and be very individual. We
did it in the subtleties of the fit and the fabric so that the
dresses moved quite well even though they looked like rather dowdy
uniforms.''

   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel may go down in history as the only Machiavelli in Ronald Reagan's court.

   A few months ago Mr. Hodel suggested that the wearing of wide-brim hats, neckerchiefs and other devices for protection against strong sunlight would greatly reduce the millions of deaths due to skin cancer that had been forecast to result from destruction of the ozone layer above Earth by chlorofluorocarbons.

   It was a sound suggestion and one that Mexican peasants, Arab sheiks, Wyoming cowboys, Argentine gauchos, Australian sheepherders, Chesapeake Bay crabbers, and farmers all over the world have been following for a long time.
If Mr. Reagan had protected his nose with a sunscreen lotion during his days as a lifeguard, he might not be having problems with skin cancer of the nose today.

   Nevertheless, Mr. Hodel was hooted at so vigorously by Sierra Club members and other "sophisticated" environmentalists who long to save the world from itself by sweeping measures that do not depend on common sense that he was forced to retreat.

   (The catcalls were almost as loud as those that greeted President Reagan's truthful claim in 1980 that trees and other forms of vegetation release billions of tons of organic pollutants into the air each year.
The jeering then was so intimidating that the president never brought the subject up again despite the fact that the autumnal haze in the Poconos, the yearlong blue smog in the Great Smoky Mountains, the overwhelming odor of orange blossoms in Florida each spring and thousands of other natural phenomena have kept proving him right, year after year.)

   But Mr. Hodel is a bold fellow.
He now has come up with a proposal that has thrown his foes into a state of confusion and may teach the nation some things about the Sierra Club that the club would like to keep secret.

   Mr. Hodel has proposed to tear down the 300-foot-high dam across the valley of the Tuolumne River in California, drain the lake behind it and convert what was the bed of the lake into an addition to Yosemite National Park.
Since the Sierra Club has long been opposed to dams as a matter of principle and in favor of adding to national parks, it might be assumed that its members are cheering, but this is not the case.

   It does make a difference whose ox gets gored.
The dam across the Tuolumne forms the Hetch Hetchery reservoir, which produces a good portion of the water and electricity required by San Francisco and its environs, where many Sierra Club members live.
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and many other Democrats are denouncing Mr. Hodel for going too far in his efforts to restore the nation to its pristine purity of bygone years.

   Mr. Hodel almost certainly will not succeed in this proposal, but he has succeeded in bringing confusion to his foes.
While a mind as fertile as his hardly needs advice about how to keep the opposition confused, let me make a few suggestions anyway.

   For example, he might return to the matter of skin cancer caused by depletion of the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons and propose that all automobile air conditioners be removed and the refrigerant in them recovered and burned to less stable compounds in a high-temperature incinerator.
All car air conditioners use chlorofluorocarbons as the refrigerant, and they all leak because of the vibrations in the automobiles as they move along the highway.
Removing air conditioners would help protect the ozone layer, even though it might create some resentment in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Dallas, Miami and just about all other points south of Maine.
However, as the Sierra Club is fond of telling us, people should be willing to put up with small inconveniences designed to promote the common good.

   If the above proposal is not sufficiently controversial to suit Mr. Hodel's Machiavellian schemes, he could propose that the federal government buy up all of Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa and convert the whole territory into one vast public park where the buffalo and the prairie dog could roam as freely as they did in bygone days.
After all, when the framers of the Constitution were doing their job, the nation got along without a single bushel of corn, wheat or soybeans from these three states.
At least a few members of the Sierra Club should applaud this proposal even though wide-hatted farmers out there might object and lose patience with the club.

   Finally, there is the matter of electromagnetic waves from power lines doing harm to people who live near such modern devices.
There is speculation that these waves may cause cancer, and it might be argued that the way to avoid such hazards is to keep people a safe distance away from power lines.
But who can say what is a safe distance?
Such energy is detectable at the distance of a mile or more.
So Mr. Hodel might propose to protect the public by ordering the immediate removal of all power lines throughout the nation.
After all, our founding fathers and the fathers of some members of the Sierra Club got along without power lines.

   Even if Mr. Hodel does not resort to any of these extended strategies, he already has created enough confusion among the ranks of his detractors to guarantee him a more respectful audience the next time he comes up with something as sound as his suggestion that people try to avoid prolonged exposure to strong sunlight.

   Democrat Theo Mitchell is making scant
headway in his bid to become the nation's second black elected
governor, and some South Carolina Democrats complain the candidate
has done little to help himself.
   Mitchell's campaign also has had to compete for attention with a
statehouse bribery scandal that so far has brought the indictments
of five state legislators.
   ``The only issue anyone wants to talk about is ethics,'' said
Lynn Stokes, a veteran of other Democratic campaigns.
   Democratic activists say Mitchell's campaign suffers from poor
organization and a lack of publicity.
   ``He's making little or no headway,'' said Charles T. ``Bud''
Ferillo, a Democratic consultant.
   Mitchell's campaign ``has not demonstrated any seriousness,''
said Samuel Tenenbaum, a key Democratic fund-raiser who has
contributed $1,000 to the Mitchell camp.
   Mitchell, however, maintains his campaign is in good health.
   ``I am elated at the momentum,'' he said. ``I don't understand
what the commotion is all about.''
   Mitchell, a lawyer and state senator who has spent 16 years in
the General Assembly, is hoping to follow the path of Virginia's
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who last year became the nation's first
elected black governor.
   But with less than 60 days before the Nov. 6 general election,
Mitchell faces long odds in his attempt to defeat first-term
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Earl Black, a professor at the University of South Carolina and
an expert on Southern politics, said a landslide Campbell victory
would devastate Democrats, who have long dominated South Carolina
politics.
   ``No Republican in South Carolina has ever had a send-off like
that,'' Black said.
   Some Democrats say Mitchell has done little to help himself.
   ``If I were running the campaign, I would have press conferences
every week on some issue,'' said Stokes. ``You have to draw a
crowd.''
   Activists say the campaign seems to have no organization beyond
a few people at its Greenville headquarters.
   ``You've got to establish a grassroots campaign. It's a
hackneyed phrase, but it's true,'' said a Democrat who is involved
in another statewide campaign. ``(Mitchell) could be in the Poconos
blue-fishing for all I know.''
   Mike Hart, who manages Mitchell's campaign, bristles at such
talk, insisting that the campaign has the assistance of several top
Democrats, including former Gov. Dick Riley and Charleston Mayor
Joe Riley.
   In addition, Hart said, Mitchell has coordinators in each of the
state's 46 counties. The campaign also has three top coordinators.
   ``We have a massive undertaking going on,'' Hart said.
   Ms. Stokes and several other Democrats said it may be impossible
for Campbell to get reporters to focus on any story that does not
relate to the bribery scandal, in which three state lawmakers have
pleaded guilty.
   Democratic state Rep. David Beasley, imposing his own grading
system on a potential Mitchell press conference, said the bribery
scandal takes ``what initially would be a `B' story, and it makes
it a `D' story.''
   Det Bowers, who is managing Democratic Lt. Gov. Nick Theodore's
re-election bid, said Mitchell must make stronger efforts to get
attention in the midst of the scandal.
   ``Any challenger has to be innovative and creative. And you've
got to be more creative to slice through that,'' Bowers said.
   Mitchell said he does not want to publicize all campaign
appearances for safety reasons. He also said some reporters are
biased in favor of Campbell and refuse to give him attention.
   ``Some reporters have written condescendingly about the
campaign,'' he said.
   Mitchell has several times questioned the racial motivation
behind the federal bribery investigation, and those accusations
have received some press attention.
   Only one of the five indicted lawmakers is black. But six more
present and former legislators last week were identified as
conspirators in the scandal, five of whom are black. A black
circuit judge, who is currently suspended, was also named. None of
the seven has been charged.
   Mitchell has said he turned down a lobbyist's offer of a
campaign contribution in exchange for a vote on a betting bill and
believes he was targeted in the FBI sting because he is running for
governor.
   ``Certainly it's a disproportionate number of black legislators
that were targeted,'' he said last month.
   Republicans say the main problem with Mitchell's gubernatorial
bid is that he is too liberal for the state's voters. State GOP
Chairman Barry Wynn said Mitchell is ``out of touch with what we
think is mainstream South Carolina.''
   Mitchell, meanwhile, describes himself as a supporter of
``fundamental, mainstream values'' and the ``God-given rights'' of
all people, including workers, women and homosexuals.
   He accuses Campbell of ``trying to take political advantage'' of
the bribery scandal in proposing ethics reforms. He also says the
governor has ``catered to the wealthy and privileged'' at the
expense of poor, elderly and working-class people.
   With the traditional Labor Day campaign kickoff now past,
Democrats say Mitchell must begin moving earnestly very soon.
   ``If you aren't within close striking distance about 30 days
before the election, it's very difficult to win,'' Bowers said.
``By Oct. 1, you've got to be within several points.''

<HEAD>Man Held Without Bond In Appalachian Trail Slayings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Appalachian Trail Conference
officials expressed relief Sunday at the arrest of a man charged
with the slayings of two hikers killed in their sleeping bags along
the Maine-to-Georgia path.
   David ``Casey'' Horn, 38, was arrested Friday in Harpers Ferry
on a fugitive from justice charge, said Jefferson County Magistrate
Patricia Noland. Horn remained in custody without bail Sunday
pending an extradition hearing.
   Noland said Horn was wanted on two homicide charges in
Pennsylvania in connection with the Sept. 13 killings of Molly
LaRue, 25, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and Geoffrey Logan Hood, 26, of
Signal Mountain, Tenn.
   ``We're on pins and needles to hear word and get him back
here,'' said Pennsylvania State Police Cpl. Dan Sullivan, who heads
the murder investigation.
   Brian King, a spokesman for the Appalachian Trail Conference in
Harpers Ferry, said Horn was arrested by U.S. Park Service rangers
when he entered the historic Eastern Panhandle town.
   ``A hiker saw this person answering the description coming
across the bridge into Harpers Ferry,'' King said. ``Three park
rangers stopped him and took him in for questioning, and they held
him for the Pennsylvania State Police and the West Virginia State
Police.''
   King, whose voluntary group oversees the entire 2,160-mile
trail, said hikers were relieved that a suspect had been arrested.
   He said about 200 people attended a ceremony Saturday to open a
new route at Boiling Springs, Pa.
   ``It was announced about an hour before it started and relief is
the best way to describe it,'' he said. ``It's been a very bad
eight days for the people who love the trail.''
   Thurston Griggs, president of the Mountain Club of Maryland,
which is responsible for the section of trail where the murders
occurred, said he was pleased authorities were able to make an
arrest.
   ``I'm disappointed it was somebody using the trail,'' Griggs
said Sunday from his home in Baltimore.
   Noland said an extradition hearing before Jefferson County
Circuit Judge Thomas Steptoe would be held within the next few
days. Steptoe had an unpublished telephone number and could not be
reached for comment Sunday.
   The two Appalachian Trail hikers were killed in their sleeping
bags before dawn near Duncannon, Pa., a rural community about 10
miles north of Harrisburg. Ms. LaRue was stabbed repeatedly. Hood
was shot three times.
   Horn, who told police he is from Loris, S.C., was arraigned
Friday night and has remained in the Eastern Regional Jail in
Martinsburg.
   ``I informed him of the charges that had been lodged aainst him
and read him his rights and informed him there would be no bail,''
Noland said Sunday. ``He was very quiet and cooperative and just
acknowledged his rights.''
   Horn could be back in Pennsylvania in as little as a week if he
does not fight extradition.
   Sullivan said he could not comment on whether police had any
other suspects, but a state police news release Saturday said
investigators had sought one individual.
   About 1,500 people use the trail every year. The last slaying on
the trail was in 1988 near Shippensburg, Pa., about 38 miles
southwest of Duncannon.

   John Sullivan's lawless young life was
already careening out of control by the time the 12-year-old struck
and killed two people with a stolen car while trying to outrun the
cops.
   ``I knew sooner or later there was going to be an accident,''
said Pauline Payne, the 72-year-old great-grandmother who raised the
boy from infancy after his unwed parents abandoned him. ``I knew he
was going to do the wrong thing.''
   Now, she said, ``There's nothing I can say but cry.''
   John L. Sullivan III, a wisp his family called Johnny Boy,
admitted responsibility for the Oct. 24 deaths of a father of nine
children and an 11-year-old girl. He's now serving four years at a
maximum security lockup for juveniles in rural northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   He was a street-savvy career criminal before age 10, when his
first arrest was recorded _ for stealing $327 from under his
great-grandmother's pillow. His family said he was stealing bicycles
years before that.
   His rap sheet includes 13 arrests, five for stealing cars, in the
last two years. He escaped five times from minimum-security juvenile
homes, committing more crimes every time he hit the streets.
   Johnny Boy, who turned 13 on Dec. 12, was on the loose at the
time of his fatal joyride, although he was supposed to be under
watch, awaiting placement in a secure state lockup that was too
crowded to take him right away.
   How could a boy so young get into so much trouble? Why didn't
anybody stop him?
   A litany of failure offers clues: a broken home, a guardian too
old to keep up with Johnny Boy, lack of resources in a social
services system that should have intervened before things got out of
control and an overcrowded juvenile justice system ill-equipped for
criminals so young.
   ``We normally don't get kids that young in that kind of
trouble,'' said Mingo Stroeber, an attorney with the Defender
Association of Philadelphia, which handled the case.
   ``There are very few programs equipped to deal with kids that
young. Nobody seemed to know what to do with him,'' Miss Stroeber
said. ``These kids are victims. His family failed him. The dependent
child system failed him. The juvenile court system failed him. We as
a society failed.''
   Others labeled him incorrigible.
   ``There are bad seeds. I've never seen one like this. He had no
appreciation for Western values,'' said Family Court Judge Frank
Reynolds.
   Johnny Boy exudes a peculiar combination of street-smart
toughness and moppet charm. Prosecutors consider him a corrupt
man-child who manipulates people to get his way. His lawyers thought
him lovable enough to adopt.
   He caused a crash that killed two people, then asked for crayons
and a coloring book in jail.
   He bought flowers and cards for his great-grandmother on Mother's
Day, then swiped her cash as she slept.
   He could steal a car in seconds, but because he stands just 5
feet tall and weighs 100 pounds, he had to sit on umbrellas, jackets
and other makeshift booster seats to help him see over the steering
wheel.
   Today, when most boys his age are in junior high school, John
Sullivan is living behind 12-foot-high chain-link fences topped with
barbed wire at the North Central Treatment Facility in Danville, Pa.
   Johnny Boy's lifetime of trouble began just months after he was
born. He was given to his paternal great-grandmother by a mother who
didn't want him and a father who is a confessed murderer.
   Pauline Payne raised him as best she could in the nasty North
Philadelphia neighborhood.
   His father, John Sullivan Jr., 32, pleaded guilty in October to
third-degree murder for stabbing his girlfriend, who he said had
been unfaithful. Sullivan was also charged with attempted murder in
1977 and with robbery, conspiracy and drunken driving in 1982.
   No one knows what happened to his mother, Lena Daniels. She is
believed dead, possibly murdered, and may have spent time in a North
Carolina prison, according to fragments gleaned from 12 interviews
with acquaintances and authorities. Johnny Boy, who wasn't made
available for an interview, didn't know her at all.
   ``His mother was wild,'' said Mrs. Payne. ``Neither one (mother
or father) was going to take care of him.''
   Mrs. Payne has lived in a nursing home since May, when she broke
her leg in a fall. In an interview, a reporter's mention of Johnny
Boy made her shiver.
   ``His legs are longer than mine and younger, too,'' she said. ``I
couldn't keep up with him. There are lots of things you can't do
when you get up in age. I knowed he was going to get into trouble.''
   The first hint came when he was 7. Ghetto gangs appeared outside
his great-grandmother's rowhouse at night and whistled for him to
come out and romp.
   ``He got with the bad crowd, started stealing bikes, stealing
cars and driving cars,'' said Mrs. Payne. ``He wasn't a bad little
boy. He just got in with them older boys.''
   She said she tried to keep Johnny Boy out of trouble and gave him
love. ``He'd come and look at me with them pitiful eyes and ask for
a dollar. I'd give that little boy my heart. He knowed I was
soft-hearted.''
   But there was no one else to head off trouble.
   ``This kid had a poor hand dealt to him. He was not given the
tools to make it,'' said Gerald Stanshine, an attorney with the
Defender Association.
   ``He's been on the streets more or less raising himself,'' added
Harvey Crudup, executive director of a juvenile detention center.
``The reason it came to everybody's attention is that he killed two
people. He probably could have gone on stealing cars for years.''
   Johnny Boy's first arrest was July 16, 1986, for stealing $327
from his great-grandmother. Mrs. Payne turned him in but later
dropped the charges.
   Before that month was out, he was arrested three times for
robbery and once for arson.
   Last spring, he was arrested for theft and for unauthorized use
of an auto. More charges of car theft and running away followed in
June.
   On July 5, he was sentenced to a state lockup at Loysville and
given a transfer date of Sept. 6 because no space was immediately
available. Johnny Boy was placed in a juvenile home that was no
match for him.
   Three times, he fled and was re-arrested. Each time, he was
charged with theft, receiving stolen property and unauthorized use
of an auto.
   To hold him, authorities wanted to put him in the Youth Study
Center, the city's only maximum-security lockup for juveniles. But
the 105-bed facility was 57 kids over its limit. And under a 1987
court order, the city agreed not to take anyone younger than 13.
   The courts sent him back to a home that had locks on the doors
and windows, but no bars.
   ``I couldn't hold him because it's against the law,'' said
Reynolds, the Family Court judge. ``It broke my heart.''

<HEAD>AG Sues Adoption Agency He Says Sold Babies To Highest Bidder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has filed a civil lawsuit against the
operators of an illegal adoption agency that amounted to ``a
large-scale baby selling business,'' State Attorney General Bob
Abrams said.
   The agency, based in New York City and in Scranton, Pa., sold
babies to the highest bidder for prices of up to $36,000, Abrams
charged Tuesday.
   The agency, Childhaven of Northeastern Pennsylvania, exploited
both the biological mothers and the adoptive parents, he said.
   Abrams did not file criminal charges against the operators of
the business, identified as Harriet and Lawrence Lauer of Brooklyn
and their attorney, Seymour Fenichel of Manhattan.
   The Lauers operated a similar business in Florida until 1982,
when a Dade County Circuit Court judge ordered them to stop,
according to Lanie Accles, a spokeswoman for the attorney general.
   ``We're looking for restitution for people who we feel were
charged unconscionable sums of money,'' Ms. Accles said.
   Ms. Accles would not identify the evidence found during a Monday
night search of the Lauer's home and could not say whether criminal
charges would be filed.
   Mrs. Lauer and Fenichel did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
   State Supreme Court Judge Leonard Cohen signed a temporary
restraining order barring Childhaven from continuing any illegal
adoption activities and freezing its assets, Abrams said.
   The Lauers have never been licensed by New York state to place
children for adoption and are no longer licensed in Pennsylvania,
Abrams said.

3 SLAIN ON POMONA STREET BY HAIL OF BULLETS FROM TRUCK

<TEXT>
<P>
Friends and relatives of Cornelio Perez Ruiz sat stone-faced Sunday under a
lemon tree on the quiet, sun-baked cul-de-sac in Pomona where earlier the young
man and two friends had been shot to death.
</P>
<P>
Perez, who turned 18 a week ago; Vincent Salazar, 20, and Eduardo Cruz, 17,
were gunned down outside Perez's home on Lee Place about 2 a.m. Sunday as they
walked home from a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were seeking three to six armed men riding in a small truck
who had argued with the three victims at the store, then opened fire on them
with pistols and a semiautomatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
"My son was a good boy," Primitivo Perez, 66, said in Spanish as he sat in a
folding chair on his front lawn, a straw hat shading his face. "And now they
took him from me. What can I say? I know nothing. I do not know why this
happened."
</P>
<P>
The victims did not appear to be affiliated with a gang, police said. But
detectives suspect that the gunmen may belong to one of the four or five local
Latino gangs.
</P>
<P>
Gang violence is nothing new in the city of 121,000 residents 35 miles east of
Los Angeles. Two people were killed and five injured in two days of gang
shootings in January, prompting the arrest of 36 people. Territorial wars among
Latino gangs in Pomona have been common for years.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sunday's triple homicide shattered a calm of many months and left
an air of unease among residents in the neat tract houses of south Pomona where
the victims had lived -- and died.
</P>
<P>
The elder Perez, who had just returned from a weekend trip to Mexicali to learn
his son was dead, was surrounded by friends and relatives Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Perez said, someone had fired a shot into his home. For
some time, he has been trying to sell his house to move back to Mexico with his
wife after 35 years in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors, many of whom had been awakened by the shootings, expressed
surprise that violence had reached their community. But others said they saw it
coming because the corner where the Perez house sits was becoming a youth
hangout.
</P>
<P>
"I know there are a lot of gangs in the area, but it's the first time it's come
down this little street," said a resident, who would only identify herself as
Kathy.
</P>
<P>
"They were the type you'd see and right off the bat know they were gangs," said
another neighbor, a county worker who asked not to be identified. "It was just
an invitation for someone to come by and start making trouble."
</P>
<P>
Perez was a student at Garey High School, his friends said, while Salazar
worked at a bottling plant in Lakewood. Additional information about Cruz was
not available.
</P>
<P>
"This shows gang violence plagues all communities," Pomona Police Lt. Larry
Todd said. "Nobody's immune. That's the sad part."
</P>
<P>
Four other people died in gang violence in the county late Saturday and early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
* Samuel White, 15, was killed when three to four men shot him and a
15-year-old girl as the victims stood on a street corner in South Los Angeles
about 9:40 p.m. Saturday, police said. The girl, Eve Thornton, was hospitalized
in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
* Jose Ortiz, 15, was killed and two others wounded when a gunman opened fire
at a wedding anniversary party in East Los Angeles at 11:10 p.m. Saturday,
sheriff's deputies said. Steven Gonzales, 14, and John Chavez, 31, were
hospitalized in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
* Albert Harris, 22, a suspected gang member, died about 4 a.m. Sunday after
two reputed members of a rival gang shot him in the head at a hamburger stand
at 254 E. Manchester Ave., Los Angeles police said.
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made in the three shootings.
</P>
<P>
* A 16-year-old female gang member was arrested in the stabbing death of
Roberto Mendieta, 18, after a robbery at 2:10 a.m. in the 1300 block of South
Kenmore Avenue. The suspect was held at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder
and robbery. Several other assailants, described only as young men, were at
large, Los Angeles police said.

   Solemn Memorial Day ceremonies honored the nation's war dead
Monday, drawing thousands to Washington's monuments and small-town
cemeteries, while many others partied in the sunshine to kick off
the summer season.
   ``It's about the saddest day _ that and Christmas,'' said
Margaret Meyers, 90, of Columbus, Ohio, who lost two sons at
Normandy in 1944.
   Memorial Day is ``a day of reflection, of being extremely
disappointed in the heart and mind ... and of thinking ... how much
I wish I could close the book on my father,'' said Robin Powers,
28, of Orion Township, Mich., outside Detroit. Her father, Maj.
Gary G. Wright, was declared missing in action after his Air Force
reconnaisance jet disappeared over Southeast Asia on Jan. 17, 1967.
   At Boston, a cannon on the bow of the 190-year-old USS
Constitution was fired 21 times beginning at noon.
   A wreath-laying ceremony was held at the Tomb of the Unknowns in
Arlington Cemetery just outside Washington, drawing about 4,000
people.
   U.S. Park Police estimated that 15,000 people gathered on the
Mall in Washington for a ceremony at the Vietnam Memorial.
   The Kennedy family spent a quiet Memorial Day at their
Hyannisport, Mass., compound following a small memorial service
Sunday for the 71st birthday of President John F. Kennedy, said
family spokesman Marc O'Connor.
   Illinois' new Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, dedicated less than a
month ago, attracted more weekend visitors than Lincoln's Tomb,
officials said. ``They're there from early morning until the
cemetery closes at 7 p.m.,'' said Nan Wynn, site manager for the
memorial, located in Springfield's Oak Ridge Cemetery less than a
quarter-mile from Lincoln's Tomb.
   Homeless veterans were among the 200 to 300 people marching in
the traditional New York County American Legion parade in
Manhattan. Larger parades were held elsewhere in the metropolitan
area.
   ``I marched in the parade because I felt I wasn't recognized by
the American people,'' said Wayne Fraley, 36, who provided air
support for soldiers in Vietnam and now lives in a homeless men's
shelter in Queens. ``In time of war we were called elite. How did
we ever land in the streets?''
   A five-month observation of the 125th anniversary of the Battle
of Gettysburg opened with a parade and a speech by retired Gen.
William C. Westmoreland, who said the nation-building process that
soldiers died for during the Civil War continues today.
   ``A nation is never fully formed,'' Westmoreland told an
audience of about 1,000 in a speech at Gettysburg National Cemetery
in southeastern Pennsylvania. About 1,500 children spread flowers
on the graves of the 3,722 Civil War soldiers buried here.
   Solemnity was followed by Dixieland jazz at Prospect Hill
Cemetery at Omaha, Neb., when a band and about half of a crowd of
200 followed up a Memorial Day observance with a graveside salute
to Anna Wilson, a bordello madam who left $1 million to charity
when she died in 1911.
   ``Saluting a prostitute is not the purpose of this thing,'' said
program organizer Larry McNichols. ``For one thing, she gave a lot
of money to this cemetery.''
   In Los Angeles, 20 protesters chose Memorial Day as the occasion
to demand a boycott of the movie ``Rambo III,'' denouncing the film
as overly violent and declaring it inflames passions against the
Soviet Union.
   In Indianapolis, people already were lining up Monday for
tickets for the 1989 running of the famous 500-mile race. The line
of those waiting to turn in their orders at the ticket windows
stretched 100-deep at times.
   Though most workers got the day off, Monday was not a paid
holiday for state employees in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
Alabama state employees worked as a trade-off for the holiday they
received April 25 for Confederate Memorial Day.
   Much of the nation had fair weather for Monday's ceremonies,
parades, picnics and beach parties, but parts of the West had
weather definitely not in keeping with the holiday's reputation as
the start of the summer season.
   Large sections of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming were
closed because of snow, which accumulated 4 to 6 inches deep in
park mountain passes by early afternoon, park officials said.
   Snow fell at higher elevations of Utah, with 5 inches at the
Alta ski resort, and light snow lingered in northeastern Nevada,
the National Weather Service said. On Sunday, a surprise storm
dumped up to 6 inches of snow in the mountains of northern
California, surprising thousands of travelers and campers.
   Stiff wind and pounding seas trapped scores of boaters in coves
on the Channel Islands off Southern California, and 19 people were
rescued after their boats were smashed in two spots on Santa
Catalina Island.
   But where the weather was good, people shook off the memories of
winter and headed for the outdoors.
   ``We've been very busy,'' said Elizabeth Rothenberger of the
Exeter Public Golf Course in Reading, Pa.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and 80s across Michigan and
tourists packed motels and a state park along Grand Traverse Bay on
the state's Lake Michigan side.
   ``Last year we never did fill up,'' Traverse City State Park
Manager Ivan Rockwell said. ``This year, we were full on Saturday
night.''
   AAA Michigan said staffers at Van Riper State Park near
Champion, just west of Marquette, reported the biggest crowd in 20
years.
   Beaches along most of Massachusetts' Cape Cod were less crowded
Monday after clouds moved in. ``It was crazy until today,'' said
Tanya Hirst at the Cape Cod National Seashore.
   Along the Missouri shore of the Mississippi River, St. Louis
Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., piloting the Becky Thatcher
Riverboat, edged St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary aboard the
Tom Sawyer in their annual Memorial Day Riverboat Race. The boats
are driven by modern propellers but carry paddle-wheels to look
like the old-time river steamers.
   ``We were long overdue,'' Schoemehl said. ``We had a new boat
and a new beginning.'' McNary leads in the seven-year series with a
4-2-1 record.

<TEXT>
   Publisher Morton Frank, chairman emeritus of the
Sunday newspaper supplement USA Weekend, died of complications
following heart surgery in Bridgeport, Conn., his son said Friday.
He was 77.
   Frank died late Thursday at Bridgeport Hospital, said his son,
Allan Dodds Frank, a correspondent with ABC News in New York.
   For 14 years, Frank was in charge of Family Weekly, now called
USA Weekend. During his tenure, circulation grew from about 3
million in fewer than 100 newspapers to more than 13 million in
more than 360 newspapers. Frank arranged the sale of the
publication in 1976; it is now owned by Gannett Co. Inc.
   Frank also was on the board of the American Journal of Nursing
Publishing and of Horizon Communications Inc., publishers of Vista,
a national newspaper supplement targeted at Hispanics.
   A native of Pitcairn, Pa., Frank earned gradyated from the
University of Michigan in 1933. He received a law degree from
Alfred University in 1979.
   Frank started his career as an advertising manager for the Daily
News Herald in Braddock, Pa., and a year later was named editor of
the Braddock Free Press. He next worked for the Pittsburgh Press
for six years, as an advertising salesman, entertainment writer and
manager of rotogravure.
   During World War II, Frank was an intelligence officer and
gunnery officer before becoming executive officer of the Navy's
Fleet Home Town News Service.
   In 1946, he worked for the Arizona Times before moving to
Canton, Ohio, with his first wife, Agnes Dodds. There they owned,
edited and published weekly newspapers including the Canton
Economist and the Stark County Times.
   Divorced in 1958, Frank married Elizabeth Pope, a magazine
editor, in 1963. The couple lived in New York and Easton, Conn.
   Frank is survived by his wife; his son Allan; another son,
Michael Robert Frank, an independent record producer in Chicago,
and a daughter, Marilyn Morton Frank, an actress in Chicago.

<HEAD>A Day On The Campaign Trail With 85-Year-Old Euterpe Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE ESPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Euterpe Dukakis is awake at 2:30 one
recent Friday morning, too excited for sleep. At age 85, she is
ready for another campaign trip on behalf of her son, Michael, who
is running for president.
   Her mostly elderly audiences marvel at the energy that propels
her through the once rich anthracite coal country of eastern
Pennsylvania.
   From Wilkes-Barre to Scranton to Olyphant to Allentown, Mrs.
Dukakis and four campaign workers drive past slack piles and fields
of morning glories. With only three hours sleep, she naps when she
can.
   Before the day is over, she will speak at four events, pose for
souvenir photos with well-wishers and give brief interviews to a
dozen reporters. She will work the crowds, clasping hands and often
speaking in her native tongue to Greek-Americans.
   She talks of her immigration to the United States from Larissa
in northern Greece with her parents and three sisters when she was
9 years old.
   ``We came to my older brother who came first when he was 18
years old and settled here. This is the story of all immigrant
families. Then he brought my younger brother and the two together
were able to bring the whole family,'' she says.
   ``I don't know where she gets the energy at that age to give one
speech and go on to another,'' says Jule Dobrowski, 70, who was
among 200 elderly residents who heard Mrs. Dukakis speak at the
Lackawanna County Health Care Center in Olyphant.
   ``I come from strong mountain people,'' Mrs. Dukakis said in an
interview en route from one stop to another. ``Maybe that's one
thing. My grandmother died at 95. My great-grandmother died when
she was 105. I have a long way to go yet ... This campaign has
really gave me a great infusion of energy.''
   She has traveled to two dozen states, some more than once, from
East Coast to West Coast, in the more than a year she has been
drumming up votes for her son, the Democratic presidential nominee.
She averages three days a week on the campaign trail.
   She looks like the Old World mother that she is, a plain woman,
short white-grayish hair, glasses, simple black skirt, peach
colored blouse, red jacket.
   As a matter of fact, only the Sunday before this trip, her son
went to her house, not for political advice, which she never gives
him, but for breakfast. She made blueberry muffins for him, which
he enjoyed, then filled a box for him to take home to his wife,
Kitty.
   ``She's a regular mother,'' says Mary Thomas, a Pennsylvania
delegate for Dukakis at the Democratic national convention last
July. ``She's a person you can relate to. She's a real person.''
   Matronly in dress and simple in speech, she is spunky in
defending her son against attacks from the Republicans including
his opponent, Vice President George Bush, and President Reagan.
   ``They're not true,'' she said. What particulary hurt her was
Reagan's reference last August to her son as an invalid in response
to Dukakis' denial that he had ever undergone psychiatric
treatment. The president said later he was joking.
   ``Michael had lost his brother in a terrible accident and he
also lost the election and he was depressed,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   Dukakis' older brother, Stelian, who was beset by mental
problems, died in 1973 when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver
while riding his bike. To this day the driver has not been caught.
Dukakis lost in his bid for a second term as governor in the 1978
primary election but won back the office four years later.
   Mrs. Dukakis is no different than most parents when it comes to
bragging about her son.
   ``Michael has been my joy from the time he was born,'' she told
200 people at the Wilkes-Barre Senior Citizens Center. ``He was a
very easy child to bring up. He loved life. He loved everything
that he did. He loved people and he has continued to and that is
why he is in politics.''
   Mrs. Dukakis says she loves campaigning and was disappointed
when she was grounded for a time in August because of laryngitis
and a bad cough. ``I love meeting people. My son gets it from me, I
guess.''
   She shows her enthusiasm after a luncheon of chicken and rice in
Scranton with local supporters. ``Too bad we couldn't push the
tables to the wall and start dancing,'' she tells them as she
hurries to the next stop. ``Another time.'' They laugh and applaud.
   But it is not all laughter. Even though Mrs. Dukakis says she's
never had one unhappy moment on the campaign trail, small groups of
anti-abortion demonstrators dog her wherever she goes with signs
saying things like, ``We welcome you more than your son will
welcome the unborn.'' Aides try to steer her out of sight of them.
   ``Michael is pro-life,'' she says. ``But he's not the same
pro-life that they are. It isn't that he's for abortion but since
it exists, let a woman make her own choice according to her
religion or her sense of morals.''
   At the end of this day, she has a 7 p.m. flight to catch at
Allentown airport. She wants to get home before 10. ``I want to see
Kitty on TV with Barbara Walters. This is an important night, sir.''
   But the flight is an hour late late because of thunderstorms.
She sits in the airport lounge watching her son on the television
news. Finally, she is airborne and arrives back home in Brookline,
Mass., just moments before 10.

   The 50th Black Hills Motor Classic, which
lured 300,000 bikers to this town of 7,000, had everything people
here had come to expect from a motorcycle rally: choppers, tattoos,
leather _ and violence.
   Eleven people died, one man was shot and two others were stabbed
in a bar brawl between motorcycle gangs, and hundreds were arrested
during the weeklong event.
   ``As I've said before, the potential is there,'' said Sheriff
Floyd Cleland. ``These people all drink booze, take drugs and carry
knives and guns.''
   Law officers shot to death a knife-wielding Australian who
charged them, and another person died of carbon monoxide poisoning
in a tent. The nine other deaths came in crashes.
   Marcy Myhre, executive director of the Sturgis Area Chamber of
Commerce's Black Hills Motor Classic Board, had predicted last fall
that this year's event could draw more than 250,000 people. Last
year's rally drew only 60,000, but officials estimated that at
least 300,000 showed up during the past week.
   ``I think that's kind of conservative,'' Myhre said of the
official estimate.
   Long lines of motorcycles roared out of town Sunday. Bill
Kienast of Oshkosh, Wis., said he was attending his first rally
here and would probably return despite the bloody bar brawl.
   ``With this amount of people, you know there's going to be
things happen. There's going to be accidents. There's going to be
fights,'' Kienast said.
   Myhre acknowledged that some Sturgis residents were bothered by
the huge crowds and violence. ``A lot of them feel it was a little
too much, but a lot of them realize this is a once-in-a-lifetime
crowd, too,'' she said.
   Law officers had made 202 drunken driving arrests and 73 drug
arrests by Sunday. There were 133 reported traffic collisions, 78
involving injuries. Officers issued 1,060 traffic tickets and 2,143
warnings.
   The bar brawl at Gunner's Lounge and Casino Saturday night
erupted between rival from the Outlaws and Sons of Silence
motorcycle gangs, he said.
   Aggravated assault charges will be filed against two Sons of
Silence gang members who were hospitalized in serious condition
with stab wounds, authorities said. An Outlaws gang member who was
shot in the neck was allowed to travel home to Atlanta on Sunday
and was not immediately charged.
   Sturgis residents Ken and Barb Grosch were on Main Street on
Saturday night with their video camera to record the procession of
bikes and bikers.
   ``It's nice to see a small, boring town come alive,'' said Mrs.
Grosch. ``I think it's great, but after a week or so I'm ready to
see them go home.''

Two reputed Santa Ana gang members, convicted of murdering a teen-age rival and
a 4-year-old bystander in the worst gang violence in county history, were
ordered Friday to spend the rest of their lives in prison for a crime the judge
called "inexcusable."
</P>
<P>
Tensions ran high in the tightly guarded courtroom of Superior Court Judge
Tulley H. Seymour as two dozen supporters of the defendants -- some wearing
"Not Guilty" T-shirts -- shot occasional glances at their outnumbered rivals
across the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
There, among the black-clad relatives of the two victims in the Sept. 16, 1989,
shooting in Garden Grove, sat several key witnesses who had broken a
longstanding "code of silence" among gangs and helped to prosecute Louis P.
Valadez, 28, and Robert P. Figueroa, 21.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after her son was sentenced, Isabel Figueroa of Santa Ana stormed out
of her seat and, as she tried to push her way past police at the door, struck
one officer in the shoulder. She was taken into custody for booking on a charge
of assaulting a peace officer, police said.
</P>
<P>
Court marshals and police were so worried about further confrontation that,
after the sentencings, they separated the family and friends of the defendants
from those of the victims and led them out of the building in shifts.
</P>
<P>
Even then, one group yelled at the other as they drove away from the Harbor
Courthouse on Jamboree Road.
</P>
<P>
Frank Fernandez Sr., whose 4-year-old son was killed in a hail of gunfire in
the attack, said outside the courtroom that hostilities among the rival
factions "is gonna get worse right now -- because everyone's mad. But hopefully
it'll blow away."
</P>
<P>
His son, Frank Jr., was shot to death as he sat with the family in their car on
La Bonita Avenue in Garden Grove, waiting to go to the movies. Police said
several young men in a pickup truck drove slowly past the area where they were
parked as another group of people stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
Men in the truck then opened fire with semiautomatic rifles, killing Frank Jr.
and17-year-old Miguel (Smokey) Navarro. A 17th Street gang member, Navarro may
have been a target of the drive-by shooting, which was spurred by an earlier
attack in 5th Street gang territory, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Six other people were wounded in the gunfire, including Frank Jr.'s 2-year-old
brother and a man whose left leg had to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Seymour sentenced a third man convicted in the attack to 25 years to
life in prison. The judge said Friday that he wanted to give Roman Gabriel
Menchaca, 20, an even tougher sentence but could not because the jury convicted
him only of conspiracy and split over a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
The fourth defendant in the case, a 15-year-old gang member, is to be sentenced
next Friday in juvenile court. He is expected to be sent away to the California
Youth Authority until he turns 25. Authorities allege that the minor and
Menchaca, in the back of the pickup, were the shooters.
</P>
<P>
The sentencing next week will close out a case that stirred fears of rising
gang warfare in Santa Ana, Garden Grove and elsewhere in the county because of
the brutality and disregard for bystanders.
</P>
<P>
In delivering the sentence, Seymour said he was sending a "message" to the
community as well as seeking to execute justice. "This is a real pivotal case
as far as this county is concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef echoed that theme, telling the judge that he
must send a signal to gang members that their crimes will be dealt with sternly
in the judicial system. "That's the way you educate the gang members," he said.
</P>
<P>
Neither Valadez nor Figueroa is alleged to have been a shooter in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Valadez, who had served time in state prison for assault and
was on parole at the time of the crime, was the "leader" and mastermind of the
assault and drove the truck.
</P>
<P>
Figueroa, they say, rode in the passenger seat and set the stage for the
killings the day before by warning rival gang members that he was going to pay
their friends "a visit."
</P>
<P>
In ordering the two defendants to each spend life in prison without the
possibility of parole, Seymour pointed to the multiple victims in the
shootings, their use of a minor and the "planning and sophistication" of the
attack, showing premeditation.

David A. Zimmerman, attorney for Valadez, delivered a virulent attack on the
credibility of the young women who had placed the defendants at the scene.
Calling their testimony "lies," he said: "(Valadez) goes to prison forever for
that! I don't think that's a fair trial."
</P>
<P>
Isabel Figueroa also attacked the justice system, saying the judge and the jury
were "prejudiced" against her son. "He never got a chance to prove that he was
innocent," she said in an emotional address to the court.
</P>
<P>
Seymour not only rejected their appeals for leniency but also ordered the
defendants to each pay $10,000 in restitution to the families of the victims.
Valadez sat stone-faced as the sentence was delivered, but Figueroa strained
through his handcuffs to wipe tears from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman showed his frustration with the sentence when Seymour asked him how
many days his client had already served in jail, to be credited against his
life sentence. Caustically, the defense attorney answered, "It's hard to
believe anything could be more academic, judge."

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A former minister charged in the
starvation death of his son did not buy food with the $3,700 he was
saving for God, but never gave the money to the church, either,
police and church leaders said.
   Larry and Leona Cottam were charged Thursday with murdering their
son, Eric, 14, who was found by police Wednesday in the Cottam's
modest Nuangola home, just outside Wilkes-Barre in northeastern
Pennsylvania. The 5-foot-10 teen-ager weighed 69 pounds.
   Police said they found no food in the house, but Cottam turned
over $2,131 in cash, two $50 savings bonds, a savings account book
showing a balance of $1,281 and a checkbook showing a balance of
$263.
   Cottam told police the family had not eaten since Nov. 22.
   ``Larry Cottam said he did not spend the money because it did not
belong to them,'' according to an affidavit by state Trooper James
J. Henry Jr. ``He stated that the money was `tithe' money and
belonged to God.''
   Cottam told police all four family members had discussed using
the tithe to buy food but decided against it, according to the
affidavit.
   Frank Kowalski, first elder at the Seventh-day Adventist church
near Nuangola, said Cottam had not paid a tithe to the church since
the family moved to Nuangola from the Pittsburgh area in 1985.
   Pastor Paul Jensen, who works at the church's state headquarters
in Reading, said tithes are standard for Seventh-Day Adventists, but
not at the expense of a believer's family.
   ``We don't believe in starving people,'' Jensen said. ``We don't
believe you should neglect your family for your tithe.''
   Seventh-day Adventists are fundamentally evangelical and take the
Bible as their sole rule of faith and practice.
   Cottam, 39, a former Seventh-day Adventist pastor was fired from
his job as a truck driver in March.
   The couple and their 12-year-old daughter, Laura, were listed in
serious condition Friday with varying degrees of malnutrition,
dehydration and vitamin deficiencies.
   In addition to the criminal homicide charges, the Cottams face
two counts each of recklessly endangering another person and two
counts each of endangering the welfare of children.
   They could get the death penalty if convicted on the homicide
charge.
   Officials from the Luzerne County Children and Youth Services
filed a petition Friday to take custody of Laura Cottam.
   Cottam was hired as pastor of four local Seventh-day Adventist
churches six years ago.
   He was transfered to Pittsburgh when he couldn't get along with
the congregation, Kowalski said. He lost the post in 1985 and his
pastor's license with the church, and the family moved back to
Nuangola.
   ``I think they took the Lord and tested him to the extreme,''
said Kowalski. ``You know, I know, everybody knows food don't fall
out of the sky.''

<TEXT>
   Bitter-cold Canadian air blanketed much of the nation Monday from
the Northeast and Midwest to the South, contributing to at least
three deaths as temperatures plunged to record lows in two dozen
cities.
   The early deep freeze _ more than a week before the official
onset of winter _ caused water pipes to burst, cars to die and
homeless people to seek warmth in shelters. It also produced
scattered power outages, record power demand and public-transit
delays.
   Greg McGarry, a spokesman for the Albany (N.Y.) Medical Center
Hospital, said he experienced the subzero air fully with his sons on
their morning paper route.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' McGarry said. ``They were dying.''
   Weekend snow and ice were blamed for a dozen traffic fatalities
in the nation's midsection. Snow was falling Monday over parts of
Minnesota and North Dakota. Snow was forecast for Wisconsin, a snow
advisory was in effect for eastern Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas,
and wintry weather was expected in the Carolinas.
   The cold weather was caused by arctic air that flowed across
Canada and into the north-central and northeast United States, said
Hugh Crowther, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's
Severe Storms Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``About 25 cities reported record low temperatures this
morning,'' he said Monday.
   Among them were Albany, N.Y., were thermometers dipped to 12
below zero; Allentown, Pa., 2 degrees; Asheville, N.C., 16 degrees;
Baltimore, 12 degrees; Boston, 2 degrees; Detroit, 2 below zero;
Elkins, W.Va., 10 below; Hartford, Conn., 3 below; Houghton Lake,
Mich., 12 below; Newark, N.J., 6 degrees; Philadelphia, 8 degrees;
and Wilmington, Del., 8 degrees. Washington, D.C., tied its record
for the date of 13 degrees.
   Saranac Lake, N.Y., near Lake Placid, had the coldest temperature
in the nation Monday morning, 28 below zero.
   ``It gets colder than this _ sometimes 30 below,'' said resident
Mary LaRose, who said schools were open but village streets were
quieter than usual.
   The bitter temperatures forced the homeless off the streets in
many cities, agencies reported.
   ``We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when the
weather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here show
up because they just can't bear the cold,'' said Edith Richardson,
assistant supervisor of the 113-bed Detroit Rescue Mission.
   In Philadelphia, city workers and police tried to round up
homeless people. In New York City, where the temperature dipped to a
record-low 5 degrees, police took only four homeless people to
shelters late Sunday and early Monday. Three came in voluntarily; a
cold weather alert gave police the authority to move the fourth
against her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   Two people in New York apparently didn't make it to a shelter. A
homeless man was found Sunday on a Brooklyn street, apparently
frozen to death, police said. His identity was not known. Also
Sunday, a woman was found dead in an underpass of a subway station,
and police said she may have died from a combination of a drug
overdose and the cold.
   In Baltimore, fire killed a woman in her 60s early Monday in a
house where heat and electricity had been turned off. The woman
apparently was using candles for heat and light, said Fire Capt. Pat
Flynn.
   Also Monday, Baltimore police responding to an anonymous call
found an infant wrapped in a trash bag outside a vacant house. The
boy, believed to be two days to a week old, was reported in good
condition at a hospital.
   ``He had not been there very long. He was warm to the touch,''
said a police spokeswoman, Agent Arlene Jenkins.
   Frozen switches slowed Philadelphia-area commuter trains, and
frozen signals delayed the PATH train system that links northern New
Jersey with Manhattan.
   In Delaware, Delmarva Power and Light Co. said high power demand
hampered its efforts to restore power to about 10,000 customers
after an equipment failure. The cold was a factor in scattered power
outages affecting at least 2,900 customers in Connecticut, Northeast
Utilities said.
   The New England Power Pool, an association of 96 electric
utilities, expected Monday's power useage to set a record. Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp. reported a record-high winter power demand across
New York state.
   In Boston, near-zero temperatures hampered crews trying to shut
down a broken water main that closed a section of a busy artery for
about three hours. Plows were called to clear about eight inches of
slush formed by the thousands of gallons of water.
   In Hartford, Conn., burst pipes forced firefighters to pump water
out of the first floor of the Legislative Office Building.
   In Rochester, N.Y., where the mercury plunged to 8 below, people
with car trouble were calling in record numbers to the Rochester
Auto Club, said club president Charles Gertner.
   More than a foot of snow caused hundreds of weekend traffic
accidents in Ohio, leading to four deaths, authorities said. Wind
whipped up to 2 inches of snow in Kansas, causing hazardous driving
conditions and several fatal accidents that left six dead. Two
highway fatalities in Pennsylvania on Sunday and Monday were blamed
on icy roads.

<TEXT>
   The city and a group of parents told a judge
today that retarded people living at home are likely to backslide in
their skills because the state cut off money for workshops, training
and other services.
   The plaintiffs asked a Commonwealth Court judge to restore $7.9
million cut June 30 from programs that benefit 7,750 retarded people
living at home.
   Unless the aid is restored, thousands of retarded people may be
forced into institutions against their families' wishes in order to
get help, the city has charged.
   The state of Pennsylvania contends it is meeting its obligation
under law to dole out its limited resources fairly.
   David Ferleger, a lawyer for the parents, said that if the
parents prevail, he will then argue that all retarded people living
at home _ not just the 7,550 Philadelphians involved in the lawsuit
today _ have a right to the such services at home.
   Leona Fialkowski, whose son David, 27, was dropped from the
program on July 14, and Audrey Coccia, whose daughter Gina, 22, was
similarly removed, testified their children have been regressing
because of a lack of services.
   ``We are starting to see regression in David in his efforts in
walking and self-help,'' Mrs. Fialkowski said. ``He needs attention
to maintain what he has. He cannot walk now the distance he could
walk before. He is being harmed because of the lack of training and
the lack of physical therapy.''
   Mrs. Coccia said her daughter had been learning how to work and
was taught living skills. ``And now most of the time she watches
television, follows her father and me around the house,'' she said.
   Ferleger said that if he succeeds in proving that all retarded
people at home are entitled to such programs, thousands more
retarded people across Pennsylvania will receive services at home at
an additional cost to the state of about $30 million, of which
one-third would go to Philadelphia.
   ``This could involve more than 100,000 persons with retardation
across the country,'' he said.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that
reducing such services does not violate a retarded person's rights
under the U.S. Constititution. The court sent the case back to the
state courts.
   Richard Gold, first deputy city solicitor, said budget
constraints since 1983 in retardation programs have forced the city
in the last two months to end or reduce ``minimum essential
services'' to retarded people living at home.
   ``We contend they have a right to continue to receive those
services under state law, and the state is obligated to pay 90
percent of those costs while the city picks up the rest of the
bill,'' Gold said. He said the city's allocation from the state is
$7.9 million short.
   But Assistant Attorney General Gwen Mosley, representing the
state, said Pennsylvania is doing all it is required to do. She said
the state budgeted about $105.3 million, of which Philadelphia's
share is approximately $20 million.
   ``Some people need residential services and they can't get it,
and some need at-home services and they can't get it,'' she said.
``There are waiting lists. The need outstrips the resources
available.''
   Ms. Mosley said the state is required by law to distribute its
money ``in a fair and reasonable manner.''
   ``This means that all the counties will get some but not all the
monies they need,'' she said.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A story Venezuelans tell on their
Colombian neighbors is coming true at home.
   A traveler tells a friend: ``I saw the Eiffel Tower, so I knew
we were in Paris. I saw the Pope and figured we were in Rome. One
day I reached for my wallet and it was gone. I knew I was in
Colombia.''
   These days, with the oil boom of the early 1980s long gone,
Venezuela is earning its own reputation for missing wallets, armed
robbery, stolen cars, business fraud and government corruption.
   Caracas was a small colonial city of unlocked doors 40 years
ago. Now it is a metropolis of apartment buildings surrounded by
walls of stone and steel, patrolled by armed guards and dogs.
   Nightlife has dwindled. Hardly anyone stops to help a stranger.
Squatter shacks sprout near mansions.
   There are no safe zones. One of the city's most hazardous areas
is Las Mercedes, known for fancy restaurants, expensive boutiques
and armed robbers.
   The mayor of Caracas outlawed liquor sales after midnight,
figuring less drinking would mean less crime, but the trend
continued upward.
   Last month, President Carlos Andres Perez sent a 600-member
National Guard unit into the streets.
   Crime ``has forced us to require the National Guard in new
roles, with greater importance, more members'' and a mandate to
work ``permanently in cities such as Caracas,'' he said.
   Venezuela had a decade-long oil boom, during which its people
felt immune to such problems. The rich times were followed by seven
years of economic decline that exposed the immunity as a myth.
   Half the nation is desperately poor, and nearly half the workers
earn less than $100 a month, but most of those who try to explain
the crime wave blame other things.
   Many mention a national desire to continue living high with
little effort, known as ``facilismo.''
   Andres Coba of the national neighborhood association FACUR said
in an interview at a fashionable outdoor cafe: ``We had so much
money the whole world aspired to it. We sat at tables like these in
our New York clothes, and talked about France and Madrid.''
   Police chief Gonzalo Elias Bajares Colmenares, who has 7,000 men
in a city of about 4.5 million, took a similar view.
   ``People aren't stealing eggs or ham or bread or meat,'' he
said, but generally ``trying to get money to pay for luxury
items.''
   Authorities blame youths under 18 for 75 percent of street
crime, but many run free because of lenient punishment for
juveniles and become pawns of adult gangs. Overcrowded jails and
political judges clog the criminal justice system.
   Here are some recent cases:
   -A youth gang attacked a 15-year-old handicapped boy and stole
his wheelchair.
   -Just before breakfast, a lone armed robber raided the residence
of the Argentine ambassador, on embassy row half a block from a
police station. He got away with $10,000 worth of loot, including
the cook's paycheck, leaving the ambassador and his wife bound and
gagged.
   -Thieves broke into the home of Jules Waldman, a 77-year-old
American who founded the city's English-language newspaper.
Waldman, in delicate health, was hospitalized and died of a stroke
a month later.
   -On two occasions, gangs followed Germans on package tours to
the same resort, held up the hotel staff and made off with
passports, cameras and the contents of the hotel safe.
   -Thieves who tried to steal his car shot the son of a former
government minister to death in a wealthy neighborhood last New
Year's Eve.
   Sometimes, police are the criminals. Thirteen Caracas officers
were suspended in July, accused of burglarizing downtown shops.
Chief Bajares fired 107 policemen in a year's time, some of whom
were charged with robbery, theft or murder.
   Low pay - $185 a month for a Caracas street cop - is cited as
one factor turning policemen to crime, but the problem goes deeper.
Many come from the same violent, deprived backgrounds as criminals,
64 percent did not finish high school and 40 percent live in slums.
   The national attorney general's office is said to have
investigated more than 1,500 cases against police this year. The
new governor of western Carabobo state said the state police force
was riddled with criminals and fred 350 officers.
   White collar crime is estimated to have cost billions of dollars
in the 1980s, but no one has been sent to jail under an
anti-corruption law passed in 1983.
   Crime threatens to suffocate the infant tourist industry.
According to a Tourism Ministry survey, more than 70 percent of
tourists said they would not return.
   ``As long as Venezuela is such a den of thieves and corrupt
peacekeepers, the country will not be able to attract tourists in
significant numbers or persuade those who do come to return,'' a
British tourist wrote to to a Caracas newspaper.
   He said a mugger tried to steal his camera at high noon in
downtown Caracas.
   An Austrian tour agent wrote, ``In no other South American
country have I felt so cheated'' by overcharging, bad service and
fake promotional claims.

GANG MEMBER'S MOTHER DENIES 'FAILURE' CHARGE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South Los Angeles woman pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that she failed
her duties as a mother by allowing her 15-year-old son to participate in a
street gang, in the first case of its kind under a new parental responsibility
law.
</P>
<P>
Outside the crowded Municipal Court room, Gloria Williams, 37, refused to
answer questions about the charges alleging that she "failed to exercise
reasonable care, supervision, protection and control" of her teen-age son. The
youth is in custody on charges that he participated in the gang-rape of a
12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have something to say when this is all over," murmured Williams, a
frail-looking woman.
</P>
<P>
The mother of three was arrested last month at her home on West Boulevard after
police, investigating her son's alleged involvement in the rape, discovered
graffiti covering the boy's bedroom walls. Officers also seized two photograph
albums that they said contain pictures of Williams and her children posing with
Crips making gang hand signs and brandishing weapons.
</P>
<P>
When asked how she felt about her arrest, Williams, who faces up to a year in
prison and a $2,500 fine, rolled her eyes at reporters and said, "How do you
think I felt? I was mad."
</P>
<P>
Her 20-year-old daughter, Tiffany Grasham, declared, "I am very disgusted about
this whole thing. Other gang members have been arrested. Why hasn't anything
been done to their parents?"
</P>
<P>
Grasham, who is featured in many of the seized photographs wearing Crips colors
and making hand signs, added, "Those photographs were taken a long time ago,
and all they show is a bunch of people dancing and having fun."
</P>
<P>
Grasham said the weapons in the photographs were air guns. About the hand
signs, she said, "People pose when they take pictures, and that's all we were
doing."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrest Criticized
</P>
<P>
Daye Shinn, Williams' attorney, said, "The only reason (police) arrested my
client is because she's black and she's in a certain low-income bracket. . . .
Because law enforcement has not been able to solve the gang problem . . . they
are shifting the blame onto the parents."
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," Deputy City Atty. Debra Gonzales said later. "We are not
saying there aren't other parents out there who are in violation of (the
parental responsibility law), but she just happens to be the first person we
have actually charged."
</P>
<P>
The state law was passed last September as part of the Street Terrorism
Enforcement and Prevention Act, drafted by City Atty. James K. Hahn and Dist.
Atty. Ira Reiner to treat street gang activity as a form of organized crime.
Under the parental responsibility provisions of the law, parents can be
punished if they knowingly fail to control or supervise their children.
</P>
<P>
Shinn, one of the defense attorneys in the 1970 Charles Manson murder trial,
said he is confident that investigations will show Williams is not guilty of
any negligence.
</P>
<P>
Williams "is a hard-working, single mother who works eight or nine hours a day
trying to raise her kids," Shinn said. "What do they want her to do? Quit her
job and go on welfare to take care of her children or put her in jail and leave
the kids roaming the streets at home?"
</P>
<P>
Since Williams' arrest, officials at the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California said dozens of parents who live in gang-infested
neighborhoods have called them, afraid that they too could be arrested if their
children get into trouble. Executive Director Ramona Ripston said the ACLU
plans to file a lawsuit within the next month challenging the constitutionality
of the parental responsibility law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Women
</P>
<P>
"Many of the callers have been working mothers who get home at 5 p.m. when
their children get home at 3," Ripston said. "Are the parents supposed to be
punished if their kids get in trouble during those couple of hours? Each time a
child commits a crime, are the parents going to be examined?"
</P>
<P>
Maybe the parents should be looked at, said Rose Crannon of Concerned Parents
of South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Crannon, whose grass-roots group provides emotional support for parents of gang
members, said it is not uncommon for mothers and fathers to condone their
children's criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
"There are many parents who . . . accept drug money and stolen property even
though they know their kids are getting it illegally," she said. "They will
look the other way because they have never had a new car or color television
set."
</P>
<P>
A trial date for Williams was set for June 22.

<HEAD>Wright a Major Non-Subject During Lawmakers' Back-Home Meetings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ethics case against House Speaker Jim
Wright dominates Capitol Hill conversation, but lawmakers found out
over the weekend that folks back home have other things on their
minds.
   Wright's chief accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., used town
meetings in his suburban Atlanta district to cite repeatedly from
the House ethics committee report charging Wright with 69
violations.
   That was fine, said Bob Norton, a Douglas county real estate
broker. But he was more concerned over sewage and other pollution
in the Chattahoochee River.
   ``I'd be more enthusiastic about Newt if he'd get as much impact
on the environment and our rivers as he did on Jim Wright,'' he
said.
   Politicians found reactions like that were commonplace last
weekend in their first trips home since the ethics committee
announced it had reason to believe Wright had violated House rules.
   The panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, issued its equivalent of an indictment of Wright.
It will decide later whether to report actual violations to the
full House for disciplinary action.
   The charges center on allegations that Wright used a sweetheart
publishing deal and bulk book sales to evade House limits on
outside income, and that he accepted gifts from a friend who had an
interest in legislation.
   The committee is continuing to investigate an oil well deal that
netted a big profit for the speaker even though the well was a dud.
   And as a grassroots political topic, many lawmakers are finding
the Wright case is a dud, too.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said only newspaper reporters
asked her about Wright during her district visit. The freshman
congresswoman handled questions from voters on topics including
trade, fishing and forestry.
   Apparently her tastes mirror her constituents' _ she said she
repeatedly fell asleep when she tried to read the ethics panel
volume.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who has made several television
appearances on the Wright case to take on the speaker's accuser,
received only a single question on the topic at a Wellesley College
forum _ and that was from a professor.
   Paul Barstow, a professor of theater studies, said he was
concerned the Wright case would lead to a ``general perception of
corruption'' among the Democrats.
   Political science major Elizabeth Rosenkrantz, a senior who
helped organize Frank's appearance at the school, said the Wright
case was less important to her than issues such as abortion and the
federal budget.
   ``It doesn't affect me personally,'' she said.
   In Fort Worth, Wright's home district, people probably do take
his performance more personally. There, 79 percent gave him a job
rating of good to outstanding, according to a poll conducted by the
Fort Worth Star Telegram in the days following the ethics committee
report.
   Nationwide polls released today showed Wright to be far from a
front-burner issue.
   A Los Angeles Times poll found more than half the people
responding were ignorant of the charges. A Washington Post poll
found that only a third said they were closely following news about
Wright, and less than 40 percent knew his party.
   However, the same polls showed a strong majority _ 77 percent in
the Post survey _ believed he should resign if the charges against
him are found to be true.
   ``My reaction is to wait on any direct verdict until all the
evidence is in,'' said Kenneth Lakian, a Massachusetts College of
Law student who heard a speech there by Frank. ``I would hope the
public would give Jim Wright his day in court.''
   ``He's guilty as hell'' was the early line from Galen
Rottinghaus, a farmer in Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery's Kansas
district.
   But a Washington Post reporter who spent two days with Slattery
found that the congressman only received a Wright question at about
every other meeting.
   Slattery says when the issue comes before the full House, he
wants to judge Wright on the facts and not on public opinion. But,
he acknowledged, ``if the speaker loses the battle of public
opinion ... that will significantly weaken his political position
back home.''

   Christmas Eve fires killed at least 46 people in seven states
Sunday, including 12 people at a Tennessee retirement home, six
people at a family reunion in Atlanta, and a mother and four
daughters in a Dallas suburb.
   Five other fires had tragic consequences in Pennsylvania, New
York, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.
   Four members of a Pittsburgh family died and eight others,
including a pregnant woman, were injured. In Little Falls, N.Y., a
man tried in vain to save his wife and three children from a fire
that destroyed their trailer home.
   A mother and her two sons died in an early-morning blaze that
gutted their West Conshohocken, Pa., rowhouse; four people died in
an early morning bungalow fire in Swan Lake, N.Y.; and three
children died and their mother was seriously injured in an
apartment fire in Manchester, N.H.
   A 6-year-old boy died of smoke inhalation in Milwaukee when a
fire broke out in a bedroom in his apartment, and a 45-year-old
schoolteacher died when the torch he was using to thaw water in a
pipe apparently started a fire that destroyed a shed behind house
trailers he owned in Ashland, Wis.
   In Johnson City, Tenn., fire broke out at the 10-story John
Sevier Retirement Center around 5:30 p.m. and firefighters were
still battling it nearly six hours later, officials said.
Authorities said at least 14 people died and more deaths were
expected.
   At least 26 people were injured. About 145 people lived at the
center.
   The Atlanta fire gutted a one-story wood frame home, leaving
relatives who gathered for the reunion stricken, grieving and
homeless.
   ``We were all there for a family Christmas. Now, five of my
relatives are dead, and the others lost everything,'' said family
member Juanita McColumn. ``They ran out with just their night
clothes on, and they have no clothes and nowhere to stay.''
   Ms. McColumn identified the dead as LaVerne Willis, 30, her
sister; Latoya Willis, 6, Ms. Willis' daughter; Xavier Wilson, 4, a
nephew; Ernestine Strozier, 28 and her son, David, 8, both cousins
of the Willises; and Leroy Bain, 37, LaVerne Willis' boyfriend. All
lived in Atlanta.
   The fire lasted about two hours, said Sgt. C.A. Graham of the
Fulton County medical examiner's office. The cause was not known,
Graham said.
   In the Dallas suburb of Garland, a 31-year-old mother and four
daughters, ages 2 to 9, died when a fire that apparently began
around a Christmas tree engulfed their home.
   The woman's husband and two sons escaped the fire, officials
said.
   ``The firefighters were unable to get into the house to locate
anyone, the fire was so intense,'' said Ron Smith of the Garland
Fire Department.
   In Pittsburgh, fire tore through a home at 5:45 a.m., killing
Clarence Blakemore, 60, his 26-year-old daughter, and two
grandchildren, ages 2 and 4.
   Eight other Blakemore relatives were injured. Two were in
critical condition and three were in serious condition, including a
23-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant.
   The fire in Little Falls consumed Robert E. Thomas' trailer home
in a matter of minutes, state police said. Thomas struggled to save
his family through a rear door, but his 27-year-old wife and their
three sons, ages 2 to 6, died.
   ``He thought he kept hearing (son) Robby's voice calling `Daddy'
through the door. He kept yelling `Help me, help me get my babies
out!''' next-door neighbor Theresa Gressler said.
   In Swan Lake, four people died when a propane heater apparently
exploded around 3:30 a.m., destroying their bungalow, state Trooper
Mark Brown said. The four, all Brazilians, could not be identified
immediately, Brown said.
   Another Sunday morning fire in a single-family home in the
Albany, N.Y., suburb of Watervliet claimed one man's life, police
said.
   Fire officials in West Conshohocken, Pa., believe Sevilla Smith,
27, died while trying to save her two children, aged 15 months and
5 years, from a fire in their three-story home shortly after 3:30
a.m.
   In Manchester, N.H., two boys and a girl, ages 2 to 5, were
killed in their apartment in a three-story wood building, said
police Lt. James Stewart. Their mother, Jessica Lunderville, 30,
was hospitalized in critical condition Sunday night. Stewart said
the father and two other children were not home at the time.
   Also in Manchester, firefighters Sunday afternoon rescued 26
elderly nuns from a fire at a convent nursing home. The fire was
caused by an electrical malfunction at the Nativity scene in the
convent's chapel, said Manchester Police Chief Francis Monnelly.
Two nuns suffered smoke inhalation and were hospitalized in
satisfactory condition.

<HL> Back-Yard Spas;
Home Pools
Grow Lavish

   When Kathleen Campbell steps out on her patio in the summer heat, she surveys a scene that would make many sweltering city dwellers envious.

   Stone steps, lined with lush evergreens, descend to a blue ceramic-tiled jacuzzi frothing with white water.
Seven water jets spurt from the jacuzzi's base and cascade into a 32-by-16-foot swimming pool.
A cabana is being built nearby to provide a changing room for guests.

   Mrs. Campbell's new back-yard oasis in the suburbs of Bucks County, Pa., cost $75,000 -- hardly extravagant by today's standards as elaborate pools become hot sellers.

   Builders and sales representatives are reporting a boom in demand this summer for pools with such fancy extras as landscaping, waterfalls, fountains, gazebos, whirlpools, colored underwater lights and computerized control systems.
"The public is looking more to the back yard for entertainment," says Frank Geremia, president of Sacramento, Calif.-based Geremia Pools.
"The swimming pool has changed from a rectangular hole in the ground to an outdoor entertainment center."

   The National Spa and Pool Institute, a trade association based in Alexandria, Va., says sales of in-ground pools, almost all of which are residential, rose 8% last year to a record 120,000.
This year, the group projects an increase of as much as 15%.

   In some regions, such as the mid-Atlantic states, pool construction this year already has exceeded the 1986 total by a third.
Pool builders in these areas say they are thankful for the recent influx of idled construction workers from Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, where pool jobs have dried up with the oil-industry slump.

   Lower interest rates and wider availability of home-equity loans have helped fuel the lavish-pool trend.
Many families remortgage their homes to finance the fancy pools, which generally cost $50,000 to $100,000.
Interest on a mortgage loan on primary residences as well as on second homes can still be deducted from taxes.

   For many of the pool owners, gaining more control over leisure time is a prime motivation.
Many decide that designing their own little resort in the back yard is more convenient -- and less expensive -- than having a cabin in the mountains or a condominium on the beach.

   Linda Iacono, whose husband is a real-estate investor in Newtown, Pa., says her family's pool and hot tub were purchased in lieu of buying a summer home.
"We looked at houses on the (New Jersey) shore, but there's nothing down there for less than $300,000," she says.
"We had to find a summer swimming alternative, and we got our money's worth."

   In Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Michael and Marilyn Hartz spend weekends at home at their pool.
"We order big buckets of fried chicken or pizza, and people come in shorts or khakis," says Mrs. Hartz.
"It's sort of like a resort at home."

   Pool owners aren't reluctant to indulge themselves in fancy designs and special features.
KDI Sylvan Pools of Doylestown, Pa., built a pool shaped like a tulip for a tulip grower.
For a race-track owner, Robertson Bros.
Service Co. of Farmington Hills, Mich., built one in the shape of a horse's head.
In California, Geremia built one shaped like a foot for a podiatrist.

   Many homeowners tailor new pools to their homes and back yards, using extensive landscaping.
"We nestle the pool in the backyard so it looks like a natural part of the topography," says John Grissom, a landscaper in Farmington Hills.
He says his clients generally pay from $50,000 to $100,000 for trees, grass, flowers, boulders and cliffs to surround the pools.

   Ann Yarnall of New Hope, Pa., says her landscaped pool looks so invitingly woodsy that migrating geese stop in to visit.
Marybeth Martino, a pool owner in Newtown Square, Pa., is adding a fountain with water lilies and goldfish.

   The most requested extra feature is a spa or jacuzzi with jets for heated water, which costs about $4,700.
Sylvan says 60% of its customers buy pools with attached spas.
Automatic cleaning systems, chlorinators, and electronic temperature controls also are popular.
"People who buy home computers to do their banking also want all the latest gadgets when they buy a swimming pool," says Mr. Geremia.

   Mrs. Campbell agrees.
She decided not to skimp on the automated goodies when she purchased the family pool.
For example, a control switch in her kitchen operates the cleaning system.
It also changes the water temperature and turns on underwater lights.
While such automation can be costly, she says, "it's important because you want to spend your summer swimming, not cleaning the pool."
