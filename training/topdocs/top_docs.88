BUSH TAKES TRADE PLANS TO LATIN NATIONS

President Bush embarked Sunday night on a weeklong visit to South America,
seeking to promote the economic restructuring now under way throughout the
continent by building support for his free-trade proposals.
</P>
<P>
Aides to the President, who was scheduled to arrive here early today, said he
was not bringing much in the way of new proposals but that he will focus on the
trade-building aspects of his Enterprise for the Americas initiative and on the
strengthening of democracy, lately on the rise in the part of the world long
plagued by military dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
Besides Brazil, he will visit Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative, unveiled last June as a plan for
a "new economic partnership" with Latin America, would create a hemisphere-wide
free-trade zone stretching from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego at the southern
tip of Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
It includes a relatively modest $100-million-a-year U.S. grant in response to
"market-oriented investment reforms" intended to boost private enterprise in
Latin American economies.
</P>
<P>
The presidential visit to Brazil, the first by an American president in eight
years, comes at a time of a sharp turnaround in South America's political and
economic environment.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Cuba and Haiti, U.S. officials have pointed out --
overlooking several quasi-democratic regimes -- each of the governments in the
hemisphere holds office as the result of free elections. And on the economic
front, fiercely protective trading practices are giving way to a concerted
effort to open up borders with the hope of increasing markets.
</P>
<P>
By 1994, for example, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay hope to have
created a common market patterned after the economic and trade association of
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States in the past several months has signed bilateral
trade agreements with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The warmer trend in the U.S. relations with its southern neighbors was noted by
President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, who took office last March.
</P>
<P>
Writing in Gazeta Mercantil, a national financial newspaper, the 40-year-old
Brazilian leader said: "Over the last few months . . . Brazilian-United States
relations have no longer been marked by the contentious trade issues that had
achieved such notoriety in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil has completed its process of political transition to democracy. We are
moving toward the consolidation of a solid and modern market economy, capable
of ensuring that Brazilians are rescued from the extreme poverty in which a
majority still live," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
As much as U.S. officials are seeking to promote moves toward democracy,
Brazilian and other officials are taking every opportunity to call attention to
the fact that the rightist military regimes of the past have been turned out,
leftists are no longer threatening takeovers and trade, rather than direct aid,
is what is needed to pull the continent's nearly 400 million citizens out of
the dire poverty in which so many of them live.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy of anti-communism and 'assistancialism' (giving of assistance) is
no longer a suitable approach to Latin America," Brazilian Foreign Minister
Jose Francisco Rezek said.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of this hemisphere recognize that in the global economy in which
we live and operate, what is crucial to regimes is a chance to attract foreign
investment, to expand trade, reduce trading barriers, gain access to technology
and to international financial institutions, (and) reduce debt burdens," a
senior Bush Administration official said, speaking with reporters in Washington
on Friday.

  [Text] Caracas, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government
today reiterated its rejection of any unilateral or multilateral
armed intervention by any country in Haiti.
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said that
Venezuela will not be a party--under any circumstances--to any
armed action in Haiti to oust the military regime. Burelli
reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to cooperate in solving the
Haitian crisis, mentioning both nations' historical ties.
  The Haitian crisis was one of the subjects discussed during
the foreign ministers' meeting held on Monday, taking advantage
of the OAS meeting in Belem de Para (Brazil).
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said that Venezuela is one
of
the nations that has made great efforts seeking a solution to
the Haitian problem and for the restoration of ousted
Constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Venezuela, the
United States, France, and Canada are part of the so-called
"Group of Friends" that have sought alternatives for the
political crisis Haiti has experienced since Aristide left power.
  Burelli also indicated that Venezuela will only accept a
small group of Haitian refugees, after the Venezuelan Embassy in
the United States has certified their qualifications to be
received by the nation. The Venezuelan foreign minister
indicated that it was necessary "to definitely clear up
speculation," which has arisen on Venezuela's decision to accept
Haitian refugees.
  Burelli referred to the letter sent by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher in which he requests Venezuela's
cooperation to receive Haitian refugees. Nevertheless, the
Venezuelan reply to Christopher sums up that "under current
circumstances it has a flow of uninvited immigrants," who have
made even more difficult the conditions "increasing poverty and
aggravating the social order problem," Burelli indicated. "We
would accept a group qualified and certified by our embassy in
Washington," he added.
  Burelli also denied some statements published by several
local papers indicating Venezuela was ready to receive several
hundreds of Haitian refugees. He admitted, however, that if
Haitian refugees do arrive, their stay permanence will "only be
temporary," dependent on the solution of problems in Haiti.
  The minister finally ruled out the possibility of Venezuela
becoming a Haitian refugee camp.

  [Text] Caracas, 3 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Burelli said here today that Venezuela has agreed
to receive Haitian refugees on the condition that they comprise
only a small number of refugees who would remain in Venezuela
temporarily, until the crisis in the Antillean nation is
resolved.
  The Venezuelan Government's decision was announced after an
official U.S. delegation headed by Under Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott asked the government of Venezuelan President
Rafael Caldera to accept Haitian refugees.
  The U.S. official called the Venezuelan offer "generous,"
and
he recalled that Caracas had received the very first Haitian
refugee--President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was received by
Venezuela after he was overthrown in September 1991. Talbott
reiterated that his government wants a "peaceful and
multilateral" solution to the Haitian crisis.
  Burelli told newsmen that Venezuela "has informed the United
States that it will not close its doors and that it will receive
a group (of Haitians), provided they are temporary refugees who
will remain until the precarious situation in Haiti is resolved."
  The foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan Embassy
in
Washington will list the number of Haitians eligible to travel
to Venezuela as an "undetermined number," although "this cannot
be a large number."

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuela will not accept
impositions from the United States regarding Haitian refugees,
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas stated in remarks
reported today. The foreign minister stressed that reports that
the U.S. Government is forcing Venezuela to accept Haitian
refugees are false.
  "Venezuela is a sovereign country and does not accept
impositions from anybody," Burelli Rivas noted, although he
admitted his government may accept some Haitians for a brief
period. He added that the Rafael Caldera government shares the
concern regarding Haiti but added Venezuela has a foreign
immigrants problem, and for that reason cannot accept any more.
  Burelli Rivas added, however, that since Haiti is involved
and that Venezuela is committed to searching for solutions so
that democracy can return to that country, some Haitians may be
allowed in for a brief period. "That was the response I gave to
the U.S. Department of State," he indicated.
  The top official said no Haitians have come to the
Venezuelan
Embassy in Port-au-Prince and added that the United States has
two ships off the Jamaican coast to pick up Haitians and that
only six out of 35 who requested asylum were accepted.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Burelli, who is a candidate for the post of general
secretary of the OAS, said today in Brasilia that the OAS, which
comprises 35 nations of the continent, could become a great
organization.
  "An inferiority complex has been created regarding the OAS,
and it is necessary to overcome it," Burelli said. He
challenged the other candidates, Colombian President Cesar
Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, to a
television debate -- possibly over the U.S. CNN Channel.
  Regarding the acceptance of his initiative, the Venezuelan
foreign minister told EFE that "the ball is in their court."
  Burelli is participating in Brasilia in a 48-hour meeting of
the foreign ministers and government delegates of the 13
countries of the Rio Group, the main mechanism for political and
economic agreement within Latin America.
  The ambassadors of OAS member countries will elect a
successor of the Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares, who has
occupied the post of OAS secretary general for two consecutive
5-year periods since 1984.
  Referring to Gaviria, Burelli said that never -- during the
history of the organization -- has the United States ever
proposed a candidate on its own initiative.
  Gaviria's candidacy is supported by several Rio Group
countries including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and
Argentina.
  Burelli highlighted the OAS system of organization, which
has
a developed administrative apparatus and a democratic hue
because each nation, no matter how large or small, has one vote.
  The Venezuelan foreign minister -- who was Venezuelan
ambassador to Washington, London, and Bogota -- added that he
will not campaign during the Rio Group meeting. He said: "I
have come to the meeting and that is all."
  Burelli said that "there are new factors" to evaluate
regarding the Cuban situation. "The Cuban people have suffered
a lot. There cannot be the same confrontation of ideas now as
in bygone days."
  Baena Soares said he believes it is necessary to consider
the
reintegration of Cuba into the OAS because "the 1990's are not
the 1960's."
  Burelli complained to EFE about the interpretation by the
international media of the Venezuelan situation following the
December 1993 elections in which Rafael Caldera became president.
  "The international press is not convinced that ethical
standards are being changed" in Venezuela, he explained.
  Burelli said President Caldera is willing to "completely
reorganize the family" of his country, by offering pardons to
all military officers who rose up in arms against the government
of then President Carlos Andres Perez.
  He added that those who found refuge in Peru are now
returning, adding that five officers being held the San Carlos
Garrison in Caracas will be released "at any moment."

  [Text] Brasilia, 18 Feb (EFE) -- The Brazilian Foreign
Ministry has denied an alleged Venezuelan military foray inside
Brazilian territory in the Amazon region.
  Brazilian Foreign Ministry sources in Brasilia said the
information regarding an incursion by Venezuelan National Guard
troops to capture Brazilian "garimpeiros" (illegal miners) is
"absurd."
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has not been informed about
the possible detention of "garimpeiros" by Venezuelan
authorities, even though the possibility cannot be ruled out,
the sources added.
  Entrepreneur Jose Altino Machado, who owns machinery for the
illegal mining of minerals in the Amazon region, said that last
week the Venezuelan National Guard entered Brazilian territory
to capture 32 "garimpeiros" and the "garimpeiros" were later
taken to the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ayacucho.
  In the past few years dozens of Brazilian "garimpeiros" have
been arrested by the National Guard on charges of illegal mining
of gold and other minerals in Venezuela. On some occasions
authorities were able to confirm reports of Venezuelan forays
inside Brazilian territory.
  Brazil and Venezuela share a common border 2,000 km long
that
is sparsely controlled, has minimal communications, and few
settlements.
  According to officials sources, the problem of illegal
mining, the protection of indigenous populations, and the Amazon
region's development will be discussed during an official visit
Brazilian President Itamar Franco will make to Venezuela between
3 and 5 March.
  Franco will travel to Venezuela at the invitation of
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera.

  [Text] Brasilia, 20 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign ministers and
government delegates of the 13 Rio Group countries on 21 March
will open in Brasilia a 48-hour meeting that will serve to sound
out their preferences in the election of the next OAS secretary
general.
  The meeting will be held on the eve of the 27 March vote in
Washington, at which the continent's 35 foreign ministers will
choose the replacement for Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares
as OAS secretary general.
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli -- who is
one of the three candidates for the post -- will attend the
three work sessions of the ministerial meeting, which will be
held on 21 and 22 March at Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign
Ministry headquarters.
  The other candidates are Colombian President Cesar Gaviria
and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Berns Niehaus.
  Even though it is not on the meeting's agenda, the OAS
secretary general's election will be discussed in the corridors
and even during formal sessions, which are flexible and during
which any delegate can raise an issue, diplomatic sources told
EFE.
  Brazil, the country that hosts the meeting in its capacity
as
holder of the annually rotating secretariat of the most
important Latin American political forum, supports Gaviria and
is confident he will win, a high-ranking Itamaraty official told
EFE.
  Gaviria should win, despite the fact that "the situation has
not yet reached a definitive status," he said.
  The majority of Rio Group countries that referred to the
matter -- Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico
-- support Gaviria.
  The Costa Rican candidate has assured that he has the
support
of the Caribbean and Central American bloc, while the Venezuelan
candidate has called on his two opponents to hold a television
debate to be aired to the entire continent for the purpose of
outlining their positions toward the OAS.
  The winner of the 27 March vote will be installed during the
OAS general assembly to be held from 5-10 June in the Amazon
city of Belem do Para (northern Brazil), the hometown of Baena
Soares, a former Brazilian deputy foreign minister who has held
the OAS secretariat for two consecutive five-year periods since
1984.
  The Rio Group ministers and government delegates will
address
various international issues dealing with commerce, disarmament,
UN bylaws' reform, the environment, the antinarcotics fight,
democracy, human rights, and initiatives to end the military
regime in Haiti.
  They also will exchange views and seek a consensus on the
position of Latin American governments on a continental summit
called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami.
  The ministerial meeting will coincide with the official
visit
of 5.5 hours that U.S. Vice President Alberto Gore will pay to
Brasilia on 21 March with the objective of promoting the
continental summit with Brazilian President Itamar Franco.
  Gore today began in La Paz a short tour of Latin America
that
will include stopovers in Buenos Aires and Brasilia.
  Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister Ralph Maraja
and Jorge Gordillo, one of Peru's deputy foreign ministers,
already have arrived in Brasilia to attend the Rio Group meeting.
  Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim (Brazil), Antonio Aranibar
(Bolivia), Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), Luis Ramirez
Boettner (Paraguay), Manuel Tello (Mexico), Gladys de Vielman
(Guatemala), Carlos Figueroa (Chile), and Sergio Abreu (Uruguay)
have confirmed that they will attend.
  Other delegations scheduled to arrive today or on 21 March
will be headed by Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando
Petrella and Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia,
while Ecuador will be represented by its ambassador in Brasilia,
Cesar Valdivieso.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli told EFE today in Brasilia that
the eradication of poverty must be "the number one issue" at the
continental summit called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for
December in Miami (United States).
  The Venezuelan minister said he believes Clinton's
initiative
is of "supreme interest" as a way to develop new relations
between the United States and Latin America following the end of
the Cold War.
  Burelli said: "We hope the schedule" for the Miami summit
"will be established soon." Burelli will participate in a
48-hour meeting of foreign ministers and governmental
representatives from 13 Rio Group countries that begins today at
Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry headquarters.
  This summit will allow an exchange of opinions toward
consensus among Latin American governments before the summit
called by President Clinton, and to review the international
situation.
  The ministers will establish the bases for two upcoming Rio
Group summits: the talks that are held twice a year with the EC
foreign ministers -- scheduled for 20-23 April in Sao Paulo --
and the Eighth Annual Rio Group summit scheduled for 8-9
September in Rio de Janeiro.
  Even though it is not on the agenda, the delegates will use
the meeting to probe preferences for the election of a new OAS
secretary general on 27 March in Washington.
  Diplomatic sources have stated that this issue will crop up
in lobby talks and even in the Rio Group's three flexible
sessions as any delegation head is allowed to raise it.
  Foreign Minister Burelli is one of the candidates for the
OAS
General Secretariat, replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena
Soares, whose five-year term ends in June.
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign
Minister Bernd Niehaus are also running.
  Foreign Minister Burelli indicated that the Rio Group must
forge "a social bias" for Latin American policy because "the
people eagerly want consideration in the decision-making
process."
  Burelli said: "Poverty represents a new scourge within
society as it has new elements of insecurity that cannot be
fought with armies. It is tied to hunger, terrorism, drug
trafficking, violence, and growing destitution."
  Burelli said that internal and external migration in Latin
American countries has helped to form "pockets" of misery in
large cities. He mentioned the migration from rural areas and
the arrival of about 60,000 Guyanese citizens in Venezuela.
They become involved in the underground economy.
  The people responsible for regional diplomacy will assess a
preliminary document entitled: "Poverty, Destitution, and
Unemployment." This document was compiled at the Rio Group's
request by experts from various governments, the Economic
Commission for Latin America (ECLA), and the United Nations.
  The document proposes guidelines to cure the phenomena and
will become a Rio Group's contribution for the UN Conference on
Social Development scheduled for 1995 in the city of Copenhagen.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) --
Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said
today that should Cuba want to join the OAS, it must comply with
the rule of democracy, hold elections, and respect human rights.
  Burelli told the media gathered at the Convention Center of
Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), where the Fourth Ibero-American
Summit is taking place on 14 and 15 June, "America is a
community that has a political system established by the OAS;
there is a government philosophy and a rule of democracy."
  He pointed out: "For Cuba to belong to this community, it
must comply with the rule of democracy; that is, it must hold
elections and respect human rights." He also pointed out he
hopes Cuban President Fidel Castro "takes the necessary steps to
join the community that is waiting for him."
  Answering a question on whether Castro's move from wearing
his green military uniform to wearing a guayabera shirt could be
interpreted as a his willingness to make changes, Burelli
replied: "I hope so!; I hope so!" This is the first time Castro
has dressed in something other than his uniform since the Cuban
Revolution succeeded in 1959. The Venezuelan foreign minister
stressed his government "is very interested" in the Cuban
economic changes, but it hopes these changes come along with
"political changes."
  During the summit's first session, Venezuelan President
Rafael Caldera said: "The time has come" for Cuba to join the
inter-American political and judicial systems and to change its
political system.
  Minister Burelli said the opposite with regard to Haiti: His
government opposes any "unilateral or multilateral" military
action in Haiti to put and end to the bitter crisis that is
engulfing that country. Burelli also reported his government
has requested the inclusion of the issue of corruption in the
summit agenda in order to issue a resolution to prevent
"granting asylum to corrupt people, just as drug traffickers are
denied asylum."

  [Text] Caracas, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Burelli has announced the creation of the
Association of Caribbean States, which he defined as an
important step within the process of regional integration.
Burelli, who made the announcement on Monday when he dedicated
the Department of Latin America and the Caribbean at the Central
University of Venezuela (UCV), explained that the association
will include all of the Caribbean states and will begin work on
4 July.
  As of 1969 and following the process of independence of the
countries forming part of Caribbean Common Market, Venezuela
designed an "unchanging policy of lending a hand" to these
nations with the sole purpose of serving its neighbors, the
foreign minister emphasized. Venezuela is the only country that
has 12 embassies and 10 cultural centers in the Caribbean. It
also signed the San Jose Pact with Mexico, which supplies
petroleum to those nations under special payment conditions. In
addition, the government in Caracas has signed a Caribbean
Development Bank exchange program that allows the granting of
recoverable lines of credit to the Caribbean countries.
  The Venezuelan foreign minister expressed his support for a
massive Venezuelan projection into the Caribbean that, with the
exception of Trinidad-Tobago and Guyana, is made up of small
nations without large resources and with a small population.

  [Text] Caracas, 18 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources confirmed
today the Venezuelan Government will study the possibility of
renewing oil supplies to Cuba based on an agreement with Russia.
  Venezuela supplied between 60,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil
per day to Cuba up to the latter part of 1991, based on an
agreement in which the former Soviet Union supplied a similar
amount of oil to the refineries of state-owned Venezuelan
Petroleum in Europe.
  Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said the
possibility of renewing this agreement "is an international
policy decision" which the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry will
handle.
  The initial agreement was suspended after the Soviet Union
disappeared, but both Russian and Cuban authorities, who have
visited Venezuela, have expressed their interest in renewing the
agreement.
  Arrieta did not reveal if the agreement will continue under
the former premises. A Russian delegation that visited
Venezuela in late 1993 reported the idea is for Cuba to pay for
the oil by supplying them with sugar.
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said
this week Cuban authorities have "a great interest" in reaching
an agreement on this matter and that it will be one of the
topics to be discussed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomydin's visit to Venezuela in June.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Celso Amorim stated today that his country endorses a consensus
candidate for the election of the OAS secretary general to be
held in Washington on 27 March.
  Amorim said that neither formal nor informal consultations
were made on the OAS vote during the two-day meeting of the 13
Rio Group foreign ministers that ended today.
  Brazil has promised to vote for Colombian President Cesar
Gaviria, contending that he would bring prestige to the OAS
because of his successful record as president of his country for
the four-year term that will end on 7 August.
  The foreign ministers and other government officials who
represented their countries at the Brasilia meeting, which
focused on the search for formulas to eradicate poverty and
unemployment and on reconciling positions for the continental
summit scheduled for December in Miami, sounded their
preferences for the 27 March vote.
  Ambassadors from the 35 OAS member countries will elect the
candidate to replace former Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister
Joao Baena Soares, who has served as OAS secretary general for
two consecutive five-year terms since 1984.
  In addition to Gaviria, the other two candidates are Costa
Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and Venezuelan Foreign
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli.
  Five positions have been identified within the Rio Group,
the
main forum for joint political and economic actions in Latin
America. They are the positions of the three groups supporting
each of the three candidates, the one advocating a formula for a
consensus candidate, and Ecuador's undecided position.
  Seven Rio Group member countries -- Mexico, Argentina,
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support
Gaviria; Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad-Tobago support Niehaus;
and Venezuela supports its foreign minister, Burelli.
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu today reaffirmed to
EFE his 21 March proposal of seeking a consensus candidate, who
could be any of the three candidates or someone else.
  The initiative to seek a consensus candidate, Abreu said,
"may appear to be vague, but it is a responsible one" in light
of the atmosphere of confrontation between the candidacies of
Gaviria and Niehaus. Abreu did not give further details of his
proposal.
  Abreu added: "An OAS election cannot be held in an
atmosphere
of confrontation. If we let matters take their course, we would
be starting a new term of the secretary general with divisions
already among its members."

  [Text] Caracas, 14 May (EFE) -- Venezuela will not support
a military intervention in Haiti, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said today in Caracas. The government, however, supports
pressure tactics to restore democracy in that Caribbean nation.
  According to the spokesman, Venezuela will not join any
armed
multinational force or support a unilateral decision by the
United States if that country decides to intervene in Haiti.
  Venezuela is the only Latin American country that belongs to
the Group of Friends of Haiti, which comprises the United
States, France, and Canada.
  The possibility of an armed intervention in Haiti has gained
strength after the military who toppled head of state
Jean-Bertrand Aristide appointed a puppet president. This week
the military, led by Raoul Cedras, who headed the coup,
appointed Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint president,
something the United Nations and the OAS have rejected. The
United Nations agreed to tighten the economic sanctions on the
Haitian military regime as of 21 May.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Uruguay has proposed
seeking a consensus candidate in the elections for OAS general
secretary to be held in Washington on 27 March. This proposal
was made in Brasilia today.
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu pointed out that the
initiative for seeking a consensus candidate "may seem a vague
response, but it is in fact a responsible one" given the
atmosphere of confrontation arising from the candidacies of
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign
Minister Bernd Niehaus.
  The third aspirant for replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao
Baena Soares is Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel
Burelli, who together with Abreu is participating in the two-day
meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers which was inaugurated
today at Itamaraty, the seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
  The Uruguayan Foreign Minister noted that the controversy
between groups of countries -- Central America and the Caribbean
support Niehaus, whereas North and South America endorse Gaviria
-- may lead to a split in the organization, which could have an
adverse effect on the tenure of the next secretary general.
  Abreu neither gave many details about his initiative, nor
did
he put forward for consideration the name of a possible
candidate. He said that his proposal had met with the approval
of the Rio Group delegations, especially those from countries
that fear a split in the OAS.
  Abreu stated: "The OAS ought not to go to elections with a
confrontation. If we leave things as they stand now, we will
start the new tenure of the General Secretariat with an
entrenched split."
  Seven of the 13 Rio Group nations -- Mexico, Argentina,
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support Gaviria
on the grounds that his election will bring prestige to the OAS,
as he has successfully discharged his duties as Colombian
president, his four-year term in office expiring in August.
  Although his country supports Gaviria, Argentine Deputy
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella seconded the idea of debating
a consensus formula.
  Within the Rio Group, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and
Tobago endorse Niehaus' candidacy. Only Venezuela endorses
Burelli.
  The other members of the group have not yet decided for whom
they will vote. Uruguay is in favor of reaching a consensus on
the candidacy, and Ecuador -- which had pledged to support
Niehaus in 1993 -- has recently indicated that it will not come
to a decision until the minute before each country's ambassador
hands in the ballots at the OAS headquarters.
  Diplomatic sources in Brasilia reported that if Gaviria
decides not to run for office, Bolivia would be willing to vote
for the Costa Rican foreign minister.
  In response to a question asked of him by reporters, Chilean
Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said that he will respect "the
commitment" to vote for Niehaus made by former President
Patricio Aylwin several years ago, when Gaviria was not yet a
candidate.
  This pledge is included in a joint declaration issued by
Aylwin and Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon -- both of whom
are Social Democrats -- after a meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast]
  [Text] The Venezuelan Government will send aid to Colombia,
where an avalanche razed eight towns in that country's southeast
on 6 June.
  There is no decision yet on what to do with 35 Venezuelan
families affected by the storm Bret and who are staying at Fort
Tiuna, but the Venezuelan Government has already decided to send
aid to the victims of the tremor in Colombia. Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has announced our country will assist
with 100 prefabricated houses for the families who lost their
homes.
  [Begin Burelli recording] Armed Forces airplanes will be
going. Helicopters may also go to see how we can help.
Contributions in this case do not involve medicine, blankets,
and medical teams composed of doctors and nurses, as is usually
the case. What is needed now is the reestablishment of
communications, electricity, and housing for those who have been
left completely destitute. [end recording]
  Burelli has also said no Haitians are coming to Venezuela.
He has said reports on the arrival of 120 people from Haiti are
the product of a lively imagination.
  Evidently contradicting what was said last week following a
meeting with Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of State, the
foreign minister has now said the number of undesirable
immigrants, who are causing problems in the country and
intensifying the social and economic drama Venezuelans are
enduring, will not increase.
  [Begin Burelli recording] This is the government's position.
I do not know the origin of the report on a certain group of
Haitians and their plight; this has never existed. We very much
want to help Haiti, and we help it at international forums. We
have a historical commitment. Recall that Simon Bolivar was
able to successfully and definitively return to Venezuela to
produce its independence thanks to help provided by Haitian
General Alexander Petion. Anything else is false. [end
recording]
  In conclusion, the minister has announced that on occasion
of
the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on
13 June the Group of Three [Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela] will
sign a free trade agreement that will count on the participation
of businessmen from the three countries to give practical
significance to the integration system.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast]
  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies has agreed to condemn
unanimously any U.S. military intervention in Haiti. In addition
to condemning any unilateral or multilateral military
intervention, through the agreement approved by the Chamber, the
lawmakers also decided to reject pressure from the United States
to receive quotas of Haitian refugees. The lawmakers also
demanded an end to the economic blockade on Haiti because they
believe it affects the innocent population instead of the
government.
  Deputy Herman Monzon, chairman of the Lower Chamber Foreign
Policy Commission, gives more details about this decision:
  [Begin Monzon recording, broadcast in progress] ...to
condemn
the possibility of an intervention in Haiti by the U.S. An
intervention of this nature would be a costly operation and it
would involve the possibility of loss of human lives and
material losses.
  I would recommend this money be used to develop Haiti. This
is an historic juncture. Venezuela must once more assume
leadership in Latin American to restore legitimacy in Haiti and
to support the Haitian people. The Haitian people need the help
of the entire international community. [end recording]
  In addition, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas
reiterated that so far our country has not received an asylum
request from Haitian refugees. The foreign minister made these
statements when leaving Congress after a summons by the Foreign
Policy Commission regarding Haitian refugees. When asked about
the number of Haitians who would enter the country, the foreign
minister, who was visibly disturbed, said the following:
  [Begin Burelli recording] You want me to say no flatly.
Obviously, a country that received assistance from Haiti at a
historical moment cannot say no. But we will only receive those
we deem convenient. The three, four, or five Haitians who will
help us investigate specific nuclear problems in Haiti will
come, just like Manigat and his wife did.
  But for heaven's sake, stop speculating that 150,000
Haitians
will come in planeloads or shiploads. Such speculations are
ill-intended. I said here many times that only 35 Haitians have
reached the U.S. ships off the coast of Jamaica. Of these, only
six Haitians qualified for asylum and 29 others were returned.
Just imagine, we will assess these cases in our embassy in
Washington, and the ambassador will call here or send us a note
when a Haitian who wants to go to Venezuela gets to the embassy.
[end recording]
  Finally, the foreign minister reiterated that the United
States has not pressured our country to accept Haitian refugees.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Diplomatic source told EFE
News Agency that some Rio Group foreign ministers -- who have
been holding talks in Brasilia for the last two days --
expressed certain reservations about the U.S. proposal that
Miami should host the next summit of the Americas convened by
the United States.
  Although the heads of Latin American diplomacy were
enthusiastic about U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal, some
of them expounded the "inadvisability" of holding the summit in
Miami, where anti-Castro groups have a lot of clout.
  The diplomats who assisted at the Brasilia meeting, which
ended today, told EFE that the issue was discussed at the
meeting, but did not disclose what delegations were opposed to
Miami being the venue for the summit meeting.
  The reservations stem from the fear that anti-Castro groups
will harass some heads of state on account of the independent
stance adopted by their countries and the Rio Group concerning
the U.S. policy vis-a-vis Cuba.
  The reservations seemingly reached the ears of U.S. Vice
President Albert Gore, who made a seven-hour visit to Brasilia
-- which extended from the evening of 21 March to the early
hours of 22 March -- to invite Brazilian President Itamar Franco
to the Miami summit.
  After the Rio Group meeting, Brazilian Foreign Minister
Celso
Amorim said Gore guaranteed him that matters alien to the summit
-- alluding to anti-Castro Cubans -- will not interfere in its
organization and agenda.
  Amorim noted that it is "too early" to say whether Cuba's
political and economic situation will be included on the
December summit's agenda.
  He further stated that both the summit's date and venue
depend on the decision of the U.S. Government, which convened
the meeting.
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli commented
that, in his view, Miami was not a "risky" place to bring
together all the heads of state in the Americas.
  Several Rio Group foreign ministers praised the flexibility
of the issues proposed by Clinton, who has asked governments to
offer suggestions to complete the agenda.
  The subjects put forward by Clinton to his Western
Hemisphere
counterparts include the strengthening of democracy, human
rights, trade, poverty, the environment, and the streamlining of
public administration.
  Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner told
EFE that his country is interested in highlighting trade
liberalization, economic investments, and cooperation at the
summit. Burelli, for his part, noted that questions like
education, poverty, and access to technology had to be part of
the agenda.
  Despite the fact that they differ widely on the types of
pressure that should be exerted on Cuba so it will adopt a
pluralistic system to replace the single-party system, Rio Group
countries have condemned the trade embargo on Cuba imposed by
the United States more than 30 years ago.
  Brazil and Colombia recently have become the target of
criticism and threats by anti-Castro groups due to their stances
on the situation in Havana.

  [Text] Caracas, 15 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Defense Minister
General Rafael Montero Revette said today he does not think "the
installation of foreign military forces will be accepted" in his
country; he was referring to the possibility the United States
could install a military base in Venezuela.
  Montero told journalists the topic was discussed during a
meeting he had yesterday with General Barry McCaffrey, commander
in chief of the U.S. Southern Command.
  Montero refused to comment on whether Colombia will permit
the installation of U.S. military forces in its territory.
  "We cannot speculate on that, and I do not know if Colombia
will accept it," Montero said. He said, however, the Venezuelan
Armed Forces' position is contrary to a foreign military
presence in the country.
  Montero said during his meeting with McCaffrey they
discussed
relations between both countries' Armed Forces and the
drug-trafficking problem.
  Regarding President Cesar Gaviria's proposal of creating an
OAS multilateral military force, he said: "Each country is
sovereign, and we are not going to have a regional intervention
force; we do not favor creating a multilateral force."
  Regarding the internal political situation, Montero said:
"Venezuela knows it wants peace and to overcome the present
economic crisis." He ruled out a possible new military uprising
if the government does not overcome the present crisis, contrary
to what Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the 4 February
1992 coup attempt, has said.

  [Text] Caracas, 19 Feb (EFE) -- Today, Major General
Egberto Artuza Delgado, National Guard [GN] commander, reported
the Venezuelan Armed Forces are prepared to defend sovereignty
in the face of a possible attack by Colombian guerrillas on
border towns. The high-ranking officer said the GN, the Navy,
and the Army have beefed up security in Casdualito, the
Venezuelan town bordering Colombia, in anticipation of a new
guerrilla attack. "We are absolutely sure they will carry out
future attacks against our installations and we are ready for
that," he asserted.
  Artuza Delgado said the civilian population of the southwest
region of Venezuela can rest assured the Armed Forces will
safeguard their physical safety and will protect their
properties. Meanwhile, the GN commander reported that this
Venezuelan force had not arrested the Brazilian gold prospectors
and also denied entering the Brazilian territorial space.
  The general remarked the Venezuelan Armed Forces respect the
borders and are perfectly aware of their location. He added that
in the last operation conducted in the area bordering Brazil,
Venezuelan military authorities destroyed 88 "gold prospecting"
camps and 11 rafts used by the illegal miners. The officer
concluded that "the illegal Brazilian miners, who profit from
the illegal exploitation of our land, want to create friction at
the international level so as to weaken the work being done at
the border."

  [Text] Caracas, 20 Feb (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Foreign
Ministry has announced in an official communique that Carlos
Gottberg, the Venezuelan consul general in Colombia, was not
hurt in a terrorist attack which took place in the Colombian
city of Medellin early this morning.
  The bomb explosion at the offices of the Venezuelan
consulate
did not inflict any casualties but it did cause serious property
damage.
  When informed about the situation, German Carreras Damas,
the
Venezuelan ambassador to Colombia, immediately made contact with
the consular offices in Medellin and requested an explanation
from the Colombian Government.
  Foreign Ministry sources told EFE that the Venezuelan
Government will formally ask the Colombian authorities for their
cooperation in providing the proper protection to its diplomats
on the territory of the neighboring country.

<F P=106> [By Herold Jean Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 12 Jun (EFE) -- Emile Jonassaint,
the de facto president of Haiti, today declared a state of
emergency in the country and ordered coupist General Raoul
Cedras to take every possible measure to deal with whatever may
happen.
  Jonassaint also called on the Haitian people to unite to
meet
an invasion. "If we have to die, we will die together,"
Jonassaint said in a message to the people aired at 0130 local
(0530 GMT) and in which he announced the measures taken.
  In his message, he strongly criticized the international
community for the plan to restore democracy in the country and
the threats of a foreign invasion. Jonassaint said Haiti has
done nothing wrong to foreigners and that he cannot understand
the reason for a probable invasion. As for the restoration of
democracy, he asked: "What democracy are we talking about?
When did such a democracy exist in Haiti?"
  Jonassaint accused Jean-Bertrand Aristide of squandering the
country's wealth by "giving it to the whites."
  Referring to Aristide's return to Haiti, but without
mentioning the constitutional president by name, Jonassaint
said: "If he is that strong, why does he not come alone?"
  In stating that the Haitians will never accept a return to
slavery, Jonassaint alluded to Haiti's Independence Act, which
proclaims "liberty or death."
  The chief of the de facto government also made reference to
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who has been
imprisoned on charges of embezzlement and theft after having
been linked to the Haiti case. Jonassaint continued by
referring to foreign leaders involved in the search for a
solution to the Haitian crisis, saying: "Soon the others will
face the same fate." [sentence as received]
  The Haitian Constitution does not envisage a state of
emergency, but it does cover conditions for a state of siege.
Political observers in the Haitian capital believe that the
declaration of the state of emergency is a disguise for
establishing a state of siege to restrict the citizens'
liberties. Because of the time at which Jonassaint's message
was broadcast, few people have been informed about the de facto
president's decision, and for this reason, it will be necessary
to wait until Monday to determine what the reaction will be.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has
categorically denied our country is volunteering to become a
camp for Haitian refugees. The official explained the small
group of Haitians who qualify as political refugees will stay
temporarily in the country. In addition, he described as
exaggerated the remarks by members of the opposition who said
the country is experiencing a crisis situation and already has a
needy alien population. The foreign minister finds this is an
exaggeration, oh well. Burelli Rivas also said Venezuela will
support UN agreements on the mission that will be operating in
Haiti but explained the solution to the problems of that
Caribbean nation depends not only on the restoration of
democracy, but also on the cooperation of neighboring countries
to improve the living conditions of Haitians, who otherwise will
emigrate. In the opinion of Deputy Geman Monzon, chairman of the
Foreign Policy Committee, our country lacks the necessary
conditions to receive Haitian refugees.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican
Government warned today it will not allow the presence of
foreign troops in its territory to reinforce the embargo against
the Haitian military.
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told EFE: "In
no
way will we (the Dominican Government) accept foreign troops in
order to reinforce the border."
  The high-ranking official referred to Argentine President
Carlos Menem's possible offer to send Argentine troops to the
Dominican border with Haiti to reinforce the blockade against
the military coupists.
  Menem will present this proposal during a meeting to be held
tomorrow in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
according to high-ranking diplomatic sources in Buenos Aires
quoted by the Buenos Aires daily CLARIN.
  Fifteen days ago, Argentina became part of the "Friends of
Haiti Club," which also includes the United States, France,
Canada, and Venezuela.
  Herrera said the Dominican Foreign Ministry had no knowledge
of Menem's proposal and explained that what the Dominican
Government agreed to with the United Nations -- and "the United
States is aware of this" -- is the presence of "approximately 20
observers" who would work together with Dominican authorities.
The deputy minister added that the mission would consist of
individuals, including military, of various nations, but he said
five or six military personnel "cannot be considered a troop."
  He added: "We do not accept any foreign troops in Dominican
territory to carry out something that corresponds to a bilateral
matter. We are not at war with Haiti or anyone" and thus cannot
accept the presence of military troops on Dominican territory.
  He explained that the Dominican Government is complying with
the UN provisions and that it will receive the necessary
reinforcements, but this will be in advisory and logistical
support.
  After saying the Argentine Embassy "in no way" had made
contact with the Foreign Ministry to discuss the Haitian crisis,
he said his government had not received the logistical support
which the international organizations has promised.
  "We are absorbing the economic cost of maintaining the
Dominican troops on the border with no assistance, up until now,
from any international organization," said the deputy minister.
Nevertheless, he said despite the heavy cost the embargo
represents for the Dominican Government, his country is still
guarding the border while the international community's
sanctions prevail against the "de facto" Haitian Government.

  [Text] Manaus (Brazil), 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Manaus Federal
Police Superintendency reported today that the armed forces of
Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru have been invited by
Brazil to join a large operation to block the drug trafficking
mafia operating in the Amazon River basin.
  Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the plan was presented to
those countries during the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting of
the Armed Forces held in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira last week.
  Sposito said Venezuela already has confirmed its
participation in the campaign that will be named the "Blocking
Operation" [Operacion Bloqueo] and Colombia hinted that it also
will support it.
  The Manaus (capital of Amazonas State) police superintendent
explained that the plan includes the establishment of an
information network among the armed forces of the countries
sharing the Amazon basin.
  Sposito added that in Brazil the operation will cover all
the
federal organizations in Amazonas State and the national and
multinational fuel distribution companies. Sposito said 200
Federal Police officers will work exclusively on the operation.
  Sposito also indicated that the "Blocking Operation" has the
basic purpose of fighting drug trafficking at the Brazilian
border with the other four countries.
  Brazil also intends to be excluded from the list of
countries
used as transit routes by international drug traffickers.
Sposito pointed out that Brazil and Venezuela have become the
first countries on the cocaine route that starts in Colombia and
ends in the United States and Europe.
  Therefore, said Sposito, the Colombian Armed Forces'
participation will be essential for the operation's success.
  The "Blocking Operation" seeks to intercept the flow of
cocaine on the Amazon River by integrating the Brazilian river
police patrols in Tabatinga (at the Colombian border) with the
Manaus police.
  The operation also includes a follow-up by Brazil on actions
against drug traffickers in Colombia.
  Strict air traffic control in the Amazon region that
includes
the destruction of fuel supply networks and clandestine
airfields, as well as the neutralization of the air space in the
large Amazon basin, are the main aspects of the "Blocking
Operation."
  The operation also will include two radio centers, which
began operating last November, in Tabatinga and Tefe (Amazonas
State) to intercept the drug trafficking routes.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Andean countries
receiving trade benefits from the EU as compensation for their
fight against the drug trade today proposed that the European
Commission [EC] extend similar benefits to Venezuela, which also
is committed to fighting drugs.
  The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries
receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the
foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a
Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for
Latin America.
  In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin
said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of
extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs
trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the
drug trade."
  Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are
entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special
paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a
mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American
countries.
  Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean
countries
to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and
expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other
EC members.
  The GSP expires late this year and the EU must decide
whether
to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or expand
it.
  The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest
in
having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits
the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement
efforts be extended to Venezuela.
  The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers
was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and
EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament
building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.
  Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign
ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member
countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP.
  Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign
ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as
observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America,
respectively.
  The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros
Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other
EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom).
  Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which
institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the
main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic
action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held
three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second
in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen
(April 1993).

  [Text] Caracas, 19 Jan (EFE) -- The government intervention
of Banco Latino, one of the largest in Venezuela, has affected
the country's image abroad, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando
Ochoa Antich said today.
  The foreign minister said the crisis of Banco Latino and its
subsequent intervention, which the government ordered last week,
has "damaged the image" of Venezuela in the international
financial world.
  The bank closed its doors 14 January due to a serious crisis
of liquidity, after some 55 billion bolivars (some $514 million)
were withdrawn over the last three months, according to reports
by the bank board of directors.
  Ochoa said the government's intervention is aimed at
protecting the deposits of depositors and defining what is the
real situation of that bank.
  At the end of last year, Banco Latino was the Venezuelan
financial institution with the largest amount of deposits and
the third largest credit portfolio holder. The government
intervention may have significant consequences in the national
economic area.
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said Venezuelan authorities
must establish clearly the criminal responsibilities that may
exist in this case, in which the savings of thousands of
depositors and Venezuelan Government institutions have been
endangered.
  Venezuelan judicial authorities have ordered an
investigation
to establish if the Banco Latino directors have committed
embezzlement against that financial institution.

  [Text] Caracas, 6 Apr EFE -- The Venezuelan Government
today denied that this country is a drug producer and said that,
on the contrary, it is a role model for cooperation in the
struggle against these illegal substances.
  The Venezuelan Government, through a Foreign Ministry note,
termed "distorted" recent publications identifying Venezuela as
being among the countries with the most drug trafficking.
  The Foreign Ministry note refers to the "Annual Report on
the
Strategy for the Control of Drugs at the International Level,"
presented by the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Congress.
  The Foreign Ministry explains that according to this report,
"Venezuela is not a narcotics producing nation but a transit
point for drugs going from Colombia to the United States and
Europe."
  The Foreign Ministry further states that "Venezuela is among
those nations that have given exemplary cooperation in the
struggle against drugs," recalling a long list of international
agreements signed toward that goal.
  The Foreign Ministry cited "as an example of the permanent
struggle against this scourge" the confiscation of 3,405 kg of
various drugs in 1993 by Venezuelan police.
  The official document notes that Venezuela "suffers the
consequences of the illegal trafficking of narcotics and
psychotropic substances, particularly of money laundering, a
corollary of drug trafficking." It requests the cooperation of
the U.S. Government as "it is time to face this problem
together."

  [Text] Caracas, 10 Jun (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Miguel
Angel Burelli Rivas said today Haitian refugees will not come to
his country, and that topic "has only existed in the imagination
of some."
  The foreign minister acknowledged the U.S. Government had
made a request to Venezuela to accept a group of refugees, but
they will definitely not be received. "We have sufficient
poverty and masses of uninvited immigrants here who are causing
us problems, and we are not going to increase those problems
with groups of foreigners," Burelli Rivas indicated.
  Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom also commented on this
matter, stating Venezuela cannot be tasked with resolving the
problems of the peoples of other countries. The official added
that "all the immigrants who want to cannot enter our country,
only those who are part of a selective immigration program based
on the national interest."
  Opposing the arrival of refugees are political and social
sectors, including the Senate Foreign Policy Committee. Through
its chairwoman, Haydee Castillo, the Committee indicated on
Tuesday that "the country does not have the economic and social
conditions to receive those persons."

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 Jun (EFE) -- Today, the
organization known as "Capois-La-Mort," which includes
high-ranking extreme right-wing soldiers, demanded strict
measures against foreigners and the closure of the
Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitiene airports. In addition, they
demanded an end to diplomatic relations with France, Canada,
Venezuela, and the United States and declared the ambassadors of
these countries persona non grata. According to their demands,
no foreign airplanes should be allowed to land at the Haitian
capital or at any other airport.
  The demands were listed in a communique issued today. Among
other things, the document asks for border officials to ban the
entry of foreigners crossing the Dominican Republic border. The
document also demands cutting off water, power, and telephone
services to foreign embassies and those "collaborating with the
enemy."
  The military group suggests and even demands giving the
French, Canadian, Venezuelan, and U.S. ambassadors 48 hours to
leave Haiti. If they choose to remain in the country, the group
recommends limiting their movements as well as the movements of
other diplomatic representatives, consuls, and members of
international agencies.
  They call for ambassadors and other foreign government
officials to be ordered to remain within a 15 km radius of their
official domicile. According to the communique outlining the
special measures, in order for these people to travel outside
the said 15 km perimeter, they must first get approval from the
Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Armed Forces.
  "Capois-La-Mort" considers the strict sanctions ordered
against the country and backed by the international community,
as "a declaration of war against the black Republic of Haiti."
The organization urges the government to approve special "war
measures," to enable it to respond to the "foreign aggression."
  The written demands presented by "Capois-La-Mort" come while
rumors of a foreign military invasion of Haiti spread.
Observers see the demands as evidence that the military and its
collaborators could take extreme measures.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Martinez] </F>
  [Excerpt] Quito, 16 Apr (EFE) -- One million Amazonian
Indians from Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil,
Bolivia, French Guiana, and Suriname have rejected the Brazilian
Government's plan for radar surveillance of that jungle region
because they believe that it is a plan to militarize and
colonize the region.
  In a communique issued in Quito this week, the Coordinating
Board of Indian Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA)
requests that the Brazilian Government spend the $1 billion
budgeted for that project on the construction of hospitals,
schools, and health centers.
  Last week, Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, Brazilian secretary
for strategic affairs, presented the plan for "the protection
and exploitation of natural resources, the protection of Indian
areas, and the control of illegal actions," with the help of
radar surveillance of the Amazon region. Flores invited other
Amazonian countries to join in this project. He said that
Colombia and Venezuela had shown interest in it and specified
that "it was a system for protection, not military defense," but
the Indians do not believe this.
  "We do not need the military to protect us. Thanks, anyway.
What we need is to be left alone, recognition our territories,
and the right to a large share of what is produced in them," the
COICA communique states. "We know you intend to militarize an
approximately 20-mile wide strip throughout thousands of
kilometers of the jungle, much of which is Indian territory,"
the communique adds. "If you divide the $1 billion you will
spend to `protect us' among the million Indians who live here,
that will give us $1,000 per person," the communique points out.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Andean countries
receiving trade benefits from the EU as compensation for their
fight against the drug trade today proposed that the European
Commission [EC] extend similar benefits to Venezuela, which also
is committed to fighting drugs.
  The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries
receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the
foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a
Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for
Latin America.
  In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin
said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of
extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs
trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the
drug trade."
  Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are
entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special
paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a
mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American
countries.
  Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean
countries
to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and
expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other
EC members.
  The GSP expires late this year, and the EU must decide
whether to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or
expand it.
  The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest
in
having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits
the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement
efforts be extended to Venezuela.
  The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers
was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and
EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament
building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.
  Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign
ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member
countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP.
  Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign
ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as
observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America,
respectively.
  The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros
Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other
EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom).
  Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which
institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the
main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic
action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held
three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second
in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen
(April 1993).

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 7 Mar (EFE) -- Port-au-Prince Mayor
Evans Paul, who is also leader of the National Front for Change
and Democracy (FNCD) today proposed a modification to the plan
approved Wednesday [2 March] by the Chamber of Deputies to try
to find a solution to the new deadlock in the Haitian crisis
created by the [congressional] resolution.
  Paul recommended "a commitment acceptable for President
(Jean- Bertrand) Aristide, as well as for the other sectors
involved in the crisis." In an interview for EFE, Paul blamed
the international community and domestic sectors that have
promoted the current deadlock, for the Haitian crisis.
  "It is necessary to modify the proposal, which cannot be
viewed as a plan yet. In order for it to become a plan,
President Aristide and the other sectors must accept it," Paul
said. "The international community has not adopted a firm
position on the measures contained in the Governor's Island
Accord and the ultimatum given to the military leaders by four
countries (France, Canada, the United States, and Venezuela)
which expired on 15 January," Paul stressed.
  The FNCD leader said that some sectors support the dilatory
tactics that have prolonged the Haitian crisis since 30
September 1991, when a group of military leaders overthrew
Constitutional President Aristide. Paul also mentioned the lack
of cohesion in the democratic sector, which has favored a "fatal
confusion and a rotten situation," adding that the same
situation prevails in the parliament.
  The political leader said that different groups are acting
in
the Haitian political scene against democracy. "While some
people are reacting emotionally and others are trying to
maintain the situation of crisis, we must admit that there are
others who are acting in good faith," Paul added.
  With regard to differences expressed within the FNCD and the
support for the parliamentarian resolution from the Party of the
National Congress of Democratic Movements (CONACOM), Paul said
those are normal situations in the various fronts and political
coalitions. As an example, he mentioned the Nicaraguan
Sandinist National Liberation Front and the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front in El Salvador.
  Paul, who said he is confident some legislators will change
their position, said that "the FNCD's position has not changed
and is based on strengthening democracy and respecting the
democratic rules of the game."

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 17 Mar (EFE) -- Argentine Senator Luis
Rubeo, secretary of the Latin American Parliament [Parlatino]
committees, on 17 March dismissed rumors spread from Venezuela
that the Venezuelan Congress might not join Parlatino, which
groups 22 countries in the region.
  Asked about the absence of Venezuelan deputies during the
committee meetings being held at the Parlatino's permanent seat
in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Sen. Rubeo said: "This is a natural
consequence of political readjustments that occur after new
officials are elected."
  The Venezuelan congressmen who are members of the Parlatino
committees could not travel to Sao Paulo because President
Rafael Caldera's Convergence Party, which recently became the
ruling party, demanded a revision of all international
activities by the Venezuelan Congress. As a result, the
deputies' trip was not authorized.
  Rubeo said: "We support the winds of austerity blowing in
the
brotherly country, but we are sure that Venezuela will not give
up the privileged positions it has won in the international
community thanks to its fervent effort to support continental
integration."
  "Through me, Parlatino urges the Venezuelan congressmen to
continue participating in this task aimed at drafting programs
that will end hunger and inequalities in the continent," Sen.
Rubeo said.
  Venezuelan Deputy Henry Bencid, Parlatino vice president for
Venezuela, said in Caracas on 16 March that his country risks
staying out of Parlatino because "Convergence opposes Congress
complying with its international commitments."
  According to Bencid, who is a leader of the opposition
Social-Christian Party [COPEI], Convergence's attitude results
from a "misunderstood" position of austerity, which has been
announced by the new administration.
  The Venezuelan deputy asserted that a revision of the
Venezuelan Congress' international activities, as demanded by
President Caldera, might imply derogation of the law that
approved Parlatino's institutionalization.
  Bencid said that if this occurred, the Venezuelan Congress
would have to quit Parlatino and lose the benefits granted by it.
  Currently, several Venezuelan congressmen occupy important
positions in Parlatino. The president, for example, is Social
Democratic Action Party Deputy Humberto Celli, and the vice
presidents of three committees are Venezuelan deputies.

  [Text] Caracas, 5 Jun (AFP) -- Starting this week, Haitians
fleeing their country will be taken to three U.S. ships [not
further identified] anchored off Jamaica, and those who can
demonstrate refugee status will travel to any member nation of
the group "Friends of Haiti," it was reported today.
  Guy Prim, representative for Venezuela and the Caribbean of
the UN Office of the High Commisssioner on Human Rights [UNHCR],
said this international organization will pay for the operation,
which is expected to amount to about $1.5 million.
  In statements to the Caracas media, Prim said the difficult
situation facing Haiti makes its 6.9 million inhabitants
"potential asylum seekers." He announced that starting this
week, Haitians who flee their country will be housed aboard
three U.S. ships anchored off the Port of Kingston, Jamaica.
One of the ships will serve as a hospital.
  He added that two commissions will be tasked with
classifying
the guests. These commissions will include an UNHCR commission
consisting of 10 jurists and 10 translators and a commission of
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service consisting of 50
officials.
  Prim said those who manage to demonstrate refugee status
during an interview will be informed about the possibility of
going to any member country of the group "Friends of Haiti."
This group is composed of Canada, United States, France,
Argentina, and Venezuela.
  Prim, however, voiced his concern that Haitians might not
want to go to other countries because they are obsessed with
traveling to the United States. He bases his concern on a
recent experience when a majority of a group of Haitians who
failed to reach U.S. coasts returned to their native island.
  In Venezuela, Prim added, the Social Pastoral Office of the
Bishop's Conference reached an agreement with the UNHCR to offer
lodging to Haitians welcomed by the administration of President
Rafael Caldera. Yesterday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel
Angel Burelli Rivas said his country will welcome refugees for
as long as the difficult situation on the island persists.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast]
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has strongly
criticized the Argentine Senate's statement on the legal
proceedings of the trial of former Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez. Burelli believes the Argentine parliament has no
right to interfere in Venezuelan affairs. Vicente Briceno
reports:
  [Briceno] As the foreign minister left the special Council
of
Ministers meeting at Miraflores Palace, he said the branches of
the Venezuelan Government have properly handled the case of
former President Perez. Despite the Argentine Senate's
statement, he said Venezuela will not break relations with the
Argentine Government, because the Senate issued that statement,
not the executive branch. He also said Venezuela will not send a
protest note to Argentina, because the Venezuelan diplomatic
delegation in that country handles these types of statements by
expressing regret over them.
  [Begin Burelli recording] The government branches have
seriously and flawlessly handled Perez's case. Congress, in its
own right, and the judicial branch have intervened in the case,
thus allowing the former president to enjoy the rights to which
he is entitled. The process has been so impeccable that Perez's
own party had expelled him as the judicial branch made a
decision. The Venezuelan Senate and state would never dare give
opinions on decisions that foreign governments have made. [end
recording]
  [Briceno] Burelli again broached the controversial case of
the Haitians who will reportedly be granted asylum in Venezuela,
a case which has triggered opposing opinions in the executive
cabinet. He has said that only those Haitians whom the
government has approved will be granted asylum and that our
embassy will select them. The exact number of these Haitians has
yet to be determined, however.

  [Text] Caracas, 10 Feb (EFE) -- Venezuelan Omar Baralt,
head of the Presidential Commission on Border Affairs currently
negotiating with Colombia, today reported that more than 80,000
Colombian guerrillas are operating along the vast Colombian
border region.
  The official pointed out that the worst infiltration in
Venezuela lies in and around the northwestern town of Sierra de
Perija, where authorities have neglected some 400 km in which 37
fronts of the Colombian guerrillas operate. Baralt said that
while only 2 million Venezuelans live in this area, it is
inhabited by some 7 million Colombians. According to Baralt,
"between fighters and members of the logistical apparatus, the
guerrillas have 80,000 men in the area."
  Baralt stressed that the Venezuelan Government has to
persuade the Colombian Government to open a dialogue with the
guerrillas because the Colombian Army cannot be deployed across
the border. Baralt added that Venezuela cannot get directly
involved in this problem, but that it must seek a diplomatic
solution because belligerent actions could mean the destruction
of the country's main agricultural centers.
  The Venezuelan official said that migrant workers represent
another border problem, because Colombians provide most of the
manual labor in the agricultural and cattle zones. He believes
this problem must be resolved by issuing identification cards to
illegal immigrants to integrate them into the country's
production process.
  Baralt pointed out that one of the positive aspects of the
two countries' bilateral relations is the 70 percent decrease in
smuggling activities because of the creation of a free trade
zone between Colombia and Venezuela. He added, however, that
Colombia's Maicao zone has become the foremost international
trade center in the Caribbean Basin, with imports amounting to
$1.5 billion in 1993. He recommended the signing of a bilateral
agreement to regulate trade in this zone.

  [Text] Lima, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Congressman Paciano
Padron, the president of the Andean Parliament, stated today
that the Andean Parliament is opposed to the commercial blockade
against Cuba and Haiti as a way to restore democracy in both
countries.
  In remarks to the magazine CCD [Democratic Constituent
Congress], the official mouthpiece of the Peruvian Congress,
Padron said: "It is a bad idea to continue the blockade against
Cuba and Haiti because the people have the right to survive and
subsist."
  The Andean Parliament president said: "It is not ethical to
submit a nation to starvation in the name of democracy."
  Padron added that commercial blockades, like that imposed
recently on Haiti and the one that has prevailed for 32 years
against Cuba, "affect the people, not the generals or officials
who continue drinking wine and eating meat while the people have
nothing to quench their thirst or assuage their hunger."
  The Venezuelan congressman asked the OAS to find a political
solution to the Haitian and Cuban problems and to conduct all
necessary diplomatic negotiations "instead of settling for less
humane alternatives."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 22
March.
  Alfredo Acedo Machado, president of the Acedo Mendoza group,
today addressed a group of Venezuelan and Colombian investors
who met in Caracas and spoke about corporate business strategies
and growth strategies of Venezuelan corporations. Acedo Machado
pointed out that movements of capital in Latin America have
grown considerably and that foreign investments in 1992 in six
countries of the region amounted to $12.3 billion. He added
that the main investments between 1992 and 1993 were registered
in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA
ECONOMIA in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 11)
  Javier Gomez-Navarro, the Spanish minister of commerce and
tourism who is visiting Caracas, announced that Spain has
granted the greatest amount of soft credits to Venezuela, to the
tune of $300 million. Gomez-Navarro added that he seeks to
reestablish commercial contacts in the service and tourism
sectors. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 23)
  The Central Bank of Venezuela today sold bonds in the amount
of $327 million that will mature in 91 and 182 days. The bank
has weekly sales aimed at controlling liquidity, reducing
pressure on the dollar exchange rate, and halting the
advancement of inflation. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2326 GMT 16 Mar

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 18 May (EFE) -- Today,
Constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval urged Haitian
university students to continue the struggle to preserve
democratic achievements and to defeat conservative forces.
  Meanwhile, in a radio and television message, de facto
President Emile Jonassaint called for Haitian unity. Malval and
Jonassaint spoke on separate occasions during the celebrations
to mark University and Flag Day. According to Jonassaint, this
unity is as important "as the unity that led to the creation of
the flag on 18 May 1803."
  The U.S., Venezuelan, Taiwan, and Mexican ambassadors, the
Canadian and French charges d'affaires, and the Papal Nuncio met
with Malval at his Chante Brise home to express their support.
In statements to journalists, the diplomats noted that their
presence at Malval's home clearly expresses their rejection of
the "supposed" de facto government and their support for
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30
September 1991 by a military group led by General Raoul Cedras.
The diplomats added that Aristide and Malval represent the
constitutional legitimacy of Haiti.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 4
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.
  On 28 December, the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV)
auctioned
4 billion bolivares ($37.77 million) worth of "zero coupon"
bonds. The bonds, due on 30 March 94, will have a yield of 50.54
percent, two points less than the previous week. Brokerage
firms took $22 million worth of the bonds, financial firms $8
million, and commercial banks $7.7 million. (Madrid EFE in
Spanish 2208 GMT 28 Dec 93)
  The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office (OCEI)
reported on 29 December that unemployment in Venezuela at the
end of 1993 was 6.6 percent, while the so-called "informal
sector" of the economy grew by 116,700 jobs and employed 40.8
percent of the working population. OCEI also reported that the
economically active population totals 7,582,345; 93.4 percent
were employed during the second half of 1993. It added that the
government eliminated 65,000 jobs and employed 1,198,611
workers, 16.9 percent of the country's work force. (Madrid EFE
in Spanish 2112 GMT 29 Dec 93)
  Energy and Mines Minister Alirio Parra said the state budget
for PDVSA (Venezuelan Petroleum) for 1994 is 1.065 trillion
bolivares, based on a price per barrel of oil of $13.50.
Profits are expected to be approximately $12 billion. He added
that 1994 exports will be 2.23 million barrels per day and that
the operational objectives of the budget aim at increasing the
country's reserves by 172 million barrels through exploration of
new areas. Regarding PDVSA's affiliates abroad, the minister
said they should net $142 million with an investment of $536
million. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL In Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 2-6)
  The BCV reported on 2 January that Venezuela's international
reserves dropped $324 million during 1993, closing the year at
$12.677 billion. However, the reduction of international
reserves in 1993 was still less than the reduction registered in
1992 when they dropped $1.104 billion. In December 1993
Venezuela's international reserves increased $261 million.
(Paris AFP in Spanish 2241 GMT 2 Jan 94)
  The BCV reported on 3 January that 1993 inflation was 45.9
percent, the second highest in 35 years, surpassed only by the
81 percent inflation rate registered in 1989. The BCV added
that in December prices increased 3.6 percent. The state bank
also reported that implementation of the value-added tax in
October caused the inflation rate of December to increase 0.4
percent, less than the 0.6 percent November increase. Inflation
in 1993 surpassed the 1992 rate -- 31.9 percent -- by 14 points;
it is expected that in 1994 it will drop and remain between 35
percent and 40 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2124 GMT 3 Jan

  [Text] Belem do Para, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Today, OAS Permanent
Council President Denneth Modeste said the Caribbean member
countries of Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] have not ruled
out any option for reestablishing democracy in Haiti, including
military intervention.
  During a news conference in which he spoke on behalf of
Caricom members, Modeste said that "if the sanctions do not
attain the desired objective, we do not rule out any option" for
reestablishing democracy in Haiti, including the military option.
  "We believe the flagrant human rights violations against the
poor Haitian people have been going on for too long," Modeste
said, adding that before considering a military operation one
should wait for the strengthening of the embargo against the
Haitian coupists to see if this is effective.
  Modeste, who represents Grenada before the OAS, added that
the Caricom members have sent "a strong message to the Haitian
authorities, and we expect them to respect their people's will
to reestablish President Jean Bertrand Aristide in power."
  During the OAS General Assembly taking place in this
Brazilian coastal city, the foreign ministers of the OAS member
countries approved a resolution to intensify the trade embargo
against Haiti, asking for total compliance. Regarding the
express prohibition against launching armed action against other
countries, which is specified in the OAS Charter, Modeste said
"it did not prevent the reestablishment of democracy in Grenada
through military intervention." He said this in reference to
the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983. Modeste stressed the
democratic progress attained in Grenada, adding that "for this
reason Grenada does not rule out any action."
  Despite the call for admitting Haitian refugees, as
mentioned
in the resolution on Haiti, Modeste said the Caricom countries
cannot accept more of them because of the problems that many
Caribbean countries have in offering them assistance and
services.
  "The problem of the refugees reflects what is going on in
Haiti, and we must attempt to address the cause rather than the
effects, and the cause is human rights violations in Haiti,"
Modeste said.
  As for the possibility that Grenada could participate in a
possible military operation against the Haitian coupists, who
usurped power from Aristide in September 1991, Modeste said
Grenada "does not have an Army," but would be willing to help
train "a more responsible Haitian police" once the military
return power to Aristide.
  The Haitian crisis has been one of the central points
discussed at the OAS General Assembly, which began on 6 June and
could end tomorrow, a day earlier than scheduled, given the
swiftness with which the various committees advanced in their
work.

  [Text] Caracas, 1 May (EFE) -- Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who
was appointed new president of Banco Central of Venezuela (BCV),
took office today, Sunday, and called an urgent meeting of the
bank's board of directors.
  Casas Gonzalez was appointed BCV president after the
unexpected 26 April resignation of Ruth de Krivoy, who held that
post for the past two years.
  Krivoy resigned alleging deep differences with the way the
government had handled the delicate financial crisis in
mid-January when Banco Latino, the country's second most
important one at the time, was intervened.
  After the Latino Bank crisis, an additional eight banks had
to receive assistance of the state, which diverted almost 5
billion [currency unspecified] in financial aid to prevent a
massive bankruptcy of banks.
  During the past weeks President Rafael Caldera assigned
Gustavo Roosen, intervener of Banco Latino, to design a plan
that will restore confidence in the financial system and lower
the ceiling on interest rates, which is over 60 percent.
  This decision by Caldera and other decisions by Roosen to
carry out the assigned task were viewed by Krivoy as state
interference in monetary policy affairs, which Venezuelan laws
reserve for the BCV and, therefore, shows a lack of respect for
the bank's autonomy.
  After learning of Krivoy's resignation, the government and
Senate agreed to appoint Casas Gonzalez, who up until that time
had represented the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum before the
British Government and other European countries.
  Following Krivoy's resignation, the local stock market got
out of control "completely, and the Venezuelan bolivar suffered"
a heavy devaluation compared to the U.S. dollar. This will be
the first problem the new BCV authorities will resolve.
  Economists Domingo Maza Zavala and Miguel Ignacio Purroy and
Casas Gonzalez were sworn in as new BCV directors.
  Casas Gonzalez, an economist, was deputy minister of
development between 1969 and 1972 and planning minister between
1972 and 1974, both times under the Caldera administration. The
Senate unanimously supported his appointment as BCV president.

  [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- Today, the Venezuelan
Government announced a series of changes in President Rafael
Caldera's cabinet. These changes are designed to improve
coherence in the government team. According to Guillermo
Alvarez, chief of the Central Information Office, the new
development minister will be Alberto Poletto, president of the
Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. Poletto will continue to be
president of the ICE, and in the future, this office will become
the ministry of industry and commerce.
  Luis Carlos Palacios, the current development minister, will
head the Central Office of Coordination and Planning. Palacios
will replace Enzo del Bufalo who, according to the press,
resigned because of serious differences with the other members
of the economic cabinet.
  Ciro Zaa, currently minister of urban development, has been
appointed transport and communications minister. Zaa replaces
Cesar Quintini who was accused of not being willing to attack
the corruption spotted in the department by former Deputy
Transport and Communications Minister Rafael Iribarren.
  Francisco Gonzalez, currently president of the Urban
Development Fund, will replace Ciro Zaa as the new minister of
urban development. The Urban Development Fund will shortly come
under the Urban Development Ministry.
  One of the changes that surprised all the local political
observers took place in the Venezuelan Investment Fund,
responsible for the privatization process. Abdon Vivas Teran,
head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, has been replaced by
Carlos Bernardez, a former president of the Bank of Venezuela,
the oldest private bank in Venezuela.
  The chief of the Central Information Office also announced
that Alfredo Gruber will be the new president of the Venezuelan
Guayana Corporation, the most powerful state-run business group.
Gruber will replace Francisco Layrisse who, a few days ago,
announced that he wishes to return to private practice.
  The latest addition to the cabinet, announced today, has
been
the appointment of Pompeyo Marquez, currently a minister without
portfolio, as coordinator for the government's social programs.
The new members of the cabinet will be sworn in on Monday [30
May] and will start to work immediately, Alvarez said.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Apr (AFP) -- In a communique issued
today in Caracas by the Foreign Ministry, the Venezuelan
Government condemns for the Haitian Armed Forces for "the
massacre of 23 Haitians" in that country on Saturday. In the
communique, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry "deplores the
worsening of the Haitian crisis and deeply regrets this wave of
violence, intimidation, torture, disappearances, assassinations,
and illegal imprisonment of people linked to democratic
political and labor movements." After indicating the death of
the 23 Haitians "should be added to the list of other equally
condemnable events in recent months," the Venezuelan Foreign
Ministry states that there is "a systematic campaign by the
Haitian military sector to exterminate the Haitian Democratic
Movement and prevent a return to peace and institutional
normality."
  The Venezuelan Government calls on Latin American and
Caribbean countries "to join efforts to end the situation of
violence and terror." It reiterates its support for OAS and UN
efforts to restore institutional norms to Haiti.
  In conjunction with the United States, Canada, and France,
Venezuela forms part of the so-called "Friends of Haiti Group,"
which has tried to mediate the return of ousted President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide. Aristide took asylum in Venezuela for some
months after the military coup against him in September 1991.

  [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 6 Jun (PL) -- The rejection
of military intervention in Haiti as a solution to the political
crisis in that country appears to be a majority stand in Latin
America. Several Latin American foreign ministers unanimously
expressed their opposition to that possibility when they met
here yesterday with Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of
state, to discuss the Haitian situation. The Latin American
diplomats are visiting this city to attend the inauguration
today of the 24th OAS General Assembly. Interviewed before the
meeting with Talbott, the foreign ministers of Venezuela,
Bolivia, and Costa Rica recommended waiting for the applied
economic pressures to resolve the problem. "There are still
diplomatic, economic, and financial measures that can be
implemented before considering other more extreme actions,"
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo Villalobos noted.
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, whose
country, along with Canada, France, and the United States,
belongs to the so-called group of friends of the UN secretary
general, said with regard to the Haitian situation: "We oppose
military intervention." Meanwhile, Bolivian Foreign Minister
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga also said that he opposed any armed
actions, which he warned, could lead to cures that are worse
than the disease.
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has reiterated that he does not
reject a military option to "resolve the Haitian situation," a
policy that has even been opposed by leading U.S. Government
officials. Analysts assert that, in general, the Latin American
governments reject this possibility, as opposed to deposed
Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who, last week, asked
for a "surgical operation" to remove the military from power.
  Questioned by the local media, Talbott expressed confidence
that the OAS will reiterate the international position regarding
the crisis in Haiti, which has been subjected since the end of
May to a total economic blockade by the United Nations. Talbott
indicated that many measures have already been jointly
implemented and that he believes other measures will be
implemented in the coming days.

<F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 May (EFE) -- The illegal
appointment of Emile Jonassaint as Haitian president places the
Dominican Government in a new, truly uncomfortable position -- a
vantage point from which it has decided not to meddle in the
internal affairs of its neighboring country.
  Today, the Dominican Government distanced itself from
international criticism of the Haitian coupists for appointing
Jonassaint as the new Haitian president. The government declared
this was "an internal matter" and a new twist in a crisis the
Haitian people must resolve themselves.
  In statements to EFE, Dominican Foreign Minister Aristides
Taveras Guzman today said: "We understand the appointment... is
a move by the Haitian politicians, and, as a country that abides
by its government's policy, we respect the sovereignty and
integrity of the people."
  With the backing of the military that seized power in a
September 1991 coup, Supreme Court Magistrate Emile Jonassaint
assumed the presidency of Haiti on Wednesday, drawing criticism
from the international community and causing fears of armed
intervention from abroad.
  Aristides Guzman said: "Although we have endorsed OAS and UN
efforts to achieve the democratic transition of the (Haitian)
people, we have always stressed, in one way or another, that the
Haitians should be the sole protagonists in resolving their
problems."
  This position by the Dominican Government, according to what
Foreign Ministry officials admitted privately, reflects their
impotence in face of a Haitian crisis that has no good or
acceptable resolutions from a Dominican standpoint.
  The Dominican Republic is fated not to agree with but to
comply with UN and OAS sanctions against the Haitian military --
sanctions designed to return deposed President Jean Bertrand
Aristide to power. The Dominican Republic is hoping the crisis
will calmly die on its own, preferably by the end of the
constitutional term of the Haitian government-in-exile, which is
in February 1995.
  All current developments in the Haitian crisis are
threatening the Dominican Republic.
  Aristide was criticized because of his anti-Dominican
remarks
during the seven months he was in power. The military
government cannot be accepted, however, because of international
opposition, and the same is true for the illegal appointment of

  The economic embargo imposed by the United Nations and the
OAS has not resolved the problem and has discredited the
Dominican Armed Forces, which have been unable to prevent
smuggling across the border. The new embargo, which will be
implemented on 21 May, puts more responsibility on Dominican
surveillance and will require additional spending. The number
of Haitian exiles and refugees are increasing in the Dominican
Republic, while the Dominican Government is resisting pressure
to install refugee camps near the border. The Dominican
Republic also has been obliged to accept international
observers, who will arrive this week to oversee the fulfillment
of the embargo.
  All of these problems were outlined to EFE today by Deputy
Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral, who confirmed the
acceptance of international observers, but he reiterated that
"the embargo violates the Haitian people's human rights. He
also said the embargo harms the Dominican Republic in view of
international accusations of "alleged violations" and by the
flow of Haitians.
  Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Government dedicates
virtually 25 million pesos ($2 million) a month to maintaining
border security.
  All of these inconveniences have been heightened in the past
months by the campaign for the upcoming general elections, which
will be held this coming Monday in the Dominican Republic.
  U.S. diplomatic sources, who chose to remain anonymous,
confirmed to EFE that the Dominican Government "suggested" to
the United States that it refrain from making "any move" on
Haiti before the Dominican elections.
