   NutraSweet Co. said the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of its low-calorie sweetener, aspartame, in six more food-product areas. 

   The government approved the sweetener for use in yogurt-type products; flavored milk; aseptic beverages; ready-to-serve gelatin desserts; wine coolers, and dairy and non-dairy frozen desserts. 

   NutraSweet wouldn't estimate the amount of sales that the new product areas will generate for the company. 
Those products generated more than $6 billion in total U.S. sales last year, including frozen desserts with $3 billion and yogurt products with $1.15 billion, according to NutraSweet. 

   In 1987, NutraSweet, a Monsanto Co. unit, had sales of $722 million, compared with $711 million in 1986. 

   The company said it has been working with several of its customers, including Beatrice Co., Pfizer Inc., Canandaigua Wine Co. and Squirt &amp; Co., to develop products in these areas that will contain NutraSweet. 
Some of these products are expected to be in supermarkets in the near future, NutraSweet said. 

   Nearly 1,250 products world-wide contain NutraSweet's aspartame, and getting approval for as many products as possible is important for the company. 
Currently it is the world's largest and only U.S. producer of aspartame. 
Its U.S. patent expires in 1992. 

   Aspartame, which is marketed under the NutraSweet brand name, currently is used in powdered soft drinks and tea, milk-based drinks, toppings and desserts, and over-the-counter medications. 
In November 1986, the FDA approved the use of the sweetener in juice drinks, frozen desserts on a stick, tea beverages and breath mints. 

   NutraSweet said it has also requested FDA approval for use of aspartame in such products as hard candy and cough drops, syrups and topping, and baked goods and mixes.

   Two Boston researchers reported at a scientific conference here that aspartame, the generic name for the artificial sweetener NutraSweet, promoted seizures in a study of mice predisposed to seizures. 

   Richard Wurtman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, and Timothy Maher, a researcher at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, cautioned that the study doesn't necessarily apply to humans. 
Mr. Wurtman, a longtime questioner of aspartame's safety, currently is helping to conduct a study of the effects of aspartame on humans at risk for seizures. 

   NutraSweet, made by NutraSweet Co., a Monsanto Co. unit, is used as a sweetener in diet soft drinks and many foods. 
The company said there's nothing novel to Mr. Wurtman's charges, which the Boston scientist has made in the past. 

   NutraSweet said that before its product won Food and Drug Administration approval it gave normal mice ten times the aspartame dose Mr. Wurtman fed his mice, without any ill effects. 

   Definitive answers still are needed on any effects aspartame may have on seizure-prone individuals. 
NutraSweet said it is awaiting results from clinical trials currently being conducted on humans. 
In the past, the Epilepsy Foundation has said it hasn't seen any correlation between aspartame and seizures in epileptics. 

   In their experiments, the Boston researchers fed aspartame to mice that had been given drugs or other treatments to make them susceptible to epileptic-like seizures. 
They said 78% of the mice had seizures after an aspartame dose equivalent to that received by a human adult who drinks about 1.5 liters of aspartame sweetened diet soda. 
Only 50% of the mice not getting aspartame had seizures, they added. 

   The researchers stressed that their study "does not indicate that aspartame itself causes seizures," but rather that it "promotes seizures in animals that are already at risk."

<LEADPARA>  Industry plans to market new sugar substitutes to U.S. consumers during the
next few years have rekindled a debate about the potential health risks of
these artificial sweeteners.;    While heavy sugar consumption has been blamed
for contributing to tooth decay and possibly obesity, critics warn that some
of the alternatives are no bargain either.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DEBATE RESURFACES OVER SUGAR SUBSTITUTES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The health question is intensifying as manufacturers scramble to take
advantage of the upcoming expiration of Monsanto Co.'s exclusive right to
market aspartame in the United States. Aspartame is the key ingredient in
Monsanto's popular NutraSweet brand sweetener.;    Monsanto's 10-year patent
for aspartame runs out in December 1992, and competitors are lining up to
produce aspartame or alternative sweeteners that they claim are better tasting
or more versatile than NutraSweet.;    In addition, Monsanto is petitioning
the Food and Drug Administration to market aspartame sweetener in heated
products, an expansion beyond its use in table-top sweeteners, soft drinks,
whipped toppings and other cold foods.;    The Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group, criticizes many of the
sweetener entries in its new book, "Safe Food: Eating Wisely in a Risky
World.";    Monsanto vigorously defends the safety of aspartame and says it
was tested to the satisfaction of federal regulators. But critics question the
thoroughness of some of the research.;    Utah State University researchers,
for example, have found that aspartame caused irregularities in some brain
functions of laboratory mice, which they said could explain some of the
complaints associated with NutraSweet. They said consumers of NutraSweet
should not be alarmed by the test results. Instead, they called for more
study.;    Others have warned pregnant women to avoid aspartame because of
unknown consequences to fetuses.;    Concern over other brands;  Consumer
groups also expressed concern about acesulfame-K, approved by the FDA for
limited use in 1988 and now mixed with several flavors of Trident sugarless
gum. The sweetener, known as ACK, is manufactured by Hoechst Celanese Corp., a
German company with U.S. headquarters in Somerville, N.J.;    Hoechst Celanese
said the company has conducted tests thoroughly demonstrating the product's
safety.;    But Lefferts said a test on laboratory mice found ACK caused an
increase in the incidence of breast tumors, and another study showed an
increase in the incidence of lung tumors.;    Some of the most formidable
competition to NutraSweet may come from sucralose, an ingredient from Johnson
&amp; Johnson's McNeil Specialty Products division that may win FDA approval as
early as this year.;    'They are satisfied';  "We feel they are satisfied
sucralose is safe," said Nancy Walker, spokeswoman for the New Brunswick,
N.J., unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson.;    "Sucralose doesn't seem to cause cancer,
but it may cause other problems that would limit the number of foods in which
it could be used," said the CSPI book.;    Lefferts said more testing is
needed to address concerns over the effect of sucralose on the thymus gland,
which is important in the body's immune system.;    Lefferts said no problems
have been found with Alitame, a sweetener derived from protein for which
Pfizer Inc. does not expect FDA approval until at least the mid-1990s.;   
Abbott Laboratories and an industry group, the Calorie Control Council, are
petitioning the FDA to bring back cyclamate. The sweetener was banned in 1969
after tests showed that when combined with other chemicals the substance could
promote cancer.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>EC Slaps Anti-Dumping Duties On US, Japanese Aspartame Imports</HEAD>

   The European Community on Thursday
imposed penalties known as anti-dumping duties on U.S. and Japanese
imports of aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in soft drinks
and food.
   The EC Commission said NutraSweet Co., the U.S. exporter,
charged less than half in Europe for its product than in the United
States causing ``material injury'' to Holland Sweetener Co, the
EC's only aspartame maker.
   It imposed a duty of 27.55 European currency units, or about
$38, on each kilogram NutraSweet imports into the 12-nation EC and
of 29.95 ECUs or $41.30 on aspartame from Japan's Ajinomoto Co.
   The two companies jointly market aspartame in Europe through a
Swiss venture called NutraSweet AG. Jan Bergman, president of
NutraSweet AG, protested the anti-dumping duties as unwarranted and
unfair.
   ``This is the highest duty ever imposed by the commission on a
food product,'' he said in a statement. ``It will cause an
immediate and dramatic increase in the cost of aspartame to EC food
and beverage manufacturers.
   ``We are shocked,'' he said. ``We do not understand the basis
for the commission's determination and we will meet with members of
the commission at their earliest opportunity to clarify their
position and register our concern.''
   The duties stem from an EC investigation, begun in March 3, into
the prices NutraSweet and Ajinomoto charge in the EC after a
complaint by the Dutch rival.
   ``Although the EC producer increased its sales and market share
from nothing when it entered the market in 1988, it was faced by
price undercutting by the U.S. and Japanese exporters,'' the
Commission said in a statement.
   ``Unless measures were taken, the Community would be entirely
dependent on one source of supply, i.e. the imports from Japan and
the USA.''
   Holland Sweetener Co. General Manager Winfried Vermijs said
aspartame costs up to $70 a kilo in the EC and about $150 in the
United States.
   In a statement issued by his office in Maastricht, he welcomed
the EC duties as ``good news for the European but also the U.S.
food industry for the move by the Commission guarantees the
presence in the aspartame market of more than one supplier, now and
in the future.''
   The EC Commission acknowledged its duties will raise prices for
consumers but said it was in the EC's``general interest ... to
maintain the presence of a Community industry in this important
product.''
   NutraSweet Co., part of Monsanto's G.D. Searle division, has a
monopoly on aspartame in the United States where its patent on the
product expires in 1992. Dumping refers to the practice by
exporters of selling goods on foreign markets at unreasonably low
prices to gain a significant market share in those markets or sell
off excess production.
   The EC calculated the duty on Ajinomoto Co. based on
NutraSweet's prices ``as the Japanese exporter refused to provide
essential information on its domestic prices and costs.''
   Holland Sweetener Co. and NutraSweet are the biggest providers
of aspartame in the EC where annual consumption is about 1,000
tons, compared with 6,000 to 7,000 tons in the United States.
   Aspartame's sweetening power far exceeds that of sugar and has
made rapid inroads in recent years as an ingredient in light soft
drinks.

   MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands -- Holland Sweetener Co.,
hoping to lure U.S. artificial sweetener customers from
NutraSweet Co., says it won't make them identify the
ingredient on their products when the market opens to
competition later this year.
   NutraSweet's requirement that its logo be displayed on
customers' packages has irritated some food and soft-drink
companies. "We don't believe that the NutraSweet name on our
containers adds value for our consumers," said a spokesman
for the Pepsi unit of PepsiCo Inc., a major user of aspartame
in its diet beverages. "Obviously we're looking forward to
December," the spokesman added, referring to the Dec. 14
expiration of NutraSweet's patent.

   Major users expect the entry of Holland, and perhaps
others, into the U.S. market will drive down the price.
Industry sources estimate aspartame now costs about $55 a
pound in the U.S.
   Holland, a joint venture of chemical makers DSM N.V. of
Heerlen and Tosoh Corp. of Tokyo, said it will quadruple
capacity at its aspartame plant in Europe in preparation for
the opening of the U.S. market.
   Responding to Holland's announcement, NutraSweet, a unit
of Monsanto Co., said it welcomes competition and is
"confident that we will remain the sweetener supplier of
choice for food and beverage companies" in the U.S.
NutraSweet said it "will continue to be the low-cost producer
of aspartame."

   Hoechst Celanese Corp. received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use of the company's calorie-free sweetener in certain dry foods. 

   The approval won't immediately make the sweetener, generically named acesulfame-K, a competitor in the chief product categories of the other two synthetic sweeteners on the U.S. market, aspartame and saccharin. 
But the approval, which is the first in the U.S. for the Hoechst Celanese product, gives it a toehold in the $1 billion U.S. market for sugar substitutes. 

   Hoechst Celanese, a subsidiary of Hoechst AG of Frankfurt, West Germany, received approval of its sweetener as a table-top sugar substitute and as an ingredient in chewing gum, dry beverage mixes, instant coffee, instant tea, gelatins, puddings and non-dairy creamers. 

   The FDA deferred action on the company's request for approval of the sweetener, which has the trade name Sunette in the U.S., as an ingredient in confections including hard and soft candy. 

   Hoechst Celanese said it will also seek FDA approval for Sunette's use in baked goods and in liquids, such as soft drinks. 
Industry sources say that uses in liquids alone now account for about 70% of the U.S. market. 

   Hoechst Celanese describes Sunette as having a "clean, quickly perceptible, sweet taste that does not linger." 
The product already is on the market in 20 other countries and is used in such products as Weight Watchers' Yogurt Muesli in Switzerland and Coca-Cola Light in France. 

   Because the product isn't easily broken down by heat, the company calls it a natural for use in making baked goods and candies. 
In the U.S., it won't have to carry any warning labels under the approval given by the FDA. 

   "It could be real head-to-head competition," said Gordon McCullough, the general manager of PMC Specialties Group, which sells saccharin under the brand name Syncal. 
PMC is a unit of PMC Inc., a privately held company based in Sun Valley, Calif. 

   But NutraSweet Co., which sells U.S. market leader aspartame under the brand name of NutraSweet, quickly dismissed the new competition as having an aftertaste. 
"We feel it won't be a competitor, based on taste," said a spokeswoman for the company, which is a unit of St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. 

   She added that NutraSweet, which dominates the soft-drink market in the U.S., can now be made in another form to be used in baked goods and hard candy. 
Those uses, though, are still subject to FDA approval. 

   Hoechst Celanese didn't disclose international sales figures for its sweetener. 
But some analysts said the product hasn't hurt NutraSweet badly outside the U.S. 
"It's a very minor threat to NutraSweet's position with soft-drink makers," said James Wilbur, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Monsanto closed at $85.875, down $1.125. 

   The competition could grow keener if the FDA clears still other sweeteners it is now reviewing. 
Pfizer Inc. and McNeil Specialty Products Co., a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, are seeking approval for new sweeteners, and Abbott Laboratories has asked the FDA to reconsider cyclamate, which was removed from the market in 1970 because of health concerns.

   NutraSweet Co.'s six-year monopoly on the sale of aspartame in Canada ends today, after the Monsanto Co. unit lost its exclusive right to sell the non-sugar sweetener last week despite an attempt to get Parliament to extend the patent for five years. 

   The effort was blocked by a coalition of consumer groups and trade organizations, as well as by potential competitors that hope to get a piece of a business with estimated annual sales of 300 metric tons, or almost $30 million. 

   NutraSweet said it requested the extension because it hadn't been able to benefit from the full length of its patent. 
Though it received the patent in 1970, regulatory delays blocked sale of aspartame in Canada until 1981. 

   The change promises to open the door to a host of importers and manufacturers that hope to tap the Canadian market for aspartame, the only non-sugar sweetener permitted by the Health Protection Branch, a regulatory agency. 
Already, Toronto-based Semmons-Taylor Inc. has promised to begin importing Japanese aspartame by the end of this week. 
Synthetech Inc., a tiny Boulder, Colo., biotechnology concern, hopes to license an aspartame-making process in Canada. 
Soft-drink makers account for 90% of the Canadian aspartame business. 

   NutraSweet doesn't expect the change in Canada to affect its U.S. operations, which make up the bulk of its $711 million in annual aspartame sales. 
The company in 1983 received from Congress an extension of its U.S. patent, which expires in 1992, and still holds patents on its manufacturing process.

HOLLAND Sweetener Company (HSC), Europe's only producer of aspartame, a
low-calorie sweetener used mainly in soft drinks, plans to quadruple
production capacity in preparation for an assault on the US market, the
preserve of NutraSweet of the US.
HSC, a joint venture between Dutch chemicals group DSM and Tosoh of Japan,
is to invest more than Fl 100m (Dollars 55m) in expanding the production
capacity of its plant in Geleen, the Netherlands, from 500 tonnes to 2,000
tonnes a year by late 1993.
At the end of this year, NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Monsanto and the
world's leading supplier of aspartame, faces the expiry of restrictive
patents which have kept competitors out of its domestic market. The US
accounts for 80 per cent of the Dollars 1bn global market for aspartame, an
'intense sweetener' which is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
Mr Winfried Vermijs, president of HSC, said the Dutch-Japanese joint venture
expects to win between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the US aspartame
market within five years of the patents' expiry.
However, NutraSweet, together with Ajinomoto, its Japanese partner, is
reported to be planning to build an aspartame plant in France, bringing
greater competition to Europe, where HSC has managed to wrest a 30 per cent
market share away from NutraSweet in the four years since the joint venture
first began commercial production.
Mr Vermijs said the sharp rise in capacity would not lead to a surplus. 'The
world market is growing at 10 per cent a year,' he said.

   The Food and Drug Administration has
approved the use of the artifical sweetener aspartame in six new
food categories, the NutraSweet Co. announced Tuesday.
   Aspartame, marketed as NutraSweet, now may be used in yogurt-type
products, refrigerated flavored milk beverages, ready-to-serve fruit
juices, refrigerated ready-to-serve gelatin desserts, fruit wine
beverages and frozen desserts, the company said in a statement.
   ``I expect some of these products to be in stores and markets in
the near future,'' said Robert B. Shapiro, chairman and chief
executive officer of NutraSweet Co.
   Shapiro said the FDA approvals were ``another affirmation of the
increasingly important role of NutraSweet in the diets of
health-conscious consumers and their families.''
   He also said the company has been working with its customers
together to develop products in the new categories.
   Aspartame has been used in 1,250 products since it was first
approved in 1981 for chewing gum, the company said.
   NutraSweet Co., headquartered in this northern Chicago suburb, is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Monsanto Co.

   The artificial sweetener aspartame, known commercially as NutraSweet, helps at least some obese people stick to diets and shed pounds, according to a study by Harvard Medical School researchers. 

   The study contradicts results of previous aspartame research, but it isn't likely to end medical controversy about NutraSweet's value as a dieting aid. 
The controversy heated up last year when two British researchers at Leeds University reported a study in the medical journal Lancet indicating that ingesting aspartame can sometimes stimulate appetite and make successful dieting harder. 
The British study, in which 95 people took part, involved controlled consumption of aspartame doses over several hours. 

   By contrast, the recent Harvard study, funded by Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet unit, was the first to investigate aspartame's use in real-life diet situations. 
Conducted with 59 obese people in a 12-week weight-reduction program, it showed that women who consumed aspartame-containing foods, such as puddings and diet drinks, lost an average 16.5 pounds. 
That was about four more pounds than the average weight loss for women in the study whose diets didn't include sugar substitutes but contained the same number of calories. 
The aspartame group also reported having more energy and other indications of well-being compared with the other group. 

   The study showed, however, almost opposite weight-loss results for male participants, but the researchers emphasized that not enough men took part to yield statistically significant results. 

   "The aspartame allowed people to achieve mouth pleasure without adding calories, and that improved compliance with their diets," said George Blackburn, who led the study. 
"We think the protocol of the aspartame study is representative of a new generation of diets" in which "you don't have to suffer or be in pain to solve the disease of obesity." 
He added that both groups of dieters participating in its study consumed high-fiber, low-fat foods and took part in an exercise and behavior-modification program. 

   The Harvard researchers said their study was a preliminary investigation that will followed be by a longer one with more definitive results. 
Dr. Blackburn also said that the study doesn't indicate aspartame's value for dieters of normal weight. 

   Nutritionists hailed the Harvard study as a significant finding, but they cautioned that further research will be needed to resolve questions about NutraSweet and dieting. 
The Harvard study "is certainly significant, but it isn't the last word," said Judith Wurtman, a researcher who has studied aspartame at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
"Many people tend to crave carbohydrates and gain weight in the winter. 
One wonders whether an aspartame diet would have had the same results with those people when they crave carbohydrates the most."

developing a new substance it already is heralding as the
sugar replacement of the 21st century.
   Called Sweetener 2000, the ingredient has 10,000 times the
sweetness of sugar, making it perhaps the world's sweetest
chemical -- and literally zero calories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But don't look to reach for it in your sugar bowl anytime
soon. NutraSweet Co. isn't expected to seek Food and Drug
Administration approval for its ingredient before 1994.
Nonetheless, the Monsanto Co. unit believes that Sweetener
2000 offers a far broader opportunity than NutraSweet, which
is the world's most popular artificial sweetener.
   "It's targeted to replace sugar," said Michael L. Losee,
who heads NutraSweet's research-and-development department.
Says Robert E. Flynn, NutraSweet's chief executive officer:
"I jokingly tell Monsanto's board that if we do this, maybe
we could buy Monsanto."
   But NutraSweet could encounter stiff competition with its
new miracle ingredient. Already seeking Food and Drug
Administration approval are Johnson &amp; Johnson's sucralose,
which is 600 times sweeter than sugar, and Pfizer Inc.'s
alitame, which is 2,000 times sweeter. Coca-Cola Co. also
recently patented a class of sweeteners as much as 1,900
times sweeter than sugar, although it says it isn't currently
contemplating any commercial applications.
   The new sweetener can be used in baking and has an
indefinite shelf life. NutraSweet says its product also costs
less than one cent a pound to produce -- compared with many
times that for sugar.
   "We have changed the cost structure of sweeteners with
this," Mr. Losee says.
   By contrast, NutraSweet is only 200 times sweeter than
sugar; it breaks down at high temperatures and is far more
expensive than sugar. Although the company won't say what it
charges for NutraSweet, some analysts believe the sweetener
costs customers upwards of $50 a pound.
   NutraSweet officials wouldn't say if Sweetener 2000 will
eventually make NutraSweet obsolete or whether the two
sweeteners can coexist since NutraSweet is primarily a
diet-oriented ingredient.
   NutraSweet Co. is under the gun to score a big hit with
Sweetener 2000. The patent on its best-selling artifical
sweetener expires Dec. 14, 1992. After that, competitors will
be free to produce rival versions of aspartame, which
NutraSweet sells under the NutraSweet brand name. The biggest
use for NutraSweet, which holds 75% of the $1 billion
artificial sweetener market world-wide, is in soft drinks. It
also is used in about 3,000 other products.
   NutraSweet officials predict the company's nearly $1
billion in annual sales will decrease about $250 million in
the first year the patent expires. Competitors, now in the
wings, will force the company to lower its prices. Last year,
NutraSweet contributed 20% of parent Monsanto's $909 million
in pretax earnings.
   Already, some of NutraSweet's biggest customers eagerly
await the post-patent era. Over the years NutraSweet has
antagonized many of them because, in holding a classic
monopoly, it not only charged exorbitant prices but also
forced customers to use its distinctive red-and-white swirl
logo on their packaging.
   "If we were able to satisfy ourselves that by not doing
business with NutraSweet, we wouldn't lose any business, we
would make a change, based on our feelings at this point,"
says M. L. Lowenkron, chief executive officer of A&amp;W Brands
Inc., a White Plains, N.Y.-based soft-drink bottler.
   Undeterred, NutraSweet is beginning to inform its
customers of its new super-sweetener and plans to ply them
with samples in a cola formulation.
   The new sweetener is made of two related compounds -- aryl
ureas and trisubstitued guanidines. It was discovered about
two years ago by researchers at the Claude Bernard University
in Lyon, France, who hold its patent. NutraSweet has
exclusive licensing rights.
   But some industry experts question whether Sweetener 2000
might be too much of a good thing. Among other objections,
Mel Wolkstein, a consultant at Reach Associates Inc., warns
that the new sweetener is so concentrated that it "may be
difficult to control in end products."

<HL> Monsanto's NutraSweet Unit Is Seeking
Approval to Use Baked-Goods Sweetener

   NutraSweet Co., a unit of Monsanto Co., said it sought government clearance for a new technology that would allow its low-calorie aspartame sweetener to be used in baked goods. 

   If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the new method has the potential to greatly expand NutraSweet's current market and transform the $15 billion market for sweet baked goods. 
But industry sources cautioned that the baked-good version of NutraSweet could still face technical hurdles. 
Moreover, by the time it is introduced on the market, the product could run into competition from two other new low-calorie sweeteners that are making their way through the approval process. 

   Though NutraSweet-brand sweetener is now used in products ranging from diet soft drinks to laxatives, its susceptibility to heat has thus far prevented its use in baked goods. 
The company said it has developed a method of coating the sweetener with food-grade materials to protect it from high heat during baking. 
The capsules would release the sweetener at the end of the baking process. 

   If the method is approved, NutraSweet said it plans to immediately begin marketing the sweetener to food processors as a branded ingredient for use in commercially prepared baked goods and mixes. 
The company wouldn't speculate on the baked-goods sweetener's potential market, but industry sources said it isn't likely to match NutraSweet's sales to the diet soft drink industry. 
Sales to that industry accounted for most of the Skokie, Ill.-based company's $711 million in sales last year. 
Besides its sweeteners business, St. Louis-based Monsanto has interests in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and other products. 

   Nevertheless, if widely adopted, the technology could greatly expand both the market for NutraSweet and baked goods. 
The introduction of NutraSweet ignited sales of diet soft drinks and helped revive stagnating markets for powdered soft drinks and Jell-O. 

   But the company may still face technological hurdles before NutraSweet can be widely adopted in baked goods. 
Since NutraSweet is 180 times sweeter than sugar, users must find other methods to replace the volume sugar currently provides. 
Sugar also adds texture to baked goods. 

   "You just can't use a drop of NutraSweet in place of a cup of sugar," said an official at General Mills Inc. in Minneapolis. 

   NutraSweet said at least one "bulking agent" is already available, and it is currently working on others. 
Robert B. Shapiro, the company's chief executive officer, added that the market for the product will expand as better bulking agents are developed. 
The company said it won't market the baked-goods sweetener to consumers, since they don't have access to such ingredients. 

   By the time it is introduced, the new form of NutraSweet could also face competition from two other low-calorie sweeteners that are currently pending FDA approval -- Pfizer Inc.'s alitame and Johnson &amp; Johnson's sucralose. 
Pfizer has said alitame can be used in baking, and sucralose is said to be able to withstand higher temperatures than pure NutraSweet. 

   If NutraSweet's new technology wins quick approval, it will get a head start in that race, says William R. Young, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. 
But if approval drags on, the company "will be stuck winning back market share," he adds. 

   But even with FDA approval, the new technology doesn't mean calorie-free doughnuts are just around the corner. 
Many of the calories in baked goods come from starches, oils and other sources, the company said, so NutraSweet would only cut calories 30% to 50%.

   NutraSweet Co. announced plans Thursday to double
the production capacity for its artificial sweetener products, which
are marketed in more than 70 countries.
   The company, based in Deerfield, Ill., said its growth over the
past year has made it necessary to expand operations around the
world to meet future demand.
   ``In response to strong consumer demand in both U.S. and
international markets, we will virtually double our global capacity
over the next two years,'' NutraSweet Chairman Robert Shapiro said
in a statement.
   The subsidiary of Monsanto Co. manufactures and markets
NutraSweet worldwide and Equal tabletop sweetener in the United
States.
   By early 1990, the company plans to enlarge its U.S. plants and
open a facility currently under construction in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
officials said.
   During that same period, a partner company in Japan will also
increase its capacity.
   The sweetener is produced at facilities in University Park, Ill.,
and Augusta, Ga. The company also sells aspartame manufactured in a
European partnership with Ajinomoto Co. of Japan.
   NutraSweet spokesman Jim Prescot said the company intends to add
a new manufacturing facility at its Augusta, Ga., plant in 1991 and
also will invest in manufacturing sites in Europe.
   The low-calorie sweetener and popular sugar substitute, also
known as aspartame, is used in 3,000 products around the world,
including diet soft drinks, puddings and frozen desserts.

   NutraSweet Co. agreed to end exclusive contracts in Europe to supply aspartame to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. after a challenge under European Community competition rules. 

   Under the contracts, the two soft-drink concerns had agreed to buy the sweetener only from NutraSweet, a unit of Monsanto Co., for their world-wide operations until 1990. 

   An EC Commission said it began an investigation in 1986 after receiving a complaint from two companies that planned to produce aspartame in Europe. 
After negotiations, the commission said the disputed contracts were changed so that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola will buy from NutraSweet about half the amount previously purchased. 

   NutraSweet is the world's largest producer of aspartame, used mainly in low-calorie soft drinks. 
According to EC figures, the company controls 90% of the European market, where diet drinks rapidly are gaining popularity. 
The NutraSweet accords restricted other companies from entering the sector, the commission said. 

   A spokesman for Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo said: "Basically, we are satisfied with the resolution of the matter." 
Spokesmen for NutraSweet and Coca-Cola declined to comment.

<HL> Monsanto's NutraSweet Unit to Report It Has a Fat Substitute, Sources Say </HL>
<AUTHOR> Wendy L. Wall (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> MTC PG </CO>
<IN> FOD </IN>
<TEXT>
   NutraSweet Co. will announce next week that it has developed a low-calorie, low-cholesterol fat substitute, sources close to the company said. 

   The product, which will be unveiled at a press conference Jan. 27, is derived partially from milk proteins, a source said. 
NutraSweet, a Skokie, Ill.-based unit of Monsanto Co., refused to confirm that it has developed such a product, although it has said in the past it was working on one. 

   A fat substitute would give NutraSweet an important new product to complement its successful low-calorie sweetener, aspartame. 
NutraSweet's U.S. patent on aspartame, its only product, expires in 1992, and the company has been scrambling for new products. 
The fat substitute could also open new markets for the sweetener, a former executive said. 

   And it could throw the company into head-to-head competition with industry giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which is seeking regulatory approval for its own fat substitute, called olestra. 

   But NutraSweet's product could still be years away from the market. 
The company hasn't yet asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve its fat substitute. 
"The FDA tends to be extraordinarily careful on any food additive because of the immediate impact on the nation's whole food system," said Jay H. Freedman, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. 

   Nevertheless, rumors of such an announcement helped push Monsanto's stock higher late last week. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the St. Louis-based chemical and pharmaceutical giant slipped 37.5 cents a share, to close at $80.25. 

   And the potential market for the fat substitute is unclear. 
Such a product -- there are none now on the market -- could potentially be used in anything from cakes and cooking oils to salad dressing and potato chips, but specific uses hinge on properties that aren't yet known. 
For instance, if the additive breaks down at high temperatures -- as the company's NutraSweet brand sweetener initially did -- it couldn't be used in baked goods. 

   In any case, the product is likely to open new markets for NutraSweet's low-calorie sweetener, said Thomas Churchwell, a former vice president of sales who left the company last year. 
Currently, the sweetener can't be used in products like ice cream, because -- while it replaces the sweetness -- it doesn't replace the bulk and other chemical properties of sugar. 
Fat-based products that could be used to replace those properties also add calories. 

   Procter &amp; Gamble, which has been working on its fat substitute for more than two decades, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. 
But P&amp;G has said olestra is calorie-and-cholesterol-free, and tastes and behaves like any traditional fat. 
The substance is swallowed with a food, but not absorbed in the bloodstream. 
Some studies suggest it can bind with other fats in a product, and take additional calories and cholesterol out of a person's system. 

   Since olestra apparently passes through the body, some analysts and others have suggested that it may pose fewer health questions than a product like NutraSweet's aspartame sweetener, which is taken into the bloodstream. 
However, the FDA will have to determine that olestra doesn't deplete the body of important vitamins or, because of its lubricating properties, cause diarrhea or other digestive problems. 

   The FDA agreed to review P&amp;G's olestra petition last May, but analysts said yesterday it may be another two years before the product is approved. 
Unilever PLC has also said it is working on a fat substitute. 

   Use of all such products has a psychological element, and Mr. Churchwell said opinion is still divided on how successful they will be. 
"One theory is that (a low-calorie ice cream or baked good) is the dream," he said. 
"The other theory is that part of the reason you eat those things is that it's a little sinful."

   NutraSweet Co., a unit of Monsanto Co., said a federal
court in Wilmington, Del., partially dismissed challenges to
its patents on the sweetener aspartame.
   But NutraSweet said Judge Jane R. Roth ruled that certain
of the patent disputes raised in a 1989 lawsuit by Holland
Sweetener Co., a Netherlands concern, must be resolved in
court. A trial date hasn't been set.

   NutraSweet's various patents on the manufacture and
blending of its sweetening formula extend until at least
1996. The company markets its sweetener under the Nutrasweet
and Equal brand names. Friday's court decision dismissed the
charge in Holland's suit that Nutrasweet's patents have
already expired.
   Holland Sweetener filed suit against NutraSweet in 1989,
stating its intention to launch a competing brand in the U.S.
Holland is a joint venture of Dutch State Mines of the
Netherlands and Tosoh Corp., a Japanese industrial company.
   Monsanto is a St. Louis-based chemical concern.

   NutraSweet Allies
   With Mrs. Fields
   For Diet Food Line

   NutraSweet Co., seeking more ways to extend its sweetener
and diet food lines, said it will supply its Desserve foods
to Mrs. Fields Inc. in test markets.
   The agreement is NutraSweet's first effort to market
Desserve products -- mostly desserts, some of them making use
of aspartame sweetener -- through an alliance with another
widely known brand name. And it accelerates a new direction
for NutraSweet in marketing aspartame.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think what they're saying is that they've gone through
all the categories" in which aspartame was used as an
ingredient in packaged goods and beverages, said Frank Blod,
a consultant to the food industry at New England Consulting
Group, Westport, Conn. "This is a play to get into food
service."
   NutraSweet, a Deerfield, Ill.-based unit of Monsanto Co.,
St. Louis, has so far offered Desserve products only through
its own three Desserve cafes in the Chicago area.
   David Wilson, the Desserve project manager, said
NutraSweet will be looking for additional outlets for the
line, including the in-store bakery or other specialty
sections in grocery stores. "That's where you would probably
see it, rather than on the {packaged goods} shelf or in the
freezer case," he said.
   In Mrs. Fields, based in Park City, Utah, NutraSweet has
found an ally whose name became synonymous with
entrepreneurial success since Debra "Debbi" Fields began
selling cookies from a single store that has grown into a 500
plus-unit chain. Mrs. Fields, the company's founder and chief
executive, said the Desserve line will help her diversify
beyond cookies through Mrs. Fields Bakery Cafes. There are 20
such cafes to date.
   NutraSweet expects to supply two Mrs. Fields bakery cafes
in Chicago by year's end, and four others in San Francisco
early next year. The supplier agreement could quickly expand
if it works out in those test markets. In addition, the
companies expect to cooperate in product development.
   Some consultants noted that NutraSweet, whose namesake
ingredient is in some 3,000 products, will have to tread
carefully while marketing its own food products in order to
avoid antagonizing customers. "What they have to do is
wrestle with what this will mean for the ingredient
business," said David Braff, chief executive of consultants
Braff &amp; Co., New York, though he called the NutraSweet-Mrs.
Fields deal "a good symbiotic relationship."
   But Mr. Wilson of NutraSweet said the Desserve line will
largely be marketed through different distribution channels
and points of sale.
   In baked goods, the line could also move into a category
that products containing NutraSweet haven't filled, since the
ingredient as currently formulated breaks down under heat.
The company is seeking federal approval for a new formulation
that, it says, holds up well under heat.

<HL> NutraSweet's Fat Substitute, Seen Beating P&amp;G to Market, Promises Diet Revolution </HL>

   In a move that may help to revolutionize the American diet, NutraSweet Co. says it expects to begin selling a low-calorie, cholesterol-free fat substitute within the next 12 to 18 months. 

   The additive, which is called "Simplesse," will likely hit the market before Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s highly publicized Olestra, another fat substitute. 

   Although the two products are likely to compete in some food categories, Simplesse -- at least initially -- can be used in many products that Olestra can't and vice versa. 
Thus, the NutraSweet product represents a significant broadening of the way fat substitutes will be used. 

   Simplesse is designed to be used in ice cream, margarine, yogurt, processed cheese, salad dressing and a range of other products. 
It is made through a process that changes the size, shape and texture of milk and egg white proteins, says NutraSweet, a Monsanto Co.-unit based in Skokie, Ill. 

   NutraSweet says that Simplesse doesn't change the taste of food. 
But simply by having no taste, it may in fact, slightly change the way certain foods usually taste. 
"It has the feel of fat, but no taste of fat," says Jeanne Voltz, a cookbook author and former food editor who tasted chocolate ice cream made with Simplesse at a press conference in New York yesterday. 
"There was a taste that was missing and a very slight granular quality." 
Still, she adds, "it was a very good, acceptable product." 

   Simplesse has 1 1/3 calories per gram compared with nine calories for fat. 
Thus, a butter substitute made with the new product would have only eight calories per tablespoon vs. 36 for butter or margarine. 
An ounce of cheese made with Simplesse would have 36 calories compared with 82 for regular cheese. 

   "In a society that's looking for light things -- to have their cake and eat it too -- this sounds like a very attractive idea," says Dr. Irwin Rosenberg, head of the human nutrition center on aging at Tufts University. 
"This could have a very significant impact on the market." 

   The move also represents a marketing coup for NutraSweet, which also developed the low-calorie sweetener aspartame. 
Since Simplesse is made from natural ingredients, it doesn't require regulatory approval; P&amp;G's Olestra, a man-made compound, must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 

   The clearest drawback to Simplesse is that it can't be used for frying and baking. 
While Olestra is initially expected to be used in cooking oils and similar products, NutraSweet says heat would cause Simplesse to gel and lose its creaminess. 

   "If you put it on toast, it will spread like butter and melt like butter. 
But don't try to fry an egg in it," says Robert Shapiro, NutraSweet's chairman and chief executive officer. 
"We've taught a protein to fool the mouth. 
That doesn't mean it will fool the frying pan." 

   The only other known drawback is that people who are allergic to milk and egg whites could be allergic to Simplesse. 
The company says it isn't aware of any other health concerns. 
In fact, NutraSweet is expected to play up the product's "all-natural" source in its marketing campaign. 

   Simplesse is made through a patented heating and blending process that shapes proteins into balls so small that the tongue perceives them as fluid rather than individual particles. 
That process creates the smoothness, richness and creaminess normally associated with fat, the company says. 

   NutraSweet officials won't estimate the size of the market for Simplesse. 
However, they say retail sales of products in which Simplesse could be used total about $15 billion. 
The additive is expected to be sold at a premium to fat, one official says. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Monsanto's stock jumped $4.75 a share to $83.50. 

   Simplesse could also transform NutraSweet from an ingredient company into a food company in its own right. 
The company sold its aspartame sweetener under the brand name NutraSweet, a strategy that won it wide acclaim and propelled its sales to more than $700 million in fiscal 1986. 
By adopting a trademark name, NutraSweet is opening the way to a similar strategy with its fat substitute. 

   But Mr. Shapiro says the company may have a tougher sales job with Simplesse than it had with NutraSweet, since consumers had seen sugar-substitutes before. 
As a result, the company is considering bringing out its own line of food products containing Simplesse. 

   "Can we maximize the value of this by selling it as an ingredient -- in which case you risk it being a small brand attached to some other brand -- or should we market a brand ourselves?" asks Nick Rosa, the company's vice president of sales. 
NutraSweet could market products through joint ventures, licensing agreements or by making the products itself, Mr. Rosa says. 

   In any case, Simplesse is likely to open new markets for the company's low-calorie sweetener. 
Until now, aspartame couldn't be used in products like ice cream, because -- while it replaced the sweetness -- it didn't replace the bulk and other chemical properties of sugar. 
Simplesse replaces those properties without adding as many calories as fat.

Sweetner, Says 4th-Period Net Fell 24%

   Johnson &amp; Johnson said it sought government clearance to market a new artificial sweetener, and posted a 24% profit decline for the fourth quarter because of one-time charges. 

   The sweetener, sucralose, which the company has been testing for several years, eventually might compete against aspartame, the highly successful product sold by Monsanto Co. under the brand name NutraSweet. 

   But Johnson &amp; Johnson could face months or years of government safety reviews before the new product can be sold. 

   Sucralose is based on a sugar derivative that the company licensed from Tate &amp; Lyle PLC, a London-based sugar refiner. 
Sources familiar with the product say sucralose can withstand higher temperatures than can aspartame, and that might make its use in certain foods more desirable. 
A company spokesman declined to discuss the product. 

   Based largely on the news concerning the sweetener, Johnson &amp; Johnson shares jumped $3 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $80 each on volume of 1,024,000 shares. 
Monsanto stock fell 37.5 cents a share to $78. 

   Johnson &amp; Johnson said earnings fell 24% in the fourth quarter because of $45 million in charges related to the sale of its Technicare unit, which makes medical imaging devices. 
For the period, the company posted net income of $96.5 million, or 55 cents a share, down from $127.7 million, or 70 cents a share, the year earlier. 

   The Technicare-related write-down is in addition to the $170 million that was charged against earnings in the first quarter because of the unit's sale. 

   Without the most recent write-down, the quarter's earnings would have risen 11% to $141.5 million, or 82 cents a share. 

   Sales for the quarter increased 5.3% to $1.75 billion from $1.66 billion a year ago. 

   For the full year, Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings declined 46% because of the full-year charges of $380 million due to the Technicare write-down and costs associated with the company's withdrawal from the over-the-counter capsule business following incidents of tampering with its Tylenol pain reliever. 

   For the year, the company earned $329.5 million, or $1.85 a share, a 46% decline from $613.7 million, or $3.36 a share, in 1985. 
Sales for the year increased 9.1% to $7 billion from $6.42 billion in 1985. 
The company attributed half the sales increase to gains resulting from the weakness of the dollar against currencies of the countries in which the company does business. 

   A Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman said the company sought clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for the sucralose sweetener that the company says is 600 times sweeter than sugar, but is noncaloric. 
The spokesman said the company filed with the FDA following "comprehensive safety and taste" tests of what he described as a "high-intensity sweetener that is derived from sugar." 
The spokesman said the company won't comment further until later this month when the FDA is expected to rule on whether to accept its application. 

   Johnson &amp; Johnson investors have been awaiting word of the sweetener's progress for two years since word first leaked out that the company was testing a product. 
The company has been testing the product since 1981. 

   A spokesman at Monsanto's NutraSweet division said, "It would be premature to speculate as to the safety, taste, quality or cost of (sucralose), or as to when or whether it will become a commercial product." 
NutraSweet sales totaled more than $700 million last year.

<HL> Nutritionists Detect a Dark Side In New World of Food Substitutes </HL>
<AUTHOR> Robert Johnson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   A vision of the future: A customer enters a restaurant and orders a hamburger, french fries and chocolate milk shake. 
It tastes delicious and has practically no calories. 
The meal, nutritionists agree, does no great harm. 

   It also does no good. 

   That futuristic vision may not be too far off, as big food companies race to come up with new products that they promise will not only taste great, but also let all Americans have bodies like fashion models. 
Just last week, NutraSweet Co. announced a new fat substitute, Simplesse, which it hopes will clear regulatory approval and be on the market in the next year or two. 
Another fat substitute -- Procter &amp; Gamble's Olestra -- may not be far beyond. 
And Aspartame, the artificial sweetener sold by NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Monsanto Co., already commands a large market. 

   Increasingly, however, nutritionists are peering into the dark side of this promised revolution in the American diet. 
Nobody yet understands the full implications of these products. 
But nutritionists fear a world where diets of synthetic foods exacerbate our worst eating habits. 
And researchers caution that the long-term health effects of these new products are unknown. 

   "The food industry is developing synthetics and conquering nature," says Joan Gussow, professor of nutrition at Teachers College in New York. 
"We're severing our contact with nature and that's dangerous." 
Still, she says, it's a trend that's hard to fight. 
"We as a society have a lust for the taste of fat," she says. 

   It's a lust that is intense. 
Consumers want to satisfy their taste buds while cutting calories. 
Simplesse, for instance, has 1 1/3 calories per gram, compared with nine calories for fat. 
Thus, a butter substitute made with the new product would have only eight calories per tablespoon vs. 36 for butter or margarine. 
P&amp;G's Olestra wouldn't have any calories. 

   Moreover, many people are starting to expect science to cure the problems they cause for themselves at the dinner table. 
"We're all into popping a pill after we eat to stop the damage," says Bonnie Liebman, a nutritionist in Washington, D.C. 

   Little wonder, then, that food companies envision a synthetic-food market worth billions of dollars. 
They are holding their breath, hoping that the Food and Drug Administration doesn't find that any of the products produce side effects in lab testing on rats. 

   But even if the rats thrive, nutritionists have plenty of concerns. 

   The first is that it may kill much of the incentive people have for eating well. 
The inevitable intense marketing of the fat substitutes will focus consumer attention on such foods as ice cream, cookies and potato chips. 
If people think they can eat all they want of such foods with little risk, many are likely to skip their carrots and spinach, nutritionists say. 
Yet a proper diet consists of taking the appropriate vitamins and minerals, they say; it isn't what's left out. 

   "There's the hazard that in some people's minds, unhealthy foods will be transformed into healthy foods," says Kelly Brownell, co-director of the obesity clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. 
"It's going to hurt if people replace vegetable calories with ice cream calories," he says. 

   Adds Walter Mertz, an FDA nutritionist: "Let's say the good side of this stuff is it lowers cholesterol if used prudently. 
It may also make people forget their diets." 

   The effect may be even more harmful than that; it also may give people an excuse to further indulge in foods that aren't good for them. 
Nutritionists say that's partly because the fat substitutes won't eliminate people's desire for the normal amount of regular fat that their bodies are used to. 

   "The tongue can be fooled but the body still wants its calories," says Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group. 
"People who use the substitutes will say, 'Now I have eaten something healthy. 
I can loosen up.'" 

   As evidence, nutritionists point to the increase in sugar consumption as artificial sweeteners have been introduced. 
Per-capita consumption of sugar has risen 14% to 129.8 pounds since 1965. 
Meanwhile, artificial sweetener use has more than tripled. 

   Artificial sweeteners have merely sharpened the consumer's sweet tooth, some critics say. 
"I put aspartame in my coffee and then eat apple pie. 
A lot of us look forward to our diet drink and our ice cream on the side," says Yolanda Wesely, a sociologist in New York. 

   Researchers are also concerned that the new products may not only keep consumers from eating vitamin-enriched foods; the products actually may even flush vitamins out of the body. 

   David Hattan, chief of regulatory affairs for food at the FDA, says he is concerned about a fat substitute, now under testing, that isn't absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract. 
"Vitamins could be passed right out of the body without being absorbed," he says. 
"People could starve to death on this kind of material." 
Mr. Hattan adds that this wouldn't by itself necessarily ban the products, which aren't billing themselves as nutritional foods. 

   Mr. Hattan suggests that fat-soluble vitamins and minerals may be needed to supplement the fat substitutes. 
But he suspects at least one other problem. 
"As these (new fat substitutes) flow through the body, they may have laxative properties," he says. 

   FDA researchers say they don't know much yet about the long-term effects of fat substitutes mixing with medication and other substances. 
Typically, lab tests on food products are for the life cycle of rats or mice -- about four years. 
Researchers say they aren't sure such tests parallel human consumption of fat over longer periods. 
"We just don't know," says the FDA's Mr. Mertz. 
"With every new development, there are risks." 

   The steady increase in the number of food-substitute products also raises philosophical questions about the government's regulatory process. 
Nutritionists point out that such products have proliferated from margarine and salt to a group that allows people to eat meals that are synthetic from appetizer to dessert. 
They urge the FDA to look beyond safety to the overall impact on the nation's diet when deciding whether to approve a new product. 

   "Just because we can imitate fruit, should we?" says the Center for Science's Mr. Jacobson. 

   Some nutritionists even recommend establishing a national advisory panel on food that would also educate consumers about the new products and how they fit into a nutritional diet. 

   "Maybe a form of nutritional impact statement about each product is needed to assess whether it's a good thing," says Mr. Jacobson. 

   In the end, though, the nutritionists may be asking the impossible. 
They not only want people to stop eating bad foods; they actually want people to stop craving bad food. 
As Teachers College's Ms. Gussow says: "The thing to do about sweetness isn't find new forms of it; we need to decide that sweetness isn't the best taste in the world."

<HL> FDA Urges NutraSweet Co. to Submit New Fat Substitute for Review by Agency </HL>

<TEXT>
   NutraSweet Co.'s widely trumpeted unveiling of its new fat substitute turned sour as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strongly urged the company to submit the product for review, a development that is almost certain to delay its introduction. 

   At a meeting with NutraSweet officials yesterday afternoon, FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young gave the company three options for the new product, named Simplesse: submit it to the FDA for one of two types of agency reviews -- or put it on the market and risk FDA seizures. 

   The agency's move represents a serious miscalculation by NutraSweet, which unveiled the low-calorie, cholesterol-free fat substitute at a highly publicized news briefing Wednesday. 
At the briefing, the Monsanto Co. unit declared that because Simplesse was made of natural ingredients, it wouldn't require FDA approval. 

   But the introduction apparently caught the FDA off guard. 
The accompanying fanfare helped trigger the agency's action, Mr. Young said. 
"Usually, (developments that don't require FDA approval) aren't trumpeted. 
Here there were press conferences, tastings, a 110-trombone effect," he said. 
"If it's really just a cooking process, then there's no need for all this hoopla." 

   NutraSweet's claim that Simplesse wouldn't require FDA approval was widely seen as a major advantage of the product. 
Among other things, it meant NutraSweet could bring its fat substitute to market much faster than competing brands. 

   NutraSweet has said Simplesse is made from milk and egg-white proteins through a technical process that changes their physical -- but not their chemical -- properties. 
Thus, the company argued that Simplesse would fall under the category of foods "generally recognized as safe," which don't require a complete FDA review. 
Food technologists and food-law attorneys said yesterday that the product sounds like it belongs in that category. 

   Although companies can ask the agency to affirm that new products fall into that category, they generally aren't required to do so. 

   "There's lots of precedent for (the agency) not requiring FDA approval" in such cases, said Merrill Thompson, a Chicago attorney who represents food companies. 
He said problems may have developed because "this was handled in a way that blindsided or embarrassed the agency." 
Added Theodore Labuza, a professor of food science at the University of Minnesota: "This is a legal issue, rather than a toxicological one." 

   NutraSweet officials who attended the meeting couldn't be reached for comment. 
A NutraSweet spokesman said he had no immediate comment on the meeting. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Monsanto closed at $83.625 a share, up 12.5 cents. 

   Mr. Young said he urged the company to either allow the FDA to affirm that the product is "generally recognized as safe," or submit the food additive for a complete FDA review. 
Although NutraSweet could legally bring Simplesse to market without prior FDA approval, the agency could seize the product if it is concerned that it is unsafe, the commissioner said. 

   All three options pose serious problems for the company. 
One option, filing a GRAS petition, would likely be quickest -- taking anywhere from a few months to several years -- but would probably force the company to divulge trade secrets. 

   A complete review, a second option, could drag on for years. 
In fact, some experts speculated that the company shunned the FDA review process partly because of the 10-year battle it waged to get its aspartame sweetener approved. 

   NutraSweet could try to wage a public-relations battle, counting on the attention Simplesse has received to pressure the FDA into a quick approval of the product. 
"NutraSweet has been in the thick of it," says Mr. Labuza, referring to the company's protracted aspartame battle.

   Johnson &amp; Johnson said the Food and Drug Administration accepted for formal review its new artificial sweetener, sucralose. 

   The sweetener could eventually compete with Monsanto Co.'s highly successful aspartame, which is marketed as NutraSweet. 
An FDA spokesman said the agency's reviews of new food additives can take as long as several years. 
He declined to comment specifically on the sucralose review. 

   Johnson &amp; Johnson, a health-care products concern, said sucralose, which is based on a derivative of sugar, is "600 times sweeter" than sugar but has no calories and doesn't promote tooth decay. 
The sweetener is being jointly developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson and Tate &amp; Lyle PLC, a London-based sugar refiner. 

   Johnson &amp; Johnson said the product has undergone eight years of safety tests in the U.S. and Britain, using laboratory animals and human subjects. 
Those tests indicated that sucralose "is safe for human consumption," Johnson &amp; Johnson said. 

   Tests also indicated that sucralose is stable "even when stored over long periods or at elevated temperatures," the company said. 
That property could make it popular for use in food processing, a spokesman said. 

   Johnson &amp; Johnson said it plans to market the product through its McNeil Specialty Products unit. 

   A spokesman for St. Louis-based Monsanto's NutraSweet Co. unit said, "We've always known there would be competition, but we don't know that much about (Johnson &amp; Johnson's) product, and it's too early to tell" what effect, if any, it will have on Monsanto, a chemical, electronics and drug concern. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Johnson &amp; Johnson shares closed at $90.50, up 25 cents.

   A subsidiary of London-based Tate &amp; Lyle PLC, is expected
to announce as early as today that it has received approval
of the Canadian government to market a new calorie-free sugar
replacement called sucralose.
   The new sugar replacer, which will be sold world-wide
under the brand name Splenda, is three times sweeter than
best selling NutraSweet, and contains zero calories. The
substance is the only one of its type derived from common
table sugar. Also unlike NutraSweet, the brand name for
aspartame, sucralose can be used at high temperatures in
cooking and baking and has a longer shelf life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Redpath Specialty Products, the Tate &amp; Lyle
unit marketing the ingredient in Canada, refused to discuss
their plans for sucralose or to confirm that they have
received approval from Canadian regulators. But people
familiar with the new sweetener say the Health Protection
Branch of the Canadian government approved sucralose for use
in 13 different food and beverage categories.
   Food industry experts say sucralose represents one of the
most pressing threats now facing NutraSweet, which is made by
a unit of St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. "This is going to give
NutraSweet some real competition," said Mel Wolkstein,
president of Reach Associates, a consulting company based in
South Orange, N.J. "There's likely to be a price war
brewing."
   Sucralose is currently awaiting approval by the Food and
Drug Administration for sale in the U.S. Pending approval,
health care and consumer products giant Johnson &amp; Johnson
plans to produce and market the sugar replacement here under
a licensing agreement with Tate &amp; Lyle. "We're extremely
pleased that Canada has become the first nation to grant
marketing approval for sucralose," said a spokeswoman for
Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J.
   But officials at NutraSweet Co., based in Deerfield, Ill.,
shrug off the challenge. They note that while the patent on
NutraSweet in Canada expired in 1987, the company still
controls as much as 95% of the market.
   "NutraSweet has already faced competition in that market,"
said a NutraSweet spokeswoman. "The NutraSweet brand is
already well-established with consumers."

   Scientists relieved another headache afflicting NutraSweet low-calorie artificial sweetener. 

   A human experiment at Duke University found that NutraSweet, the Monsanto Co. brand name for aspartame sweetener, wasn't any more likely to cause headaches in people than a placebo. 

   The experiment was undertaken after the federal Centers for Disease Control reported it had received several hundred complaints of headaches among NutraSweet users following the sweetener's marketing in 1981. 

   The Duke experiment involved 40 volunteers who had complained to the manufacturer that they suffered headaches after consuming NutraSweet. 
The volunteers were hospitalized at the university's medical center in Durham, N.C., where their diets, health and blood chemistry could be monitored. 

   On the third day, each volunteer took a capsule three times during the day. 
Some received capsules containing an inert placebo, while others received identical capsules containing high doses of NutraSweet. 
A similar "challenge" was conducted on the fifth day, except that those who previously had received placebos were given capsules of NutraSweet and those who had earlier taken NutraSweet received placebos. 
Neither the volunteers nor the dispensers knew at the time which capsules were which. 

   Of the 40 volunteers, 26 complained of mild to moderate headaches after taking the capsules. 
Eight of these developed headaches only after taking NutraSweet but 12 developed headaches only after taking placebo capsules. 
The remaining six developed headaches after taking both kinds of capsules. 

   The experiment, reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, was funded by the federal National Institutes of Health and NutraSweet Co., a subsidiary of Monsanto, a St. Louis-based chemical and pharmaceutical concern. 

   Several controversies have surrounded NutraSweet since its marketing was begun, including the possibility of neurological problems in certain people, and whether it increases the appetites of obese people.

   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved a low-calorie fat substitute made from milk and egg-white
proteins for use in frozen desserts.
   The product, called Simplesse and described as an ``all
natural'' fat substitute, is manufactured by the NutraSweet Co. It
is designed to have the taste and texture of fat but with fewer
than half the calories.
   The first product to be made with Simplesse will be a frozen
dairy dessert called Simple Pleasures, which the company said has
the creamy taste of ice cream but with significantly reduced
calories and cholesterol.
   The FDA approved the company's petition to affirm that the food
additive is ``generally recognized as safe.''
   Simplesse is approved for use in frozen dessert products only.
The company would have to get further FDA approval to use it in
other foods, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   NutraSweet, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Monsanto Co., also
developed aspartame, the artificial sweetener marketed under the
name NutraSweet.
   The FDA approved Simplesse for use as a thickener or texturizer
in frozen dessert products. Simplesse contains proteins from egg
whites or milk, or a combination of both.
   Foods containing Simplesse will have to include the product on
their labels because some people are allergic to eggs or milk or
both, the FDA said.
   Simplesse has also been approved for marketing in West Germany,
the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands
and Luxembourg.
   The FDA is reviewing a petition from Kraft Inc. seeking approval
for the use in frozen desserts of a fat substitute made from egg
whites and milk proteins.
   Also under review is a petition from Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. which
wants to use a sucrose polyester called Olestra as a partial
subsitute for fats and oils in shortenings, salad oils and cooking
in the home and by the food service industry.
   Lisa Lefferts, staff scientist at the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, said the group has no safety concerns about
Simplesse. However, the group has recommended that the FDA monitor
the impact of products such as Simplesse on the American diet.
   ``Will we eat more and more double-dip ice creams and eat less
nutritious foods, or will they help us lower our fat intake? We
don't really know,'' Lefferts said.
   The company said Simple Pleasures will be introduced in
chocolate, strawberry, rum raisin, coffe, peach and toffee crunch,
and other flavors would be added later.
   As an example, the company said, Simple Pleasures Strawberry
contains 120 calories and one gram of fat per four-ounce serving,
compared with 250 calories and 15 grams of fat for the same amount
of a leading `superpremium'' brand.
   Monsanto's stock surged as word of the FDA approval circulated
on Wall Street, rising $4.37{ in early trading to $112.25 a share
on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Monsanto Taps NutraSweet's Shapiro

   Monsanto Co., in a broad reassignment of top managers,
plucked Robert B. Shapiro from its NutraSweet Co. unit to
head its big agricultural-products business.
   The move places Mr. Shapiro, who established a reputation
as a marketing whiz at NutraSweet, in the race for the
president's post at Monsanto when its current occupant, Earle
H. Harbison Jr., retires. Mr. Shapiro is 51 years old, and
Mr. Harbison is 61.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I thought this was a good opportunity to broaden the
background of Bob Shapiro," said Richard J. Mahoney,
Monsanto's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Mahoney, 56, also acknowledged that Mr. Shapiro is now
in the line of succession to the highest executive posts at
Monsanto, a diversified chemicals concern based in St. Louis.
But he added that there are other candidates and various
reasons for the management shuffle, which takes effect June
1.
   The other executive often named as in the running for the
president's post is Robert G. Potter, 51, the president of
Monsanto's core chemicals company. Under the new arrangement,
he and Mr. Shapiro both become corporate executive vice
presidents. Mr. Potter had been a corporate group vice
president.
   At the agricultural-chemicals business, Mr. Shapiro
succeeds Nicholas L. Reding, who will remain an executive
vice president but will have responsibility for programs in
environment, safety, health and manufacturing. Some
chemical-industry analysts observed that Mr. Reding's age,
55, may have weighed against him in succession issues if
Monsanto is planning who ultimately will take Mr. Mahoney's
place.
   Mr. Mahoney dismissed that speculation, noting that
Monsanto has recently taken strong stands on environmental
protection and that Mr. Reding, unlike his predecessor in the
top environmental job, will report directly to the chief
executive. "I wanted Reding on the environment, working very
closely with me," Mr. Mahoney said. "That's all there is to
say."
   As the new president of Monsanto Agricultural Co., Mr.
Shapiro will be running a business that last year earned $432
million pretax on sales of $1.72 billion. His jobs will
include protecting the company's big-selling Roundup
herbicide, which is beginning to go off patent in several
markets, and overseeing the market introduction of new crop
chemicals in the Monsanto pipeline.
   Mr. Shapiro, who of late has served on the advisory
committee of the agricultural company, will also have to
establish himself in the farm industry, where Mr. Reding has
strong ties. In recent years, "there has been a change for
the better at Monsanto as far as the customer is concerned,"
said Keith Boyer, president of Brayton Chemical Co., a
Burlington, Iowa, distributor of crop chemicals.
   A lawyer by training, Mr. Shapiro saw his star rise at the
NutraSweet unit, where he was chairman and chief executive.
He made a huge success of NutraSweet's aspartame sweetener,
managing to get food companies to pay a premium while
displaying the ingredient's logo on their own products. Last
year, NutraSweet had pretax profit of $180 million on sales
of $869 million, even after about a $170 million charge
related to patent values.
   "I'm glad to see Monsanto will reach anywhere for
management talent," said Leslie Ravitz, a chemical-industry
analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., arguing that Mr. Shapiro's
marketing savvy will serve him well in the competitive
crop-chemicals field. But at Anantha Raman &amp; Co., analyst Pat
O'Brien expressed surprise that Monsanto would pick someone
from a legal and consumer-products background to run a
farm-related business. "It's nothing short of phenomenal,"
she said.
   Succeeding Mr. Shapiro at NutraSweet will be Robert E.
Flynn, 56, currently chairman and chief executive of
Monsanto's Fisher Controls International Inc., a maker of
process-control valves and other equipment. That appointment
also raised some questions, since Mr. Flynn lacks
consumer-products experience outside his service on the
NutraSweet board.
   But Mr. Mahoney, the Monsanto chief executive, called Mr.
Flynn "a very well-rounded businessman" who will arrive at
NutraSweet during a period when it plans to rapidly expand
production capacity and shave costs. Mr. Flynn will also
oversee the protection of the aspartame franchise as it loses
patent protection in the U.S. in 1992 and early marketing of
NutraSweet's new Simplesse fat substitute.
   Larry W. Solley, 48, currently a group vice president at
Fisher, will succeed Mr. Flynn there.

   ST. LOUIS -- Inside its massive palace of research here,
Monsanto Co. is placing a billion-dollar bet on
biotechnology. From these laboratories eventually may come
such breakthrough products as tomato plants that engender
their own insecticides, potato plants "vaccinated" against
viruses and a hormone that makes pigs yield leaner pork.
   But Monsanto is getting a rocky reception for the first
product to come out of these labs. Last month, Wisconsin's
Gov. Tommy Thompson signed into law a one-year ban on
commercial use of BGH, a bovine growth hormone that boosts
cows' milk production, after an outcry from the very market
the company had hoped to tap -- dairy farmers. Some small
farmers feared the hormone would cause an oversupply of milk,
forcing prices down.

   As the brouhaha indicates, product introduction can be as
tortuous and time-consuming as product research -- a fact of
special note at Monsanto. The diversified chemicals company
spent most of the last decade stuffing its new-product
pipeline. "There has never been a time since I've been with
the company, when we've had this array of things coming,"
says Richard Mahoney, a 27-year Monsanto veteran and its
chief executive.
   The reckoning will come in the 1990s. Largely a
petrochemicals concern until a decade ago, the company is
increasingly vying in the drug and food markets, in which a
product can be destroyed by a promotional misstep or by
political or regulatory difficulties. Genetic engineering
ventures, in particular, typically spark passionate debates.
   Many believe Monsanto will manage to pull it off. Wall
Street analysts believe some of its new products could be
blockbusters. They forecast annual sales of $100 million to
$200 million for BGH, $300 million to $500 million for a new
fat substitute to be sold by Monsanto's NutraSweet Co., and
$500 million for an ulcer drug marketed by the G.D. Searle &amp;
Co. unit. Monsanto won't comment on the projections.
   But there have been some setbacks. Monsanto had expected
to be selling BGH in the U.S. by now, but sales so far are
limited to Czechoslovakia. NutraSweet is scrambling to get a
jump on some giant competitors that are about to follow it
into fake fats. And Searle, once praised by the Food and Drug
Administration for developing a life-saving ulcer drug,
recently had a spat with the agency over its advertising of
that drug, Cytotec.
   A sense of urgency pervades the company, whose mainstay
products face growing competition. Patents are running out on
its glyphosate herbicide, known as Roundup; on its aspartame
low-calorie sweetener, NutraSweet; and on an
anti-hypertension drug, Calan SR. Together, these compounds
account for about 20% of sales and about 40% of profit.
   Last year, Monsanto's profit rose 15% to $679 million.
Sales increased 4.7% to $8.68 billion. But first-quarter
profit was down 13%, a dip Monsanto attributed to a weaker
market for its plastics and to farmers' delayed purchases of
herbicides. The stock has been volatile in recent weeks. In
Big Board trading, it closed yesterday at $102.50, up $1.25.
   A closer look at three of Monsanto's most important new
products -- BGH, Simplesse fat substitute and Cytotec --
provides some insights about the often rough road to market.
                                                                                                       

   Bovine Growth Hormone
                                                                                                       

   Monsanto is counting on BGH to be the first to generate
some return on the more than $1 billion it has invested in
biotechnology. A protein like one cows produce naturally, BGH
is made by genetically engineered bacteria and then injected
twice a month. In farm trials, milk yields have shot up by
10% to 25%.
   But Wisconsin's move to ban BGH temporarily may embolden
farmers in other states who also fear a milk glut.
Wisconsin's suspension, in effect until June 1, 1991, has
triggered a one-year ban in Minnesota. Anti-BGH groups are
vowing to step up campaigns elsewhere. But a proposed ban
failed this week to get through the Vermont Legislature.
   How long the moves might delay sale of the hormone remains
unclear, since FDA marketing approval isn't expected until
next year anyway. FDA officials say milk from BGH-treated
cows is safe. But the bans could lead to other problems for
Monsanto.
   James Tobin, a BGH marketing manager for Monsanto,
acknowledges that opponents may press for other measures,
such as laws that would require milk from treated cows to be
labeled. That, Monsanto fears, could alarm consumers, who are
increasingly concerned about food safety.
   Mr. Tobin asserts that the bans could lead other farmers
eager to boost milk production to demand BGH. Clearly, there
are dairy farmers looking to use the hormone, although
surveys by the company and BGH opponents vary sharply.
Monsanto maintains that BGH won't bring about a sudden milk
glut, because it will gain use gradually. Because BGH offers
a quick return on investment, the company says, it won't
favor big farmers over small.
   But many small farmers, having endured wrenching changes
in the farm economy, remain leery. "This will devastate rural
communities and small farmers," asserts John Kinsman, a
farmer who has helped to spark the protest in Wisconsin.
   John Musick, who directs an anti-BGH group in Minnesota,
says he is hopeful opponents of the hormone will succeed --
if not in keeping it off the market, then in turning
consumers against it. A BGH scare "could be just like the
Alar situation," he says, referring to the scare last year
over a chemical used on apples. "Suddenly organically grown
apples were in demand."
   The FDA has approved the sale of milk from BGH trials.
However, some big grocery-store chains, including Kroger Co.,
have refused to sell the milk. The chains say they are trying
to size up consumer attitudes on the matter.
   Another genetically engineered new product is also
generating some controversy. Monsanto is conducting field
trials of cotton and soybean plants designed to resist its
Roundup herbicide, which generated sales of about $1 billion
last year. Such plants might greatly expand the market for
the herbicide; it now kills crops and weeds alike, so farmers
have to use it before crops break through the soil.
   But some environmental groups say herbicide-resistant
plants would keep farmers heavily dependent on chemicals.
They are seeking to have tax credits for this type of
research eliminated. Monsanto contends the continued use of
Roundup -- generally acknowledged to be one of the safer
herbicides -- and the introduction of Roundup-resistant crops
would mean less use of more-harmful herbicides.
   Selling Roundup-resistant crops would assure Monsanto of a
strong market for the herbicide, which has lost patent
protection in a few countries so far. It will lose such
protection in many many more starting in 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Simplesse
                                                                                                       

   Monsanto's NutraSweet Co. scored a coup in marketing its
aspartame sweetener. Among other things, it sold it to food
producers with the proviso that the ingredient's logo appear
on the final product, thus winning consumer loyalty for a
mere ingredient. The question now is whether the company can
pull off the same trick with its fat substitute, Simplesse.
   Monsanto's strategy: Introduce Simplesse, a blend of milk
and egg-white protein, in a food item that millions crave,
albeit guiltily because it is fattening: ice cream. Hence the
fat-free Simple Pleasures. In February, the FDA gave
NutraSweet approval to sell the frozen dessert, which the
company expects to get into grocers' freezers by summer.
   In the case of Simplesse, however, NutraSweet is taking
the unusual tactic of manufacturing the dessert itself,
rather than selling the fat substitute to food concerns.
NutraSweet's reasoning is that it wants to maintain control
over crucial decisions, such as flavors. Simple Pleasures
will come in six, including chocolate and rum raisin.
   Simplesse will face tough competition in the dairy case.
Even Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., a main distributor of
Simple Pleasures, has recently brought out a fat-free
dessert; Dreyer's ice cream is aimed at a lower-priced
market, however.
   Some marketing titans may soon be weighing into this food
fight with their own new products. Kraft General Foods Inc.,
a division of Philip Morris Cos., is seeking FDA approval for
a fake fat similar to Simplesse. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. wants
approval of one that is more versatile; its fake fat can be
used in hot and cold foods.
   An already heated contest for shelf space is likely to
sharpen. The ice cream buyer for Jewel Food Stores, a
Chicago-area chain, says of Simple Pleasures, "We're kind of
dragging our feet on it, because shelf space is so tight."
   NutraSweet is seeking FDA approvals to use Simplesse in
other foods, including mayonnaise, salad dressings, sour
cream, dips, margarine, butter, cheese. The company hasn't
ruled out making some of these foods itself.
   NutraSweet has had extraordinary success with aspartame,
now used in some 3,000 food and beverage items. Last year,
including the tabletop sweetener Equal, sales reached $869
million.
   Robert Shapiro, the company's chief executive, insists the
sweetener still has a bright future. Yet in countries where
aspartame has lost patent protection, the company has
preserved market share only through drastic price reductions.
In December 1991, patent protection ends in the the biggest
market, the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Cytotec
                                                                                                       

   Searle won high praise in regulatory circles last year
when it introduced its ulcer drug, Cytotec, in the U.S.
Recently, though, Searle ran afoul of the FDA -- over its
advertising.
   The FDA recently forced the drug maker to take out an
embarrassing ad in medical journals. It read, in part,
"Published To Correct a Previous Advertisement Which The Food
And Drug Administration Considered Misleading."
   The FDA said a previous Cytotec ad falsely suggested that
the drug could be used to treat a broader, typically younger,
group of patients than the agency had recommended. One of the
FDA's concerns: The earlier ad featured a photo of a woman
Searle said was 62. But the FDA thought the model looked too
youthful. Searle said it didn't intend to mislead.
   The flap suggests the difficulties of aggressively
marketing the drug. Purchased by Monsanto in 1985 for $2.75
billion, Searle has revived its research and development,
which had withered. The company intends to introduce over the
next decade a steady stream of new drugs, of which Cytotec is
the first. U.S. sales started strong, then hit a plateau. In
recent weeks, Searle says, sales have begun to climb again.
   Searle is seeking to carve out a unique role for Cytotec
amid such big-selling ulcer drugs as Glaxo Holdings PLC's
Zantac and SmithKline Beecham PLC's Tagamet. Cytotec is aimed
especially at arthritis patients who are on nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. Such patients often develop stomach
ulcers. Cytotec, a synthetic prostaglandin, is believed to
help protect the stomach lining.
   Cytotec sometimes has side effects, like abdominal cramps
and diarrhea, so doctors tend to be cautious in prescribing
it. Doctors sometimes advise patients to take only half a
tablet.
   Searle is trying to fine-tune Cytotec. It is seeking to
develop a sustained-release formulation that lessens side
effects. The company is performing other studies to determine
whether the drug could be used to treat other conditions.
Searle forecasts world-wide Cytotec sales this year between
$80 million and $90 million, up from $60 million last year.
   Meanwhile, the makers of Zantac and Tagamet are eyeing the
Cytotec market. Both are undertaking studies in an effort to
win regulatory approval for use in treating the same
condition.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Keeping us sweet in
the long run - NutraSweet's decision to sponsor the London marathon is part
of a broader strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, it seems odd that NutraSweet this week opted to sponsor the
annual London marathon. After all, the company - which makes low-calorie
sweeteners - has only ventured into sponsorship deals twice before, for
tennis in the US and ice-skating in Europe.
NutraSweet's European operation - with its headquarters in Switzerland  - is
a joint venture between the US company of the same name and Ajinomoto, the
Japanese life sciences company. It started marketing its product in the UK
in 1983. Ewan Currie, NutraSweet's marketing director in Europe, says the
marathon sponsorship deal is partly a public relations exercise to mark a
decade's trading in the UK.
But the drive to boost an already successful brand name is fuelled by
increased competition on the horizon; marketing strategy is coming to the
fore.
NutraSweet is the brand name given to a combination of two amino-acids
which, in contact with saliva, taste like sugar. Indeed NutraSweet claims
its formula tastes more like the real thing than saccharin, cyclamate or
other chemical low-calorie sugar substitutes.
First developed in 1965, NutraSweet gained US regulatory approval in 1981,
followed by UK approval in 1983. Since then the company, which in the US is
owned by Monsanto, the agri-chemical giant, has ballooned. Now sold in 90
countries, NutraSweet is poised to take advantage of opening doors in
leading European markets.
Currie bases his expansionary hopes on the experience in the UK; in 1991, 27
per cent of all soft drinks sold in the UK were low-cal, and NutraSweet's
share of that market is about 20 per cent.
In Europe, the average person annually consumes 25-85 litres of soft drinks;
in the US that figure is a huge 180 litres. Moreover, in the US 30 per cent
of all soft drinks are low-cal and NutraSweet supplies almost 100 per cent
of that market. The only other permitted sweetener in the US is saccharin,
but all products using saccharin are required by the Food and Drugs
Authority to carry a health warning.
In Europe, NutraSweet's upward path was blocked until this year; low-cal
soft drinks in Italy and Spain account for no more than 3 per cent of the
market. Regulatory approval - in France in 1988, Germany 1990, and in Italy
and Spain this year - is now opening the way for expansion.
In European markets where NutraSweet is available, it has proved popular,
and to meet growing demand, it intends building a factory at Gravelin in
France.
NutraSweet has become an international brand in just over a decade, with
Dollars 900m (Pounds 452m) annual turnover in 1991, Dollars 85m of that in
Europe. Market leaders in many countries now formulate products with 100 per
cent NutraSweet, including Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi and Schweppes slim-line
tonic.
But that growth has been fuelled not just by a successful product. A variety
of marketing strategies - including placing the NutraSweet logo on products
which use it as an ingredient - has boosted both its brand profile and that
of the main product. NutraSweet as an ingredient currently has its logo on
more than 2,000 products internationally.
Currie gives an example: 'We gave a test group a sample. We poured half a
can of Diet Coke in one glass and half of the same can in another and said
'here are two different versions of Diet Coke to try'. The result was that
56 per cent said they preferred the version with the NutraSweet logo, 39 per
cent chose the other, with no NutraSweet logo. Of course Diet Coke is a
tremendously powerful brand name but even with that we can make a
contribution to perception of the product.'
Thus Currie hopes that the Pounds 4m NutraSweet is spending on sponsoring
the London marathon for the next two years will boost his company's brand
profile and that of manufacturers which use it. NutraSweet spends Dollars
10m a year on pan-European advertising but backs that up with continuous
consumer research and samplings; the first UK television advertising
campaign, in 1985, was supported by samples sent out to 8m homes.
But NutraSweet is facing the prospect of increased competition. The US
patent on NutraSweet expires in December, and four other types of sweeteners
are awaiting US Food and Drug Administration approval - sucralose,
acesulfamine-K, alitame and cyclamate, with the likelihood that sucralose -
(by McNeil Speciality Products, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson) will gain
FDA approval first.
There are two technological means by which NutraSweet could face down the
competition.
One is the technologically tricky problem of finding an effective bulking
agent to use in chocolate and confectionery. Removing sugar from
confectionery removes not just calories but also bulk.
A less intractable area concerns baking. Manufacturers of baked products
looking for low-cal ingredients to replace sugar find that baking separates
NutraSweet's amino-acids, defeating the chemistry which lies behind its
success.
Although NutraSweet is now developing NutraSweet 2000, which Currie promises
will be up to 20,000 times sweeter than sugar (against NutraSweet's 180
times) and will not break down during baking, it needs to capitalise on its
brand name while the competition gathers pace. Marketing initiatives - like
the London marathon - are part of its strategy to stay ahead of the pack.

FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: US halts production of Tate's sweetener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR Sucralose, a calorie-free sweetener developed by Tate &amp; Lyle, have
been further deflated by news that production has been halted in the US,
pending regulatory approval.
The US is estimated to account for 85 per cent of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) a year world market for high intensity sweeteners, led by NutraSweet
from Monsanto, the US chemicals group.
But although Tate and its US partner Johnson &amp; Johnson have spent Pounds
150m in more than 15 years of development, the product is so far only on
sale in Canada, where it gained approval a year ago.
As stocks have piled high enough to satisfy Canadian demand 'for the
foreseeable future' - which one analyst calculated to be four years - two US
plants have been mothballed by J&amp;J. The product is described as 'highly
stable' and so is not expected to go stale.
J&amp;J submitted an application to the US Food and Drugs Administration in
February 1987. The FDA would only say yesterday that the petition was still
under review.
J&amp;J said the length of time taken was 'not really unusual.' Aspartame, the
NutraSweet ingredient, took 10 years.
UK analysts were not expecting Sucralose to contribute yet to Tate's
profits. But some recently downgraded estimates for the year just ended by
about Pounds 8m, to less than Pounds 190m pre-tax, to allow for the
write-off of previously capitalised development spending.
Mr Mark Lynch, at SG Warburg, said the delay in gaining FDA approval did
cause concern in terms of Tate's medium-term earnings prospects.
One analyst said there had been a time when it seemed Sucralose and the fat
substitute Stellar, launched last year, might become star products, like the
blockbuster drugs that help the ratings of pharmaceutical companies.
However, they now seemed insignificant alongside the factors affecting the
main sugar businesses.

   WASHINGTON -- The unprecedented truth-in-labeling changes
announced last month by the government will trigger much more
than a massive relabeling of food products. One of the
foremost -- but unheralded -- objectives of the changes is to
spur the food industry into developing more healthful
products.
   And by all accounts, the industry is prepared to do just
that. The first of thousands of new edibles -- lower in fat,
sodium and other undesirable nutrients than ever before --
will show up on supermarket shelves by 1993 as food
manufacturers adapt to a new era of mandatory nutrition
labeling and strict rules for making health claims.

   "Until now, marketers have been relatively free to tinker
with words on the food label -- without altering what's in
the package," says Food and Drug Administration Commissioner
David Kessler. He and other regulators are counting on the
new labeling regulations to help shift the industry's
creative efforts from the marketing executive's "word
processor to the laboratory," as Dr. Kessler puts it.
   The joint FDA-Agriculture Department labeling initiative
will require "a tremendous reformulation" by the May 1993
compliance deadline, says Eric Larson, packaged-foods analyst
for First Boston Corp. in Chicago. "For the first year, you
will see a lot of companies trying to make their products
comply. Product innovation will come in a second wave." He
expects many of the new foods to be concocted with
proprietary ingredients, including fat substitutes and
artificial sweeteners, many of which are awaiting FDA
clearance.
   The consensus is that cutting fat will be the primary
research-and-development focus. "We are going to see attempts
to get the fat content down, and then see attempts to develop
better products with no fat," says Alan Hugunin, director of
product development at the National Food Processors
Association laboratory in Dublin, Calif. The new federal
rules also will remove various disincentives for developing
and marketing healthier versions of so-called standardized
foods.
   The $280 billion food industry has been in regulatory
limbo for months, waiting for FDA and Agriculture Department
officials to decide on scores of labeling rules that, though
seemingly picayune, will have vast potential to help -- or
hurt -- corporate bottom lines. Many companies have been
holding off on new-product research and development, pending
the issuance of final rules next November.
   But a new survey by Prepared Foods, a trade publication,
portends an industrywide rise in the development of more
healthful products. Of 421 food companies polled, 71% said
they plan to pour more dollars into new reduced-fat and
reduced-calorie products as well as diet foods for weight
watchers, according to the survey, which will be published
next month.
   Daniel Best, technical director of the Chicago-based
publication, says he expects the wave of new products to come
after companies have relabeled and reformulated existing
products. Meantime, manufacturers of ingredients such as salt
enhancers and fat replacers, including novel starches and soy
proteins, are complaining about slow sales due to regulatory
uncertainties.
   "There's tremendous demand for them building," says Mr.
Best. "I think you will see an upsurge of ingredient sales
once the companies know what the regulations are." Such
sales, he adds, will serve as the "leading indicator" of
innovation-and new-product launches.
   The marketplace has seen a steady rise in new products
bearing health-related marketing claims such as "lite" and
"no cholesterol." Last year, 10,301 new items were
introduced, up from 9,192 in 1989 and 8,183 in 1988,
according to Gorman's New Product News. Many of the claims,
however, have proved to be misleading, irrelevant or
fictitious, prompting enforcement actions by the FDA and
attorneys general from several states.
   Management at Kraft General Foods Inc., the nation's
largest food company, believes the new federal labeling
regulations will "encourage both good communication and
product innovation." Says Michael Mudd, spokesman for the
Philip Morris Cos. unit: "If companies want to use {health}
claims, they are going have to develop products that merit
them."
   But the anticipated cornucopia of more healthful food
choices isn't likely to meet expectations unless the FDA
speeds the approval of new food additives and ingredients.
   The agency has 400 petitions under review, including scads
of artificial sweeteners, some of which have been pending for
five to 10 years. Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet Co. unit, for
example, wants to use its aspartame product in everything
from breakfast cereals to hard candy, while Stroh Brewery Co.
wants to sweeten malt beverages with aspartame. Hoechst AG's
Hoechst Celanese Corp. unit is seeking FDA clearance to use
its sweetener Sunette in beverages and baked goods.
   Several fat substitutes are also under FDA review as
companies vie for position in the battle for the dieter's
palate. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has been waiting since 1987 for
the go-ahead to market Olestra, a synthetic concoction of
fatty acids and sugar that has the taste and texture of fat
but no calories. The backlog includes a Kraft General Foods
fat substitute, made from milk and egg-white protein.
   "We need a better response time," says Mr. Hugunin. "The
FDA has to be very cautious about what it approves, but it
seems like it drags out forever."
   The FDA blames the backlog on complex petitions and the
need to ask companies for additional food-safety data. "None
of us are happy with the time it takes," says Alan Rulis, the
agency's director of food and color additives. A management
consultant is being hired to study how the review process can
be streamlined without compromising public health.
   The agency, meanwhile, is moving to eliminate another
major obstacle to innovation. By next November, the industry
will no longer be fettered by archaic "standards of identity"
that hamper the marketing of lower-fat products. Currently,
cheddar cheese, for example, must be called something other
than cheese if it contains less than 50% fat. And butter
isn't butter unless it's at least 80% fat.
   "Who wants to make a big investment {in product
development} just to call something `artificial' or
`imitation'?" asks Sherwin Gardner, senior vice president,
science and technology, for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America.
   As part of the nutrition-labeling initiative, the FDA
intends to spare manufacturers from having to petition for
changes in a standard or having to obtain a series of
temporary exemptions in order to market a low-fat
standardized food.
   "This is a breakthrough," says Allen Rosenfeld, spokesman
for Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer
group. "It removes a huge disincentive to innovation."

<HEAD>Nutrasweet Loses Bid To Trademark Blue Packets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NutraSweet Co. officials were singing the blues
Wednesday about a federal appeals court decision that the pastel
blue color of the company's Equal brand sweetener packets is not a
trademark.
   NutraSweet, based in north suburban Deerfield, went to court in
February 1989 seeking to halt Stadt Corp. and Cumberland Packing
Corp.'s use of blue packets for their low-calorie Sweet One brand
sweetener.
   The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
denied NutraSweet's motion for an injunction in the fall of 1989.
NutraSweet, a division of Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, appealed the
case to the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the
lower court ruling in a decision issued earlier this month.
   NutraSweet spokesman Rich Nelson said the company is considering
appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We believe the use of color alone can be used as a tredemark,
just as other courts have found,'' Nelson said Wednesday.
   NutraSweet's lawsuit contended that the blue packets in which it
has packaged Equal since 1982 distinguish the aspartame sweetener
from other sugar substitutes such as Sweet 'N Low, which comes in
pink packets, and Sugar Twin, which is packaged in yellow.
   NutraSweet conceded the Sweet One's packets are not the same
shade of blue as Equal's, but said the color is ``confusingly
similar'' to Equal's.
   NutraSweet based its argument mainly on a 1985 federal appeals
court ruling from another circuit in a case involving Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corp., maker of pink fiberglass insulation. In that case,
the court established a limited rule that in certain situations a
particular color could be registered as a trademark.
   In the NutraSweet decision, Senior District Judge John W.
Reynolds wrote that the general rule prohibiting registration of
color as a trademark ``should continue to be the law in this
circuit,'' partly because changing the law would result in
infringement actions ``that could soon degenerate into questions of
shade confusion'' similar to the NutraSweet case.
   ``How different do the colors have to be?'' Reynolds wrote.
``Under NutraSweet's proposed test, the only way to answer that
question is through litigation.''
   Officials of Stadt and Cumberland could not be reached Wednesday
for comment.

<HEAD>FDA Says Banned Artificial Sweetener May Make Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The artificial sweetener cyclamate may find
its way back on the market after being banned for 20 years as a
suspected carcinogen, but probably not before next year, the Food
and Drug Administration says.
   The FDA said Tuesday it is continuing a review of the sweetener,
commenting in response to a Washington Post story that quoted an
FDA official as saying the agency ``made a mistake'' in banning
cyclamate.
   The agency has been considering lifting the cyclamate ban since
1982, and though studies have challenged initial claims that the
sweetener causes bladder cancer, other safety concerns remain.
   ``The final studies aren't expected until summer and fall, and
then the FDA would have to review that data and there would have to
be some time for public comment, so it may be hard to get all that
completed this year, and that's assuming the studies are
favorable,'' said FDA spokesman Bill Grigg.
   Among the concerns are cyclamate's effects on blood pressure and
whether it causes genetic damage, testicular atrophy or promotes
tumor growth.
   The Post quoted Robert Scheuplein, acting director of the office
of toxicological services for the FDA's Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition, as saying: ``I have no reluctance in saying that
with cyclamate we made a mistake.''
   Calls seeking comment from Scheuplein were referred to the FDA's
press office, and spokesman Emil Corwin said no interviews would be
granted.
   Grigg declined to comment directly on Scheuplein's remark, but
noted the FDA ``said as far back as 1973 that if the larger (base
of) data showed that the early data on which we based the decision
(to ban cyclamate) were faulty, that we would reverse it.''
   Scheuplein's comment was encouraging to the Calorie Control
Council, an industry group representing soft drink and dietetic
food manufacturers that has been seeking to reintroduce cyclamate.
   ``We look forward to reapproval as soon as possible,'' said
council spokesman Keith Keeney.
   The council and Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, Ill., the
major producer of cyclamate, in 1982 filed the latest of many
petitions to the FDA for reconsideration of the ban.
   Cyclamate was first used in foods and beverages in the early
1950s, before enactment of a law later that decade requiring
pre-market review of food additives. It was banned in 1969, and the
FDA reaffirmed that ban in 1976 and 1980.
   The FDA's Cancer Assessment Committee concluded in 1985 that
cyclamate does not by itself cause cancer. In a report later that
year, the National Academy of Sciences said cyclamate does not
cause cancer but may play a secondary role that should be examined
more closely.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest took issue with
the findings of the reports. Spokeswoman Lisa Lefferts said ``I'm
not sure the jury's in on cancer,'' and the center has further
concerns about the possibility that cyclamate causes testicular
atrophy, inhibits growth and damages chromosomes.
   ``We don't think FDA is likely to reverse its decision on
cyclamate. If they do they're going to have to make a lot of
evidence disappear,'' Lefferts said.
   The most common non-sugar sweeteners used in the United States
are aspartame, or Nutrasweet, and saccharin. The FDA proposed to
ban saccharin in 1977 because it is suspected of causing cancer,
but Congress has allowed it to continue on the market with a
cancer-related warning label.
   The FDA last year approved acesulfame potassium, or Sunette, as
a calorie-free sweetener for table use, and for chewing gum, dry
beverage mixes, instant coffee and tea, gelatins, puddings and
non-dairy creamers.

   Marketing:

   Concocting
   Big Changes

   ATLANTA -- Big changes are bubbling at Coca-Cola USA,
moves that are likely to shake up the company's marketing
efforts and ripple through the soft-drink industry.
   According to soft-drink industry executives familiar with
Coca-Cola Co.'s domestic division, in the past few weeks the
company has:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Chosen Theodore J. Host, president of Boyle-Midway
Household Products Inc., as its senior marketing executive,
filling a two-year vacancy in one of the most coveted
marketing jobs around;
   -- Expanded the consulting role of Sergio Zyman, an
ex-marketing executive at Coke who left under a cloud after
the New Coke fiasco and whose abrasive style won him the
title "the Aya-Cola";
   -- Decided to dim the spotlight on celebrity commercials,
which both Coke and Pepsi have relied on extensively in
recent campaigns.
   The changes, say the sources, don't reflect any massive
problems with Coke's domestic promotions or advertising.
Rather, they signal an attempt to revive some campaigns that
have been slipping into mediocrity.
   The company's latest Diet Coke campaign, for example,
featured little more than a parade of actresses and athletes
who bad-mouthed Pepsi -- not an effort that stacks up against
the company's successful jingles and sentimental ads of the
past.
   The most significant move is the appointment of Mr. Host,
who is expected to join the company early next month.
American Home Products Corp. agreed last month to sell its
Boyle-Midway division for $1.25 billion to Reckitt &amp; Colman
PLC, a London consumer products maker. Boyle-Midway brands
include Woolite, Black Flag and Easy Off. Mr. Host was also
an executive with American Home's food division, which makes
Chef Boyardee, among other things.
   The choice of Mr. Host was a surprise to industry
executives. Mr. Host didn't return repeated phone calls. Coke
would neither confirm nor deny the appointment.
   A Coca-Cola spokesman denied that there has been any
change in the company's plans for celebrity endorsements.
"The use of celebrities is still a viable part of the
marketing mix," he said. And regarding Mr. Zyman's role, the
spokesman said it would be "inappropriate to characterize his
work as more involved."
   The appointment of Mr. Host could be the most significant
in years for Coca-Cola USA. Mr. Host might be groomed to
succeed Ira C. Herbert, the 62-year-old president of
Coca-Cola USA, industry observers believe. But others note
that there is stiff competition for the position on the
inside.
   In the U.S., Mr. Herbert is Mr. Coke. Long before he
assumed the top job at the soft-drink giant's domestic unit
in October 1988, he helped pioneer the first national
television soft-drink commercials and devise memorable
advertising campaigns such as "It's the Real Thing," and "I'd
Like to Buy the World a Coke."
   In some advertising circles, Mr. Herbert is described as
Coke's "keeper of the trademark." The sometimes
quick-tempered executive personally approves every commercial
and ad theme. He has even checked the placement and size of
the Coca-Cola logo on grocery store coupons.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Host would eventually be
expected to fill both roles, president and senior marketing
executive, as Mr. Herbert has. Some in the industry speculate
that, if Mr. Host succeeds Mr. Herbert as president in a
couple of years, Michael Beindorff, the 38-year-old vice
president and director of marketing planning, could then
become Coke's senior marketing executive.
   Mr. Beindorff has been a shining star at Coke. He is
credited with the unusually aggressive "Move is on" Diet Coke
campaign, begun last year, which for the first time
positioned a diet soda against a sugared one, namely Pepsi.
He also was a force behind the much ballyhooed
three-dimensional TV spot that kicked off the Diet Coke
campaign.
   Although going outside for such a visible, senior post is
unusual for Coke, it is clear the company has been studying
outsiders for some time. About two years ago, Coke courted
Mark Goldston, then the president of Faberge Inc.'s Faberge
U.S.A. division. But Mr. Goldston ended up taking a marketing
job at Reebok International Ltd., a post he has since left.
   Coke was in no hurry to fill the job. Mr. Herbert, a
marketing heavyweight in his own right, hardly needed to be
propped up by a skilled underling. The last person to hold
the position of senior vice president for marketing was John
C. Reid, who moved into a planning post in 1988 following a
corporate reorganization. Mr. Reid has since taken a job with
Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson.
   Mr. Reid's tenure was fairly smooth compared with the
turbulent regime of his predecessor, Mr. Zyman, who helped
engineer the introduction of New Coke five years ago. When
Mr. Zyman left Coke in 1986, some people believed he was
forced out (although he and Coke then denied it) because his
abrasive style irritated Coca-Cola bottlers. Speculation
lingers that he was in some way a fall guy for New Coke. Mr.
Zyman was one of a small group of Coca-Cola executives
involved with New Coke.
   Still, Mr. Zyman, now a consultant, has done advisory work
for Coke in recent years with Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the
big Coca-Cola bottling unit, and Coke's fountain division,
whose business has been listing lately because of softness in
the fast-food industry. Mr. Zyman has a reputation as a tough
but brilliant marketer. Mr. Zyman didn't return calls.
   Industry executives say Mr. Zyman has been taking a bigger
role in other areas at the company. They say he has been
particularly active with Diet Coke, one of the company's
fastest-growing products, which he helped pioneer in the
early 1980s. He appears to be consulting on the implications
of the 1992 expiration of Monsanto Co.'s patent on aspartame,
a low-calorie sweetener. Diet Coke is one of the biggest
customers for aspartame, which is marketed under the name
NutraSweet. The patent expiration could lead to lower
aspartame costs and higher profit margins for Diet Coke.
   Mr. Zyman, industry executives say, is also helping tinker
with Diet Coke's advertising, the most recent of which has
drawn criticism for using a spate of celebrities: Jerry Hall,
Chris Evert, Phylicia Rashad, Vanna White, and Sugar Ray
Leonard. Last year, Coke and Diet Coke spots featured 27
stars. Pepsi, too, has featured a string of stars over the
years.
   Despite the company's denial, industry executives say the
word has come down from officials high in the Coca-Cola tower
in Atlanta that the star wars are over. Although there
apparently is no all-out ban on celebrity ads, simple
endorsement spots are being discouraged, the industry
executives say. The company is favoring more creative
commercials -- something along the lines of Coke's recent ads
featuring Art Carney as a lovable grandfather.
   That push is likely to draw a counter-response from Pepsi.
Traditionally the two rivals react to changes in each others'
advertising. When Diet Coke ads attacked Pepsi last year --
suggesting that consumers were leaving Pepsi in droves for
Diet Coke-Pepsi fired back, challenging the claim with an ad
that poked fun at Coke's researchers. And whatever maneuvers
the big soda pop companies make, the changes inevitably cause
waves that affect the strategies of the smaller companies as
well.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Artificial Sweetener</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is allowing
use of a no-calorie sweetener as a table sugar substitute and
ingredient in some food products.
   The substance, acesulfame potassium, was developed in West
Germany and is used in 20 other countries as an additive in various
pharmaceutical products, some baked goods and candies, the Food and
Drug Administration said Wednesday.
   Regulations permitting use of the sweetener, to be marketed in
the United States as ``Sunette,'' take effect upon publication in
the Federal Register today.
   The FDA is allowing its use in chewing gum, dry beverage mixes,
instant coffee, instant tea, gelatins, puddings and non-dairy
creamers.
   However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
consumer interest group, told the FDA it was concerned that the
sweetener may have caused tumors found in laboratory animals.
   But the FDA said the tumors were ``what could routinely be
expected'' and not due to feeding with Sunette.
   Sunette is a product of the Hoechst Celanese Corp. of
Somerville, N.J., a subsidiary of Hoechst AG of Frankfurt, West
Germany. The company did not seek FDA approval to use Sunette in
soft drinks.
   The FDA deferred action on the company's request to use the
sweetener in candies and other confections in the United States.
   In the past the agency has interpreted the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act as barring the use of non-nutritive sweeteners in
candies.
   Sunette is said to be 200 times sweeter than sugar. It joins
saccharin, another no-calorie sweetener, and the low-calorie sugar
substitute aspartame on the U.S. market.

Modest Rebound: A look at the Gulf states suggests an upswing in the oil 
industry. The rig count in Louisiana rose again last week by four units to 143, 
an increase over the 12 rigs in the same week a year ago. Industry observers 
see this rebound from January's slip from 179 rigs to 139 as an indication of a 
better year ahead. At the same time, another source reports that the 
utilization rate of offshore mobile units in the Gulf rose to 69.8% from 45.8% 
a year ago. One company stepping up its exploration is Freeport-McMoRan 
Partners of New Orleans. The firm will increase its exploration and capital 
expenditures budget by 42% to $188 million, with $56 million slated for 
exploration alone. Times-Picayune, Morning Advocate

New Discount Strategy: It seems that last year's retail rage -- everyday low 
prices -- is this year's has-been strategy. Target discount stores tested the 
concept at 50 of its outlets and found that it failed to stimulate enough 
sales. In its place Target will try a system of "great buys," products at low 
prices that never go on sale, and weekly sales promotions. The company says 
this is a blend of what customers liked about both strategies. Detroit Free 
Press, Newsday

Approval Nears: Industry observers say two artificial sweeteners discovered in 
the early 1970s, Johnson &amp; Johnson's sucralose and Pfizer's alitame, may 
soon win approval of the Food and Drug Administration. Both sucralose and 
alitame are sweeter than Monsanto's aspartame (known commercially as 
NutraSweet), and both are heat stable, which aspartame is not. At the same 
time, Abbott Labs' cyclamate is under consideration by the FDA for 
reinstatement; the original data linking it to cancer apparently was flawed. 
The artificial sweetener market is also being pursued by Coca-Cola and 
Biospherics, both of which have products in the pipeline. The Atlanta Journal

Hot Competition: Two innovative antiperspirants, created by Helene Curtis and 
Revlon, will hit store shelves at the same time and both will be backed by big 
promotions. Helene Curtis' Degree, formulated to become effective when body 
heat rises, will receive a $50-million kick-off promotion, coupon and ad 
campaign. The company expects sales of the unisex product to reach $50 million 
in two years. At the same time, Revlon is introducing No Sweat, which works on 
the same principle as Degree but is triggered by moisture. This product will 
receive a $10-million ad boost. Crain's Chicago Business

   Consumer spending, the driving force behind
eight years of U.S. economic expansion, did not budge in October,
the government said in a report analysts contend was further
evidence of a recession.
   Accounting for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity,
consumer spending was unchanged from September at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, the Commerce Department
said Thursday.
   ``The consumer has retrenched,'' said economist Gilbert Benz of
the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. ``It clearly supports those who
say we're in a recession.''

   The government has charged 12 people with
attempting to distribute more than $500 million in securities
stolen from companies in New York and London.
   Those charged were accused of taking part in a conspiracy to
distribute about 291 million British pounds (about $550 million) in
treasury bills and certificates of deposit issued by the Bank of
England. The bank's employees had been robbed of the money at knife
point on May 2, according to the indictment, which was returned by
a federal grand jury in Manhattan and unsealed Thursday.

stock buyback.
   The company said it had no comment on Thursday's report, but its
stock jumped $4.87{ a share to $165.75 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. That followed a $5.87{ a share advance on Wednesday
and a $2.25 rise on Tuesday. The media company's stock remains well
below its high for the year of $206 a share, however.

   Diet colas are losing their sales fizz, and beverage
makers are scrambling to find a replacement.
   It's a matter of considerable urgency: Diet drinks fueled
the soft-drink industry's rapid growth in the 1980s. Now, to
drum up sales in a slowing market, the industry is looking at
such products as canned coffees, "new age" sodas, sports
drinks and juice drinks. Yesterday, for instance, Pepsi-Cola
said it would begin to distribute Ocean Spray juices in
January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Companies may also reformulate diet colas with new types
of sweeteners and aim them at new audiences.
   Whatever the ultimate answer, the fact is that beverage
makers are confronting a dramatically slowing market. For
much of the 1980s, the industry grew between 4% and 5%
annually -- primarily because of the exploding popularity of
diet colas. Today, industry growth has shrunk to between 2%
and 3%. Most notably, sales of diet soft drinks, which now
constitute 30% of the market, are no longer growing at
double-digit rates. This year, in a maturing market, sales of
both diet Coke and Diet Pepsi are expected to increase just
3% to 4% overall.
   Niche products like iced coffees or mountain blackberry
soda (made by Clearly Canadian Beverage Corp. in Vancouver)
may help soft-drink sales, but beverage executives doubt such
products represent the next blockbuster needed to carry the
industry through the 1990s. Specialty drinks "are never going
to be what the cola segment will be," observes J. Bruce
Llewellyn, chairman and chief executive officer of
Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. "No matter what
hocus-pocus there is, it doesn't amount to a hill of beans
compared with Coca-Cola."
   Or compared with its low-calorie cousin. Diet Coke, said
Roberto C. Goizueta, head of Coca-Cola Co., at its
introduction in 1982, "may well be the most successful new
product in the history of the soft-drink industry." He was
close. By 1984, diet Coke was the third most popular soft
drink in the country. In the same year, Coke and others began
substituting NutraSweet for saccharine in their diet drinks,
markedly improving the taste. More recently, beverage makers
have also begun chasing after men (women had been the first
target) by advertising diet drinks during sporting events.
   The upshot: Increases in sales of 20% for much of the
decade, recalls Ron Wilson, president of Philadelphia
Coca-Cola Bottling. "It was a gift horse to us."
   But the party is over. One reason is that low calories
aren't enough for many consumers these days. They also want
something that's healthy -- or appears to be.
   Enter "new age" sodas: fruity, clear beverages, often sold
in glass bottles, that have a wholesome air about them.
Clearly Canadian Beverage, with flavors like orchard peach,
sold in chunky blue glass bottles, expects sales this year of
$200 million, up from $17.3 million just two years ago.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola is considering packaging Fresca, its
diet grapefruit drink, in a green glass bottle next year.
PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, N.Y., says it wants to get
into the segment in a big way but has yet to see sales take
off in test markets for H2Oh, the flavored bottled water it
has been testing for two years. "We're not going to sit by
the sidelines and watch the thing called `new age' grow
without participating," promises David Novak, PepsiCo's vice
president for marketing.
   For now Pepsi is getting into the fastgrowing juice
segment. Yesterday, the company said it plans to distribute
Ocean Spray single-serve drinks in stores and vending
machines nationwide by the end of 1992. The deal will enable
Pepsi to profit from the 10% annual growth in the $12 billion
fruit-drink and juice market, says Michael Bellas, president
of Beverage Marketing Corp.
   In another area, Coke and Pepsi are testing sports drinks
to vie with Gatorade, the Quaker Oats Co. product that
controls 88% of the $1 billion retail market for sports
drinks. Pepsi, which originally tested a Mountain Dew sports
drink last year, switched the name to "All Sport" and came
out with three new flavors in May. The company expects to
roll out cans and bottles nationally in the second quarter of
next year. Coke has its sports drink, PowerAde, in 1,000
outlets, or only about 0.3% of its fountain accounts.
   But the new product expected to make the biggest splash is
iced and canned coffee, and -- to a lesser extent -- brewed
and flavored teas. This is despite the fact that U.S.
consumption of coffee has been flat for a decade and sales of
tea have fallen steadily. Beverage executives maintain that
canned coffee is convenient and that consumers increasingly
prefer cold and sweet drinks to hot ones.
   Coke and Nestle expect their Mocha Cooler and Ice Breaker,
flavored coffees now in test market, to be rolled out in cans
and fountains next spring. Beverage industry experts expect
Pepsi to team up with Thomas J. Lipton Inc. to distribute a
new line of their own brewed tea and coffee. Kraft General
Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., has been testing Cappio,
an iced-cappuccino drink, in Arizona since August 1990.
   Still, whether they be coffees, power drinks or "new age"
sodas, niche markets have drawbacks. To begin with, products
-- and product loyalty -- appear transient at best. In the
mid-1980s, Original New York Seltzer Co. enjoyed phenomenal
growth, capturing half a share point in the $46 billion
domestic soft-drink market. But the company's products, a
victim of fickle tastes, have retreated as of late.
   Then there are the beverage companies' giant distribution
systems -- geared toward cranking out soft drinks on a
massive scale and unable to benefit handsomely from niche
products. Such markets account for only $1.5 billion in
sales, according to Beverage Marketing Corp.'s Mr. Bellas,
while diet colas alone bring in $11 billion.
   All of which means that soft-drink companies will also
attempt to rejuvenate their diet drinks. Pepsi is planning a
"major all-out assault" to promote diet cola next year, in
stores and through national media, according to Mr. Novak,
the vice president for marketing.
   Both Coke and Pepsi are expected to set their advertising
to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. While men now
account for 43% of sales of diet colas, according to Simmons
Market Research, women still represent the greatest
opportunity for increased sales. "We don't want to take them
for granted," says Mr. Wilson at Philadelphia Coca-Cola
Bottling. To refocus on women, for example, Coke may scale
back use of endorsers like football players.
   Older drinkers -- the over-45 set, whose tastes seem to
favor less-sweet products and whose life styles become more
sedentary -- will also be a target of new marketing efforts,
as will blacks and Hispanics. Today, according to Simmons
Market Research, minority groups consume 20% less diet soda
than whites. To reach those groups, soft-drink makers will
"have to show them that you don't drink diet colas to look
like skinny white women," says Tom Pirko, president of
Bevmark Inc., a consulting firm.
   One way to do that, suggests Mr. Pirko, may be to to make
an appeal based on taste -- particularly if beverage makers
adopt new sweeteners in their diet drinks. That may occur as
early as December 1992, when the patent on the artificial
sweetener aspartame, held by NutraSweet, expires. "It will
kick a bunch of life into the diet category," predicts Mr.
Pirko.
   Perhaps, but "The company that guesses wrong on
replacement sweeteners could make the brouhaha {in 1985} over
`new Coke' look like a minor story," says Jesse Myers,
publisher of the trade publication Beverage Digest. "It could
be a marketing bonanza or a marketing fiasco."

By JANNY SCOTT, Scott is a Times medical writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intrepid science of food engineering reached an improbable juncture at UC 
Berkeley recently when food scientist Benito de Lumen began designing a bean 
devoid of that disconcerting attribute for which the legume is best known. 
</P>
<P>
De Lumen's quest for a flatulence-free frijole is part of a booming field of 
food research that has already produced such seeming gustatory oxymorons as 
low-cholesterol eggs, dietetic chocolate ice cream and high-fiber hamburger 
buns. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of scientists to design foods without their old drawbacks offers 
more than a promise of guilt-free gluttony: It holds out hope of controlling 
such threats as heart disease and cancer, linked to excesses in the American 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
But whether engineered food will fulfill that potential remains to be seen. 
Some nutritionists have doubts. They warn that such foods, consumed 
immoderately, could lead to new nutritional problems on a par with those they 
are intended to avert. 
</P>
<P>
"One could envision in the next 10 years that it would be possible to engineer 
any food that we eat that would be almost devoid of any nutritional content 
except for fiber, vitamins and minerals," says Theodore Labuza, a food 
scientist at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's very possible that the incredulous consumer . . . would begin eating 
these products solely. So they would end up not with vitamin or mineral 
deficiencies but . . . protein deficiencies and energy deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
What are the benefits and drawbacks of engineered foods? It is almost 
impossible to generalize. Some have no known shortcomings, but others may -- 
especially if they shoulder out more healthful foods from the American diet, 
nutritionists say. 
</P>
<P>
Low-fat and skim milk, for example, have no down-side. They offer all the 
benefits of whole milk without the fat and calories. Like modified mozzarella 
and ricotta cheese, they offer more protein, vitamins and calcium than the 
products they are designed to replace. 
</P>
<P>
But fat substitutes don't necessarily work that way. One, sucrose polyester, is 
not even digested by the body. That means that it has no calories or 
cholesterol, but that it also offers none of the essential fatty acids people 
need for growth and maintenance of their skin. 
</P>
<P>
Such a shortcoming matters little if the product is used in moderation. What 
concerns some nutritionists is that it might be consumed in excess, drawing 
eaters towards foods that have suddenly been rendered innocuous and away from 
more fortifying alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have both artificial sweeteners and fats, will people eat more cake?" 
wonders Audrey Cross, a nutritionist and lawyer at Columbia University School 
of Public Health. "And if they do, what will they be leaving out of their diet 
that they were eating before?" 
</P>
<P>
Not only might people eat less fruit, but they actually may eat more sugar as 
well. It remains to be proven that substitutes for foods such as fats and sugar 
can accomplish what promoters say they can -- that is, that they can reduce 
consumption of the real thing to recommended levels by substituting a less 
harmful alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption of sugars has risen steadily since the introduction of 
artificial sweeteners, health experts point out. Artificial-sweetener use has 
also soared, leading some experts to wonder whether sweeteners stimulate some 
people's appetite for sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Obesity, too, has continued to increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, there is no evidence that the proliferation of low-calorie foods, 
analogs and ingredients has affected the status of obesity in the United 
States," the Institute of Food Technologists, a professional scientific 
society, reported recently. "National statistics . . . show an increase in the 
prevalence of obesity, certainly no decrease." 
</P>
<P>
The first federal health and nutrition survey, conducted between 1971 and 1974, 
found that 28.8 million American adults were obese, 8.4 million of them 
severely. The second survey, done between 1976 and 1980, found that the numbers 
had risen to 34 million and 13 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the impetus for redesigning foods arises out of the growing evidence 
that diet plays a significant role in the development of chronic diseases -- 
specifically, diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, liver 
disease and cancer of the breast. 
</P>
<P>
Research indicates that one's risk of contracting such diseases can be 
controlled by selecting carefully the foods one eats. Numerous scientific 
panels have urged Americans to eat less food heavy in fat, and more high-fiber 
foods such as vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
"Engineering of foods, I think, is terrific," says Wayne Bidlack, an associate 
professor of pharmacology and nutrition at the University of Southern 
California. "We can decide what nutrients need to be delivered where, and 
design products for whatever is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 8,000 of the food products introduced in the United States in 1987 
involved nutritional modification, industry statistics show. Of those, more 
than 400 boasted reduced calories, 159 lower fat, 120 reduced sugar and 55 
added fiber. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing petitions to market two fat 
substitutes. Several sugar surrogates are in wide use and others are on the 
way. Fiber is being transferred, meats are being restructured. Even the walnut 
is up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the food supply is very, very difficult to make your way through 
intelligently -- for a consumer or for a nutritionist," says Joan Gussow, a 
professor of nutrition and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, deciphering the nutritional benefits and drawbacks of engineered foods is 
left largely to the consumer: The FDA regulates food additives and foods for 
special dietary uses, but its scrutiny is limited largely to the product's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
The agency examines an additive's chemical structure and the levels at which it 
is toxic in animals. But it does not address whether the product is 
nutritionally beneficial or desirable, says Gerad L. McCowin, who heads the 
FDA's division of food and color additives. 
</P>
<P>
"That there's a synthetic fat substitute or an artificial sweetener available, 
in and of itself, is neither good nor bad societally or nutritionally," he 
says. "What's good or bad is how the individual combines those various foods." 
</P>
<P>
A prime target of food engineering is fat. Fats currently make up 37% to 40% of 
the average American adult's caloric intake, but experts in heart disease and 
cancer have recommended that Americans lower that level to 30% or less. 
</P>
<P>
Most attempts to reduce fat in animal products have involved simple physical 
steps such as close trimming of beef cuts. Through selective breeding, farmers 
have also been reducing the back fat in hogs and abdominal fat in poultry. 
</P>
<P>
So-called restructuring -- dismantling a piece of meat and putting the parts 
back together as a new product -- is being used to produce leaner meat. 
Although researchers say that salt is added to the meat in the process, they 
say it is in quantities too small to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Some new "lite" deli meats may have a greater problem with salt, according to 
the Institute of Food Technologists. For that reason, the group concluded that 
modified convenience foods may offer little nutritional advantage over 
carefully selected fresh meats. 
</P>
<P>
But the most radical assault on fats is coming from substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sucrose polyester is made by chemically linking several fatty acid molecules to 
a molecule of sucrose, or table sugar. Because of its structure, it is not 
metabolized by the body and therefore contributes no fat, calories or 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble, which calls the product Olestra, has applied to the FDA 
to use it in shortenings and oils. If used widely, Olestra theoretically could 
replace up to 35% of the fat in retail shortening and up to 75% of the fat used 
for frying snack foods and in deep frying. 
</P>
<P>
At those levels, the company figures that Olestra consumers could cut their 
daily fat consumption by five grams out of an average intake of 80 to 90 grams. 
The percentage of fat calories in their diets would drop from 37% to 35%, 
according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
The other fat substitute before the FDA is Simplesse, produced by the 
NutraSweet Co. It consists of milk and egg protein cooked and blended in such a 
way as to simulate what food scientists like to call the "mouth feel" of fat. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Olestra, Simplesse is digestible. But it has less than half the calories 
of ordinary fat. It would be used in products such as salad dressing, 
mayonnaise and ice cream, but not for cooking. NutraSweet predicts it could 
reduce a person's fat calories to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
"The fat substitutes . . . offer exciting opportunities for us to have the 
satisfaction we get out of products that contain fats without the extra weight 
gain," says Fred Caporaso, chairman of food science and nutrition at Chapman 
College in Orange. "That's kind of neat, I think. As long as they're safe." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is studying the safety of the fat substitutes. Both companies say their 
products are harmless in the context of a balanced diet -- although NutraSweet 
notes that Simplesse should not be eaten by people sensitive or allergic to 
milk or eggs. 
</P>
<P>
As for Olestra, Procter &amp; Gamble says it would not affect absorption of 
dietary proteins and carbohydrates or of most fat-soluble vitamins. Because it 
could reduce absorption of Vitamin E, the company intends to supplement Olestra 
with that vitamin. 
</P>
<P>
One consumer group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has 
challenged Procter &amp; Gamble's safety claim and the animal studies on which 
it is based. It has asked the FDA to require more studies exploring the 
long-term effects of Olestra use. 
</P>
<P>
One professor of food science at the University of Arkansas raised a more 
philosophical objection to the advent of foods that are not what they seem. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts an intellectual dimension in eating that I'm personally concerned 
about," says Harry E. Snyder. "I just don't want to ask every time I sit down, 
'Is this real or fake and should I adjust accordingly?' I want to know it's all 
real food." 
</P>
<P>
A second target of food engineering is sugar. Three low-calorie and 
non-nutritive sweeteners are being used widely, despite questions about their 
effects on health and despite the fact that consumption of sugars has continued 
to rise. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest is saccharin, a non-nutritive sweetener that is not metabolized and 
therefore non-caloric. It remains in use under special Congressional 
dispensation in spite of research data suggesting it may contribute to bladder 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
An FDA move to ban saccharin has been suspended until at least 1992 pending 
further research. Products containing saccharin bear a health warning, but 
reviews by the American Medical Assn. and food technologists have failed to 
establish a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
A second sugar substitute is aspartame, or NutraSweet, a protein that carries 
with it four calories per gram. Because it is up to 220 times as sweet as table 
sugar, aspartame can be used in such small amounts that it is virtually 
non-caloric. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be safe in moderation, numerous groups have determined. Yet, 
there have been anecdotal reports of vision problems, seizures, headaches and 
dizziness. Aspartame accounts for four of every five complaints to the FDA 
concerning adverse reactions to food additives. 
</P>
<P>
The third available sweetener is acesulfame K, also known as Sunette. Approved 
in July, 1988, for use in dry mixes for beverages, instant coffee, puddings, 
non-dairy creamer and chewing gum, it is not metabolized and therefore 
contributes no calories to the diet. 
</P>
<P>
Professional opinion about the benefits of artificial sweeteners remains mixed. 
Bidlack calls aspartame "probably the most outstanding thing that happened to 
the sweetness market" because of its safety and sweetening power. But others 
are more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think health professionals are still wondering whether there's any real 
value in making a sweet product that doesn't have any health benefits of any 
kind," Snyder says. After all, he says, there is no evidence that sweeteners 
have cut overall sugar consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The next frontier for food engineers is cholesterol, believed by many 
researchers to be a prime culprit in cardiovascular disease. Because more than 
a third of dietary cholesterol comes from eggs, many researchers have focused 
on eggs first. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers claim to have already produced reduced-cholesterol eggs through 
selective breeding and control of chickens' diets. Some chickens have been fed 
fish oil, believed by some to lower cholesterol levels. But the eggs have 
occasionally ended up smelling of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers are testing more esoteric techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Beitz, a professor of animal science and biochemistry at Iowa State 
University, is working with an enzyme produced by bacteria in the human gut. 
According to Beitz, the enzyme breaks down cholesterol into an innocuous 
product that is then excreted.

Beitz has tested extracts containing the the enzyme on milk, ground pork and 
egg yolk and has produced the expected breakdown product. He is now attempting 
to develop more of the enzyme, which he hopes some day might be available to be 
sprinkled on high-cholesterol foods. 
</P>
<P>
One other area that has attracted food engineers' attention is fiber -- 
specifically, adding fiber to foods. Epidemiological studies have linked 
reduced rates of some cancers and gastrointestinal diseases to diets heavy in 
high-fiber foods. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, food manufacturers have begun supplementing baked goods with 
sugar beet fiber and apple and oat fiber. So-called light breads often contain 
added fiber, as do many cereals and high-fiber hamburger buns. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has developed something called fluffy 
cellulose to serve as a non-caloric fiber replacement for flour. Derived from 
sugar beet pulp or other agricultural byproducts, it can replace up to half the 
flour in cake or bread. 
</P>
<P>
There appear to be no risks involved with such products, according to experts 
in the nutritional benefits of fiber, although some note that excess fiber 
could limit absorption of important dietary minerals in a person with a 
marginal diet. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, many nutritionists are skeptical about fiber supplements. They advise 
consumers to rely instead on naturally high-fiber foods. Some say it is not 
clear that the health benefits of high-fiber foods such as fruits and 
vegetables come solely from the fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consume fiber in food, you consume a whole range of nutrients," says 
Barbara Schneeman, a professor of nutrition at UC Davis. "If you select some of 
these fiber supplements, you may not be getting the whole package of 
nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of fiber are being sold out there," Labuza says. "We don't really 
know whether (some) perform the function people think they perform, and if 
taking them out of one food and putting them in another they would still have 
the same function." 
</P>
<P>
One check on the proliferation of some engineered foods so far has been the 
ability of manufacturers to market their products. Outdated regulations on food 
composition have made some companies reluctant to manufacture nutritionally 
improved foods. 
</P>
<P>
But food producers insist consumers are often slow to change, too. 
</P>
<P>
They say many Americans raised on the taste of high-fat foods are often 
unwilling to accept nutritionally improved versions -- particularly since fat 
accounts for much of the tenderness, juiciness and flavor of meat and dairy 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost in the minds of these dairy companies is taking out the fat 
but making sure it tastes good," says Robert Boynton, executive director of the 
Dairy Institute of California. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do any good if you give them a product that's low in fat but 
doesn't deliver. That's really the challenge: How you make products that are 
good for them but still appealing?"

<HEAD>Sugar Industry's Ad Campaign Aimed At Sweetening Its Product's
Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn sugar and artificial
sweeteners are gaining a bigger share of the market, so the cane
and beet sugar industry plans to fight back with a $4 million
television advertising campaign.
   ``We'll associate sugar with happy moments,'' said Tony
Contreras, vice president of marketing for the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative in Belle Glade. ``It's a very positive, lifestyle-type
of campaign.''
   Following the lead of the beef, pork and poultry producers, the
sugar industry will try to increase consumption by focusing on the
``sweet, pure and natural'' aspects of sugar. The campaign starts
in March.
   Ads will be paid for by Florida's sugar cane growers and other
U.S. cane and beet growers, refiners and processors.
   ``The sugar market has dropped since the early 1970s. Actually
the market drop was caused by corn sweeteners,'' said Charlie
Shamel, president of The Sugar Association, a Washington, D.C.,
trade association.
   Manufacturers of soft drinks, canned fruit, table syrups and
other processed foods have turned to less expensive corn sweeteners
instead of cane or beet sugar.
   Meanwhile, total sugar consumption also is down. Per capita
sugar use could decline to 35 to 40 pounds by 1995 if the trend
continues, or less than half of what it was in the 1970s, Shamel
said.
   Unlike its magazing advertising last year which took a an
anti-aspartame tack, the Sugar Association TV drive will take a
pro-sugar approach. The campaign is geared toward giving viewers
``permission to eat sugar,'' Contreras said.
   ``We're not suggesting anyone pig out on sugar,'' said Shamel.
``But used in moderation, it tastes good and has a lot of benefits:
Adds texture in cakes, flavor to bland foods.''
   Past advertising by the sugar industry has been criticized for
its use of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration task force report
that the industry said confirms ``sugar is safe.''
   The 1986 FDA report found no direct link between sugar and major
diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, gallstones,
glucose intolerances or hyperactivity in children.
   A Washington, D.C., consumer group claims the sugar industry
manipulated the FDA report.
   ``The study was part of a series of studies on food additives,''
said Bruce Silverglade, legal affairs director for the Center for
Science in the Public Interest. ``Sugar was thrown in there along
with artificial sweeteners. It did not focus on the role sugar
plays in the diet.''
   The American Dental Association maintains that while sugar may
be a natural product, ``it causes tooth decay,'' said Rick Asa,
spokesman in Chicago for the ADA, which favors sugar substitutes.

   Genex Corp. said it agreed with Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet unit to settle a two-year-old lawsuit connected to NutraSweet's decision to stop buying raw material for its aspartame sweetener from the biotechnology research firm. 
Under the settlement, in which the companies agreed to release each other from all claims, Gaithersburg, Md.-based Genex plans to reverse a previously recorded liability of $1.4 million, which will be reflected as earnings in the third quarter. 
In the 1986 third quarter, Genex had a net loss of $961,000.

   DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet Co. unit said
it would dismiss as much as 12% of its work force, or between
170 and 200 employees, in a reorganization that combines its
two key food ingredients businesses.
   The company said its NutraSweet artificial sweetener and
Simplesse fat substitute products would be marketed to the
food and beverage industries in tandem. Previously each
product called on the industries separately.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, jobs are likely to be eliminated from the
company's research and development, business ventures and
corporate staffs as well as at the four plants that make
NutraSweet. Businesses exempt from cuts include Simplesse,
Simple Pleasures, a frozen dairy dessert, and Equal, a sugar
substitute.
   Although a NutraSweet spokesman said the reorganization
didn't indicate any unhappiness by Monsanto, industry sources
say the company is anxious to improve the return on its
costly investment in Simplesse, which has been on the market
about a year.
   A Monsanto spokeswoman said the costs associated with the
work force reduction would not result in a charge against
future earnings. The dismissals are to begin shortly.
   Separately, NutraSweet's Simplesse Co. unit said that
Simple Pleasures is expanding its dessert line with several
flavors, and would be moving into the New York, Philadelphia
and Boston markets after achieving what it said was a 19%
market share elsewhere in the super-premium ice cream
category.
   Simplesse also said it was awaiting Food and Drug
Administration approval for use of the fat substitute in
mayonnaise, cheese, sour cream, dips, salad dressing, yogurt
and cheesecake.

   Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet Co. subsidiary said it will roll
out in June an artificial sweetener in bulk form that will
compete in the same market as its own Equal product.
   The new product, called NutraSweet Spoonful, is a
granulated sweetener designed to spoon, measure and taste
like sugar, the company said. It contains two calories per
teaspoon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   NutraSweet, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it hopes the
new product will woo sugar users who are "careful about what
they eat, but aren't necessarily dieting." Packaged in a
glass jar, the product more closely resembles the real thing
than the company's Equal product, which comes in small
packets or tablets.
   It wasn't immediately clear to what extent NutraSweet
Spoonful would cannibalize Equal's market share. For now,
only Equal will be sold for restaurant use. But the products
will go head-to-head in the retail tabletop sweetener market,
of which Equal holds a 67% share, the spokesman said.

   It's cold, wet and creamy, and sweet on the
tongue. It's thicker than top superpremium ice cream brands, and
just a little bit harder to scrape with your spoon.
   It doesn't taste exactly like Haagen-Dasz or Ben &amp; Jerry's, but
what do you expect for a product with half the calories and
one-fifteenth the fat?
   NutraSweet Co., the maker of NutraSweet low-cal sweetener, is
hoping for a mouthful with Simple Pleasures, a superpremium ice
cream substitute with no fat and low cholesterol.
   Its secret lies in Simplesse, a product made from egg whites and
milk protein that has no cholesterol and no fat. Simplesse
eventually may be used as a substitute for other dairy products
like yogurt, sour cream, butter, margarine and cheese.
   Simple Pleasures was unveiled for reporters Thursday after
becoming the first fat-substitute product to win approval from the
Food and Drug Administration.
   The real taste test will come this summer when it shows up in
seven flavors in supermarkets across the country. Distribution in
Europe is expected by the end of the year, said Simplesse general
manager David L. Morley.
   ``It's potentially very significant. This is the first non-fat
fat, so to speak, to be approved on the market,'' said Harvey
Stober, a chemical analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., who said
sales could grow to $500 million or $1 billion a year in several
years.
   Monsanto stock jumped higher following the FDA approval,
finishing $4.37{ higher at $112.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Simplesse is aimed at customers who want to cut the amount of
fat and cholesterol in their diet while satisfying their taste
buds. It will be launched in an age of dieting and health
consciousness, when customers have lined their shelves with
products such as oat bran and spring water.
   Simplesse cannot be used in frying or baking, however, because
it congeals at higher temperatures. And the company has yet to come
up with a vanilla flavor Simple Pleasures that meets its
expectations.
   ``Potentially it could help somebody lower their fat intake. But
if you're not careful it might have undesirable effects on the
diet,'' said Lisa Lefferts, a staff scientist at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a Washington watchdog group.
   ``We don't know whether they'll substitute it for fat, or people
will just eat more double-scoop ice cream cones.''
   But Robert Shapiro, NutraSweet's chairman and chief executive,
said Simple Pleasures could resolve the conflict between eating
healthy foods and indulging in what tastes good. Americans reduced
the fat in their diets by 3 percent from 1982 to 1988 but still ate
an average 5 gallons of ice cream last year, according to
NutraSweet.
   ``Simplesse is in our view nothing less than a historical
breakthrough in food technology, in the never-ending conflict
between health and indulgence,'' Shapiro said. ``Simplesse means we
can now enjoy all the rich, creamy taste of foods ... without the
fat, without the calories, without the worry and without the
guilt.''
   A 4-ounce serving of strawberry flavor has 120 calories and less
than 1 gram of fat, compared to 250 calories and 15 grams for
superpremium ice cream. Morley said Simple Pleasures uses sugar,
not NutraSweet, although the sugar and fat substitutes could be
used together.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit in Washington said NutraSweet would
have to seek separate federal approval for other products
containing Simplesse, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, sour
cream or frozen yogurt.
   Nevertheless, NutraSweet already has agreed to supply Simplesse
to Kraft-General Foods Inc. for its mayonnaise and Miracle Whip
salad dressing.
   Just as diet soda and other low-calorie products bear the
NutraSweet logo, Simple Pleasures and other Simplesse-containing
products will bear a special logo, a red and white circle and
rectangle imprinted with a blue ``Simplesse.''
   All new products will be made and marketed by Simplesse Co., a
new division of NutraSweet.
   Two other companies have petitions pending for fat substitutes.
Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is seeking permission for
Olestra, a synthetic product make of sugar and oils that would be
used in shortenings, oils and snacks like potato chips, said
spokesman Don Tassone. The petition, submitted in April 1987,
remains pending.
   Kraft, of Glenview, Ill., is seeking permission to use a fat
substitute in frozen esserts. Kraft spokeswoman Kathy Knuth said
the petition is pending and could be approved later this year.

   Monsanto Co. expects sales to be up moderately this year, largely because of strong chemical sales and continuing improvement in sales of its Roundup herbicide, Richard J. Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   But Mr. Mahoney wouldn't speculate about Monsanto's earnings for either the 1987 first quarter or full year. 
He also declined to comment on analysts' projections that the company will earn between $5.40 and $6.25 a share in 1987. 

   In 1986, Monsanto had net income of $433 million, or $5.55 a share, on sales of $6.88 billion. 

   Sales of Lasso, one of the company's two major herbicides, aren't likely to rise enough to offset the effect of recent price cuts, Mr. Mahoney said in an interview. 
Last month, Monsanto said it was cutting the price of Lasso about 6%, the first such cut for the herbicide, to counter price cutting by competitors. 

   Mr. Mahoney said he expects Monsanto's Fischer Controls International Inc. unit to return to "strong" profitability this year, after posting an operating loss of $66 million in 1986. 
The unit, which makes valves and automated-process-control gear, has been hurt by sluggish economic growth and a depressed oil-processing industry. 

   Users of Monsanto's NutraSweet artificial sweetener are likely to continue to make inventory adjustments in the first quarter, trimming sales, Mr. Mahoney said. 
NutraSweet sales fell sharply in the 1986 fourth quarter as makers of powdered soft drinks reduced their inventories. 
However, Mr. Mahoney said fundamental demand for NutraSweet continues to rise, because diet soft drinks still are raising their share of the overall soft-drink market. 

   Sales of Monsanto's Roundup herbicide rose 25% by volume in 1986, more than overcoming the effect of some price reductions, Mr. Mahoney said. 
New Roundup mixtures aimed at the home garden and industrial markets sold well, he said. 

   Mr. Mahoney said he expects the performance of Monsanto's chemical business, its largest unit, to remain strong. 
However, any recovery of the company's electronics business, which makes silicon wafers, depends on "the elusive semiconductor recovery," he added. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Monsanto shares closed at $79.375, up 50 cents.

   Miller Lite, which yanked its $110 million account from
Backer Spielvogel Bates just two months ago, already is on
the air trying to lure younger drinkers with new spots from
ad agency Leo Burnett.
   The new commercials -- one stars "Saturday Night Live"
comic Kevin Nealon in his smarmy "Mr. Subliminal" adman role
-- waste no time in all but killing off Lite's campaign
featuring legions of retired jocks. Curiously, though, they
don't do away with the long-running "tastes great, less
filling" debate created by Backer, a unit of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Co. Instead, the new spots answer the debate. Sort
of.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Is Miller Lite America's favorite because it's less
filling or because it tastes great?" the ads ask. The answer:
"Yes."
   The ads are the first work from Chicago-based Leo Burnett,
which won the Philip Morris beer brand in March in the
biggest account switch the ad industry has seen in years.
Burnett inherited a huge brand that nevertheless faces big
problems. After 17 years of ads chock-full of retired jocks
-- spots that all began to look the same -- Lite is losing
share to such competitors as Bud Light and Coors Light. At
the same time, Lite's drinkers are older than those of its
competitors.
   "They have to aim at a younger audience," says Jerry
Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insight, a West Nyack,
N.Y., trade publication. According to Beverage Marketing
Corp., a New York consultant, 23% of Lite drinkers are older
than age 50, far more than for other light beers. Only 47% of
Lite drinkers are in the desirable 18-to-34-year-old age
group, for example, compared with 57% for Michelob Light's
drinkers.
   The new Lite commercials clearly aim to remedy that
problem. As "Mr. Subliminal," Saturday Night Live's Mr.
Nealon wends his way through a crowded bar that looks like
the setting for one of Coors Light's rock 'n' roll
pickup-spot ads. "What they won't do in commercials these
days," he says, adding under his breath, "buy Miller Lite."
He makes his way to the bar, where he uses "subliminal"
seduction to hit on a svelte young babe: "Hi (your place).
Would you like to join me for a Lite (your treat) -- it's on
me." "Okay," she answers, "but it's my treat."
   A second commercial centers yet again on a yuppie putting
the moves on a woman at a bar. This time, every question he
asks her, she answers "yes" -- ranging from "Do you wear
Spandex all the time, or is it a Tuesday thing?" to "Is
Miller Lite America's favorite because it's less filling or
because it tastes great?"
   Yet Miller is clearly skittish about moving away too
abruptly from its retired-jock campaign, which did, after
all, help make Lite the best-selling light beer in the
country. While the company began airing its new commercials
last weekend, it did so without fanfare and played down the
new ads when questioned. "It's a continuation of the
advertising which talks about tastes-great and less-filling
attributes," a spokesman said.
   Indeed, one new commercial even uses jocks, though they
aren't retired and they aren't arguing about tasting great or
being less filling. But the spot, which aired last weekend,
won't be seen again. One of its stars is Don Zimmer, who was
released yesterday as manager of the Chicago Cubs. In the
commercial, he and Cincinnati Reds manager Lou Piniella
argued over Astroturf, with Mr. Piniella, an Astroturf fan,
comparing it to "America's favorite light beer. . . . It
leaves out all the things you don't need -- tricky hops, slow
infielders, ugly grass stains." The spot had aired only in
Chicago and Cincinnati anyway, the spokesman said.
   Miller faces an enormous challenge in trying to attract
new drinkers while keeping its core group of loyalists. For
example, given its ingrained macho advertising, it would be
difficult to launch a campaign geared toward women, as
Michelob Light is currently doing in women's magazines. That
ad pictures torn-out headline snippets like "Lose fat while
you shop" and "Blast jiggly hips and thighs," and advises,
"Relax. You're OK. Improve your beer."
   "There is no way to renovate Miller Lite. You can't take
something that is so deeply ingrained into the American
consciousness -- the images of aging jocks -- and effectively
change it into another breed," contends Tom Pirko, president
of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based consulting company. He
believes Miller's only hope of tackling light-beer
competitors is to tout an entirely different brand, like its
new Light Ultra beer. It should tinker with Lite's
advertising, he says, but "you can't take a cow and change it
into a horse."
                                                                                                       

   Robbins Named Lintas CEO
                                                                                                       

   Kenneth L. Robbins was named chairman and chief executive
officer of Lintas: Worldwide, succeeding William Weithas, who
moves to the new post of vice chairman of Interpublic Group,
Lintas's parent.
   Mr. Robbins, 55 years old, was seen as the likely
successor to Mr. Weithas. Mr. Robbins had headed Lintas's
London-based international operations for the past five years
and previously was head of Lintas's flagship New York office.
   Mr. Weithas, 62, has been chairman of the agency since
1979, when it was acquired by Interpublic Group. He oversaw
the integration of Lintas into the holding company. In his
new post, Mr. Weithas said he will be "keeping a dialogue
with major clients," giving Interpublic Chairman Philip Geier
more time for other duties.
   Separately, Interpublic Group's board voted to increase
its quarterly dividend to 21 cents a share from 19 cents. The
dividend will be payable June 17 to stock of record May 31.
                                                                                                       

   NutraSweet's New Campaign
                                                                                                       

   NutraSweet Co. next week begins a new ad campaign, playing
up its artificial sweetener's 10th anniversary and seeking to
cement consumer loyalty.
   The effort comes as NutraSweet, a unit of Monsanto, braces
for the expiration of its patent on the aspartame sweetener
late next year -- and for a flood of competitors to enter the
category. In anticipation of an end to its monopoly, the
company earlier this year realigned operations to focus more
on its customer base.
   The campaign is the first from Chiat/Day/Mojo, the Venice,
Calif., agency that won the U.S. account last December. Ads
hark back to the sweetener's introduction; a gumball, one of
the first products sweetened with NutraSweet, figures
prominently. The tagline: "Making the world a better place to
eat."
   In one TV spot, the voice-over says nothing but "blah blah
blah" for the entire commercial. Meanwhile, type on the
screen says, "Some studies show that people don't listen to
the words in commercials," and goes on to plug the sweetener.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Monsanto hit by higher costs
</HEADLINE>

A rise of almost 20 per cent in raw material costs contributed to a 14 per
cent drop in operating income at Monsanto, the US chemicals group, in the
third quarter.
Other factors were lower margins in Roundup herbicide, lower bulk prices for
the artificial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) and the absence of income
from discontinued businesses. However, the company was on its way to 'an
outstanding 1994', Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman, said.
Worldwide sales of Roundup were well ahead in the quarter, though a tilt in
volume towards lower-margin markets as a result of weather conditions had
reduced profits. Operating profits in pharmaceuticals were maintained on a 4
per cent rise in sales.
Sales of the controversial substance BST (bovine somatotropin), used to
increase milk yields, were well ahead of expectations, the company said.
Introduced to the US market early this year, Posilac - Monsanto's version of
BST - had got off to 'a very good start', a spokesman said.
Net earnings for the quarter, helped by a Dollars 21m tax settlement, were
up 22 per cent at Dollars 116m, or 99 cents a share.
Full-year net earnings from Rohm and Haas, the speciality chemicals
producer, should beat their previous record of Dollars 230m set in 1988, Mr
Lawrence Wilson, chairman, said yesterday. Net earnings in the third quarter
were Dollars 55m, compared with a loss of Dollars 23m, bringing the
nine-month total to Dollars 211m.
