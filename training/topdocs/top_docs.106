FT  25 JAN 93 / Ashdown calls for change to monarchy
</HEADLINE>

   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined prominent
members of Labour's front bench in arguing for a fundamental overhaul of the
workings of the monarchy.
His remarks will stir fresh debate on the opposition benches at a time when
the Labour leadership has been trying to play down the issue for fear of
alienating royalist voters.
A straw poll of 100 Labour MPs in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday showed
almost a quarter want a republic, 32 per cent a monarchy along Dutch or
Scandinavian lines and only 14 per cent back the royal family continuing
unchanged.
Meanwhile, Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of York, said the religious
make-up of the country had changed so much that the Church of England must
debate the privileged position it held with the monarchy.
On the BBC Heart of the Matter programme he said he believed the coronation
oath, in which the sovereign pledges to uphold the Church of England, would
have to be revised when a new king or queen ascended the throne.
Mr Ashdown said on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme he believed it
unlikely that Britain would opt for a 'bicycling monarchy' as witnessed
elsewhere in northern Europe.
But Mr Ashdown added: 'We could strip away some of the pomp and circumstance
of the monarchy, bring it closer to the reality of life in Britain.
'I hazard a guess that that's a view held, for instance, by Prince Charles
and perhaps her majesty herself.'
Arguing that Britain looked increasingly out of date and also advocating the
case for the disestablishment of the Church of England, he added that the
royal family could easily perform its constitutional role by functioning on
a more modest scale.
The Liberal Democrat leader's comments add to the difficulties of Mr John
Smith, who has intentionally sought to avoid entering into the controversy
over the royal family's future.
The Labour leader had been planning to make a speech on constitutional
reform early next month, but has now postponed it.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Royal book prompts ministers to defend monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers yesterday tried to quell public anxiety about the future of
the monarchy after the publication of extracts from a controversial book
about the private life of the Prince of Wales.
Amid concern that the book, written with Prince Charles's co-operation,
could undermine the monarchy's authority, two cabinet ministers and a
constitutional expert launched a spirited defence of the heir to the throne.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said recent revelations in books and
newspapers about the royal family had led to the monarchy's detractors
'getting everything out of proportion'.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the revelations in
the book posed no threat to the monarchy. 'It is the monarchy, of which
Prince Charles is ultimately the heir, which matters, not the flotsam and
jetsam of journalism about personal feelings, however sincere they may be,'
he told Sky television.
The book, written by Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, the broadcaster, was serialised
in yesterday's Sunday Times and contains a detailed and unprecedented
account of the difficulties of Prince Charles's marriage.
The prince said through his private office yesterday that he had no regrets
about helping to write the book, and that it could be regarded as 'a
balanced and thoroughly researched appraisal' of his development as an
individual and the way he has approached his role.
Buckingham Palace admitted that the timing had been unfortunate, coming on
the eve of the Queen's state visit to Russia today, the first by a reigning
British monarch.
Interviewed on BBC radio's World This Weekend, Mr Hurd, who will accompany
the Queen to Moscow, attacked the determination of the British press to
divulge intimate secrets of the royal family's lives. He said: 'I am worried
about the way in which chattering people concerned with headlines and mass
circulation do chip away at our institutions in this country, of which the
monarchy is perhaps the most important and in a way the most vulnerable.'
Lord St John of Fawsley, former cabinet member and a constitutional expert,
said the book was 'immensely serious' and 'of very great historical
importance'. But he admitted the prince had adopted a 'high risk' strategy
by co-operating with the author of the book.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a front bench Labour spokesman, criticised Prince
Charles, saying the book had merely compounded the debate about the
monarchy.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Benn says 'loophole' will let him block royal succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP for Chesterfield, yesterday claimed to have
found a constitutional loophole that may put an end to Britain's
1,000-year-old hereditary monarchy.
His claim raises the republican flag at Westminster at a time of increasing
controversy over Prince Charles's fitness to inherit the throne.
It coincides with the transmission later today of an ITV documentary in
which the prince is said to admit adultery and to promote the
disestablishment of the Church of England.
The claim caused a storm among defenders of the monarchy.
Mr Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said Mr
Benn's statement was 'of such temerity that, in times past, he would have
been charged with treason'.
Mr Benn said 'years' of research had shown that the succession to the throne
could be blocked by a single objection by a member of the Privy Council, the
medieval eminent body that advises the sovereign.
Mr Benn, a privy councillor since 1964, said it was his 'solemn intention'
to prevent the publication of the proclamation announcing the accession of
the next monarch after the death or abdication of the Queen.
But constitutional experts said that Mr Benn's threat to block the
succession rests on the assertion that the proclamation would be invalid
without unanimous assent.
The traditional wording used in the proclamation asserts that the new
sovereign is proclaimed 'with one voice and consent of tongue and heart' of
the privy councillors and 'gentlemen of quality' present.
Mr Nigel Nicholls, clerk to the privy council, said it was not clear whether
a privy councillor's objection would block the publication of the
proclamation.
Even if it did, that would not affect the accession of the new monarch.

FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Motion to scrap monarchy
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal Democrats yesterday voted by an overwhelming majority against a
policy of abolition of the monarchy, but called for 'a radical trimming' of
the royal family's budget.
In the first debate at a political party conference on the issue, several
speakers argued that the monarchy should be discontinued after the reign of
the present Queen because hereditary rule was unacceptable in a modern
democracy.
But delegates were strongly swayed by the argument that the party's standing
with the public would be badly damaged if it backed abolition.
Several party MPs had privately expressed concern that, after voting to
decriminalise cannabis, Liberal Democrats risked antagonising public opinion
by passing another unprecedented resolution.
Opening one of the best-attended debates of the conference, Mr Alex Wilcock
of Liberal Democratic Youth and Students said all government posts in a
democracy must be open to everyone, elected by the public and subject to
regular scrutiny.
'The monarchy fails on all these counts,' he said.
Another speaker, Mr Norman Baker, said he could not understand why a member
of the royal family like the Duke of Gloucester should receive an annual
salary of Pounds 100,000. 'You can tell a lot about a country that has a
Royal Mint, but a national debt,' he said.
However, Mr Archie Kirkwood, the party's chief whip in the Commons, appeared
to win over many of the delegates by arguing that they needed to attack the
abuse of power by government ministers rather than royalty.
Deciding not to call for the abolition of the monarchy 'subject to a
referendum', the conference instead called for a cut in the size of the
Civil List and 'the redefining of the roles of members of the royal family
apart from the monarch'.

FT  28 DEC 94 / The prince as candidate: The heir to the British throne has
come to resemble a politician running for office, argues Andrew Adonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Charles is running for office as surely as any politician fighting an
election campaign. That is the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from his
actions in 1994 - yet another turbulent year for Britain's royal family.
The British public and media have been slow to recognise Charles Windsor,
embattled candidate for the throne of the United Kingdom and a collection of
other realms and territories including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Understandably, they have assumed that Charles will ascend the throne as a
matter of course, unless he chooses to relinquish his birthright in favour
of his eldest son, William - a theme of intermittent tabloid speculation but
little more.
It is now clear that Charles does not see things so simply. His motives for
embarking on a campaign for office can only be speculated upon: insecurity
about his public standing, fear for the long-term damage done by his
separation from Diana, and concern about the steadily declining reputation
of the royal family are the obvious factors.
Whatever the prince's precise motives, the evidence of a
carefully-orchestrated campaign is unambiguous.
The planning stage appears to have been the months immediately preceding the
separation in December 1992. In the summer of 1992 the prince agreed to
allow Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, a senior BBC journalist with impeccable
Establishment credentials, to write an authorised biography.
The arrangement was astonishing for a public figure in mid-career. The
prince gave Mr Dimbleby lengthy, intimate interviews, had him 'shadow' his
private and social engagements, and arranged for friends and some relatives
to be interviewed discreetly. Mr Dimbleby was given unprecedented access to
the prince's private and official papers, including ministerial
correspondence. There was a formal agreement to allow the prince to read the
manuscript and comment on 'inaccuracies'.
The prince's agreement with Mr Dimbleby amounted, in effect, to the
preparation of a manifesto for office. Far from disguising the fact the
author parades it.
In the preface to The Prince of Wales, published last month, he stresses his
growing intimacy with Charles and his efforts to 'accommodate' the prince's
sensitivities. 'I have learnt too much about my subject to be either
indifferent or dispassionate,' he writes, adding the hope that readers 'will
emerge at the other end feeling that they have come to know the heir to the
throne as they never could before - and that he is well worth knowing.'
Like an election manifesto, the book is partly a defence of the prince's
record to date and partly a prospectus for office. The 'defence' recites the
prince's public works, and offers apologias for his shortcomings in which
everything from bullying at school to unsatisfactory relationships with his
father and Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher are prayed in aid. The
prospectus includes a plea for the maintenance of the royal yacht and a
proposal to broaden his future spiritual role beyond the Church of England
(as 'Defender of Faith').
The book has gone hand in hand with a media offensive. In October of last
year, St James's Palace told the FT that the prince was available to be
'shadowed' on a week-long trip to the Middle East. The prince regards the
promotion of British business as an important part of his role, and the FT
was the ideal outlet for his views on the subject. It led to a full-length
profile - which dominated the media - entitled: 'A prince captured: The heir
to the British throne believes he could be used more effectively in
promoting UK plc.'
The FT article was a prelude to the main event: a three-hour television
documentary in June presented by Mr Dimbleby. In campaign terms, this was
equivalent to the party political broadcast, although unusual in attracting
13m viewers. The manifesto was broadcast to the backdrop of appropriate
action shots; and the prince, no doubt advised that it is now fashionable
for candidates to come clean about peccadillos, adopted a suitably pained
expression to confess adultery.
As the first year of the campaign draws to a close, it is time to take
stock. Is the prince a novel royal entrepreneur? And novel or not, is he
wise to be alarmed about his succession prospects?
There is nothing novel in the prince's endeavours. Every century or so since
the Norman Conquest serious efforts have been made to repackage the
monarchy. Some, such as Elizabeth I's bid to become 'Faerie Queene', were
resoundingly successful; others, notably attempts by Edward II, Richard II,
James II, and Charles I to seize power from established elites, were less
so.
The most successful of recent royal redesigns was the creation of the
modern, constitutional and ceremonial monarchy under Queen Victoria in the
mid-19th century. Dubbed by historians the 'invention of tradition', it was
a brilliant ploy to renovate medieval royal pageantry and represent what
were previously the symbols of office as its substance. Disraeli's
proclamation of Victoria as 'Empress of India' was the final triumph,
presenting the monarchy as the emblem of imperial unity.
The monarchy has remained largely stuck in this Victorian groove. Some
changes have been necessary: the Empress of India has become head of the
Commonwealth. But the hallmark of the current reign has been the dedication
of the Queen and her advisers to the Victorian legacy. Indeed, Elizabeth II
does it better than Victoria herself: the aged widow performed few public
duties, rarely even opening parliament in person.
No one with historical sense can doubt that the monarchy will need to be
'reinvented' in the next reign if it is to survive. But, in considering
whether the prince is right to be alarmed, the peculiar feature of his
manifesto is its failure to address two of the institution's greatest
weaknesses: its lack of a European role, and social changes that are making
the public ever less enamoured of royal flummery.
While the monarchy had excellent European credentials until the early part
of this century, with Victoria related to all the Continent's leading
rulers, today's monarchy has barely any European dimension.
The threat to the monarchy is insidious, not immediate. It comes from the
increasing irrelevance of its role, and from steadily eroding popular
respect and support. Should the erosion continue, politicians are bound to
start dabbling in republicanism. A tell-tale sign was the call earlier this
month by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's new home affairs spokesman, for a smaller,
Scandinavian-style, monarchy.
More ominous, perhaps, is the growing republican tide in the former
dominions. Australia looks increasingly set to hold a referendum on the
future of the monarchy at the end of the Queen's reign or perhaps sooner.
New Zealand may follow suit, to judge by the surprise declaration by its
prime minister last March in favour of such a move.
Such referendums are bound to attract notice and stir a debate in the UK. It
is not inconceivable that they would prompt calls for a vote at home too.
Another straw in the wind is the growing political popularity of referendums
on important constitutional issues. If such a vote is held on a single
European currency, for example, the chances of a referendum on the future of
the monarchy could be increased dramatically.
Even if all this were to come to pass, the prospect of the prince losing his
election must be small. However unpopular the royals, the difficulty of
devising arrangements for an alternative head of state, which is currently
dogging Australia's republicans, would powerfully reinforce the status quo.
Yet Candidate Charles might care to ponder the proverb that, in politics,
the expected never happens.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Anger as Blair stands by monarchy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's leadership last night stood by its plans to reform the monarchy in
the face of furious government claims that the opposition's constitutional
reform proposals would lead to the break-up of the UK.
Amid growing acrimony, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, made clear that he
had approved comments by Mr Jack Straw, shadow home secretary, broadcast in
a BBC Television Panorama documentary last night.
But Mr Stephen Dorrell, heritage secretary, challenged Labour in the Commons
to make royal reform an election issue, and accused the party of seeking to
impose a 'straitjacket' of political correctness on the royal family.
Mr Straw, who suggested a reduction in the number of royals carrying out
official functions, said his comments were in line with existing party
policy.
Labour officials also suggested that his remarks reflected the views of the
Prince of Wales, who has made little secret of his belief that the monarchy
must change with the times.
However, ministers queued up to attack Mr Straw's comments, underlining
Conservative hopes that the issue will deflect attention from the
government's problems over Europe and value added tax.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said Labour's proposals, which include
ending the royal prerogative, would lead to 'the break-up of Britain as we
know it'.
Mr David Hunt, the cabinet's chief political troubleshooter, claimed that Mr
Straw's comments were out of line with Labour policy and challenged Mr Tony
Blair to overrule him.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said people would be disgusted by
a policy that threatened the monarchy's future. He told BBC Radio: 'What
most astounds me is that Labour throws around constitutional change without
any thought, with absolute gay abandon.'
Mr Dorrell, speaking during the resumed Budget debate, said Labour had begun
its attempt to change tradition in the summer when Ms Mo Mowlam, then shadow
heritage secretary, suggested the royal family should move from Buckingham
Palace into a 'designer palace'.
While Labour leaders had then sought to distance themselves from Ms Mowlam,
that defence had been 'blown to smithereens' over the weekend by the latest
proposals by Mr Straw. Mr Dorrell accepted that a debate on the future role
of the royal family was desirable, but fundamentally disagreed with Mr
Straw. To government cheers he forecast that if the debate went to the
'court of public opinion' the Conservatives would win hands down.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, suggested that the majority of
the people probably wanted the monarchy to end when the Queen's reign
finished. He said it was not because of the growth of republicanism per se -
'I wish it was' - but because of the 'shenanigans' that had taken place at
Buckingham Palace.

<TEXT>
THE QUEEN by Kenneth Harris Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 341 pages
Walter Bagehot was a lucky man. When he wrote The English Constitution, in
1867 including the famous section on the monarchy, he could have had no idea
that Queen Victoria would go through a period of intense unpopularity, yet
survive to be mourned as a supreme national symbol in 1901.
Still less could he have known that succeeding kings and queens would take
his words as holy writ. In 1894 the future George V was given a Cambridge
tutor in constitutional history. Bagehot was almost the sole text. The
king-to-be wrote in his notes that kingship in Britain is 'still a great
political force and offers a splendid career to an able monarch'.
George VI was steeped in Bagehot too and so, in those years before close
heirs to the throne went to school, was the present queen. The key passage
is that the sovereign has three rights: the right to be consulted, the right
to encourage and the right to warn. Those rights have remained gospel,
accepted by monarchs and prime ministers alike.
At least until the late 1980s, when family troubles began to beset her,
Queen Elizabeth II was a very lucky woman. She was named Elizabeth not after
Elizabeth I, but after her mother. Probably she would not have become queen
without the abdication of Edward VIII, and she would not have reached the
throne so young without the premature death of her father George VI.
She did so at a time of hope. 'It may well be', prime minister Churchill
said of her Commonwealth coronation tour in 1953, 'that the journey the
Queen is about to take will be no less auspicious and the treasure she
brings back no less bright than when Drake first sailed an English ship
around the world.'
Over 40 years later, at the very least she has stuck to the Bagehot rules
when much around her has changed or collapsed. One of the biggest changes of
all, Kenneth Harris points out, has been in the royal family itself. 'When
she became Queen, there were only her mother, her sister, her husband and
herself. By the mid-80s there were at least 20 royals.' It is the
proliferation of lesser royals, rather than the monarchy as part of the
constitution, that has caused problems.
Harris suggests that his book, simply called The Queen, is not so much a
biography, more a way of life. 'The Queen: her background and times' might
be a more pretentious title, yet it would be more accurate. The book falls
into three unequal parts. The first, best and longest covers her upbringing
and her recent ancestry and family influences. The second is a summary of
what has happened in the last 30 years or so. The third is a fairly anodyne
epilogue of the author's thoughts on the monarchy.
To a retentive memory, there will be little that is new, though even good
memories need to be jogged. I had forgotten, for example, that there is
still an unanswered question about how much the Queen was told of the
preparations for Suez in 1956. She might have been expected to warn against
the operation.
As for judgments, Harris treads successfully what Kenneth Baker once called
'the narrow strip of land that lies between sycophancy and rebellion'. 'So
long as she is there,' he concludes, 'the monarchy seems secure.' Then he
predicates a new lease of life from Prince Charles. That seems to me
dangerous ground. Practically all predictions about the future of the
British monarchy have been wrong and, like Victoria, the present queen may
last a very long time.

FT  18 OCT 94 / A royal pipe-dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Charles and Diana' story is the opium of the people. It attracts
immense interest in most countries, but at home it does more. In Britain,
gossip about the private life of the scions of the House of Windsor is an
obsession of the tabloids, a quick-seller for the serious newspapers,
dominant on the airwaves, an easy topic of conversation, the stuff of
fantasy and scribblers' invention, marginal, fluffy, inconsequential - and,
as such, a substitute for thought, a painkiller for a bewildered national
psyche. It is, in short, a constant distraction from genuine problems of
governance, evidence of a polity thrashing around for a sense of purpose.
The latter is the serious element in an essentially unserious flow of media
pap. It may be that this flow has latterly been stimulated by the heir to
the throne and his estranged wife, but that is beside the point. The British
people approach the end of the 20th century as uncertain about their role in
the world as at any time since the end of empire. Historians will be
justified if they label it the century of moral decline.
The final decade is already looking inglorious. A prize for literature is
awarded to a 'novel' widely acknowledged to be illiterate. A fund is set up
to spend the proceeds of a national lottery on celebrating the millennium,
but no one, not even the minister in charge, has articulated a clear idea of
what that means, or what there is to celebrate. At a conference of the
governing party, a yob makes a successful bid for the front pages by lifting
his kilt for the cameras.
We affect to be shocked, but our sensibilities are numbed. Nothing is
sacred, least of all religion. There is some tut-tutting when a clergyman is
dismissed for professing a lack of belief in God. Several of our television
comedians appear to be motivated by a militant, even spiteful, atheism. The
end of deference may be welcome, but in its place has come - a void. We
revel in titillating accounts of the sexual misdemeanours of this or that
government minister and affect surprise when we hear that various officials,
elected and appointed, appear to have been lining their own pockets, or
allowing their relatives to do so. We live in the kingdom of Grab, an empty
commonwealth in which, when financial fiddles are revealed, some wonder
whether the misdemeanour lies in the act, or the getting caught.
In such a world, prattle about whether the monarchy will survive the war of
the royal books is mere escapism. Prince Charles and Princess Diana have
been subsumed into the production line of the media; they have become its
primary raw material, second only to paper. They are the prince and princess
of publishing. Their original image, that of the shyly spooning couple, was
a romantic fiction in the preparation of which they connived. They are now
assisting in the manufacture of the salacious prose that may diminish or
possibly even destroy one or both of them.
Does it matter? At the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth last
week the senior minister at our dining-table was asked what he made of it
all. 'You are addressing the wrong person,' came the reply. 'I give little
thought to these things. All we need to know is that most voters are
monarchists. Nearly all of them hold the Queen in high regard. End of
story.'
Mr John Major concurs. 'I think the monarchy has got its roots sunk so deep
in the affairs of the people of this country that it is very sound and
secure,' the prime minister said yesterday. His confidence is supported by
precedent. Two centuries have passed since James Gillray's caricatures
savagely attacked the extravagance and promiscuous behaviour of the
'voluptuary', the then Prince of Wales. The crown survived. Nearly 60 years
have flown by since the abdication of Edward VIII was forced upon him when
he declared his intention of marrying Mrs Wallis Simpson, the American
divorcee. His niece is still on the throne.
There is no constitutional reason why the Queen's eldest son should not
succeed her. That he shall do so is, as it happens, the essence of the
British constitution. The Prince's qualification for the job is that he is
of his mother born. His private behaviour is irrelevant. This is not a
change of mind on my part. I have long advocated the setting up of a federal
republic of Britain, on the ground that the executive hides behind 'crown
prerogative' as an excuse for misgovernment. Hanging everything on the tag
of the supposed royal command is a licence to print honours, a permit for
the exercise of patronage.
Yet I would cheerfully salute the accession of Prince Charles if the throne
were first to become detached from the executive, made contractually
subservient to the people, and defined in a written constitution. It might
then usefully be slimmed down, becoming a 'bicycle monarchy' as in northern
Europe. It would certainly benefit from a period of reticence about itself,
as the Duke of Edinburgh intimated yesterday. In such clearly-defined
circumstances, the role of an hereditary king as a focus of loyalty to the
nation - that is, of all of us to one another - could as well be fulfilled
by Prince Charles as anyone. Better that, as they said at the recent Liberal
Democrat conference in Brighton, than President Tebbit or, heaven help us,
President Thatcher.
Meanwhile Queen Elizabeth II is more likely than not to reign well into the
next century. The first queen bearing her name ruled during a flowering of
English culture; hers were years of national glory. The second Elizabeth,
possessed of few powers, has been less fortunate. She has been able to
reign, but not rule. She has been steadfast and dutiful, but her governments
have not covered themselves in glory. They have left the nation uncertain
about whether it belongs to the continent to which it is attached.
As a nuclear power and permanent member of the security council, Britain
retains the vestiges of its 'great' past, but lacks the self-confidence to
participate wholeheartedly in the affairs of the European Union. We cling to
illusory 'certainties', such as 'sovereignty' and the idealised Victorian
royal family. We know that reality lies elsewhere. Some - perhaps most - of
us cannot bear the knowledge. To get through the night, we tune in to
'Charles and Di,' and go back to sleep.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Labour reform plans for royal family prompt Tory outrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is drawing up a comprehensive constitutional reform package that
would cut the cost of the royal family and prevent ministers from using the
antiquated rules of crown privilege to bypass parliament.
The proposals prompted outrage from senior ministers, many of whom believe
the Conservatives would win a general election fought on constitutional
issues such as the role of the monarchy and the UK's place in Europe.
Labour's proposals, which will be given a preliminary airing tonight in a
BBC Panorama documentary on the monarchy, are being drawn up by a Commission
on Democracy that will report to the party's 1995 conference.
Initial attention is likely to focus on Labour's proposals for a big
reduction in the number of royals carrying out official functions, heralding
a smaller monarchy along Scandinavian lines.
However, the commission is also considering fundamental changes to the
sovereign's residual executive powers, most of which are in practice
exercised by ministers.
The powers include appointment of officials without reference to parliament,
making foreign treaties and binding regulations by executive order, and
exempting government activities from the law.
The democracy commission is also considering the practical implications of
Labour's plans to abolish the right of hereditary peers to vote in the House
of Lords, and to set up assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the English
regions.
It will also confirm Labour's plans for fixed parliaments and propose a new
bill of rights.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, accused Labour leaders of
'trying to placate their leftwing activists with constitutional reform -
downgrading the monarchy, splitting up the UK, subordinating Britain in
Europe.'
However, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, said Labour was
contributing to a national debate prompted by public disgust at the
government's failure to uphold high standards of public behaviour.

FT  02 JUL 94 / How we elect the king: Tony Benn explains how the
constitution should be used to give Britons the right to choose, through the
ballot box, their head of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BENN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British constitution, contrary to what is widely believed, is not an
unwritten one but is written down in detail in a network of personal oaths
of allegiance which are imposed on everyone who exercises any responsibility
in the state and binds them, individually, to the crown.
All MPs, peers, mayors, judges, officers, police officers and many others
are required to take such an oath.
Privy councillors, who include all cabinet ministers, have a special and
secret oath administered binding them even more tightly to the crown.
Bishops are required to pay homage to the crown and accept that the monarch
is the only source of 'ecclesiastical, spiritual and temporal power', while
at the coronation the only oath that the Queen gives is to defend the
protestant religion and uphold the rights of the bishops.
The monarchy actually consists of three separate and interlocking parts.
The first, and most public, is to be found in the person of the king or
queen. The Queen has a high profile and symbolises the nation in the minds
of the people, ever present and presiding over parliament and government but
nowadays possessing very few personal powers.
The real powers of the crown are exercised by the prime minister using the
royal prerogatives. These confer an immense amount of patronage, including
the power to make and unmake ministers, appoint peers and thousands of
public officials.
They also include the power to go to war and sign treaties, without the
consent of parliament, and it is under the prerogative power of
treaty-making that all the laws assented to by British ministers in Brussels
gain their legitimacy and override any domestic legislation that might
conflict with them.
The third and most mysterious aspect of the monarchy lies in the existence
of the crown as a legal fiction, for example, when members of the security
services are placed under a lifetime obligation of confidentiality to the
crown, which is a licence for them to do what they like without regard to
the law and then to keep quiet about it, making them a state within a state.
This structure dates back hundreds of years and the only real change came
recently - and from an unexpected source - British entry into the European
Union.
Under the Maastricht Treaty provisions, the Queen and Prince Charles have
become citizens of this union, reducing them to the same level as the rest
of us. Within the European Union, as it moves towards federalism, it is
obvious that many more public officials will be required to transfer their
personal allegiance to the union, as British commissioners have already had
to do.
All these aspects of a monarchical system of government are carefully
concealed beneath the public face of the king or queen of the day. Any
criticism of the system has been fended off by presenting it as an unfair
attack upon the person of the monarch.
So successful has this technique been that it is almost impossible for any
serious discussion to take place on how we might wish to be governed
Some time ago I introduced a Commonwealth of Britain bill which would give
the country a new and democratic constitution providing, among other things,
for the election of a president and disestablishment of the Church of
England.
This bill received a great deal of attention and is on the reading list for
some universities, but the problem has always been the method by which the
process of reform could be started.
For many years I have been working on a method that would make this
possible, intending to disclose it when the throne became vacant, and this
is how I realised that it could be done.
When a sovereign dies or abdicates the successor has to be proclaimed king
or queen and that proclamation, which is then read out in public in various
parts of the country, is the legal basis upon which the new monarch rests
for his or her authority.
This proclamation is agreed at a meeting of the Privy Council, held at St
James's Palace, and the key words in it are as follows:
'We, therefore . . . do now, hereby, with one voice and consent of tongue
and heart publish and proclaim . . .'
This proclamation is then signed by all those present.
There could hardly be a clearer or more precise legal statement of the
requirement of unanimity - and it is virtually identical with the same
principle which applies in the Council of Ministers of the European Union
when the president of the commission has to be appointed.
A few days ago, the prime minister was vigorously defending his use of that
unanimity rule to block the appointment of the Belgian prime minister and
this was one of the reasons why I decided to make my proposal public, by
writing to the Lord President of the Council.
The other reason for doing so was the decision of the Prince of Wales to
recommend the disestablishment of the Church of England, which I have long
advocated, and which would have the most profound constitutional
implications.
If the proclamation of the Prince of Wales as king can be delayed by one
privy councillor registering an objection, then the matter would have to be
referred back to parliament, as it was in 1688 when parliament offered the
throne to William III.
My purpose in all this is very simple and straightforward and involves no
personal criticism of the Prince of Wales.
It is to offer this country a chance to adopt a democratic constitution that
would give everyone the right to choose, through the ballot box, their head
of state and both houses of parliament, as happens in every modern
democracy.
It is my conviction that the problems that face Britain can only be tackled
if we throw off the shackles of feudalism and start to have confidence in
ourselves.

FT  01 JUL 94 / Floated on a royal wave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We Republicans for Charles are right. Most of the opinions expressed by the
Prince of Wales are sound. As the founder and to date sole member of R4C, I
can say that we agree with nearly every word he said in his self-promotional
film on Wednesday night.
Not about his private life. That is none of your business, or mine. The
public life of the heir apparent is what concerns us. The charities he
supports are admirable. Their beneficiaries are found in all sections of
Britain's ethnically mixed population. Indeed, the Prince projected himself
as the opposite of a nationalistic little Englander. He would have no place
in the xenophobic wing of the Conservative party. The respect he showed for
other faiths, including Catholicism, Judaism and Islam, is in tune with his
affirmation that there is a spiritual dimension to life.
He may or may not be a Tory, but he appears to be of the one-nation
persuasion. He is right about the ugliness of much contemporary
architecture. He is a Green, and a believer in civic virtue. Like many of
us, he thinks that some form of national service, not necessarily military,
should be re-introduced. This could be a winner. Rootless, jobless school
leavers have to be found something constructive to do.
Clearly, Charles is running for king. His theme is the return of quality to
British life. Lovely platform; shame about the office. This is the point
upon which Mr Jonathan Dimbleby failed to press the Prince. I am too kind.
'Failed to press' be blowed. The younger Dimbleby dodged the key question.
He might have have put it softly thus: should the British monarchy be
privatised, sir? Not abolished. There is no call for that. Turning the
dynasty into the independent Palace Trust would suffice. As purchaser of
head of state services the government could award a contract to this or that
hereditary institution to become sole provider. There might be competitive
tendering. Other European or more far-flung royal houses would be qualified
to bid. The monopoly should be regulated, by Ofthrone. Lord St John of
Fawsley would be an ideal choice for First Regulator.
Don't mock. The arbitrary use of the royal prerogative by ministers and
civil servants is no joke. It constitutes a fatal flaw at the centre of the
British non-constitution. To put it right, the crown must be detached from
the letterhead under which the executive does as it pleases. Let royalty be
a living flag for all to salute, not a fig-leaf for an elective
dictatorship. This is a serious constitutional proposal. Arguments for,
against and around it will be found in Power and the Throne, a forthcoming
book arising out of the debate on the monarchy organised by the Times and
Charter 88 last year*.
As Lady Williams, the former Shirley, puts it, 'the executive in Britain has
something very close to absolute power; it hides behind the Crown as a way
of hiding from us the extent of that power'. Let us list the areas in which
such power is exercised. The result is breathtaking. Under the royal
prerogative ministers may conclude treaties, move interest rates, appoint
anyone they please to any public position they like, award honours and
peerages, manage the civil service, and fill endless volumes with delegated
legislation, all without requiring prior approval from parliament. Most of
the real deciding is done by officials.
The courts act as an uncertain brake upon the exercise of this huge quantity
of authority. Prince Charles intimated in his film that he finds it
difficult to influence the Home Office or the Foreign Office, let alone the
Treasury or other departments. Yet all of them take thousands of decisions
every year, under cover of his mother's name, and free of any check or
balance.
Change may come. Mr Jack Straw, campaign manager for Mr Tony Blair in the
Labour leadership contest, favours a new Act of Settlement. That would
reposition the Crown within the British polity. 'We should aim for a
situation where all powers exercised by the executive, and by the monarch,
are based upon statute, sometimes . . . reinforced by direct decisions of
the electorate through referenda,' he writes. Mr Straw's ideas are not
always taken up by his party. Labour is, however, committed to a number of
constitutional reforms, all of which would diminish the power of the central
executive. Give Scotland its own parliament. Entrench local government. Pass
a bill of rights and a freedom of information act. Replace the House of
Lords by a senate. These little things add up. Suddenly you have constrained
Whitehall.
The Prince of Wales was not asked about these matters, but it cannot be
taken for granted that he would oppose all or indeed any of them. He might
well support some, if only his interlocutor had the wit to inquire. His
desire to be sworn in as defender of all religions rather than the church
founded by Henry VIII for concupiscent reasons suggests a willingness to be
separated from at least one of Britain's constitutional arrangements. Good.
But the monarch is one thing, disestablishment quite another. The prince
could be defender of the spiritual life and bishops could still sit in the
Lords, if that is the way we chose to arrange matters.
Republicans for Charles can therefore claim that the House of Windsor would
benefit from becoming semi-detached. The monarchy is in difficulties because
it is under intolerable pressure. In my hot-headed youth I was an
uncompromising republican (Ofhead), but I have since been persuaded that in
Britain there is merit in the continuity of a floated-off royal house. It is
a fine tourist attraction. On a more elevated plane it serves as a focus for
national sentiment.
Cutting it free from the barnacled substructure of our unwritten
constitution would strengthen it. The occupant of the throne could become a
private person, the essence of nationhood. As Sir John Stokes, former
Conservative MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge, put it: 'It is very important
if you are going to war your oath is to the Queen and not to the . . .
secretary of state for defence . . .' Fine, so long as said secretary of
state derives his authority from the people, and not merely from his
officials' ability to deploy the royal prerogative according to whim.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Radical agenda set for reform
of constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN would no longer have the power to appoint the prime minister under
a programme for radical constitutional change approved by the conference
yesterday.
Delegates voted overwhelmingly for a wide-ranging motion stipulating that
the prime minister should be elected by an overall majority of the House of
Commons. It also called for the abolition of the royal prerogative which
enables the Queen, acting on the advice of her ministers, to declare war or
sign treaties with foreign governments without the prior approval of
parliament.
While postponing to next year a debate on whether the monarchy should be
abolished, the conference voted to change the law governing the right of
succession to the throne. The Liberal Democrats want to allow the eldest
child of the reigning monarch - whether male or female - to succeed to the
throne. Another change approved by the conference would permit a Roman
Catholic to assume the throne.
Calls for the introduction of referendums which would be binding on
parliament were defeated, but delegates agreed that there should be advisory
referendums.
Newly created regional assemblies, local councils and, as at present,
parliament would be able to stage referendums on controversial issues.
Provision was also made for citizens' referendums to be held when called for
by a stipulated number of voters. Other fundamental changes included in the
programme for were:
A new bill of rights entrenched with a written constitution and upheld by a
Supreme Court.
Home rule for Scotland and Wales, and regional assemblies in England. An
elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords representing Britain's
regions and nations.
The reformed chamber to include a minority of unelected non-voting members
chosen to reflect wider expertise and experience.
The introduction of the single transferable vote system of proportional
representation for all elections.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Queen will pay taxes on personal income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN and the Prince of Wales are to pay tax on their personal income
'in the same way as every other taxpayer', Mr John Major announced
yesterday.
For the first time, the sovereign will also be liable for capital gains tax
and inheritance tax, with the important exception that inheritance tax will
not apply to the transfer of assets from the Queen to her successor.
The prime minister emphasised the move was at the Queen's initiative. It was
announced in principle in November after public unease over the cost and
behaviour of the royal family.
Lord Airlie, Lord Chamberlain and head of the Queen's household, said the
move would place a 'considerable additional burden' on the Queen's finances.
He said the Queen had acted to ensure the monarchy developed with the times,
particularly during a period of recession. The recent emphasis on royal
wealth had tended to obscure the Queen's contribution to national life, and
this - not the embarrassing publicity surrounding the Queen's children - had
prompted the change.
Commenting on estimates of her private funds ranging from Pounds 100m to
billions of pounds, Lord Airlie said: 'Her majesty has authorised me to say
that even the lowest of these estimates is grossly overstated.'
The prospect of a continental European-style monarchy appears to have
receded. Lord Airlie said the additional costs could 'be met without
compromising the standards and style which are expected of the Queen'. Tory
MPs urged that the change should not amount to a 'cut-price' sovereign.
The new arrangements, set out in a memorandum between the Queen and the
government, follow months of talks between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue
and the Royal Household.
In his Commons statement, Mr Major said the exact tax figures would be kept
secret, but tax would be levied initially at 25 per cent and later at 40 per
cent on the income the Queen used for private purposes.
The arrangements on inheritance tax disturbed some MPs. But Mr Major said
they were needed to protect the monarchy from the risk of the sovereign's
assets being 'salami-sliced' through successive generations.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Bulgaria backs ex-communists and king: The political revival
of two rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOFIA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP), successor to what was once the eastern
European communist party most loyal to Moscow, is expected to return to
power after general elections this weekend. If so, it will join similar
parties in Lithuania, Poland and Hungary which revived like Lazarus from
what was widely assumed to be death after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
But an equally miraculous revival has been taking place at the opposite end
of the political spectrum - a surge in popular enthusiasm for the idea of
monarchy in general and for the exiled monarch, ex-King Simeon the Second,
in particular.
The popularity of the king has been rising since the downfall of Todor
Zhivkov, the old communist dictator, in 1989. Even President Zhelyu Zhelev,
a former dissident, who used to be the most popular politician in Bulgaria,
recently came behind King Simeon in public opinion polls.
The 57-year-old king, who lives in Madrid, is widely considered to be closer
to restoration as a modern constitutional monarch than any other exiled
royal claimant in the former communist world. Many of the 49 political
organisations contesting the election have sought to capitalise on the
popular longing for 'a good and just king'.
The socialists have not been able to ride the monarchist chariot for
ideological reasons. But political rivals claim the BSP has secretly
inspired monarchist organisations to register for the election to prevent
them joining the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the main anti-communist
coalition. Every vote diverted from the UDF serves the BSP cause.
In 1991, most royalists voted for the UDF after King Simeon appealed to
Bulgarians to vote for the 'democratic forces'. This was interpreted as
support for the UDF, although the king refused to urge anyone to vote for a
particular party. Dispersion of pro-monarchist votes, meanwhile, meant that
none of the divided monarchist groups managed to clear the 4 per cent hurdle
needed to enter parliament.
This weekend's early elections result from the refusal of both the BSP and
the UDF to replace the outgoing non-party government of technocrats. This
was led by an academic, Mr Lyuben Berov, but supported by the BSP. It
resigned last September after successfully renegotiating Bulgaria's Dollars
9.3bn (Pounds 5.7bn) foreign debt.
This time around the UDF has failed to attract more than a few of the
smaller pro-monarchist clubs to join its election campaign and has found it
hard to attract pro-monarchist and pro-republican voters. The UDF has
pledged to contest the 1946 referendum which abolished the monarchy, but has
not come out in favour of a restoration.
King Simeon has urged the monarchist groups to unite. But political
infighting and personal power struggles have left voters to decide between
seven big monarchist groups and many smaller monarchist clubs.
All that unites the groups is a desire for restoration of the old Turnovo
constitution. The king's supporters say he is still the monarch as there was
no formal abdication. The royal family was forced to leave Bulgaria when
Simeon was just nine years old after a rigged plebiscite under the new
communist rulers.
This abolished the monarchy in 1946, although the Turnovo constitution, with
the monarchy as head of state, was not changed at the time. On reaching his
18th birthday, Simeon of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was proclaimed King of the
Bulgarians under the Turnovo constitution.
Opinion polls suggest that more and more Bulgarians see restoration of the
monarchy as a guarantee of stability. Royalists also argue that monarchy
could help build a barrier against further ethnic tensions in the Balkans.
Politicians, eager to seize more power in elections, are more prone to
manipulating ethnic minorities than a monarch capable of rising above such
calculations, they say.
In an interview, King Simeon said that he could provide the country with
'unity, national reconciliation and a sense of recovered dignity'.
The ex-king does not rule out the possibility of co-existence of
constitutional monarchy with a socialist government. But analysts in Sofia
doubt that the monarch could be brought closer to the throne if the polls
are accurate and the politically disciplined BSP defeats the divided
monarchist and anti-communist forces.
The latter outnumber the socialists by a big majority, but have proved
unable as yet to forge the alliances needed to keep the socialists out of
power or put the king back on his throne.

FT  10 DEC 93 / On a wing and a prayer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England, established by law, gains no advantage in Heaven from
its association with the Crown of the United Kingdom. I discerned this by
listening to Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, then Bishop of Masasi, some 30
years ago. His concern, while we walked together in the hot African dust,
was the salvation of mankind as an act of worship of God, not a free pass to
visit the prime minister or the Queen.
Since those heady days I have been a consistent disestablishmentarian. The
case for separating the British state from its official church is best
argued on its merits. These have been considerable since . . . let us say
since attendance at public worship ceased to be compulsory. In a week in
which parliament has ceded the sabbath to Mammon, by allowing virtually
unrestricted shopping on the seventh day, the case seems overwhelming.
Christian ayatollahs may have been in the ascendancy in a quasi-theocratic
state when Queen Elizabeth I assumed the title of Supreme Governor of the
church, but that was nearly half a millennium ago. Queen Elizabeth II may
well be the last to hold this purely nominal office.
None of the above has anything to do with the personal life of the Prince of
Wales. That is an after-dinner topic - unavoidable, but not serious. It is a
phase through which we must all pass before growing up. The national mind
has been drugged by the ingestion of too many tabloids. Give me a lightly
grilled sole, a little spinach and a Havana of reasonable purity and length,
and after devouring the first two I'll puff on the third while competing in
scurrility with everyone else. But that is an abuse of the spirit. Even a
long-standing agnostic like myself cannot be proud of it. We should focus on
the church.
First, let me clear away one further, more fundamental, distraction. I have
argued here before that the British polity would be healthier if the formal
apex of power was the will of the people, protected by a declaration in a
written constitution. That would remove the opportunity open to the
executive to abuse its authority by affecting to act on behalf of the
monarch. Thus democratised, the head of state could continue to wear a
crown, if that is what the populace wanted. This topic, like royal
behaviour, should be detached from the thread of the argument about
disestablishment.
Pause a moment, to tick off what I hope is agreed so far. There is only one
heir to the throne. He is Prince Charles. End of story, although not the end
of gossip. There are many churches, mosques and synagogues in Britain; only
one has been so bound by history in seductive ermine that it is unable to
concentrate on its true religious function, for fear of disconnection from
the political process. Some of its ministers register near panic at the
prospect of being reduced to the status of priests in a minority Christian
sect.
These long-standing fears must be felt all the more acutely at present.
Financial mismanagement has diminished the Church of England's earthly
riches, and obliged its parish clergy to scratch around ever more piteously
for fresh sources of support. The decision to permit women to become priests
has split the church. Some recalcitrants are running off to Rome while
others stay behind in miserable defiance, or plain confusion. An explosive
debate about disestablishment could damage this fragmented church beyond
repair.
We disentanglers can wait. Granted, the present may not be an ideal moment.
Yet the truth is that separation of church and state is proceeding in the
usual English way: by fits and starts. The prime minister, acting on behalf
of the Queen, appoints the bishops - but does so from a short list prepared
by the church. The House of Commons, in which heathens appear to be the
majority, votes on matters such as the ordination of women - but follows the
general synod of the church. The next monarch may be 'defender of the faith'
but not 'supreme governor'. It is progress, but we are still stuck with 26
Anglican bishops in the House of Lords.
None of this changes the essence of the case. That is best put as a
question. At a time when many people, particularly young people, are
searching longingly for spiritual guidance, what on earth are the Anglican
disciples of Jesus Christ doing in their centuries-long embrace with the
descendants of Caesar? Surely not merely preserving their position? It may
be that in the coming century the vacuum left by the materialism of the 20th
is filled by institutions other than the Church of England. True believers,
rising above institutional concerns, should welcome that.
A more enduring future may lie in store for the world-wide Anglican
communion, whose member churches were founded by missionaries who risked
their lives to preach the gospel, or by British settlers in what became the
white Commonwealth, or by America's Episcopalians. There are Anglicans in
India, and in Japan, and of course in the Church of the Province of South
Africa. Most of the world's 70m Anglicans are black Africans. This
international community would be strengthened if its mother church ceased to
be part of the British state. The opposite view is expressed by Michael
De-la-Noy, press officer to the archbishop of Canterbury in 1967-70. In his
recent book, The Church of England (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 16.99), Mr
De-la-Noy notes that establishment 'provides links with the Foreign Office,
so essential to the Church's dealings with governments overseas'. He must be
right about the institution, but could be wrong about its purpose.
It would be naive to insist that that purpose, which is in essence to
sustain a transcendental view of the universe, can only be served by
volunteers uniting in worship. The influence of both Islam and Christianity
was expanded by the sword. Crusades - and, we must hope, jihads - are,
however, a thing of the past. The task, for some exalted individual, some
doctrine, some institution is to find 21st century ways of keeping human
faith alive. Lambeth Palace, which sits across the Thames in
mock-equilibrium with the Palace of Westminster, does not seem a likely
source of such inspiration. The original 12 disciples would have found the
link incomprehensible. The C of E should float free. It might then save
itself and - who knows? - some of the rest of us.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Crowning glory for the last of his line: Russia's harassed
president will meet Queen Elizabeth II today / A look at the royal visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Queen Elizabeth meets Mr Boris Yeltsin, on her first state visit to
Russia which starts today, she will be greeting a man who is certainly the
last of his line. No future president of Russia will be a former member of
the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
Mr Yeltsin has fought hard to avoid the fate of being 'the Queen of
England', as the decorative presidency to which the former Supreme Soviet of
Russia wished to confine him was popularly known in Russian political
circles.
But in that struggle, which reached its climax a year ago, he exhausted
himself, unable now to muster the consistent energy needed to build
institutions of democracy. That leaves him occupying one of the most
powerful presidential chairs in the world without the appetite or will to
use its power in a way which will fully meet the challenges which press on
him.
From the Queen's point of view, the timing of the publication of Prince
Charles's authorised biography has cast an unfortunate shadow over the
beginning of her visit. That is not the only potential embarrassment. The
last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, and the Tsarina Alexandra, both close
relatives of the Queen's grandfather George V, were killed on Lenin's
personal orders.
Mr Yeltsin, in his Bolshevik period, levelled the house in Ekaterinburg
where the Tsar's family met their deaths, in order to remove its potential
as a shrine and presumably to advance his career.
The bodies were buried in roadside graves from which they were exhumed only
after the end of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: they have not yet
been reburied, though are due to be, in the Peter and Paul Fortress in
Petersburg, which the Queen will visit.
The last Russian royal family is thus unlikely to come up as a subject of
conversation between the toasts.
Mr Charles Anson, the Queen's press secretary, said yesterday the issue had
been discussed at diplomatic level but 'the question of the reburial of the
Russian royal family and the Queen's visit are entirely separate issues'.
Though President Yeltsin has made at different times before different
audiences denunciations of communism and has apologised directly to the
Japanese for Soviet treatment of their prisoners of war, he has not alluded
publicly to the circumstances of the Tsar's death. Russia is not and perhaps
cannot be a penitent nation as Germany has been.
The British royal house also has a historical black spot which may inhibit
it from pressing the matter. King George V, a man who professed Nicholas II
to be a close friend as well as a relative and so like him physically as to
seem in photographs more a twin than a cousin, personally refused the Tsar's
family visas.
Professor Dominic Lieven, in his biography of Nicholas, says 'the King
 .took the lead in closing off the possibilities of asylum ..fearful of
reaction from British socialists and the labour movement, King George did
not want his dynasty to be associated in the public eye with the hated and
now fallen Russian Tsar, let alone with his half-English wife.'
Awkwardness of a different kind now attends Queen Elizabeth II as she, a
British monarch, comes to Russia for the first time. Still, the visit of
western Europe's most prominent constitutional monarch serves the purpose of
highlighting President Yeltsin's crowning achievement.
Like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him, he has realised, in what has been, for
both men, the greatest test of their erratic but high courage, that it is
not possible to take refuge for any length of time in the mailed fist.
The process which Mr Yeltsin inherited from Mr Gorbachev roars on; he rules
over it a little more than the Queen rules over her kingdom, but not much.

FT  02 JUL 94 / The defence case for the crown: Prince Charles took his
message to his future subjects - but has it fallen on sympathetic ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Charles has just found safe haven aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia,
anchored, possibly for the last time, in the Pool of London. It is 100 years
since his great-great-grandfather opened Tower Bridge and the present heir
to the throne has returned from the anniversary celebrations. 'At least I
didn't fall in', he chuckles, acknowledging the potential for more,
extraordinary headlines.
The news media have already given saturation coverage to the previous
night's television documentary in which, before an audience of 13m, he
confessed his adultery, mused on the links between church and crown and
conformed to his own caricature as a thoughtful man trapped by destiny but
compelled to prove his worth.
If the avalanche of publicity and 'expert' opinion had rattled him, the
prince who remains calm under fire (witness the little contretemps with a
pistol-waving student in Sydney's Tumbalong Park) was showing no signs of it
aboard the yacht whose fate at least has been decreed.
Any Lord of the Isles who can prang his 'whisper' jet into a Scottish peat
bog as he did this week, adjust his cufflinks and stick to his schedule is
not going to be shot down by a press he says is hooked on 'prurient
speculation'.
On Britannia, where he urges his guests to 'make the best of it', he is
relaxed, smiles through a healthy tan and shows no hint of what a supportive
Bishop of Durham was this week moved to describe as a 'sinful and struggling
man'.
Immediately ahead of Charles lies a low-key weekend in Wales - today he
visits a Rhondda rugby club - to celebrate 25 years as Prince of Wales. He
knew the anniversary would trigger renewed questioning about his suitability
to be the next king and, in a risky move, decided to present his own case on
film. He has no regrets about the final product and knows that, for the most
part, it will merely endorse the views of those who oppose or support him.
The prince hopes that when the brouhaha over his infidelity has died down,
people will be left with a rounded impression of a man doing his best for
'jolly old Britain' in a job he would not have chosen but which he must
ensure changes with the times.
But while the documentary, with its exhaustive, intimate exposure of a man
who loves every tree and stone but who imagines each one conceals a
tele-photo lens, may have been designed as a definitive response to the
critics, it has inevitably raised as many questions as it has answered.
If the exercise was regarded as an important step in the campaign to restore
his badly-damaged public image and reinforce his claim to be crowned King
Charles III, did it help or hinder him?.
His readiness to be grilled on the most intimate and painful aspects of his
life, like some disgraced Hollywood giant seeking renewed adulation through
abject confession, at once renewed the controversy over whether the British
monarchy's best chance of survival lies in retaining some mystique or in
riding bicycles in St James's Park.
Prince Charles' view is self-evident from his decision to make the
programme. 'Who are all these people who speak for me?', he despaired on
camera. The best response, he decided, was to do his own talking. 'There is
no sense it has backfired. He's said what he wanted to say and he won't be
doing it again', an aide volunteered.
Many would welcome a long silence. 'I'm for a little bit more mystery
surrounding the royal family', says Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the
Institute of Directors. 'I think is it extraordinary that we know much more
about Prince Charles than we do about Margaret Thatcher.'
'Ridiculous decision', claims a senior Tory peer: 'The publicity surrounding
the family's problems was all dying down anyhow and he has re-ignited it. He
said himself we have no right to know everything and he should never have
been exposed in that way.'
His Lordship may be out of touch. Early polls suggest that the prince's
decision to bare all has gone down quite well with the general public, which
is still in favour of a monarchy and which does not appear unduly worried
about having an adulterer on the throne. The Daily Mirror's front-page
banner headline - 'Poll Exclusive - Not Fit to Reign' - omitted to mention
that though one-third of its readership believed Charles should be denied
the crown, two-thirds said he should be king.
His personal performance has won support even among some republicans: 'If we
must have a monarch, then I suppose there is nothing wrong with a rather
curious, inquiring screwball doing the job. If we have to have one, then
let's have him', says Prof Richard Hoggart, the author and historian who
believes monarchy perpetrates patronage, sentimentality and contempt. He
adds: 'It is all based on the idea that you must give the little people
something to wave at. But I accept that the great bulk of the public still
want to press on with a monarchy.'
Prof Hoggart, who refuses invitations to Buckingham Palace, thinks Charles
has managed to project himself as a 'dignified, well-intentioned human being
who is not an intellectual but has a lively, intelligent mind'.
Helena Kennedy, QC, chancellor of Oxford Brookes University and an advocate
of constitutional change, agrees with Prof Hoggart that the British public
is not unduly perturbed by the fact that the prince's marriage has broken up
and that he has been unfaithful.
'People increasingly see the royal family as just another family, with all
the usual failings and frailties. Charles, at least, is much more in touch
with the real world than some of his relations. If this was a relaunch, I
think it has been successful'.
The prince's television performance did not dispel the idea that Charles
still inhabits a world alien to most people. Perhaps it is not unreasonable
that when the Colonel in Chief of eight regiments sits down to dinner at
home with a few old chums they should be clad in enough gold braid to sink
Britannia but it hardly carries the common touch. His use of 'boiling' as an
expletive reeked more of Bertie Wooster than Brookside.
However he may be singing a more popular tune in thinking out loud on the
future relationship between church and state, and the possibility of
widening the remit of monarch to become defender of all faiths. Senior
palace aides insist he is not advocating disestablishment of the Anglican
church.
According to Ms Kennedy: 'He is clearly struggling with things spiritual and
temporal in a way which many people will understand.'
The Anglican church has mostly been cautious in responding both to the
prince's disclosures over his personal behaviour and his thoughts on the
future role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.
Lord Coggan, former archbishop of Canterbury, is not alone in pointing out
that Charles would not be the first royal to sin and still ascend to the
throne.
But regular critics of the royal family such as Rev Tony Higton, a member of
the Church of England's ruling synod, is more convinced than ever that
Charles is not up to the job. He believes the prince's views on defending
the faith of Catholics, Hindus and Zoroastrians alike will be profoundly
disturbing to many: 'He is a New Ager rather than a Christian and he is
unprepared to be Defender of the Faith,' says Higton.
The IoD's Peter Morgan adds: 'It is one thing to be clearly identified with
your own faith and to open up to others but quite another if you are not
going to be identified, first and foremost, with your own church. The prince
speaks warmly of Islam but can we really expect King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to
become leader of all the faiths in his country?'
In the view of people such as Mr Anthony Barnett, co-ordinator of Charter
88, the group seeking constitutional reform, the prince's anguished
deliberations form a sideshow to the real agenda for change in Britain.
'Charles' objective is to try to resolve the crisis of the monarchy by
attempting to say I love this country, I can't understand why its going
wrong and I'm trying to do what I can to make it better.
'The real problem is not the prince's behaviour. The crisis is not just
institutional but also lies in our failure to maintain consistent, economic
development. The monarchy used to be the authentic representative of a very
successful political, social and economic order. All that has gone. Now it
is the symbol of a rotten, decayed constitutional order.'
Mr Barnett paints Prince Charles as a man now almost entirely isolated from
any of the surviving institutions: 'He is so alone. There is no real
aristocracy, an ineffective church, the army is a poor imitation of what it
once was. They have all dropped away, leaving the monarchy increasingly
adrift.'
Charles himself invariably portrays himself, still more so since his split
with Princess Diana, as a man struggling alone - despite his staff of 62 -
to carry the burden imposed by destiny; the reality is that he remains,
possibly for many years to come, only the deputy. In the meantime, he will
continue his duties for what he so tellingly calls 'the organisation' into
which he was born. He rejects any suggestions that he is somehow trying to
re-define his role but acknowledges the need to make subtle shifts which
will help make him a thoroughly modern monarch. Few people criticise the
prince's involvement in and encouragement for the range of organisations
aimed at extending opportunity to those needing a helping hand. Even fewer
will criticise the unique ability of someone, by virtue of their
extraordinary position, to bang together ministerial heads and painlessly
extract more cash out of a parsimonious government.
He is ready for more 'ghastly' command performances but he also desperately
wants people to realise there is a substance and sense of deep obligation
underpinning his life.
'I am not', says the Prince of Wales, 'very good at being a performing
monkey'. The years ahead will decide whether his subjects-to-be will
ultimately permit him any other role.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Private lives, public heirs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Prince and Princess of Wales are to live
separately raises more questions about the future of the British monarchy
than it answers. In essence, it says that since nothing will change except
the living arrangements of the heir to the throne and his wife the couple
should now be left in peace. This is not convincing. Everything will change,
and the prince and princess will continue, however regrettably, to be the
focus of attention.
The statement, issued by Buckingham Palace and read in the House of Commons
by the prime minister, might prove conclusive in a country in which there
was no established church, no popular demand for a family to represent the
crown, no insatiable public thirst for information about all aspects of
royal life and no antiquated structure of law and tradition. Britain is not
such a country. The monarch is head of the Church of England, the Queen is
revered as head of a family, the media reflect public tastes and the essence
of royalty is tradition.
When the time comes for Prince Charles to ascend the throne his putative
subjects may find it difficult to understand how a man who lives separately
from his wife can become head of the church that bears his country's name.
The Archbishop of Canterbury was quoted in aid by the palace yesterday, but
that does not necessarily end the matter.
Like the monarchy, the established church depends for its existence upon the
support of its adherents. Because it is established, there is a sense in
which the two institutions sink or swim together. There is a balance to be
struck between maintaining strict rules of personal conduct and accepting
that social morality has changed. It is not clear that either palace - the
archbishop's or the Queen's - has yet got it right.
Family life
During most of the present century the British people have demanded of their
sovereigns that they symbolise traditional family life. It was because he
could not do so that the Queen's uncle was obliged to abdicate in 1937. The
Duke of Windsor's sin was that he proposed to marry a divorced woman. At
that time such a move was unacceptable to both church and state. It might
not be so today. Yet the highly publicised marital difficulties of the
present Queen's children have unfortunately damaged what Bagehot referred to
as the 'dignified' part of the constitution.
The proposition put forward yesterday that somehow this separated couple can
become King and Queen as if nothing untoward had happened does little to
repair that damage. It is difficult to imagine life under what would be two
thrones, sitting back to back, facing opposite directions.
Sensational stories
The strength of royalty is a matter of perception; if people do not believe
that what they think they see is worthy of respect the monarchy is devalued.
The increasingly intrusive tabloid press, followed closely by television and
some of the broadsheets, has not served the royal family well. An industry
has been created around a single product: sensational stories about royal
persons.
This is a sad comment on an unsavoury aspect of contemporary life. Yet no
industry can exist without customers. If people did not want to read such
stuff, and pay to do so, it would not be produced. The market for palace
scandals is a keen one. Against such harsh reality, the call in parliament
yesterday for a moratorium on stories about the prince and princess sounds
forlorn.
It is therefore possible that the British constitution, which exists in the
mind rather than on paper, will suffer from further destabilisation when the
Queen's reign comes to an end. She has conducted herself with great dignity
and composure over the past 40 years, and would serve her country well if
she could continue for many more decades.
But, in spite of Mr John Major's plea for silent acceptance of yesterday's
news, it cannot now be said that the succession is predictable. For a
constitutional monarchy, it is not a disaster that there should be debate
about the implications of the announcement and the changes in social context
and expectations which form its background. At all events, such a debate is
now inescapable.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Charred, not changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the great fire of Windsor the talk of London and elsewhere was that
Britain's royal family was on the skids. If that was so last week, then it
still is today, despite the flames that dominated the weekend news. If the
prospect last Thursday was that Prince Charles would never become king, it
is the same this Tuesday morning. A charred national monument will make no
difference, however glorious the original may have been. Hampton Court was
gutted by fire six years ago; since then, coincidentally, its occasional
inhabitants have been the victims of incessant crescendos of public
disrespect.
Hold on. This is not a prediction that a revolution is around the corner.
The establishment of a federal republic of Britain would be a remarkable
constitutional advance, but the odds in favour of any such development are
slight. Yet they are not zero. None of us really knows what the heir
apparent has on his mind. Gossip suggests that he is fed up, that he might
try to have the crown passed over his head to his son's. If he does so the
whole institution will probably crumble. Only a brave or unintentionally
destructive dauphin would risk that.
The dramatic flames of the weekend have put such speculation on hold, at
least for a day or two. It is natural to express sympathy for the Queen, as
seen on TV bravely surveying the conflagration in her raincoat. No one who
fails to make the appropriate noises will be regarded as a gentleman.
Certainly Her Majesty is held in greater public esteem than any other member
of her family. While she reigns, the institution is secure. What may come
after her is less predictable. This is not because the monarchy is costly,
although if it was privatised and managed as a tourist attraction, as it
should be, a strong finance director would doubtless find much fat to trim.
You would then be well advised to take shares in Royal Attractions plc. It
could be a far better bet than Euro Disney.
The fact that the Queen pays no tax, even on her private investment
portfolio, does rankle with a great many people. Some Labour MPs, notably
those on the public accounts committee, miss no chance of reminding us of
her tax-free status. Perhaps that is why we have been reading stories about
the prime minister negotiating a new fiscal concordat with the palace.
Monarchists must hope that he is successful. He should be. There is no case
for the Queen withholding the tax she should pay on her considerable
personal fortune. This is a simple problem of equity, which in theory can
easily be resolved.
It is harder to prescribe an antidote for the de-mystifying effect of our
national obsession with the private lives, or the imagined private lives, of
the supposedly dignified element of the constitution. It is not the Queen's
fault that the private behaviour of some members of her family is similar to
that of many of her subjects. The House of Windsor is not the product of a
long line of saints; its forebears were human, and therefore imperfect. The
damage that has recently been done to its reputation is not the consequence
of any change in royal behaviour, but rather the result of a change in the
level of intrusive salacity the public will accept from - indeed demand of -
the media that serves it.
If none of these concerns existed there would be near-unanimous support for
the decision, affirmed by Mr Peter Brooke yesterday, to finance the
restoration of Windsor Castle from public funds. The heritage secretary has
logic on his side. The building belongs to us taxpayers. We have maintained
them since 1831. The monarchy is irrelevant to this argument. Even if we
lived in a republic this valued historic monument would be maintained by the
public purse.
As it is, provided we turn up at the right time we may see most parts of it,
including some of the burned-out area - although you may need an invitation
to a state banquet to get into the grander state rooms. Those who argue that
Windsor Castle should be subject to normal planning permission and fire
regulations have a point. But that is a red herring. The cry of 'let the
Queen pay' is not rational, although strongly felt. It means 'let the Queen
pay taxes'.
There is no general cry for what is really needed, which is the
disestablishment of the monarchy. British democracy would be less stultified
if it was disconnected from the process of government. The Crown sits at the
apex of our unwritten constitution. It puts the lid on the glass jar inside
which sit the suffocating elements of a Britain that should be long past: an
over-powerful executive (thankfully rather hamstrung for the moment); a
tradition of secrecy in the name of the Crown; a tendency for ministers to
make arbitrary decisions; an obsession with maintaining the unitary
structure of the United Kingdom. Every milligram of ash at Windsor Castle is
a small national tragedy; a bonfire of the constitutional nonsense that
rests on the House of Windsor would be a huge national triumph.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Experts deny royal reports threaten Crown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
REPORTS in the British media of difficulties in the marriage of the Prince
and Princess of Wales do not pose any constitutional crisis for the
monarchy, constitutional experts said yesterday.
Lord St John of Fawsley, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said that
the allegations published in The Sunday Times about the marriage, based on
Diana: Her True Story, a book by Andrew Morton, 'cast a shadow over the
monarchy and must be very upsetting for the Queen'. But, he added, 'they
have no effect on the role of the Queen or the role of the Prince of Wales'.
Lord St John said that if the prince and princess divorced, it would have no
effect on the succession. Other constitutional experts agreed.
Lord St John said: 'The role of the royal family as exemplar of family life
and values would be diminished, but there would be no practical effect on
the succession. Divorce is very widespread and accepted.'
In his book Mr Morton claims that Princess Diana attempted to commit suicide
during the 1980s. The book details conversations with friends of the
princess who say her marriage is a sham and that she is convinced she will
never become queen.
Buckingham Palace would not comment on the allegations yesterday.
A spokesman said yesterday that the Princess of Wales had not co-operated
over Mr Morton's book 'in any way whatsoever' and she had not seen the
proofs.
'As far as we are concer-ned it's business as usual. They both have official
engagements today which they will be fulfilling.'
He denied that, in the wake of the divorce of the Princess Royal and the
recent separation of the Duke and Duchess of York, the Palace's failure to
refute the allegations was fuelling a constitutional crisis.
'What constitutional crisis? There is no constitutional crisis,' he said.
He added that it was pointless to speculate about the effect of a divorce of
the Prince and Princess of Wales, because that was a purely hypothetical
situation.
Mr Brian Hanson, legal officer of the General Synod of the Church of
England, confirmed that the Prince of Wales could divorce and still succeed
to the throne with the title of Supreme Governor of the Church. He said:
'The only fetter on the heir to the throne is becoming a Roman Catholic or
marrying a Roman Catholic. In theory a divorce would be possible.'
Lord St John said damage to the monarchy caused by the book would be
limited.
Most of the events described in it and reported by the weekend press took
place in the early 1980s and were out of date. The feeling of the British
people was mostly against the press and not against the royal family.
'I am not worried about the future of the monarchy as a result of this,'
Lord St John said. 'Perhaps it will lead people to take a more realistic
view of the monarchy as ordinary people with ordinary problems.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / Bicycle ride to a revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long relative decline of Britain will continue until there is a
revolution. What kind of revolution? One answer is given by Professor
Stephen Haseler in a new book entitled The End of the House of Windsor -
Birth of a British Republic*. Our author is professor of government at
Guildhall University, London. 'The dawning truth about Britain in the
post-war period,' he writes, 'is that the country seems to be running out of
options. We have tried virtually every strategy for survival.'
Yes, yes, but what kind of revolution? Well, actually, a cultural
revolution. Back to the professor. ' . . . Our culture - the way we think,
the way we talk, the values we live by, indeed 'the British way of life' -
no longer allows us to compete effectively in the modern commercial world.'
As he sees it, the way to change the culture is by reform of our governing
institutions and indeed the constitution itself. Turning our monarchy into a
republic would certainly achieve that. 'My argument here', writes Professor
Haseler, 'is that, over time, new attitudes and aspirations would follow.'
Ordinarily, none of this would matter. It could be dismissed as academic
pub-talk. Maybe it still can. But it is possible that the professor is
pulling at a loose thread of indeterminate length. His book appears at a
moment when the competence of the government is more deeply in doubt than at
any time since 1945. That would be bad enough, but the opposition is divided
and its largest component, the Labour party, presently inspires little
confidence. We are heading towards a mid-1990s election in which the choice
before us may be between competing B-teams. This is frustrating. It has not
led to marches behind republican banners, but the political atmosphere is
becoming more hospitable to those who propound systemic reforms.
So is the social climate. The behaviour of some of the royal children has
eroded loyalties that once seemed beyond question. The Queen herself remains
popular. Her position is, deservedly, secure. What comes after her is,
however, unpredictable. Visitors to Britain do not have to move very far
from the airport to discover that the House of Windsor faces an uncertain
future. Just pick up any newspaper, or look out for a clutch of books - some
published, some about to be - that seek to catch the tide built up by the
tittle-tattle of the tabloids. Professor Haseler does not shrink from
exploiting this phenomenon. 'It is fitting,' he writes, 'that the travails
of Diana and Charles's marriage should be the catalyst for major change.'
The same series of events has encouraged The Times, once a rock of
allegiance to the throne, to associate itself with the reformist Charter 88
movement in a forthcoming conference on 'The Monarchy, the Constitution and
the People'. This gathering, due on Saturday, will be addressed by staunch
monarchists, moderate reformers, and Professor Haseler. We should not
conclude that Mr Rupert Murdoch, a suspect republican, is using his posh
London newspaper for nefarious purposes. I wouldn't know anything about
that. The pertinent point is that a journal that carries the court circular
every day is facilitating a debate on the monarchy that 20 or 30 years ago
might have been deemed treasonable. That is how far public opinion has
moved.
It still has a mighty long way to go before there is a republican movement
in Britain. In spite of my dreams of a federal republic in these islands I
would stop well before that, and settle for a Dutch, Belgian or Scandinavian
form of dis-established throne. Professor Haseler dismisses such a solution
as certain to fail. But consider the essence of the argument, his and mine,
in favour of constructing a new British constitution by removing the crown,
the keystone, from the arch of the present antiquated structure.
It is the crown that supports, and is supported by, the anachronistic House
of Lords; the crown in whose name ministers feel able to sign treaties, such
as the one concluded at Maastricht, in the absence of parliamentary
approval; the crown that legitimises the thousand and one decisions made in
the dark corridors of Whitehall every day. Replace its authority with that
of a written constitution, dismiss the House of Lords and elect a senate,
and you have quite enough revolution for the average English family to
stomach.
Europe's little northern monarchies have solved the problem. They do not
have hereditary upper houses of parliament, and their constitutions specify
exactly what their kings and queens may do. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark
has 'supreme authority in all the affairs of the realm', but, as with the
conclusion of treaties, only with the consent of the Folketing. Likewise
Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard of the Netherlands. She may appoint her
prime ministers by decree, but does so on the report of a 'formateur' to the
effect that he or she commands a majority.
No such sliver of ambiguity prevails in Sweden, whose constitution provides
for the speaker of the Riksdag to propose a new prime minister. Government
decisions do not require King Karl XVI Gustaf's signature. King Baudouin of
Belgium has far greater nominal powers (he is the supreme head of the
executive). But in practice he does not exercise them.
British subjects who see the need for reform but insist that the person of a
respected monarch is a focus for national loyalties may thus have their cake
and eat it, simply by learning from the Low Countries and the Scandinavians.
These are in essence republics, in which authority is derived from the
people. For reasons of their own they retain their cycling monarchs. We may
have to do the same. Perhaps the Union Jack is not an adequate substitute
for a crowned head, as the stars and stripes are in the US, or the abstract
notion of the state is in France. Perhaps our revolution, when it comes, has
to stop short.
The chances of this happening are becoming real. The Labour party's
proposals for constitutional reform say little about the monarchy, but if
the other parts are enacted, the rest will surely follow. We may be in for
permanent Conservative government, but this seems doubtful. One day an
electable, reforming, alternative will be on offer. With any luck, the
British polity will then become like that of Italy a year or so ago:
pregnant with sudden change.

OBSCURE KINGDOMS
by Edward Fox
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 16.99, 240 pages
In this stylish, informative and sometimes very funny book, American-born
journalist Edward Fox recounts his personal pilgrimage to five of the
world's remoter monarchies. He went because he wished to understand what
makes kings and kingdoms tick. His travels took him to Tonga, Oman, Nigeria,
Swaziland and Java. In each he had fascinating and sometimes hilarious
adventures, related in a dry and sharply observant prose which signals the
arrival, in this first book, of a major writing talent.
Fox turned his back on European royalties because he wished to encounter
monarchy afresh, in unfamiliar guises. But he repeatedly found himself 'face
to face with what I was fleeing: the hand of the British, recreating the
empire in their own image.' Were it not for the British none of these
monarchies would be as they are; most would not even exist.
Tonga's King Tupou IV granted Fox an audience, and during it demonstrated a
simplified method of addition for use in primary schools. The King not only
invents things - a joint rugby and soccer goal post, used all over Tonga, is
another example - but conducts agricultural experiments, solves
archaeological problems, and is the holder of his kingdom's pole-vault
record. He is the fattest man in Tonga because he eats the most, a sign of
royal power. It is clear that Fox, although bemused by Tupou, enjoyed
meeting him, and learned an important lesson: that delays and difficulties
are occupational hazards of royalty-watching.
It was much more difficult for Fox to get at His Majesty the Sultan of Oman,
an absolute monarch in the traditional oriental mould. He succeeded in
attending a levee at which subjects queue to shake the Sultan's hand; but
requests for an interview were denied, and when Fox tried to observe the
Sultan on his annual meet-the-people tour, in a Bedouin-style cavalcade with
Mercedes Benzes substituting for camels, he failed. So instead he read the
history of Oman and the 'mirrors for princes' written to instruct rulers,
and pondered on the fact that 'roads and roundabouts are the distinctive
post-oil Arabian art form', explained perhaps by the fact that they
represent an 'ultimate triumph over the former hardships of desert travel'.
Fox did not come away unimpressed; when he went to shake the Sultan's hand
it was in a throne-room that looked like the inside of a gigantic Faberge
egg.
After difficulties of Oman Fox found Nigeria a joy, because it has not one
but hundreds of kings and he was able to interview a number of them - the
Aragbiji of Irigbiji, the Akirun of Ikirun, and even the two greatest
'obas', the Alaafin of Oyo and the Ooni of Ife. In Yoruba religion Ife is
the site of Creation. The exact spot, Fox reports, lies opposite a Total
petrol station, marked by an enigmatic granite pillar. Each oba is a
guardian of the traditional religion. For those who are now Moslem or
Christian this presents difficulties. To become an oba one has to eat the
dried heart of one's predecessor, served in soup. But the benefits, it
seems, usually outweigh scruples; on meeting an oba one says 'Kabiyesi]'
which can either be translated 'May you live long' or 'You cannot be
contradicted'.
Heartened by his successes in Nigeria Fox proceeded to Swaziland, only to be
disappointed again. Young King Mswati III proved unmeetable, hidden behind
layers of suspicious advisers. Fox noted a mysterious empathy between the
Swazis and the British: 'They saw a bit of themselves in each other. Each
had a culture of clenched good manners, restraint, discipline,
understatement and secrecy, arranged in a strict social hierarchy with a
King at the top.' The Swazis have a saying: 'Let the Swazi and the English
deceive each other with politeness, and the Zulu and the Boer have it out
with clubs.'
But all frustrations were compensated in Java, where Fox had a satisfying
encounter with Sultan Hamengkubuwono X of Yogyakarta, whose full name runs
to two dozen words. Here Fox was able to meditate on the secret of monarchy:
its place between the secular and divine, its use of the mysteries of
inaccessibility, its function as a centre for artistic display, political
patronage, and symbolic meanings. It is a privilege of royalty to be
unavailable when it chooses; in Nigeria an oba's henchmen would turn away
petitioners by saying his master was still abed. 'These kings were like
disappointing zoo animals,' Fox remarks, 'always asleep when you wanted to
see them.'
The author of this highly entertaining mixture of travelogue, history and
royal essay appears as a wryly engaging observer. One looks forward to his
next book with great relish.

<TEXT>
   Britain today celebrated the 300th anniversary of
the bloodless Glorious Revolution that established its democracy
and brought to the throne William and Mary, who founded the royally
chartered American college.
   About 1,500 people filled the Palace of Westminster, seat of the
British Parliament, for a ceremony celebrating the world's most
enduring constitutional monarchy.
   Among the guests were a U.S. delegation from the College of
William and Mary in Virginia, led by former Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger.
   They were joined by Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Prince William of Orange, heir to the Dutch throne, a
Dutch parliamentary delegation and speakers of many of the
parliaments of Commonwealth countries.
   The ceremony recalled the 17th century abdication of King James
II, the last of England's absolute monarchs, and the arrival from
the Netherlands of William and Mary, who were enthroned as
constitutional monarchs ruling under Parliament.
   William, invited by dissident noblemen to replace James, sailed
to England with 300 ships and 15,000 soldiers.
   The Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights that followed in
1689 ``transformed the relationship between the crown and
Parliament. They secured our liberties,'' said Bernard Weatherill,
speaker of the House of Commons, in his address.
   Queen Elizabeth, in her address, said William's accession to the
throne with Mary ``ended almost a century of constitutional turmoil
and uncertainty in the two kingdoms'' of England and Scotland.
   It meant, the queen said, that ``the successive swings between
the arbitrary rule of the king and arbitrary rule of parliament
became intolerable.''
   Some historians argue that the Glorious Revolution entrenched
the rule of the British upper classes and led to the repression of
Catholics under Protestant William's reign.
   Paul R. Verkuil, president of the College of William and Mary,
said in an interview that the controversy ``has not been exported''
to the United States.
   ``For us, the Glorious Revolution is pure and simple, the
precursor of our own revolution. It is truly an important event for
us,'' he said.
   The college, whose chancellor is Burger, was founded in 1693 at
the behest of William and Mary. Congress, with President Reagan's
assent, designated it to represent the United States at today's
ceremony.

FT  08 FEB 92 / The tourist in her own country: As the Queen enters the
fifth decade of her reign, the monarchy faces challenges greater than ever
before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CANNADINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS KING Lear discovered unhappily, longevity does not necessarily make a
sovereign popular or serene. Indeed, if Queen Elizabeth II contemplates the
history of her forebears on the British throne, she must see that the record
during the past 200 years or so has been decidedly mixed.
Although she is well-loved by her subjects, it does not follow automatically
that the monarchy's reputation is high and unquestioned. Certainly, age by
itself will not assure her of greater dignity and public respect: as old
men, George IV and William IV were neither loved nor admired, while Edward
VIII threw it all away when he married Mrs Simpson.
Yet, the reasons why some monarchs have become venerated patriarchs (or
matriarchs) while others have not are complex and often obscure. George
III's reputation improved immeasurably the older (and madder) he became. At
the end of her reign, Victoria was even more selfish, obstinate and bigoted
than she had been at the start; but none of this mattered to her subjects,
who worshipped her as an imperial icon. Edward VII was scarcely a more
admirable individual than George IV, but the public perception of him was
very different. And while George V became a lovable king, he was never a
particularly lovable man.
So, at one level, royal reputation turns out to be like any other: what
Shakespeare once described as 'an idle and most false disposition, oft got
without merit and lost without deserving.' But it is fashioned also by
broader forces over which the monarchs themselves have had little control
and often have not even understood. In every reign, and in every generation,
the British have projected on to the person of their sovereign their own
collective hopes, anxieties and expectations. In so doing, they have created
and re-created their monarchy in their own self-image.
How far should the Queen be comforted or worried by this as she enters the
fifth decade of her reign? Compared with George IV or William IV she has
enjoyed a relatively good press. Compared with George V and George VI, she
has done rather less well. And compared with George III and Victoria, she
did much better at the beginning of her reign but seems less likely to enjoy
the sunset apotheosis and uncritical veneration of their later years.
Why so? As in previous ages, the answer lies in a combination of individual
royal personality and the broader tissue of national circumstances. In a
society where old age is more a commonplace problem than an unusual sign of
admirable endurance, it no longer guarantees certain celebrity in the way it
once did - witness the almost Pythonesque demise of the Kremlin old guard.
To make matters worse for the present Queen, the slot of apotheosised
matriarch is not yet even available to her. Indeed, if the Queen Mother
outlives her own century, as she seems to have every intention (and
capability) of doing, that slot is not going to become available for many
years.
As to her own personality, we know little more about it now than we did at
the beginning of her reign, despite the BBC's televised attempt on Thursday
to make her more accessible. Like her father, she is reputedly pleasant,
decent, dutiful, conscientious and high-minded. But, like him again, she is
also limited in her education and her social vision, seems lacking
conspicuously in imagination and flair, and is conservative enough to regard
most change as change for the worse. Whether these are the ideal attributes
and attitudes for a head of state in the late-20th century is, perhaps, open
to question.
And then there is her family. As the Queen surveys the tribe of which she is
the hereditary chief, she must often shudder, and it is difficult not to
feel some sympathy. When she acceded to the throne, the royal family
consisted effectively of five people: the Queen herself, her husband, her
sister, her mother and her grandmother (Queen Mary). But during the past 40
years it has developed into an over-extended, multi-generational dynasty,
devoid of any central direction, purpose or justification.
For most contemporary commentators, whose analysis is scarcely more profound
than that of the gossip columnist or the 'investigative journalist,' this is
enough to explain the unhappy state and uncertain prospects of the monarchy
today. But while individual character, the reaction between the generations,
and the creative image of the royal family undoubtedly are important, they
are only part - and perhaps the lesser part - of the whole picture. Now, as
in the past, the monarchy must be viewed in the broader context of national
development and the popular collective mood.
At the time of her Silver Jubilee in 1977, Elizabeth II was anxious to
stress that she had been crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland: that she was, like her forebears, a symbol of
British national identity. But in the course of her reign, that sense of
national identity has much weakened. Scotland wants devolution, Northern
Ireland will surely rejoin the south before the next century is many years
old, and England itself is now a multi-racial society. Where exactly does
that leave the monarchy as the traditional embodiment of Britishness?
A closely-connected subject, which also has important implications for the
monarchy's future, is the fast-changing relations with Europe. It is not
just that the Queen's head might disappear from UK bank-notes, coins, even
postage stamps - it also is difficult to envisage a serious role for
Britain's royal house in any tighter form of continental federation. What
would the British monarchy do then?
In previous times, it could have turned to the Empire or the Commonwealth to
keep it busy. But the independence of the former colonies, and the changing
identities of the old dominions, mean that the Commonwealth is no longer the
royalist, Anglophile community it was at the Queen's accession. Yet, it is
only as the sovereign of her remaining overseas possessions, and as head of
the Commonwealth, that she can lay claim to a genuinely global role. She
herself believes passionately in it - but few others do. It will not last.
Shorn of its international trappings, how would - or will - the monarchy
adjust?
As the British nation itself is re-defined; as Britain's relations with
Europe are re-ordered; as the once-British Commonwealth evolves and
disperses; and as Britain gradually - and painfully - adjusts to the fact
that it is no longer a world power, this is bound to require a fundamental
re-thinking of the monarchy's purpose and functions. The old way of doing
things - ceremonial grandeur, tax exemptions, overseas tours, gracious
smiles - which may have been right at the outset of the Queen's reign, no
longer seem acceptable or appropriate. What is to be put in its place?
This has been made all the more urgent because of the impact of Thatcherism
on popular perceptions of the monarchy. As a symbol of national identity,
Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, upstaged the Queen easily.
Norman Tebbitt, perhaps Thatcher's closest lieutenant, denounced the Prince
of Wales and many Thatcherites regarded the monarchy as just another vested
interest, an unacceptable amalgam of snobbery and frivolity. While the
welfare state consensus prevailed, the monarchy's position as benevolent
referee seemed clear and secure. But now the goal-posts have been shifted,
its position seems decidedly shaken.
There is little evidence that the Queen, or her relatives and advisers, have
recognised the full implications of these developments so far as the
monarchy is concerned. And it is here that we must return to personalities
again. Clearly, there is need for a serious re-evaluation of the monarchy in
the next few decades. Whether the present queen - 40 years in the job and,
thus, hardly likely to change her approach to it - is the person to
undertake such a re-appraisal is not clear. Nor can we know whether Prince
Charles, her heir, would - or will - do any better.
Whoever is responsible, part of the process of the readjustment ought to
involve the dismantling of the old, out-of-date imperial monarchy that
flourished from the time of Victoria's Golden Jubilee until the present
Queen's accession. The tax exemptions, the ceremonial grandeur, the
Commonwealth tours, the endless public appearances, the whole sycophantic
mythology of imperial ornamentality - all this needs to be scaled down or
swept away, and the monarchy brought into line more appropriately with the
diminished nation over which it now reigns.
Described like this, the royal future might seem rather unappealing: a moped
monarchy which is little more than an hereditary, non-elective presidency.
But while the monarchy would be well advised to abandon its recent imperial
past, its lengthy history affords other more positive and encouraging
precedents. It does not have to be like it is: passive, philistine,
bewildered, anachronistic, obsessed with protocol and tradition, and
smothered in a courtly embrace redolent of quarter-deck attitudes and
saddle-soap.
Previous monarchs have been lively, energetic, cultured, even intellectual:
what a refreshing change it would be for that to happen again. Previous
monarchs did much more than make an occasional visit to a concert or the
opera and were involved, actively and creatively, in the promotion and
patronage of the arts: that, too, would be a welcome development. The
present Queen might follow the example of George I and use a small part of
her enormous fortune to found some new university professorships. She might
even set up a Windsor foundation and establish herself as a leader in
creative philanthropy.
The real problem with the British monarchy today is that it is not seen to
be an active, serious or significant part of the life of the British nation.
Doing her boxes, going on stage-managed visits, making speeches she has not
written, meeting people only in wholly-contrived social situations - none of
this brings the Queen into authentic contact with her subjects. Like all
members of the royal family, only more so, she is little more than a tourist
in her own country. If the British monarchy is to have a future, she should
think about taking up residence for real.
These individual suggestions can take us only so far. It is not just that
the British monarchy has lost its way - it is also that the British people
no longer have any real collective sense of what they want their monarchy
for. Just as most societies get the gods they deserve, so most monarchies
get the sovereign they deserve. One reason why the British are so uncertain
with their monarchy is that they are so uncertain about themselves. For both
the Queen and her subjects, there are challenging times ahead.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Monarchy targeted in Benn proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONING off the royal family, disestablishing the Church of England and
abolishing the House of Lords were proposed by Mr Tony Benn yesterday in an
attempt to push the case for republicanism after the Queen's self-confessed
'annus horribilis'.
The Labour MP for Chesterfield's Commonwealth of Britain Bill was presented
to the Commons for the second time with its author able to claim that one
provision was already in place: the prime minister has announced that the
Queen will pay income tax from next year.
Mr Benn said that if the Maastricht treaty was ratified, the Queen's status
would be further undermined. She would, in effect, become a citizen of
Europe, able to vote in European elections. It would make a further mockery
of Britain's constitution based on 'a network of oaths of allegiance,' he
said.
Mr Benn - an opponent of Maastricht - said that 'to have an oath of
allegiance to another citizen in a European union is quite a big change,
much bigger than I'm proposing.'
He first presented the bill in the last parliament, when it was not even
discussed by MPs. But Mr Benn said it has provoked debate and had become a
set text for some students.
Moreover, in the past few weeks, with the separation of the Prince and
Princess of Wales, 'the magic and mystery' had disappeared from the
monarchy. His bill proposes the transfer of royal palaces to the state and
stripping all power from the monarch but giving her a state pension and
accommodation.
Mr Benn's bill would set up a House of Commons and a House of the People.
There would be an elected president, national parliaments for England,
Scotland and Wales, and a charter of rights. Britain would withdraw from
Northern Ireland.
The bill is extremely unlikely to be debated.

<TEXT>
   On a continent where kings were once
revered as gods, Asia's half-dozen surviving monarchies include a
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute
power.
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, the world's longest reigning
monarch following the death Jan. 7 of Japan's Emperor Hirohito, has
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design
irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.
   Aside from Thailand and Japan, monarchs also reign in Nepal and
Bhutan in the Himalayias, Brunei on Borneo, and Malaysia in
Southeast Asia.
   Unlike his remote predecessors in Nepal, Harvard-educated King
Birendra criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year
2000.
   In the kingdom of Bhutan, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk pores over
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions
submitted by subjects.
   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held Feb. 24, is widely credited
with having helped Japan's postwar economic miracle by preserving
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.
But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after Japan's
defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the
Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of Tokyo's Imperial Palace.
   His son and successor, Emperor Akihito, 55, broke with tradition
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his
fellow Japanese at numerous public functions.
   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between
emperor and subjects, Akihito is unlikely to interact as intimately
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian
royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.
   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining
hereditary monarchs is Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, an absolute
ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200
horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the United
States last year named him the world's richest man, with assets
estimated at $25 billion.
   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet
to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of Maryland on
the north coast of Borneo island.
   Brunei's sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,
maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of Asia as its
rice fields.
   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist
revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western
democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.
   The last emperor of China abdicated in 1912. Communists ended
imperial rule in Vietnam at the end of World War II. India's
independence from Great Britain in 1947 sounded the knell for
myriads of royals. Cambodia's kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in
1970, though Prince Norodom Sihanouk, formerly the king, is still
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of
Afghanistan, Mohammad Zaher Shah, was toppled in 1973 and is exiled
in Italy but recently offered to help in a transitional government
in his country.
   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms and
Malaysia, where every five years one of the country's sultans is
elected a constitutional monarch.
   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have sultans who are constitutional
heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of
themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but
political power rests with prime minister.
   The present king of Malaysia is Sultan Mahmood Iskandar from
Jahore state. His term expires this year.
   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable
futures appear secure.
   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600
years in Japan. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as
figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's
oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor
its continuation.
   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in Thailand, is heir to
750 years of monarchy.
   Bolkiah is Brunei's 29th ruler while Nepal and Bhutan both have
centuries-old royal traditions.
   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is
regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that
have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious
student-led uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of national
crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.
   Named king in 1946 and crowned four years later, when he was a
jazz-loving teen-ager, Bhumibol was initially viewed as someone to
be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the
decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite
to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.
   Nepal's Birendra, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural
poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable
sources in Nepal and neighboring India say much of the effort is
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an
open secret in Katmandu, the capital.
   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited
democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the
Hindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.
   In Bhutan, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk has continued his father's attempts at political evolution
and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate
people.
   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and our
values is equally important,'' Jigme Singye has said.
   Bhutan was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his
reform-minded father.
   International aid agencies have been welcomed to Bhutan but mass
tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways
upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like
``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four
sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.
   Brunei's politics are said to be among the most sterile in Asia
but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant
signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of
$21,000 is among the highest in the world.
   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other
investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is
credited with a number of civic improvements.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Queen will start to pay income tax from April: Decision seen
as move towards a smaller, European-style monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEEN ELIZABETH II has heralded the most sweeping reform of the British
monarchy since her accession 40 years ago by agreeing to pay income tax and
to support financially all but three members of her family.
Her decision amounts to a move towards a smaller continental European-style
monarchy. It was announced by Mr John Major just two days after the Queen
hinted that she recognised public dissatisfaction over the cost - and
behaviour - of her family. The prime minister said the move came at her
initiative.
The Queen is said to be the richest woman in the world with investments
alone estimated at Pounds 50m. From next April she will pay tax on her
private income at the 40 per cent top rate. She will probably also pay
inheritance and capital gains tax - but under arrangements still to be
decided because normally her wealth could be wiped out on her death.
Discussions are taking place between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and
the Royal Household before a fuller statement early next year. The Prince of
Wales is likely to pay more tax on income from the Duchy of Cornwall. After
escaping paying the poll tax, the Queen will pay the council tax on her
Sandringham and Balmoral homes.
From next year only the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh
will be paid incomes out of the 'civil list' voted by parliament. At present
the Queen receives Pounds 7.9m, the Queen Mother Pounds 643,000 and the Duke
of Edinburgh Pounds 359,000 from the civil list.
The salaries drawn by five other members of the royal family will be
reimbursed to the public purse. Buckingham Palace said the five - the
Queen's three younger children, her sister Princess Margaret, and her
90-year-old aunt Princess Alice - will go on performing public duties.
Although the Inland Revenue will keep details of royal finances secret, as
for any taxpayer, and even though taxes were paid by Queen Victoria, George
V and Edward VII, the move marks a watershed for the monarchy.
It was seen at Westminster as an attempt to restore the monarchy's
reputation after, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis dominated by
rumours about royal marriages and rows over its extravagance. The political
debate over who should pay to restore the fire-damaged Windsor Castle may
have led to the changes being announced.
Moreover, the Queen, in whose name the Inland Revenue collects taxes has
become liable herself. Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, said she could
have created an extra 25 jobs for tax inspectors at the Inland Revenue's
high-security unit in Cardiff.
The announcement came in pre-scripted exchanges in the Commons between Mr
Major and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who had been briefed on Tuesday.
Mr Smith asked the prime minister if, 'in view of the evident public
concern', he had had discussions with the Queen about her finances.
Mr Major replied that 'affection and respect' for the monarch were
widespread and the sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her personal
income. 'But Her Majesty some months ago, before the summer recess,
indicated to me that she wished consideration to be given to changing these
arrangements.'
The Queen will not be taxed on sums voted by MPs to cover costs of items
such as royal flights and trains, which totalled Pounds 57m last year. But
she will pay tax on private income from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Prince
of Wales already pays tax on his private income and voluntarily contributes
25 per cent of income from the Duchy of Cornwall.

FT  09 JUL 94 / Do we want religious toleration?: Truth of the Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidei Defensor. Defender of the Faith. It has the chivalrous ring of
authentic heritage. Even these new-fangled decimal coins with their angular
shapes and banal names are lent a spurious air of history.
A 20p piece. Huh] Where is our golden ducat, our crown, half-crown or
florin? Where our angel or our guinea? Where is our sovereign? Even the
humble shilling had its history. Fidei Defensor lends a kind of continuity
to the currency between Henry VIII and Charles III. But does it mean
anything?
The faith Henry was defending was the unreformed Roman Catholic Christianity
of the early 16th century. He published a tirade against the Protestant
Christianity which was sweeping through northern Europe and won the Pope's
accolade.
Since, frankly, it has been something of an embarrassment for the head of
the Church of England, which so staunchly rejects Papal claims. Most people
assume it means the duty of the sovereign to defend the established church.
In these more liberal and ecumenical days, of course, The Faith no longer
means the doctrines of one particular Christian denomination. It is far more
likely to mean Christianity as opposed to the 'other faiths' - Islam or
Judaism or Buddhism.
But the future Charles III now wants to broaden the scope of Fidei Defensor
still further to embrace all religious faiths. Defender of Religion is his
preferred role.
The sentiment is fine, well-tuned to the liberal tolerant society we would
like to become. But what, in practice, can it mean?
Parliament can make laws against religious or racial discrimination or -
possibly - against blasphemy (which are incidentally difficult to enforce),
but what can a single person with a royal role do to 'defend' all religions
with conviction and impartiality?
Elizabeth II, our present monarch (may her reign be long and glorious) has
not taken a notably active role in defending the Christian faith of the
Church of England against its enemies, internal or external. True, she sets
a good example by going to church.
However, Elizabeth I was far more pro-active. A doughty scholar and
theologian, she was well up to rebuking prelates in public or preachers in
mid-oration. We are used to smooth prevarication about contentious issues;
Elizabeth would have been robust in her comments on the ordination of women
and forthright with Dr David Jenkins. She would have been scathing, no
doubt, with 'Jews and Infidels'.
Such royal intolerance would be intolerable today. But is tolerance what we
want in Britain? Do we want our head of state to be tolerant of a religion
which demeans and oppresses women? Or one which inflicts 'cruel and
inhumane' punishments in defiance of a UN Declaration of Human Rights? Or
one which issues fatwahs against a British citizen and forces him into
hiding?
Secular humanism is a kind of faith; so is Scientology. Roll up all Moonies.
I wonder what Fidei Defensor could do in Northern Ireland? The essence of
many faiths is their claim to exclusive truth and hostility to other faiths.
How will Religionis Defensor cope with that?
For religions are not like ice creams, different flavours for different
tastes. We may hope for a time - it is centuries away I fear - when there
will be sufficient convergence in the self-understanding of the great faith
traditions for tolerance without compromise to be a real possibility. As
things are, there are seemingly unbridgeable gulfs of both belief and
practice and a growing paranoid fundamentalism.
For the leaders of the different faith communities to have 'access' to the
Crown, as Prince Charles suggests, would no doubt signal publicly that they
are here to stay. But that could be arranged tomorrow by suitable
invitations and no implicit comment on their relative acceptability need be
inferred.
The Establishment of the Church of England is a rather different matter. The
Queen is also 'head of the church', but establishment reaches in intricate
ways into many other areas of public life, into the law and parliament and
education and on into our common rites of passage and the parochial system.
Arguably the crown could abandon that title without unpicking the whole
complex interweaving of church and state.
But if the object of the exercise is to declare an intention to defend the
free exercise of religion in our society she should be doing that as a
matter of principle as head of the church. For the Church of England is
theologically committed to religious toleration; our own Bishops have
frequently been eloquent advocates for the rights of other faith
communities.
In Northern Ireland the Church of Ireland has struggled to bridge the gap
between Roman Catholic and Protestant communities. As head of the church the
Crown is no less free to be the advocate of other communities than it is of
the Church of England.
Disestablishment offers no extra freedom of action to the crown. It is
arguable that it offers the church more than it offers the state -
principally visible freedom to choose and appoint its own bishops and deans.
On the other side it is likely to weaken the monarchy by cutting the last
vestiges of sacral legitimation which the coronation and all the great state
rituals in Westminster Abbey and St Paul's still symbolise for a majority of
the British people.
Messing about with the currency, or the Royal Mail, is deeply unpopular
because, at a gut level, people feel they are organic to our national
identity - veins and arteries to our connectedness. The Queen's head on our
coins and postage stamps says something reassuring to the average person.
Having her as head of the church may serve a similar function - not only for
members of the C of E but for other Christian denominations, other faith
communities and for the large majority who do not want an atheistic, secular
republic.
As Dr Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, pointed out, the Establishment of the
C of E is a guarantee for Jews as well as for Sikhs and Moslems that the
state is constitutionally committed to safeguard basic spiritual values and
the common moral decencies to which most religious communities subscribe. If
that is the price we have to pay for the humiliating business of having the
prime minister advise the Queen on the appointments of bishops and deans it
is a price I, for one, am willing to pay.
Hugh Dickinson is Dean of Salisbury.

<TEXT>
   Soon after security forces unleashed the
bloodiest crackdown in Nepal's modern history, Bijay Bahadur yanked
a picture of King Birendra from his paint shop wall and threw it in
the attic.
   The same day, he also took a handful of rice from his meager
lunch and placed it on a rectangular metal plate as part of a
ritual to feed the king and his forefathers.
   His actions highlight a contradiction in Nepal, the world's only
Hindu kingdom. The monarchy is losing power in a groundswell for
democracy but, for many people, the king remains a living god.
   Bahadur said he pulled down the portrait because he was angry
with the king for the April 6 crackdown.
   ``It was a matter of respect, which had vanished,'' he said.
   On that day, security forces fired into a crowd of 200,000
protesters calling for democracy. Witnesses said police killed
about 200 people. The government claimed only 10 died.
   While gunfire was still echoing through the city, garment seller
Nima Churing, his wife and their four children gathered under
Birendra's picture, lit incense sticks, filled seven small glasses
with holy water and bowed their heads.
   Churing, who like Bahadur also lives in the narrow-laned
Chatrapati area of Katmandu, repeated the prayers the next morning
as soldiers with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled the curfew-bound
capital.
   ``We have done these prayers all our lives. Our forefathers did
it throughout their lives. How can we stop it?'' asked Churing.
   The belief that the king is a living god was propagated early in
the 18th century when snakes prevented King Pratap Malla from going
to a temple of the Hindu god, Vishnu.
   Court astrologers explained the incident by saying Pratap was
the reincarnation of Vishnu and the holy snakes did not want the
king to pray to himself.
   The tradition continued after Birendra's ancestor Prithvi
Narayan Shah vanquished the Malla dynasty and set up his kingdom,
encompassing most of present-day Nepal, in 1769.
   Even today, many people, especially in remote villages, believe
that seeing the king can wash away their sins.
   But while a majority of Nepal's 17 million people _ 75 percent
of whom are illiterate _ worship the king as a god, the educated
and urban population is tearing itself away from the belief.
   ``When I worship the king, it is an inadvertent reaction of my
psyche,'' said Bahadur. ``But I certainly do not believe that the
king is a god.''
   It was this educated and urban elite that led the seven weeks of
pro-democracy protests that forced Birendra to lift a 29-year ban
on political parties. This week, the king agreed to accept his
kingdom's first opposition-led government in nearly three decades.
   During the demonstrations, slogans and graffiti were directed
against Birendra and the royal family for the first time.
   Birendra was depicted as a weak leader, dominated by his wife,
Aishwarya.
   ``Birendra hides behind the queen's petticoat,'' was one chant
that was often heard. ``Birendra thief, leave the throne,'' was
another.
   Many intellectuals believe members of the royal family are
involved in antique and gold smuggling. Queen Aishwarya is often
referred to as Nepal's Imelda Marcos, a reference to the wife of
the late Philippine president.
   There has been little effort to prove the accusations because
criticizing the royalty is illegal.
   Despite the discontent, political observers and newly legalized
political parties agree that the monarchy will remain intact and
that the king will most likely become a constitutional monarch.
   ``It will be a long time before the institution of the monarchy
goes away. The Nepalese people are not ready to sever a part of
their lives suddenly,'' said former Foreign Minister Dilli Raj
Regmi.
   Arbinda Shrestha, a bank clerk who took part in pro-democracy
demonstrations, calls Birendra ``a symbol of unity.''
   ``My political feelings may be there, but I still want the king
to stay,'' he said.
   Many others support Birendra and blame his Cabinet ministers for
the crackdown and mass arrests.
   ``The king was OK. Only his government was bad,'' said Shiva
Manda, a film magazine reporter.
   The people's feelings are echoed by the Nepali Congress party,
which is to head an interim government, and its junior partner, the
seven-party United Left Front coalition.
   With the front's taking part in the government, Nepal becomes
the only country in the world where communists have joined hands
with a monarchy.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The fairytale crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every so often Britain reveals itself as the land of no logic, nil reason
and nonsense. It is in a flap this week about the constitutional
implications of the decision by the Prince and Princess of Wales to lead
separate lives. Even by English standards this is woolly.
While there is a monarchy there are no constitutional implications arising
from the matrimonial difficulties of the royal family. Someone will succeed
Queen Elizabeth. If it is not Prince Charles, it will be Prince William; if
not the latter, then the next in line. Whoever it is will presumably have
been trained to fulfil the contemporary functions of the office, which are
fourfold. The monarch must support good causes. She or he must create an
atmosphere in which courtiers and the recipients or purchasers of honours
may flatter themselves. The institution must at best enchant and at worst
entertain the populace. Finally, politicians delude themselves that, under
the Crown, they are working within a rational framework.
In theory there should be no questioning of who is to occupy such a
hereditary post. In practice the abdication of 1937 diluted the hereditary
principle. The government sat as a secret court of morals over the monarch
and cast him out. We therefore endure an English muddle. Lineal descent
determines the heir, but his or her personal behaviour must be vetted. The
test changes with time; if, as is to be hoped, the Queen continues in good
health for another decade or more, the fitness of her eldest son to replace
her will be determined by whatever is the prevailing popular opinion in the
early decades of the next century. Constitutional lore will be altered to
suit the moment.
That's it. Once through the hoop, the occupant of the throne serves as a
symbol of continuity and unity, a genuinely useful purpose. In short, the
debate about whether the Princess can be Queen if she is leading a life
separate from her husband is actually about private matters and individual
careers.
There are plenty of real constitutional issues to be discussed, but it is
not the English way to take notice of these. Just two weeks ago Lord Chief
Justice Taylor called for the incorporation of the European Convention on
Human Rights into British law.
'Our ratification of the convention obliges us in the end to accept it,'
said Lord Taylor, 'but our refusal to incorporate means acceptance occurs
only after a decision in Strasbourg, much delay and humiliation.'
Lord Justice Bingham, Master of the Rolls, is of the same mind. You could
hardly imagine two more distinguished advocates of what most proponents of
constitutional reform have long supported. Yet the response of Lord Mackay,
the Lord Chancellor, was a politicians' brush-off. The rest is silence.
This echoes the uncanny stillness that has descended on all genuine
constitutional debate since April 9. On that day the Conservatives were
returned to office for the fourth time in a row. Not surprisingly, they are
great admirers of our constitution. Under it, the Tory party always wins.
For the time being their organised complacency has vanquished even Scottish
nationalism. The party of that name is quiescent. Labour's shadow Scottish
secretary, Mr Tom Clarke, is on sick leave. The Liberal Democrats are
focusing on Bosnia. The stage is thus set for the highly centralised British
government to trumpet its allegiance to subsidiarity in Edinburgh today
without a blush. If anyone was so rude as to ask why the Celts should not
have self-government, the Scottish secretary, Mr Ian Lang, would be ready to
reply. Mr Lang, whose sometimes downbeat public image belies his innate
political verve, would doubtless respond that the Conservatives are
devolving power directly to the people, through opted-out schools, hospitals
and the like. Yes, but the stuffing is being knocked out of that one by the
Treasury's already evident determination to take back the initial bribe
money given to hospital trusts, GP fundholders and grant maintained schools.
That leaves Mr Lang with two further arguments against Scottish devolution.
The first is that it should not come about in order to satisfy European
Community needs; the second that strengthening regions weakens nation-states
which in turn strengthens Brussels. Thinking of this kind sets the seal on
the 'stock-taking' about Scotland promised by John Major before the
election. It is a useful little phrase: 'stock-taking' helps Mr Lang win
arguments, fiscal or otherwise, on his fiefdom's behalf. It won the summit
conference for Edinburgh, on the ground that the Scots must be made to feel
that notice is being taken of them. It may achieve modifications of local
government and parliamentary committee structures.
What it will not change is the constitution. Only a proper crisis would do
that. Nothing that has happened since April 9, including this week's
dramatic end to a fairytale, constitutes such a cataclysm.

<TEXT>
TORY MPs' fears over the constitutional uncertainty created by the
separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales erupted publicly yesterday
with speculation that the royal couple would never become King and Queen,
Ralph Atkins writes.
Many Conservative MPs did not believe the princess should be Queen without a
reconciliation. Some suggested the prince may renounce the throne with his
son, 10-year-old Prince William, eventually succeeding the present Queen.
The government again said there were no constitutional implications of the
decision, which has brought fresh turmoil into the House of Windsor.
Downing Street is deliberately refusing to consider 'hypothetical' scenarios
 -for instance, if the couple were to divorce. That would make it difficult
for Prince Charles to take over the monarch's role as head of the Church of
England.
Privately, cabinet ministers said it was largely up to Buckingham Palace -
rather than MPs - to ensure that the arrangements were workable. Mr John
Major has said there is 'no reason' why the princess should not in due
course become Queen.
The couple will carry out some public engagements together but it was
unclear what would happen, however, if they wanted to start a relationship
with a different partner.
Nor is it certain how a modern monarch, under the scrutiny of the press,
could have a Queen from whom he was formally separated.
Mr John Bowis, Tory MP for Battersea, said: 'There has to be a coming
together or I'm afraid there has to be a skipping of a generation.
'It would be absurd to have two different carriage processions going from
two different parts of London to the coronation and then the King and Queen
going to their own homes afterwards.'
Dame Jill Knight, Tory MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said there was 'a
frisson of concern' in the Commons when Mr Major said the princess could
still become Queen.
'Many people say 'well, even if we skip the Prince and Princess of Wales, we
have another possible King in William'.' A great deal would also depend on
public reaction, Dame Jill said.

   For a country still with a monarchy after more
than a thousand years many Britains are dunces about their kings
and queens, according to a survey released today.
   The Gallup Poll said six out of 10 people interviewed did not
know who won the Battle of Hastings.
   Half of those questioned did not know how many wives King Henry
VIII had.
   Six out of 10 did not know which monarch was beheaded by
parliamentarians, eight in 10 could not name the king in power
during the American revolution and just three people in 10 knew who
would follow Prince Charles to the throne.
   Comments on the poll results said more men than women knew about
the violent aspects of the monarchy, including beheadings and
battles, but more than half the women knew that Queen Elizabeth I
was known as the Virgin Queen while only four men in 10 had the
right answer.
   Of the 917 people across the country were interviewed last month
for the survey, those who displayed the greatest ignorance were in
the 16-to-24 age group. No margin of error was given for the survey.
   The answers:
   Duke William of Normandy defeated King Harold II at Hastings in
1066 and then had himself crowned King William I in Westminster
Abbey. The modern monarchy is dated from William but he was
preceded by 17 Saxon and three Danish monarchs.
   King Henry VIII had six wives. He divorced two, had two
beheaded, one died and one outlived him.
   King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 by parliamentarians led by
Oliver Cromwell.
   King George III was the king when the American colonies defeated
the British and became the United States.
   Prince William, the elder son of Prince Charles, is second in
line to the throne following his father, who is to succeed Queen
Elizabeth II.
   The survey was commissioned by Royal Britain, a permanent London
exhibition about British royal history. The exhibition opened last
year near the Barbican subway station.

<F P=106> [By Ann Eveleth and Farouk Chothia] </F>
  [Text] In a significant hardening of his position, Zulu 
monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini has demanded the "complete 
restoration of the Zulu kingdom" in talks with President F.W. de 
Klerk. Sources close to the hush-hush encounters say the king 
has called for a sovereign Zulu state according to pre-1838 
boundaries. This would encompass all of Natal, including 
kwaZulu, and would stretch from the Drakensberg mountains to the 
sea and from Mozambique to the Umzimvubu River in the south. 
  The demand runs directly contrary to speculation that the 
monarch would adopt a less political role with the imminent 
demise of the kwaZulu homeland, in a bid to secure his position 
under a new dispensation. 
  With the failure this week of the trilateral talks between 
the government, ANC [African National Congress] and Freedom 
Alliance to reach agreement on outstanding constitutional 
issues, the king has lost interest in remaining part of the new 
South Africa, the sources say. 
  Arguing that the new dispensation would herald not only a 
new 
government, but a new state as well, one source noted: "Before 
conquest by Britain, the Zulus were a sovereign nation. Now 
that the British are no longer ruling South Africa, we are not 
obliged to remain part of it." 
  Conspicuously absent from last week's pow-wow between 
Zwelithini and De Klerk was kwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. Buthelezi has clearly begun a strategic retreat from 
the political frontline -- in the hope that an anti-election 
call from his nephew will have wider appeal among Zulus. By 
raising the spectre of a UDF [United Democratic Front]-style 
campaign to boycott elections with the backing of a royal 
decree, Zwelithini has sharpened the battle for his allegiance. 
  The ANC's decision to place its deputy secretary general, 
Jacob Zuma, at the top of its Natal electoral list was in part a 
strategy to win over the king, whom ANC president Nelson Mandela 
last year lauded as the king of all South Africans." But 
efforts by Zuma have so far failed to produce a 
Mandela-Zwelithini indaba [meeting]. Instead, when Zwelithini 
decided to enter the heart of the debate, he arranged for a 
private meeting with De Klerk. 
  Sources say De Klerk went further than Zuma's promise to 
seek 
a constitutional position for the monarch by hinting that a 
post-election arrangement could secure him the constitutional 
monarchy of South Africa. Zwelithini is said to have baulked at 
the suggestion. 
  Said one source: "(Zwelithini) looks over the border at 
Swaziland and Lesotho and says: `They were far smaller than 
(the Zulus) in my grandfather's time and now they have sovereign 
kingdoms. Why should I settle for second best?'" Among 
Zwelithini's representatives in the talks are IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] chief executive officer Joe Matthews and Prince 
Gideon Zulu. The government is represented by Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer and his Foreign Affairs 
colleague, Pik Botha. 
  In the clearest reflection that Zwelithini's demands have 
created a dilemma for the ANC and government alike, Meyer said 
this week in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
interview that the king's demands were tantamount to a call for 
secession. He declined to give details. A few hours later, 
Mandela responded by calling upon the king to meet him rather 
than De Klerk, who would not be in power after elections. 
  ANC sources this week claimed the king had already agreed to 
meet a delegation of its Natal leaders, but that Zuma's absence 
on an overseas visit had delayed the encounter. 
  Given the probability that the IFP will, together with its 
allies, boycott the coming election, the king's move to centre 
stage is a shrewd strategy. Inkatha leader Buthelezi and his 
negotiators have exhausted their options for obtaining 
concessions from the government and the ANC. 
  Now, faced with the task of organising an effective boycott, 
the party is playing its trump card, observers say. The 
exclusion of the word "kwaZulu" from the interim constitution 
has strengthened Buthelezi's argument that the ANC and the 
government cannot be trusted with the fate of the Zulu nation, 
sources say. 
  It is unclear how Zwelithini plans to rule such a kingdom, 
but it is likely that Buthelezi would retain his position as the 
"traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch."

FT  06 DEC 94 / A dangerous battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
You may not believe the passage I am about to cite unless you heard it with
your own ears, but here it is: 'The United Kingdom - the greatest cradle of
culture and academic and scientific and artistic and political achievement
in modern times - that's not some trifle to be lightly set at risk.' This
anachronistic fantasy was purveyed by Mr John Major, in a speech written for
delivery at last Friday's conference of Conservative women. An ancient
mirage of national glory was his product, the flag his packaging. 'It is,'
said the prime minister, referring to the country he runs with such
effortless brilliance, 'the highest cause this party knows - and we will
defend it with every fibre of our being.'
There you have it. England beats Graeco-Roman civilisation into a cocked
hat. The Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Germans, the Egyptians, the
Italians, the Indians, the Persians - oh, why bother to list them, they are
all foreign, and they have nothing to teach the British. Music, painting,
philosophy, science, the very act of learning were all invented here. There
is a certain sadness in the vainglorious, grandiloquent rodomontade with
which some of our politicians express their nostalgia for a faded past.
Thank heavens there are fewer than six years to endure before 2000. Then it
should be clear to everyone, even Mr Major, that the 19th century is over.
Sorry about that moment of passion. I was looking through the prime
minister's address to the Tory ladies when the above-quoted nonsense leapt
out. The business of the day is cool analysis of Mr Major's attack on
Labour's proposals for constitutional reform, and the opposition's response.
The matter can be disposed of quite succinctly. Labour is right on the
merits of the case. The prime minister may be right on where the political
advantage lies. Mr Major believes that his warning that devolution of power
to a Scottish parliament would lead to the break-up of the UK was an
important element in his election victory of 1992; the opposition parties
have nevertheless persisted with their modest proposals for constitutional
change.
These include regional assemblies, the exclusion of hereditary peers from
the House of Lords, a referendum on electoral reform, a bill of rights, a
freedom of information act, and the curtailment of the crown prerogative,
the unwritten law that permits ministers to legislate in the name of the
monarch. Most of these have been propounded in this space, as elsewhere.
Whether or not you agree with any of them or indeed the package as a whole
depends on whether you regard the British executive as sufficiently checked
and balanced by other branches of government - and whether you think our
system is producing good governance.
The argument has been rehearsed many times, principally among the chattering
classes, but also through pressure groups such as Charter 88. This week the
audience may have been further enlarged because Mr Jack Straw appeared on a
TV programme in which he repeated his well-known view that the monarchy
ought to be retrenched, limited to its symbolic functions. That would
protect it from misuse as camouflage for the elective dictatorship. The
Conservatives grasped the opportunity. 'Labour attacks Queen' touches the
nationalist nerve Mr Major hoped to reach when he spoke last Friday. You can
see the Tory train of thought. Never mind the details of the proposals by
the opposition's spokesman on home affairs. They are merely common sense.
Forget the personal life of the Prince of Wales, or the difficulties into
which the minor members of the house of Windsor have stumbled. They are
merely show business.
Concentrate on the Queen herself, the institution, the flag, the nation. Mr
Peter Lilley has done so. 'Labour voters are usually in my experience very
conservative, very pro-monarchy, very pro-Britain,' the secretary for social
security observed at the weekend. There has been plenty of time to get this
kind of thinking into people's heads. It was in 1838 that Peel delineated as
Conservative principles 'the maintenance of the Peerage and the Monarchy -
the continuance of the just powers and attributes of King, Lords, and
Commons . . .' I, and perhaps you, may think that a century and a half later
some rational modifications would improve our polity, but our elevated
opinion may carry little weight when set against bar-room salutes to 'Queen
and Country'.
Yet Labour has no choice but to do battle on this dangerous ground. In
nearly every other area it is the 'me too' party. Privatisation? Labour will
leave untouched whatever it finds in the private sector. Tax increases? Not
us, guv. Schools? We'll do what the Conservatives do, but rename it. Health?
Ditto. Increase public spending? Perish the thought. Changing the nature of
the state is another matter. Labour will undertake what its leader, lovingly
quoted by Mr Major, has called 'the most extensive package of constitutional
reform ever proposed by a British government'. That, said the prime
minister, was a 'sort of teenage madness'.
You could throw in one other small item - the European Union. Broadly
speaking, Labour is for it, the Conservatives increasingly against it. It
was Lady Thatcher who dramatised the connection between Europe, the monarchy
and nationhood when, as prime minister, she spoke of the single currency as
a threat to the Queen's head on the coinage. Conservative Eurosceptics tend
to be Peelites; they view the institutions of England, and the character of
the English, as strengths that 'enabled this country, in her contests and
the fearful rivalry of war, to extort the admiration of the world'.
That may have been stirring stuff in 1838. Today, with the nation in reduced
circumstances, the British constitution clearly needs modernising. To say
that what Parliament ordains is all the law you need is no longer tenable.
If Ulster can have an assembly, why not Scotland? The Crown must adapt to
survive. The Commons should sit for a fixed term. The people should be given
a choice on electoral reform. Labour must counter emotional declarations of
greatness with suchlike reasoned propositions. Alas, bombast usually wins.
Reform sounds sensible to me. But does it stand a chance against 'the Queen,
God bless her'?

FT  23 SEP 94 / Old-style radicals torment their moderate partners:
Divisions between the party's two traditions surfaced at Brighton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone thought the disputes had been settled when the Liberals and Social
Democrats merged to form the Liberal Democrats five years ago.
But, as they departed from a near-disastrous Brighton conference yesterday,
the two traditions were struggling to hide their divisions. For former
Liberals it had been a triumphant week. They voted to legalise cannabis and
tried to abolish the monarchy.
'It's been just like an old-style Liberal conference,' said Mr John Tilley,
the new leader of Kingston Council in south London. 'I can't remember the
last time I saw the party's youth and its radical activists in such great
form.'
But for the former Social Democrats it had been a week of torment. The
radicalism of the party's youth groups had been embarrassing, the economic
policies were vague and self-contradictory and the tabloids were
resurrecting the 'loony' image that haunted the Liberals.
A former SDP parliamentary candidate said: 'We've got to do much better than
this to be taken seriously by the public. You can't debate cannabis without
comprehensively discussing crime. Some of these people don't care whether
they get elected or not.'
Several delegates said the divisions between the two groups - above all over
whether to strike a deal with Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader - had
turned the conference into the most disorganised for years.
Most Liberals with a tradition of fighting Labour in local elections are
against any rapprochement with Mr Blair. Former SDP members, many of whom
came from Labour ranks, find it easier to envisage a deal with the new
Labour leadership.
Mr Neil Sherlock, a traditional Liberal activist and speechwriter for Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said: 'The obsession with Blair meant we
completely took our eye off the ball. The party did not bring together the
different views of its policy groups on the economy. We need to work on that
urgently.'
Another delegate, Mr Jonathan Davies, a former SDP member from Hendon in
north London, said the conference had been too pre-occupied with relations
with other parties and had failed to make the most of its electoral
successes.
'We have just won thousands of local authority seats in the council
elections,' he said. 'And yet, the one thing the party did not do this week
is celebrate its new councillors. Any other party would have done so.'
A few MPs were still smiling at the end. Mr Robert MacLennan, the party's
new president, struck a surreal note by telling delegates it had been a
'great week'. Mr Archy Kirkwood, the chief whip, admitted there had been
presentational difficulties, but added: 'The conference must offer a
showcase of our policies in the run-up to the election.'
There was genuine satisfaction, too, that the party had debated issues such
as drugs and the monarchy, in spite of their political sensitivity. 'These
are the issues being debated in the pubs and clubs,' said Mr John Pointon, a
young delegate from St Helens, Merseyside. 'Other parties just avoid them.'
But for all the confidence of Mr Ashdown's closing speech, many departing
delegates were at odds over the biggest issue of all - how to deal with
Labour.
'Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams and all those SDP people should either
get out of the party or shut up,' said Mr Ralph Bancroft, a veteran
campaigner for the Liberals in Harrow, north London. 'They have done us an
enormous amount of damage over the past few weeks. Let's concentrate on our
own policies.'
But Ms Sarah Prentice, a young councillor in Lambeth, south London, said:
'We have got to think about a strategy towards Labour. Their leader is a
very talented, very able personality. We have to be realistic.'
The debate over Labour will run and run. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats
went back to their constituencies and prepared for Tony Blair.

FT  21 SEP 94 / Ashdown struggles to control Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown was last night struggling to restore his grip over the
Liberal Democrats after the party's Brighton conference again overturned his
efforts to present a more disciplined image to the electorate.
A defeat for the leadership over its approach to a minimum wage was
accompanied by renewed manoeuvring over the party's relationship with the
Labour party. Sir David Steel, a former party leader, added his voice to the
chorus of senior figures calling for the Liberal Democrats to abandon the
pretence that it is neutral between a Labour or Conservative victory at the
next general elections. He suggested that the Liberal Democrats could have
substantial input into a Labour government led by Mr Tony Blair.
With many of the party's activists vehemently opposed to a close
relationship with Labour, Mr Ashdown has resisted publicly endorsing the
stance of the majority of his senior colleagues.
The Liberal Democrat leader sees the potential for much increased
co-operation with Mr Blair but he wants to move slowly to ensure that he
takes his party with him. He is concerned also not to put the Labour leader
in a position where Mr Blair might be forced publicly to renounce the idea
of any partnership.
Mr Ashdown will be looking for signals from Labour that it wants a thaw in
relations. In the longer term, any formal arrangement between the two
parties would depend on Mr Blair embracing a proportional voting system for
elections to the House of Commons.
In yesterday's debate on employment, the conference defied a plea from Mr
Ashdown and his colleagues at Westminster to avoid committing the party to a
minimum wage. Encouraged by Baroness Williams to reject the unanimous
position of the 23 Liberal Democrat MPs, the conference voted to bind the
party to a regionally based system of minimum wage rates to prevent
exploitation of low-paid workers.
The decision marked the second defeat for Mr Ashdown in two days. On Monday
the party voted against the leader to reject a motion to decriminalise
cannabis. Both decisions were seen as a setback to Mr Ashdown's attempts to
present the party to the electorate as distinctive but disciplined. Senior
Liberal Democrats fear they face a third defeat this morning over their tax
and spending proposals.
The leadership, however, was spared further embarrassment when the
conference rejected a motion calling for the abolition of the monarchy in
favour of a republican constitution.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The royal dilemma that won't go away: David Cannadine
predicts that 1993 will contain even more bad news for the beleaguered House
of Windsor
</HEADLINE>

   IF THE events of this astonishing week are any guide
</DATELINE>

which they almost certainly are - the Queen's annus horribilis is going to
drag out through every remaining day of this month until the bells ring out
the old year at midnight on December 31. But it seems inconceivable that
things will end there. For despite the expressions of sympathy and support,
there now appears every prospect that, for both the Queen and her visibly
disintegrating family, 1993 may well be an annus even more horribilis.
Consider the facts. In the course of the past seven days, there has been the
announcement of the Princess Royal's second wedding, which is being rushed
through today with express speed. In between, there has been the news of the
apparently amicable separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, by
comparison with which all the previous royal exposures, conflagrations and
publicity disasters of this year pale into insignificance.
Despite conservative fears and republican hopes, the monarchy is not
self-destructing. However open to ridicule it is in danger of becoming in
the popular press, the show will go on. But the stage has been reached when
the monarchy is pushing the panic button, loud and clear. For the only
conclusion that can be drawn from the terms of the separation settlement is
that neither the palace nor the government has the slightest idea what will
happen next.
It is being insisted in certain official quarters that this separation
arrangement is itself the solution; that the Prince and Princess of Wales
should now be allowed to live their separate and private lives; and that the
future is assured because they will one day come together again as king and
queen. But the settlement has only to be summarised in this way for it to be
clear that, far from being a solution to a problem, it will only make things
worse.
It might well be the case that, the bizarre nature of these terms and future
provisions notwithstanding, nothing else could have been done at this time.
The royal couple could not have gone on as they were; but neither party
wanted an instant divorce, so what else was there to do? And it is also the
case that, now the long-expected and long-predicted separation has actually
happened, the mood of the public is not as easy to gauge or to predict as
had seemed likely before the event.
The truth is that it is not yet clear - and might not be clear for many
months - just how this latest royal misadventure is going to play out in
terms of the public's reaction and response. Already, though, there are
ominous signs that this settlement is not going to work. For all the claims
that there are no constitutional issues and implications, there seems a real
possibility that the monarchy will suffer grave damage. And if a gravely
damaged monarchy is not a constitutional issue, then what is?
Take Prince Charles first. Whatever the reality of his marriage and its
breakdown, recent press coverage shows he is regarded widely as a man who
has failed spectacularly to do the one thing which, rightly or wrongly,
people still expect the heir to the throne to do: namely, to live his family
life successfully. The prince, so this argument runs, has spent a great deal
of time telling society what is good for it. But what right has he to do
this when he has made such a conspicuous hash of his own life?
This leads us to Princess Diana. She might be the most glamorous woman in
the country - indeed, in the world - combining in a remarkable way the
attributes of mother and martyr, saint and cover girl. And it might also be
that this settlement, in which she keeps both the children and her crown, is
a personal triumph for her which she was able to accomplish only because of
her extraordinary public standing. But the idea that, despite all the
sadness of her marriage to Prince Charles, she might still want - and
expect? - to be queen, seems incredible.
Then there is the question of Charles and Diana as separated spouses. What
is going to happen now? Will they have affairs and take lovers? Is it
realistic to suppose that they will be able to keep it a secret if they do?
The prospect of the heir to the throne and his wife leading separate sex
lives must surely be a tabloid editor's dream. In short, the insatiable
appetite of the media for more scandals and more revelations inevitably will
be stimulated by this separation settlement.
What, then, are the realistic prospects of their joint coronation? Only
royal advisers desperate to find a ray of hope - and completely out of touch
with the public mood - could have expected that this proposal would fly. The
idea that at some future, unspecified date, Charles and Diana will give up
their separate lives and come together once more, however briefly, as king
and queen, is an insult to common sense and to the Church of England under
whose auspices the sacrament of their coronation would take place.
Then there is the unfortunate figure of Prince William: the product, like
his mother, of a broken marriage. Already, he is being seen in some quarters
as the next best hope. If only the Prince of Wales will renounce his right
of succession, the argument runs, the crown can pass on, unimpaired, to his
eldest son and this regrettable interlude can be forgotten. But it is not
clear, despite much speculation on the subject, that William - who must have
suffered much already - can be the person to solve the difficulties caused
by his parents' marital break-up.
In short, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this separation settlement
will not settle or stabilise anything. On the contrary, in many ways it can
only make matters worse, more risky and more uncertain than when the royal
pair maintained an official fiction of marriage. The uncertainties will
last, not just into 1993 but for an unforeseeably protracted future. There
might indeed have been no alternative: but that serves only to show how
intractable things have become, and how miserable the prospects appear.
This brings us to the broader issue to which this latest royal disaster
relates. The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales will not only
intensify the prurient intrusiveness of the tabloid press: it will also
intensify the debate about the purpose, function and future of the monarchy
itself (a debate, it must be remembered, to which the Queen herself gave her
royal imprimatur recently).
In the long perspective of history, the problem which, it seemed, the
British had solved brilliantly was that of finding something for a monarchy
to do once its traditional functions - as law-giver and warrior - had been
given up or taken away.
The solution which evolved was 'constitutional monarchy' which, essentially,
meant trading power for pageantry, dynastic profligacy for a royal family,
and Germanic accents for an imperial crown.
The fundamental difficulty for the monarchy today is that, during the
present queen's reign, these functions and justifications have been
gradually but inexorably eroded. She herself is among a declining number in
England who believe in the Commonwealth. And the pageantry of which royal
weddings were such an integral part has surely now become questionable: it
certainly has for Princess Anne at Crathie church today.
Deprived of these 'traditional' functions, it is not altogether clear what
there is left for the British monarchy to do. Or, put more depressingly, it
is not at all clear what the sovereign, her relatives and her advisers
believe there is to do. Perhaps the course is set already and a Monaco
monarchy - trivialised and a perpetual scandal-machine - is indeed the only
future function on offer. (After all, in the long run, the British monarchy
has swung repeatedly from respectability to scandal and back to
respectability again. Perhaps what we are now witnessing is merely the next
inexorable swing of the pendulum).
The British monarchy has survived damaging troublesbefore - most obviously
in the time of the delinquent children of King George III - and it could
well be that it will survive the latest scandals as well. But the 1990s are
not the 1820s. Then, Britain was a rigidly hierarchical society and, in the
majority of countries, monarchy was still the natural order of things.
Today, by contrast, monarchy can be seen as an anachronistic relic which, if
it is to survive as anything more than a tawdry and demeaning soap opera,
must do something serious, sensible and substantial to justify itself.
Thus far, that is the challenge to which the embattled and beleaguered House
of Windsor has failed conspicuously to rise this year. What is the British
monarchy for? What sort of monarchy have we got? What sort of monarchy do we
need? Do we need a monarchy at all? As the royal family falls apart before
our curious eyes, these questions are going to become more, not less,
insistent.
If the Queen is serious in wanting debate on the monarchy, she will be well
advised to address the issues in her Christmas message. Platitudes about
peace on earth, happy families and her annus horribilis will no longer
suffice.

much maligned monarch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LOUIS XVI
by John Hardman
Yale Pounds 19.95, 264 pages
GUILLOTINED two hundred years ago on January 21 1793, Louis XVI remains the
most elusive of monarchs. His piety, his silences, the disappearance of many
of his papers, are so many barriers to understanding. Revolutionary
propaganda and the royalist cult of the Martyr King have further distorted
the truth.
Paradoxically, Louis XVI was at first a success. When he was only 20, in
1774, he inherited a weak and discredited throne. Yet he restored French
finances and diplomatic prestige, defeated Britain in the War of American
Independence, and began a programme of unobtrusive but effective reforms -
including civil rights for Protestants, long before Catholics had them in
Britain. In some ways he was more modern than his immediate successors.
Beside his conscious rejection of territorial annexations in Europe, the
expansionism of the Republic and the Empire appears infantile and
counterproductive.
He was well educated and intelligent (his German and English were
excellent). His obsession with facts and figures - revealed in his famous
hunting diary - helped his grasp of finance. He was more opposed to the
violence and arrogance than to some of the aims of the revolutionaries.
According to John Hardman, in 1787 he 'virtually called the Third Estate
into existence as a political force.' Why then did he die beneath the
guillotine's blade?
One answer is his conscience. No monarch or ruler can afford to say, as he
did at his travesty of a trial, 'I declare to you that my conscience
reproaches me with nothing.' His predecessors had devoted themselves to
strengthening the royal power-base and propaganda machine. Louis XVI put le
bonheur des francais first, thereby losing the power to realise it.
Few kings, however, have faced such difficulties - and such treachery.
Beneath a show of obedience, members of his family, and some of his
ministers, pursued policies hostile to his own. Hardman shows that the Comte
de Vergennes, one of the greatest foreign ministers in the history of
France, a confidant and favourite of the King, intrigued against the King
and Queen during the Diamond Necklace Affair in order to bring witnesses
favourable to the Cardinal de Rohan back to France. The Finance Minister and
popular idol Necker sabotaged the Seance Royale of July 17 1789. The Right
in the National Assembly was as ready to flout the King's will as the left.
John Hardman's biography coincides not just with the two hundredth
anniversary of the King's death but with the final realisation by much of
French opinion that it was worse than a crime, a mistake. Only 262 pages
long, this is a political history, with little on the King's piety, his
concern for the poor or his artistic patronage.
In my opinion, Hardman is not critical enough of such sources as the
denigratory diary of the Abbe de Veri or the hagiographical memoirs of Baron
Hue. Nor is he sufficiently forthright about the treachery of Marie
Antoinette towards her husband. Not all errors are minor. Far from showing
that the King continued paying those bodyguards who emigrated, the papers
from the Tuileries show that he stopped. The posthumous cult of Louis XVI is
ignored.
Nevertheless, the force of prejudice, especially about royal figures, is so
strong that this is the only sane assessment of Louis XVI in English since
his death. The bright light of Hardman's archival research dispels the fogs
of revolutionary and royalist propaganda. A different man emerges:
energetic, sardonic, rarely influenced by the Queen except perhaps in
1787-9. He could fly into 'a towering rage'; different ministers described
him as 'harsh' or 'implacable'; he had a sense of humour (he called
Catherine II Madame Potemkin), and a grasp of reality. Although he failed to
exploit it in the crucial months May-July 1789, he knew that the amour
propre of 'the bourgeoisie' (his term) was one of the main forces behind the
revolution. By July 1789 the Paris mob was uncontrollable and the royal army
unreliable. To have survived on the throne, and saved France from civil war,
for three more years, was no ordinary achievement.
On the political history of the reign Hardman is generally judicious and
interesting. By ignoring the military dimension, he fails to explain why the
King lost, or failed to use, ultima ratio regum: cannon power. This
breakdown, more than fundamental political conflict, is the real explanation
for the hiatus in monarchical power in France between 1792 and 1804.

FT  29 JAN 93 / At unease with itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's establishment is not at ease with itself. There is disquiet in the
upper ranks. It goes beyond concern about the latest unemployment figures,
or the balance of payments deficit, or the ballooning of the public sector
borrowing requirement. The winter does not help. The recession certainly has
a lot to do with it. But it is more than that. The chattering classes, whose
perceptions sometimes influence the rest of the nation, are once again
telling one another that all is not quite right with the state of affairs on
these islands.
I record this with apologies to my former boss, Sir Geoffrey Owen, who wrote
in these pages last week that 'exaggerated gloom about all things British is
unnecessary and counter-productive'. Quite so. Our post-1945 history has not
been all gloom and bust. Yet confidence in the British polity seems to me to
be sagging.
One reason is that the keystone of our constitution, the throne, is looking
shaky. Mr Jack Straw, an opposition frontbencher, has voiced the opinion of
many in the Labour party that the monarchy should be reformed. A weekend
report suggested that perhaps a quarter of Labour members are republicans.
Loyal defenders of the Queen are to be found in all sections of the House of
Commons. They constitute a solid majority. The difficulty arises when the
talk is of her successor. Then there is a division of opinion, a general
shuffling of feet.
If the Prince of Wales divorces his wife, it will be incongruous for him to
become 'supreme governor' of the Church of England. Yet in order to succeed
his mother, he would have to adopt the role of temporal head of the Anglican
church. This prospect has stimulated a modest revival of the centuries-old
debate about whether the church should become disestablished, or separated
from the state. If - when - it does, an ancient appendage of the English
constitution will have fallen away. According to figures in the government's
statistical annual, Social Trends, we may one day be talking of having an
Established Mosque to take its place. Since 1975, the number of Moslems in
Britain has more than doubled, to just less than a million. In the same
period, Anglican church membership fell from 2.27m to 1.84m.
The church is painfully aware of this. Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of
York, is no disestablishmentarian. He has, however, proposed that the
coronation oath be adjusted to reaffirm religious freedom for all. He was
principally motivated, I suspect, by Christian ecumenism. This deserves
strong support. Yet the assertion, contained in our education laws, that
Britain is predominantly Christian is belied by the decline in the
membership of most churches.
If we cannot be certain of either the C of E or the next king, what is left?
For some, the national spirit has long been bolstered by Britain's position
as a principal player on the world stage. This week Mr Douglas Hurd
contrived to bring us down to earth. 'Britain simply does not have the
option of turning its back on the wider world,' he said. But that is not the
whole story. Pluck out another sentence from the foreign secretary's speech:
'Obviously we cannot be everywhere and we cannot do everything.' And a
third: 'Where we act, our action must be proportionate.' Most tellingly, Mr
Hurd warned that 'We shall probably have to say 'no' more often than 'yes'.'
One purpose of this important lecture was to ward off American demands that
more British troops be sent to Bosnia. It was, however, more significant
than that. It marked a further ratcheting-down of Britain's global reach.
Our army is overstretched, and under budgetary constraint. Admitting as
much, Mr Hurd pointed out that we have an excellent diplomatic service. He
did not say that in dealings with other countries and international bodies
the Foreign Office's quickness of tongue often disguises the slightness of
its hand. This cannot go on forever. Sooner or later the UN Security Council
will be reformed. When that happens, Britain will be lucky to keep its place
as a permanent member.
There are other possible explanations for our generally pessimistic mood.
The national political pulse is not stimulated when the same political party
wins four general elections in a row. The Conservatives have been through a
bad five years. Things started to go wrong in 1988, when the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's government was overflowing with pride. The splits over
Europe, the resignations, the poll tax, the toppling of the former prime
minister all followed. The Tories have never really recovered. Today a
divided party is barely supporting a government with a shrunken
parliamentary majority. There is no solace in looking to the opposition. It
is not in any shape to inspire us, let alone win an election. As matters
stand, it looks as if the existing, less than glorious government can
continue in office for many more years.
It is, however, a weak administration. I like this: the less power ministers
command, the better. But the British psyche is conditioned to expect strong
government. That means that when the cabinet decides something, it is
automatically passed by the Commons. This is not happening. The combination
of a low majority and a divided party has the government running scared.
Some parliamentary select committees are beginning to exercise a degree of
influence over the administration that they previously only dreamed of.
Backbenchers' opinions are actually being solicited by ministers. To the
traditional English way of thinking this is a minor revolution. It is as
disturbing as all the tiresome talk about the monarchy, the church and our
role in the world.
I prefer to give this kaleidoscope a twist. The picture becomes brighter.
Look: the monarchy is reformed. Church and state are to be disentangled.
People start going to church again. Look again: we tailor our foreign policy
according to our cloth. The political marketplace forces Labour to become an
electable opposition. The emergence of a parliament that can check the
cabinet is generally welcomed. With experience, this government improves.
The economic cycle has not been abolished. Spring is on the way.
The two latter propositions are undeniable. The rest are merely items on a
wish-list.

FT  16 DEC 94 / Bulgaria backs ex-communists and king: The political revival
of two rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOFIA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP), successor to what was once the eastern
European communist party most loyal to Moscow, is expected to return to
power after general elections this weekend. If so, it will join similar
parties in Lithuania, Poland and Hungary which revived like Lazarus from
what was widely assumed to be death after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
But an equally miraculous revival has been taking place at the opposite end
of the political spectrum - a surge in popular enthusiasm for the idea of
monarchy in general and for the exiled monarch, ex-King Simeon the Second,
in particular.
The popularity of the king has been rising since the downfall of Todor
Zhivkov, the old communist dictator, in 1989. Even President Zhelyu Zhelev,
a former dissident, who used to be the most popular politician in Bulgaria,
recently came behind King Simeon in public opinion polls.
The 57-year-old king, who lives in Madrid, is widely considered to be closer
to restoration as a modern constitutional monarch than any other exiled
royal claimant in the former communist world. Many of the 49 political
organisations contesting the election have sought to capitalise on the
popular longing for 'a good and just king'.
The socialists have not been able to ride the monarchist chariot for
ideological reasons. But political rivals claim the BSP has secretly
inspired monarchist organisations to register for the election to prevent
them joining the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the main anti-communist
coalition. Every vote diverted from the UDF serves the BSP cause.
In 1991, most royalists voted for the UDF after King Simeon appealed to
Bulgarians to vote for the 'democratic forces'. This was interpreted as
support for the UDF, although the king refused to urge anyone to vote for a
particular party. Dispersion of pro-monarchist votes, meanwhile, meant that
none of the divided monarchist groups managed to clear the 4 per cent hurdle
needed to enter parliament.
This weekend's early elections result from the refusal of both the BSP and
the UDF to replace the outgoing non-party government of technocrats. This
was led by an academic, Mr Lyuben Berov, but supported by the BSP. It
resigned last September after successfully renegotiating Bulgaria's Dollars
9.3bn (Pounds 5.7bn) foreign debt.
This time around the UDF has failed to attract more than a few of the
smaller pro-monarchist clubs to join its election campaign and has found it
hard to attract pro-monarchist and pro-republican voters. The UDF has
pledged to contest the 1946 referendum which abolished the monarchy, but has
not come out in favour of a restoration.
King Simeon has urged the monarchist groups to unite. But political
infighting and personal power struggles have left voters to decide between
seven big monarchist groups and many smaller monarchist clubs.
All that unites the groups is a desire for restoration of the old Turnovo
constitution. The king's supporters say he is still the monarch as there was
no formal abdication. The royal family was forced to leave Bulgaria when
Simeon was just nine years old after a rigged plebiscite under the new
communist rulers.
This abolished the monarchy in 1946, although the Turnovo constitution, with
the monarchy as head of state, was not changed at the time. On reaching his
18th birthday, Simeon of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was proclaimed King of the
Bulgarians under the Turnovo constitution.
Opinion polls suggest that more and more Bulgarians see restoration of the
monarchy as a guarantee of stability. Royalists also argue that monarchy
could help build a barrier against further ethnic tensions in the Balkans.
Politicians, eager to seize more power in elections, are more prone to
manipulating ethnic minorities than a monarch capable of rising above such
calculations, they say.
In an interview, King Simeon said that he could provide the country with
'unity, national reconciliation and a sense of recovered dignity'.
The ex-king does not rule out the possibility of co-existence of
constitutional monarchy with a socialist government. But analysts in Sofia
doubt that the monarch could be brought closer to the throne if the polls
are accurate and the politically disciplined BSP defeats the divided
monarchist and anti-communist forces.
The latter outnumber the socialists by a big majority, but have proved
unable as yet to forge the alliances needed to keep the socialists out of
power or put the king back on his throne.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Ashdown aims conference to bolster broad appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, is seeking a formula
which will help his party demonstrate its ability to remain a distinctive
political force when it opens the party conference season at Brighton on
September 18.
Appearances by Sir Brian Nicholson, president of the CBI, and Mr John Monks,
general secretary of the TUC, at fringe meetings will help bolster the
party's claim to have a broader appeal than either the Conservatives or
Labour.
But Mr Ashdown is still at odds with some of the senior figures in the
party, including Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the Liberal Democrat leader in
the Lords, over the desirability of publicly emphasising its readiness to
co-operate with Mr Tony Blair's new-look Labour party.
The difficulties Mr Ashdown faces in staking out the ground on which the
party can exert a dominant influence in the run-up to the next general
election were played down when the conference agenda was published
yesterday.
Party managers want the conference to focus on successes at local government
level and in parliamentary by-elections, which increased the number of
Liberal Democrat MPs in the Commons to 23.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president, insisted yesterday that these
outweighed the party's disappointing showing in having only two MPs elected
to the European parliament in June.
Demands for the repeal of the financial services act and the establishment
of a powerful regulatory body to oversee the operation of financial
institutions are also made. Mr Jeremy Hanley, chairman of the Conservative
party, said the Liberal Democrats were showing their 'true colours'in
agreeing to debate the abolition of the monarchy.
He stressed that this followed publication of a 'punitive taxation policy'.
Mr Hanley said: 'How those who voted Liberal Democrat at recent by-elections
must feel cheated and betrayed by what portrays itself as a moderate party
but is in reality more socialist than the socialists.'

THE MONARCHY Central Office of Information HMSO Pounds 5
ROYAL FORTUNE: TAX, MONEY AND THE MONARCHY By Phillip Hall Bloomsbury Pounds
18.99
ELIZABETH R By Antony Jay BBC Books Pounds 14.95
Britain's monarchy has been around since the ninth century. It existed four
centuries before parliament, three centuries before the law courts. So
whoever is on the throne should be used to outbreaks of royal unpopularity.
It comes with the job.
Nevertheless, Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates 40 years on the throne
today, is bound to be conscious that her subjects have become increasingly
vexed of late about the issue of her tax-exempt status. In terms of popular
debate, the question of the Queen's exemption generates far more heat than
equally serious ones such as her support for the honours system, or her role
as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Three new books take up the
issue.
The Monarchy, the Central Office of Information's official handbook on
British royalty, states the position simply: 'As part of the royal
prerogative, the Queen does not pay tax on either her private wealth and
income or her Civil List payments, unless parliament decides otherwise.'
This begs for explanation, particularly since opinion polls show that
three-quarters of the public feel that the Queen should pay tax. Phillip
Hall, a sociology lecturer at a west London college of further education,
does his best to elaborate in Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the Monarchy.
A big portion of his book 'reveals the long and hitherto hidden history of
royal tax-paying and the devious and secretive ways by which it was brought
to an end'. Of the seven changes in royal tax status since 1910 only two
were made public at the time and one of the crucial files explaining changes
in the king's tax status in the late 1930s was destroyed in 1977.
The thesis is that throughout the 20th century, while more and more people
have been caught in the tax net, British monarchs have lobbied successfully
to escape taxation and to accumulate wealth. The Swedish king pays tax on
his private income, as does the Japanese emperor. Italy ended the Vatican's
tax exemption on its investment income in 1968. According to Hall, the Queen
is Britain's richest person - so why shouldn't she pay her share? Equity
demands that she should, according to Hall.
Partiality harms his case. Despite a heroic trawl through the archives,
Hall's arguments are weakened by his own bias against the monarchy.
When The Economist - which has no obvious anti-monarchical bias - decided to
look into the subject of the Queen's finances, it was taken to task for
suggesting that the Queen's fortune is probably less than Pounds 50m, rather
than more than Pounds 7bn, as is sometimes suggested. The journalist Paul
Foot dismissed the estimate as 'crude establishment disinformation printed
in an establishment newspaper to protect the Queen from (Hall's) critical
book'.
It is tempting to blame outbreaks of royal unpopularity on ill-informed and
ill-disposed members of the media. But, as Antony Jay, author of the
television series Yes Minister, says in Elizabeth R, the press is rather
like the old London mob. 'They may have got hold of the wrong information
and ideas, their demands may be impossible to put into practice and their
methods may be questionable, but the feelings . . . are a reality and it is
dangerous to ignore them.'
The Queen's tax-free life is an example. 'There is something about royal tax
exemption that stirs primitive emotions in the British taxpayer's breast: a
feeling of 'I pay, so why shouldn't she?', which cannot be refuted by
rational argument,' says Jay.
The Queen is not the only public figure with special tax privileges, but she
is the only one who does not pay any income tax or death duties. Clearly,
the tax-free status of her personal fortune is a big perk. But since its
size and rate of growth are unknown, it is impossible to judge the scale of
the privilege.
Jay differs from Hall in his view that the Queen's personal wealth is not in
the same league as the Duke of Westminster's or even the Sainsbury family's.
One way of defusing the controversy would be to release a semi-official
estimate of the Queen's personal wealth. However, putting a figure on the
fortune is complicated by the fact that there is no clear distinction
between what belongs to the state and what is the monarch's own.
Another possibility would be for the Queen to follow the Prince of Wales's
example and pay 25 per cent of income in lieu of tax. But this opens the
issue of whether it would be dignified for the Queen to take steps to
minimise even her voluntary payment. She can hardly go offshore.
And if she starts paying taxes, will she be allowed to vote? In law, the
Queen as a private person can do no wrong. She is immune from civil or
criminal proceedings and cannot be sued. So what happens if there is a
dispute with the tax authorities? Walter Bagehot might turn in his grave,
but perhaps it is time for a Select Committee to look into the whole matter.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini told African National Congress President Nelson 
Mandela on Friday [8 April] morning he would have to distance 
himself from the ANC's shooting of Zulu marchers outside the 
ANC's Shell House head office before their dialogue continued. 
The Zulu monarch met Mr Mandela at an undisclosed venue before a 
meeting between the king, Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk and 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  The king's presentation to Mr Mandela was released by Mr. 
Buthelezi's office. 
  "Until and unless you personally distance yourself from the 
shedding of the innocent blood of my father's people by means of 
your personal initiative leading to the conviction of those who 
are guilty of this crime, our dialogue will remain difficult if 
not impossible," King Zwelithini said. 
  King Zwelithini said immediate steps were required from Mr 
Mandela to heal the wounds arising from the Shell House 
massacre. He asked that Mr Mandela make available all 
information related to the killings. 
  "I ask that you do whatever is in your power as the 
president 
of the ANC to ensure that all those who plotted, organised and 
executed the massacre are arrested and tried for their crime," 
he said. 
  The Zulu king also condemned ANC statements on the monarchy 
and the kwaZulu government. 
  "The insults that many spokespersons of the ANC, and 
particularly the Natal leaders of the ANC, have hurled at me at 
numerous times, that I am on the payroll of the kwaZulu 
government or that my Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu is my 
paymaster, is something which is more than just offensive." 
  He said any action taken against the kwaZulu legislative 
assembly would be an action against him as reigning king. 
  He said Mr Mandela and the ANC had repeatedly flouted royal 
protocol in their approaches to the institution of the Zulu 
monarchy. 
  He detailed the failed attempts at arranging a meeting 
between himself and Mr Mandela and said it would be wrong for 
him not to get "these things off my chest". 
  However, he said he did not expect issues of protocol to 
cloud the discussions. "I put them down for the record without 
expecting them to be the cause of any acrimony between us." 
  King Zwelithini said he regarded the state of emergency in 
Natal/kwaZulu as an invasion. "I want to make it clear that I, 
the king of the Zulu nation, consider the declaration of a state 
of emergency in kwaZulu to be an act of foreign aggression, an 
invasion of our territory and a rape of our national dignity and 
pride. 
  "I...shall never recognise the legitimacy of the actions 
taken in terms of the declaration of the state of emergency." 
  He said the stigmatisation of his uncle, Chief 
Kwaphindangene 
(Chief Minister Buthelezi) had also caused offence. "It was he 
who destroyed the South African Government's homeland policy, 
and it was his refusal to accept so-called independence that 
destroyed Mr John Vorster's and Mr P W Botha's dream of 
establishing a confederation of South African states." 
  King Zwelithini said the summit was taking place against the 
background of two direct and intolerable attacks on the Zulu 
nation -- the Shell House massacre and the state of emergency. 
  "I have only done as much as is needed to clear things from 
my heart so that we can talk openly and simply about the prime 
purpose of our meeting". 
  He said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the 
sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. He said sovereignty could not 
be negotiated or conferred upon kwaZulu by anybody. 
  "Throughout the period of conquest and subjugation, it was 
Zulu identity which kept the Zulus intact as a vibrant force 
against colonialism and apartheid." The Zulus had never been 
crushed, he said. 
  He said sovereignty forged by history could not be undone 
by political edict or by the passing of a law or by the forcing 
of a constitution on the people of a sovereign kingdom. "Now 
that apartheid has been finally destroyed and a new South Africa 
is being shaped, there shall emerge a sovereign Zulu kingdom. 
  "I am not prepared to talk to you...about whether or not 
there shall be a sovereign Zulu kingdom in the new South Africa. 
  "The only thing to talk about are the modalities of bringing 
the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom into full recognitio and 
relating the kingdom properly to the rest of South Africa." 
  He said the kingdom would be bounded by the Transvaal in the 
west, Mozambique and Swaziland in the north and Transkei and 
Lesotho in the south and south-west. 
  He said the 1993 constitution, even as amended, extended the 
"greedy arm of Pretoria right across the Zulu kingdom". He said 
he rejected the constitution. He said the kingdom needed a 
militia which the constitution did not provide. 
  King Zwelithini said he had been forced to act decisively by 
the failure of negotiations to deliver a federal dispensation. 
Nor was the negotiators' provision for traditional leaders 
sufficient recognition of the Zulu monarchy. 
  "As things stand now I cannot encourage my father's people 
to 
vote on April 26-28 and thereby lend legitimacy to what will be 
the destruction of the very foundations on which the sovereignty 
of the Zulu kingdom rests." 
  He said Mr Mandela was rushing into an election rejected by 
himself and the Zulu people. 
  King Zwelithini said a constitution had been written for the 
state of kwaZulu/Natal in December, 1992. It set out the Zulu 
nation's bottomline demands. 
  He said he had been hoping for a a federal system in which 
the constitution would be recognised. 
  He called on all Zulus to unite and to defend kwaZulu 
freedom 
and sovereignty. 
  "The road ahead is not going to be an easy one," he warned. 
  "We the Zulu nation convene today on the battleground which 
subjugated the freedom of our forefathers. 
  "We here today proclaim before the world our freedom and 
sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at all costs. 
  "Whether we end up as part of one federal state of South 
Africa or as a completely autonomous state will depend on what 
you and others in South Africa do to me and my people. The key 
thing is whether you are prepared to listen to our just 
aspirations or whether, like those who conquered us, you think 
you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my 
nation."

FT  13 JAN 93 / PM rejects statutory controls on press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR statutory controls on the press were rejected by Mr John Major
yesterday amid disclosures that at least one member of the Royal family had
sanctioned leaks about their personal life to tabloid newspapers.
Downing Street officials said the prime minister would not support the
creation of a tribunal with legal authority to impose sanctions against
newspapers judged to have breached strict new privacy rules.
His stance was revealed as ministers tacitly confirmed reports that the
Princess of Wales had played a behind-the-scenes role in press coverage last
year of the break-up of her marriage to Prince Charles. There was no
confirmation that Prince Charles had done likewise.
The disclosures were judged at Westminster to have delivered another
damaging blow to the standing of a monarchy which has been plagued by
controversy for more than a year. They had also undercut much of the recent
criticism of the press by those MPs seeking tougher controls.
Mr Major's opposition killed the central recommendation of the report on the
press drawn up by Sir David Calcutt, QC, even before it was officially
published.
According to leaks of the report - confirmed as accurate by officials - Sir
David calls for the replacement of the present Press Complaints Commission
by a statutory tribunal with the powers to impose large fines on newspapers.
The report was handed to ministers last week and will be considered by the
full cabinet tomorrow but one senior minister commented bluntly last night:
'There is not a hope in hell of a statutory body.'
Lord McGregor of Durris, the chairman of the PCC and a fierce opponent of
statutory regulation, said last night that it was 'game, set and match' to
opponents of the Calcutt report. He described the section of the report
devoted to the PCC as 'reeking with prejudice and malice'.
Downing Street stressed that the prime minister's judgment had not been
affected by the latest revelations concerning the role played by Princess
Diana in the sensational reporting of her marriage problems.
Mr Major and other senior colleagues still backed the idea of new
legislation to outlaw electronic eavesdropping and other 'intrusive'
practices which involved trespass on private property.
The aim would be to protect all individuals from unjustified invasions of
privacy rather than to shield specifically the Royal Family and other
prominent public figures.
But the reports that close friends of Princess Diana fed information on her
behalf to the tabloids to ensure her case was present in stories about the
marriage break-up caused acute embarrassment in Downing Street.
It also raised new question marks among MPs about Mr Major's insistence last
month that the subsequent separation of the Royal couple would not prevent
Princess Diana at some stage being crowned Queen.
The disclosure was made in a letter sent by Lord McGregor to Sir David as
part of his inquiry. Lord McGregor revealed that Buckingham Palace had
apologised to him after first denying and then, in effect, admitting that
Princess Diana had actively collaborated in reports. Officials confirmed
that Mr Major and other senior ministers had been kept informed last year of
the charge laid by Lord Mc-Gregor.

<TEXT>
   She's only fifth in line to the throne, but from
the hospital crowds to the headlines, the birth of Britain's newest
princess has shown the royal family working a magic that defies
even the experts.
   ``I can't think why there's such hysterical interest really,''
said Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett's Peerage, which chronicles
Britain's blue bloods.
   ``But it just keeps increasing ... Maybe it's because there's
been a leveling out of social classes _ which is very good, but at
the same time does make for rather boring reading,'' Kidd said in
an interview.
   ``And these characters are supposed to be a bit bigger than
life, or we're led to believe they are,'' he added.
   And so they seemed Tuesday.
   Almost all of Britain's dozen national newspapers splashed
across their front pages the Monday night birth of the Princess of
York to Queen Elizabeth's second son, Andrew, and his wife, Sarah.
   Radio and television networks led bulletins repeatedly with the
news, edging out the cease-fire agreement in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Only the Communist Morning Star and the newest upscale
newspaper, the 375,000-circulation Independent, ignored or paid
little attention to the birth of the queen's fifth grandchild.
   ``We are not much interested in minor royals, but we did record
the event,'' said John Price, news editor of the Independent, which
gave the story three lines on page 2. ``The Independent's view is
that these people don't matter.''
   It was a lonely view.
   Compared with the attention given to Europe's other major
surviving monarchies _ the Spanish, the Scandinavians, the Dutch
and the Belgians _ Britain erupted with royal fever.
   The monarchs of Sweden, Denmark and Norway attract plenty of
attention among their Scandinavian subjects, but not much elsewhere.
   In the Netherlands, by the time former Queen Juliana's youngest
grandchild, also Juliana, was born in October 1981, interest in
royal babies had cooled. The little Juliana was the ex-queen's 13th
grandchild.
   In Sweden, the birth in 1982 of a third child, Princess
Madeleine, to King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia, dominated the
local news but did not make world headlines.
   Royal babies not in direct line to the throne receive scant
attention. Only one newspaper in Norway mentioned the birth in
Brazil last month of Norwegian King Olav's second great-grandchild.
   In Belgium, pictures of King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola seldom
appear in then news. The heir to the throne, Baudouin's nephew,
Prince Albert, keeps even further out of the limelight.
   In contrast, the royal family of the tiny principality of Monaco
has the photographers in hot pursuit, particularly Princess
Caroline and Princess Stephanie, daughters of Prince Rainier and
the late Grace Kelly.
   But even for them, the scrutiny palls compared to the life of
the British monarch's children and their offspring.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
attributes the publicity given Andrew's wife, Sarah, partly to what
he says has become an international hobby _ British royal-watching
_ and partly to her unusual background for a royal bride.
   The former Sarah Ferguson had no title, was a commoner, had two
serious romances before Andrew, and pursued her career in a graphic
arts company.
   He believes that historians will credit the former Miss Ferguson
with ``taking the royal family into the 21st century.''
   ``From the literally thousands of letters we get _ from
Americans, Germans, Japanese _ wanting information about the royal
family, it's clear that royal-watching has become as much a hobby
as stamp-collecting,'' said Brooks-Baker.
   The birth of the Princess of York received more publicity in
Britain than did the birth in 1947 of Prince Charles, heir to the
throne, he said.
   ``This interest in things royal is a great snowball ...
interesting and also terrifying,'' said Brooks-Baker.
   ``As this soap opera becomes more and more universal, one
wonders where it is going to end and whether it will crush the very
people it is portraying. I don't know.''

They seem to be acting up in the colonies again. Some free spirit has
decided to organise a Monarchy and Australia Conference at the Australian
High Commission next month and not invite anyone from Buckingham Palace,
though it is but a short carriage-ride away.
The conference will concentrate on such weighty themes as 'Monarchy to
Republic: into the symbolic void', 'How I gave up the Monarchy and came to
love the Commonwealth', and 'Rank desire: the imperial underbelly of the
order of Australia'. Professor David Cannadine, that well-known royal
basher, heads a cast of speakers which includes Tom Nairn on 'The Chances
for a Scottish Republic', and the ubiquitous Marina Warner on 'From
Britannia to Lady Di'.
Admittedly, not all of them have a Republican bent and there will no doubt
be a few nods of approval to Sir Robert Menzies, who loyally served the
monarchy as Australian prime minister for 16 years.
The old boy once told the Queen that in his country 'every man, woman and
child who even sees you as a passing glimpse will remember it with joy. In
the words of the 17th century poet: 'I did but see her passing by. But yet I
love her till I die.' '
He must be turning in his grave at the news that the Sir Robert Menzies
Centre for Australian Studies at the University of London is sponsoring the
event.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Mr Blobby for Number 10
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Time to put my money where my mouth is and produce a few fearless forecasts
for 1994, even though, on balance, it looks like being a muddling year -
neither memorable nor especially horrible though marked, come autumn, by the
first tangible wisps of PMT (pre-millennial tension).
None of these forecasts is based on econometric modelling or indeed on
anything more highfalutin than hunch and experience. They are serious
predictions, though I am happy to confess - most forecasters never do this -
that wishful thinking has infected most of them.
Off we go:
Stock markets world-wide will endure a nastier ride than most pundits are
predicting. The FT-SE 100 will set a record high of approximately 3,660
before Easter, then endure months of choppiness before falling like a stone
in September or October, finishing the year below 3,000. I myself plan to go
almost totally liquid on February 24, which happens to be my birthday.
Contrary to what the experts say, gold will glitter in 1994 as it dawns on
market-makers that every 15 seconds another 45 people are born on earth and
that 10 of them, at least, are likely to be gold-bugs. In 1994 gold will
again approach Dollars 500 an ounce (Dollars 391 at present) as a prelude to
startling gains at the end of the century.
It will be a good year for Bill Clinton - Washington's dozy columnists will
finally warm to him - and a good year, too, for Hilary Clinton, her
husband's possible successor as US president in seven years' time.
But it will be a cruel and desperate period for Europe's leaders,
particularly John Major, whose days as UK prime minister are - mercifully -
numbered. Major won't be pushed; he will go voluntarily, late in the year,
probably late at night, his poor wife in tow, deciding, not unnaturally,
that enough is enough and that he has already endured more obloquy than
mortal man can bear. (Why should he worry? He will become a rich and
much-loved pensioner). His successor - but only for a short while - will be
Kenneth Clarke, the Mr Blobby of UK politics. Eventually, however, the
present chancellor's astonishing good luck will dribble to an end and he
will be stabbed in the back - with svelteness, of course - by Michael
Portillo.
John Smith will meander through another low-key year as Britain's Opposition
leader and will (or will not) move towards some form of alliance with
Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. If he doesn't, the Tories
stand a chance of stealing the next election just as they stole the last
one.
Something unpleasant, painful and messy will happen to bossy Virginia
Bottomley, the UK health secretary. I won't say what; it would ruin the fun.
Soccer's World Cup will be tremendously successful, with Norway beating
Brazil 3-1 in the final. The success of the competition will lead millions
of American sports fans to wonder why, all these years, they let themselves
be fobbed off with such girl's-blouse sports as baseball and basketball.
It will be a good year for Prince Charles as more and more people come to
appreciate the attraction of having a divorced heir to the British throne.
What could be more fin de siecle, modern or sophisticated? (The divorce
itself will come next year). Behind the scenes, Queen Elizabeth II will be
informing her less-than-close relatives that the gravy train has departed
and that the monarchy is being downsized while revelling secretly in the
knowledge that she and her heirs are safe.
Correspondingly, the Church of England will stumble ever faster towards
disestablishment and outer darkness.
The Grand National steeplechase will again be a fiasco.
People who hunt animals - big ones, small ones - will feel more and more
like pariahs as revulsion at their activities becomes pronounced.
Newsdesks will realise that people are fed up with coverage of Russia and
China. What people want most is about 30 years' silence from Russia and
China while those two unfortunate countries ponder their mistakes and
smarten up their acts. That is my fondest wish for 1994: that we hear
nothing more from Moscow and Beijing until New Year's Day, 2024.

FT  27 NOV 93 / 'Not a salesman but he can do his bit for Britain': The
search for a role for the Prince of Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Prince of Wales intended this week to refocus debate on more serious
aspects of his responsibilities, he cannot have been disappointed.
His remarks, which made known his frustrations over lack of government
support during overseas royal visits, created an instant stir around
Whitehall and Westminster which seems certain to lead to a reappraisal of
the prince's potential role as an ambassador for Britain.
Ministers were this week quick to acknowledge the value of the prince in
helping promote Britain in important overseas markets. They were equally
ready to accept that more could be done to fully exploit his unique
position.
Within hours of the prince's views becoming known on Monday Mr John Major
was pledging his support for moves to improve the commercial effectiveness
of the heir to the throne's overseas visits.
But when the dust has settled, what is the real scope for ensuring that the
value of the prince, in the context of helping to promote British companies
and products, can be further enhanced?
Both the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry are anxious
to emphasise the support they already provide for overseas royal visits. But
if the programme of visits has in the past been seen by officials more as a
time-consuming nuisance than a positive opportunity, the prince's remarks
and the political fall-out will bring a renewed effort to consider such
trips in a more strategic light.
With Downing Street 'keen' to do everything possible to help, an improvement
in co-ordination between departments when visits are being planned and the
provision of ministerial back-up during tours is on the agenda.
The DTI is examining ways of better exploiting the prince's apparent
readiness to help wave the flag for Britain and Mr Richard Needham, the
trade minister, will soon discuss ideas directly with the prince.
St James' palace has stressed that it does not see the issue necessarily as
one of financial resources but of a more supportive approach to reflect a
better appreciation of the potential value of overseas royal visits to the
economy.
But some in business were this week anxious to emphasise that the prince
himself will have to demonstrate a greater flexibility and readiness to
participate in more commercially-oriented overseas exercises.
The constraints placed on him by royal protocol were exposed this week, when
it emerged that the prince will be in Australia in January at the same time
as a business mission led by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary. They are unlikely to meet, however, because royal protocol
dictates that the prince cannot be seen to participate directly in trade
promotion in countries which recognise him as heir to the throne.
As one of his aides has emphasised: 'Though he can do his bit for Britain,
he is not a salesman.'
But according to one of Britain's most senior industrialists, who has
participated in numerous overseas trade missions, some of them involving the
prime minister: 'In the past, he (the prince) has proved extremely choosy
about the sort of missions abroad in which he is prepared to participate. He
generally only wants to take part in events directly linked to the
organisations he has helped start or in which he is directly involved. If
that attitude is now a thing of the past, it is very good news.'
Several in business this week quoted the example of the Duke of Kent,
vice-chairman of British Overseas Trade Board, as an example of how a
'hands-on' member of the royal family worked actively to assist the national
exporting effort. The duke, however, will not be the next king.
Another senior industrialist said: 'I see no good reason why the prince
should not head up trade missions in the same way the prime minister does.
He could not be expected to negotiate, but then neither is the prime
minister.
'We are talking about a modern monarchy trying to find a modern role. It
cannot have it both ways, simultaneously trying to cling to past
conventions.'

  [Text] Parliament Feb 28 SAPA -- The status and position of 
the Zulu king had to be elevated above party politics, and the 
monarchy secured through effective constitutional safeguards, 
the state president, Mr F W de Klerk, said on Monday [28 
February]. 
  Addressing a special session of Parliament, he said he 
understood the concerns of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his 
people on the future of the Zulu monarchy. The government and 
the National Party supported the view that the Zulu kingdom 
should be given constitutional recognition. "The Zulu kingdom 
is recognised by us as a unique reality. It has a proud history 
and plays an important role in the life of the Zulu nation." 
  Mr de Klerk said the monarchy could be secured either in a 
constitution for kwaZulu/Natal or in the national constitution, 
or both. The government had been involved in serious and 
in-depth discussions on the issue of the Zulu monarchy but no 
specific agreement had yet been reached. However, negotiation 
would continue until agreement was reached.
