<HEAD>Discount Chain's Founder Undergoes Cancer Therapy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Walton, the 71-year-old founder of
the Wal-Mart discount chain empire, has undergone treatment for
bone-marrow cancer, a company spokesman said Thursday.
   Walton, once the richest person in America, has received two
sessions of chemotherapy and some radiation therapy since Sunday
for multiple myeloma, said Don Shinkle, a Wal-mart spokesman.
   Myeloma is a malignant tumor in the bone marrow. It is generally
made up of abnormal plasma cells.
   A Wal-Mart statement said Walton was expected to recover fully
from treatment he underwent in Houston at M.D. Anderson Hospital.
   It is the second time Walton has faced cancer. In 1982, he was
diagnosed as having leukemia and also was treated at M.D. Anderson.
The leukemia has been in remission for several years.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the statement said.
   ``His doctors have advised him that they have had good success
treating this type of cancer if it's detected in time,'' Shinkle
said. ``He's in very good spirits.''
   Shinkle said Walton probably would spend another couple of weeks
in Houston. ``The bottom line, we hear from the doctors, is that
they caught this in time, in the early stages,'' he said.
   Walton had experienced aches and pains for several months, but
felt better after the therapy, Shinkle said.
   ``I feel so much better already,'' Walton said in a two-page
memo to Wal-Mart employees.
   Shinkle said the memo was issued because Walton wanted employees
to hear news of his illness from him, ``rather than have them to
hear a lot of rumors, because many might be exaggerated or untrue.''
   Shinkle said Walton may be initially slowed down, but that he
expects to resume visiting outlets in a few weeks, a common Walton
practice. After this week's treatments, Walton visited a Sam's
Wholesale Club in Houston.
   Walton has been known to drop in on local Wal-Mart managers with
little advance notice to stay in touch with the retail business at
the customer level.
   The memo also described Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, which Walton credited to the employees of the chain's 1,300
stores. It said Walton looked forward to more success.
   Based on his holdings of Wal-Mart stock, Walton has been listed
for the past several years by Forbes magazine as one of the
wealthiest men in the nation. He was the wealthiest until he split
his stock among family members.
   Walton stepped down as chief executive officer of the retail
chain in 1988, and chose David Glass to oversee the chain.
   The chain blossomed under Walton's philosophy of tight
management and general marketing principles that the customer is
always right.
   Born in Kingfisher, Okla., Walton grew up as the son of a
farm-mortgage banker. He graduated from the University of Missouri
with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a
management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa. After serving three years
in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin
five-and-dime. In 1962, Sam and his brother James L. Walton, opened
the first Wal-Mart Discount City.
   Three of his four grown children are involved with the company
in various capacities.

   Michaels Stores Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s three arts and crafts outlets for $2.3 million.

   The sale, which is expected to close at the end of the month, marks the end of Wal-Mart's dabbling in craft stores.
It started the Helen's Arts &amp; Crafts chain, named after the wife of Wal-Mart founder and chairman, Sam Walton, about four years ago.
The three Helen's stores are in Monroe, La.; Fort Smith, Ark.; and Springfield, Mo.

   Paul Carter, Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, said the stores were profitable but didn't mesh well with Wal-Mart's other stores, which emphasize high volume and low prices.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., owns Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Wholesale Clubs, a small chain of discount pharmacies and a new, gigantic discount grocery and general merchandise store called Hypermart.

   Michaels operates 97 crafts stores.

   Wal-Mart's Walton Predicts Company
   Could Quintuple Sales by the Year 2000

   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Saying he views his
multibillion-dollar retail empire as "just a small regional
company," Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chairman Sam M. Walton said he
thought the company could quintuple sales to about $125
billion by the year 2000.
   Last year, Wal-Mart's earnings increased 29% to $1 billion
on sales of $25.8 billion. If achieved, Mr. Walton's goals
for the end of the decade would boost the discount retailer
into the same league with corporate giants like General
Motors Corp., whose 1989 revenue was $126.9 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I really believe it's possible," Wal-Mart's 72-year-old
founder said at the annual meeting as he stood at the end of
a lighted walkway that extended into the middle of a
University of Arkansas sports arena. Though treated for a
form of cancer of the blood and bones earlier in the year,
the Arkansas billionaire had the fire and vigor of a revival
preacher as he led more than 8,000 shareholders and employees
in a series of call-and-response cheers.
   "Can we do it?" he shouted.
   "Yes we can," they roared back.
   Mr. Walton predicted the company would double the number
of Wal-Mart and Sam's Wholesale Club stores, increase both
their average size and annual sales and continue to expand
outside the company's traditional base in the South and
Midwest.
   By the end of the decade, he said he expects the number of
Wal-Mart stores to climb to about 3,000 from about 1,400 now
and their average size increase to about 80,000 square feet
from about 66,400 square feet. He predicted that Wal-Mart
store total sales would climb to about $96 billion annually
from about $21 billion last year and that per-square foot
sales would jump to $400 annually from about $250 last year.
   While talking little about the disappointing results at
the corporation's four huge Hypermart U.S.A. outlets, Mr.
Walton said he hoped that Sam's Wholesale Club outlets would
increase in number to about 300 from 127 and that Sam's
annual revenue would increase to about $30 billion from about
$4.8 billion last year.
   "It all rides on our people," said Mr. Walton, who added
that although Wal-Mart is "getting to be a large company, we
have to act small and move quickly."
   William W. Whyte, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in Little
Rock, Ark., said WalMart, which concentrates its operations
in small towns, could probably double its number of outlets
just by moving into new markets in the 28 states where it
already has operations.
   Noting innovations such as the company's recent efforts to
add discount grocery operations to some of its Wal-Mart
outlets, Mr. Whyte added that he would not be surprised if
Wal-Mart achieved the lofty goals laid out by its chairman
and founder. "They never cease to amaze me," he said. "With
them, we just take it one quarter at a time."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Wal-Mart jumped $2 to $58.375.

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., further
expanding its move into grocery retailing, said it agreed in
principle to acquire closely held Phillips Cos.
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. Phillips, also
based in Bentonville, operates 17 discount food stores and
three conventional supermarkets in the Arkansas area and will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart has been moving into grocery retailing in recent
years, most recently opening Wal-Mart Supercenters that
combine traditional Wal-Mart discount-store merchandise with
a grocery store. The company currently has six such stores
and plans to open nine more. In addition, Wal-Mart last year
purchased McLane Co., a wholesaler specializing in candy,
tobacco and snack-bar products based in Temple, Texas.
   A Wal-Mart spokesman said it wasn't yet clear whether
Wal-Mart will expand Phillips's grocery business. But he
said, "we're very interested in the employees of Phillips
Cos. and how they can make an immediate contribution" to
Wal-Mart and its supercenters.
   Wal-Mart already is somewhat familiar with Phillips. In
addition to operating nearby, the family interests of
Wal-Mart chairman Sam Walton once owned a stake in Phillips,
but Phillips purchased the stock back in July 1990.
   The discount retailer said the transaction is subject to a
definitive agreement and regulatory approval.

<TEXT>
   Maybe it's the immaculate rows of
discounted shampoo and paper towels, or the doorside hand-pumping
``people greeters'' who make visitors feel like they've entered a
sprawling mom-and-pop corner store.
   If the 97,000-square foot Waxahachie Wal-Mart is any indication
of the discount chain's operations in 26 states, it's not hard to
see why Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has staked a claim as the country's
dominant retailer, pleasing customers and sending nervous ripples
into the boardrooms of competitors.
   ``As for Wal-Mart becoming a household word, we never think about
things like that,'' David Glass, president and chief operating
officer, said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. ``What we want is for customers in our territories
to think of us fondly.''
   Local shopkeepers as well as giants like Sears, Roebuck and Co.
are watching Wal-Marts spurt like weeds and wondering whether some
of their business could be choked by a rival that religiously
pursues its corporate strategy with the fervor of a rural evangelist.
   Wal-Mart took root when Sam Walton and his brother Bud founded
the first Wal-Mart Discount City in Rogers, Ark. in 1962.
   Under Sam Walton, the company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s,
making his family worth billions and vaulting Wal-Mart to the
third-biggest U.S. retailer behind No.1 Sears and second-ranked K
mart Corp.
   At 70, Sam Walton remains involved. He has retained the title of
chairman although the company's day-to-day operations are handled by
Glass, 53.
   A visitor to a Wal-Mart immediately senses workers are aiming to
foster a friendly image, as though trying to preserve the charm
historically associated with the neighborhood shops that many retail
chains now threaten.
   When customers step inside an official greeter, sometimes in the
form of a hand-clasping retiree, ushers them in, offering advice or
just a ``how-do-you-do.''
   Regular Wal-Mart stores attempt to provide one-stop shopping for
consumers, stocking basic neccesities ranging from shoes and clothes
to televisions and outdoor grills.
   Three Wal-Mart supercenters and three hypermarts, marketing
experiments that are attracting hordes of customers, offer a wider
array of merchandise, such as full grocery lines.
   Within the Wal-Mart in Waxahachie, a community about 25 miles
south of Dallas, everything appears tidy with merchandise in its
proper place, typical of Wal-Marts elsewhere.
   Workers known as ``associates'' in the corporate patois, patrol
the floor, retrieving hangers, unwanted items and the clutter that
bargain-hunters sometimes leave behind.
   One of Waxahachie's assistant managers, Millie Wall, says
Wal-Mart encourages associates to be helpful. ``It might be beyond
what other discount stores do but I don't think it's beyond
Wal-Mart,'' she says.
   What really draws customers, though, is price.
   ``You can find the same stuff at Wal-Mart that you can find at
other stores but cheaper,'' says Wal-Mart regular Cheryl Starks
while lunching with three of her four children at a McDonald's near
the Wal-Mart in the east Texas town of Gilmer. ``The clothes we have
on came from Wal-Mart, the shoes we have on came from Wal-Mart.''
   In the Wal-Mart she frequents, a 16 ounce bottle of Suave balsam
and protein shampoo was selling for $1.08 while the supermarket a
few doors away in the same mall offered the same for $1.69. Four
rolls of Charmin toilet tissue went for 96 cents in Wal-Mart vs.
$1.45 at the supermarket. Bounty designer kitchen towels were 78
cents in Wal-Mart and $1.07 in the store nearby.
   Wal-Mart's flag-waving patriotism also seems to have struck a
responsive chord in the small towns and cities in the heartland,
where the chain has multiplied. Anecdotal evidence suggests the
company has won customers through publicity programs such as its
``Buy American'' pitch.
   If there's one big criticism, it's that local merchants _
especially small shops that can't buy in the volume that allows
Wal-Mart to keep prices low _ get blown away when Wal-Marts move in.
   Kenneth E. Stone, an economics professor at Iowa State
University, looked into the impact of Wal-Marts after chambers of
commerce and business people expressed concern about the
consequences of new Wal-Marts in their areas.
   Stone's conclusions were mixed. Retail trade will expand,
boosting business for some local merchants but causing others to
lose sales, he found.
   The bottom line, Stone's study shows, is that a strategy should
be developed ``for existing merchants so that they may better
co-exist in a Wal-Mart environment.''
   Glass concedes Wal-Marts can make big economic waves. He says
some businesses may flee from their competitive might, but overall,
the chain tends to benefit areas by drawing customers to many stores.
   ``In the aggregate, I would argue that we have a good impact on a
community by making it a trade center, a place where people come to
shop,'' he says.
   Wall Streeters praise Wal-Mart, especially the chain's
application of computer technology to most routine retailing tasks,
including inventory control.
   The past decade is the best evidence of Wal-Mart's phenomenal
growth. As of Jan. 31, the company ran 1,259 Wal-Mart stores, 105
Sam's Wholesale Clubs _ outlets for shoppers buying in bulk _ and
about two dozen other retail operations. At the start of 1979,
Wal-Mart ran 276 stores.
   This year, the company plans to open 155 Wal-Marts and 20
wholesale clubs. The opening of new stores has helped maintain
momentum in sales growth, which was 29 percent in 1988 when sales
rose to $20.65 billion from $15.96 billion.
   Earnings last year totaled $837 million, or $1.48 a share, vs.
$628 million or $1.11 a share a year earlier.
   The company's ambitious plans have expanded to the concept of
supercenters and hypermarts, which are huge mega-merchandizing
emporia with everything from groceries to computer software under
one roof.
   Judging from Wal-Mart's stock market performance, the company has
faithful followers. One analyst estimates the price of a Wal-Mart
share will rise to $49 this year from about $32 recently.
   On the cost side, the corporation is known for dealing shrewdly
with suppliers for the best possible price. Its operating expenses,
as a proportion of sales, are the lowest industrywide.
   In a recent report on the company, Walter F. Loeb of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. had nothing bad to say.
   ``The customer is key to the success of Wal-Mart. Management is
insisting that every customer be treated as a guest in Wal-Mart
stores,'' Loeb wrote.
   ``This unique attitude is producing a strong response from
consumers since service with a smile is often a forgotten commodity
in retailing.''

<TEXT>
   In the Wal-Mart parking lot, a car radio
plays a country ballad about a relaxed, ``porch swing state of
mind.'' Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn dogs and
cold soda.
   Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off
the small merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says, ``Mommy's
got to go shopping now.''
   Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the
store. Her pout gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets the
child with a ``Hi honey!'' while fixing a happy-face sticker on her
hand.
   Anyone entering the Wal-Mart in this east Texas town _ and
Wal-Marts elsewhere _ encounters such a person. The people greeters
welcome shoppers, give advice on where to find things and mark
merchandise carried in for returns or exchanges.
   On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for
coming while keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure people
aren't shoplifting.
   The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s highly successful retailing recipe.
   Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other
retailers, particularly at discounters that have heavy traffic. What
sets Wal-Marts appart is the way they handle the task.
   Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied by employees
demanding that they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance.
Not in Wal-Marts.
   Wal-Mart ``associates,'' the term the company has substituted for
employees, give the impression that the security element of
people-greeting is secondary to acting like a friendly host or
hostess. They appear to genuinely enjoy passing the time with
patrons.
   ``I get to see everybody who comes to Wal-Mart and everybody in
Upshur County comes to Wal-Mart sooner or later,'' says Peggy Smith
while on duty at the entrance of the Gilmer Wal-Mart.
   Smith, a 39-year-old Gilmer resident who won an award for being
the most courteous employee in the county in February, speaks
proudly about working at Wal-Mart.
   She's grateful to have the job. Other people living in the area
of Gilmer, a town of an estimated 6,500 people about 120 miles east
of Dallas and the Upshur County seat, are less fortunate due to deep
staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged slump in the
state's oil industry.
   Wal-Mart store managers say not all associates are suited for
people-greeting duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful
personality traits are patience and perhaps a touch of
inquisitiveness, some say.
   Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found
doing stints on Wal-Mart's hospitality patrol.
   One of them, 68-year-old Jack Butler, says being a people greeter
at the Wal-Mart in Duncanville, Texas, fits his needs fine. After
20{ years working in the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys
less physically-demanding work.
   Deploying someone at Wal-Mart doors originated with one of the
hourly associates. Sam Walton, company founder and chairman, liked
the suggestion and it became a company-wide practice.

   Forty years after Sam Walton first hung
out his shingle, Walton's 5&amp;10 will reopen to show how a little
rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the
same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for
business on May 9, 1950.
   The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing
discount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations. It
concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how
Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.
   The window displays date back to the store's opening, with
Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some
Ivory Snow. Inside, an electronic map details the company's
1,500-plus store chain today.
   Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton
donned for his ``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after
challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit
in 1984. The goal was accomplished and he danced.
   The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of
the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of
Detroit.
   Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount
City in 1962. Both will be on hand for the opening, along with a
sprinkling of other dignitaries, including Gov. Bill Clinton, the
dedication speaker.
   Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also
has a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store,
including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.
   Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-faced
baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s. Typical of the Wal-Mart
outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed ``a place to grow and to
dream'' in a video on the Walton family.
   After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a Ben
Franklin store in Newport in 1945. He lost the lease on that one,
and relocated to Bentonville. That's where the story took off.
   Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, to
take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.
   Walton ``said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores'' and
needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his
brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent
interview.
   That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's ``learn as you go''
training program.
   ``I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxing
the floor with Sam,'' Bogle said.
   Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story. In one
video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of
Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the
opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.
The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.
   ``I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount
store, or retail store, I have ever seen,'' said Glass, who was
president of a drugstore chain at the time.
   And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when
Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to
Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there ``just really
didn't see a future in it.''
   Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public
affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the
term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart
employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's
leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right
time.''
   At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed
272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion. Sam's Wholesale Club
closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to
enter the California market.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Tuesday reported a 22 percent gain in its
second-quarter profit, reflecting strong sales growth and inventory
control.
   Wal-Mart, a discounter that is the country's third biggest
retailer, said its income rose to $219 million, or 39 cents a
share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $179.6 million, or 32
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 25 percent to $6.05
billion from $4.85 billion.
   Commenting on the performance, David Glass, Wal-Mart's president
and chief executive officer, said: ``Well-managed inventory levels,
better customer service, and solid sales momentum position us to
meet our sales and earnings objectives for the remaining six months
of this year.''
   In the first six months, Wal-Mart earned $417.3 million, or 74
cents a share, up 25 percent from $333.2 million, or 59 cents a
share, in the first half of 1988. Sales totaled $11.42 billion, up
25 percent from $9.13 bllion.
   Wal-Mart, which ranks after Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K mart
Corp., said it opened 28 new Wal-Mart stores and 3 Sam's Wholesale
clubs during the second quarter.
   The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., operates a total of
1,307 Wal-Mart stores, 109 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot Discount
Drug stores and 3 Hypermart USA units.

<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Thursday
reported 25 percent growth in its second-quarter profit on a 25
percent sales gain.
   The fast-growing discounter, based in Bentonville, Ark., earned
$272.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the three months ended July
31, up from $219 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales grew to $7.54 billion in the retailer's fiscal 1990 second
quarter from $6.05 billion a year before.
   David Glass, president and chief executive officer, credited the
company's merchandising strategy for producing the profit
improvement.
   ``Our customers continue to support our efforts to serve them
with quality merchandise and service,'' he said in a news release.
   But he said that forecasts for the second half of the year ``are
characterized by anticipated economic uncertainty.''
   Wal-Mart has bucked the slowing trend in the retail industry
this year and has consistently outperformed its competitors. The
discounter might pass Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K mart Corp. this
year in annual sales volume, industry analysts say. Sears and K
mart are the nation's first- and second-ranked retailers,
respectively.
   Also on Thursday, Wal-Mart reported its sales for July, which
exceeded the gains posted by most other major general merchandise
chains. Last month sales rose 21 percent to $2.4 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier. Sales at Wal-Mart-owned stores open a year
or longer rose 8 percent.
   For the first half of its year, Wal-Mart earned $526 million, or
46 cents a share, up 26 percent from $417 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales for the first half amounted to $14.31
billion, up 25 percent from $11.42 billion in 1989's first half.
   Wal-Mart opened two new distribution centers and completed a
third during the second quarter, resulting in an addition of
3,110,620 square feet of distribution space.
   In the quarter, 18 new Wal-Mart stores and four Sam's Wholesale
Clubs were opened. For the year, the company has opened 36 Wal-Mart
stores, nine Sam's and one Hypermart USA.
   Wal-Mart operates in 30 states.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said profit rose 27% for its fiscal
second quarter.
   For the quarter ended July 31, profit rose to $345.9

<TEXT>
   The Bentonville, Ark., discount retailer's earnings were
slightly better than many Wall Street analysts' forecast of
29 cents a share for the quarter. Analysts attributed the
gains to strong sales growth at Wal-Mart discount stores and
Sam's Club warehouse outlets.
   While sales at stores open more than a year grew an
average 2.2% in July for 14 large U.S. retailers, Wal-Mart's
samestore sales jumped 13%, said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail
analyst for Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. Mr. Buchanan attributed
the strong sales, in part, to Wal-Mart's store locations in
regions such as the Southwest and Southeast, which are
weathering the recession better than the coasts.
   The company also continued its rapid expansion, opening 36
Wal-Mart stores and six Sam's Clubs during the quarter. In
late New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Wal-Mart's stock was quoted at $48.875, up 75 cents.

Comeback</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: rewrites throughout with Limited results.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede BENTONVILLE, Ark.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a surge in first-quarter earnings
and sales Tuesday, attributing the performance to the fast-growing
chain's improvements in costs and inventory management.
   Meanwhile, Limited Inc., a leading apparel retailer, said its
first-quarter earnings soared 89 percent over the lackluster
results of a year earlier.
   Wal-Mart, the nation's No. 3 retailer behind Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and K mart Corp. said earnings for the three months ended April
30 totaled $198.29 million or 35 cents a share, a 29 percent jump
over the $153.5 million or 27 cents a share reported in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Sales totaled $5.37 billion, a 25 percent jump over the $4.31
billion figure a year earlier.
   As of April 30, the Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart operated
1,279 Wal-Mart stores, 106 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot Discount
Drug stores and three Hypermart USA units. A year earlier, the
company had 1,144 Wal-Mart stores, 86 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot
Discount Drug stores and one Hypermart USA unit.
   ``First quarter sales, driven by improved apparel sales and
basic in-stock positions, ran above plan throughout the period,''
David Glass, Wal-Mart president and chief executive officer, said
in a release. ``Improved expense control and better inventory
management converted this positive sales trend to good earnings
results.
   ``Our aggressive sales and earnings plans for the balance of the
year can now be pursued with this sound first quarter as our
foundation,'' he said.
   Limited reported first-quarter net income of $45.2 million, or
25 cents per share, up from $23.9 million, or 13 cents per share, a
year earlier.
   The Columbus, Ohio-based company reported first-quarter sales of
$964.6 million, up from $811.1 million in the first three months of
1988, when it and other apparel retailers were in the midst of a
year-long slump.
   ``We are pleased with our first-quarter increases, achieved in
what I still believe to be a lackluster environment,'' Chairman
Leslie H. Wexner said in a statement.
   Limited operates 3,411 apparel stores, including Limited,
Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane Bryant,
Lerner Woman and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The company also operates
mail order businesses under the Brylane and Victoria's Secret names.

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it settled
a lawsuit with a trade union and agreed to make additional
disclosures about certain tranasctions between the company
and relatives of Chairman Sam Walton.
   The Food and Allied Service Trades department of the
AFL-CIO said the retailer agreed to make a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and issue a news release
disclosing transactions between Wal-Mart and a fan company
owned by Mr. Walton and his family. It also will disclose a
shopping center lease between Wal-Mart and E. Stanley
Kroenke, the son-in-law of James L. Walton, a company
director and Mr. Walton's brother.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trade union, which owns 20 Wal-Mart shares, last week
sued the company, charging that it failed to disclose a
number of related-party transactions.
   After the suit was filed, Wal-Mart sent shareholders
supplementary proxy material disclosing the suit and its
charges. It also said it had disclosed in an earlier SEC
filing that during the year ended Jan. 31, Mr. Kroenke had
ownership interests in shopping centers that leased space for
27 Wal-Mart stores. It said it paid $6.3 million in rents and
maintenance fees for the leases, of which Mr. Kroenke's
interest was $3.8 million.
   Wal-Mart also said that Frank Robson, Sam Walton's
brother-in-law, had ownership interests in store locations
and that his shares of rents and maintenance fees totalled
$2.5 million. Further, it said Mr. Robson paid Wal-Mart
$308,897 in principal and interest under four notes. Mr.
Robson owed the company $2 million at April 30 for loans to
expand four store locations.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Tuesday it
had record sales and profits for the fourth quarter and for the
year ended Jan. 31.
   Wal-Mart said its fourth-quarter net income increased 32 percent
to $425.9 million, or 75 cents a share, from $323.2 million, or 57
cents a share, in the final quarter of 1988.
   Sales totaled $8.1 billion compared with $6.5 billion a year
earlier, a gain of 24 percent.
   For the year, the nation's third-largest discount retailer said
its earnings jumped 28.5 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.90 a share,
from $837 million, or $1.48 a share, the year before. Sales rose to
$25 billion, up 25 percent from $20.6 billion.
   ``We are extremely pleased to report another record year of
sales and earnings,'' David Glass, Wal-Mart president and chief
executive officer, said in a written statement. ``We remain
committed to our everyday low-pricing program on name-brand
merchandise while working to exceed our customer's expectations of
service.''
   As of Jan. 31, the company operated 1,402 Wal-Mart stores, 123
Sam's Wholesale Clubs and three Hypermart-USA units compared with
1,259 Wal-Mart stores, 105 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot Discount
Drug stores and one Hypermart-USA unit at the same time last year.
The sale of the dot Discount Drug stores was effective Feb. 1.
   Glass said the company's 1990 plans call for aggressive
expansion.
   ``We believe the new year will be an intensively competitive
environment but should provide a great opportunity for us to
perform in a manner consistent with prior years,'' he said.
   Wal-Mart operates in 29 states.

<HEAD>Lawyers Argue Wal-Mart Sanctions Case Before Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. asked
an appeals court Thursday to overturn a lower court's ruling that
the company pay as much as $1 million a day because its billionaire
chairman Sam Walton did not show up for a deposition.
   The 2nd Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the case, a court
official said.
   The sanctions resulted from a personal injury lawsuit filed by
Andrew Carrizales against Wal-Mart and manager Jerry Rand.
Carrizales claims that while shopping at the company's Sulphur
Springs store in 1986 he slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on
the floor.
   Carrizales says he suffered mental anguish and ``serious and
disabling'' injuries to his arms, legs and back, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported.
   Wallace Craig, Carrizales' attorney, said Wal-Mart was ordered to
produce Walton, who is also Wal-Mart's chief executive officer, for
a videotaped deposition in Bentonville, Ark., at the company's main
offices on Aug. 8.
   However, Walton's attorney petitioned a district judge in Benton
County in Arkansas to overrule the order of 352nd District Judge
John Street and requested the deposition be overseen by an Arkansas
court.
   Craig said he had no objections to conducting the deposition at
the Wal-Mart offices, but said he did not believe the testimony
would be admissible if it were taken by an Arkansas court reporter.
He also said the case is not under the jurisdiction of Arkansas
courts.
   ``I wanted to take his deposition where I was supposed to, and he
refused,'' Craig said.
   Street later ordered Wal-Mart to have Walton at the Fort Worth
court on Nov. 28 for a deposition or pay Carrizales for each day he
didn't show up.
   ``Walton ... has shown an arrogant disregard for the authority of
this court,'' the judge's ruling said. ``As chairman of the board of
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walton owed the duties of obedience and loyal
behavior'' to the corporation to appear for the deposition.
   Street also ordered Wal-Mart's pleadings in the case stricken,
thereby knocking out the company's defenses in the suit, Craig said.
   Wal-Mart was ordered by Street to pay the plaintiff $10,000 for
the first day he did not appear; $20,000 for the second; $40,000 for
the third; $80,000 for the fourth; $160,000 for the fifth; $320,000
for the sixth; $640,000 for the seventh; $1.28 million for the
eighth; and $1 million a day for each day afterward.
   The appeals court stayed that order before Walton was scheduled
to appear in Fort Worth, Wal-Mart attorney Vic Anderson said, and
Thursday's appellate hearing was scheduled.
   Anderson said Texas law states that anyone who is not a party in
a lawsuit is able to provide a deposition in that case where they
live. Anderson declined to comment on the legal aspects of the suit.
   Craig said the personal injury suit is scheduled to go to trial
Monday.

<HEAD>Family Seeks Restructuring of Stock-Holding Method</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of the man who founded the
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. discount chain wants to restructure the way
they hold company stock, which could result in substantial tax
benefits, according to the company's proxy report.
   The Walton family members now hold 218 million Wal-Mart shares,
worth about $7.7 billion, as owners of a Delaware corporation
called Walton Enterprises that actually holds the stock. The
individual Waltons _ company founder Sam Walton and his four
children, S. Robson, John T., Jim C. and Alice L. _ own roughly
equal shares of Walton Enterprises.
   The recently released Wal-Mart proxy report says the family has
proposed to hold ownership of the Wal-Mart shares through a
partnership instead of a corporation. The report said family
members ``may obtain very substantial future tax advantages'' by
changing their holding method to a partnership.
   To do that, the Waltons have proposed an exchange of stock with
Wal-Mart Stores, provided that there is a tax ruling that the
exchange itself would not be taxed. The Wal-Mart board has named a
committee of its independent directors to review the proposed
exchange and negotiate its terms.
   Little Rock tax lawyer George Plastiras said tax laws would
apply differently to Wal-Mart stock held in a partnership instead
of through a corporation if there later is a distribution of the
stock to individual partners, upon dissolution of the partnership,
or to Walton Enterprises stockholders if it were dissolved as a
corporation.
   ``They can dissolve the partnership in a non-taxable event,''
Plastiras said.
   Woody Whyte, an analyst for the Little Rock investment banking
firm Staephens Inc., said the proposal ``has nothing to do with the
(Wal-Mart) company'' as such. The Walton-controlled stock still
would be controlled by the Waltons, he said.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it will acquire Cullum Cos.' share of the two companies' Hypermart USA joint venture on Oct. 1.

   Terms weren't disclosed.

   Wal-Mart, a giant discount retailer based in Bentonville, Ark., and Cullum, a regional grocery and drugstore chain, agreed three years ago to build the European-style hypermarket stores in the Dallas area to test the market for a mammoth grocery and discount-goods store.
The companies opened a store in Garland, Texas, in late 1987 and a store in Arlington, Texas, in mid-1988.

   At the time, the companies said Cullum would bring expertise in grocery-store management and Wal-Mart would bring general-merchandise experience to the joint venture.
But last year, Cullum went private in a $380 million leveraged buy-out, and it has been trying to sell some assets to reduce its debt, which was $443 million at April 1.

   Cullum also said it wants to focus its efforts on expanding its Tom Thumb grocery stores and its Page Drug outlets.
The company, which has sold about nine of its stores since the leveraged buy-out, said it will use the proceeds from its share of the joint venture to repay debt.

   Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has expanded the hypermart concept on its own, opening a Hypermart USA store in Topeka, Kan., last year, and it is preparing to open a Kansas City, Mo., store in early 1990.
It also has opened Wal-Mart Supercenters, which combine a grocery store with a WalMart discount store.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wal-Mart shares closed at $41.125, down 87.5 cents.

   The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this
community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing
phenomenon.
   Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary
telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring
him to the De Soto store.
   Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in
close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by
other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of
time in the field.
   Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas
metropolitan area, ``It's not like `uh-oh, someone's coming,'
because they're always out.''
   By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations
throughout the company.
   Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer
David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the
gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
   To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing; ``Rule No.1 is
the customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just in case the
customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.''
   If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are
because that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.
   He shuns the limlight that his company's success has shed on him
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.
   He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.
   He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that
hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via
high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.
   Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company
effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union
organizing effort in the late 1960s.
   One of the most sensitive subjects for him is the fortune he's
amassed. A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything''
not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's
wealthiest people. The magazine has estimated that his immediate
family's stake in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.
   ``Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his
bank account,'' says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.
   Samuel Moore Walton turns 71 on March 29. He was born in
Kingfisher, Okla. and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.
   He graduated the University of Missouri with an economics degree
in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in Des
Moines, Iowa. After serving three years in the Army, he went to
Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually
becoming the company's biggest franchisee.
   The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his
brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in
1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.
retail trade.
   Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.
Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had are
involved with the company in various capacities.
   Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as
ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with
leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since
handing over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam is still
chairman of the board.
   Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourish
without Sam. The answer is an emphatic yes because ``We have great
people,'' he says. The Walton family will always be involved, he
adds.
   Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what
we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won't
matter.''

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continuing its rapid growth, said net income grew 34% for the second quarter ended July 31, to $179.6 million, or 32 cents a share, from $134.1 million, or 24 cents a share.

   The Bentonville, Ark.-based discount chain attributed the gain to its ability to lower prices at its Wal-Mart stores and the stores' increasing market share.
The lower prices, it said, stem from strict control of expenses and tax savings under new tax laws that were passed along to consumers.

   Analysts also credited a strong performance at the company's Sam's Wholesale Club unit for the increase.
Sam's last year acquired another membership-warehouse chain and this year has closed three overlapping stores.

   Sales for the quarter increased 29.8%, to $4.85 billion from $3.73 billion last year.

   For the six months, Wal-Mart said its net income rose 36.3%, to $333.2 million, or 59 cents a share, from $244.5 million, or 43 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
Sales were $9.13 billion, up 31.4% from $6.94 billion last year.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported net income for its fiscal second quarter ended July 31 rose 40% to $134.1 million, or 24 cents a share, from $95.9 million, or 17 cents a share, a year ago.

   Sales of the discount retailer increased 35% to $3.73 billion from $2.77 billion.

   For the six months, net income jumped 44% to $244.5 million, or 43 cents a share, from $169.3 million, or 30 cents a share.
Sales increased 35% to $6.94 billion from $5.11 billion.

   Sam Walton, chairman, said Wal-Mart's results were "above-budget" and that the chain is "well-positioned to meet our objectives for the remaining six months of this year."

   In the second quarter, the company opened 27 new Wal-Mart stores, 21 Sam's Wholesale Clubs and two dot Discount Drug stores.

   Wal-Mart shares closed yesterday at $42, up $1.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   WASHINGTON -- A union shareholder said it sued Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. in federal court here, charging that the giant
discounter failed to disclose in its proxy statement certain
transactions between Chairman Sam Walton and his family.
   The Food and Allied Service Trades Department of the
AFL-CIO, which said it owns 20 Wal-Mart shares, asked the
court to require Wal-Mart to correct its proxy statement and
to enjoin shareholders from voting on the current proxy
information. The company's annual meeting is scheduled for
June 7.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its lawsuit, the group charged that the company has
tried to deceive shareholders by failing to make full
disclosure of certain relationships. For instance, the
lawsuit charges that Wal-Mart leased properties owned by the
son-in-law of James L. Walton, a Wal-Mart director and senior
vice president and brother of the company's Chairman Sam
Walton, and also leased properties from Sam Walton's
brother-in-law.
   Wal-Mart also failed to disclose that it purchased fans
from a company owned by Walton Enterprises, which is partly
owned by Sam Walton and his son S. Robson Walton, a company
director, the suit said. In addition, the lawsuit said that
the company should have disclosed that Walton Enterprises
owns a substantial stake in Bank of Bentonville, which is
trustee for four Wal-Mart benefit plans.
   Robert Rhoads, Wal-Mart general counsel, said the company,
as a matter of policy, doesn't comment on litigation.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has entered into a
merger agreement to acquire The Wholesale Club Inc. for about $170
million, the companies announced Tuesday.
   Wal-Mart President David Glass said the Wholesale Club's outlets
and operations would complement Wal-Mart's Sam's Wholesale Club
Division and give the discount chain a significant presence in new
markets.
   The Wholesale Club operates 27 membership clubs in six states.
Sales for the six-month period ended Aug. 4 totaled $333 million.
   Wal-Mart operates 141 Sam's Wholesale outlets and 1,503 Wal-Mart
discount stores in 34 states.
   A statement by the companies said Wal-Mart would acquire The
Wholesale Club for the equivalent of $21 a share. With about 8
million shares outstanding, the deal is worth $170 million, said a
spokesman for The Wholesale Club.
   The Wholesale Club shareholders will have the option of
receiving either Wal-Mart common stock or cash for their common
stock, subject to the limitation that not more than 20 percent of
the aggregate may be paid in cash.
   The deal is subject to approval by The Wholesale Club's
shareholders and other conditions.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is making its first
foray into New England with five discount stores planned in New
Hampshire and a wholesale club scheduled to open in Maine.
   Patrick Peery, Wal-Mart's real estate manager, said Tuesday the
retailer chose New Hampshire as the site for the discount stores
because the state has no sales tax.
   The new Wal-Marts will be located near the borders of
Massachusetts and Maine to take advantage of shoppers from those
states who come to New Hampshire to avoid their states' sales
taxes, Peery said.
   The stores will be in Somersworth, Amherst, Derry, Seabrook and
Hooksett.
   Wal-Mart also said it would open a Sam's Wholesale Club in
Scarborough, Maine. Sam's Clubs are cash-and-carry warehouses open
to managers and owners of other stores and to groups such as
retirees.
   Wal-Mart, based largely in the Sunbelt and the Midwest, operates
1,527 discount stores in 35 states, including 146 Sam's Wholesale
Clubs and four Hypermart-USA stores.
   The company is the nation's third-largest retailer, behind
Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Kmart Corp.

   A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unit evicted from the parking lots
of 24 of its Texas stores a hot-dog vendor and her elderly,
handicapped work force, according to the vendor, Scarlett
Rabalais.
   The move represents the latest salvo in a year-long battle
between the nation's largest retailer and Ms. Rabalais, who
five years ago introduced the concept of selling hot dogs at
Wal-Mart's Sam's Clubs in Texas as a way of employing the
disabled. Since then, Ms. Rabalais' Houston company, Hot
Diggity Dogs, has won a number of awards for its employment
of the underprivileged.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But according to Ms. Rabalais, the little company also
demonstrated that the concept was financially viable --
giving Wal-Mart the desire to run its own stands at Sam's.
Although she gives the company a 10% cut of sales, she
concedes Wal-Mart probably earns more at the Sam's locations
outside Texas, where it operates its own stands.
   Last year, Sam's ordered Ms. Rabalais's hot-dog stands off
its Texas lots, then reversed its position after the media
publicized the implications of that order for the 92 elderly
and handicapped employees of Hot Diggity Dogs.
   Subsequently, Ms. Rabalais said, she and the company
failed after several attempts to negotiate a long-term
contract, prompting her to sue Wal-Mart in June.
   Ms. Rabalais said the eviction decision apparently was
prompted by her appearance this week on Hard Copy, the
national TV news program, during which she appealed to
Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton to let her and her workers stay
on Sam's lots.
   In Bentonville, Ark., Brenda Lockhart, a spokeswoman for
Sam's, which operates more than 150 stores nationwide, said
in a prepared statement that, "Since the action is in
litigation, we feel it's most proper to let the situation be
handled in court rather than in the news media."

<TEXT>
   Sam M. Walton, the legendary retailer who once danced the hula on Wall Street when profit waltzed past forecasts, gave up his title as chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

   Mr. Walton, about two months away from his 70th birthday, handed the job to his much-anticipated successor, David D. Glass, who served most recently as president and chief operating officer of Wal-Mart, the nation's third largest retailer.
Mr. Glass, 52 years old, combines formal finance training and a stint as the Wal-Mart's chief financial officer with broad merchandising and operations experience.
Mr. Walton will remain chairman.

   Mr. Glass's elevation coincided with the retirement of Jack Shewmaker, a vice chairman and chief financial officer.
Mr. Shewmaker was once seen as a rival to Mr. Glass for the top post, but recently had receded as a potential heir apparent.
Mr. Shewmaker, 50, remains on the board of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and said he will serve as a consultant with a multiyear contract.
He declined to discuss whether his departure was prompted by Mr. Glass's appointment, but people who know both men said it was unlikely that either one would have been content working for the other.

   The top level changes precipitated promotions and job changes for seven other Wal-Mart executives, but no one seemed surprised by the selections.
Most also felt the changes would signal little change at the fast-growing company.
Mr. Walton "is relinquishing his title not his person," said Walter F. Loeb, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst.
"He will be in the stores as in the past, and making sure people are happy."
In a statement, Mr. Walton said he plans "to participate and be as active and involved as always."
Mr. Walton and his family are the company's biggest shareholders with about a 40% stake, according to last year's proxy materials.

   Mr. Glass said in an interview that he and Mr. Walton shared the same retailing principles and that he didn't plan any major changes at Wal-Mart.
He conceded that he doesn't possess Mr. Walton's flair although he did stage the billionaire's Wall Street hula performance several years ago and walked a pig down a Dallas street after the company met other profit goals in 1986.
"Sam is one of a kind," Mr. Glass said, adding that he wasn't "going to dance the hula on Wall Street."

   In a separate interview, Mr. Shewmaker said he was retiring because "I have a lot of money and I have a lot of interests I want to pursue."
Mr. Shewmaker, who is popular with Wal-Mart's store managers, is a millionare with extensive real estate holdings and a cattle breeding operation.

   Mr. Walton's business associates said he had been hinting recently at giving up the chief executive duties -- a post he'd held since 1962.
The company runs largely without his presence at headquarters.
Mr. Walton travels extensively, each week visiting stores in the chain's 24-state market, and returns for traditional Saturday meetings to review operations and field reports.
He is expected to continue to do so.

   Mr. Glass clearly had been successfully tested for the top job since being named in 1984 as president and operating chief in in a job switch with Mr. Shewmaker.
"David has exhibited excellent leadership and management skills," Mr. Walton said yesterday.

   Assisting Mr. Glass will be Donald G. Sonderquist, 54, who was named chief operating officer and a vice chairman.
Mr. Sonderquist formerly was executive vice president of operations and administration.
Paul R. Carter, an executive vice president, finance, was named chief financial officer, and will be nominated to Wal-Mart's board.
Wal-Mart said Al Johnson, executive vice president, merchandise and sales, also was named a vice chairman.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart Earnings Up 22 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Thursday its
third-quarter earnings rose 22 percent as the retailer continued to
thrive despite a slowdown in consumer spending.
   Wal-Mart said it earned $282.8 million, or 25 cents per share,
in the quarter ended Oct. 31, up from $232.7 million, or 20 cents
per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales at the Bentonville, Ark.-based company rose 26 percent to
$7.93 billion from $6.28 billion.
   Other retailers saw their sales slump during the quarter as
consumer confidence was shaken by the weakening economy and the
Persian Gulf crisis. Wal-Mart, which has outperformed the retail
industry for years, continued to do so in spite of the poor
environment.
   David Glass, Wal-Mart's president, said the company met its
goals for the quarter and for the first nine months of its fiscal
year.
   Wal-Mart earned $809.2 million, or 71 cents per share, for the
nine months ended Oct. 31, up from $650 million, or 57 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales totaled $22.24 billion, up from $17.7 billion.
   The company has 1,503 Wal-Mart discount stores, 141 Sam's
wholesale clubs and four Hypermart USA stores in 34 states.

<HEADLINE>  AT WAL-MART, GROWTH IS STILL NO. 1 PRODUCT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Shorter version ran on page 13D of the Stock Final edition  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There's only one company in the world that sports those numbers, and this
one is based in Bentonville, Ark., and goes by the name of Wal-Mart Stores.;
How happy are the shareholders?;   The stock, which has split two-for-one
twice in the last five years, was selling for $8 a share in 1986. It is now
around $46. While the company chooses to pump most of its profits back into
operations, it does pay a small dividend that has been growing like everything
else at Wal-Mart. The payout to shareholders has increased from 4 cents a
share in 1986 to 17 cents today.;   Corporate insiders, principally founder
Sam Walton, own 42 percent of the company's shares, which significantly
reduces the amount of stock that's available to the public.;   The company's
goal is to achieve $100 billion in sales from the Wal-Mart stores by the end
of the decade, and $30 billion from its Sam's Clubs. That would amount to a
four-fold increase during the 1990s.;   New store expansion will represent the
majority of the growth, since Wal-Mart is still a regional company and is just
beginning to enter the major population centers of California and the
Northeast. Currently, it has discount store locations in 37 states.;   In its
recent analysis of Wal-Mart, the brokerage house of Interstate/Johnson Lane of
Charlotte, N.C., said, "We believe the ingredients of Wal-Mart's incredible
success are not limited by its size, but only by its own desires, which we
think are as strong as ever.";   Sam's Club has become the leading company in
the rapidly expanding membership warehouse industry, perhaps the most
significant new development in retailing in recent years.;   The brokerage
also points out that Wal-Mart has begun to roll out a new growth vehicle, the
Wal-Mart Supercenter, which combines a Wal-Mart discount store with groceries.
"We also expect further benefits for customers as well as shareholders from
the company's 'Buy American' program, which has converted $5 billion of sales
from foreign to domestic sources and created or saved more than 80,000 jobs,"
Interstate/Johnson said.;   Wal-Mart's shares are trading at 34 times the
firm's earnings estimate of $1.40 per share for the year ending January 1992,
and 27 times its projection of $1.75 per share for the next year.;   Although
that puts Wal-Mart at the upper end of valuations compared with the Standard &amp;
Poor's index, it is consistent with the stock's experience over the last five
years.;   Says Interstate/Johnson, "We believe the premium valuation is well
deserved given the company's growth prospects, which are among the most
promising in the retailing industry. Wal-Mart's growth is likely to be
maintained at an annual rate of 25 percent or more for the next several years,
while profitability as measured by return on equity of more than 30 percent is
the highest of any general merchandise retailer in the United States.;   "We
recommend purchase of the shares in growth-oriented accounts. Our 12-month
price target is $60 per share, and we believe significant appreciation
potential exists in future years as well.";   But not everyone thinks Wal-Mart
is the place to be as the market hovers around record highs.;   Dean Witter
analysts say a little caution may be in order and rate the stock no better
than a hold, calling the stock reasonably valued on an absolute price-earnings
and dividend yield basis.;   "We continue to regard Wal-Mart as America's
premier growth retailer. The company's unique culture and significant cost
advantage over its competitors position the chain well for what will most
certainly be a challenging period ahead," Dean Witter said.;   Value Line
gives Wal-Mart its top rating for timeliness and its second highest ranking
for safety, the highest overall ranking for any of the 26 retailers it
covers.;   Value Line estimates the company will earn $1.38 a share this year
and $1.70 in 1992, "although these are likely to prove understated if the
economy picks up enough steam to buoy new employment to the point of loosening
consumer purse strings."  </TEXT>

   Retailing:
   Wal-Mart's Store of the Future Blends
   Discount Prices, Department-Store Feel

   ROGERS, Ark. -- When Sam Walton opened the first Wal-Mart
discount store here in 1962, the retail industry didn't
notice. Twenty-nine years later, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. hopes
its new store here will likewise escape attention.
   Never mind that Wal-Mart, newly anointed as the nation's
largest retailer, with fiscal 1991 sales of $33 billion, can
scarcely sell a pair of slacks these days without drawing a
curious crowd. Citing competitive concerns, the company
declines to discuss its new store, which features innovations
and strategies that could revolutionize discount retailing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But it seems clear from the design and innovations built
into the prototype that Wal-Mart thinks its customers of the
future will be as concerned about service as about low
prices. Upon entering the store, customers expecting the
usual warehouse ambiance of discount stores will be shocked.
With wide aisles and classy displays, it looks more like an
upscale department store than a spartan discounter. And one
of the biggest distinctions between discount and department
stores -- self-service vs. full service -- is blurred at this
store; new technology provides information about products and
helps customers locate them, though there appear to be a few
bugs in the system. The new store even has some designer
names typically found only at upscale department stores, such
as Estee Lauder and Calvin Klein.
   Unlike department stores, however, the Wal-Mart store has
the same bargain-basement prices found in all its outlets.
   "It's an outstanding store," says David Poneman, a
retailing analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., adding that
it only heightens "the long-term trend of the discount store
nipping away at the edge of the department-store franchise."
   Though upscale department stores aren't exactly
preoccupied with goings-on in Rogers (population 24,000),
they aren't dismissing Wal-Mart's experimental prototype as
inconsequential -- especially since the company plans to
expand aggressively into big-city markets with stores of one
kind or another.
   Trying out unproven devices such as shopping carts with
video screens may seem odd for a retailer dedicated to low
costs. But it's in keeping with a corporate tradition of
disdain for the conventional -- which extends back to when
Mr. Walton, against the advice of virtually everyone, began
opening discount stores in towns thought too small to support
them.
   Indeed, says Mr. Poneman, the corporate culture at
Wal-Mart still encourages ideas that might seem downright
"wacky," he says, "and a few might work."
   Wal-Mart, long a leader in computerizing the distribution
side of retailing, is putting technology in the hands of
customers at this store. Consumerscan, found throughout the
store, gives customers their own bar-code scanners to check
prices. Though prices are marked on shelves, customers
sometimes "forget the price once they put it in their cart,"
says a Wal-Mart associate stationed near a Consumerscan.
   The Wal-Mart Arts Report has a TV screen to let customers
preview movies and music videos. Shoppers also can use the
device to order titles that aren't in stock. A few feet away
is Wal-Mart Sound Associates, which provides information
about audio products.
   The Arts Report and Sound Associates could represent
breakthroughs, analysts say. "Self-service stores have always
been hard for customers to find information in, and Wal-Mart
is becoming a leader in providing improved consumer
information through technology," says Sid Doolittle, a
Chicago retail consultant and former Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.
executive.
   The most popular gadget in the store is VideOcart, an
information technology becoming available in supermarkets but
until now not used elsewhere, according to the company that
provides it. As customers progress through the store,
information about the department at hand flashes on the video
screen attached to their carts. A pass through men's apparel,
for instance, elicits news of a sale on Fruit-of-the-Loom
T-shirts. "I love it," says Kim Woodfin, who says she changed
her mind about a plastic swimming pool after VideOcart
directed her to a less expensive model.
   VideOcart also helps customers find their way. It lists
hundreds of product categories by department, along with a
department-by-department map of the store. "I've used that to
find a lot of stuff," says Sherree Oyler, shopping with her
two children.
   Wal-Mart officials won't comment on their experience with
VideOcart. But VideOcart Inc., the Chicago company that sells
it, says the carts have increased sales by $1 a visit at
supermarkets. VideOcart predicts that its technology will
prompt discount-store shoppers -- who typically use carts
less often than grocery customers -- to increase their use of
carts, possibly resulting in greater sales.
   It's far from certain that the prototype store here will
become the Wal-Mart of the future. At about 125,000 square
feet, it is the largest Wal-Mart store (50% bigger than
most), and much of that space is devoted to wider aisles,
less cramped displays and sitting areas for customers --
features that could increase expenses and squeeze profit
margins.
   Moreover, technology isn't necessarily a satisfactory
substitute for knowledgeable sales clerks. When customer Jean
Moore, trying to find Super Glue, checked her VideOcart, it
directed her to the stationery department, where most
household glues are located. But Super Glue, for heavy-duty
uses, is in hardware.
   And on a recent day, a customer trying to use Wal-Mart
Sound Associates, the audio products guide, found its screen
blank and dark -- because, hours after the store had opened,
no one had plugged it in.
   Finally, it isn't clear how many designer-name products
Wal-Mart will be able to offer at other stores. In fact, it
isn't even clear how they managed to offer Estee Lauder and
Calvin Klein fragrances here in Arkansas. Officials of those
companies say they don't and won't sell their product to
discounters such as Wal-Mart. "We don't know where they got"
the fragrances being sold in Rogers, says a Calvin Klein
spokeswoman, because "we only sell to upscale department
stores and specialty stores."
   Wal-Mart officials decline to comment.
   Despite the uncertainty, the new Wal-Mart store gets good
reviews. Customers like the more spacious design. "In the
store that this one replaced, two carts could barely pass in
the aisle without crashing," Ms. Oyler says.
   And retail specialists praise the displays, which organize
related products -- such as shower curtains, towels and
ceramic bathroom accessories -- into visual "vignettes." "The
displays are as good as an upscale department store," says
Betty Martin Musham, a New York apparel designer touring the
store after a recent visit to Wal-Mart's nearby headquarters.
She predicts that the cost of added display space will be
more than recouped through sales of "multiples," or related
products.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ordered its
outlets in 26 states Monday to restock Listerine pulled from
shelves over the weekend after a woman said the mouthwash burned
her mouth.
   Officials at Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville began
notifying managers of the chain's 1,279 stores to return thousands
of bottles of the mouthwash to shelves after extensive testing by
manufacturer Warner-Lambert Co.
   Warner-Lambert rushed the unused portion of the suspect bottle
through analysis Sunday night at its New Jersey laboratory, and
conducted more tests early Monday. The tests found only normal
product ingredients.
   The mouthwash was removed from Wal-Mart shelves Saturday.
   ``We believed from the beginning this was an isolated incident.
However, we chose not to take any chances,'' said Don Fields,
Wal-Mart's executive vice president for merchandising. ``The safety
and well-being of our customers come first.''
   Listerine was expected to be back on the shelves of all Wal-Mart
stores by Monday night, said company spokesman Don Shinkle.
   Wal-Mart officials have not determined how much removing the
mouthwash had cost the company, Shinkle said. He said no one was
second-guessing the decision to do so.
   ``We stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do,''
Shinkle said. ``Our customers would more than agree with that.''
   The woman, whom company officials have declined to identify,
complained Saturday that her mouth was red and irritated after
using Listerine she bought at a Wal-Mart Store in Rogers, Ark. She
sought treatment from a dentist and ``is fine,'' Shinkle said.
   Barry S. Cohen, a spokesman for Warner-Lambert in Morris Plains,
N.J., said no other problems had been reported with Listerine,
which is made at a plant in Lititz, Pa.
   ``It's a 125-year-old product. It's shipped around the country.
If there's some problem with the product we would have received
other calls, but we haven't,'' Cohen said.
   No ingredient in Listerine would cause burns, even when mixed in
excessive amounts, Cohen said. The mouthwash is marketed as an
antiseptic, however, and can cause an astringent, tingly sensation.
   Wal-Mart has stores in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Walton Opens Visitor Center Displaying Wal-Mart History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sporting his traditional Wal-Mart cap
and a red, white and blue employee badge bearing the name ``Sam,''
the founder of the Wal-Mart discount chain on Wednesday reopened
the 5&amp;10 store that started it all.
   Sam Walton held court from a flatbed trailer stage in a steady
drizzle to formally open the Wal-Mart Visitor Center in the same
building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for
business on May 9, 1950.
   ``I bird-hunt in the rain,'' Walton said when offered an
umbrella. ``I don't need that thing.''
   Aided by displays and audio-video presentations, the center
chronicles the rise of the fast-growing chain, now the nation's
second-largest discount retailer after K mart Corp., from its
beginnings as a small rural shop. The first Wal-Mart Discount City
opened in 1962.
   The window displays date back to the store's opening, with
Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some
Ivory Snow. Inside, an electronic map details the company's current
1,500-plus store chain.
   Also on display is the hula skirt Sam Walton donned for his
``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after the company met
his challenge to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
   The ceremony, which attracted about 400 people and included a
keynote address by Gov. Bill Clinton, lasted less than 45 minutes
after Walton admonished master of ceremonies Don Soderquist,
Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, to hurry things up.
   ``We've always been lucky about rain _ it hardly ever rains at
any other function we've every planned, but today of all days ...
How can you trim this thing down?'' Walton asked.
   Most of the speakers were Walton family members or Wal-Mart
associates who concentrated on the company's history.
   Sam Walton said Wal-Mart's growth was beyond anything he
expected when he opened his five-and-dime.
   ``What 40 years have brought us, we never could have dreamed,''
he said, noting that he purchased the five-and-dime for $16,000
when it was doing $32,000 annually in sales. ``Helen and I were out
of debt _ we'd made a little money in Newport (the site of his
first retail store), and we were out of debt for about six months''
when the expansions that grew into Wal-Mart began.
   He told of taking his wife and four children on scouting trips
to potential store sites, when ``the kids would start chanting,
``Dad, no more store looking.''
   The expansion could never have occurred, he said, if his
Bentonville store had not been profitable.

   Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart
discount chain, has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment
for a malignant bone marrow disease, Walton said in a memo
distributed Wednesday to Wal-Mart employees.
   In the two-page memo, Walton, 71, said he had been undergoing
treatment at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston for multiple
myeloma, which he described as a bone disease. Myeloma is a
malignant tumor of the bone marrow, consisting generally of
abnormal plasma cells.
   Since Sunday, Walton said, he had undergone two chemotherapy
treatments and radiation treatment. Don Shinkle, a Wal-Mart Stores
spokesman, said Walton wrote in the memo that he feels much better
after experiencing aches and pains the past several months.
   Shortly after noon Wednesday, Walton visited one of the
company's stores, a Sam's Wholesale Club, in Houston, Shinkle said.
   According to Shinkle, Walton said in the memo that he may be
slowed down for a few weeks, but that he expects to resume visiting
other stores in a few weeks.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the company said in a statement released by Shinkle
from corporate headquarters here.
   Walton's memo outlined Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, said the employees were responsible for those
accomplishments and that he looked forward to more success.
   Shinkle declined to provide a copy of the memo, saying it was
personal.

WAL-MART PLANS ITS FIRST STORES IN CALIFORNIA;
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE FIRM'S STRATEGY IS UNLIKE ITS MOVES INTO SMALL TOWNS IN THE
MIDWEST AND SOUTH. IT IS NOW POISED TO MOVE INTO MARKETS NEAR BIG CITIES.

<P>
Wal-Mart, the Bentonville, Ark.-based discounter with more than 1,400 stores
nationwide, is now poised to invade California.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to open 10 stores in California in 1990 and 1991, with most
to be located in the interior sections of the state. This year, it will open
stores in Lancaster, Victorville, El Centro, Madera, Modesto, Ridgecrest and
Stockton. In 1991, it plans stores in Elk Grove, Hanford and Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
But, unlike its moves into small, isolated towns in the Midwest and South,
Wal-Mart's entry into California is really part of a new corporate strategy
that is seeing the company start to invade larger markets on the edges of major
metropolitan areas. In these larger communities, Wal-Mart is likely to have a
much smaller economic impact than it has had in the rural Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
"They will be ringing the big cities, in the outer suburbs," said Woody Whyte,
a retail analyst with the Stephens Inc. brokerage in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
Its stores in Lancaster and Victorville, for instance, will place Wal-Mart for
the first time on the outer edges of the Southern California metropolitan
market; Elk Grove, Modesto and Stockton will put the chain just beyond the Bay
Area-Sacramento metro markets.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, analysts say, the chain is moving into the outer reaches of big
cities in other sections of the nation, like the Chicago and Atlanta
metropolitan areas, and is entering some markets on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
"Originally we were in rural towns, but we feel we can fill the needs of
customers in large towns as well," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jane Arend said.
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart's decision to move beyond its small-town roots is part of founder Sam
M. Walton's strategy to grow dramatically during the coming decade. At the
company's annual meeting earlier this month, Walton said he hopes that
Wal-Mart, which now has annual sales of about $26 billion, can hit sales of
$125 billion a year by the end of the decade. That would make it one of the
nation's biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Wal-Mart is fully capable of reaching those heights.
Already, it is on the verge of surpassing Sears to become the nation's largest
retailer.
</P>
<P>
"Sam Walton doesn't promise things if he doesn't think they are do-able," Whyte
said. "In my opinion, Wal-Mart is one of the best-run companies in America."

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Few better qualified -
What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth / Sam
Walton's American dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance
and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages
Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream;
few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.
Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy
who became one of the world's most successful businessmen. The church-going
son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store
chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his
death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.
His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after
Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children
held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.
What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth. Although
Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from
1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount
store.
At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with
sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount
Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers. Ten years
later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest
retailer in the US. Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears
Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest. Within
another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.
Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death,
however, published material about the company is curiously scarce. This book
attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of
Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining
how it was achieved.
One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt
from other retailers.
Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realised the threat
discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth
many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and
Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.
Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores
into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling
long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling
everything they needed.
Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology. As early as the
1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a
small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to
do to the end of his life.
Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be
persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs -
long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest
Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system. This technology
helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any
retailer. But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book
suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management
structure.
Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville,
Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every
Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working
with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting
every Friday.
They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am
meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to
relate the results. District managers hold a conference call with their
store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have
been communicated to all store department heads.
The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week
and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation
begin the following week.
Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however. One was
Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role
in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976
after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins. Another was
Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for
gigantist America.
Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street if
Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984. It did, and
he did.
The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the
economies of small US towns was positive or negative.
If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite
captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing
retailer. Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can
continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it
conquered the US.
But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in
building his own American dream.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart's Quarterly Profit Climbs 29 Percent; Limited's Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The large discount chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Tuesday said
its third-quarter profit climbed 29 percent, boosted by strong
sales growth.
   Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. posted a 21 percent gain
in its third-quarter income on a 10 percent increase in sales.
   Wal-Mart, the country's third largest retailer, announced its
after-tax earnings rose to $232.7 million, or 41 cents a share, in
the three months ended Oct. 31 from $180.9 million, or 32 cents a
share, in 1988's third quarter.
   Sales at the stores Wal-Mart operates in 27 states totaled $6.28
billion in the third quarter, up from $4.99 billion a year earlier.
   At the end of the quarter, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer
had 1,347 Wal-Mart stores, 118 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot
Discount Drug stores and three Hypermart USA units. Wal-Mart ranks
third in terms of sales after industry leader Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and No.2 K mart Corp.
   David Glass, president and chief executive officer, said
Wal-Mart's third-quarter performance reflects attention to customer
service, disciplined inventory management and merchandising
programs.
   ``We expect the fourth quarter to be highly competitive but
believe our inventory levels, our associates' involvement and
continued efforts at exceeding our customers' expectations will
enable us to meet our goals and objectives,'' Glass said in a news
release.
   For the first nine months of Wal-Mart's financial year, income
rose 26 percent to $650.04 million, or $1.15 a share, from $514.04
million, or 91 cents a share, through three quarters of 1988.
   Nine-month sales amounted to $17.7 billion, up 25 percent from
$14.12 billion during the comparable portion of 1988.
   Separately, Limited said its net income rose to $84.9 million,
or 47 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 28 frm $70.4
million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $1.11
billion from $1.01 billion.
   Leslie H. Waxner, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Limited pursued a cautious strategy during the autumn, keeping
inventories below last year's level, on a square foot basis.
   ``My view was that the general economy was softening and lacked
strong consumer demand,'' Waxner said. ``I believe our third
quarter earnings are a reflection of that conservative inventory
position.''
   He said business in the third quarter ``was focused
conservatively on the quality of sales and profitability.''
   Waxner expressed a more upbeat attitude toward the fourth
quarter, which is a crucial time for retailers.
   ``The current success of our merchandising effort and the
acceptance of our fashion direction gives us more optimism as we
enter the fourth quarter,'' Waxner said.
   Retailers pick up about a third of their annual revenues and a
half or more of their yearly profits in the two-month peak holiday
shopping season.
   For the first nine months of this year, Limited's earnings rose
55 percent to $193.8 million, or $1.07 a share, from $124.99
million, or 69 cents a share, the prior year. Nine-month sales rose
13 percent to $3.07 billion from $2.71 billion.
   Limited is one of the country's leading specialty apparel chains
with 3,120 stores. Stores owned by the Columbus, Ohio-based company
include The Limited, Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret,
Lerner, Lane Bryant and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it was laying off as many as
1,200 workers in what a spokesman called a "normal adjustment
to market conditions."
   The cuts are being made in Sam's Clubs, the company's
highly successful, discount warehouse retailing operation.
About 25 jobs were cut at Sam's headquarters, with the
remaining layoffs spread out among the division's 192
outlets, the spokesman said.

   The spokesman said the cuts weren't a response to the weak
economy, but an attempt to match costs with revenue in a
division built on discount pricing. He pointed out that since
Jan. 1, Wal-Mart, a Bentonville, Ark., retailer, has added
24,000 jobs corporatewide through new store openings,
bringing total employment to 367,000.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart Stores announces 21.5
per cent second-quarter profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in terms of sales, yesterday
unveiled a 21.5 per cent increase in second-quarter profits after tax, to
Dollars 420.4m. The advance came on the back of a 26 per cent sales rise, to
Dollars 13bn, writes Nikki Tait.
The second-quarter results take Wal-Mart's profits for the first six months,
to end-July, to Dollars 807.4m, up from Dollars 652.8m a year earlier. Sales
increased from Dollars 19.6bn to Dollars 24.7bn.
Earnings per share were up from 30 cents to 37 cents in the second quarter,
and from 57 cents to 70 cents in the first half. The group's shares rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/2 on the news.
Part of the advance comes from Wal-Mart's highly aggressive expansion
programme. In the second quarter alone, the discount retailer opened 20 new
Wal-Mart stores and 18 Sam's Clubs - wholesale clubs which sell at
rock-bottom prices to a membership customer base.
By the end of July, the company was operating 1,755 Wal-Mart stores and 233
Sam's Clubs. It covers 44 states, having recently added Idaho.

Wal-Mart, One of Few Trees Left Standing,
Is Buffeted by Fears of Slower Sales Growth

<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores is one of the tallest trees left standing since the market hurricane toppled many others like Limited and Gap, which had been growing to the sky.

   Limited and Gap have fallen 65% and 75% from their 1987 peaks, and both sell at discounts to the price-earnings ratio of 14 times estimated 1987 earnings for the 500 stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's index.

   Wal-Mart, down only 42%, still sells at a fat premium of 23 times earnings, as a result of its track record for growth and its status as a heartland discounter of blue-collar goods.
This is the opposite of a Tiffany or Neiman-Marcus whose sales to yuppies might take a hit after the stock market crash.

   But Wal-Mart was shaken to its roots last week after officials of the Bentonville, Ark.-based discount retailer told analysts that one key measure of sales growth was falling short of expectations in November.
As analyst Martha Kimball of Wertheim Schroder relayed the news, sales for stores over a year old, which Wal-Mart had expected to increase 8% to 9%, may actually grow only 4% to 6%.

   This shocked some investors who are watching for any hint of how bad the crash will hurt consumer spending.
"Retailers are normally under a magnifying glass.
This time they're under a microscope," says Francis Rienhoff, who follows retail stocks for T. Rowe Price.

   Wal-Mart stock fell 1 1/4 to 25 3/4 Tuesday on volume of 1.4 million shares.
It was the second-most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, as 2.5 million shares traded at lower levels and Wal-Mart slipped another 3/8.
On Friday, Wal-Mart fell 3/8 more to close at 25.

   "This is a stock that people are ready to pull the trigger on if they see that there's any problem," observed Mark Cunneen, who follows retailers at Massachusetts Financial Services, a Boston mutual fund complex.

   Some analysts have already fired.
"We've been advising our clients to reduce holdings in the stock due to priciness," says Robert Buchanan of L.F. Rothschild.
"The retail group has been creamed since the end of August amid doubts about consumer spending.
And here sits Wal-Mart, the third-largest retailer, which hasn't been hit as much as the group."

   Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel Burnham Lambert said the November sales pattern represents a "fairly sharp slowing" from Wal-Mart's 12% year-to-date comparable-store sales growth.
He has rated the stock as "neutral" out of concern for high-multiple issues in an economic slowdown.

   Tuesday's stock-price fall was probably steeper because some Wal-Mart phone lines were down that afternoon, and nervous shareholders seeking confirmation and elaboration of the analysts' calls couldn't get through.

   But on Wednesday, some friendlier analysts at Goldman Sachs and Smith Barney went to bat for the company, and officials insisted there was no cause for alarm, considering Wal-Mart's 10-year record of 39% annual sales growth and 40% profit gains.

   "A few of the new analysts who follow us said single-digit increases for Wal-Mart are a terrible, tragic change.
But our profitability is as good as it's ever been," said Jack Shewmaker, vice chairman of the retailer.
"To take a two or three-week period and extrapolate that into some kind of reversal for Wal-Mart is irresponsible."

   Mr. Shewmaker said Wal-Mart's November promotional circulars were mailed out a week later this year than in 1986, leading to "a disparity in sales earlier in the month" that Wal-Mart has already begun to make up.
He added that cold weather has come late to Wal-Mart's southeastern U.S. stronghold, hurting sales of wintertime items.

   Despite the "economic uncertainty" and the postponement of some Christmas purchases, Mr. Shewmaker said, last week's sales re-accelerated to show "strong double-digit" comparable-store sales growth.
In October, Wal-Mart's growth dwarfed other retailers', with a 40% sales increase and same-store sales up 14%.

   Many analysts believe the real test didn't begin until Thanksgiving, start of prime holiday selling.
"I just don't understand how (the early November results) could be meaningful," said Marion Schultheis of IDS Financial Services.
Ms. Kimball of Wertheim notes the company still believes it can achieve 8% to 9% same-store sales growth for the quarter ending January 1988.

   Beyond the shaky economy, Wal-Mart still faces questions about its long-term growth prospects at current annual revenues of $16 billion or so.
After all, founder and Chairman Sam Walton is already twice as rich as anyone else in the U.S.

   But as First Boston analyst Margaret Gilliam noted in a "strong buy" recommendation Nov. 12, when the stock was at 28 1/2, Wal-Mart still has only a 1% share of all U.S. retail sales and operates in only 24 states.
She said its "potential to increase its share of personal-consumption expenditures is enormous."

<HEAD>Wealthy Wal-Mart Founder Just Another Neighbor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER M. FULFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's ranked as the richest man in the
nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville,
a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
   ``He's just a part of the community,'' said Curt Loyd, executive
director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce. ``He's a neat
person. He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us.''
   Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart
stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again
shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the
world's top billionaires. According to Forbes magazine's July 24
edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up
from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   ``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the
silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,
based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
   Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday
morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers. Shinkle said
news coverage about Walton ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for
comments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman declined to
comment.
   ``He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and
he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,''
Shinkle said.
   ``He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings. It just
puts him in a position he doesn't want to be.''
   But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal
modesty. Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's
family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he
quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another
topic that it was only paper. Walton then changed the subject.
   Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in
October 1985. Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's
wealthiest people. Walton made that listing as the richest American
every year since. This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese
businessmen.
   Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than
1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single
five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago. He is out of the
office up to four days a week, the spokesman said.
   ``He spends most of his time talking to associates and
customers,'' Shinkle said, ``and he always comes back with many
ideas from them.''
   Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.
   When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans,
recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in
from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.
   ``They wanted to know about the stock and the company,'' said
Simpson, who works for Stephens Inc. ``You'd think that he'd be
living in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now people
just accept it.
   ``When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'''
Simpson said.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart To Pare Imported Products From Inventories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has launched a
program aimed at reducing the amount of imported products in the
inventory of its discount store chain.
   Company officials will prepare a list of imports ``and all those
items with be fair game'' if the company opts to go with United
States manufacturers, according to Joe Chappelle, director of
Wal-Mart's newly-created USA Division.
   Chappelle said the Bentonville-based company, the nation's
third-largest general retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K
mart Corp., would ask for help from state industrial development
organizations in enlisting domestic manufacturers for the program.
   He said the company would provide the agencies with a list of
imported products sold at its stores, specifications on the
products and other information that will help them put Wal-Mart and
interested manufacturers in touch with each other.
   Chappelle said Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton was ``deeply
committed to the Buy America program,'' and that the company was
willing to take the risk of product specifications falling onto the
hands of competitors.
   The company has no idea how many imported products will be
replaced by domestic ones, and products will be studied on a
case-by case basis. No time frame was given for the program.
   Conversion of some labor-intensive products may be a problem
because of the difference in wages paid in the United States and
some foreign countries, Chappelle said.
   ``I'm not saying that it's impossible to convert labor-intensive
items because it may be that you would wind up getting more
value,'' he said.
   Chappelle also said small manufacturers should not shy away from
the program because of Wal-Mart's giant volume requirements.
   ``The volume can be shocking, but if a manufacturer only wants
to bid on a certain quantity, he can do that. He can get any part
of the pie he wants,'' he said.
   Wal-Mart stockholders are to discuss the program at a meeting
next month. A preview was given Friday in Stuttgart for
participants in the LeadAR program, an agricultural and rural
leadership development program sponsored by the University of
Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bentonville, Ark., said its net
income increased 13% for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan.
31 to $481.8 million, or 42 cents a share, from $425.9
million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Despite the increase, the discounter's results
disappointed the market. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Wal-Mart's stock dropped $1.25 to close at
$35.375.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was a tough quarter," said Robert Buchanan, analyst at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. Mr. Buchanan said that Wal-Mart's
expenses were up for the period, at least in part because it
opened 72 Wal-Mart stores during the quarter, out of 176 for
the year. The company opened just 56 stores in the
year-earlier period.
   Sales for the quarter rose 28% to $10.36 billion from
$8.11 billion last year.
   For the year, Wal-Mart said it had net income of $1.29
billion, or $1.14 a share, up 20% from $1.08 billion, or 95
cents a share, last year. Sales were $32.6 billion, up 26%
from $25.81 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Despite the lower than hoped for quarterly results, Mr.
Buchanan said he still is expecting a strong year ahead as
Wal-Mart takes advantage of its low prices to attract
shoppers in a recession. He said he is predicting the company
will earn $1.40 a share in fiscal 1992.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart beats trend with 24%
profits rise

<TEXT>
WAL-MART Stores, the Arkansas-based discount stores chain which is now the
world's largest retailer in sales terms, yesterday disclosed a 34.6 per cent
jump in turnover last year to Dollars 43.9bn and a 24.6 per cent increase in
net profits to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 1.29bn.
At the earnings per share level, Wal-Mart reported a 22.8 per cent
improvement, to Dollars 1.40.
Wal-Mart's figures contrast sharply with those delivered by many US
retailers - in particular, the traditional department stores - who have been
badly affected by the grim economic climate and the general slump in
consumer spending.
Growth during the fourth quarter was roughly in line with that for the year.
Sales in the three months to end-January totalled Dollars 13.6bn, up from
Dollars 10.4bn in the same period a year earlier.
Net profits rose 25 per cent to Dollars 602.4m and earnings per share rose
to 52 cents from 42 cents.
In part, Wal-Mart's sales growth stems from a ferocious store expansion
programme. In the fourth quarter, for example, it opened 68 new Wal-Mart
stores, which sell low-priced general merchandise, and 15 Sam's Clubs.
Sam's Clubs are warehouse club operations, sited in out-of-town 'barns' and
selling a limited range of goods at deeply-discounted prices to a membership
customer base. Wal-Mart is the biggest operator in this fast-growing market
niche.
However, for much of last year, the group also posted double-digit
'same-store' sales growth.
The results for 1991-2 were scored after interest charges of Dollars 113.3m,
more than double the Dollars 42.7m in 1990-91. The increase in total costs
and expenses also slightly exceeded sales growth - rising by 35.4 per cent
to Dollars 41.7bn.
The results were much as analysts had expected, however, and shares in
Wal-Mart - which has grown from one 'five and dime' store 40 years ago to
overtake Kmart and Sears Roebuck as the nation's largest retailer - rose
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8.

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it is
expanding outside the continental U.S., opening three
Wal-Mart stores and one Sam's Club in Puerto Rico.
   The company, which has changed the face of rural America
with its discount stores, said it will begin building stores
this spring in Arecibo, Fajardo and Mayaguez. It also will
build a Sam's warehouse store, aimed at small businesses, in
Caguas.

FT  03 MAR 92 / All the ingredients for a long shelf life: Can Wal-Mart,
America's discount retail group, sustain its explosive growth?
</HEADLINE>

At 8.30 on a cold winter's morning in Dover, Delaware, employees of a new
114,000 sq ft Wal-Mart store are whooping and hollering. 'Give me a W,'
shouts a store manager, leading the pre-opening ceremony. 'W,' yells the
throng of shop assistants. 'Give me an A,' . . . and so on.
Outside, the locals press against the glass and debate what effect the
arrival of America's most successful discount retailer will have on their
town. 'Tough on Ames,' mutters one lady, referring to a rival general
merchandise retailer which has already filed for bankruptcy. Sure enough,
100 yards down the road, Ames has sparsely stocked shelves and only four
customers.
Already an aggressive store expansion programme has taken Wal-Mart's sales
from Dollars 2.44bn in 1982 to almost Dollars 44bn last year - making it the
world's largest retailer in turnover terms. Last week it reported a 24.6 per
cent increase in profits in 1991 over 1990 to Dollars 1.6bn. Now Wal-Mart,
which sells goods from detergents to golf clubs, is muscling into food
retailing and experimenting with own-label. It is also engaging in a row
with trade representatives, and offering suppliers a direct computer link to
individual stores to cut lead supply times.
In so doing, the group is starting to lay down rules for the retail sector
in a way that no US chain has done before. 'Wal-Mart is the biggest single
influence in US retailing,' says Ms Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with
Oppenheimer, the US financial services group.
Perhaps not just in the US. Retailing does not cross national boundaries
easily, but ideas do get swapped. The international spread of discount (or
'value') shopping, for example, is evident in the arrival of Germany's Aldi
group and the Danish Netto chain in the UK.
Wal-Mart's position today is all the more impressive when put in
perspective. In 1950, Mr Sam Walton, a former trainee with the J C Penney
retail group, lost the lease on a Ben Franklin-franchised variety store in
Newport, Arkansas. After complex negotiating, he secured a new property in
the tiny northern Arkansas town of Bentonville. Here, he opened the first
Walton's 5 &amp; 10, a small general goods store.
Forty years later, Bentonville is still the headquarters for more than 1,700
Wal-Mart stores, about 208 Sam's Warehouse Clubs and four hypermarkets.
These are served by 20 distribution centres, employ 365,000 people, and
capital expenditure runs at more than Dollars 2bn a year. Mr Walton, now 73,
and his four children ranked third last year in Fortune's list of the 500
richest Americans.
For years, observers have tried to define the ingredients of this success.
Their answers usually mention Wal-Mart's traditional small-town base - where
land costs are low, and shrinkage (or 'lost' stocks) and other operational
problems are more manageable.
Then there is the meticulous attention to cost, and the fact that prices
are, indeed, kept very low. (In Dover, a quart of bleach costs 89 cents in
Wal-Mart and Dollars 1.14 at Ames.) This is partly because Wal-Mart's staff
is non-unionised, and 40 per cent work part-time, saving the company
insurance and holiday expenses, while executives occupy shoe box offices.
Success is also attributed to the company's willingness to innovate or, at
least, to poach successful ideas. Warehouse clubs are a good example. These
barns, which sell a limited range of goods at wholesale prices to
'membership' customers, were developed by a Californian retailer in the
mid-1970s. Wal-Mart latched on to the notion within a decade - well before
competitors like K mart, which subsequently bought the PACE club chain.
Not all schemes work so well. Wal-Mart borrowed the hypermarket concept from
Europe, and built four - all at least 220,000 square feet. Now it says they
are too large to manage efficiently, and will not add more.
But whatever the key to Wal-Mart's past success, the question is whether the
group can sustain its explosive growth, as competition grows from the likes
of Dayton Hudson's Target chain and K mart.
The first expansion route is geographical. Wal-Mart is concentrated in the
south and mid-west, only recently tackling the north-east and west and
taking tentative steps into Mexico. 'There's so much opportunity out there,'
says Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive. 'We have gone from Dollars
32.6bn in sales in 1990-91 to almost Dollars 44bn last year, and I can
envisage us layering on Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn this year.'
One potential problem with this strategy is that it may raise costs. 'If
they want to go after the New York, Los Angeles or Chicago markets, it's a
different ball-game,' says Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz, a Wal-Mart
supplier. 'Real estate becomes expensive and there are all sorts of union
problems.' Used to hearing such concerns, Mr Glass shakes his head, pointing
out that Wal-Mart already has stores around Houston, Dallas, and even in
Chicago's suburbs.
As well as new sites, however, Wal-Mart's long-term plans depend on new
product areas - notably food retailing. Sam's Clubs have already taken the
Wal-Mart group into bulk food items in a big way. But now the company is
experimenting with 'supercentres', which combine supermarket facilities with
general merchandise. It plans to double the number to about 20 this year.
Manufacturers, meanwhile, may have shuddered at Wal-Mart's experiments in
selling colas, cookies and snacks under the Sam's Choice name. In general,
US shoppers view own-label products as cheap but inferior - giving brand
manufacturers considerable clout. But Sam Walton is a household name, and
Sam's Choice may convey more sense of quality.
Wal-Mart itself is ambivalent about the potential. '(The targeted own-label
segments) are generally difficult products to merchandise,' says Mr Glass.
'You buy soft drinks regionally, you buy them at all kinds of prices. Other
categories are simply those where there has been a big increase in brand
prices, and you're getting consumer resistance.'
So is Wal-Mart saying that when suppliers fail to meet its requirements, it
will crack the whip by introducing competing own-label products? 'Oh no;'
Wal-Mart's chief executive looks pained. 'We wouldn't do that - we believe
we are partners with our suppliers.'
But underlying such expansion tactics is a more fundamental question. How
far can any retailer grow before operations become unmanageable and
standards slip?
It is a conundrum to which no one has an answer. Wal-Mart has surpassed K
mart and Sears Roebuck, which seemed to stall when their merchandise sales
reached some Dollars 30bn during the 1980s. Asked about estimates that
Wal-Mart could see annual sales of Dollars 100bn this century, Mr Glass says
this is 'do-able'. 'But that's a pretty ambitious plan,' he adds quickly,
'because no retailer has ever done Dollars 100bn before, and I'm not sure
that any of us know what you'd have to do to be able to achieve it.'
Retail analysts suggest that part of the answer may lie in technology, and
Wal-Mart seems to agree. It makes much of the 'retail link' scheme, which
plugs suppliers into point-of-sale data in individual stores. Although only
a fifth of its 5,000 vendors have been persuaded to invest so far, overall
average lead times are said to have fallen from double figures a year ago,
to nine days.
The retailer also suggests that increased efficiency is the reason for a
recent move to eliminate manufacturers' representatives, the traditional
middlemen, from negotiations with suppliers. 'If you have a manufacturer and
you do Dollars 50m with him one year, and say you'll probably do Dollars
100m next . . . many of them have trouble relating to that,' says Mr Glass.
'Where you have a third party involved it becomes particularly difficult.'
The representatives, for their part, protest that they are essential to
small manufacturers, and have tried to take the matter to the Federal Trade
Commission, the US competition watchdog. They also hint that Wal-Mart's real
aim is better terms from manufacturers.
Whatever the merits of the argument, most observers suspect that the
discount chain will win - at least, where larger suppliers are concerned.
Already, Procter &amp; Gamble, probably Wal-Mart's largest supplier, is reported
to have a team living in Bentonville.
And if anyone doubts the seriousness of Wal-Mart's ambitions, they should
visit its computer room. 'I don't think many people know this exists,'
confesses one employee, opening the door on a room the size of a football
pitch. Bentonville may just have seen the future.

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- In what amounts to a major triumph
for a Texas hot dog vendor and her elderly, handicapped work
force, a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unit that had come under fire
for ordering the vendor off its properties said it has
reversed its position and will allow the vendor to stay.
   After Wal-Mart's Sam's Wholesale Clubs unit ordered
Scarlett Rabalais's Hot Diggity Dogs company to remove its
stands from in front of 21 Sam's stores in Texas, the local
press covered the eviction's implications for Ms. Rabalais's
largely elderly and handicapped work force. Eager to stop the
bad publicity, Sam's officials invited Ms. Rabalais to
Bentonville last week to discuss the problem.

<TEXT>
   Following that meeting, Sam's said that it agreed to let
Hot Diggity Dogs not only stay at its existing sites, but
also expand to three others.

   For Wal-Mart Stores Inc., it's one down
and one to go.
   The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer slipped past Kmart in
November to become America's No. 2 retailer, according to sales
figures released this week. Now, industry analysts say that early
next year Wal-Mart will overtake Sears, Roebuck and Co. as the
nation's top retailer.
   Even Sears is conceding defeat.
   ``In terms of dollar signs, they will surpass us. There's no
doubt about it,'' Gordon Jones, a Sears spokesman, said Friday.
   The figures showed Chicago-based Sears with $27.48 billion in
sales for the first 10 months of 1990. Wal-Mart sales for the same
period were $25.46 billion. But Wal-Mart's growth rate was 25
percent, while Sears grew at just 2.1 percent.
   Kmart's sales for the first 10 months of the year totaled $25.2
billion.
   Analysts say Wal-Mart's strong growth rate will allow the
discount retailer to bump Sears for the No. 1 spot.
   Wal-Mart probably will fall $500 million or $1 billion short of
Sears by Jan. 31, the close of Wal-Mart's fiscal year, said Stacy
Dutton, an analyst with Morgan Stanley and Co. in New York.
   ``But then next year, it's all Wal-Mart,'' Ms. Dutton predicted.
   Sears will have about $32.5 billion in revenues from domestic
and foreign merchandising and credit for this current fiscal year,
she said. Wal-Mart will total about $31.5 billion to $32 billion
this fiscal year, she said.
   ``It will be real close, but clearly next year, Wal-Mart will
surpass Sears, especially with the acquisitions they've made,''
said Craig Weichmann, an analyst with Morgan Keegan and Co. in
Memphis.
   Last month Wal-Mart announced it planned to buy The Wholesale
Club Inc. In October it said it would acquire McLane Co. Inc., the
country's sixth-largest grocery distributor.
   Wal-Mart officially passed Kmart as the No. 2 retailer in the
country in November, with $25.46 billion in sales for 10 months
compared with Kmart's $25.2 billion.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bentonville, Ark., said it signed a
letter of intent to acquire Western Merchandisers Inc.,
Amarillo, Texas, in exchange for $28 million of Wal-Mart
common stock.
   Under terms of the transaction, Western Merchandisers will
spin off its retail book, music and video businesses
currently handled by a host of companies, including Hastings
Books &amp; Records, into a company named Hastings Books &amp;
Records Inc. The spinoff will leave the rack jobbing, OneStop
and warehouse operations as Western Merchandisers' sole
operations. Wal-Mart said Western Merchandisers will
eventually become a unit.

   The companies said shareholders will be given the option

ultimately exchanging them for Wal-Mart common stock, for
Hastings, or for a combination of the two.

<TEXT>
   For more than 40 years, Fannie and Leo Berkenbile have run little pharmacies around here, wooing customers with neighborly concern, generous credit and round-the-clock emergency service.

   But their business has changed since a Wal-Mart Discount City brought its cut-rate prices to Pawhuska's edge four years ago.
Sales have slid.
Cash purchases have dwindled.
And long-time customers have turned nasty.

   "People come in and say we're robbing them" because the prices are higher than Wal-Mart's, Mrs. Berkenbile says.
She and her husband would like to sell the store and retire, she says, but "frankly, at the rate this is going, this store won't be here in another year."

   Some of this may sound old hat to big-city merchants, who saw their customers scatter to shiny new malls in the suburbs decades ago.
But familiar scenes sometimes play themselves out differently in small towns, where merchant-customer relations are more personal.

   Such is the case here in small-town Oklahoma.
Angry consumers, such as those confronting the Berkenbiles, are only one sign.
Angry shopkeepers are another.
Five small-town Oklahoma druggists, including the Berkenbiles, are suing Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of Bentonville, Ark., charging that it is violating an obscure 1941 state law that requires retailers to sell their goods above cost.
That has apparently angered Wal-Mart, which is spending thousands of dollars to get the law repealed - so far unsuccessfully.
"We just don't feel the law serves any viable purpose," says Jim von Gremp, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs.

   Few Oklahomans would want Wal-Mart, the nation's fourth largest retailer, to disappear.
Its 77 Oklahoma stores employ about 9,500 people and offer much wider selections than local stores.
But in a region already battered by the problems of the energy and agriculture industries, Wal-Mart's aggressive pricing can be devastating to local merchants.

   Last year, a whole block of downtown stores here closed.
The five-and-dime is gone, and so is the J.C. Penney.
The population, already down to about 4,200, is still slipping.
"Wal-Mart didn't cause the trouble," says Bonnie Peters of Peters Hardware, "but they haven't helped any."

   Wal-Mart doesn't gain from such a downturn, either, of course.
Healthy local merchants bring more rural shoppers to town and to its stores.
But such a big corporation can't help affecting the commercial fabric of small towns.
In places like Ringling, Elk City and Pawhuska, local merchants buy ads in the high-school yearbook and support the Future Farmers' pig sales.
Shops offer personal charge accounts and repair broken items.
Drugstores still deliver.

   One recent Sunday night, Pawhuska pharmacist Alan E. Irby quit fixing a faucet in his house to open his store for an old customer.
While he filled the man's prescription, he says, "we talked about his wife Pansy and the Shriners and the Blue and Gold Cub Scout Banquet."
He adds, "You know, there's a certain amount of charm about living in a small town."

   But the charm fades fast when customers start comparing local prices with the prices at the Wal-Mart down the highway.
With more than 1,000 stores, WalMart is able to buy large quantities of items at a discount and then sell them for less.
The strategy has made Sam M. Walton, Wal-Mart's founder and chairman, a billionaire, but it hurts retailers like Harry's Super Foods in Ringling, where a box of 32 large diapers sells for a dollar more than at Wal-Mart.

   "It makes you look like you're profiteering," says owner Harry Goodman.

   At the Pawhuska Wal-Mart, maintenance drugs like insulin, blood-pressure medicine and ulcer remedies are priced as much as $10 below the prices at local stores, and initially Wal-Mart advertised its lower prices heavily.
"Some of my better customers were coming in here and waving the ad in my face," says John E. Snider, a druggist in Hominy, south of Pawhuska.
"It hurt me professionally.
It hurt my image."

   Mr. Snider was angry enough to hire a lawyer in Tulsa and round up four other pharmacists to join him in the suit against Wal-Mart.
They say the discounter is breaking a little-known state law that requires a merchant to sell products at least 6 3/4% above cost, unless the store is having a sale or matching a competitor's price.

   After more than two years of legal wrangling, a Tulsa federal judge recently ruled that Oklahoma's law was constitutional and set a trial for late this year.

   Meanwhile, Wal-Mart turned to the state legislature, hiring four of Oklahoma's top lobbyists and spending an estimated $80,000 to try to get the law repealed.
Through a trade group, Wal-Mart and other big retailers placed ads in newspapers statewide, urging readers to "stop higher consumer prices" by writing to their state representatives.
It also armed greeters, who welcome customers to Wal-Mart stores, with petitions calling for lower prices.
They gathered more than 200,000 names in eight days.

   But claiming that the law causes higher prices is "the worst case of misrepresentation in the history of Oklahoma," charges state Rep. Rick Littlefield of Grove, who lobbied against repeal.
The law, he and others say, protects small operators from big corporations that lower prices, drive competitors out of business and then, when no competitors are left, raise their prices again.

   "If the bill {to repeal} had passed, it would have resulted in businesses putting plywood over the doors and windows up and down Main Street, Okla.," Mr. Littlefield insists.

   In Wal-Mart's case, the law takes aim at "loss leaders," under which the retailer advertises a few popular goods, like disposable diapers or sugar, at prices near cost to attract customers.
While the ads may imply that all the store's prices are low, other items are priced higher to compensate for the loss leaders. (In fact, Wal-Mart's average markup is about 30%, small even for a discount store.)

   At a hearing in February, Wal-Mart argued that it might have to prepare special ads just for Oklahoma if the law remained in force.
And it noted that any company wanting to eliminate competition could merely set prices at 7% above cost.
But the state's House Economic Development Committee rejected the so-called Wal-Mart bill by a 21-7 vote.

   Back in Pawhuska, the local Wal-Mart has also come under fire from the Pawhuska Daily Journal-Capital.
Last November the newspaper called the store "a billion-dollar parasite" and a "national retail ogre" for its miserly community contributions.
Dave Story, then the newspaper's general manager, says he wrote the editorial after a chamber of commerce banquet drew more than 100 business people but no one from Wal-Mart.
Recently, merchants and town leaders say, the Wal-Mart store has contributed to a downtown revitalization effort and become more active in town affairs.

   At the Wal-Mart itself, shoppers are more interested in prices and choices than the town economy.
Loren and Tonnie Pahsetopah say that they would drive miles to a Wal-Mart for the variety it offers.
Jimmy Cheves holds out a pair of canvas work gloves that are on sale for $1.75.
"You'd pay $4 for these at the grocery store," he says.
"I think you can get better buys out here."

   The downtown merchants know that all too well.
The Western Auto store is being converted into a used furniture and antiques outlet.
Peters Hardware has dropped Corning dishes and Oneida silverware because it can't match Wal-Mart's prices; it promotes gift items and a bridal registry instead.
"Wal-Mart really craters a little town's downtown," says Fred M. Wright, who closed his TV and record store last October.

   But across the street, Sally Carroll presides over a grill where cheeseburgers still cost $1.20.
Though buildings around her are empty, she doesn't blame Wal-Mart, which she says is the last place in town where she can buy fabrics and affordable work clothes.
Without it, she says, "we'd be lost -- we wouldn't have a dang store."
