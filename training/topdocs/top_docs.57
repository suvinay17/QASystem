FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investors sought for Zimbabwe
diamond mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River
Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates
the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern
border of Zimbabwe. De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to
concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the
heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South
Africa. After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production
as Venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines.
The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991
after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about
marketing the diamonds. The government insists that all minerals are sold
through its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.
Mr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new
joint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site
before leaving.
Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from
the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines.
(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site
before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River
Ranch had been bulldozed.)
Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De
Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. He helped
Auridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was
once chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up
for tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.
The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m
tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in March
last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of
gem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.
Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds
780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp;
Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to
330,000 carats.
The increase will be reached in two phases. The first, costing USDollars
2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second will
cost Dollars 8.7m. The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy and
move a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZ
Corporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
The joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of
ground around the mine and Mr Baxter-Brown suggested the chances of finding
another diamond deposit were good.
While most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a
carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6
carats. A 28-carat stone was sold for Dollars 110,000 or Dollars 4,000 a
carat, and one of 17 carats for Dollars 95,000 (Dollars 6,000 a carat).
Diamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and not
through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per
cent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade. But as Mr Baxter-Brown
pointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: High hopes for Lake Michigan
diamonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AREA west of Lake Michigan in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the
US has a good chance of yielding a world-class diamond mine, said Mr John
Robinson, chief executive of Ashton Mining, yesterday.
Ashton is based in Australia but sees diamond mining as its core business
and will go anywhere in the world to search for the stones. So the company
grabbed with both hands an opportunity to buy 51 per cent of the Great Lakes
diamond project from Dow Chemical, he said. The deal was completed in
January.
Of the 14 kimberlite pipes found by the previous joint venturers in the
project - Dow and Crystal Exploration - 12 had been tested an nine contained
diamonds. 'This means the probability of success is much higher than usual,'
said Mr Robinson.
To put this in context, of the 3,000 known kimberlite deposits in the world,
only 1,000 contain diamonds and only 50 to 60 have ever proved economic.
Ashton draws most of its cash flow and profit from a 38.2 per cent share of
the Argyle mine in Western Australia, in weight terms the world's biggest
diamond producer.
Mr Robinson, in London with Ashton's chairman Sir Leslie Froggatt to talk to
institutional investors, said that in Ashton's view only one of the 12
kimberlite pipes discovered by the Great Lakes venturers had been fully
tested. So priority was being given to drilling the three untested and eight
partly-tested pipes with a view to identifying the various phases of
kimberlite present and testing the diamond content.
Ashton had also used its special skills to re-examine exploration data from
its joint venture in Australia's Northern Territory where it has a 65.4 per
cent interest and where exploration has been going on for 14 years. Mr
Robinson said the results were very exciting. 'The whole perception of the
deposit has changed,' he said. The company had now identified 11 large
diamondiferous targets.
One loam sample collected recently from pipes located about 140 km (85
miles) north of the town of Coanjula contained a broken, commercial-sized
diamond measuring 3mm by 2.7mm by 1.4mm.
Ashton also has gold mining interests and of the ADollars 12m it will spend
on exploration this year, most will go to look for the yellow metal. Mr
Robinson suggested that De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which
controls 80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond trade and markets
most of Argyle's gem diamonds, would not put up prices this year. The latest
rough diamond price rise (of 5.5 per cent) was as long ago as March 1990.
But the CSO would probably make an increase early next year, he said.

Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia,
De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with
Botswana and Zimbabwe.
Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of
USDollars 400m, De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80
per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its
producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola. For a time
Venetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for
seven-day working, moved to a five-day week.
This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so
that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to
take from producers. However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market,
caused by uncertainty about Russian exports following 'leaks' of stones from
that country outside its contract with the CSO.
Consequently, Mr Hans Gastrow, general manager, says that this year Venetia
will process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity. It is also
mining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne.
Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be
well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at
full production.
Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and
processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. About 70 per cent of
Venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars
100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars
500m.
Mr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia
'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'.
This year will be a time of consolidation.
He insists that the quota is having no impact on employment. Nevertheless,
Venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764. A mine of
Venetia's size in the past would have employed 2,000. The total has been
kept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewer
people employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs',
according to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.
Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years. It is
also the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export
earnings.
The mine has also revitalised De Beers' production, as it is accounting for
half the group's output in South Africa and replacing production from its
100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.
Venetia's success is strategically important to De Beers because, when its
output is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group direct
control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. This
provides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerful
position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.
And, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes
of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected
23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour
relations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa is
concerned.
For example, there are no migrant workers at the mine. Employees are bussed
in from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.
Venetia is also breaking with the De Beers' tradition that, for security
reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security
area once it is no longer useful. Here worn out equipment will be stockpiled
and sold off when the mine closes. It could be worth millions of dollars.

THE HANDFUL of companies with diamond mining expertise have been deluged
with inquiries and proposals in the past year following the excitement
generated by discoveries in Canada's North West Territories.
Ashton Mining, the Australian company with a 40.1 per cent stake in the
Argyle diamond mine, the western world's biggest producer in volume terms,
has had more than a dozen offers to analyse, says Mr John Robinson, chief
executive. 'The renewed interest in diamond exploration has flushed out many
opportunities and we have been putting them through a stringent screening
process.'
Mr Robinson, insists that, if all the exploration activity produces a new
diamond mine, it would not destabilise the market. He points out that world
diamond output fell by 3 per cent in value to USDollars 6bn last year and
'production in Russia is falling, Zaire's output is down 25 per cent and in
1993 there has been only a trickle of diamonds from Angola'.
Ashton has settled on three projects in Canada: the Lupin joint venture in
the Northwest Territories where Ashton has the right to buy 51 per cent of a
project covering 6,300 square km (2,400 square miles) in the Slave Lake
province from Pure Gold Resources; some 15,500 sq km in the Peace River
district of Alberta, where Ashton is earning 51 per cent, again from Pure
Gold Resources; and the James Bay venture in Ontario where Ashton can earn
51 per cent from KWG Resources.
Mr Robinson says that all this activity has forced Ashton into an abrupt
switch of emphasis away from gold, in which it was getting more involved,
and towards diamonds. Consequently, the company is to reduce its 90 per cent
shareholding in the Mt Muro gold project in Indonesia which requires about
ADollars 110m to bring into production.
Outside Canada, Ashton is putting together a formal licence application
after signing an agreement in principle for a diamond joint venture with the
government in Karelia, western Russia. The area of the licence covers about
two thirds of the republic.
Ashton has 51 per cent of another diamond project in the Great Lakes area of
Michigan, US, but Mr Robinson says the most prospective area in the
portfolio  - because it is the most advanced  - is in the Northern Territory
of Australia where the company has a 67.7 per cent interest. Samples from
the Merlin prospect in the area last year produced 20 commercial size
diamonds, one in four of them of gem quality and the largest of 2.44 carats.
The Argyle mine's output this year is forecast to be close to the record 39m
carats produced last year, says Mr Robinson, who is in London to talk to
institutional investors.

THE BIGGEST rush to stake mining claims in the history of the North American
industry is going on at Lac de Gras in Canada's Northwest Territories.
Causing all the excitement are 81 small diamonds, each less than 2 mm in
diameter but some of gem quality, found in a kimberlite pipe about 300 km
(185 miles) north-east of the city of Yellowknife.
At least 22,800 sq km (8,900 square miles) has been staked around the first
discovery and hundreds of claims are still outstanding.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large - more
than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in most cases. A device fitted to the
helicopter gives a constant reading of longitude and latitude and when a
pre-determined site is found the helicopter lands, allowing a crew member to
jump out and hammer in a claim post.
The Northern Miner, Canada's mining newspaper, reports, however, that so
great is the rush that many of the posts are being dropped from above and
will be secured only after the spring thaw.
The claim rush, said by some observers even to outdo the Yukon gold days at
the end of the 19th century, is being caused by a peculiarity of geology.
Kimberlite pipes usually occur in clusters of ten to 40 spread over an area
of 100 sq km or more. So there is every chance that the main diamond bonanza
could be well outside the area where the first stones were found.
The diamonds were in a 140 m (465 ft) length of core drilled by a joint
venture owned by BHP, Australia's biggest corporation, and a Canadian junior
exploration company called Dia Met Minerals.
Significantly, among those to have rushed to the area is Monopros, the
Canadian exploration arm of De Beers, the South African group which controls
80 per cent of the world's trade in rough (uncut) diamonds.
The Northern Miner reports that the joint venturers have transported 200
tonnes of material from Lac de Gras for testing. Ten trucks carried the
material along the 580 km winter road, built when the ice is thick enough,
between Echo Bay's Lupin gold mine and Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest
Territories. This road runs half a mile from the diamond discovery.
Sampling is being carried out at Dia Met's 80 tonnes a day diamond recovery
plant near Fort Collins in Colorado. The company estimates that, after some
fine tuning, recovery rates will be about 99 per cent.
Analysts suggest that to be economic the kimberlite pipe, estimated to have
a surface area of 16 to 32 hectares, would need a grade of 0.5 to 0.9 carats
a tonne (1 carat equals 200 milligrams) with diamond quality of Dollars 50 a
carat. Sampling will indicate the ratio of industrial to gem quality
diamonds. Industrial diamonds, which also can be made synthetically, fetch
only about Dollars 1.3 a carat.
BHP has decided to double its annual spending on the Lac de Gras property to
CDollars 2m (Pounds 960,000). To earn a 51 per cent interest, the Australian
group has also agreed to finance a feasibility study and arrange production
financing of up to CDollars 500m. Mr Vincent Pisani, analyst at Potter
Warburg, the Sydney stockbroker, points out in the latest SG Warburg
International Mining Outlook, that the Lac de Gras venture is not the only
one providing diamond exploration excitement in North America. In
Saskatchewan, four or five companies are working in the Prince Albert area.
At Fort-La-Corne, Cameco and Uranerz Mining report that 160 microdiamonds
have been recovered from 15 separate kimberlite pipes. But, at an average of
2 carats a tonne, the grade is uneconomic. There is also exploration in
Northern Alberta and Ontario in the Attwapiskat River area.
Ashton Mining, the Australian group that owns 40 per cent of the world's
biggest diamond mine (in weight terms) at Argyle in the Kimberley district
of Western Australia, is committing 30 per cent of its USDollars 5m diamond
exploration budget over the next three years to the Great Lakes project
located south of Lake Superior and west of Lake Michigan in the states of
Michigan and Wisconsin.
Exploration there revealed a cluster of kimberlitic pipes bearing
microdiamonds and these are being tested for commercial potential. Ashton is
earning a 51 per cent interest in the project from a junior company called
Crystal Mining. Early work was carried out by Dow Chemical and it also
retains an interest.
Ashton believes that Great Lakes has the potential to be a world-class
diamond deposit.
However, Northern Miner adds some words of caution. It points out that there
have been several diamond finds in the US but only one, the Crater of
Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, ever reached production.
This is not surprising because, in order for diamonds to remain intact and
not become graphite or carbon dioxide, they must be brought to the surface
from depths of 160 km or more at speeds of 8 to 32 kph as the
kimberlite/lamproite magma reaches the surface.
Consequently, although there are more than 3,000 known kimberlite deposits
in the world, fewer than 1,000 carry any diamonds and only 50 to 60 have
ever proved economic.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers digs deeper into its
resources - The new lease of life for the Jwaneng and Finsch diamond mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana, is
known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the
richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the
stones it yields. Jwaneng's position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m
expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of
schedule and under budget.
Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South
Africa, another diamond mine, the Finsch, where operations started in 1964,
has been given a new lease of life.
Having dug an open pit 423 metres deep, miners have now gone underground. Mr
Simon Webb, the general manager, says that the underground development has
given it another 35 to 40 years of life.
All this goes to show that De Beers, the South African group that dominates
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its
ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term
difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with Russia. It also
remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its
100-year-old mines at Kimberley are now running down.
The South African group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of
world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate
with the other producers who have marketing contracts with De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation,
In Botswana De Beers controls half of Debswana, the company that owns the
Jwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest. The value of Jwaneng to
Botswana cannot be overstated.
It, and the country's two other (smaller) diamond mines, between them
account for 50 per cent of the government's revenue and 40 per cent of the
country's gross domestic product. No wonder Jwaneng's company slogan is Re
phtas imisa Botswana, which translates as 'We make Botswana sparkle'.
Production started at Jwaneng in 1982. Now a so-called fourth stream is
being completed which is adding one-third to processing capacity. In turn,
this means a 21 per cent rise in the number of carats produced. Last year
the mine treated 5.8m tonnes of ore which yielded 8.546m carats of diamonds,
well below the 1992 output when the 5.77m tonnes treated gave up more than
9m carats.
Jwaneng's open pit has reached a depth of 190 metres. Already it is 2kms
long and 1km wide. Mr Loz Shaw, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600
metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit
will go down at least that far.
Mr Derrick Moore, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the
open pit will last another 35 years - 'and then we might go underground'.
If experience at De Beers' wholly-owned Finsch mine in South Africa is
anything to go by, planning the underground development at Jwaneng might
already have started.
Planning for the underground mine at Finsch started in the 1970s and the
first work began in 1979. Yet the bottom of the Finsch open pit - 423 metres
 -was not reached until 1990.
Unfortunately, things did not go completely as expected when underground
mining started, to some extent because the development was designed by a
management whose expertise was mainly in open pit mining.
However, Mr Mark Button, mining superintendent, says: 'Finsch has come of
age as an underground mine after two years. Our costs compare with the best
in the group.'
Among the innovations that have helped Finsch achieve its objectives are
some remote-controlled LHD (load-haul-dump) trucks which are similar to
radio-controlled toy vehicles or boats. Using VHF radio signals, a driver
can stand back and send a truck on its own to dig out material from areas
between the old pit wall and the underground development that would not
otherwise be mined because of the dangers involved. When, as occasionally
happens, rock crashes on to the LHD trucks, it is relatively simply to haul
the vehicles out virtually undamaged.
Mr Webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, at
which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make
recovery viable.
Finsch - named after the discoverers, Messrs Fincham and Schwabel, who
stumbled across the kimberlite pipe containing the diamonds when actually
they were looking for asbestos - is one of the victims of the present
turmoil in the diamond market caused mainly by uncertainties about Russian
exports.
About 500 of its 1,900 employees were laid off in August 1992. It is mining
only five days a week at present and processing on four days. Last year
Finsch mined 2.68m tonnes and recovered 2m carats of diamonds compared with
4.7m tonnes mined and 3.446m carats in 1992.
Mr Webb suggests 1994 output will be similar to last year's. But when market
conditions improve, production can be brought back up to previous levels in
about six months.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac de Gras diamond project
forecast to have global impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAC de Gras area in Canada's Northwest Territories will be developed
into a diamond producer rivalling Botswana, the world's biggest producer of
gem diamonds in value terms, according to the Credit Lyonnais Laing
financial services group.
The area - or camp - as a whole might have the potential to add 20 per cent
to total world rough (uncut) diamonds production and one third to world gem
diamonds output, says analyst Mr Roger Chaplin in a special study of the Lac
de Gras phenomenon, which has seen 40,000 square km (16,000 square miles)
staked in the biggest rush for land seen in North America.
Mr Chaplin suggests that the first diamond-containing kimberlite pipe
drilled in the area - called the Point Lake pipe - is 'giving world-class
results and we estimate a value of approximately USDollars 2bn for this pipe
alone.
'There are many more pipes to be found, some of which are likely to exceed
the Point Lake pipe in size and grade,' he adds.
The study estimates that the Point Lake pipe may have reserves of more than
105m carats of diamonds and says a conservative estimate of production would
be about 3.5m carats a year, possibly expanding to 7m carats in time. 'These
reserves would have a gross in-situ value of about USDollars 9bn and could
generate revenues of at least Dollars 300m a year, growing to about Dollars
600m.'
Mr Chaplin points out: 'This is equivalent to a gold mine producing 800,000
to 1.7m ounces of gold a year - but far more profitable. To put the size of
the potential mine into perspective in the diamond industry, there are only
five diamond mines in the world which produce at more than 3m carats a year
and between them these major operations account for about 75 per cent of gem
diamonds production.'
He suggests that, although the share price of Dia Met Minerals, the Canadian
company that discovered Point Lake and is now backed by Broken Hill
Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, has risen by 2,000
per cent in the past year, if CLL assessment of the discovery is correct, it
is still undervalued.
Some other analysts are not so enthusiastic. Mr Rob Weinberg at the Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull financial services group points out that Dia Met's
share price puts a value of Dollars 290m on its exploration properties,
which is equivalent to 36 per cent of Australia's Argyle mine. 'We can't
help feeling that that is somewhat excessive.' Argyle is producing about
33.6m carats of diamonds a year, of which about 1.7m are gem diamonds.
Others point out that, although there are more than 3,000 known kimberlite
deposits in the world, only 1,000 contain diamonds and only between 50 and
60 have ever proved economic.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Search for glittering prizes beneath the Canadian ice:
Digging for diamonds in the frozen Northwest Territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody who works outdoors at this time of year in Canada's Northwest
Territories must have a very good reason. Temperatures plummet as low as
 400C, and feel even lower when fierce winds whip across the snow-covered
Arctic tundra. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable
to snap when weight is put on it. Trucks and machinery must be kept running
around the clock to prevent their engines freezing.
A group of drillers and geologists employed by BHP, the Australian steel and
mining group, are braving these conditions on a frozen lake 310km north-east
of Yellowknife. Shielded from the wind by tarpaulins, they are working
12-hour shifts, day and night, around two 15-metre high drilling rigs. The
men have five days of emergency rations in case blizzards cut them off from
their base camp 4km away.
By the time the ice starts melting in late April, the drills will have
extracted 400 tonnes or more of kimberlite rock from beneath the lake, and
at least one other site nearby. BHP and its partners are confident that the
samples will contain enough high-quality gems to move towards construction
of North America's first diamond mine.
Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP Minerals' exploration manager in North America, says he
will be disappointed if a mine does not materialise. 'We're minimising our
chances of failure,' he says. BHP, which would have a 51 per cent stake in
the project, plans to spend at least CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.68m) on the
drilling programme this year.
Mr John Lydall, mining analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, said
if a mine was built, it could supply about 7 per cent of the world's diamond
market.
The hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories has turned into one of
the biggest stampedes in North American mining history. Besides BHP, a
cluster of companies ranging from heavyweights such as De Beers and
Kennecott, to junior exploration outfits such as Kalahari Resources, have
staked claims covering 103,600sq km, an area about the size of Portugal. One
timber supplier in Yellowknife said it has sold 210,000 wooden stakes in the
past 12 months to mining companies, compared with 25,000 in a normal year.
The staking frenzy is reflected in the share prices of some of the players:
Dia Met Minerals, BHP's Canadian partner, now has a market value of almost
CDollars 450m, with its share price zooming up from less than a dollar in
late 1991 to CDollars 43 now. Two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit
Lyonnais, are in the process of buying CDollars 13m worth of Dia Met stock.
The story of diamond fever in the frozen north goes back to the early 1980s
when Mr Dummett, who then worked for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush
pilot that De Beers was prospecting along the Mackenzie River. Under cover
of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian geologist and Dia
Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers camp and picked up
some samples.
Over the next few years, the search moved eastward towards the source of the
vast ice sheet which millions of years ago scraped up - and then deposited -
metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada.
The BHP-Dia Met joint venture, which was formed in 1990, made a breakthrough
in late 1991 in the Lac de Gras area, 350km east of the Mackenzie River.
Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of
diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the
grade normally required to justify a mine.
The purpose of this winter's drilling programme is to extract bigger samples
from other kimberlite pipes on BHP's 875,000 acre claim. The frozen samples
are transported by truck to a Dia Met processing laboratory in Colorado. The
results will be made known later this year.
BHP wants to have a sample of at least 2,000 carats before it decides
whether to press ahead with construction of a mine.
The partners are already confident that the quantity of diamonds in the Lac
de Gras kimberlite pipes is sufficient to support a mine milling around
10,000 tonnes of ore a day. Their optimism is based largely on the results
of research by Professor John Gurney, a geo-chemist at the University of
Cape Town.
Prof Gurney's theory, which appears to be supported by almost every diamond
discovery around the world, is that a kimberlite pipe is virtually certain
to contain diamonds if the purple-grey garnets in the pipe combine a high
chrome content with less than 4 per cent calcium. According to the BHP team,
the calcium content of the garnets found around Lac de Gras is 0.7 per cent
or lower.
What still remains to be established however, is the quality of the Lac de
Gras diamonds. According to Mr Fipke, 'we can predict diamond grades. But no
one can predict the per cent of gem quality.' Roughly one out of 200
kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, but only one in 20 of those has a high
enough proportion of gemstones to justify a mine.
The Northwest Territories diamond rush may yet come to naught. In spite of
the excitement, mining analysts caution that the shares of the companies
involved are for speculators only.
But if all goes well at Lac de Gras, BHP and its partners could have a mine
in operation by 1997 or 1998. They are unconcerned by the recent glut in the
world diamond market.
With many of the alluvial mines on the west coast of southern Africa as well
as the big Argyle property in Australia likely to run out of stones within
the next decade or so, the hope is that any new mines in the Northwest
Territories will come on stream at just the right time.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prospectors go for grand slam
in diamonds - The latest rush is raising doubts about De Beers' cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by
miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is
in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the
world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market.
In Canada's Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, some
of gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the
history of the North American industry.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and
prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of
the discovery.
In spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone will
find enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada's first diamond
mine worthwhile.
The odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond
hunters in Angola. More than Dollars 1m-worth of gem diamonds a day are
being smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
An estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work already and their
numbers are being swelled by 500 a day. This rise of illegal mining,
particularly in the Cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of Angola's
diamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in May, 1991,
after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time
in 16 years.
As well as experienced miners, many soldiers who could not find civilian
jobs have made their way to the diamond areas. The onset of the dry season
and the fall in river levels from the end of May this year has encouraged
what De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond
business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply
of illicit Angolan diamonds reaching the market'.
Even though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being asked
about whether there might be more to this 'explosion.' Did Unita, Angola's
rebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released? Is
Endiama, Angola's state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way? In
the murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound.
De Beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is
remarkable.
What is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angola
or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it for
granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up
and make all their efforts worthwhile.
The cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds. They are
composed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes in
tough material, but there are substitutes for this use. Gem diamonds are
solely for decoration and serve no useful purpose.
But the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen
steadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession
the price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail
market from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.
The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling
Organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.
Apart from De Beers' own production from Namibia and South Africa, the CSO
handles rough gem diamonds from Angola, Australia, Botswana, Russia,
Tanzania and Zaire.
The CSO has been mopping up as many of the smuggled Angolan diamonds as
possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering
severely from soggy demand in the US and Japan, the two biggest markets,
which share about two-thirds of demand between them.
De Beers says that, because times are tough. it will probably have to cut
its annual dividend payment for the first time since 1981. It has also told
the producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contracts
permit at times of stress.
De Beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market
through 'sights' offered by the CSO ten times a year to about 160 selected
buyers. They are offered boxes of diamonds, each worth between Dollars
500,000 and Dollars 25m. The contents are judged by the CSO to balance the
requirements of the buyers with market demand. Buyers have either to accept
all the diamonds or reject the box.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls both De Beers and
its sister group, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, was
defending the cartel again last week at the formal opening of the R1.1bn
Venetia diamond mine in the Transvaal. 'The CSO does not, and could not, run
a monopolistic system,' he said. 'In bad times like this, I sometimes wish
that we could. The fact is that the level of world diamond production, which
is carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled. Diamond prices cannot
be fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows production
and consumption to be equated.
'What the CSO for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer
pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand
is in excess of the level of supply. In this way it has been able to
preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate
luxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and
consumers of this unique natural product.'
All very altruistic. But De Beers makes huge profits from its diamond
business - a record Dollars 1.24bn in 1990 and more than Dollars 1bn last
year.
The cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early 1980s. It was a
time of galloping inflation, a weak dollar and low interest rates.
Merchants, particularly in Israel, stockpiled diamonds on borrowed money as
a hedge against inflation and when recession hit they had to dump diamonds
faster than the Central Selling Organisation could mop them up. The CSO's
diamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by
1984. Hundreds of diamond investment trusts and traders were bankrupted at
that time and Australia and Zaire challenged De Beers' near-monopoly.
De Beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been
built for speculative reasons, frequently going to the banks, the potential
financiers of stockpiling operations, to 'educate' them about the way the
diamond market works.
After the bust came boom. Diamond sales in value terms jumped by 20 per cent
in 1987 and another 37 per cent the following year. To cool the market, the
CSO imposed swingeing price increases: 13.5 per cent in May 1988 and 15.5
per cent in March 1989. Underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demand
for diamonds in Japan where lack of living space encourages people to
display their wealth by buying small but expensive items. The CSO boosted
the trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings are
regularly exchanged in Japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionally
were celebrated over a cup of rice wine.
It must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift the
diamond market as the present recession ends.
But in the meantime Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers' chairman, insists
that the CSO's control of the diamond market is not slipping.
'By mopping up Angolan supplies we can say that more of the world's rough
diamonds are passing through the CSO than ever before,' he says. 'By
applying the deferred purchases clauses in our contracts with producers we
are applying the right medicine to ensure that demand matches supply and
that the diamond market will remain stable'.
The future of De Beers' diamond operations in Namibia were discussed with
the government there yesterday. In the past there have been suggestions that
CDM, De Beers' wholly-owned subsidiary, might be at least partly
nationalised. CDM, has diamond mining operations over a coastal area
extending 100 km north of the Orange River and recently brought the Auchas
and Elizabeth Bay mines into production. Last year Namibian output reached
1.19m carats, up from 750,000.

THE JOINT venturers in Australia's Argyle diamond mine, CRA and Ashton
Mining, are poised to sign a new five-year agreement with South Africa's De
Beers to market the Argyle stones through the Central Selling Organisation.
CRA and Ashton have already signed heads of agreement with the Swiss arm of
the South African group, De Beers Centenary AG.
A joint statement which was issued yesterday by CRA, Ashton and De Beers
said that details were being finalised but that outstanding matters were
expected to be resolved quickly.
The major change to the CSO's marketing of Argyle diamonds since the
Australian group began supplying diamonds to the South Africans eight years
ago is that the entitlement of the third shareholder, the West Australian
Diamond Trust, which had been sold separately, will now go through the CSO.
WADT is 97 per cent owned by CRA and Ashton and has been managed by Ashton
since October, 1989.
CRA owns 56.8 per cent of Argyle, Ashton owns 38.2 per cent and WADT owns
five per cent.
In exchange for selling more of the diamond output through CSO, the Argyle
partners will keep more of the high value gem stone quality, white and
coloured stones, for sale through Argyle Diamond Sales. Argyle Diamond Sales
is a company which is owned proportionately by the joint venturers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner, Dia-Met Minerals, have
moved one step closer to building North America's first diamond mine in the
Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories.
The two companies said that they planned to erect a pilot recovery plant in
the area early next year to analyse a bulk sample of between 5,000 and
10,000 tonnes of ore. Depending on the results, these tests would be
followed by a full feasibility study for a mine. Lac de Gras is just below
the Arctic Circle, about 320 km (200 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the
territories' capital.
The decision to go ahead with such a large sampling programme is based on
the results of drilling last winter which appear to confirm a sizeable
diamond deposit. Analysts at Pacific International Securities in Vancouver
said yesterday that the grade of ore recovered from one of four kimberlite
pipes at Lac de Gras 'puts it into the league of world-class diamond pipes'.
Despite such enthusiasm, Dia-Met's shares tumbled by CDollars 9 to CDollars
57 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. The share price
had tripled in the past year in anticipation of positive results from Lac de
Gras.
According to BHP and Dia-Met, a total of 206 carats were recovered from just
over 400 tonnes of ore extracted from the four pipes. The results include
only stones with a diameter of more than half a millimetre.
The companies said that they had found several gem diamonds in the one to
three carat range.
The proportion of gem diamonds ranged from a low of 6 per cent in pipe
number two to 31 per cent in pipe four and 33 per cent in pipe three.
Pipe four contains a grade of 17.5 gem carats per 100 tonnes. Pacific
International estimates that this is nearly double the grade indicated by a
sample recovered from the nearby Point Lake property in late 1991 which set
off the diamond stampede in the Northwest Territories.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government has announced changes in income tax rules
to encourage diamond exploration. Developers of diamond mines will in future
be entitled to accelerated depreciation of capital costs, while exploration
companies will be able to finance their work by means of 'flow-through'
shares which offer substantial tax benefits to investors.

<TEXT>
   The nation's only public diamond mine
_ which yields about 1,400 gems a year to tourists _ will be opened
to test drilling by four private mining companies in a plan
criticized by environmentalists.
   The exploratory drilling at Crater of Diamonds State Park could
lead to commercial mining at the park, which presently allows
anyone with the $3-a-day price of admission to seek his fortune in
the soft blue-gray soil.
   The state Parks, Recreation and Travel Commission voted 12-0 in
favor of the plan Thursday. If commercially viable deposits are
found, the state could award mining rights to one of the four
companies cooperating in the test drilling.
   The Sierra Club and the Friends of the Crater of Diamonds oppose
the plan, and have threatened legal action to block the exploratory
work. They say businesses don't belong in state parks, and warn the
drilling could open the way to logging or gravel mining in the area.
   The decision to allow exploratory drilling came more than 2{
years after Gov. Bill Clinton's appointed a Diamond Mining Advisory
Task Force to study the prospect of commercial mining at the park
   An advisory team will meet by mid-January, said John Morgan, a
consulting engineer who advised the state. Drilling could begin as
early as April.
   The state got control of the 888-acre park in southwestern
Arkansas in 1972, after a private mining company went bankrupt.
Visitors are allowed to prospect in a 35-acre plowed field, and
it's said people have taken away diamonds as large as 40 carats.
   About 78,000 people try their luck at Crater of Diamonds each
year.
   An independent contractor selected under state bidding
procedures will conduct the tests, working for the state and the
four mining companies.
   The four companies are Kennecott Inc. of Salt Lake City;
Capricorn Diamonds of West Perth, Australia; Continental Diamonds,
which is controlled by a Canadian gold company called Galactic
Resources Ltd., and Arkansas Diamond Development Co., owned by
Texas and Arkansas business people.

output

<DATELINE>
   ACCRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers is installing a new process at Ghana's Akwatia diamond mine which
will soon double its output to 40,000 carats a month as the government
prepares to divest from Ghana Consolidated Diamonds (GCD) next year.
The new process will treat and recover more diamonds, improve their quality,
reduce losses by increasing security and cut the operating costs, according
to Mr J Ansafo-Mensah, GCD's managing director.
De Beers took over interim management of Ghana's only large-scale diamond
mine last October, after Inckel International withdrew from a proposed joint
venture with the government and the US gem marketing company Lazare-Kaplan
in 1992.
Under the new agreement, which has to be approved by Ghana's parliament, GCD
will be restructured by September 1995 as a new company in which De Beers
and Lazare-Kaplan will each own 40 per cent.
The government of Ghana will retain 20 per cent of the assets, and De Beers
Central Selling Organisation will take over the marketing of the diamonds
from Lazare-Kaplan.
When De Beers took over the management last October it increased production
from about 10,000 carats a month to 20,000 carats and from about July output
is expected to reach 40,000 carats a month.
De Beers is reducing the two plants at Akwatia to one and replacing the
bore-milling and pan processes with a dense media separation plant which
will feed a concentrate into an X-ray sorting machine. The equipment is
exclusive to De Beers and is due to begin operating in June on lease to GCD
until the new company is formed.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Funds sought for diamond
projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashton Mining of Australia has two exciting diamond projects that, if all
goes well, might be mined in 1997, according to Mr John Robinson, the chief
executive.
The race is between Ashton's Merlin prospect in the Batten area of
Australia's Northern Territory, where the company has been exploring for 15
years, and its new diamond province in Finland.
Ashton has been exploring in Finland for eight years but kept its operations
there secret until September this year because Finnish laws do not provide
for large and long-life exploration licences. The company is still not
revealing the precise locations of some of the prospective areas in Finland
where it has found 'commercially significant concentrations' of diamonds.
Mr Robinson, speaking to analysts in London this week, said that Ashton was
looking at options for substantial further funding if the projects lived up
to their present promise. The least attractive option would be to bring in a
partner for joint ventures. He preferred the idea of floating projects so as
to bring in public money.
Ashton is Australia's biggest diamond mining company via its 40 per cent
holding in the Argyle mine in Western Australia, the world's largest
producer in volume terms. Argyle's present reserves guarantee its open pit
operations through to 2004 but Mr Robinson said there was a good chance that
moving to underground mining could extend the mine's life considerably.
He was 'very optimistic' about diamond market prospects for the next 10
years. Demand would grow strongly as new markets, such as China, India and
Mexico, developed from a small base. On the supply side, apart from Ashton's
two projects, only the discovery by another Australian group, Broken Hill
Proprietary, in Canada's North West Territories, seemed to offer much
promise. He admitted, however, that there were unanswered questions about
the size of Russia's diamond stockpiles and what it might do with those
gems.

As Other Commodity Cartels Flounder

   Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving. 

   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is floundering, and the international tin cartel has collapsed. 
But De Beers not only halted a fall in rough-diamond prices, it raised them an average 14.5% last year. 
Sales still soared 40% to a near-record $2.56 billion, double the $1.26 billion posted in the 1982 doldrums. 

   De Beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable. 
"Selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers; helping them to sell more is ours," says Stephen Lussier, a De Beers marketing executive. 

   De Beers helped with an advertising and promotion budget that swelled to $110 million this year, up from $43 million in 1980. 
Supplemented by $20 million spent by the diamond trade, the De Beers campaign helped raise world sales of diamond jewelry to 47 million pieces valued at $21.6 billion in 1985, up from 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion in 1979. 
Figures for 1986 aren't yet available, but De Beers says it was another record. 

   The promotional budget covers market research, a world-wide network of as many as 200 public-relations officials, and advertising campaigns coordinated by the agencies N.W. Ayer &amp; Son in the U.S. and J. Walter Thompson Co. in 27 other countries. 

   The master sales plan began in 1938, when former De Beers Chairman Harry Oppenheimer asked Ayer to woo American couples to buy expensive diamond engagement rings. 
Today the U.S. is the world's No. 1 market, with $8 billion in annual retail diamond jewelry sales, or about a 40% share, even though a 1971 antitrust law prevents De Beers from operating directly there. 
About three-fourths of American women own diamond engagement rings that cost an average $1,300. 

   De Beers's strategy is two-pronged, says Mr. Lussier. 
General "diamond image" advertising aims at perpetuating the mystique of quality diamonds as "the ultimate expression of love," he says. 

   De Beers applied similar promotional techniques world-wide. 
One out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings two decades ago. 
Now two-thirds do, and Japan is the second-largest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. 

   De Beers's Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York. 
As the sole middleman, De Beers usually avoids the acrimony that has divided other cartels. 

   The Syndicate has purchase contracts with De Beers's own mines in South Africa and Namibia (a territory controlled by South Africa), other African states such as Botswana, Zaire and Sierra Leone, and Australia. 

   De Beers offers its cache to select dealers 10 times a year at sales known as "sights." 
Each dealer gets a box containing uncut diamonds. 
The dealer must accept or reject the entire box, valued at between $1 million and $25 million. 
If the dealer refuses to buy, De Beers may never invite him back. 

   This ritual has enabled De Beers to maintain price stability. 
The cartel hasn't cut prices since it was founded more than half a century ago. 
Despite grumbling, diamond dealers generally believe that a healthy international diamond market depends on the Syndicate. 

   OPEC members "tend to do what they like," says Jo Flies, chief economist of the Antwerp Diamond Council. 
But De Beers is unique, he says, in influencing production and consumption of diamonds. 
"People mesmerized by the producers' cartels forget that De Beers is an aggressive, ruthless and effective sales organization," says a London dealer. 

   Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers's future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia. 
World diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47 million carats in 1982. 
A carat equals 1/142 of an ounce. 
About 20% of the prize diamonds are produced in southern Africa, but the market is being flooded by cheaper diamonds mainly from Australia and Zaire. 

   The Soviet Union, which produces an estimated 12 million carats of top-grade diamonds annually, is another unknown. 
De Beers has a sales arrangement with the Soviets, but Moscow has dumped diamonds before and may prove difficult to keep in line. 
Angola left the cartel last year, partly because it is involved in a bitter war with South African-backed rebels. 
Other African nations in the cartel want more control over distribution, dealers say. 

   "De Beers can't stop evolution," says Jack Lunzer, chairman of IDC Holdings Ltd., a London-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for Guinea, an African nation that isn't a cartel member. 
While sales independence from De Beers "could be disastrous" for the market, Mr. Lunzer says, that won't deter those producers who want "more information and knowledge about final sales of their material." 

   But the fate of De Beers, South Africa's most famous company, will depend largely on developments in that troubled country, dealers say. 
International sanctions, including a possible U.S. import ban on South African diamonds, pose a growing threat. 

   Recent history indicates, however, that it would be hasty to write off the cartel. 
In 1981, Zaire, which mines 22% of world diamond output, left the cartel. 
Australia was about to open a huge diamond mine and a speculative boom had led to widespread dealer bankruptcies. 
The monopoly was threatened with extinction. 

   While average prices of De Beers's rough diamonds rose 37%, prices of polished diamonds in dealers' stocks collapsed. 
The top-grade investment diamond, D-Flawless, tumbled to around $8,000 a carat in 1985 from an average of $55,000 in 1980. 

   In a series of shrewd moves, De Beers forced Zaire to rejoin the cartel by dumping diamonds. 
Meanwhile, diamond demand by consumers increased, fueled by De Beers's promotion campaign and favorable economic trends. 

   Dealers say trade is buoyant again because of lower interest rates and a weak dollar that makes dollar-priced diamonds cheaper in Japan and Europe. 
Since November 1985, prices of D-Flawless diamonds have risen 56% to around $14,000 a carat. 

   "De Beers is powerful; it is everywhere," says Alfred Lachowsky, chairman of the Antwerp Diamond High Council. 

   The cartel will continue to control world diamond markets, Mr. Lachosky says. 
"You can't mix diamonds with oil."

   Here are answers to commonly asked questions about
diamonds.
   What are diamonds?
   Diamonds are crystallized carbon which has been subjected to
prolonged, steady heat and pressure. They were formed up to 120
miles under the earth's crust billions of years ago.
   Where are diamonds usually found?
   Diamonds were brought to the earth's surface by volcankc
eruptions, so they are found in volcanic rocks known as kimberlite
and lamproite, as well as scattered in river beds, swamps and on
beaches.
   Diamonds are mined in about 20 countries. Australia is the
biggest producer in terms of volume, or 35 million carats in 1988.
In terms of value however, Soviet Union, is considered No. 1,
although the value of its production is a secret.
   How are diamonds mined?
   Diamonds are obtained largely through underground mining or via
a dredging process. Diamond-embedded rocks are squeezed to allow
the diamonds to roll free. Slurry is put in water and the heavier
diamonds sink to the bottom.
   When were diamonds discovered?
   About 2,500 years ago, in India. They were thought to have
special protective powers, worn in arm amulets and placed in sword
hilts.
   Can diamonds be manufactured?
   Yes. General Electric Co. developed a method of synthesizing
diamonds in the 1950s, but experts say natural ones are best.
   How are diamonds graded?
   By carat weight, clarity, color, and cut. A carat is 200
milligrams. There more than 5,000 categories of diamonds, and the
colorless, clear diamonds are the most valued, although blues and
pinks are highly prized.
   In what shapes are diamonds cut?
   The most popular cut is brilliant, a round-shape with 57 facets.
Other classic cuts are pear, oval, marquise, and emerald. New cuts
such as the heart shape have been introduced in recent years.
   How much do diamonds cost?
   Prices vary considerably, but the wholesale price of the highest
grade one-carat gem is about $16,000.
   Does diamond jewelry appreciate in value?
   Sometimes, over a long period of time. But people don't tend to
buy diamonds as a financial investment.
   What is the world's largest diamond?
   The Star of Africa, a 74-facet, 530.2-carat pear gem placed in
Britain's Royal Sceptre. It was found in a mine in Pretoria, South
Africa, cut in 1908 and presented to King Edward VII.
   Why do women wear diamond engagement rings?
   The diamond became a symbol of conjugal fidelity because of its
resistance and endurance. It was introduced into European wedding
ritual in the 15th century.
   Who sang ``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend?''
   Marilyn Monroe, in the title song of the 1949 movie ``Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes.''

FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (17): Shaky, erratic recovery - The diamond
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are critical and exciting times for Angola's diamond industry as it
rides a switchback which has seen production peak at 2.3m carats in 1974 and
slump to 714,000 in 1985.
A somewhat shaky and erratic recovery will be sustained, say officials from
Endiama, the state-owned company, and the government's department of geology
and mining. Mr Jose Dias, the department's secretary of state anticipates
that production will rise to nearly 1.4m carats next year.
The officials believe that foreign investors will respond to improved fiscal
terms and a new mining law, introduced earlier this year, which allows
private companies a greater role in the sector.
The sector's growth in the medium to long term lies in the development of
the country's rich kimberlite potential. Most of Angola's diamonds are
currently mined from alluvial operations in Lunda Norte, chiefly the Cuango
division.
At a development cost of some Dollars 1bn, several kimberlite pipes already
identified in Cuango might yield production of an estimated 3m-4m carats a
year.
The recovery from the mid-80s slump began in 1986 when the state operator,
Diamang - which had a monopoly on official production - was dissolved and
Endiama was established to reorganise the sector.
Endiama, still the sole concessionaire, sought to encourage foreign
investors back into the sector. Following the peace agreement last year, its
policy is beginning to bear fruit.
After a five-year break, Endiama early last year returned Angola's diamonds
to the international fold when it agreed with De Beers Centenary, the
Swiss-based mining and marketing organisation, to sell all its Cuango
production through the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), which purchases,
values and sells nearly 80 per cent of the world's rough diamond production.
The agreement with De Beers also included a Dollars 50m loan to further
develop the production from the Cuango region. The loan has now been fully
drawn down to finance a seven-year contract with Odebrecht, a Brazilian
company, to explore and mine diamond reserves in the Cuango.
The project, brainchild of Mr Noe Baltazer, Endiama's managing director, is
the most ambitious embarked on by the company. It includes the construction
of a high-tech, self-sufficient operational headquarters at the remote site
of Luzamba in the Cuango region.
'The Luzamba project is now the centre of gravity of our operation. Most
importantly, it involves setting up a huge exploration programme in this
area,' says Mr Baltazer.
RST International, a subsidiary of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines,
originally signed an agreement with Endiama to mine diamonds around Cafunfo
at the end of 1986 (a year which had seen organised operations almost grind
to a halt in the Lunda Norte) and remains in operation, its contract renewed
annually.
The alluvial operations in Lunda Norte remain particularly threatened by
illicit digging and selling. Industry officials estimate that illegal sales
of high quality gems could be costing the country as much as Dollars 5m a
week. Diamond exports earned Angola Dollars 190m last year, down from
Dollars 242m in 1990.
Angola, the seventh-largest diamond producer in the world in volume, is
capable of 'making it into the first league', according to an industry
official. However, according to western experts, the explosion in illegal
sales poses a threat to the industry and to Endiama. De Beers, for its part,
has had to buy stones on the open market at market rates in an attempt to
stabilise supply.
A rise in illegal mining, particularly in the Cuango region which produces
80 per cent of Angola's diamonds and some of its highest quality gems,
partly explains the rise in illicit sales. Cuango sites have been flooded by
thousands of diggers since the peace accord last May which allowed freedom
of movement for the first time in 16 years.
Illicit trading was further fuelled, western analysts believe, by a law
introduced at the end of last year, now under review, which gave individuals
the right to own and sell diamonds.
However, these factors do not fully explain the increase. 'We could be
looking at 13,000 carats a week. That would involve a lot of digging,' says
one industry official.
In the murky world of illicit diamond dealing, rumours abound while proof
remains elusive. Popular theories include Unita releasing its stockpiles
following the peace agreement, to Endiama complicity.
These problems will be resolved, officials believe, by a restructuring of
the industry. Legislation introduced at the beginning of this year paves the
way for an end to the state's monopoly of the mining sector. The law
envisages that both foreign and local private companies can invest in
prospecting and mining.
The law covers prospecting and research, exploration and exploitation, and
taxation. Mr Dias says private, mixed or state companies can work alongside
each other, with state enterprises no longer taking precedence.
'We arrived at the conclusion that state enterprises were fully concerned
with administration - and were bad administrators,' he said.
However, the reforms may fall short of investor expectations, for mining
rights have not been made transferable and saleable, and the government
still decides who is competent to operate.
Investor confidence has nevertheless been boosted by the news that De Beers
and Endiama, are due shortly to sign an agreement which both sides say will
set precedents for future deals in the mining sector.
The agreement involves De Beers investing Dollars 50m on evaluation of known
kimberlite deposits and prospecting for new primary deposits in Angola.
The flexible fiscal regime being negotiated as part of the deal is expected
to set precedents which will prove attractive to foreign companies, not just
mining houses.

FT  29 AUG 94 / De Beers sucks jewels off seabed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent, on board the Debmar Atlantic
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventeen nautical miles off the coast of Namibia, armed with techniques
that would not be out of place in a science fiction novel, De Beers is
vacuuming diamonds from the seabed 125 metres below.
The South African group, which dominates the world's diamond business, is
pushing mining technology to the limit, to explore for and recover tens of
thousands of very small precious stones scattered across hundreds of square
kilometres of seabed.
The Debmar Atlantic, a converted oil exploration vessel, has been turned
into a floating diamond mine. It sucks up tonnes of material a minute from
which the diamonds are sorted. Then, for security reasons, the diamonds are
canned on an automated production line, with technology most commonly used
for peaches and pineapple chunks.
Each can is filled with a mixture containing up to 1,900 diamonds.
De Beers Marine, a wholly owned subsidiary of the group, is the only company
operating at these depths. The stones in these Namibian waters are 60m years
old and may have travelled 1,500km, washed down the Orange River by
thunderous downpours in the Transvaal.
To locate the diamonds, De Beers meticulously sampled an area as large as
Holland.
Only the most durable diamonds survived the trip, according to Mr Graham
Rees, DBM's general manager. Nearly every one recovered is of gem quality,
which is what makes the considerable expense of fishing them out of the sea
worthwhile.
DBM has spent about Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to buy and convert its seven
vessels. More than Dollars 50m has been spent exploring since 1991.
The Debmar Atlantic uses a huge drill to get at the stones. A short
helicopter hop away its sister vessel, the Louis G Murray, is using an
under-sea robot crawler, as big as a truck, with hydraulic drills operated
electronically from the ship.
Last year DBM sucked up 302,754 carats of diamonds from the sea bed, 16 per
cent more than in 1992. This year the seabed is likely to yield even more
carats, according to Mr Rees.
It is impossible to say how much the seabed diamonds are worth but DBM's
production last year was about a third of Namibia's diamond output in carats
and more than that in value.

<TEXT>
   De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond
market Wednesday with an exclusive five-year deal to sell the
Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which could total more than $5
billion.
   The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest
gem diamond producers, will get a $1 billion advance against future
diamond sales.
   De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling
Organization, will strengthen its position as the world's dominant
diamond seller. It already markets 80 percent of global rough
diamond production of some 100 million carats.
   The Soviets do not disclose their output.
   The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond
market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African-based company because of its home country's policies of
racial separation, but now is willing to do business openly with De
Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly-held
Swiss company in May to head the non-South African businesses of De
Beers, which is controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne,
Switzerland and made available in London that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the Soviet Union for the
exclusive export and sale of the USSR diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future
diamond deliveries. Repayment would be made over five years
beginning in November.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   ``We have not had an official agreement with the Russians. In
the past, obviously, being major distributors of rough (diamonds),
Russian diamonds have found their way into the rough,'' said De
Beers spokesman Roger Van Eeghen. ``It came through other sources,
other channels.''
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization had sales of
$4.09 billion last year.
   De Beers must renegotiate several key contracts this year, which
experts have said might loosen its grip on the diamond market.
   The formal marketing of the Soviet diamonds, like those from
elsewhere, will take place in London and Lucerne, De Beers said.
   Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers chairman, said the deal would
bring ``continued stability and prosperity of the international
diamond industry.''
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said the Soviet Union, at a time of ``considerable financial
strain,'' was able to raise a $1 billion loan while signing a
contract assuring it of ``a steady flow of funds from diamonds''
over the next five years.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining world startled by
diamond find in Finland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mining industry has been startled by an out-of-the-blue revelation that
Ashton Mining of Australia, has discovered a diamond province in Finland. It
also said that 'the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to be
high.'
While other companies have been scouring Canada's Northwest Territories,
African, Australia and even deep down in the depths of the sea for the gem
stones, Ashton secretly has been prospecting in Finland, a country
best-known for base metals production, for eight years.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive of Ashton, which is one-third owned by the
state-controlled Malaysian Mining Corporation, said his company had found
two fields of kimberlite pipes and a number of isolated kimberlite
occurences - 21 kimberlites in all - and most of them were diamond-bearing.
One pipe of about two hectares in surface area had yielded 26 carats of
diamonds of more than 8mm in size per 100 tonnes from a 23-tonne sample,
with a weighted average of 17 carats per 100 tonnes.
'The results to date confirm that the basic geology in Finland is
prospective for the discovery of an economic diamond deposit and that
Ashton's exploration techniques are effective in glacial terrain,' said Mr
Andrew Button, Ashton's group general manager of exploration and
development.
'New targets in Finland are being generated and testing is continuing in
this exciting location. The exploration areas are close to established
infrastructure and the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to
be high,' he added.
Independent experts agreed. 'This compares favourably with most of the
discoveries in the Northwest Territories, said Mr Roger Ellis, editor of the
Mining Journal.
Ashton is a 40 per cent joint venturer in the Argyle mine in Western
Australia which is the biggest diamond producer in the world in carat (but
not value) terms.
It is not alone in looking for diamonds in Finland. The annual meeting of
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, was enlivened this year by the
presence of two members of the Finnish Sami population (the Laplanders) who
complained that the UK-based group was seeking permission to excavate in
parts of Finland where they had reindeer grazing rights.
Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said this week the group had, indeed,
staked large tracts of land in Finland, mainly because of its potential to
yield diamonds.
Meanwhile, Ashton has accelerated the pace of its activities in Finland and
is building a broader presence in the Nordic/Baltic region, including
Norway, Sweden and Karelia.

A shock has hit hundreds of investors on the Toronto and Vancouver stock
exchanges in the past week. In just two days, more than half a billion
dollars was wiped from the value of exploration companies which have been
involved for three years in a diamond rush over an area almost as big as the
UK in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The sell-off was triggered by an announcement from Kennecott, the US
subsidiary of the UK mining group RTZ, that samples from one much-touted
kimberlite pipe do not contain enough precious stones to justify further
exploration.
The international mining community was caught off guard. Kennecott had
carried out its tests in utmost secrecy at a gold mine near Yellowknife, the
Northwest Territories' rough, boisterous mining centre. It refused even to
share progress reports with its partners in the project. 'We were absolutely
dumbstruck,' says Mr John Hainey, mining analyst at Canaccord Capital, a
Toronto securities firm.
Kennecott's shell-shocked junior partners watched their share prices dive by
as much as 85 per cent. Three of them - Dentonia Resources, Horseshoe Gold
Mining and Kettle River Resources - were worth a combined CDollars 178m
(Pounds 83m) the day before Kennecott dropped its bombshell. Two days later,
their market value had shrivelled to just CDollars 30m. The three companies
have called off a planned merger.
The Great Canadian Diamond Rush thus passes into history as another sobering
reminder of how the merest whiff of riches under the ground can sweep
entrepreneurs, hard-nosed analysts and gullible investors off their feet.
Any geologist will confirm that the chances of finding enough diamonds to
justify more than one mine in a single area are never high. Diamonds are
found in the greyish rock known as kimberlite. But only about one out of
every 200 kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, and no more than one in 20 of
those has enough big stones to justify a mine.
Such long odds did not discourage exploration companies from flocking to the
Northwest Territories, nor analysts from recommending their shares, in the
ambiguous phrase of one recent report, as a 'strong speculative buy'.
Mr Hainey invokes a gambling metaphor. 'The prize is so high,' he says.
'People are prepared to put their money into the lottery.' As with a
lottery, one big winner will probably yet emerge from the Northwest
Territories. A consortium of Australia's BHP Minerals and its Canadian
partner, Dia-Met Minerals, is expected to start construction early next year
on a mine near Lac de Gras, about 300km north-east of Yellowknife. On
present indications, the mine will be one of the world's premier diamond
producers.
The story of BHP and Dia-Met's achievement is perhaps even more impressive
than Kennecott's disaster.
The Northwest Territories presents unusual challenges for men and machines.
The vast expanse of treeless tundra is covered by snow and ice for more than
half the year, with temperatures dropping so low in mid-winter that trucks
and machinery must be kept running around the clock to prevent their engines
freezing. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable to
snap when weight is put on it.
Diamond fever in the Frozen North goes back to the early 1980s. Mr Hugo
Dummett, a geologist working for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush
pilot that De Beers, which controls the world diamond market, was
prospecting near the Mackenzie River.
Under cover of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian
geologist and Dia-Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers
lakeside camp and picked up eight or nine samples of their own.
Superior Oil got out of mining exploration after it was bought by Mobil, the
US energy group. But Mr Fipke continued the search, slowly moving eastward
towards the source of the vast ice sheet which scraped up - and then
deposited - metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada millions of years
ago.
The long search almost broke Dia-Met. Mr Fipke recalled in an interview last
year that several big mining companies which he approached for funds 'turned
us down flat'.
Several fellow-directors at Dia-Met walked out. By 1987, only Mr Fipke's son
and a pilot were left to help him sample the kimberlite outcrops.
In the meantime however, Mr Dummett moved to BHP. He persuaded his new
Australian bosses to form a joint venture with Dia-Met in 1990.
The breakthrough came a year later, about 600km east of the Mackenzie River.
Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of
diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the
grade normally required to justify a mine.
Dia-Met's success set off the prospecting frenzy. Claims covering 53m acres
(81,700 square miles) have been staked in the Lac de Gras area over the past
three years.
Mr Gordon Stewart, whose Yellowknife-based company ferries supplies to
remote mining camps, estimates that business has 'very easily doubled'. His
company has arranged over 2,000 supply flights over the past 12 months.
Subsequent work by BHP and Dia-Met around Lac de Gras unearthed even richer
deposits than Point Lake. The two companies have advanced to a full
feasibility study which should be completed around the end of the year. If
all goes to plan, the BHP-Dia-Met mine will be in production by 1997.
Anyone who shared Mr Fipke's early optimism has made a fortune. Dia-Met
shares, which were trading at around 70 cents in August 1991, soared to a
peak of over CDollars 60 earlier this year, when they were split
two-for-one.
As the company with the best chance of developing a mine, Dia-Met was
relatively unscathed by last week's crash. Its subordinate voting shares
currently change hands at about CDollars 17. From being close to bankruptcy,
Mr Fipke, who appears in Dia-Met's latest annual report wearing his
favourite weather-beaten brown jersey and blue jeans, is now worth CDollars
120m.
Hopes for a second Lac de Gras diamond mine had been pinned on the Kennecott
joint venture. But Kennecott, which came to the NWT relatively late, was
more impatient and less deliberate than BHP. 'They showed up with a blank
cheque book and signed up everybody close to the to Dia-Met claim block,'
recalls a geologist at one rival company.
Kennecott also cut corners in its bid to catch up to the Australians. While
BHP gradually increased the size of its samples, the US company went
straight from a small 2-tonne sample to a costly, underground programme
involving about 5,000 tonnes.
With Kennecott and its partners now licking their wounds, attention has
shifted back to De Beers. The South African group recently signed a
tentative agreement with two junior exploration companies, Tanqueray
Resources and Mill City Gold, which are confident that they have a promising
prospect at Yamba Lake, north-west of Lac de Gras.
De Beers has taken samples from Yamba Lake to its laboratories in South
Africa for further tests. It is due to decide in the next few weeks whether
to press ahead with the joint venture. The question however, is whether
investors who have suffered heavy losses are in any mood to put more money
into the Lac de Gras diamond play. Last week's setback could deprive many
small companies of the capital they need to continue their search.
Mr Stewart, whose Yellowknife supplies business has profited handsomely from
the boom, is among those who has lost heavily on his investments.
Despite the setback however, it probably would not take much to revive the
irrepressible confidence (some would call it greedy recklessness) which is a
hallmark of mining exploration. Another speculative bubble could quickly
appear if De Beers or one of the other companies makes another encouraging
find.
News of the Kennecott debacle was only a few hours old when mining analysts
at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London were advising clients that 'any fall in
the share price of (De Beers' new partners) must be considered a strong
buying opportunity.' By the middle of this week, many of the junior
companies' shares were starting to creep back up again.

<HEADLINE>  GIGANTIC DIAMOND ON DISPLAY IN LONDON  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     De Beers unveiled the heart-shaped jewel in London on Wednesday, with a lot
of security and a touch of drama.;    The room was darkened, then a curtain
opened. A spotlight lighted up an egg-sized diamond, sparkling on a rotating
stand and reflecting colored light around the room.;    "A truly rare and
unique diamond," said Nicky Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of his family's
diamond-mining empire, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.;    The gem is unique
and thus impossible to value, he said, though De Beers has insured it for at
least $100 million.;    There are only two larger diamonds in the world, and
Queen Elizabeth II owns them.;    The largest is the 530.2-carat Great Star of
Africa in the imperial scepter, and the 317.4-carat Lesser Star of Africa in
the imperial crown. They are kept in the Tower of London, and their value is
not known.;    Both were cut 86 years ago from one gem, the Cullinan diamond
that was 3,106 carat rough. Like the Centenary, it was found in De Beers'
Premier mine in South Africa.;    The Cullinan diamond was cut before the
"brilliant" cut was fully developed in the 1920s. This involves cutting facets
to reflect the most possible light.;    The Centenary was found in the
mid-1980s through the normal mechanized mining process in the mine,
Oppenheimer said.;    The rough Centenary diamond, which weighed 599 carats,
was unveiled at the company's centenary celebrations in South Africa in 1988.;
   It then took three years to prepare, cut and polish the jewel, Oppenheimer
said. The Centenary diamond is more than twice the size of the next largest
comparable stone, the company said.;    Gabi Tolkowsky, whose great-uncle
developed the modern cutting methods, cut the Centenary diamond in a cellar in
Johannesburg.;    The Centenary was a difficult stone to cut and polish
because its shape did not suggest an obvious approach for yielding the jewel
locked within, the company said. In its rough form, the diamond resembled an
irregular matchbox.;    "Every day I was looking at it, but at night, it was
looking at me," Tolkowsky joked.;    Finally, he said, it "talked to me and
said, 'This is the shape I want.' ";    De Beers intends to exhibit the
diamond around the world, Oppenheimer said.  </TEXT>

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Survey reveals S Australia's
'staggering' mineral wealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINING COMPANIES are expected to spend ADollars 25m (Pounds 11m) exploring
the state of South Australia in the next 12 months following the revelation
that, according to Mr Ross Fardon, director-general at the department of
mines and energy, some of the most abundant mineral resources are to be
found there under shallow cover.
He says the state has the potential to rank alongside Western Australia,
Chile and South Africa in the mining industry.
This follows a ADollars 16m geological survey - one of the most
comprehensive ever seen in the western world - carried out by the state
government. The survey was needed because two-thirds of South Australia is
covered by soil and sands which hide the mineral-bearing bedrock. However,
advanced aeromagnetic surveys are able to penetrate this cover.
'The results are staggering,' says Mr Fardon. 'We've discovered bedrock
terrains under shallow cover, which are equivalent to those containing the
giant mineral deposits at Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Olympic Dam, all
world-class deposits.'
About 500,000 square kilometres, an area the size of Spain, are being mapped
and tied in with other high-quality data and the details are being made
available at very little cost to exploration companies.
Mr Fardon is at present on a three-week tour of Europe and South Africa to
spread the word. 'We would welcome foreign expertise and money.'
So far about 30 per cent of the survey data has been released and
applications for exploration licences have trebled in the first eight months
of this year.
The early data also sparked a diamond rush after aeromagnetic and
radiometric pictures revealed about 60 geological 'bubbles' which closely
resemble diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes.
'We could be sitting on diamond resources comparable to the world's biggest
diamond mine at Argyle in Western Australia,' says Mr Fardon
enthusiastically.
About 10 companies have started a diamond search and are expected to spend
about ADollars 2m this year. They include De Beers' local subsidiary
Stockdale, CRA, Ashton Mining, and Poseidon.
The department of mines believes that the region could contain deposits of
gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, nickel, chromium and tin in addition to
diamonds.
The main focus of interest is the Gawler Craton, a huge geological block
that stretches over the Eyre Peninsula and north beyond Coober Pedy.
Mr Fardon says: 'Foreign companies are welcome in their own right but we
would prefer them to joint venture with an Australian company. And to
acquire tenements they must have a registered company in Australia'.

   Australia's Argyle diamond mine is expected to produce more than its target of 25 million carats this year, accounting for more than one-third of the world's diamond production, the Bureau of Mineral Resources said. 

   The bureau said the mine, which is 57%-owned by CRA Ltd., produced 21.4 million carats in 1986's first three quarters, in contrast to 7.1 million carats in all of 1985.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argyle digs deep for precious
prizes - The world's biggest diamond producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The massive, man-made Argyle dam is blood-red from the sandstone in the silt
carried to it by the Ord River after the wettest wet season experienced for
100 years in this remote region in the far north of Western Australia.
About half a metre of rain in the past month has washed out one of the roads
leading to the huge open pit at the Argyle diamond mine. But the weather has
not delayed a ADollars 100m project designed to ensure that Argyle remains
the world's biggest diamond producer into the next decade.
Argyle produced 7.9 tonnes of diamonds last year or 34 per cent of the
global total. However, as the pit goes deeper the deposit contains fewer
diamonds and Argyle has been spending so as to increase the tonnage of
material shifted each year - to about 40m tonnes.
This will give an extra 2m tonnes of ore (taking it to an annual 8.6m
tonnes) and should keep diamond output relatively constant for another seven
years. By that time the pit will have reached its maximum depth of 320
metres.
Argyle's diamond output is likely to rise a little this year and next before
falling back again in 1996, according to Mr Ron Bates, general manager,
operations.
By 1996 the pit's owners, CRA, the Australian affiliate of RTZ Corporation
of the UK, with 60 per cent, and Ashton Mining, about one-third owned by the
Malaysian Mining Corporation, will have to decide whether to build an
underground mine at the bottom of the pit. Mr Bates says Argyle has been
scouring the world for suitable low-cost underground mining methods but it
is far too early to say whether the scheme would be viable.
The partners' search for more diamond deposits nearby has drawn a blank so
far. The joint venturers spent ADollars 150m on exploration and feasibility
studies and then ADollars 475m to bring Argyle into production in 1985.
Since then the mine has produced about 40 tonnes of diamonds and given the
partners on average a handsome 30 per cent return on their investment.
Indications from the partners' annual results suggest that Argyle's output
last year was worth about ADollars 500m and produced an after tax profit of
about ADollars 100m for them to share.
Although Argyle ranks first in diamond output by weight, it is only sixth in
the world in the value of diamonds it produces. Some 5 per cent of the
diamonds from Argyle account for 50 per cent of its revenue while 50 per
cent are industrial stones of little value and produce only 5 per cent of
the revenue.
Mr Bates points out that in mining terms the industrial stones should be
seen as a by-product that must be extracted along with the mine's main
product. The remaining 45 per cent of the mine's output is of cheap gem
stones.
The key to Argyle's success, therefore, has been new technology that enables
it to sort billions of diamonds - many of them virtually worthless - a task
traditional sorting methods could not handle. CRA has developed a system
using X-rays to locate the diamonds in crushed ore - they glow in the beams
 -and then micro-computer-controlled machines blast air to blow each one out
of the material at a rate of up to 500 a second.

   A stone's throw from the smelly Smithfield meat
market is an office building complex with no sign or anything to
attract the attention of Londoners hurrying by.
   Mounted cameras, jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the
uninvited. The gold-colored interior is hushed and luxuriously
decorated.
   This is the Central Selling Organization, London-based marketing
arm of the De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy
Oppenheimer family of South Africa. Its experts sort mounds of
rough diamonds constituting 80 percent of the world's annual
production.
   But scratch the surface of this secretive world, and the diamond
business loses some sparkle.
   Sales have declined sharply, and the 56-year-old cartel is
facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to
sell more of their own gems.
   Although its prosperity and control of the world diamond
industry looks unchallengeable, the pressures could loosen its grip
and crimp its profits.
   ``This year is going to be a critical one for De Beers,'' says
Diamond Intelligence Briefs, a trade publication.
   De Beers' South African interests face an uncertain future,
largely because of a newly energized political will by the black
majority in that country, an important diamond producer. The
African National Congress has pledged to nationalize South Africa's
major sources of wealth if it takes power.
   Apparently attempting to limit risk, De Beers recently announced
it would split South African and foreign interests into two
publicly held companies, one based in Switzerland.
   After growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in
1988, rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to $4.09 billion last year
because of slowing economies, high interest rates and the
organization's two double-digit price increases in 1988 and 1989.
   The decline was sharpest in the second half of the year, when
sales fell 24 percent from the first six months.
   ``There was a very definite, noticeable slack in demand,'' said
analyst Peter Miller of Yorkton Securities Inc. in London.
   The decline has limited De Beers' scope for raising prices. This
past week, De Beers announced it was increasing prices 5.5 percent,
compared to a 15.5 percent increase a year earlier.
   The organization must this year renegotiate five-year contracts
with Botswana, the second biggest diamond producer in terms of
value, and Argyle Diamonds of Western Australia, the biggest
producer in terms of quantity.
   The government of newly independent Namibia, meanwhile, is
expected to demand a one-fifth stake in Consolidated Diamond Mines,
De Beers' Namibian subsidiary.
   The organization sells most of the Soviet Union's West-bound
diamonds, but the Soviets, the biggest value producer, have been
acting more independently and squeezing the cartel's margins, the
experts say.
   Jack Lunzer, managing director of IDC Ltd., an independent
diamond distributor in London, said De Beers undoubtedly will
continue to control the major part of world production, but its
marketing arm's profits will fall.
   The effect hasn't been felt yet; De Beers' profit rose 37
percent to $1.1 billion in 1989.
   Few diamond-producing countries dare sell their output outside
the organization, and some bold enough to leave have returned
because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone.
   Zaire returned in 1983 after a two-year split. Angola, which
broke in 1985, has been negotiating its re-entry.
   ``We are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have
been for many years,'' said Tim Capon, the cartel's director.
   The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines,
which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers
in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and
the Soviet Union.
   It reveals few details about security. It was robbed once, in
the early 1980s, when some diamonds were snatched as couriers
carried them from one building to another.
   De Beers picks its 160 or so buying customers from thousands of
hopefuls. Ten times a year, at sales called ``sights,'' the clients
are offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and
placed in a simple cardboard box. The buyer basically can take it
or leave it.
   The gems then go to cutters in the world's major diamond-cutting
centers: Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; Antwerp, Belgium; and New
York.
   Of all diamonds mined, only 15 percent will end up in jewelry,
but these represent 80 percent of the value of the world's diamond
production. The rest are put to industrial use.
   The organization is fighting the lackluster sales trend by
trying to create new demand. Last year, it spent $160 million on
advertising and promotion, trying, for example, to boost purchases
of men's diamond jewelry.
   De Beers's achievement over the decades has been to mass-market
what was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing
its value. Today, diamonds remain ``the gem of gems,'' although
millions of people own them.
   De Beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for
the industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence
in the value of diamonds.
   So far, it has succeeded. While other commodities markets have
suffered repeated convulsions, rough diamond prices haven't fallen
since the organization started announcing price changes in 1964.
   Even its fiercest competitors laud De Beers for putting up
considerable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop
mines and support the market.
   During the early 1980s, when high interest rates caused the
worst diamond slump since the 1930s, the organization prevented the
market's collapse by doubling its diamond stockpile to nearly $2
billion worth.
   But producers criticize the organization's secretiveness and
what they call its arbitrary valuation system. Some want more of
the industry's millions of jobs relocated in their own countries.
   Said Lunzer: ``It's not unnatural for people in the producing
countries to say, `Are we getting a proper share of the value of
our national resource?''' After reviewing a complaint filed by the
British mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC alleging
anti-competitive practices, Britain's Office of Fair Trading
decided in August against formally investigating whether the
organization abuses its monopoly.
   Gold Fields acknowledged the complaint was a defensive maneuver
against a hostile, and ultimately unsuccessful, takeover bid from
Oppenheimer-controlled Minorco SA last year.
   Formally known as De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and based in
Kimberley, South Africa, the company was formed in 1888 by the
British industrial colonialist Cecil Rhodes.
   Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of
De Beers in 1929 and five years later formed Diamond Trading Co.,
the precursor of today's cartel.
   Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive
Anglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with
steering De Beers through the Depression. He died in 1957 and was
succeeded by his son, Harry Oppenheimer, who has made the company
more internationally minded and therefore less vulnerable.
   Now 81, Oppenheimer still serves on De Beers' board of
directors, of which he previously was chairman. His 44-year-old son
and heir apparent, Nicholas, is deputy to Chairman Julian Ogilvie
Thompson.

foolish. The park, tucked into the lush pine forests of southwest Arkansas, is 
the only place in North America ever to produce gem-quality diamonds and the 
only diamond mine in the world that allows the public to find and keep the 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
For $3 (or $1.50 for children), visitors may dig and scratch at about 35 acres 
of gray volcanic soil and dream of finding a stone that will dwarf "Uncle Sam," 
the 40.23-carat record-holder found here in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
Already on this day, two lucky prospectors had found diamonds, bringing this 
year's count to 533. But the fun has been tempered by controversy lately, ever 
since the state decided it might sell the park's most productive sections to 
private mining concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, diamond-mining interests persuaded the Arkansas Department of 
Parks and Tourism to initiate testing to determine the size and shape of the 
diamond-bearing ore deposit. Four potential bidders put up $87,500 each to pay 
for the testing, and a Tennessee company under contract to the state began 
drilling on July 8 with an apparatus that resembles an oil-well drill rig. 
</P>
<P>
The test drilling prompted a federal lawsuit this year by conservationists who 
contend the tests are a prelude to full-scale commercial mining at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like shooting the last whooping crane or killing the last bald 
eagle," said Terry Horton, director of the environmentalist Arkansas Wildlife 
Federation, which is among the suit's plaintiffs. "It's so unique that the very 
idea of turning it into a commercial mining operation is vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
Since the state bought what had been a privately owned mine in 1972 for 
$750,000, about 14,000 diamonds have been plucked from it. The 889-acre park 
averages 700 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Gov. Bill Clinton appointed a task force to study the idea of 
commercializing the park. That led to the Department of Parks and Tourism's 
decision last year to give testing the go-ahead. The federal Department of the 
Interior, which granted the state $720,000 of the purchase price 18 years ago, 
initially opposed the drilling but changed its stance last July, although 
Clinton now says he is against commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several diamond-mining companies contended that commercial 
operation would be a boon to economically depressed Murfreesboro and its 1,900 
residents. A spokesman for Arkansas investors interested in a private mine said 
that such an operation would create 400 permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal drawn up by the task force two years ago set aside for the mining 
company the entire 35-acre field that the state now plows regularly for public 
mining and envisioned a huge pit reaching hundreds of feet deep. The state 
would keep part of the park for public use, but Jim Cannon, the park 
superintendent, said the rest of the park's ore deposits are of a different 
type that is too hard to plow. Opponents say commercialization would leave the 
public to scour the park's least productive areas and destroy the 
diamond-hunting experience. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' lawsuit contends that converting the public land to 
private use is illegal. The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund Act 
prohibits such conversion unless the lands taken away are replaced with other 
lands of like value and use. 
</P>
<P>
But the Interior Department allowed testing a year ago as a temporary 
non-conforming use. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright thus far has 
allowed the first phase of testing to continue but has hinted that she might 
rule on a permanent injunction by Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visitors continue to scan the surface and dig as usual, while the 
drill rig hums away.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will get more badly needed
foreign hard currency by selling its rough diamonds exclusively
through the South African giant De Beers in a five-year
multibillion-dollar agreement.
   The company is advancing the Soviets $1 billion against future
diamond sales, said officials who announced the agreement on
Wednesday.
   The Soviet Union, among the world's largest diamond producers,
reached the deal with De Beers because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African company because of apartheid, but now is willing to openly
do business with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   South Africa-based De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., controlled
by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa, established the
publicly-held Swiss company in May.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the USSR for the exclusive export
and sale of the Soviet Union's diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   It said its Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to make a secured advance of $1 billion to
Glavalmazzoloto against future diamond deliveries.
   Repayment would be made over five years beginning in November,
it said.
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said as a result of the agreement that the Soviet Union, at a time
of ``considerable financial strain,'' was assured ``a steady flow
of funds from diamonds'' during the life of the contract.
   Company officials estimated the contract could be worth as much
as $5 billion.
   Moscow has been seeking foreign credit as it tries to bring
market-oriented reform to an economy plagued by shortages.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the $1 billion advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization, as a result,
markets 80 percent of the world's rough diamond production of some
100 million carats.
   The organization had sales of $4.09 billion last year.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said. The Soviet Union doesn't disclose the value
of its output.

De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond business,
yesterday secured its position in Namibia for the next 25 years - or until
the diamonds run out - by effectively handing over to the government there
50 per cent of its subsidiary, CDM.
The company will be reconstituted as Namdeb Diamond Corporation in which De
Beers and the Namibian government will each own 50 per cent. The government
will not be putting any capital into the new organisation.
Mr Sam Nujoma, Namibia's president, said yesterday that his country would,
via tax and dividends, collect additional revenue from the country's diamond
operations. For the present financial year Namibia has budgeted to collect
USDollars 56m in taxes and duties from these operations, based on depressed
1993 earnings.
Nevertheless, the signs are that De Beers is pleased with the deal,
completed after two years of tough negotiations and similar to its
arrangement with the Botswana government.
The accord signed in Windhoek gives De Beers:
The assurance that it will be able to continue to exploit its existing on
and off-shore assets in the country and that its renewable prospecting
licences will protected;
A guarantee that all of Namdeb's output will be marketed through De Beers'
London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds;
Retained control of De Beers Marine, the company that provides the
technology and equipment for off-shore diamond mining. Debmarine, which last
year, in terms of carats, accounted for about one quarter of the diamonds
CDM produced, will have only a contractual relationship with Namdeb.
Also, CDM's part-interest in the Navachab gold mine, near Karibib, will be
retained by De Beers under the accord.
Revenues from diamonds account for 11 per cent of Namibia's gross domestic
product and 34 per cent of its export earnings.
Mr Nujoma said yesterday: 'No longer will Namibia's diamond industry lurk in
the darkness of suspicion and strike; we are now forging an equal
partnership subject to the disciplines of both public scrutiny and the
private market.'
CDM, which moves huge tonnages of beach sands to find most of its diamonds,
is by no means De Beers' largest producer. Its output, down from 1.5m carats
in 1992 to 1.1m last year, is overshadowed by Botswana's 14.7m carats, down
from nearly 16m.

DIAMOND SMUGGLING from Russia is adding to the turmoil in the market for the
precious stone, De Beers admitted yesterday, but the group, which controls
80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, said it had no clear
idea of the extent of the leakage.
Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for liaison with the
Russians, said it was impossible to tell how many diamonds were being
smuggled from the former Soviet Union.
He believed the smuggling was taking place without the sanction of the
government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing compared
with the illicit flood of diamonds out of Angola where an estimated Dollars
1m worth a day are being smuggled to Antwerp.
He said he understood some rough gems were being smuggled out by joint
ventures which only had the right to export polished stones. Mr Ralfe said
he could not disclose official figures for Russian diamond output but denied
one suggestion that production had fallen from 11m to 4m carats. 'We sell
well in excess of 4m carats a year.'
It also became clear yesterday De Beers faces competition from Japan in
Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes
to help set up a cutting centre.
In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the
Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing
five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough
diamond exports.
De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 which gives its Central Selling
Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russian rough diamonds exports until
1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the former Soviet Union against
stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London.
Though Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the agreement
has often been called into question. Mr Nicky Oppenheimer, De Beers deputy
chairman, said: 'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be
ended by a pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that
CSO is Russia's best opportunity.'

diamond links

<TEXT>
THE BELEAGUERED diamond market was cheered yesterday by news that De Beers,
the South African group that controls 80 per cent of world rough (uncut)
diamond trade, had signed an exclusive sales agreement with Yakutia, the
gold and diamond-rich area of eastern Siberia that is an autonomous republic
in the Russian Federation.
At the same time Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for the
Russian business, revealed that, although output from the republic's
existing diamond mines seemed to be going smoothly, development of a huge
new mine in Yakutia, called Jubilee, was delayed by at least two years.
Shortages of construction materials such as steel and cement had caused the
set-back at Jubilee, which was originally scheduled to start up last autumn.
De Beers' Central Selling Organisation signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year sales
contract with the Soviet Union in 1990 and at the same time advanced a loan
of Dollars 1bn. Diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as
collateral.
Recently Russia took over the diamond deal but repayments had continued
without interruption, said Mr Ralfe. So far Dollars 250m had been repaid in
capital and interest via sales from the diamond stocks.
In December Yakutia, which produces nearly all of Russia's diamonds -
estimated by the Terraconsult consultancy organisation at 12m carats worth
Dollars 1.14bn in 1991 - secured the right from Russia to retain 10 per cent
of its output for independent sale.
De Beers has now won the right to sell this 10 per cent.
In Mr Ralfe's words: 'This is the same cat skinned in a different way. But
the diamond market will be reassured that we have established direct links
with Yakutia, one of the world's biggest diamond producers'.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rabbi's blessing worries
regulator - The mystery surrounding an Australian mining share's price surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Securities Commission is investigating whether the
pronouncements of a 91-year old New York rabbi played a role in a share
buying spree that raised the market value of a small mining company from
ADollars 200m to ADollars 1bn in less than a month.
The commission also wants to know why a diamond strike described as
'significant' by Melbourne-based Great Central Mines is judged uneconomic by
its joint venture partner, Stockdale Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers,
the South African mining house.
Australian regulators became interested in Great Central when its share
price rose sharply in March, during a series of US 'roadshow' presentations
by Mr Joseph Gutnick, the chairman. The company's American Depositary
Receipts had just begun trading on the Nasdaq over-the-counter exchange.
The ADR price rose from USDollars 5 on March 10, when Mr Gutnick arrived in
the US, to about Dollars 14 on March 29. The price boom was paralleled in
Australia, where the shares soared from ADollars 4.45 to ADollars 18, mostly
on overseas buying.
Even by the speculative standards applied to exploration companies, the
valuation appeared generous. Great Central, which has no significant
operating income, made a net loss of ADollars 3.9m last year on turnover of
just ADollars 1.2m.
However, the identity of the buyers remains something of a mystery, as is
the reason behind the sudden surge in demand.
One colourful explanation that has surfaced in the US and Australia is that
the buyers were Lubavitcher Jews impressed by a video recording in which
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson says that gold is there for Mr Gutnick and
urges continued exploration.
Rabbi Schneerson is the Russian-born leader of the ultra-orthodox
Lubavitcher sect, based in the Crown Heights district of New York. The
movement has a worldwide following of about 200,000, and the Rabbi's words
 -disseminated by a large publishing organisation  - carry great weight
among Lubavitchers. Some regard him as a messiah.
But there are two serious flaws in the theory that the video recording
triggered the surge in demand for the shares:
The Rabbi's friendship with Mr Gutnick had been public knowledge among
Lubavitchers since at least 1987, and the video is several years old. It is
not clear why it should suddenly prompt a buying spree.
The video appears not to have been shown at Great Central's roadshows, and
the Rabbi's endorsement was not a major feature. Mr Herb Lanzet, the New
York-based public relations man who arranged the four-city tour, says he did
not see the 'rabbi video' until later, although a separate 'corporate video'
was produced for investors.
If the buyers were not zealous Lubavitchers, who were they? Efforts to
market the stock seem initially to have been confined to a select few. In
Denver, for example, none of the top brokerage houses were invited, nor were
the local gold-mining trade association or big institutional investors.
Mr Roger May, of a small broking house called Schneider Securities, did
receive a telephone call from Mr Lanzet, who was known to his firm, and a
visit from Mr Gutnick. But Mr May says that Great Central's two-man
presentation, made in Schneider's offices, was 'no real hype'.
Mr May bought ADRs for several accounts at USDollars 5.37 1/2 , which were
then sold at USDollars 12. 'Herb and Paul (Mr Lanzet's assistant) said it
was a good thing,' he says.
According to Mr Gutnick, the roadshows were designed to present Great
Central as a serious exploration company with significant prospects in both
gold and diamond mining.
No one disputes that Great Central has a knack for discovering gold mines.
Five years ago it found and then sold the Plutonic deposit in Western
Australia, which produces 200,000 ounces of gold a year. Now it is
evaluating another discovery at nearby Bronze Wing.
But there is controversy about Great Central's claim to have found a
promising diamond deposit on land at Nabberu, not far from Bronze Wing,
where it has a joint exploration arrangement with Stockdale.
Great Central told the Australian Stock Exchange last month that 'four fine
diamonds' had been discovered in what it had earlier described as a 'major
diamond bearing . . . province'.
A few days later, trading in the shares was temporarily suspended at the
company's request, pending the release by Stockdale of an evaluation report
requested by the exchange. When it came, the report said the joint venture
had found kimberlites (diamond bearing rock formations), but 'none . . .
has, thus far, been demonstrated to have economic potential'.
Mr Gutnick, who says the company has never claimed anything more than a
significant prospect at Nabberu, accuses Stockdale of playing down the
significance of the diamond find to protect its own interests in the area.
'De Beers have a reputation for trying to discredit any joint venture
partners that may be a threat to their monopoly,' he says. 'We are convinced
there is a good chance that there is a good quality diamond mine there
because de Beers has told us that."
Stockdale was reluctant to comment, but Mr Robert Danchin, exploration
manager asks why the company would play down the prospects of a potential
mine in which it is a joint venturer.
'I am heartily fed up with the whole business,' he says.
Stockdale's bearish assessment of the diamond prospect has taken some of the
steam out of the shares, but Great Central is still trading at about
ADollars 14, valuing the company at more than ADollars 750m.
Mr Gutnick, meanwhile, is plainly unfazed by the sudden publicity
surrounding his company. He has returned to the US, where he is conducting a
second 'road-trip'. Accompanied by Great Central's geologist and an outside
gem specialist, he has visited Florida, Atlanta, St Louis and is now heading
on to Chicago  - the second visit to the Windy City. This time, Great
Central's ADRs have behaved more sedately, fluctuating around the USDollars
10-mark.

FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oppenheimer to visit Moscow as
diamond shake-up looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HARRY Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa and De Beers, is to visit Russia next week at a
time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond
industry.
His visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife
with rumours about unofficial exports from Russia contributing to the
present market turmoil which might force De Beers to cut its dividend
payment this year.
Some industry observers suggest that the presence in Russia of Mr
Oppenheimer, who will be 84 in October, will be timely. 'It appears to be
another sign that the former De Beers' chairman is taking a more active role
in guiding the company through its current difficulties,' says the
Diamantaire newsletter today.
De Beers said yesterday that the visit by Mr Oppenheimer, accompanied by his
son Nicholas, was a private one originally arranged for August last year but
postponed because of the coup d'etat in the former Soviet Union.
However, it admitted that Mr Oppenheimer would be meeting senior officials
from the Russian diamond industry during his stay because he would be going
to some of the big mines in Siberia and would be present when De Beers held
the formal opening of its Moscow office on September 8.
De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80
per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a Dollars
5bn, five-year sales contract with the former Soviet Union and at the same
time advanced a loan of Dollars 1bn. Diamond stocks were moved from Moscow
to London as collateral for the loan.
After the break-up of the Soviet Union the contract was continued with
Rosalmazzoloto, the Russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusive
sales agreement was later signed with Yukutia, the area in eastern Siberia
where most Russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous
republic in the Russian Federation.
A CSO spokesman said yesterday: 'The Russian contract is working. Everything
is normal.'
Diamantaire points out that the Russian parliament is to consider next month
a plan to set up a state diamond centre under the control of the finance
ministry and Komdragmet, formerly know as Gokhran, the Moscow depository of
diamonds.
Reports suggest that the diamond centre would have exclusive rights to buy
all rough diamonds mined in the Russian Federation and it would also have a
monopoly of sorting gem diamonds.
These proposals are being opposed by the Yakut government, which is backing
a joint-stock company, Almazy Rossli (Diamonds of Russia), being set up with
Mr Valery Rudakov, formerly in charge of Rosalmazzoloto, at its head.
Rosalmazzoloto is to be broken up.
Almazy Rossli proposes to bring all the diamond industry's operations under
one roof, says Diamantaire.
Observers expect Mr Oppenheimer to bring his formidable negotiating skills
to bear to ensure that De Beers grip on the diamond market is in no way
weakened by any changes in Russia.
Meanwhile, the newsletter, which is available only to subscribers to Diamond
International magazine, also says that reports in Antwerp suggest that two
of the Belgian diamond trading organisations with which the CSO has a
special relationship have been punished by temporarily being excluded from
the CSO's 'sights' or diamond sales. The CSO invites only about 160
privileged merchants to its ten 'sights' a year in London, Lucerne and
Kimberley.
Diamantaire says that one of the Belgian organisations has had dealings with
Russia for more than 20 years.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Saskatchewan ripe for diamond
rush'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's next diamond rush is likely to be in Saskatchewan, according to
Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French banking group.
'Saskatchewan has a very high potential for the discovery of an economic
diamond deposit over the next few years,' suggests analyst Mr Charles
Kernot.
Diamond hunting in the province has been going on spasmodically since 1948
but was given a boost by the recent diamond rush in Canada's Northwest
Territories. The most high-profile operation in Saskatchewan is a joint
venture between two uranium companies, Cameco and Uranerz Exploration, which
has found diamonds in the Fort a la Corne region. Monopros, the exploration
arm of De Beers, the world's biggest diamond group, is earning a 33 per cent
interest in that project and providing access to its sampling laboratories
in Johannesburg.
Credit Lyonnais has a vested interest in Saskatchewan diamonds because it is
in the process of raising CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.5m) net from European
investors for Kensington Resources, a small Vancouver-quoted company that is
exploring for gems in the province. Kensington has hired the head of the
Saskatchewan ministry of energy and minerals' diamond exploration programme,
Mr Malcolm Gent, as a consultant.
De Beers is moving into diamond mining in Ghana. The South African group
will spend USDollars 1m to re-evaluate state-owned Ghana Consolidated
Diamonds' Birim River reserves. If the outcome is positive Ghana's
government will take 20 per cent of a new company, Birim River Diamonds, and
De Beers will share the rest with Lazare Kaplan, a US merchant. Meanwhile,
De Beers will take over management of GCD's existing operations and expects
to double output of mainly near-gem and industrial-quality diamonds to more
than 400,000 carats in the coming year.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: The glittering prize that was
almost overlooked - Kenneth Gooding talks to the British-born lady geologist
who in 1972 found Australia's first diamond
</HEADLINE>

Companies scrambling to take part in Australia's biggest diamond exploration
boom for many years owe a great debt to Ms Maureen Muggeridge.
This British-born geologist earned a place in geological history when she
found Australia's first diamond in 1972 - before that many experts believed
there were no diamonds to be found in the country, despite its huge size,
because the geology was wrong.
She was also part of the team that seven years later located the Argyle AK1
deposit in the far north of Western Australia, one of the country's most
important mineral discoveries and now the world's largest diamond producer,
at least in terms of the weight.
Ms Muggeridge, now 46, was born in Croydon, near London, and is the niece of
the late Mr Malcolm Muggeridge, the eccentric British writer. She spent her
childhood in Nigeria and earned her geology degree at St Andrew's
University, Glasgow. She recalls she then set out for Australia 'to get some
sunshine unquote'.
She was given a job by Tanganyika Holdings, which then was the only company
seriously exploring for diamonds in Australia, apart from, inevitably, De
Beers, the South African group which dominates the industry, via its
subsidiary Stockdale. Tanganyika was eventually absorbed by CRA, one of
Australia's big mining groups and one capable of finding the large sums
required to finance a diamond mine.
Ms Muggeridge recalls that the vital clues to the massive Argyle deposit
were nearly missed. 'I was a bit pushy and insisted we leave no gaps in the
exploration work.' So with only one geologist assistant she set out in a
helicopter on what proved to be an immensely profitable sortie for CRA. One
consolation was that her assistant on that trip was Mr John Towie, now a
director of rival Australian diamond exploration group, Triad Minerals, whom
she had then just wed.
The 38 diamond grains in the sample they sent back for testing could have
fitted easily on the head of a match. Once those traces had been found,
however, it was an easy task to trace them back to the Argyle deposit.
'Searching for diamonds is much worse than looking for a needle in a
haystack,' says Ms Muggeridge. 'At least you can burn down the haystack and
use a metal detector. Success in diamond exploration depends heavily on the
expertise of the people involved and, because diamonds and their host rocks
are so rare, they are extremely hard to find and a long term approach is an
absolute necessity.'
For the past five years she has been exploration director of Moonstone
Diamond Corporation, which last November raised ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m)
on the Australian Stock Exchange, enough for two year's exploration work.
Ms Muggeridge was among the speakers at the first Australian Diamond
Conference here in Perth last week.
The standing room only event was one indication of how diamond fever has
taken hold in Western Australia. Another came from Mr Michael Thomson of
stockbrokers Eyres Reed when he estimated that in the past year diamond
exploration companies in Australia had raised at least ADollars 72m.
As usual in mining booms, many of the companies involved are as interested
in bulling up their share prices as in looking for gem stones. This has led
to some unease and complaints, particularly about the way some report their
exploration results - so far no set procedures have been fixed for this.
At the conference Mr Wolf Marx, convener of the diamond reporting committee
of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, read from a number
of recent explorers' reports that left out crucial information such as the
value of diamonds found or referred to values or even connotations of value
(such as 'gem' or 'near gem') of a small number of diamonds that were
potentially misleading.
'Diamond exploration geologists, exploration managers and even chairmen of
mining companies are unlikely to have sufficient expertise to give accurate
assessments of diamond values,' he explained. 'This is made worse if the
stones are micro diamonds which, by definition, cannot be considered to have
any value other than scientific.'
Delegates cheered up, however, when Mr Chris Jennings, an international
explorer associated with the discoveries in the North West Territories that
caused Canada's recent diamond rush, said new technical expertise and
knowledge justified more exploration in Australia, including in those areas
already studied for diamonds. 'Since Argyle there has been no intense
exploration in Australia,' he said. 'There are probably big areas where
there is some sort of potential for diamonds - I feel confident about it.'
Nevertheless, finding those diamonds will not be easy. Mr Yannic Mercier,
Geneva-based chairman of Ms Muggeridge's Moonstone Corporation, jokingly
told delegates that when he was first invited to invest he replied: 'Setting
up a diamond exploration company raises only two questions; how much money
you want to lose and how long will you give yourself to lose it'.

<HEAD>Lazare Kaplan Diamond Deal Sign of Hopefulness in Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillion dollar agreement to import
Angola's diamonds announced this month by New York-based Lazare
Kaplan International could translate into more than just much-needed
hard currency to the war-ravaged southern African nation.
   Under terms negotiated with Endiama, the Angolan state diamond
company, Lazare Kaplan will import $20 million a year in
high-quality, uncut gem diamonds for processing at its plant in
Caguas, Puerto Rico, company spokeswoman Amy Wiener said in a
telephone interview from New York.
   Wiener said the first shipment has arrived for cutting and
polishing in the plant.
   The agreement is the first major international business deal
announced with the Marxist-oriented government since the signature
Dec. 22 of U.S.-brokered accords by Angola, Cuba and South Africa on
the phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   The withdrawal is being made in return for the independence of
the South African-controlled territory of Namibia, formerly known as
South-West Africa.
   ``I was impressed by the fact that all those with whom we met in
Luanda took a business-like, non-ideological approach,'' LKI
Chairman Maurice Tempelsman said in a company news release.
   ``In view of the close diplomatic cooperation between the
American and Angolan authorities in connection with the withdrawal
of South African and Cuban forces from Angola and Namibia, there is
no reason why this agreement should not be followed by many mutually
beneficial examples of economic cooperation between our two
countries.''
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Angola, which
gained independence from Portugal in 1975 after a 14-year colonial
war and has since been fighting U.S.-and South African-backed rebels.
   Ms. Wiener said the diamond importing agreement, the first LKI
has made with Angola, was indirectly related to the December accords.
   ``The peace process was moving forward, and continues to move
forward,'' she said. ``It can only help business, and we're
encouraged by it.''
   South Africa agreed to stop supporting Jonas Savimbi and his
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, but the United
States continues to supply about $15 million a year in military aid
through bases in neighboring Zaire.
   Before his inauguration, President Bush wrote Savimbi assuring
him of continued U.S. support in order to pressure Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos into negotiating.
   Nearly 90 percent of Angola's hard currency earnings come from
oil pumped mainly by an Angolan-American consortium in fields near
the mouth of the Zaire River.
   Under Portuguese rule, Angola was exporting between 5 percent and
8 percent of the world's diamond production. Exports fell following
independence but rose in 1981-82 to 1.3 million carats worth $165
million.
   In 1987 the Portuguese company SPE (Portuguese Entrepreneurial
Society) signed a cooperation agreement with Endiama, and 50
Portuguese technicians are working in Angola as diamond mining
advisers.
   A delegation from Endiama visited Lisbon earlier this month
following a trip to the United States, and there have been newspaper
reports here of a possible joint venture between Portugal and Angola
in mining and finishing.
   Throughout the 1980s Portugal has been an illicit export route
for unfinished Angolan diamonds. The Lisbon daily Europeu said the
illicit trade amounted to $200 million in 1983 alone.
   In 1984, Savimbi-led rebels attacked diamond mines in
northeastern Angola, and production fell off sharply.
   The area was later divided into production blocs and leased to
mining companies in the same way Angola has awarded concessions to
oil companies. The Angolan army now provides security in the
diamond-mining areas.
   Ms. Wiener said LKI does not plan to become involved in actual
diamond mining in Angola.

diamond mine

BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner have given the clearest indications
yet that they are set to go ahead with construction of North America's first
diamond mine in the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories.
Announcing another round of encouraging drilling results, BHP and Dia-Met
Minerals said that they planned to expand the airstrip at the remote site
300km north-east of Yellow-knife. About 170 people are already working at
the site.
BHP is also assembling data for environmental impact studies, and holding
talks with local communities to address their concerns about mining
development.
The partners are not scheduled to make a final decision on a mine until the
end of this year. But Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in
Toronto, predicted that, based on the latest results, BHP and Dia-Met will
initially develop two high-grade kimberlite pipes, known as Koala and Panda.
The latest sample from Koala, weighing 1,193 tonnes, yielded 6,600 diamonds
with a total weight of 893 carats. The average grade was 0.75 carats a
tonne. The Panda pipe, which is almost adjacent to Koala, yielded a total of
270 carats from 230 tonnes of ore, giving an average grade of 1.18 carats a
tonne.
BHP and Dia-Met also announced the first results from two other pipes,
Misery and Falcon. The Misery deposit, which is 44km from Koala, produced a
grade of 0.75 carats a tonne from a sample of 132 tonnes. These results
included one 4.2 carat stone 'of very significant value'.
The partners were expected to disclose further details of their plans at
Dia-Met's annual meeting yesterday at its head office in Kelowna, British
Columbia.

   Two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper
and iron-ore mining scene of far northern Michigan.
   It started as a glint in a Dow Chemical Co. metallurgist's eye.
First Dow, and now a Colorado company, Crystal Exploration Inc.,
entered the search for diamonds in the state's Upper Peninsula.
   Seven Kimberlite pipes _ volcanic rock shafts that can yield the
earth's hardest mineral _ have been discovered.
   Core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sand-grain sized
diamonds, too few and too small for commercial production. But the
explorers say the search is young.
   The pipe formations are in a 40-mile area around Iron Mountain
and Crystal Falls, at the western end of the Upper Peninsula along
the Wisconsin border.
   In the few places on earth they are found, Kimberlite pipes
occur in clusters of up to several dozen, said James Huml, a Dow
research associate.
   Huml, a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation, said
he thinks there are more than a dozen Kimberlite pipes in the Upper
Peninsula.
   Dow has searched for six years. Now more exploration and mining
expertise is needed, Huml said. ``Dow is not a hard-rock mining
company.''
   Dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data, for an
undisclosed amount, to Crystal Exploration Inc., a Colorado
subsidiary of Sydney, Australia's Restech International Ltd.
Restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in
western Australia.
   It will carry on the search, while Dow holds onto an option to
take part in the exploration and development, and to share in any
profits.
   Occasional diamond finds in Ohio farm fields in the late 1800s
and early 1900s long had geologists looking to the north, said
Crystal Exploration's president, Sigfried Muessig.
   Muessig said a Kimberlite pipe, named for Kimberly in the
diamond-mining region of South Africa, is the only formation known
to produce the gems.
   ``It is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up
120 miles from the bowels of the earth, and the heat and pressure
have formed the diamonds,'' he said.
   ``It's a very rare occurrence,'' Huml said. Other Kimberlite
pipes have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado.
None commercially produce diamonds.
   There were no volcanic remnants in Ohio, so geologists thought
glaciers carried the diamonds there from Canada, Muessig said.
   But he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the U.S. Geological
Survey found a Kimberlite formation _ the Lake Ellen Pipe _ about
10 miles northeast of Crystal Falls.
   It was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200
million years ago in the Upper Peninsula, and possibly generated
the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind.
   The glaciers flattened the volcanoes, but since 1981 Dow has
found six more Kimberlite pipes _ several hundred feet across at
the surface and covered by volcanic debris, Huml said.
   In Dow's explorations, he said, ``We have found microdiamonds,
generally small, less than a millimeter in diameter. They are
grain-sized.''
   But the explorers still think the western Upper Peninsula was
the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south. ``We
think there is good potential, because of the historical finds,''
Muessig said.
   Crystal Exploration will do more sampling in the already
discovered pipes in the next year, Muessig said, and will continue
exploring for more Kimberlite formations, ``in hopes the next pipe
we discover will have gem-quality stones.''

ASHTON MINING, 40 per cent owner of Australia's big Argyle diamond mine, has
entered the Lac de Gras diamond hunt in Canada's Northwest Territories,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. It has formed a joint venture with a
Canadian exploration company and has shipped four tonnes of mineral samples
to its laboratories for testing.
So far Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary, the UK's RTZ (through Kennecott,
its US subsidiary) and De Beers of South Africa have been the only prominent
international companies known to be active in the hunt. Altogether 5.2m
hectares (13m acres) have been staked.

   DE BEERS CONSOLIDATED MINES LTD. said it reached agreement with South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers for wage increases covering about 9,000 black diamond miners. 

   The agreement, reached after four months of negotiations, provides for a wage increase of 18%, or 70 rand ($34.22) a month, for an unskilled, novice miner. 
That will raise the minimum wage at the group's mines to 480 rand ($234.60) a month. 

   Overall, wage increases for eight categories of worker were agreed upon. 
A skilled miner in the top category will receive a monthly increase of 190 rand, raising the top monthly wage to 1,400 rand. 

   The increases are retroactive to May at some mines and to June at others. 

   De Beers controls more than 80% of the world's diamond market. 

   At the end of August, the National Union of Mineworkers ended a three-week strike against gold and coal mines. 
The union won increased vacation pay and improved death benefits. 
It had sought an across-the-board wage increase of 27%, but the mine owners stuck to the boosts of between 15% and 23% implemented prior to the strike.

FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers remains in the dark
about extent of Russian diamond smuggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African group which controls about 80 per cent of the
world's rough (uncut) diamond trade, yesterday admitted it had no clear idea
of how many gem stones were being smuggled out of Russia.
It also became clear yesterday that De Beers faces competition from Japan in
Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes
to help set up a cutting centre.
In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the
Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing
five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough
diamond exports.
De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 that gives its Central Selling
Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russian rough diamond exports until
1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the former Soviet Union against
stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London.
However, though Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the
agreement has repeatedly been called into question.
'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be ended by a
pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that CSO is
Russia's best opportunity,' said De Beers deputy chairman, Mr Nicky
Oppenheimer.
Mr Valery Skripchenko, the deputy head of a group within Russia's budget
committee which is looking into the structure of the diamond industry,
suggested yesterday that De Beers was also seeking a monopoly of Russian
exports of polished stones in addition to that it enjoyed for rough gems. He
suggested a fresh parliamentary investigation could be launched when
parliament reconvened on September 22.
His objections appear to have been prompted by an outline agreement reached
last week by De Beers with Yakutia, the semi-autonomous republic within
Russia, to set up a stone-polishing factory.
Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers' director responsible for liaison with Russia,
said that if the agreement went through, his group would supply technology
for the plant and 'help' sell the polished stones it produced - which would
still account for a tiny proportion of rough gems mined in Yakutia.
But if Yakutia instead concluded a diamond-polishing deal with a rival
Japanese company called ARDA, De Beers would have no control over polished
stones sales by Yakutia, which does not yet have its own stone-cutting
capacity.
Asked about the smuggling problem, Mr Ralfe said it was impossible to tell
how many diamonds were leaking from the former Soviet Union in contravention
of the 1990 agreement. He believed smuggling was taking place without the
sanction of government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing
like on the scale of the illegal flood of diamonds out of Angola.

<HEAD>Office of Fair Trading To Investigate Complaint Against De Beers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was
investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a
London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De
Beers diamond organization.
   The watchdog body said De Beers ``appeared to have'' a monopoly
on diamond trading in London and it was interested in establishing
whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly.
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no
diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a
defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based
Minorco SA.
   Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South
Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and
diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   The British government is expected to rule in the next few weeks
whether to allow Minorco to proceed with its 2.9 billion-pound
(about $5.1 billion) bid for Consolidated Gold following an
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   A Consolidated Gold spokesman, commenting on condition he was not
identified, said the company wanted to point up the ``monopolistic
tendencies'' of South Africa's Anglo-American group of companies.
   De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent
of world diamond trading, has been based in London for 60 years.
   As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South
African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond
producers including Zaire, Australia, Botswana and the Soviet Union.
   The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish
whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization
because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African
company.
   There is no time limit on the office's investigation. After it is
completed, the Office of Fair Trading may decide to refer the
complaint to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   A spokesman for the Central Selling Organization said the Office
of Fair Trading notified the organization about the inquiry but
hadn't yet requested any information.
   ``It's still early'' in the investigation, said the spokesman,
commenting on condition he was not identified.
   De Beers's shares were unchanged Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange at $12 (U.S.).

   Tourists dream of instant wealth at
North America's only diamond-mining park. But companies with the
same hopes for the Crater of Diamonds State Park have
environmentalists worried.
   ``This land belongs to the public and should be preserved, not
used to line somebody's pockets,'' said Jim Stanley, a Little Rock
attorney representing the Sierra Club, part of a coalition of
environmental groups threatening legal action to stop the potential
exhaustion of a unique natural resource.
   Retiree James Archer is a regular among the 700 visitors a day
who sweat and swear on diamond digs for just a $3 admission ticket.
Archer, 64, shovels clumps of dirt into a wire-screened pan then
dunks it vigorously in a large tub of water, allowing heavy
material _ diamonds, he hopes _ to settle. Most of his pans turn up
nothing and others produce diamonds the size of a pinhead. But for
the discoverer even small stones carry the satisfaction of
Tiffany's finest.
   ``I don't care if I find a big diamond,'' Archer said. ``I just
want to keep a-digging.''
   The largest diamond found at the park was a 40-carat, 33-point,
light-pink stone unearthed in 1925 by miners and dubbed ``Uncle
Sam.'' The largest found by a tourist was a 16-carat, 37-point,
white stone dug up in 1975.
   The state has moved cautiously in its authorization of
commercial core drilling on the 35-acre field in southwestern
Arkansas. Gov. Bill Clinton in 1986 appointed a Diamond Mining
Advisory Task Force to study the idea of mining at the park, and
the state Parks and Tourism Commission distributed paperwork to
more than 50 companies or individuals who might be interested.
   ``It has forced us to ask a lot of questions about what we
really want out of the only resource of its kind in the U.S.,''
said Richard Davies, the acting director of the Parks and Tourism
Department.
   ``It also made us realize that we made some strategic mistakes
at the park, because the crater is not very user-friendly.'' A
35-acre plowed field where people can look for diamonds is
inaccessible to the handicapped and doesn't have water fountains,
restrooms or other amenities.
   The commission voted last month to work with four companies who
will share the estimated $350,000 cost of initial studies plus the
cost of any litigation. Test drilling could begin by April if the
process is not delayed by a lawsuit by the Sierra Club and the
Friends of the Crater of Diamonds.
   ``This is something completely new in mineral exploration,''
said John Morgan, a consulting engineer who served as a state
adviser. ``You have four companies cooperating with the state to
conduct tests in the most effective manner. Normally, they would be
slitting each other's throats.''
   Should the state decide to allow mining, only the companies
paying for the initial studies will be allowed to seek digging
rights, Davies said. ``I think a lot of these companies are used to
spending money on a gamble.''
   Environmentalists who attended an earlier commission meeting at
which preliminary core drilling was approved say even those tests
could mean diamonds aren't forever at the park. ``We see this as a
foot-in-the-door type thing. If they get the test drilling in
there, it defeats the principle of inviolacy of park lands,'' said
Stanley, the Sierra Club attorney.
   ``It's a lose-lose situation. If the results come back and they
say there are lots of diamonds there may be incredible pressure to
open it to commercial mining. If they come back and say it's a dry
hole, then much of the mystique of the park may disappear.
   ``We prefer to leave a little bit of the aura of mystery out
there.''
   To allow tests, the Interior Department had to grant a
``temporary non-recreational use'' of the diamond field. ``This is
a political decision,'' said Dean Banks, coordinator of Friends of
Crater of Diamonds State Park.
   Past drilling has shown that the diamond-bearing ore goes down
at least 205 feet. Six to 10 feet of earth have been scraped away
in 50 years, so the park could last centuries, said Superintendent
Jim Cannon. No projections have a commercial site in production
past about 50 years, he said.
   Cannon, 39, doesn't like to talk politics, but he does like to
brag about the crater, where he has been in charge since 1973.
``Personally, I'm cautious about any major changes in the park that
would have a major impact, and this certainly would have a major
impact,'' he said of testing.
   Attempts for more than a century to commercially mine diamonds
at the site have flopped, he said, because of a lack of experience
or capital. The mine was idle when the state acquired it for
$750,000 in 1972.
   Bad luck and bad feelings also figured in past failures, Cannon
said. One father-son team found itself facing 36 lawsuits after a
year in operation and their mining plant was gone after three
mysterious fires in one night.
   The four companies that will take part in the studies are
Continental Diamonds, 51 percent owned by Galactic Resources Ltd.,
of Vancouver, Canada; Arkansas Diamond Development Co., owned by
Sunshine Mining Co. and Exdiam Inc., both of Dallas, and Rhombus
Inc. of Little Rock; Capricorn Diamonds of West Perth, Australia;
and Kennecott Inc. of Salt Lake City.
   Such companies may offer improved technology and big backing,
according to Cannon. Even so, they're gambling _ just like the
hopeful tourists who slog through the often muddy field bearing
shovels and pans.
   ``It's a combination of curiosity and quick riches. Gambling _
an idea of buying a $3 ticket and perhaps finding something of
untold worth.''

<DATELINE> ORANJEMUND, Namibia  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach. 
Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones. 
It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu. 

   Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, searching for that unusual glint. 
But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work. 
Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram. 
Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards. 

   "If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them," says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager. 

   Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box. 
Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality. 
While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use. 

   Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one. 
Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations. 
When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers. 
Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval. 

   The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa. 
Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, proving diamonds aren't forever. 
Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents. 
Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers. 
On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag. 
The wind, stinging with sand, never seems to stop. 

   Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming. 
And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds. 
There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling. 
The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world. 
Last year, when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course, the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood. 
"Nothing is too good for our golf course," says Tony George, a mining engineer. 

   Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10. 

   Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes. 
Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss-cross the beach. 

   Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean. 
Made of sand, it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves. 
When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward. 
A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard. 
Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier, but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood. 
Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that, inexplicably, held against the waves. 

   "The Caterpillar people aren't too happy when they see their equipment used like that," shrugs Mr. George. 
"They figure it's not a very good advert." 

   Despite all these innovations, most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named "bedrock sweepers" who toil in the wake of the excavators. 
Laboring in blue and gray overalls, they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices, and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds. 
But should they spy one, the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value. 
For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail. 

   Still, employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two. 
One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie. 
Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe. 
A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail. 
None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security.

   Soviets Will Sell Diamonds to De Beers's
   Swiss Arm, Borrow $1 Billion From Firm

   LONDON -- The cash-strapped Soviet Union is selling
diamonds worth $5 billion to the Swiss arm of De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd. and is borrowing $1 billion from the
company.
   The contract between De Beers Centenary AG and
Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet adminstration for precious metals
and diamonds, is for the exclusive sale of Soviet rough uncut
diamonds over five years, said Gary Ralfe, a director of De
Beers Centenary. The company also received $1 billion of
diamonds as collateral, and Mr. Ralfe said these diamonds
would be sold during the five-year period to redeem the debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The deal obviously suits both parties, London diamond
dealers say. The Soviet Union has been having difficulty
paying its overseas trade creditors, and De Beers wants to
stop the Soviet Union and other producing nations from
selling increasing amounts of diamonds outside the De Beers
diamond cartel.
   De Beers is negotiating new sales contracts with Botswana
and Australia, so guaranteed diamond supplies from the
Soviets will encourage other members to toe the line, dealers
said. The South African cartel, which controls 80% of the
international rough diamond market, sells stones from its own
mines and those of other African countries, Australia and
elsewhere through its London-based Central Selling
Organization.
   While De Beers Centenary is a Swiss company, Mr. Ralfe
said the sale represented the first time in nearly three
decades that the Soviet Union had openly associated itself
with commodities dealings linked to a South African company.
South Africa and the Soviet Union are the world's biggest
producers of gold, platinum and a variety of strategic
metals, and in the past few years sometimes surreptitiously
cooperated on sales tactics, dealers say. The Soviet Union,
for example, sold its diamonds to the De Beers diamond cartel
through intermediaries, Mr. Ralfe said.
   "This is a very important deal for both the Soviet Union
and De Beers," said Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of
De Beers. The Soviet Union is raising $1 billion at a time of
considerable financial strain, while the contract will
contribute to the continued stability and prosperity of the
international diamond industry, he said.
   Estimates that the Soviet Union produces 12 million carats
of diamonds a year, or 13% of world output, are conservative,
Mr. Ralfe said. Its mines in the Yaktia region of
northeastern Siberia are rich, and the Soviet Union and
Botswana are the two largest producers of gem diamonds in the
world, he said.
   Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, the Soviet state
bank, announced previously that the Soviet Union would sell
and deposit gold and other commodities as collateral to raise
about $2.5 billion. Indeed, about 200 to 300 metric tons of
gold deposited as collateral with Western banks, has already
been "swapped" for foreign exchange, bullion dealers
estimate. The nation is forced to use commodities as
collateral for loans because delays in payments to suppliers
in the West and Japan are discouraging foreign banks from
lending it money, analysts say.
   Those sales may already be having an effect: Just
yesterday, a Japanese trade organization reported that
Moscow's overdue payments for Japanese exports had leveled
off in June, after rising for six straight months. The group
said payment arrears by Soviet trading organizations totaled
$446 million at the end of June, only a $2 million increase
from May. The trade group attributed the leveling off both to
increased payments by the Soviets and to the fact that
Japan's trading houses were more hesitant about doing
business with Soviet concerns.
   "I believe this problem is passing its peak," an official
of one major Japanese trading house told Japan's Kyodo news
service.
   Moscow's foreign borrowings amounted to as much as $43
billion at the end of 1989, estimates the Bank for
International Settlements.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Botswana tries to loosen De
Beers' grip - The world diamond cartel faces strong calls for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana, the world's most important
diamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South African group which
controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking
much longer than expected. The previous three-year contract ended on
December 31.
Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract
so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the
South African group's international cartel. This would give Botswana its own
'market window' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market.
De Beers is resisting any change. Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the
group's Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to
sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO's ability
to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.
He said: 'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell
exclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly
market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.'
However, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most
experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO,
suggests the CSO's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual
argument with little substance in fact.'
In presentations to Botswana's Minerals Policy Committee and members of
parliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially
essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output,
but that the country had a political responsibility to do so.
'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position
to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' IDC
pointed out. 'On a political level this would enable the government to
answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when
questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral
assets.'
If Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth
about USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars
4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to
market stability, IDC said.
It claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers' diamond
profits in 1989 came from Botswana. 'This profit is disproportionate to the
sale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO
as a percentage of the CSO's total sales profits,' IDC says.
'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the
only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the
CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale
of its diamonds.'
Other substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and
Australia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have
access to independent market information.
IDC does have a vested interest. It already markets diamonds for producers
in Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering
to do some marketing for Botswana.
It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's
efforts to keep the diamond market stable. But 'the fact that the CSO forms
part of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary
responsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.'
De Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account
profits - but it will not divulge the true figure.
It suggests IDC's arguments are flawed because they are based on an
assumption that Botswana needs more market information. However, in common
with other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed
independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the
prices paid.
According to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market
conditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.
Mr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that
the assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and
that the agreed contract price is paid. 'He is not a trader, he does not
know what the stones are worth in the market.'
De Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the
country is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. It is not the first
time that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.
The Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De
Beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's
understanding of the market.
There has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since
1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for
an estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South
African group.
Analysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case. De
Beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough
diamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania,
Zaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.
Prices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year
since the 1930s depression. But now De Beers is steering the world's most
successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the
recession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in
Japan (the second-largest), and the Gulf war.
To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great
expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. Its
promotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a
week - Dollars 53m for the year.
In addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982
and, according to De Beers' calculations, one of its diamond mines  - Orapa
 -needs investment of USDollars 600m.
The CSO has also notched up some recent coups: bringing a big part of the
Soviet Union's and Angola's rough diamond output back into the cartel - or
what it calls its 'single channel marketing' - arrangements.
However, the CSO is also currently involved in contract negotiations with
Argyle Diamonds, the western Australian company which is the biggest
individual diamond producer in volume (but only sixth in value) terms.
Argyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 -
but on more favourable terms.
A delegation from Botswana is to meet CSO representatives in London at the
end of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock. The industry is
betting that Botswana will give way, perhaps in return for De Beers helping
to finance the Orapa mine investment. However, the 'market window' idea is
unlikely to be dropped and will almost certainly be raised again when the
next contract negotiations start.

<HL> De Beers Plans to Raise Diamond Prices
By 10% Next Month as Demand Surges

   Flexing its muscles as a cartel, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month. 

   The South African concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say. 
So the increase could be as much as 20% on top-grade diamonds. 
The rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year. 

   "The diamond price increase was expected," said Jacques Zucker, of Lachowsky Zucker, diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium. 
By changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said. 

   "Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values," Mr. Zucker said. 
"Now they must accept higher prices." 

   "The price rise provides the necessary psychological lift to the market," said Peter Miller, a mining analyst at Shearson Lehman Securities in London. 
It will help the diamond producers "consolidate their gains." 

   Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said. 
In 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980. 
A carat equals 200 milligrams. 

   De Beers decided to raise prices because rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over its own quotes on the open market, said Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman. 
Demand is especially buoyant in the Far East. 
In the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added. 

   After the U.S., Japan is the second biggest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. 
Only one out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings less than two decades ago; now more than two-thirds buy. 

   "The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers," Mr. Lamont says. 
Stronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says. 
Diamonds are priced in U.S. dollars. 

   Demand for polished diamonds in the U.S., Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, and the Philippines also raised exports of the leading diamond cutting and dealing centers, primarily Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York. 

   To meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986. 

   Sales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion. 
Analysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987. 

   Yet some dealers worry because world diamond production surged to 89.6 million carats last year from 47 million carats in 1982. 
Only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say. 

   De Beers surprised skeptics and revived trade from the slump in the first half of the decade by withholding stocks and pursuing an intensive marketing campaign. 

   An advertising and promotion budget which rose to $110 million this year from $43 million in 1980 helped raise world-wide sales of diamond jewelry to a record 49 million pieces valued at $24.6 billion last year. 
In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says. 

   In more than half a century of its existence, the Central Selling Organization, which includes as members black African state producers, has outlasted other commodity cartels by never cutting diamond prices. 

   The cartel controls most of the world's rough diamond market via a "pipeline" that stretches from mines in Africa to Australia to diamond dealers and cutters.

FT  13 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP's Chilean copper mine set
to become world's biggest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another expansion of the Escondida copper mine in Chile is almost certain to
go ahead to boost its annual output to 800,000 tonnes of the metal a year.
This would put it ahead of Chuquicamata, also in Chile, as the world's
biggest copper mine and make Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest
company, which entered the copper business only five years ago, the world's
major producer of traded copper.
Mr John Prescott, chairman of BHP, says he has 'a high degree of confidence'
that the Escondida partners will give the go-ahead for the expansion within
the next few weeks.
The mine, jointly owned by BHP (57.5 per cent), the RTZ Corporation of the
UK (30 per cent), JECO, a consortium of Japanese smelters (10 per cent) and
the International Finance Corporation (2.5 per cent), is still in the throes
of a second-stage expansion, from 320,000 to 480,000 tonnes, scheduled to be
completed by September.
The third-stage expansion would be completed in two years and analysts
suggest the capital investment required would be minimal compared with the
profits generated.
Mr Prescott brushes aside suggestions that Escondida will be contributing to
a glut of copper concentrate (an intermediate material) that will depress
the metal's price at the end of the 1990s. He says Escondida talked to all
its customers before considering the next expansion phase and 'we seem to be
getting a commitment (from them to take) the tonnage we intend to produce'.
In view of this commitment by customers, BHP feels under no pressure to
build its own copper smelter in Chile.
BHP's small Island copper mine in Vancouver, Canada, will run out of ore in
1995-96 and the company has no expansion plans for Ok Tedi, the mine in
Papua New Guinea, in which it had boosted its shareholding recently to a
controlling interest. However, it bid unsuccessfully for the El Abra copper
deposit in Chile and, according to Mr Prescott, 'we are looking at every
opportunity (in copper) that comes up'.
Mr Prescott, in London to talk to customers and investors, says BHP's move
to spread its operations into high-value minerals such as platinum and
diamonds is going smoothly. He expects the Zimbabwe government to give final
approval soon for the Hartley platinum project, which has an initial planned
production rate of 150,000 ounces of platinum and 110,000 ounces of
palladium from mid-1996. BHP's partner is Delta Gold, another Australian
company.
A proposal to link all the platinum operations on the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe
 -where RTZ and the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa also have
projects - has been shelved, however. 'Our mine will be developed,' Mr
Prescott insists. 'It makes sense on its own. It might make more sense if it
was all put together as a joint venture. But it was an idea that did not get
mutual support.'
Although it now looks increasingly likely that BHP may start mining diamonds
in Canada's North West Territories, BHP has still to decide how the gem
rough (uncut) diamonds will be marketed. About 80 per cent of world trade in
such diamonds is controlled by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation but
Canadian companies are forbidden to join cartels. Mr Prescott says: 'We
won't be going into the diamond business without understanding how we will
market them. We have to recognise the (unfavourable) attitude to the CSO in
various parts of the world if we want to deal with them or they want to deal
with us. That is something we will have to address.'
Mr Prescott admits that cuts in contract prices for iron ore, manganese and
coal recently agreed with Japanese customers will have a substantial impact
on BHP's profit but it is working to overcome this.
He says: 'We are a low-cost producer, especially of coal and manganese, and
we can only maintain that position if we continue to invest. I am certainly
concerned about recent trends in long-term prices. But the Japanese are our
most important customers and they must be treated as our most important
customers.'

   DALLAS -- A French diamond-exploration company has filed a
$195 million lawsuit against Sunshine Mining Corp., alleging
breach of contract and failure to perform duties associated
with a joint venture in a diamond mining project in Sierra
Leone.
   The Boulle Group, a partnership based in Troyes, France,
alleges that it began a relationship with the Sierra Leone
government in 1971 and developed a diamond-mining prospect
there. In 1989, the brothers Jean-Raymond and Franco Boulle
signed a joint venture agreement with Sunshine Mining, a
Dallas-based precious metals mining company, to develop the
project.

   In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas, the
Boulles allege that Sunshine officials withheld information,
executed exclusive agreements and misappropriated funds in an
attempt to take the project for themselves, excluding the
Boulles. Sunshine also evicted the Boulles from the joint
venture offices in Dallas, the brothers allege.
   The brothers attempted to work out the problems with
Sunshine to save the venture, said their attorney, Robert C.
Odle Jr. of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in Washington, D.C. But
when that attempt failed, they filed suit, asking the federal
court to either dissolve the disputed joint venture or enjoin
Sunshine from interfering in the project. The Boulles are
also asking for $65 million in actual damages and $130
million in exemplary damages.
   The two parties are still partners in the Arkansas Diamond
Development Co., which has proposed a diamond exploration
project in southwestern Arkansas. That project has been
controversial because it would convert a publicly owned state
park to private use.
   Several officials from Sunshine Mining weren't available
for comment, and others didn't return phone calls.
