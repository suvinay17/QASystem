<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Seize Developer's Land Near Civil War

   A bill authorizing the federal government to
seize more than 500 acres of a developer's land adjacent to a
historic Civil War battlefield was cleared Thursday for House floor
action, possibly next week.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved by
voice vote an almost identical measure to one passed earlier by the
House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee.
   The Public Works version, however, stipulated that $30 million
in Interior Department rather than Transportation Department funds
be used to study whether roads should be closed in the Manassas
National Battlefield Park in the Virginia countryside west of
Washington.
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., an early sponsor of the bill, said
the House may vote on the measure Aug. 10.
   The bill would allow the government to seize 542 acres adjacent
to the park where a developer has proposed a massive shopping
complex, add the tract to the 4,600-acre park, close two roads
running through the battlefield and build new roads around the park.
   Congress became involved in the dispute when Northern Virginia
developer John T. Hazel announced plans to build 1.2 million square
feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office space and
560 homes next to the site of two major Civil War battles.
   Hazel's first proposal for a modest office park development
raised no community concerns, but when Prince William County, Va.,
officials relaxed zoning laws for the parcel, Hazel expanded his
development plans.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
commanded Southern troops in the Second Battle of Manassas.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of Union and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The First Battle of Manassas, fought in July 1861, was the first
significant land battle of the Civil War. A surprising Confederate
victory there convinced Union authorities that the war would be a
protracted affair.
   More than 20,000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the
Second Battle of Manassas, which lasted over three days in August
1862. Most historians agree that Lee's triumph in that battle
represented the Confederacy's greatest victory of the war.

   A Senate national parks subcommittee announced
today a hearing on what has become known as the ``Third Battle of
Manassas,'' the fight by preservationists to prevent construction
of a shopping mall adjacent to a Civil War battlefield in northern
Virginia.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests will meet Sept. 8 to consider
legislation which the House passed 307-98 on Wednesday to buy the
542-acre mall site next to the battlefield where the Confederacy
won two major battles in 1861 and 1862.
   Historians and preservationists say a shopping mall would
desecrate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died on the
battlefield. The House bill would add the land to the existing
battlefield park.
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., said that after testimony is taken
at the hearing, he may offer legislation to buy only a part of the
developer's tract.
   ``My concern continues to be that the federal government could
spend a significant amount of the taxpayers' money for a parcel of
land, which during the debates in 1980, was not regarded as
historically significant for the Park expansion bill,'' said Warner.
   ``If Congress prevents development on this site and purchases
the property, at considerable expense to the federal taxpayer and
the mall is moved to a nearby site and built, is that expenditure
of federal funds justified in order to protect property which has
some historical significance?'' he asked.
   Warner said he believes the tract's Stuart's Hill where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had headquaters during the Second
Battle of Manassas in 1862 should be considered for inclusion in
the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   The Reagan administration opposes the measure because of its
cost _ estimated to range from $15 million to $100 million. Office
of Management and Budget and Interior Department officials have
said they would recommend that President Reagan veto the measure if
Congress enacts it in its current form.
   One of the major floor debates was the cost versus the
preservation of American heritage.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said important pieces of property
representing America's heritage must be preserved.
   ``Our country and our culture are built upon our heritage,'' he
said. ``Our past is an important part of our present, and our
future.''
   However, when the matter came to a vote, Parris voted
``present'' because the developer, John T. Hazel, has been a close
friend and campaign contributor to him for many years.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., called the measure ``a squandering
of the taxpayers' money. This should have a low priority or no
priority.''
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., also opposed the measure, saying:
``This is an extraordinary expenditure when we deny the needy.''
   But Rep. Bruce V. Vento, D-Minn., floor manager for the bill,
said, ``This is about history, about our cultural history that must
be preserved.
   ``It's a matter of whether we preserve our history or turn it
into a dollar,'' he said.
   Hazel purchased the land two years ago for under $10 million. It
is now assessed at $13.6 million. He wants to build 1.2 million
square feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes next to the site of the two major Civil War
battles.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
commanded Southern troops in the Second Battle of Manassas.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of Union and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The First Battle of Manassas, fought in July 1861, was the first

protracted affair.

1862. Most historians agree that Lee's triumph in that battle
represented the Confederacy's greatest victory in the war.

<HEAD>Bill Proposes US Buy Site Near Civil War Battleground to Block
Shopping Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressmen moved Wednesday to protect a
historic Civil War battlefield, introducing legislation for the
federal government to purchase the land next to the battle site in
order to block a planned shopping center.
   The bill, authored by Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., and Michael
Andrews, D-Texas, would direct the Interior Department to purchase
from a developer a 600-acre plot of land adjacent to the Manassas
National Battlefield Park, where two important Civil War battles
were fought.
   The congressmen, who are Civil War buffs, say plans for a 1.2
million square-foot shopping center would violate the battlefield
site.
   ``We've come to this conclusion because both of us feel there's
no other choice,'' said Andrews. ``Both of us are convinced that
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping
mall.''
   The land-purchase bill comes a week after Mrazek attached
language to a House appropriations panel supplemental spending bill
that would block any federal highway money for road improvements
associated with the shopping complex.
   The 3,800-acre Manassas battlefield, about 27 miles west of
Washington, was the site of the first significant land battle of
the Civil War in 1861.
   In a second, three-day battle in 1862, 24,000 Union and
Confederate casualties were recorded, as Union forces that had been
as far south as Richmond 60 days earlier were pushed back into the
nation's capital.
   The battles, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and
in the South as the Battles of Manassas, helped convince Union
officials that the war would be a protracted affair.
   Developers originally sought to build the shopping center on a
plot of land where historians say Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
had his battle headquarters, but have met with opposition from
local preservationists.
   Last Thursday, Hazel-Peterson Companies agreed to move the
complex a short distance away, at the suggestion of Interior
Department and National Park Service officials.
   Mrazek and Andrews rejected that move.
   ``I don't think that compromise is what we're looking for at the
battlefield,'' said Mrazek, who noted that the developer has
upgraded plans for the development several times. ``I don't think
the property ought to be desecrated, and that's what we view it
as.''
   The land-purchase bill will be referred to the House Interior
Committee.
   Rep. French Slaughter, R-Va., whose district includes the
battlefield site, has not yet studied the land-purchase bill, but
would support a move to reroute roads now running through the
battlefield, he said.
   Interior Department officials were unavailable for comment on
the latest proposal.
   In addition to asking the federal government to use its right of
eminent domain to acquire the land, Andrews, a member of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said he will ask his panel to reexamine
tax breaks given to developers building near national park sites.
   ``The question is, are we really going to protect the buffer
zones around national parks,'' Andrews asked. ``This is an
egregious example of where developers have been invited in by the
local politicians.''
   Andrews said he hoped to move the bill out of committee and onto
the House floor by July.

   Preservationists and historians were
celebrating Friday after President Reagan signed legislation that
included a provision to block construction of a shopping mall next
to a Civil War battlefield in northern Virginia.
   ``We are pleased, grateful, elated, you name it,'' said Annie
Snyder, a Civil War buff who organized the movement to stop the
building project adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
``It's a tremendous victory, and we're awfully relieved.''
   The administration had opposed the proposal to purchase a
540-acre parcel adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
because of its projected $60 million-plus cost, but the measure was
attached to a bill that Reagan signed amending the sweeping tax
overhaul enacted in 1986.
   Developer John T. Hazel had planned to build a 1.2
million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes on the site, but preservationists complained the
measure would violate the still-rustic sanctity of the 4,200-acre
park where two crucial Civil War battles were fought.
   Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., Mike Andrews, D-Texas, and Frank
Wolf, R-Va., fashioned a plan that called on the government to
acquire the entire development tract, close two heavily traveled
commuter routes running through the battlefield and pay up to $30
million for construction of new roads around the park. The House
overwhelmingly passed the legislation in July.
   However, Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., rejected less-expensive
compromise measures and sponsored a bill identical to the House
version. After Bumpers succeeded in getting the bill through the
Energy and Natural Resources committee he serves on, the measure was
attached to the tax bill passed by the Senate.
   A key to the movement's success was a groundswell of support from
around the country, including more than 80,000 petition signatures
asking Congress to buy the land, Snyder said.
   ``It's been the most incredible grass-roots effort I've ever
seen,'' Snyder said. ``It shows when the people of the nation get
behind something, there's still a way for the little guy to win.''
   The park, west of Washington, D.C., includes the site of the
First and Second Battles of Manassas, also known as Bull Run after a
creek in the area.
   The proposed development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in a stunning
victory in the Second Manassas. Historians also have testified that
unmarked graves of Union and Confederate soldiers were scattered
throughout the site.

<TEXT>
   More than a century after Union and
Confederate soldiers spilled blood over stretches of land from
Pennsylvania to Virginia, a group is battling developers for the
real estate.
   The Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites was
organized last summer to buy land or development rights of
battlefields unprotected by the National Park Service or other
organizations.
   ``All of us have watched over the past couple of years as a
tremendous amount of historic ground has disappeared,'' said Gary
W. Gallagher, a Penn State University history professor who is
president of the organization.
   ``If something isn't done in the next five years, it'll be too
late,'' he said.
   Gallagher said the organization has 500 members and has raised
more than $10,000. The organization received tax-exempt status last
month and plans to begin soliciting members this spring, he said.
   Urban sprawl from the Civil War capitals of Washington and
Richmond, Va., has engulfed many battlefields and threatens others.
   A large mall has been planned for an important part of the
Manassas battlefield in northern Virginia, where the second battle
of Bull Run was fought.
   Annie Snyder, who lives on a 180-acre farm adjacent to the
battlefield, earlier this year organized a group called Save The
Battlefield Coalition to fight the mall.
   Also, five parcels of land on the Cedar Creek battlefield, near
Winchester, Va., are for sale.
   ``One of the Cedar Creek sites has already been targeted as a
light industrial park, and it will be a light industrial park
unless someone buys that ground before the end of the year,'' he
said.
   Many of the former battlefields are farm or pasture land.
Encroaching development has raised real estate prices and taxes,
according to Gallagher.
   ``It's difficult to go to a land owner who hasn't been able to
make it as a farmer and has just been offered $2 million for his
land. How do you convince that person not to take the $2 million
and run?'' he said.
   Gallagher said the formation of the group was prompted last
summer by a developers who slipped bulldozers onto northern
Virginia's Chantilly Battlefield in the middle of the night.
   Initially, the developers had agreed to delay any excavation
until historical surveying could be conducted, according to
Gallagher. Only five acres were preserved to commemorate the
battle, he said.
   The National Park Service owns and maintains several Civil War
battlefields, including sites in Gettysburg, Antietam, Monassas,
Fredericksburg, Appomatox and Richmond.
   Many others remain unprotected, Gallagher said.
   Among them are sites in the Shenandoah Valley, where Confederate
General Stonewall Jackson staged his 1862 campaign, and at Brandy
Station, in north-central Virginia, the site of the largest cavalry
battle in the Western Hemisphere, Gallagher said.
   Gallagher said the organization plans to buy land or development
rights and turn the property over to historical societies or
government organizations to manage.
   ``We're not talking about buying thousands and thousands of
acres. We know some growth is inevitable. We just think there has
to be some balance between growth and preserving a part of our
past,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressmen Striving To Block Federal Money For Shopping Center</HEAD>

   Three congressmen said Thursday they are
striving to block federal highway money for a shopping center to be
built adjacent to a major Civil War battlefield in northern
Virginia.
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., has introduced language into a
supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit federal
highway money from being used for road improvements near the
Manassas National Battlefield Park, 30 miles west of Washington.
   Developers plan to build a 1.2 million square-foot shopping mall
adjacent to the battlefield.
   Mrazek and other self-proclaimed Civil War buffs in Congress
said the project will violate the sanctity of the battlefield.
   ``The battlefield that helped shape the America we know today
should not be the sight of a Taco Bell or a Mattressland,'' said
Mrazek. ``We should not be building on top of a lot of Union and
Confederate soldiers who still lie today where they fell in
battle.''
   The battlefield is where two significant Civil War clashes were
fought, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and called
the Battles of Manassas in the South.
   The first battle, fought on July 21, 1861, was the initial major
confrontation of the Civil War, and a surprising Confederate
victory helped convince Union officials that the war would be a
prolonged effort.
   The second battle, a bloody affair Aug. 29-30, 1862 that saw
24,000 casualties, was a costly victory for Confederate forces.
Union forces that had been as far south as Richmond two months
earlier were driven back into the nation's capital.
   Supporters of the development plan claim that the project will
not violate the battlefield, but Mrazek and Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, said the project will be built on the spot where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had his headquarters for the second
battle.
   Mrazek's amendment, passed by the House Appropriations
transportation subcommittee, would block use of federal money for
highway projects needed to improve access to the rural battleground.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said Mrazek's plan is a stop-gap
measure intended to allow the Interior Department to use money from
a special fund to purchase and protect the 600-acre land parcel.
   ``The Congress is certainly acting in the national interest, so
that this hallowed land can be saved,'' said Vento, who chairs an
Interior and Insular Affairs panel that deals with national
parklands. ``This is an awkward but necessary move.''

   The battle lines are drawn again at Antietam,
the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of the Civil War, as
preservationists seek to protect the area from encroaching
development. This time neighbor is pitted against neighbor with the
National Park Service in the middle, a scenario that's also being
played out at other historic sites around the country.

   Once again, Millard Kefauver's 280-acre
dairy farm is in the line of fire.
   Kefauver's great-grandfather farmed the same land when Union and
Confederate soldiers surged across the rolling western Maryland
landscape on Sept. 17, 1862, in the bloodiest single day of
fighting of the Civil War.
   Now Kefauver and his family are swept up in a struggle over
efforts to protect the Antietam National Battlefield Park from
encroaching development.
   It is typical of many struggles being fought out as the great
cities of America extend their suburbs into the once-quiet
countryside.
   ``Battles were fought near areas that had strategic importance
then and, since they had strategic importance then, they would have
growth potential now,'' says Edwin Bearss, chief historian of the
National Park Service and a specialist on the Civil War.
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation says Cedar Creek
Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation at Middletown, Va., where
Union General Phil Sheridan handed the Confederacy one of its final
stunning blows by winning control of the Shenandoah Valley in 1864,
could be surrounded by eight 10-acre industrial parks.
   In 1988, Congress authorized acquisition of Stuart's Hill at
Manassas, Va., stopping plans for a 1.2 million-square-foot
shopping mall on land where the Blue and the Gray fought two
crucial battles. Just last year, Congress stepped in again and
approved expansion of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National
Military Park in Virginia.
   It is not just Civil War battlefields that are threatened,
preservationists say. The National Trust has a list of what it
calls the 11 most endangered historic places, including sites
associated with Columbus' landing in the Virgin Islands, the
rivalry of Spain and England for control of the Georgia and South
Carolina coasts early in the 18th century, and 19th century gold
and silver strikes in South Dakota.
   Preservationists are far from united on how to deal with the
situation.
   ``One view is that the only way to protect a park and the only
way to be truly fair to landowners is to have the federal
government purchase the property,'' says Bruce Craig of the
National Parks and Conservation Association.
   That approach got a boost as long ago as the 1890s, when
Congress established Gettysburg National Military Park in
Pennsylvania, blocking Gettysburg Electric Railway Co. from
building a development around Big Round Top, a vital point of
ground in the engagement that marked the high-water mark of
Confederate fortunes.
   The railroad sued, saying Congress didn't have the power to
acquire land for commemorative purposes. The Supreme Court, in a
unanimous opinion in 1896, replied, ``Such a use seems ... not only
a public use, but one so closely connected with the welfare of the
Republic itself as to be within the powers granted the Congress by
the Constitution for the purpose of protecting and preserving the
whole country.''
   The trouble is that protecting and preserving the whole country
can be costly.
   In the Manassas case, for example, the purchase price was left
to future negotiation, and hasn't been settled yet.
   ``What the lands will ultimately cost the taxpayer no one
knows,'' says Bearss, the Park Service historian.
   In addition, says Craig of the Parks and Conservation
Association, ``There is sometimes a community hesitation and a
suspicion of what the federal government is likely to do with that
property.''
   There sure is.
   ``I can never be satisfied with anything the Park Service
does,'' says Russell Weaver of Sharpsburg, president of Save
Historic Antietam with Responsible Policies (SHARP), one of two
rival citizens' groups that have sprung up around the battlefield.
   Tom Clemens, president of the Save Historic Antietam Foundation
(SHAF), says, ``There are still people in Sharpsburg who would just
like the whole battlefield and the National Park Service to go
away, and that isn't going to happen.''
   The latest fracas was touched off in 1985 when the zoning
commission approved a rezoning that paved the way for construction,
expected soon, of a shopping center next door to the privately
owned Grove Farm, where President Abraham Lincoln met with Union
Gen. George B. McClellan after the battle in which the forces of
McClellan and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee fought to a virtual
draw and left 23,000 killed, wounded or missing. It will be the
first shopping center in this town of 800, which now has not a
single fast-food franchise.

   House members on Tuesday vowed to increase
efforts to prevent construction of a massive shopping center
adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   ``We're really a case of last resort here,'' Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, told a House panel. ``We're either going to save the
battlefield, or let a developer literally put one of the nation's
biggest shopping malls right next door.''
   ``I'm interested in coming up with a policy for these matters,''
said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who chairs the Interior and Insular
Affairs subcommittee on national parks and public lands. ``The
preservation of resources is a priority of the National Park
Service.''
   Congress became involved in the development dispute after local
opponents of the project charged that government officials and
builders in Prince William County, Va., tricked them by first
proposing a small office park and then switching to a 1.2 million
square foot mall.
   The battlefield, located 27 miles west of Washington, D.C., was
the site of the first significant land battle of the Civil War. A
surprising Confederate triumph in that 1861 fight helped convince
Union leaders that the war would be a protracted affair.
   The second battle, fought over a three-day span in August 1862,
saw a bloody, decisive Confederate victory that set the stage for
Rebel attacks on the North.
   The present fight centers around a 542-acre tract adjacent to
the federally run park where developers first proposed building the
mall. They agreed to move the mall some 600 feet after historians
noted that a hill in the middle of the disputed land was the site
from which Gen. Robert E. Lee directed Confederate forces in the
second Battle of Manassas.
   That single concession, however, has not satisfied opponents,
who charge that the construction of a mall that large will forever
destroy the sanctity of the still-rural area where 20,000
casualties were recorded in the second contest.
   Andrews and Rep Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., have introduced
legislation that would direct the Interior Department to purchase
the disputed tract and add it to the park, while Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., has proposed that Congress buy the land directly, a faster
move than waiting up to 10 years for the federal agency to act.
Both measures would also close roads now running through the
battlefields.
   Wolf also wants the federal government to pay for construction
of new highways around the 4,600-acre battlefield park, which
Virginia state highway officials say would cost $101 million.

<HL> A Big Shopping Mall Is Setting Its Sights On a Civil War Site --- Staging Area for the Battles Of Bull Run Is Overrun With Builders' Bulldozers </HL>

   "Charge!" could take on a whole new meaning at this Civil War battle site. 

   Pasture land where Robert E. Lee sent his musket-bearing troops to their greatest victory against the North 126 years ago may soon be overrun by invaders wielding MasterCards. 
Developers, you see, plan to build a shopping mall on this hallowed ground. 

   The thought of five big department stores and dozens of specialty shops plunked down on land where boys in blue and gray spilled their blood has sparked a new Battle of Manassas. 
"This is plainly a battle between greed and heritage," says Anne Snyder, a red-haired, 66-year-old former Marine known locally as "Stonewall Annie." 
She has marshaled a group of rebels who include historians, congressmen, Carter administration luminaries (Jody Powell and Zbigniew Brzezinski), and Charlton Heston. 
Their battle cry: "Stonewall the Mall." 

   But even as the issue of slavery split the Union in 1861, shopping malls are divisive in these parts. 
Prince William County officials welcome the mall as a contribution to the tax base. 
The developers say that what they do on private land won't violate the neighboring Manassas National Battlefield Park. 
And supporters say that sacred ground is in the eye of the consumer: "All in all, I prefer shopping malls," explained Virginian William Heyman in a letter to the Washington Post. 
"Battlefields glorify death. 
Shopping malls celebrate life." 

   The mall-fighters have already won one skirmish. 
To make way for the 1.2 million-square-foot mall, developers had planned to level Stuart's Hill, where Gen. Lee set up his headquarters in 1862 for the second Battle of Manassas. 

   A National Park Service official likens that to putting "a roller derby around the Sistine Chapel." 
In the 1861 and 1862 Civil War battles fought at Manassas -- and known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run -- the underdog South sent the Union fleeing back toward Washington, 26 miles away. 

   Now the mall developers have retreated somewhat themselves, offering to move their planned colossus to lower ground so as to make it less visible from the national park. 
They would still pave over much of the ridge for office buildings and parking spaces, but they would leave a few acres intact to commemorate Gen. Lee's 30 hours on the summit. 
The mall, along with associated new homes and town houses, would then be spread in the historical staging area where half of Lee's army waited for battle, took care of the wounded at two field hospitals and planted their dead in temporary graves. 
About 155 men are said to have died in skirmishes on the tract. 

   Like Gen. Lee, Mrs. Snyder and her citizen volunteers are in danger of winning a battle but losing the war. 
Hazel/Peterson Cos., the developer, owns the 540 acres of private land next to the national park and has already won zoning approval to build the mall. 
The developers include a powerful Yankee, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Ohio, the nation's biggest builder of shopping centers. 

   The developers defend their right to make use of the land they own. 
In any event, "Its historical importance is debatable," says Robert Kelly, Hazel/Peterson's spokesman. 
Most of the local Civil War fighting, he says, took place on land well within the national park, and the federal government had turned down chances to buy the tract where the mall is to be. 
"This is one of the hottest real-estate markets in the country," he says, "and now there are higher and better uses for the land." 

   Preservationists say Manassas is just one of many national-park sites endangered by encroaching development. 
They worry about the Florida Everglades, whose delicate water system is threatened by the growth of Dade County. 
They fret because in the vicinity of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana a religious sect called the Church Universal and Triumphant has set up trailers and fences in a private valley and wants to tap into the geothermal energy that feeds Yellowstone's geysers. 
And someday, in the isolated Montana park at Little Big Horn, some ice-cream vendor might not be able to resist the temptation to build his own Custard's Last Stand on a 2.5-mile, privately owned strip that cuts across federal parkland there. 

   But historic preservationists' blood seems to run hottest over Civil War sites. 
And they are taking a definite stand in Manassas, where Confederate Gen. Thomas J. Jackson became known as "Stonewall" at the first Battle of Manassas. 

   "Once it's gone, it will never be back again," says Mr. Powell, the former White House press secretary, speaking of the historic, albeit private, property: "It's easy to bulldoze the trees and push down the hill, but you can be damned sure you're never going to bulldoze the office building and dig up the parking lots." 
Mr. Powell, a Georgian, counts nine ancestors who fought at Manassas. 

   The anti-mall forces threw a dinner dance to raise money, and they plan an apple-pie bake sale to help pay a lawyer to challenge in court the constuction project's zoning. 
A local songwriter donated a battle hymn of his own composition in which he imagines seeing his mythical grandfather fall where they now want to build the mall. 

   Mr. Powell, who heads the Washington office of ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, has donated public-relations services. 
A coalition of national perservation groups has rallied to the cause. 
Democratic Reps. 
Robert Mrazek of New York and Michael Andrews of Texas have proposed bills in the House to block the mall and buy the land for the 3,800-acre park. 
Republican Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia has proposed to have the government acquire the land immediately. 

   If the developers hadn't suddenly changed their plans in January, the current battle might never have occurred. 
The National Park Service and historic preservationists had reluctantly acquiesced in a zoning change to allow a campus-like office -- housing development on the rural tract. 
Then, however, the developers announced that they were taking on DeBartolo Corp. as a partner, and planned to construct one of the largest shopping malls in the Washington, D.C., area. 

   The Interior Department, which oversees the park service, has since tried to be a peacemaker in the Manassas fray, proposing to allow the mall while at the same time closing two busy roads that bisect the park. 
But the preservationists weren't mollified. 

   "It's not just the traffic problem that a mall would bring," complains Elizabeth Connelly, a 33-year-old mother of four who is one of Mrs. Snyder's volunteers. 
"It's everything else that comes with the mall, like fast-food restaurants and gas stations." 

   While all the talking is going on, developers' bulldozers already are clearing land for a road and new housing. 
Some preservationists worry that suburbanization here may also be unstoppable. 
The road from Manassas to the nation's capital these days is an interstate highway. 
And Gen. Lee never had to cross swords with a zoning lawyer.

   Federal money cannot be used to construct
roads for a shopping center being built adjacent to a historic
Civil War battlefield, lawmakers agreed Friday.
   Members of a House and Senate conference committee adopted a
measure introduced by Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that prohibits
federal funds from being used for the planning, design, or approval
of an interchange near the proposed William Center development,
about 27 miles west of the nation's capital.
   The conference committee is seeking to reconcile House and
Senate versions of a $10.8 billion transportation appropriations
bill.
   The measure, which was included the appropriations bill, will
expire in two years, but Mrazek said it could be renewed if a
dispute between the shopping center developer and preservationists
is not resolved by then.
   ``The result today makes it manifestly clear that the Congress
does not want to assist in the development of this land,'' said
Mrazek, who predicted that a ``substantial amount'' of the
development tract would ultimately be saved.
   The 542-acre development is adjacent to the Manassas National
Battlefield Park, site of two crucial Civil War battles.
   Historians argue that the project, which would include a 1.2
million square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of
office space and 560 homes, would destroy the rustic sanctity of
the 4,200-acre park.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., is preparing legislation that would
seize a section of the site and direct the developer, John T.
Hazel, to eliminate the shopping mall from his plans and greatly
reduce the amount of office space.
   Warner's plan would add to the park a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops during the
Second Battle of Manassas. Historians and preservationists argue
that this parcel is the most significant in the entire development
tract.
   Transporation officials have estimated that the interchange
would cost up to $50 million.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes To Acquire Site Near Civil War Battlefield</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel on Thursday voted to seize a
development site adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
in suburban Virginia, rejecting a compromise under which only part
of the parcel would be acquired.
   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 11-8 to approve
a measure that would authorize Congress to acquire the 542-acre
William Center Development tract, close two heavily-traveled
commuter routes through the Civil War battlefield and pay up to $30
million to build new roads around the park.
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., is
identical to a bill that passed the House last month.
   It prevailed over a compromise measure by Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., that would have acquired just 80 acres of the tract. Warner
said his proposal would preserve the most important historical
aspects of the site at a lower cost.
   However, Bumpers maintained the entire tract was historically
significant.
   ``If we don't act to preserve that property, you can go down
there three weeks from now, and it will be gone, for all intents
and purposes,'' Bumpers said. ``It'll be a shopping mall.''
   Committe chairman Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said he hoped
the bill would reach the Senate floor by next week. President
Reagan has threatened to veto any legislation similar to the
Bumpers bill.
   Developer John T. Hazel is planning to build a 1.2 million
square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of office space,
and 560 homes adjacent to the 4,200-acre park.
   Historians claim the development would ruin the historic
integrity of the still-rustic ground on which the First and Second
Battles of Manassas were fought.
   In addition, the development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in Second
Manassas. Historians also claim that Union and Confederate dead lie
in unmarked graves scattered throughout the development area.

   A third battle of Manassas is brewing, this
one over a shopping center complex being built near where the Union
and Rebel forces clashed in 1861 and again in 1862.
   Neither the outrage of preservationists, the pleas of Civil War
buffs nor 166 signatures on congressional legislation has been able
to stop bulldozers from plowing ground on the project.
   Construction crews already have begun to lay access roads and
prepare the property for sewers. They expect to start construction
on the first section of 560 townhouses and detached homes in 60
days.
   The developers say the section is not part of the land
considered sacred by historians. But local preservationists argue
that even if the hill from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
directed troops has not yet been touched, the excavation work
should stop until Congress has had time to act.
   The National Manassas Battlefield, about 30 miles from
Washington, is cherished for its bucolic surroundings where
visitors can easily imagine what Civil War troops saw in 1861 and
1862 during two of the South's important victories _ the battles of
Manassas, or as Northerners say, the battles of Bull Run.
   But the Washington metropolitan area is one of the nation's
fastest growing regions, and any land around the 4,500-acre
historic park not owned by the government is vulnerable to
surburban sprawl.
   As for the 600 acres adjacent to the park where Lee's troops
gathered and battlefield hospitals were located, Hazel-Peterson Co.
plans to go ahead with construction unless stopped by Congress,
said Robert C. Kelly, spokesman for the firm, the most prominent
development company in northern Virginia.
   A few weeks ago, Reps. Robert Mzarek, D-N.Y., and Michael
Andrews, D-Texas, started action to stop construction by
introducing a bill that would have the interior secretary take
possession of the land for park expansion.
   It quickly got the approval of at least 166 members of the House
who signed on as co-sponsors, but did not win over the three
congressmen whose districts comprise northern Virginia. All are
Republicans and all are well-acquainted with the wealthy Hazel
family and its involvement in local GOP politics.
   In fact, not one of Virginia's 10 members of Congress had signed
on in support of the Mzarek-Andrews bill or entered into the debate
in any way.
   Last week, that changed and suddenly there was new hope for
historians that the bulldozers would be idled.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., whose district is near the battlefield,
introduced a bill that would enable the government to acquire the
land through ``legislative taking,'' a process that is faster than
that proposed by Mzarek and Andrews. Wolf's bill also provides for
highway construction to relieve traffic congestion threatening the
park.
   Mzarek and Andrews quickly gave their support for the plan, and
immediately signing on as a co-sponsor was Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va.,
a longtime friend and partner in some business ventures with John
``Til'' Hazel, who runs Hazel-Peterson Co.
   Supporting development are county officials who anticipate
increased tax revenues.
   ``We are pleased and happy the project is being built,'' said
Robert Noe, Prince William County executive before Wolf introduced
his bill. ``The greatest hope for stability in the tax base is
economic development and a regional mall is the catalyst for the
kind of economic development communities need.''
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel also has opposed congressional
intervention, saying the land would cost the government too much.
   Hazel-Peterson spokesman Kelly said his firm bought the land for
between $10 million and $12 million. Hodel said it probably would
cost the government $70 million to acquire it.
   ``Not only is the cost high, but it will not solve the problem,
since the proposed mall could simply move further down the road,
either imposing a traffic burden on the park or requiring that land
also to be purchased,'' said Hodel in a letter to Rep. Morris
Udall, D-Ariz., chairman of the House Interior Committee.
   ``Development is going to occur all around the battlefield
whether it is us or someone else,'' said Kelly. ``This land is not
for sale. We don't want it taken and we are proceeding with
construction.''

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Seizure of Land Planned for Battlefield Shopping
Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee on Thursday approved a
bill to seize land that was to be used for a disputed shopping
center adjacent to a Civil War battlefield near the nation's
capital.
   The Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee on national parks
and public lands acted to take control of a 542-acre tract
bordering the Manassas National Battlefield Park, the site of two
major Civil War battles.
   A developer has planned a massive shopping, residential and
office complex next to the 4,600-acre battlefield park located in
Prince William County, Va., 27 miles west of Washington. But
historians and local groups have claimed the development would
destroy the still-rustic sanctity of the park.
   ``This is a remedy the Congress, and the American people, have
available,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the panel.
``I don't see any other alternative to dealing with this problem.''
   The bill, which combines prior measures proposed by Reps. Robert
Mrazek, D-N.Y., and Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and a separate
proposal by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., also would close U.S. 29 and
state route 234, which run through the park, and provide up to $30
million for the construction of new roads around the site. The
federal government also would pay the site's developer, the
Hazel-Peterson Cos., for the land that was seized.
   The land was sold to developer John T. Hazel for an estimated
$12 million in 1985. Land experts estimate repurchasing the land
and paying for road closings could cost the government up to $150
million.
   ``We will eventually pay probably three times what we have spent
in the past year on acquisitions for national parks,'' said Rep.
Ron Marlenee, R-Mont. ``Oh, for the shame of taxpayer abuse we have
in this legislation.''
   He said the roads in the park should be closed, but the
development plans should be allowed to proceed.
   The bill now moves to the full Interior committee, which is
chaired by Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz.
   On Wednesday, the House passed a transportation bill that
included an amendment offered by Mrazek that would prevent federal
involvement in the costly construction of bypasses or access roads
associated with the development.
   Hazel plans to build a complex featuring 1.2 million square-feet
of retail space, 1.7 million square-feet of office space and 560
homes.
   The development site is next to the area in which the First and
Second Battles of Manassas were fought.

<P>
One after another, the Civil War battles that determined America's future are 
being refought, with money and political influence instead of muskets and 
cannon. As Washington, Richmond and other cities in the theater of that war 
sprawl outward, development pressure is intense. Multimillions are at stake. So 
is the heart of American history. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, up the road at Manassas, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan announced a 
federal program to resist commercial intrusion on these battlefields. Earlier, 
Congress stepped in to buy threatened land there for more than $100 million. As 
Lujan said, that is "the worst way to do it . . . We don't have enough money 
just to go off and buy all these sites." 
</P>
<P>
He named 25 Civil War battlefields where the National Park Service wants to 
help stave off development. Among them is this one, Brandy Station, not a clash 
on the scale of Manassas but a tactical turning point in the war because here 
the Federal cavalry finally fought a large-scale stand-up battle against the 
vaunted Jeb Stuart and got away with its pride intact. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of more than 5,000 acres of the battlefield site has applied to build 
an industrial park and housing complex. If local officials approve the 
development, there is no way the government can buy the whole battle site as a 
national shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's idea is to spread around a mere $15 million as seed money to encourage 
private preservation efforts. He cites the Richard K. Mellon Foundation's 
donation of 10 important parcels to the park service through the Conservation 
Fund as an example of what he hopes will follow. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one park service historian bemoans "the visionary notion that 
partnership can cure all the ills of the modern world." Considering the stakes, 
the most an ambitious developer is likely to volunteer in the way of 
battlefield preservation is a plaque noting that so many thousand Americans 
died in a battle fought beneath the pavement of his latest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan wants to encourage zoning, easements, land-banking and historic 
designations. He would help publicize threatened projects. His department will 
start a national Civil War commission as a clearing house, which would support 
state commissions and battlefield studies. 
</P>
<P>
Only an ingrate would see this as a low-cost public relations gesture, empty of 
substantive meaning in the big-money world of zoning and development.

<HEAD>Fight Brewing Over Harpers Ferry Battlefield</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new battle is brewing at the site
of one of the South's greatest victories in the Civil War, this
time pitting federal historians trying to preserve the battlefield
against local officials who want to make the land available for
commercial development.
   The conflict centers on the battlefield where Gen. Stonewall
Jackson led 14,000 Confederate troops in a three-day siege in 1862,
eventually forcing the 12,500-man Union army to give up, the
North's largest surrender of the war.
   The battleground's location along a highway just outside Harpers
Ferry National Historical Park makes it ideal for development.
Harpers Ferry is at the easternmost tip of West Virginia, just an
hour's drive from the Washington metropolitan area and its booming
real estate market.
   National Park Service officials, however, want to preserve it as
it was during the Civil War.
   ``It all happened right there,'' said Donald Campbell, Harpers
Ferry national park supervisor. ``It's a highly significant piece
of American history _ it's certainly the most important battlefield
in the state of West Virginia.
   ``It's just inappropriate to go in there and start digging with
bulldozers. Young soldiers fought and died for their country on
that land.''
   The Jefferson County Commission, however, recently zoned the
privately owned land for high-density housing. Commission President
Garland Moore said the panel didn't see any reason to hold back the
land.
   ``The federal and the state governments own a large hunk of
Jefferson County already,'' Moore said. ``You can't keep taking
land off the tax books and expect to survive.
   ``There was a lot of Civil War activity in Jefferson County. If
we set aside every piece of land in Jefferson County that Civil War
troops fought on, we wouldn't have anything left.''
   The park service can't control what is done with land outside
its jurisdiction and therefore must appeal to the county and state
governments to fight development, Campbell said.
   ``Preserving anything is up to the people,'' Campbell said. ``If
the people want it preserved, history will be preserved. If they
don't, history will be lost. We can only raise the issue.''
   The dispute at Harpers Ferry is not the only battle over
development at a Civil War site around Washington. Plans to
construct a shopping mall outside the Manassas Battlefield National
Park in northern Virginia, site of two important battles, have
drawn strong opposition.
   Moore said the commission's zoning ruling on the Harpers Ferry
site is not necessarily permanent. ``We're certainly willing to
listen,'' he said.
   The park service and the Harpers Ferry town government already
have enacted easements sharply restricting construction in sight of
the historic town, where abolitionist John Brown conducted his
infamous raid in 1859 when West Virginia was still part of
Virginia. The town, much of it preserved in pre-Civil War
condition, is one of the state's top tourist attractions.
   ``We adopted the plan to restrict ourselves,'' said Harpers
Ferry Mayor Bill Brawley. ``The mass majority of the people like
what we have _ we don't want townhouses or apartment houses in the
town.''
   But Brawley said attempts to build in the area surrounding the
park have provoked ``a continuing battle'' between local government
and the park service.
   ``They don't want any development anywhere,'' Brawley said.

   The federal government will ask private groups
and state and local governments to cooperate in preserving the
nation's historic battlefields, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
said Friday.
   The ``American Battlefield Protection Plan'' eventually will
cover all wars fought on U.S. soil, but will begin by focusing on
25 key Civil War sites, Lujan said.
   Because the government can't afford to buy all the land
involved, he said, a cooperative effort is needed to make sure the
farms and fields where Union and Confederate soldiers fought aren't
overwhelmed by shopping malls and industrial parks.
   ``We want the governors, local governments, foundations,
corporations and owners to all join,'' Lujan said in an interview
on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``Some of the battlefields, for example, would be purchased, but
some of them can be commemorated simply by easements, some of them
maybe the owner would want us to put a plaque there commemorating
that particular battle,'' he said. ``We don't have enough money
just to go off and buy all these sites.''
   Details of his plan, which includes a request for $15 million in
seed money, will be explained Saturday when Lujan speaks at
Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia in ceremonies
marking the 129th anniversary of the First Battle of Bull Run.
   Lujan said he also planned to discuss his ideas with the
governors of the states where the sites to be protected are located.
   Florence Kennedy, director of the battlefield preservation drive
for the private Conservation Fund, praised Lujan's project.
   ``I think the secretary's initiative is a very important one
because it's placing great importance on partnership,'' she said in
an interview. ``This partnership cooperation will be a catalyst to
encourage private sector cooperation.''
   A bitter fight broke out in 1988 over a developer's plans to
build a mall on land adjacent to the Manassas park. Congress later
voted to add the disputed tract to the park, with a final cost
expected to exceed $100 million.
   ``I was in the Congress when we went through the Manassas
fight,'' said Lujan, who represented a New Mexico district in the
House of Representatives for 20 years.
   ``At that time I thought it was the worst way to do it. It's
more expensive, you have to file suits. If we have a planned
program, everything works much better,'' he said.
   As an example of the better way, Lujan cited the Richard King
Mellon Foundation's donation to the federal government three weeks
ago of 10 parcels of land, including important sites from the Civil
War battles of Antietem and Gettysburg.
   Lujan's plan has four parts:
   _Encouraging ``creative public and private land-use tools'' such
as zoning, easements, land-banking and historic district
designation to protect imminently threatened sites.
   _Distribute information on public and private projects to
protect battlefields.
   _Use limited federal funds to encourage land purchases by
private conservation organizations and other public agencies.
   _Develop a national strategy to protect other significant
battlefield sites that aren't imminently threatened, but may be in
the future.

<HEAD>Group Says 175 Parks Threatened by Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A new coalition of preservationists says
national parks across the country face threats from commercial
development similar to a plan by a Virginia company to build a
shopping mall next to the Manassas National Battlefield.
   ``At 175 parks, the threat is so significant that the reason the
park was established may be lost,'' Paul Pritchard, one of the
founders of the National Heritage Coalition, said Thursday.
   Pritchard said other endangered parks include Richmond and
Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania in Virginia; Gettysburg, Pa.; the
Everglades National Park in Florida; and Olympic National Park in
Washington.
   At a press conference, Pritchard and other opponents of the
Manassas shopping mall announced their intention to stop it and any
other project that endangers a historic site.
   President Carter's former press secretary, Jody Powell, is
helping the group free of charge with public relations and
organized the gathering.
   The coalition _ sponsored by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation and the National Parks and Conservation Association _
is calling for Congress to enact legislation giving the federal
government power to halt development temporarily so that
negotiation, compromise or federal acquisition of disputed property
can take place.
   As part of its project to protect the Manassas battlefield, the
coalition is working for passage of a bill recently introduced by
Reps. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that
directs the Interior Secretary to acquire the land now owned by
developers.
   Meanwhile, bulldozing is under way to prepare for townhouses and
detached homes that will accompany the shopping mall. Bob Kelly,
spokesman for the developer, Hazel-Peterson Co., said nothing can
stop construction short of an act of Congress.
   The acreage in question includes the site where Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee directed troops for the second battle of Manassas and
includes land used for hospital space and as a burial ground for
some of the war dead.
   Though the land has been part of a master plan for expanding the
4,500-acre park since 1935, it never was acquired by the federal
government and Hazel-Peterson bought it about three years ago for
$10 million.
   The Interior Department is promoting a compromise in which the
developer would move the mall so it is not visible from the park.
   The plan is acceptable to Hazel-Peterson, but not the
preservationists who say even the mall still will generate so much
traffic that visitors won't be able to get to the park without
massive traffic jams.
   Fifteen organizations, including the American Association of
Museums, the American Association of State and Local History, the
Council on America's Military Past, the National Center for
Preservation Law, the Society of Civil War Historians and the
Wilderness Society, are included in the National Heritage Coalition.

   The House on Wednesday approved a measure
prohibiting federal involvement in road projects for a disputed
shopping center scheduled to be built next to a Civil War
battlefield in northern Virginia.
   The provision, included in a $10.8 billion transportation bill
approved by the House, prevents federal money from being used for
the planning, design or construction of bypasses or access roads
associated with the William Center development just west of
Washington in Prince William County, Va.
   The development is being opposed by local groups who say it
would be detrimental to the adjacent Manassas National Battlefield
Park.
   ``This is designed to indicate Congress' interest in this piece
of land,'' said Tad Boggs, an aide to Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.,
who sponsored the provision. ``This is a shot across the
developer's bow, and is intended to buy us time until we come up
with a plan to purchase the land.''
   The bill is the first piece of legislation passed by the House
that attempts to stop the 542-acre development, which historians
claim would violate the sanctity of the 4,600-acre park where two
major Civil War battles were fought.
   The project's developers have offered to help pay for road
construction, but federal funds usually are needed for a project of
this size to be completed. Mrazek's provision prohibits federal
involvement in road bypasses or alterations associated with
Interstate 66, which runs adjacent to the park, and U.S. 29 and
state route 234, which run through the battle site.
   The project, proposed by the Hazel-Peterson Cos., would feature
a 1.2 million-square-foot shopping center, 1.7 million-square-feet
of office space and 560 homes. John T. Hazel, president of the
development group, first proposed a much smaller office park for
the space, but upgraded his plans once county officials relaxed
zoning requirements for the tract.
   Mrazek is a co-sponsor of another House bill that would take
control of the development tract and add it to the boundaries of
the park. That measure is scheduled to be voted on by a House
Interior and Insular Affairs panel Thursday.

<HEAD>Indians Urge Monument to Warriors Who Fell at Little Big Horn in
Montana</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf: ``A memorial,'' to RESTORE dropped words
``would cost about''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indian leaders urged Congress on
Tuesday to approve a memorial to the warriors who fell at Little
Big Horn while Virginia officials urged a national commission to
help preserve Civil War battlefields.
   ``We need to honor our warriors who gave their lives,'' Carol
Gipp of the National Congress of American Indians told the House
Interior Committee's subcommittee on national parks and public
lands.
   The appeal came as Indians, conservationists and others crowded
the hearing room to plead for approval of favorite bills before
Congress adjourns next month.
   A memorial to the warriors who fell in the 1876 victory of the
Sioux over Lt. Col. George Custer and a detachment of the 7th
Cavalry Regiment would cost about $2.1 million, the National Park
Service has estimated. The service is supporting the memorial, as
yet undesigned.
   The memorial would be adjacent to the monument to the 7th
Cavalry which was erected on Last Stand Hill on the Montana
battlefield in 1881. It bears the full names of Custer and each of
the 224 other men in his command.
   Custer was a temporary general with the Union Army during the
Civil War but reverted to lieutenant colonel afterward, the rank he
held in 1876.
   Susan Shown-Harjo, president of the Morning Star Foundation
representing the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, said the names of the
cavalry troopers on the monument has given them ``dignity in
death.''
   ``Our people who died there are referred to as hordes of Indians
along with the cavalry who are named,'' she said.
   The number of Indian dead is unknown, but the National Park
Service says no more than 100 are believed to have been killed in
the battle.
   Virginia officials and historic preservationists urged approval
of a national commission on civil war battlefields to help shield a
number of sites from development as the suburbs outside the
nation's capital spread southward.
   Mayor Elizabeth G. Helm of Winchester pointed to estimates that
employment in the Dulles Corridor outside Washington would grow
more than 1,000 percent and the homes of those joining the labor
force most likely would be in central Maryland and the northern
Shenandoah Valley.
   ``This same area is heavily steeped in history and tradition but
we have tended to take this heritage for granted,'' she said. ``We
have assumed that it will always be with us for future
generations.''
   ``Our ancestors provided beautifully for large and splendid
Confederate and national cemeteries but no one anticipated the
growth that has obliterated many of the battlefields,'' she added.
   Also urging action were Reps. Jim Olin, D-Va., and D. French
Slaughter Jr., R-Va., as well as historic preservationists who are
urging quick action by the government before suburban sprawl
gobbles up battlefields.
   Dr. James Gardner, deputy director of the American Historical
Association, however, opposed the plan. If approved, he said,
``greater and greater amounts of money will be pushed into this
aspect of our history to the exclusion of others.''
   He said preservationists ``should not be so preoccupied with
Civil War battlefields.''
   ``We need to pull back from this Civil War focus and take a
broader view of American history,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Says No U.S. Protest Filed Over Rifle Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional report says the United States
never lodged an official protest with South Korea over evidence
that American-designed rifles built in Korea have been sold to
foreign countries in violation of a U.S.-Korean agreement.
   The General Accounting Office found there was little oversight
of the program and confusion over which government agency should be
in charge of the 1971 pact, which banned sales of the M-16 rifles
to foreign nations without U.S. permission and placed a cap on the
number South Korea could produce.
   ``Defense and State Department officials in various agencies and
locations told us that they were not responsible for managing the
program,'' said the report, which was obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press.
   When presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales, the State
Department usually instructed embassy officials to remind Korea of
the ``seriousness'' of such sales. A strong, official government
protest was never lodged, GAO said.
   The agreement included Colt Industries Firearms Division of
Hartford, Conn., which set up the Korean rifle plant in exchange
for per-weapon royalties.

<TEXT>
   The average full professor at an American
college or university now earns $47,400, according to the American
Association of University Professors.
   The faculty group said Wednesday that its survey of 300,000
professors on 1,900 campuses showed salaries rose by 4.9 percent in
1987-88, compared to a 5.9 percent increase the year before.
   Across all faculty ranks _ including associate professors,
assistant professors, lecturers and instructors _ the average
salary was $37,000.
   The association, which conducts collective bargaining on some
campuses, said that after inflation, faculty salaries rose by just
0.9 percent.
   The association said faculty salaries vary widely by region,
with full professors averaging $52,510 on the West Coast and
Hawaii, and less than $42,000 in some Southern and Central states.
   Salaries rose 5.6 percent at private, independent colleges and
universities, compared with 4.7 percent at public and
church-related campuses.

   Two congressmen are trying to place a
legislative wall in front of a developer's plans to build a
shopping center next to a historic Civil War battlefield.
   A bill introduced Wednesday by Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., and
Michael Andrews, D-Texas, would direct the Interior Department to
purchase from a developer a 600-acre plot of land adjacent to the
Manassas National Battlefield Park, where two important Civil War
battles were fought.
   The congressmen say plans for a 1.2 million square-foot shopping
center would violate the battlefield site.
   ``We've come to this conclusion because both of us feel there's
no other choice,'' said Andrews. ``Both of us are convinced that
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping
mall.''
   The 3,800-acre Manassas battlefield, about 27 miles west of
Washington, was the site of the first significant land battle of
the Civil War in 1861.
   In a second, three-day battle in 1862, 24,000 Union and
Confederate casualties were recorded, as Union forces that had been
as far south as Richmond 60 days earlier were pushed back into the
nation's capital.

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Plan to Acquire Shopping Mall Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel today voted to seize a
development site adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
in suburban Virginia, rejecting several compromise plans that would
have acquired only part of the parcel.
   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a measure
that would authorize Congress to acquire the entire 542-acre
William Center Development tract, close two heavily-traveled
commuter routes running through the Civil War battlefield and pay
up to $30 million for construction of new roads around the park.
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and
identical to a bill that passed the House by a 307-98 vote last
month, prevailed over a compromise measure by Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., that would have acquired just 80 acres of the tract. Warner
claimed that his proposal would preserve the most important
historical aspects of the site at a cheaper price.
   However, Bumpers maintained that the entire tract was
historically significant.
   ``If we don't act to preserve that property, you can go down
there three weeks from now, and it will be gone, for all intents
and purposes,'' Bumpers said in reference to the frenetic building
pace developer John T. Hazel is carrying out on the property.
``It'll be a shopping mall.''
   Warner estimated that his measure would cost only $20 million,
while estimates for the Bumpers proposal are $60 million or higher.
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., the committee chairman, said he
hoped the bill would reach the Senate floor by next week.
   One potential hangup for the legislation is that it has not gone
through the normal budget process, and could be subject to a
parliamentary challenge on the Senate floor. If such a challenge
arises, 60 votes will be needed to override the procedural question.
   In addition, President Reagan has already threatened to veto any
legislation similar to the Bumpers bill.
   Hazel is planning to build a 1.2 million square-foot shopping
mall, 1.7 million square feet of office space, and 560 homes
adjacent to the 4,200-acre park. Historians claim that the
development, which traffic experts say would generate 80,000 cars
per day, would ruin the historic integrity of the still-rustic
ground on which the First and Second Battles of Manassas were
fought.
   In addition, the development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in Second
Manassas. Historians also claim that Union and Confederate dead lie
in unmarked graves scattered throughout the development area.

   Momentum is building in Congress to protect a
hallowed Civil War battleground from a massive shopping center
complex that a developer wants to build next door.
   The House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee approved a
measure Wednesday authorizing the federal government to seize a
542-acre tract next to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   The bill, a combination of legislation introduced by Rep. Frank
Wolf, R-Va., and another bill sponsored by Reps. Michael Andrews,
D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., now moves to the House floor
after passing the committee by a 27-11 vote. Supporters hope the
matter will come up for a vote when the House reconvenes after the
Democratic National Convention.
   Critics of the measure, including Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.,
complained that the bill was too costly, but it was approved after
the panel defeated an amendment offered by Marlenee that would have
added 11,000 acres to the Custer Battlefield National Monument,
near Billings, Mont.
   The House committee vote came one day after a $10.6 billion
transportation bill passed by the Senate included a provision to
block any federal money from being used for highway construction
associated with the proposed William Center development.
   A similar measure had already been included in transportation
legislation approved by the House, and supporters of the provision
predict it will survive final legislative changes made by House and
Senate members.
   Congress entered the domain of local zoning officials after
historians and preservationists complained that the massive
development would destroy the rural sanctity of the 4,600-acre park
where two important Civil War battles took place.
   Developer John T. Hazel seeks to build a complex including 1.2
million square feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of
office space, and 560 homes. He bought the property in 1985 and
first proposed a small-scale office park for the site, then
expanded his plans to the current concept once Prince William
County, Va., officials relaxed zoning restrictions on the property.
   The park is the site of the First and Second Battles of
Manassas, which were both Confederate victories.

   The Cornfield is partly a barley field now and
there aren't any trees in the North Woods, but both are becoming
federal property more than a century and a quarter after the Blue
and the Grey fought fiercely for them in the Battle of Antietam.
   The Richard King Mellon Foundation and the Conservation Fund
deeded 148 acres of Maryland farmland, including the two Civil War
sites, to the Interior Department on Monday as part of what was
billed as the largest-ever land donation to the government.
   The farm near Antietam Creek is one of 10 properties that the
Pittsburgh-based foundation has purchased at a cost of more than
$21 million for donation to the government by way of the
Conservation Fund, a land and water conservation organization.
   Also handed over on Monday were 93,000 acres of wildlife habitat
in North Carolina. The tract between Albemarle and Pamlico sounds
will be administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Gifts scheduled for transfer later in the year are:
   Five Forks at Dinwiddie, Va., site of a battle known as the
Waterloo of the Confederacy; Forked Lightning Ranch, N.M.,
surrounding the Pecos National Monument; 130 acres of upland
adjoining the marshes and open water of Mackay Island National
Wildlife Refuge, N.C.; a 122-acre addition to the Rachel Carson
National Wildlife Refuge, Maine.
   Also, two tracts totaling 468 acres to be added to Rocky
Mountain National Park, Colo.; two parcels of land on and near
Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park, Va.; and a 135-acre
addition to the Wilderness Area of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania
Memorial National Military Park, Va.
   The Antietam farm contained a 30-acre cornfield when the Battle
of Antietam, the bloodiest single day of fighting in American
history, was fought on Sept. 17, 1862. Of the 23,000 killed and
wounded, 55 percent were struck in and around the Cornfield, as the
site became known.
   Some were buried there, said Edwin C. Bearss, chief historian of
the National Park Service. From 1865 to 1867, the dead were removed
to a Union cemetery in Sharpsburg, Md., and to Confederate burial
places in Shepherdstown, W.Va., and Hagerstown, Md.
   The foundation bought the property from Paul Culler, who, with
his son Lynn, has farmed it for 37 years. They plant it in corn
some years and in barley, oats and hay at other times, in
accordance with modern crop rotation. This year, said Lynn Culler,
they have 18 acres in corn and the rest in barley.
   Richard Rambur, superintendent of Antietam National Battlefield
in Sharpsburg, said the Cornfield would be returned to its original
size and configuration on the basis of contemporary maps. He said
trees would be planted in the woods from which Union troops
advanced into the field.
   The Cullers will continue to farm the property for three or four
years under a lease arrangement with the Park Service, as
guaranteed by their arrangement with the Conservation Fund, Rambur
said. After that, it will be put up for lease by the highest
bidder, like other farmland in national parks.
   The farm includes not only the Cornfield, but most of the North
Woods, the wood lot from which Union troops advanced into the tall
corn. There are no trees in the North Woods now, and Rambur said
trees will be planted to make it the way it was in 1862.
   In addition to the farm, the foundation bought two other pieces
of property, outside the park boundary, that will be held for
possible donation later. Altogether, the 280 acres of land sold for
$1.1 million, Conservation Fund spokesman Jack Lynn said.

<TEXT>
   A foundation is donating more than 100,000
acres of park land, wildlife refuges and historical property,
including a site from the battle of Gettysburg, in one of the
largest gifts of land to the federal government.
   The Richard King Mellon Foundation of Pittsburgh purchased the
properties during the last 1{ years through the Conservation Fund,
which promotes land and water conservation, according to
Conservation Fund senior associate Jack Lynn.
   The foundation, one of the nation's 15 richest, paid $666,000
for 266 acres that include Gettysburg's East Cavalry Field, a site
in the 1863 battle. The foundation will give the site to the
Interior Department as an addition to Gettysburg National Military
Park.
   Tom Wilson, Interior Department spokesman, said that no gift of
land he can recall ``comes close to the magnitude of this kind of
gift. If it is not the biggest, it is one of the biggest.''
   ``I would describe it as a tremendous gift to the people of
America, and indeed to the international visitors who come to our
national parks,'' said James Ridenour, director of the U.S.
National Park Service.
   The gift includes 280 acres of farmland near Sharpsburg, Md.,
that will be added to the Antietam National Battlefield, site of
the 1862 Civil War battle that resulted in more than 20,000
casualties in a single day.
   Ridenour said he considers the preservation of the Civil War
sites especially important because of a ``fever pitch'' of public
interest in the battlefields.
   The largest piece of land is a 93,000-acre tract in coastal
North Carolina near the Alligator River. The property will be known
as the Pocosin National Wildlife Refuge and was purchased for $8.8
million at a U.S. Bankruptcy Court auction.
   ``The casual observer would call it swampy and brackish,''
William Hartwig, realty chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said of the site. Conservationists hope to reintroduce the
endangered red wolf on the property, which is rich in waterfowl.
   The total gift comprises 102,714 acres and is worth more than
$21 million, the foundation said. Seven of the 10 purchases are in
the densely populated East Coast states of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
North Carolina and Virginia.
   Two are in the West, and the other is in Maine.
   The foundation on Tuesday will deliver deeds for the tracts to
U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator William Reilly, Lynn said.
   Jack Lorenz, executive director of the Izaak Walton League, a
national conservation group, called the donation ``a super
initiative.''
   ``It makes you want to genuflect,'' Lorenz said. ``It's a classy
way to start off the Earth decade, the '90s.''
   The other properties are:
   _130 acres near Manteo, N.C., to be added to the MacKay Island
National Wildlife Refuge. Cost: $1 million.
   _The 5,556-acre Forked Lightning Ranch near Pecos, N.M.,
containing more than 100 archaeological sites. Cost: $4.5 million.
The foundation wants the ranch to become a new historical park.
   _Two tracts totaling 1,287 acres in Virginia's Augusta and Mason
counties, bordering Shenandoah National Park. Cost: $950,000.
   _A 930-acre farm in Petersburg, Va., purchased as an addition to
the Petersburg National Battlefield. Cost: $930,000.
   _135 acres near Spotsylvania, Va., to be added to the
Spotsylvania Memorial National Military Park. Cost: $350,000.
   _Two tracts totaling 468 acres bordering the Rocky Mountain
National Park in Estes Park, Colo. The tracts were to have been
converted into a large housing development. Cost: $1.84 million
   _122 acres near Kittery, Maine, to be added to the Rachel Carson
National Wildlife Refuge at the state's southern tip. Cost:
$900,000.
   Banker and industrialist Richard King Mellon created the trust
in 1947, and it since has given more than $150 million to
environmental causes.
   Seward Prosser Mellon, the foundation's president and Richard
Mellon's son, said in a statement that the decline in federal land
purchases and the threats to wetlands show the importance of the
private sector's role in conservation.
   ``Our program will fill the gap whenever possible,'' Mellon
said. ``We feel that this program is an opportunity to say `thank
you' to the many outstanding people at the federal and state levels
who are engaged in land conservation and wildlife preservation and
for our foundation to help protect some of these important sites
during these times of tight budgets so that future generations may
enjoy the outdoors as we have.''

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation that would expand a national park in northern Virginia in order to block a controversial proposed development. 

   The measure, passed on a 307-98 vote, would direct the federal government to buy about 600 acres surrounding the Manassas National Battlefield Park in Prince William County, Va. 

   A private developer wants to build a 1.2 million square-foot office, shopping and residential project on that land, which was the site of Gen. Robert E. Lee's headquarters during the two Civil War Battles of Manassas. 
The battles, in 1861 and 1862, and also known as the Battles of Bull Run, are considered the underdog Confederate forces' greatest victories against the Union army. 

   The cost of the purchase would be determined through negotiations or by the courts. 
The current assessed value of the land is $13 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but "the negotiated or awarded payment may be significantly higher." 

   In the Senate, Republican John Warner of Virginia, an influential voice on the issue, has said he would support the park expansion, which was the subject of a recent page-one article in The Wall Street Journal.

<HEAD>Construction of Part of Shopping Center Near Manassas Battlefield
Halted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANASSAS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of part of a shopping center
adjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park will be halted
indefinitely to prevent damage to federally protected wetlands,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials said today.
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Betty Rankin, president of the
Save the Battlefield Coalition, which has been fighting the
proposed William Center complex.
   ``The Army Corps of Engineers has accomplished, at least
temporarily, what developers and the county refused to do. We all
feel relieved,'' she said.
   The cease-and-desist order issued Wednesday applies to work
being done at Young's Branch, a creek running through the Civil War
battlefield site, and on adjacent wetlands. Developers
Hazel@Peterson Cos. have started construction of one of two roads
that would cross the creek.
   The stop-work order, which extends indefinitely, was issued
because the developers violated a corps provision requiring that
the Army be notified when a project could affect a historic
property, said corps spokesman Bill Brown.
   ``Our concern is with the two roads crossing the creek,'' Brown
said. ``That work could have an impact on the park.''
   John T. (Til) Hazel, president of the development group, has 10
days from receipt of the letter to explain why the Army wasn't
notified about the road, Brown said.
   The stop-work order could entirely block construction of the
project or force the developer to alter its design if an
investigation determines that the park would be adversely affected,
Brown added.
   Preservationists claim construction of the massive project,
which includes a 1.2-million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million
square feet of office space and 560 homes, would destroy 50 acres
of wetlands and ruin beaver dams and rare plants spread throughout
the 542-acre tract.
   Historians feel the project will destroy forever the sanctity of
the still-rustic setting of two crucial Civil War battles.
   Robert Kelly, a spokesman for Hazel@Peterson, told The
Washington Post that his firm would do everything in its power to
comply with the Army's requests.
   The work-stoppage order came as proposals to block the project
were gaining momentum in Congress.
   On Tuesday, a House Interior and Insular Affairs panel held a
hearing on several congressional proposals to take control of the
development tract and add it to the 4,600-acre park.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., on Wednesday offered legislation that
would deprive Hazel@Peterson of direct access to the site from
Interstate 66. The measure failed in the appropriations
subcommittee, but Warner said he would introduce it before the full
Appropriations Committee.

<TEXT>     "It's going to change the way we look at the war. It's going to personalize
the battles, the struggles that went on," said Rich Rambur, superintendent at
Antietam National Battlefield, one of two places where the computerized
directory will be tested come fall.;    "We've spent decades in the
preservation of Civil War land and artifacts. Now, we're preserving the
names.";    The computers are expected to provide names, home states,
regiments, soldiers' ranks and whether they fought for the North or South,
said John F. Peterson of the park service's computer division in Washington.; 
  "It won't prove that your great-grandfather fought at Gettysburg, for
example, but it will tell you what regiment he was in and it will tell you
that that regiment fought at Gettysburg," Peterson said.;    Knowing the
person's regiment, middle initial or home state would help narrow the search
for common names such as Smith and Lee, Peterson said.;    The computers will
provide brief information on the 7,000 Civil War regiments and units, and
information on many of the 10,500 battles, skirmishes and engagements, he
said.;    "We're also going to be able to track where Civil War soldiers are
buried at our 11 Civil War cemeteries within the park system," Peterson said.;
   Computers are to be installed at all 28 Civil War sites that the National
Park Service operates in 21 states and the District of Columbia.;    About 11
million people visit the sites each year. Peterson said the most frequently
asked question is: "Did my great-great-grandfather fight here?";    To answer
the question, park historians now must research pension and service records,
state rosters, census and war records, and county histories.;    Visitors will
be given information on other sources of information, and they'll be
encouraged to continue their research at the National Archives in Washington.;
   The Genealogical Societies of Utah, affiliated with the Mormon Church, and
the Federation of Geneological Societies intend to enter the names on
computer. Otherwise, it would cost the government $4.5 million to hire a
company to computerize all the names.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  GETTYSBURG is under siege, and the struggle is as much over fallow fields as
hallowed ground.;    Spurred by the widening of a nearby highway and the

unprecedented pressure from developers, one of whom is proposing a
320,000-square-foot shopping center that would abut the Civil War battlefield.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BATTLE CRIES HEARD AGAIN AT GETTYSBURG
DEVELOPERS WANT TO BUILD BUT PRESERVATIONISTS
RESIST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The plan has loosed volleys of displeasure not heard since the
Erector-set-like, 330-foot-tall National Tower observation platform was raised
nearly a score of years ago.;    Gettysburg Borough and the surrounding
townships have long been at odds over the nature and amount of development
that should be permitted, with some municipal officials contending that the
economy has suffered by attempts to keep the park setting pristine.;   
"There's an attitude toward the park here that's very negative -- even
defiant," said Richard H. Schmoyer, planning director for Adams County.;   
Proposed for a 75-acre site in adjacent Straban Township, Mark Development
Co.'s Gettysburg Commons features 25 to 30 stores, a cinema and 1,900 parking
spaces. It also falls partly within the 12,000-acre federally protected
Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District, which encompasses the 6,000-acre
Gettysburg National Military Park.;    As a result, Civil War buffs and
preservationists are left wondering whether Gen. George Pickett's charge will
be remembered as the final, bloodiest confrontation of the Civil War battle,
or thought of as a method of payment at the new department store.;    "We
cannot permit the visual desecration of one of the most hallowed sites in
America," said Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., co-sponsor of 1990 legislation
that significantly expanded the boundaries of the military park. "There are
plenty of places in which to build shopping centers, but allowing one to be
built within sight of the Gettysburg battlefield would be a tragic mistake."; 
  At issue is the view of the battlefield and the town from Benner's Hill, a
crown of land that, while not a major overlook, affords a vista that hasn't
changed much in 118 years. In the fields below, Union forces won a decisive
victory over Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederates in a series of battles July
1-4, 1863.;    "If they build where they say," said Assistant Park
Superintendent Robert E. Davidson, "the shopping center would come into view
very dramatically.";    Keep view open;  Walter L. Powell, Gettysburg
Borough's preservation officer, said: "That view is critical. It is part of
the historic view shed that should be kept as open as possible.";    Others
see the proposal differently, including county planning director Schmoyer, who
has said the shopping center "would not be the worst thing that could happen
there.";    "There is a history of discouraging growth here, and a price has
been paid for it," he said.;    In 1989, Adams County ranked 59th out of
Pennsylvania's 67 counties in average annual wages, far below the other
counties in the eastern half of the state. Many service workers live in mobile
home parks surrounding the borough.;    Three years ago, when Schmoyer
arrived, he warned that when widening of U.S. Route 15 near Gettysburg was
completed, there would be massive development pressure at the four local
interchanges.;    Taken seriously now;  "Few took him seriously then,"
preservation officer Powell said. "They do now.";    Now, with Route 15
serving as a major four-lane highway between Harrisburg and Frederick, Md.,
the Gettysburg area has become attractive as a bedroom community for those
cities, as well as Baltimore and even Washington, 90 driving minutes away.;   
Wal-Mart, the mammoth discount chain, cited the highway and proximity to
Maryland's market among reasons for building in Straban Township.;    Now
property owners are keen with anticipation over Wal-Mart's legendary drawing
power for shoppers -- and developers.;    Mother of all museums;  Dusan
Bratic, a Carlisle lawyer who owns 105 acres at a Route 15 interchange, has
proposed building a kind of mother of all war museums, honoring Americans who
have fought in conflicts beginning with World War I.;    Bratic would not
reveal other plans he might have for his property, except to say he was
bullish on something being done to help the local economy.;    "People these
days are looking for more than Gettysburg has to offer," he said. "The
historic stuff is fine, but people want something to do at night.";   
Although Adams County last year imposed an interchange zoning ordinance along
the three Straban interchanges, it was too late to prevent Route 30, a key
entryway to the borough and battlefield, from becoming a homogenized,
stripped-out melange of 20th-century motel and fast-food culture.;    Are we
in Texas?; "The real tragedy of that strip is that you could be in Waco,
Texas, as easily as Adams County," Powell said.;    Preservationists are still
smarting over the Wal-Mart site, parking for which required knocking down a
two-story Greek Revival-style brick farmhouse, circa 1840, that was used as a
field hospital during the battle.;    The farmhouse was supplanted, circa
1991, by Wendy's.;    "We don't want the National Park Service to come off as
being anti-development; that's not a realistic stand to take," Davidson said
in his office across from the National Cemetery. "We'd like to play a role in
seeing that the development is sensitive to the historical resources."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Senate Won't Pass Bill To Seize Land Adjacent To Battlefield Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate won't pass a bill for a
``legislative taking'' of land adjacent to the Manassas National
Battlefield Park in suburban Virginia to prevent the construction
of a shopping center, the chairman of the committee involved said
Wednesday.
   The House passed the bill 307-98 on Aug. 10, taking the 542-acre
Williams Center tract and providing up to $30 million in
compensation. Such a seizure of land is rare and leaves to a later
court determination how much the owner should get.
   Prince William County authorities already have approved the
shopping center, which is to be accompanied by office and
residential development on the tract.
   The controversy has galvanized many environmentalists and Civil
War buffs who see desecration in the location of a shopping center
next to the park commemorating the First and Second Battles of
Manassas in the Civil War.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said he intended to vote for the measure and
expected to send it to the floor.
   But the bill violates a Senate rule against bringing
``entitlement'' legislation to the floor outside of the budget
process, and the Budget Committee is unlikely to waive the rule, he
said.
   Sixty senators could vote to set the rule aside, but Johnston
said, ``I frankly don't think it'll pass a 60-vote point of order
at this time in this session.''
   Still, he told his colleagues during a discussion of the bill at
a committee meeting, ``we are at least saying this is a high
priority and this kind of land should not be lost.''
   The ranking Republican, James McClure of Idaho, said the last
``legislative taking,'' a seizure of redwood forest lands in
California in 1980, had been projected to cost $349 million but
would cost $1.4 billion.
   He said land in the Manassas area was now selling for $17 to
$17.50 per square foot, so the entire tract could cost $413 million
at the higher figure.
   McClure noted that the committee had left the tract in private
hands when it enlarged the park in 1980, deciding that it was not
significant enough historically to include in the park.
   ``We made a mistake'' in 1980, said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.,
chairman of the national park subcommittee, in arguing for support
of the House bill.
   ``We have a necessity to understand how we got where we are,''
Bumpers said in arguing for the significance of the tract.
   James McPherson, author of the recent highly praised one-volume
history of the Civil War, ``Battle Cry of Freedom,'' testified at a
subcommittee hearing that the Second Battle of Manassas was the
most significant of the war for the South, Bumpers said.

   The remains of four Union soldiers were

   Relic seekers from Ohio discovered the remains of the front-line
soldiers in March 1988, and anthropologists and archaeologists have
been studying them since.
   On Sunday, the remains were sealed inside a plain, pine coffin
and buried with full military honors at Antietam National Cemetery.
   An estimated 450 people watched the Civil War funeral at the
11-acre hilltop cemetery near Sharpsburg, where the remains of
nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   The four soldiers found were members of the Irish Brigade from
New York, which charged the Confederate line Sept. 17, 1862, and
were killed by rifle fire.
   They were among more than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers
who were killed, wounded or missing after the Battle of Antietam,
which climaxed Gen. Robert E. Lee's two attempts to push the war
farther north. The battle is described as the single bloodiest day
of the war.
   ``The massive number of dead in the battle made the interment
paramount,'' said Dennis Frye, a historian with the National Park
Service. ``They did not have time to properly bury individuals with
independent memorial services.''
   Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the
fallen soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other
was about 45 years old. ``The older fellow had arthritis in his
shoulder bones,'' he said.
   ``This was a very unique opportunity because you have the ability
to associate with the men who went into battle,'' Owsley said.
``Normally, you have the artifacts without the bones.''
   About 85 men from re-enactment units representing the 28th
Massachusetts and the 93rd Pennsylvania regiments camped at Antietam
and assisted with the burial and a Roman Catholic Mass.
   The morning service was held along ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road
in the middle of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for
nearly four hours that day.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said Collin MacDonald, 38, of Centreville, Va., who
served as a commander for the event. ``This is the first Civil War
burial that the park has had this century. The re-enactors who are
here are making history.''
   A hazy ridge of South Mountain provided a distant backdrop for
the Mass. The coffin, which rested on sawhorses, was covered with a
34-star American flag. Some of the soldiers, dressed in navy coats
and light blue slacks, knelt on one knee during the service. Smoke
from morning campfires filled the air.
   Pallbearers placed the coffin on a horse-drawn cart drapped in
black, and the soldiers donned black arm bands before starting a
milelong procession from Bloody Lane to the cemetery. The group
marched to a somber beat of drums draped in black.

   Jody Powell is volunteering the public
relations skills he practiced in the White House to fight plans for
a shopping mall near fields where his Confederate ancestors fought.
   Powell, who was President Carter's press secretary, is putting
the resources of his firm, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Public Affairs of
Washington at the disposal of groups joined in the Save the
Battlefield Coalition.
   Powell said Tuesday the fight to preserve the site near the
Manassas Battlefield National Park is worthwhile because
encroaching development is a problem at many other battlefields and
historic sites as well.
   ``Goodness, if you can't stop something this bad, then what
hopes do you have of fending off more creeping sorts of problems,
where a park gets nibbled to death?'' Powell said.
   Ten of his family members fought at the Battle of Second
Manassas in 1862, part of which was waged on land where the
Hazel-Peterson Cos. of Fairfax plan to break ground for William
Center.
   One of Powell's ancestors was mortally wounded just before the
battle, as Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson
raided the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction.
   On the site where Gen. Robert E. Lee built his headquarters
during Second Manassas, Hazel-Peterson and the Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. of Ohio plan to build a 1.2 million-square-foot shopping mall.

   Everybody seems to want a piece of Virginia's Prince William County. 
Not just any old piece of this Washington bedroom community will do, however. 
What the media, environmentalists, Civil War groups, citizen activists and lawmakers have their sights set on is prime real estate. 
Never mind that someone else already owns the land in question. 
In hearings scheduled today before the House Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Land, they're backing legislation to seize it. 

   At issue are 542 acres adjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park, site of two major battles in the War Between the States. 
When the landowner announced earlier this year plans to put a mall, office space and residences on the site -- known as the William Center project -- opponents massed for the latest battle of Manassas. 

   The mall, they said, would be an eyesore, increase traffic and hurt the park's integrity. 
Jonathan Yardley of the Washington Post and Tom Wicker of the New York Times, respectively, wrote paeans to the park's "ethereally beautiful wooded countryside" and warned against the "desecration of hallowed ground." 
Jimmy Carter's former press secretary, Jody Powell, said that because 10 of his ancestors had fought at Manassas he was giving anti-mall forces free P.R. help. 
Congressmen, urged on by mall opponents, jumped in with legislation to take the land. 

   Opposing this federal invasion is a less-celebrated group of citizens and county officials who regard it as unwarranted intrusion into local land-use decisions vital to the county's well-being. 
Prince William's population, now 205,000, is soaring and the county is counting on the expected $87 million in net tax revenues from the William Center in the next 20 years, along with $23 million annually after that, to help pay for services. 
Officials say the number of residents, already up by 50,000 since 1980, will likely increase by 100,000 by 2000. 

   As it is now, the official capacity for the county's school buildings has been exceeded by more than 3,000 students. 
And problems don't stop with education. 
"We have all the fundamental municipal needs, and we cannot continue to finance all those needs on the backs of homeowners," says Kathleen Seefeldt, chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. 

   What she and other officials fear is creeping federal sovereignty under the guise of preservation. 
The government already controls 20% of the county's land for parks and a Marine base. 
For that sizable chunk the county receives a mere $20,139 annually in lieu of taxes. 
If park borders spread over the mall site, the county will gain a few more dollars in federal contributions but lose millions in taxes. 

   For all the highly publicized opposition, evidence abounds that many residents are more interested in seeing local business rather than the park expand. 
Last year, residents of the district in which the William Center is located elected a pro-economic growth real-estate agent to the Board of Supervisors with 57% of the vote. 
Two area chambers of commerce merged into a single group to support the construction of the mall project. 

   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has proposed a compromise: The mall could invite increased traffic on two roads now bisecting the park; Mr. Hodel has offered to close the roads, restore them to Civil War condition and replace them with a bypass. 
He also would move the mall to a lower elevation, eliminating its "visual intrusion" on the park. 

   The Board of Supervisors unanimously endorsed the compromise last month but anti-mall forces still want the government to take the land -- at an estimated cost of $70 million to taxpayers. 
For all their professed concern about the park's integrity, many of the residents' true motivations appear to be simply to stop growth. 

   "How long do you think this rural area could survive the influx of all those people who would come with a mall?" asked a leading civic activist. 
Another woman, who moved to the "boondocks" in Prince William 12 years ago, said she had "done nothing but fight" intrusions on that rural atmosphere ever since. 

   In fact, there is no evidence the William Center property actually was a major battlefield. 
A study last year revealed no significant fighting on the site, no historic structures and no soldiers' graves. 
These findings justified, in effect, Congress's decision not to purchase the ground when it last expanded the park in 1980. 

   If preservation arguments prove insufficient, anti-mall forces are ready to try other means. 
Last week they demanded a halt to the project because it could harm wetlands said to be on the site. 

   Says county Supervisor Edwin King, "I have said that most of the people locally who are opposing this {project} would oppose any use of the property with a greater density than a Confederate cemetery. 
That's the basic issue here. 
A lot of those people would have been thrilled if the gates to Prince William County had been locked the day after they arrived." 

   A no-growth agenda is legitimate politics, of course. 
The question is whether Congress wants to sign on to it at the expense of local land-use planning, taxpayers and individual property rights.

   When Congress returns from its Labor Day
recess, the Senate will join the controversy over whether a
developer can build a shopping mall adjacent to the famous Civil
War battlefield at Manassas, Va.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests announced Thursday a hearing will
be held Sept. 8, a day after Congress returns, to consider
legislation directing the federal government to purchase the
542-acre William Center tract adjacent to the Manassas National
Battlefield Park.
   The Confederacy won two battles at Manassas just west of
Washington in 1861 and 1862.
   The subcommittee will hold the hearing on the bill passed by the
House on Wednesday, which orders the federal government to buy the
land.
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who made the announcement of the
hearing, said he will introduce legislation to purchase only part
of the developer's tract. Estimates of the purchase price in the
House bill have ranged from $15 million to $100 million.
   The House bill provides for the federal government to take
immediate ownership of the developer's tract under a rarely used
procedure known as a legislative taking. A fair price for the
developer would be worked out later.
   In addition, the bill authorizes up to $30 million to close two
major highways crossing the park.
   Officials at the Office of Management and Budget and Interior
Department have said they would recommend that President Reagan
veto the measure if Congress enacts it in its current form.
   Developer John T. Hazel purchased the land two years ago for
less than $10 million. He wants to build 1.2 million square feet of
retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office space and 560 homes.
   Opponents contend the development would mar the natural sanctity
of the park.

   A Virginia congressman introduced legislation
Wednesday he said would speed congressional efforts to protect the
Manassas National Battlefield from encroaching commercial
development.
   The bill by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., calls for immediate
government acquisition of the approximately 600 acres adjacent to
the park where a developer plans to build a shopping mall.
   It also directs the interior secretary to make sure the scenery
around the park is protected, calls for closing two roads that
bisect the Civil War site and proposes a bypass to carry traffic
around the area.
   A bill already has been introduced for government purchase of
the land now owned by Hazel-Peterson Co. developers, but it directs
acquisition through the Interior Department, a slower process than
the ``legislative taking'' of the land recommended by Wolf.
   The earlier legislation was introduced by Reps. Robert Mrazek,
D-N.Y., and Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and by Wednesday had 166
co-sponsors.
   Tad Boggs, Mrazek's press secretary, said the congressman ``is
wholeheartedly endorsing the (Wolf) bill.''
   ``He hopes that it can be melded together with his bill, but it
accomplishes everything he hopes to see done,'' Boggs said.
   ``I think everyone should be pleased that a Virginian has
finally said no to the shopping mall,'' Andrews said.
   Stan Parris, another Virginia congressman whose district is near
the battlefield just outside Washington, said he will co-sponsor
Wolf's bill.
   Rep. D. French Slaughter Jr., whose district includes the park,
is studying the bill, according to his administrative assistant,
George White.
   Ian Spatz, spokesman for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, which also has been fighting the developer, said his
organization was encouraged to have Wolf's support.
   ``We want to study it further, but it looks like something we
could support,'' said Spatz. ``(Wolf's plan) provides more
certainty that the property owner would get paid for the property.''
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel had proposed that the developer
move the shopping mall so it would not be visible from the park. He
also said the roads bisecting the park should be closed.
   Though preservationists like the idea of closing the roads, they
say the mall should not be anywhere near the park because of
traffic problems it would create.

<HEAD>Warner Vows To Push For Plan To Offset Impact Of Shopping Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., to close
roads through the Manassas National Battlefield Park was killed by
a Senate panel Friday, but Warner vowed to revive the plan in talks
with House members.
   ``I'm going to do my best to try and go forward with planning
roads,'' Warner said after the Senate Appropriations Committee
rejected his request for $2.8 million to study ways to cut off two
heavily traveled roads that run through the historic Civil War
battlefield.
   Warner's compromise plan, which is similar to a previous
Interior Department proposal, is part of a federal effort to reduce
the impact of a proposed 1.2 million square foot shopping center on
the nearby national park.
   Warner does not oppose the commercial complex, but believes that
closing roads within the park would lessen the development's impact
on the battleground.
   Historians and preservationists argue that the complex, which
also would include 1.7 million square feet of office space and 560
homes, would forever violate the sanctity of the still-rustic
battlefield.
   Three measures now under consideration in the House would either
authorize the federal government to purchase the land or scuttle
the shopping center plan by preventing federal highway money from
being used for roads to and from the development.
   Before Warner's plan can again be considered, an amendment that
would prevent federal money from being used for highway
construction associated with the development must be dropped from a
House appropriations bill.
   Congressional rules stipulate that if that amendment, offered by
Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., Warner's amendment could then be
reconsidered in future talks between House and Senate conferees.
   Mrazek is not likely to drop his amendment, at least until the
outcome of the land-purchase bills is clear, said Tad Boggs, a
spokesman for the congressman.
   Plans to purchase the property offered by Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., and a similar measure by Mrazek and Rep. Michael Andrews,
D-Texas, would also close two roads running through the park and
build new roads around it.
   Buying the 542-acre development site and adding it to the
4,600-acre battlefield park is not an option, at least in the
Senate, Warner said.
   The mall site is currently valued at $13.5 million, but the
ultimate selling price would likely be three times higher _ a
figure approaching the federal government's annual appropriation
for park purchases.

<TEXT>
   The roads and hillsides winding through
Antietam National Battlefield are to be softly lit Saturday night
with 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or
missing after the Civil War's bloodiest battle.
   ``It's a memorial and Christmas is the season of lights. We just
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' Richard
Rambur, battlefield superintendent, said Friday. ``Everybody talks
about 23,000, but not very many people really have an idea of how
many that is.''
   Up to 5,000 automobilies are expected to join a 4.5-mile tour of
the battlefield near Sharpsburg, about 70 miles west of Baltimore.
Candles glowing inside lunch-sized paper bags filled with sand will
outline the roadways and others will dot the snow-covered
3,200-acre battleground.
   More men were killed or wounded at Antietam on Sept. 17, 1862,
than on any other single day of the Civil War. Union losses were
12,410 and Confederate losses totaled 10,700. It was the single
bloodiest day of American military history.
   ``You're really going to get an impression of what kind of
impact that was,'' Rambur said. ``When they drive through here,
they're going to feel something, I'm sure.''
   In addition to the bags of lighted candles, choirs will be
singing at various spots in the battlefield, including the Dunker
Church, the focal point of repeated clashes as both armies sought
to occupy and control high ground at the site.
   A Civil War-era encampment, complete with uniformed re-enactors,
recaptures the atmosphere of a wintertime camp 127 years ago. The
soldiers will gather at Bloody Lane, a sunken road near the center
of the battlefield where four hours of fighting left more than
5,000 dead or injured.
   Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of
Antietam, but the conflict climaxed the first of Confederate
general Robert E. Lee's two attempts to carry the war into the
North. The battle also gave President Abraham Lincoln an
opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all
slaves in the United States in 1863.
   An estimated 500 volunteers from church and civic groups,
historical organizations, scouting troops and area businesses have
assembled the lights, said Washington County Tourism Director Bob
O'Connor. The battlefield was divided into 23 grids and groups
assigned to each section are responsible for arranging and lighting
1,000 candles and retrieving them after the five-hour display.
   All 23,110 tapers will be lit in the 30 minutes between dusk and
dark, O'Connor said. ``We don't know of any (battlefield) where
this has been done to this magnitude,'' he said.
   Rambur said organizers are encouraging volunteers to maintain a
somber attitude while lighting the candles.
   ``This is a memorial and we're trying to stress that. We do not
want Santa Clauses and that kind of thing,'' Rambur said. ``If we
learn anything from the battlefields, it is that there just has to
be another answer to war.''

   ``I was one of the people who was galvanized to action by that
particular incident,'' says SHAF president Clemens, who teaches
theater at Hagerstown Junior College and describes himself as ``a
Civil War fanatic.''
   ``We decided that we had just had enough.''
   Eric Seifarth, agricultural land preservation specialist for the
county planning department, said recently that Washington County
lost about 1,700 acres of farmland to development in fiscal 1989
and could have none left for the next generation if the rate
continues. He said there are between 50,000 and 80,000 acres of
prime farmland left in the 293,000-acre county.
   In a recent article in National Parks Magazine, Richard Rambur,
superintendent of the Antietam park, said that when he arrived in
August 1987, he found that 33 percent of the working population of
south Washington County was commuting to Washington or Baltimore,
each about 75 miles from Sharpsburg.
   In nearby Shepherdstown, W.Va., the population is expected to
double within five years with the advent of a new housing
development for nearly 2,000 people, Rambur said in an interview.
   The trend is indeed becoming obvious. The argument is over what
to do about it.
   ``It's not just simply a case of `The developers are coming, the
developers are coming.' It's a question of who are the
developers,'' said Ann Corcoran, a SHARP member who, with her
husband, Howard, operates a 300-acre farm adjacent to and partially
within the battlefield.
   The county established a 23-member commission of farmers,
realtors and others and in June 1989 adopted its final product, a
plan called the Antietam Overlay. It requires review of all new
home construction in the 2,900 acres surrounding the 815-acre
battlefield, lays down standards to make commerical buildings on
approach roads compatible with the historic character of the area,
and calls for an approved forestry plan for timber clear-cutting on
nearby Red Hill.
   At this point, SHARP was formed, telling area residents in a
letter it ``suspected that the enactment of the Overlay was ... the
beginning of a larger scheme to preserve the viewshed around the
battlefield to make it more attractive to tourists and commercial
developers.'' The organization also maintains that restrictions in
the Overlay would make modern farming more difficult. SHAF, on the
other hand, supports the Overlay.
   SHARP proposed a plan under which landowners around the
battlefield would sell development rights to their property, at a
suggested $4,000 an acre, to keep it in agricultural use. About
half the money would come from the state and the rest would be
raised from private sources. The organization also filed suit
challenging the Overlay. The county has asked that the suit be
dismissed.
   The Park Service has developed three alternatives for the future
of the battlefield.
   One alternative calls for keeping the battlefield basically as
it is. The second calls for expanding the park by as much as 250
acres to take in the Grove Farm and other sites, eliminating fences
and roads and taking other steps to make such battlegrounds as the
Miller cornfield and the eroded gulley known as Bloody Lane look
more as they did in 1862. The third is a compromise between the
two. Rambur predicts there will be further compromise before some
plan is adopted in six months or so.
   The state of Maryland is also interested.
   At a meeting in January at the battlefield visitors center, Gov.
William Donald Schaefer announced plans for a non-profit trust that
would combine private grants and charitable contributions to
augment state and county payments for land development rights.
   This plan is more historically oriented and would impose more
severe restrictions on development than the agricultural easements
envisioned by SHARP.
   Millard and Nancy Kefauver, meanwhile, continue living inside
the park boundaries in their privately owned home, which served as
a Union field hospital during the battle.
   ``We sort of felt like we knew as much about protecting it as
the Park Service did,'' Mrs. Kefauver says.
   ``They are very nervous and concerned about what plans the Park
Service has for them,'' Ms. Corcoran says.
   In Washington, preservationists have a different concern. They
are pushing for legislation intended to give federal protection to
endangered historic sites somewhat like the protection now given to
endangered species of wildlife.
   ``It really is remarkable to say that the snail darter enjoys
more federal protection than the Antietam Battlefield,'' says J.
Jackson Walter, president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.

battles because she is female.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's illegal, and it's a matter of principle," said Cook, who filed a
federal lawsuit this month asking that the Interior Department be ordered to
let women join Civil War events at national parks.;    It's exciting to carry
a musket and simulate Civil War battles, said Cook, who works as a spokeswoman
for the George Mason University law school in Arlington, Va.;    "You get what
we call a 'period rush,' " she said. "There are times . . . when you
absolutely feel like you're time-traveling -- when you're actually out there
marching along and there are no 20th-century intrusions at all.";    Cook and
her husband, Fred Burgess, spend most weekends involved in Civil War events.
They even had a Civil War-era wedding last fall at Gettysburg, asking all
guests to dress in period costume.;    The National Park Service doesn't allow
actual battle re-enactments, instead holding "living history" portrayals such
as camp-outs and marching and firing drills, where the public can talk to the
"soldiers." Battle re-enactments are held on state and private land.;   
Although Cook works hard to impersonate a man -- binding her chest, wearing
her hair short and talking with a husky voice -- one park official says that
isn't good enough.;    The programs at Antietam National Battlefield in
Sharpsburg, Md., are intended to reflect what actually happened during the
Sept. 17, 1862, battle, park Superintendent Richard Rambur said.;    "If
you're going to portray anything here at Antietam, you have to portray an
accurate picture," he said.;    The park also restricts children from
portraying soldiers, he said, adding that while some children may have fought
at Antietam, "it does not portray the norm, and that's what we do here.";   
More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded or
reported missing at Antietam. The park holds about a dozen weekend events a
year to portray different facets of the battle.;    But those aren't the roles
Cook has trained to portray. As a member of the 21st Georgia volunteer
infantry and two other Civil War organizations, she's learned to play the fife
and has studied military tactics.;    "I think I do a far better job than a
lot of the men out there," she said.;    Some national parks have allowed Cook
and other women to march and join firing drills as male soldiers. But she was
barred from participating at Antietam, and stayed away from an event at
Harpers Ferry National Park in West Virginia after being told she wouldn't be
included.;    At a re-enactment last year of the surrender at Appomattox, she
successfully passed herself off as a man.;    Her lawyer, Clint Bolick,
describes the U.S. District Court lawsuit as "a straightforward sex
discrimination case." No hearing date has been set for the suit.  </TEXT>

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Across the land, preservationists are trying to
block the developers' bulldozers and among the main arenas in this
conflict are the plantations and battlefields of Virginia. It's not
enough just to save the sites, preservationists argue, but to
preserve the historic integrity of the surrounding areas as well.

   From George Washington's Mount Vernon
to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, from Yorktown to Appomattox,
preservationists are fighting to save Virginia's rich vistas and
historic heritage.
   Their foes are those who want to build modern homes, factories
and office buildings alongside Civil War battlefields and
18th-century plantations.
   ``What Virginians have done very well is to save the houses
where Jefferson and Washington have slept and ate,'' says Carter
Hudgins, director of the Center for Historic Preservation at Mary
Washington College in Fredericksburg. ``It's easy to save those
things which are one of a kind.
   ``The more difficult thing is to go the next step and save the
surrounding land, which puts the site in perspective. If you lose
the setting, you lose the context. You lose the meaning of what the
world was all about to begin with.
   ``It's very, very difficult to get people to understand that
anyone who goes to visit Monticello will have an experience that's
diminished dramatically if they stand on top of Thomas Jefferson's
mountain and gaze on the rear end of condominiums.''
   Virginia's preservationists don't stand alone.
   Across the nation many historic sites are threatened by
development and neglect, says Peter Brink, vice president for
programs and services at the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in Washington.
   For example, in South Pasadena, Calif., a proposed six-mile
freeway would cut through five National Register historic districts
and destroy 1,500 homes.
   ``To an extent, we are seeing more potential conflicts between
preservationists and developers, especially on the East Coast and
West Coast, because of the type of urban sprawl that is
happening,'' Brink says. ``What's needed is a way to plan
development, channel it so it doesn't obliterate the countryside.''
   Preservationists also need to plan ahead so they are working to
control development before the bulldozers are rolling, he says.
That is happening now at Antietam National Battlefield Park in
Maryland, much of which is still privately owned.
   Historic sites are often saved by, not in spite of, developers,
Brink says.
   ``Three-fourths of the time, we consider ourselves partners with
developers,'' he says.
   In January, officials at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville dropped plans to swap land at the base of
Monticello Mountain so a large office complex could be built on the
site.
   People in Stafford County have debated whether the land
adjoining George Washington's boyhood home should be zoned for
commercial use.
   In Culpeper, Va., California developer Lee C. Sammis has
acquired 5,200 acres along the Rappahannock River on land where the
Battle of Brandy Station was fought in 1863. Historians have
described that as one of history's last great calvary battles.
   Sammis has offered for public use 242 acres that a historic
consultant deemed significant to the battle, says Michael Armm,
development director for the project called Elkwood Downs. The land
offered is connected by trails.
   Armm agreed that ``there has to be some perspective,'' a buffer
around the property. But some critics complain that ``if you stand
on the site and look around, you shouldn't be able to see anything
that wasn't seen from the battle,'' he says.
   ``Some kid a hundred years from now is going to get interested
in the Civil War and want to see these places. He's going to go
down there and be standing in a parking lot. I'm fighting for that
kid,'' says Brian Pohanka, a local historian. He was one of
hundreds protesting the plans on the 127th anniversary of the
battle in June.
   It's too late for some places.
   Factories spew smoke across the James River from Shirley
Plantation in Charles City County. Last year, 53,500 tourists
visited the plantation built in the 1700s. A subdivision has been
built downriver from the factories.
   Trees planted across the river in Chesterfield County have
helped some to obscure the sight, says Charles Carter, whose family
lives on the plantation.
   ``Tourists are dismayed. I have had more than one group of
English folk who said, `We'd never allow this.'
   ``Once the historic integrity of an area has been affected, it
doesn't go back the other way.''
   In Waterford, residents concerned about development inching west
from Washington formed a compact and are raising money to buy
property. They have asked farmers who own the land surrounding the
town for the right of refusal when they sell their land, says
Katherine Ladd, director of the Waterford Foundation. The compact
and its negotiations with developers led to Waterford being removed
from the National Trust's list of endangered historic places.
   Would-be restorers of historic property can take advantage of a
rehabilitation tax credit, which allows a one-time federal income
tax deduction of 20 percent of the federal income tax up to $7,000,
Brink says.
   In Virginia, the Threatened Property Fund, created in 1988,
provides $500,000 a year to help restore and save historic
properties, says David J. Brown, executive director of Preservation
Alliance of Virginia, and director of the fund.
   The money is used to create a revolving fund to buy properties
and resell them and to buy easements that restrict what a later
owner could do with the property.
   The state also allows localities to freeze real estate taxes on
historic property at a lower level.
   ``These kinds of incentives and credits encourage people to go
ahead and take those risks,'' Brown says.
   ``It's not feasible to save them all.''

<HEAD>Critics Charge VIP Riders Taking Money from Historical Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANASSAS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle and his family
like riding government-owned horses at Manassas National
Battlefield Park, but such VIP privilege may harm the park's
historical interpretive efforts, employees say.
   Quayle and his three children _ Tucker, 15, Benjamin, 12, and
Corinne, 10 _ are regular visitors to the park, according to the
vice president's office. The family is accompanied by Secret
Services agents and local law enforcement officials.
   They ride the park's nine horses _ normally used for park
security patrols and not available for public use.
   ``You have the vice president riding U.S. government horses at a
park that is designed for historical preservation and in which the
staff is trying to control recreational use,'' said former park
historian John Hennessey, now with the New York State Division of
Parks.
   ``You have money going into maintaining these government horses
... while anyone can see the woeful condition of the rest of the
operation. What type of message does that send to the public?''
   Park Supervisor Ken Apschnikat said that while the park's horses
are not for public use, the visits by Quayle and his family are ``a
different situation'' and the use of national park facilities by
members of the executive branch is common.
   Other guest riders have included Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
Jr., who has been riding twice, according to park spokesman Tom
Wilson.
   David Beckwith, the vice president's press secretary, said he
was unaware of complaints about the Quayles' horseback riding. ``He
enjoys it... and says it's quite beautiful,'' Beckwith said.
   Some park staff members and Hennessey, an expert on the Civil
War battles of First and Second Manassas, see the VIP trail rides
principally as a symptom of a horse program that's grown larger
than needed _ thus draining resources from interpretive services
and preservation activities.
   ``This is the worst year in the three years I've been here,''
said Ed Raus, who heads the battlefield's interpretive staff. ``We
don't have the staff to operate the programs we once did. It
definitely has been frustrating.''
   The park, site of the two Bull Run battles in which more than
22,000 soldiers died, has had to scale back its interpretive
programs.
   Raus said his department's budget has decreased from about 15
percent to 11 percent of the park's $933,000 budget this fiscal
year. The department has laid off three employees since 1988 and
suspended some bus tours and living history exhibits.
   New signs that tell the story of those who fought and died here
in July 1861 and August 1862 sit in storage, while the old system
of recorded messages that explained what occurred at specific sites
is mute.
   ``People come in and say, `we can't understand what went on,'''
said Robert E. Lee Krick, a history major working this summer as a
park interpreter. ``They ask, `Where's the bus tour from last year,
what happened to the voice boxes?'''
   In addition, battlefield sites are in need of repair.
   Apschnikat said the cutbacks stem from increases in the park's
fixed operating costs, especially salaries, coupled with a
1,200-acre expansion during the past five years.
   Park officials said it was impossible to determine the amount of
time a specific ranger or other employee might spend on a
horse-related project.
   ``You see the horse program growing and growing and growing, and
everything else going down hill,'' said park administrative officer
Jane Becker. ``You see things falling apart, you must ask where is
the money going.''

   Re-enactments staged on the great
battlefields of the Civil War usually end the same way _ with boys
in blue routing the Confederate gray.
   But not so in Mississippi this summer.
   At Vicksburg, cannons will boom and muskets flash over the Fourth
of July weekend to commemorate a clear-cut Confederate victory over
Yankee troops when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant made his first major
attempt to silence the Mississippi River fortress 126 years ago.
   And at Brice's Cross Roads in Lee County, scene of a textbook
attack by Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry,
historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown Southern dead
with 102 stones bearing the names of Rebel soldiers known to have
been killed in the June 10, 1864, battle.
   The Vicksburg artillery demonstrations and engagements by several
hundred re-enactors will take place Saturday and Sunday on private
land in Vicksburg where the actual engagement being commemorated
occurred on May 22, 1863.
   Grant's all-out attack was beaten back by the Vicksburg garrison
during a one-day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killed
or wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties.
   Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, Grant encircled
the city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender 47
days later on July 4, 1863.
   ``Last year was the first year we had a re-enactment at Vicksburg
and, since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege, we felt it
only appropriate to do the last few days of it, including the
surrender,'' said Gordon Cotton, director of the Old Court House
Museum and organizer of the ``Vicksburg Civil War Re-enactment.''
   ``We did not realize when we planned last year's event that
re-living those days would be so emotionally straining on everyone
here,'' said Cotton.
   ``This year, the re-enactors wanted to do something different,
something very dramatic and we didn't want to go through another
defeat,'' he said. ``So this battle was the obvious choice.''
   Across the state in Lee County, history buff Charles Sullivan and
his associates found another way to remember a Confederate victory.
   ``Up to this point, all the battlefields I have marked were of
Confederate defeats,'' said Sullivan, a department head at
Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College's Perkinston campus and
Confederate graves registrar in Mississippi for the Sons of
Confederate Veterans. ``This time it was different.''
   At the Brice's Cross Roads battlefield, about six miles west of
Baldwyn, Forrest won a major tactical victory over Gen. S.D.
Sturgis' larger Union force. When the fighting ended, over 1,500
Union soldiers had been captured.
   ``For Forrest, it was a textbook battle that has been studied at
war colleges around the world,'' said Sullivan, who will participate
in the re-enactment at Vicksburg. ``Many believe this was his
greatest victory for, heavily outnumbered, he was able to destroy
the federal cavalry first and then the infantry.''
   Sullivan said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at the
battle site sometime after 1930, following passage of a federal law
allowing military stones for fallen Confederates.
   ``Thanks to the research of a friend named Roger Hansen, who has
a network of colleagues throughout the country who trade information
on Confederate dead, we were able to identify 102 men killed at the
crossroads on the Confederate side.''
   Sullivan said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order
``because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do not
know exactly where each body was situated.''

   A horse-drawn cart draped in black
transported the partial remains of four Union soldiers to their
final resting place in a funeral marking the Battle of Antietam's
127th anniversary.
   About 85 men dressed in Civil War uniforms gave full military
honors Sunday to the four fallen members of the Irish Brigade from
New York whose bones were found in March 1988 by relic hunters in a
field near the battleground.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said 38-year-old Collin MacDonald, who served as
commander for the reburial.
   He said it was the western Maryland park's first Civil War burial
this century.
   An estimated 450 people watched the funeral that began shortly
before noon at the 11-acre Antietam National Cemetery near
Sharpsburg where the remains of nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   ``I've done re-enactments, but to see it for real just sent
shivers up and down my spine,'' said Blake Magner, 39, of Westmont,
N.J.
   More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed,
wounded or missing after the battle, which ended Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee's two attempts to push the war northward. The battle
is described as the single bloodiest day of the war.
   The remains of the four soldiers were sealed in a canister inside
a plain, pine coffin that was lowered into the ground near the
graves of other Irish Brigade soldiers.
   They were with regiments that charged the Confederate line Sept.
17, 1862, and were killed by rifle fire. Researchers speculated that
the men's skulls and leg and arm bones were removed from the
battleground in 1865 or 1866 under a federal program to re-inter
Union dead at the cemetery. The rest of their bodies remained
untouched until March 1988 when they were found by a group using
metal detectors.
   ``We brought the remains home, but it bothered us that we had
human remains,'' said Dave Bebenroth, an elementary school teacher
from Strongsville, Ohio, who was with the group that discovered the
remains.
   About a month after the discovery, they decided to turn the
remains over to the National Park Service, which manages Antietam
National Battlefield.
   Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the
soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other was
about 45 years old.
   Earlier in the day, the re-enactors representing the 28th
Massachusetts and the 93rd Pennsylvania regiments gathered for a
Roman Catholic Mass at ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road in the middle
of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for nearly four
hours that day.
   After the Mass, the soldiers marched a mile from Bloody Lane to
the cemetery where two buglers played ``Taps.'' The remains were
buried with a clump of turf and a rock from Ireland.

<HEAD>Hodel Only Attacks Democrats Backing Bill, Not Republicans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel is waging a
letter-writing campaign harshly critical of House Democrats
supporting legislation to protect a national battleground, but
Republicans backing the same bill are noticeably absent from his
target list.
   A spokesman for Hodel said Thursday that the only reason 29
Republican co-sponsors of the bill escaped his scorn is that the
targets were selected in ``haphazard'' fashion.
   Letters sent by Hodel to 13 newspapers in the home districts of
the Democrats say they should be ``ashamed'' of themselves for
backing a ``ludicrous'' plan to protect the Manassas National
Battlefield Park from nearby development.
   Hodel opposes the bill drafted by Reps. Michael Andrews,
D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that would require the Interior
Department to acquire land now owned by a developer who plans a
shopping center, office buildings and residential units next to the
Civil War battlefield in Virginia.
   Critics say the massive development would destroy the
still-rustic feeling of the 4,600-acre battleground.
   Interior Department spokesman David Prosperi confirmed Thursday
that seven House Democrats had been singled out in letters by
Hodel, but denied that the secretary was targeting only Democrats.
   ``The selection was done in a very haphazard manner,'' Prosperi
said. ``If we had had time, we would have sent (letters) to
everyone _ Republicans and Democrats.''
   Prosperi said letters from Hodel criticizing the measure were
sent to 13 newspapers in the congressional districts of Andrews and
Mrazek, as well as Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Georgia, Bill
Richardson of New Mexico, James Clarke of North Carolina, Robert
Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, Jim Slattery of Kansas and Barbara
Kennelly of Connecticut.
   The letters were published in some of the papers in late May and
throughout June.
   In a letter to the Houston Chronicle, which appeared on May 27,
Hodel wrote: ``Andrews ought to be ashamed of himself because he is
playing politics with the future of Manassas Battlefield. It is
easy enough to grab an issue in Washington in order to gain media
attention, but the congressman's idea that the solution here is to
buy that land adjacent to the battlefield ... is ludicrous.''
   Nearly identical language, substituting only the name of the
congressman, appeared in the June 9 editions of Long Island Newsday
(published in Mrazek's district), the June 16 issues of the Atlanta
Daily World (Lewis' district), and the June 28 editions of the
Wisconsin State Journal (Kastenmeier's district).
   ``It's clear that Mr. Hodel's actions have become extremely
partisan,'' said Mrazek. ``I found the harshness of the letter
surprising.''
   While both Andrews and Mrazek were lambasted by Hodel,
Republican co-sponsors of their bill from neighboring congressional
districts escaped the interior secretary's scorn.
   Hodel favors a plan that would allow the shopping mall to be
built next to the battlefield park, but would close two roads
running through the battlefield to reduce the effect of traffic
heading to and from the complex.
   The development-control bill has 200 co-sponsors, including 29
Republicans. The Associated Press contacted 25 of the Republicans,
all of whom said newspapers in their districts had not printed
letters from Hodel.
   The letter-writing campaign especially angered Andrews, since
two Republican congressmen from districts adjacent to his Houston
district co-sponsored the legislation but were not singled out by
Hodel.
   ``Jack Fields (a Republican congressman from Houston) feels
strongly about this issue, but Hodel didn't mention him,'' Andrews
said. ``The secretary of the interior does not serve himself well
when he uses a blistering attack on people who disagree with him.
It's disappointing.''

   Senior congressional tax negotiators are
demanding that the federal government seize 540 acres of the
northern Virginia countryside to block construction of a shopping
mall on the spot where Gen. Robert E. Lee led one of the bloodiest
battles of the Civil War.
   The negotiators, who are seeking compromise on competing House
and Senate versions of a catchall tax bill, agreed Thursday night
to include a requirement that the land be annexed into Manassas
National Battlefield Park, 30 miles west of Washington.
   Leaders of the Senate-House conference committee, hoping to wrap
up work on the bill today, also agreed Thursday to provisions:
   _Imposing limited economic sanctions against Iraq in protest of
that nation's use of poison gas against thousands of members of its
Kurdish minority.
   The sanctions would prohibit export of munitions and
high-technology equipment to Iraq and require U.S. representatives
to oppose lending to Iraq by the World Bank and other international
organizations. If the president has evidence at year-end that the
use of chemical weapons is continuing, he would have to impose
tougher sanctions that could include a cutoff of import-export
credit and barring Iraqi imports into the United States.
   _Giving freelance writers, photographers and artists relief from
a part of the 1986 tax-overhaul law. Under the new provision, they
could deduct certain expenses of producing a book, painting or
photographs before the works started generating income.
   _Increasing, to 33.75 cents per mile, the mileage allowance
given rural mail carriers who drive their own cars on their routes.
Most people who use their car in business get only 22.5 cents a
mile.
   _Removing restrictions on the amount of long-term bonds the
Treasury Department may issue at interest rates above 4.25 percent.
   Agreements on the provisions were reached by Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee; Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance
revenue subcommittee; and the senior Republicans on the two
committees, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   The agreements are subject to approval by a majority of the
other negotiators, but aides said they expect no problem.
   The chief purpose of the differing bills is to fix hundreds of
errors and ambiguities in the new tax law enacted in 1986. The
measures have been expanded to carry scores of relatively minor tax
benefits and the tax increases necessary to pay for them. The
Senate version also includes a ``bill of rights'' to help taxpayers
who face enforcement or collections actions by the Internal Revenue
Service.
   ``We made a lot of progress. We are doing very well,'' Baucus
said at the end of Thursday's negotiations.
   Added Rostenkowski: ``We've got $7 billion'' worth of tax
benefits in the House bill and ``the Senate's got $3 billion. It
(the final version) will be some place in the middle.''
   The provision requiring the taking of a portion of the site
where the Second Battle of Manassas was fought in August 1862 was
added to the tax bill only because sponsors saw no other way of
getting it enacted into law this year. The courts would decide how
much owners of the land are paid; the Reagan administration, which
opposes the plan, estimates the cost at $50 million.
   Historians say that is a small price to pay, but the
administration insists the same point could be made by taking only
80 acres at considerably less cost. Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
offered the 80-acre provision to the Senate but lost when Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., on a 50-25 vote, won approval to take the full 540
acres.
   Warner's amendment would have allowed construction of houses and
some commercial development on the remainder of the plot; only a
mall would have been prohibited.
   Sixteen thousand troops were killed or wounded during a 48-hour
fight on the site.

   Flames from 23,110 candles illuminated
snowy Antietam battlefield, flickering in a holiday tribute to each
soldier killed, wounded or missing on the bloodiest day of the
Civil War.
   The candles, burning inside sand-filled brown paper bags,
emitted faint light at dusk Sunday. When darkness fell, a trumpeter
played taps and 2,826 automobiles began a slow procession through
4.5 miles of the battlefield of rolling hills 70 miles west of
Baltimore.
   ``You actually had a sense of beings _ spirits,'' John Gress, a
Waynesboro, Pa., retiree said. ``In one place, someone placed a
candle so somehow it glistened on a tree covered with ice. It was
unbelievable.''
   More men were killed or wounded at Antietam on Sept. 17, 1862,
than on any other single day in American military history. Union
casualties were 12,410 and Confederate 10,700.
   ``It's a memorial and Christmas is the season of lights. We just
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' said Richard
Rambur, superintendent of the national battlefield.
   ``When you were placing the candles you'd wonder who might have
fallen on the spot where you were putting one,'' said Dan Weiss of
Sharpsburg, one of an estimated 400 volunteers who distributed and
lit the candles.
   It took at least 30 minutes to drive through the park to see the
candles glowing under a starless sky. Four cannons, black
silhouettes against the sky, were embraced by the lights, many
standing in rows like the headstones at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of
Antietam, which was the climax of the first of Gen. Robert E. Lee's
two attempts to carry the war into the North. The battle also gave
President Lincoln an opportunity to issue the Emancipation
Proclamation, which freed the slaves in 1863.
   ``I was a medical officer in Vietnam where the American casualty
count was in the mid-50,000 range, and that was over a long period
of time,'' National Park Service director James M. Ridenour said.
``When you stand here and realize 23,000-plus within eyesight in
one day _ it's breathtaking.''
   The Rev. Richard Hembrock, a Lutheran minister in Sharpsburg,
said: ``People will be able to see how more than 23,000 candles
relate to lives out here. It will be a chance to reflect what we
fought for and what we believe in.''

<HEAD>Access Roads: A New Battle at Gettysburg</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the battle of Devil's Den, pitting
tourist convenience against the National Park Service's desire to
curtail traffic through the Gettysburg battlefield.
   The park service has proposed eliminating two access roads, as
well as part of a third, to the historic Devil's Den area of the
Pennsylvania battlefield.
   The idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original
appearance and to halt an erosion problem at Devil's Den, an area
of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot, National Park Service
spokesman Robert Davidson said Wednesday.
   The debate moved here last week when Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,
presented to park service Director William Penn Mott a petition
containing signatures of more than 11,000 people who oppose the
plan.
   Mott has agreed to personally inspect the site as part of a
review of the plan, according to park service spokesman George
Berklacy.
   ``There was a road constructed in about 1904 during a period
when people were visiting on horses and buggies,'' Davidson said.
``Since then, the response to more and larger vehicles has been
more pavement, and we just feel that the time has come to take a
new direction.''
   But the Devil's Den Access Committee brought maps and a slide
show last week to document their concerns to the park service that
the plan would be counterproductive.
   Phil Cole, a battlefield guide who heads the citizen protest,
said Wednesday that he fears people would have to walk to Devil's
Den from a planned new parking lot that may be too small to
accommodate visitors.
   The walk is three-quarters of a mile, round trip.
   ``People are not all joggers or athletic. Plus, there is
inclement weather, and hot days,'' he said.
   Traffic, he said, will be diverted to other roads that will
become more congested.
   An access road would be made available so that the disabled
could be driven to the site, the park service said.
   The Gettysburg National Military Battlefield has been holding
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the bloody Civil War battle
on July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were
killed or wounded on the battlefield, later the scene of Abraham
Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address.

   Bones, buttons and bullets uncovered at
recently discovered graves near the Antietam battleground in
Western Maryland are providing new details about a pivotal Civil
War battle that included the bloodiest day in American military
history.
   Researchers for the Smithsonian Institution and the U.S.
National Park Service say the graves are of four members of the
famed Irish Brigade from New York.
   The four died Sept. 17, 1862, as wave after wave of Irish
Brigade soldiers smashed against the Confederate line and were cut
down by rifle fire on a day that saw 24,000 soldiers, Union and
Confederate, fall in battle.
   Examination of a shoulder blade and teeth found in one of the
sites shows that a 45-year-old man helped lead the Union charge.
   ``This gentleman was in the front rank as the Irish brigade
tried to dislodge the Confederate troops on that day,'' Stephen
Potter, an archaeologist for the U.S. National Park Service, said
at news conference Wednesday.
   Potter said discovery of ``buck and ball'' ammunition indicates
that the Irish Brigade was not well-armed for the battle it met
that day.
   The Irishmen, he said, were carrying smooth-bore long guns
loaded to fire a marble-sized ball and two buckshot pellets.
   ``These were, in effect, combat shotguns,'' he said, that killed
best at close range.
   Based on the Confederate slugs that killed the 45-year-old New
Yorker, said Potter, the rebels were using rifled long guns that
were lethal from long distances. As a result, he said, the
Confederates were able to kill the Union troops at 200 yards, long
before the Yankees could charge to within the effective range of
their weapons.
   The burial sites were found in April by three amateur
archaeologists searching a field near the boundaries of the
federally owned battleground near Hagerstown, Md. A team from the
Smithsonian and the Park Service excavated the site and sifted tons
of clay soil to find artifacts.
   Dennis F. Frye, Park Service historian, said the Battle of
Antietam, named after the creek which flows through the grounds, is
considered by many to be pivotal in the Civil War. Though it ended
in a draw, Frye said the battle halted the South's first invasion
of the North, persuaded France and England to withhold recognition
of the Confederate government, and encouraged President Lincoln a
few weeks later to issue the Emancipation Proclamation that freed
the slaves.
   The battle also marked the first time that the Union army
retained command of a battleground after a clash with Southern
troops.
   ``It was the bloodiest single day in United States military
history,'' said Frye. ``In 12 hours of fighting, there were four
times more casualties than on D-Day,'' the Allied invasion of
Europe in World War II.
   The battle, which Confederates named the Battle of Sharpsburg _
after the nearest village _ pitted 40,000 Confederate troops under
Gen. Robert E. Lee against 46,000 troops of the Federal Army of the
Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.
   Though undefeated, Lee withdrew the next day across the Potomac
River into Virginia. McClellan, who had 40,000 troops in reserve,
later was criticized for not attempting to the block the Southern
withdrawal.
   The attack by the Irish brigade came at midday. The Union troops
were sent against a Confederate line dug in along a sunken road.
Within a few hours, bodies were piled like cordwood and that small
road became known to history as ``the bloody lane.''
   Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Natural History
museum, said the recently discovered shoulder blade showed evidence
of arthritis and that teeth from the same body were heavily worn.
This suggests, he said, that the soldier was about 45 years of age.
   ``This makes him somewhat unique,'' said Owsley, since most of
the soldiers in the Irish Brigade were young volunteers. Because of
the unusual age, he said there is a chance that the middle-aged
soldier may be identified by name.
   At the same site, researchers also found three Confederate rifle
slugs. From their position, Potter said it was obvious that the
45-year-old New Yorker was hit in the chest by all three slugs.
   The site also included a cross, a religious medal, a cuff button
bearing the New York state crest and a blouse button of the type
used by the Irish Brigade.

<HEAD>Civil War Interest Thrives, 125 Years After Appomattox</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>

   When Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's troops chased
the Confederate government from Richmond, a slave named James
Wilder hid in a tobacco silo.
   ``He almost suffocated in that silo,'' recalls the slave's
grandson, Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, recounting the story
passed down through his father.
   Instead, James Wilder emerged to find himself suddenly a free
man, and the city, which had been bombarded for months, wrapped in
flames.
   Grant rode on 95 miles to Appomattox, where Gen. Robert E. Lee
surrendered the South's main army seven days later on April 9,
1865, and Wilder went on to beget the father of the nation's first
black elected governor.
   Though 125 years have passed since the end of the Civil War, it
still is ingrained in the consciences of many Southern natives.
   Stories about the war are reaching more people than ever through
a growing number of battle re-enactments, battlefield tours, books
and specialty magazines, and through the celebrated movie
``Glory,'' about the Union's first black regiment.
   ``There are so many events being re-enacted that we can't keep
track of them,'' said David Roth, editor of Blue and Gray, a
magazine with the motto ``For Those Who Still Hear The Guns.''
   The regional and racial divisions exacerbated by the ``War of
Northern Aggression,'' the term still used by some southerners, are
beginning to close, and the symbols of the Old South are becoming
more anachronistic.
   Trucks with Confederate flags on the rear windows and bumper
stickers reading ``Forget, Hell!'' and ``The South Will Rise
Again'' are becoming endangered species, but the ironies of the
South in transition still pervade Richmond, the capital of the
Confederacy.
   Residents celebrate the birthdays of Lee, Gen. Stonewall Jackson
and Martin Luther King Jr. on the same day.
   Mary Sue Terry, the state's first female attorney general, is
fighting a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking to force
Virginia Military Institute to admit women. VMI cadets fought to
secede from the federal government, and many of the southern
generals were graduates.
   One of only two buildings in Richmond's commercial district that
survived Grant's 10-month siege is a granite structure that housed
offices of the Confederate government. Occupying the building now
is the federal court, the institution that helped rid the South of
segregation.
   Across the Martin Luther King Bridge and a block to the left are
the Museum of the Confederacy and the Confederate White House, now
surrounded by high-rise university buildings.
   The museum's sign-in sheet is replete with the names of visitors
from cities to the north, as well as Canada and Europe.
   Attendance never has been better, spokeswoman Barbara Hyde said.
   ``There always has been a high interest in the Civil War, but in
the past four years, it has increased tremendously,'' she said.
   On Richmond's Monument Avenue, two black women and a white man
who attend a karate class nearby practice their moves at the base
of a towering statue of Lee on horseback.
   In between kick punches, Carrie Britton relates how she cried
when she saw the movie ``Glory'' and only then learned there were
black soldiers who died fighting for the Union. ``There was a white
woman who made a point of holding the door for me when I was
leaving the theater,'' Ms. Britton said. ``She was touched, too.''
   The provocation for the Civil War was at first largely the
labor-intensive South's objection to tariffs favored by the
industrialized North, although the issue of slavery bitterly
divided the regions. Only later did the focus shift to the
constitutional issues of secession and the abolition of slavery.
   Those issues led to the poignant human drama of brother fighting
brother, father fighting son and friend fighting friend,
particularly in border states.
   The cost of the war was tremendous. More than 600,000 Union and
Confederate soldiers died over the four-year period, nearly
equaling the number of Americans killed in all other wars combined.
   Because of the high number of casualties, almost everyone who
had forebears in America in 1861 can associate with the war, said
Ed Bearss, chief historian of the National Park Service.
   Charles Bryan, director of the Virginia Historical Society, said
he and other Civil War scholars on the lecture circuit are being
asked to explain why people continue to be fascinated by the
struggle 125 years later.
   To answer, he pulls a cone-shaped rifle bullet from his pocket,
a Minie ball recovered at a battlefield outside Richmond that's now
a residential development.
   ``A young boy brought it to the Historical Society,'' Bryan
said. ``One of the reasons the war is so fascinating is that it
happened in our own backyard, both literally and figuratively.''
   The war destroyed the economic and social system of the South.
The 12 years of Reconstruction that followed, a period in which the
11 secessionist states were regarded as conquered territories,
solidified the region's antagonism toward the North.
   ``I don't think there would have been a solid South had there
not been what southerners saw as a harsh Reconstruction,'' Bearss
said.
   ``The feelings were so visceral that it went past just
disagreement on political ideologues,'' Wilder said. ``Rather, it
was almost a lifestyle to be different. The only thing that can
change that is the passage of time.''
   An increasingly mobile society and the commonality of mass
communications also are softening the divisions, Bryan said.
   ``Little by little, the separate identities of the North and
South are beginning to change,'' he said.
   Bryan said the lingering prejudices became apparent to him when
the topic of a speech he gave on the commemoration of Lee's
birthday _ the 18 native Virginians who served as generals in the
Union army _ was publicized in advance.
   ``I got angry phone calls from people who said, `How dare you
talk about Yankee generals on General Lee's birthday?' '' he said.
``The Civil War still lives in the minds of many people. It will
never be forgotten.''
