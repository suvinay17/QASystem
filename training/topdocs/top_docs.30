CYBERSPACE: FIRST STEPS edited by Michael Benedikt MIT Press Pounds 19.95,
436 pages
LOST IN Cyberspace? Then blame Descartes: 'I have, on the one hand, a clear
and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and, on the
other hand, a distinct idea of my body as an extended, non-thinking thing;
it is therefore certain that I am truly distinct from my body, and can exist
without it' (Meditations, 1642). Three hundred and fifty years on,
technology has proved this almost instinct almost true. Leibniz arrived in
1666 with his idea of 'electric language' for logical reasoning outside
language, and the coordinates for Cyberspace were set.
Cyberspace: First Steps, is a difficult, technical and interdisciplinary
collection of 15 essays from architects, philosophers, Sci-Fi writers and
intellectual historians. It gives the history of a technology that will
alter our lives next century, although no one knows exactly how. The essays'
limitations - obscurity, obtuseness and jargon - are entirely consistent
with confusions surrounding VR technology. No one knows what kind of world
the technology is driving us towards.
The history, however, is plain enough. After written texts (around 1600)
came the electronic revolution (after 1900) and the age of information
technology (after 1960). In 1984, the Sci-Fi writer William Gibson coined
the term 'Cyberspace' in Neuromancer, a bewildering journey through a matrix
of 'collective hallucination.' Instead of sitting at the computer keyboard
controlling information, Gibson's characters were inside the matrix. They
were information.
The current pop-example of Cyberspace is the new 'Virtual Reality' (VR)
technology. This lets a computer's users represent themselves in three
dimensions and wander around with other bits of electronic information in
the computer's memory; this technology has become useful for architects,
designers and fire fighters as well as games-players. But Cyberspace is more
than that; it is the place where all information, visualised spatially,
moves along electronic networks between users; the place where data is
collected and robots controlled remotely; the place where the mind floats
free of the body.
So, what does living in Cyberspace mean? Many people are already there. With
portable PCs and modems, we are turned into nomads who are always in touch.
Within the permanently ephemeral world created by digital television, PCs
and high bandwidth cable or radio-frequency networks, we build structures of
information like data visualisation, user networks or graphic user
interfaces. These structures exist in the country called Cyberspace: bank
accounts, credit ratings, company files.
The rules of evolution for Cyberspace have yet to be defined. That
uncertainty makes these essays an adventure in honest perplexity. The
Cyberspace revolution has spawned a new commentator, the Cyber-architect,
who unites (as traditional architects do) the disciplines of design,
technology and sociology. The language which explains Cyberspace is
overwhelmingly architectural: dimensions, structures, habitations. But there
is no obvious 'natural space' equivalent for motion or physical interaction
in Cyberspace. Those who write about it in this collection are mining in
unknown seams with an occasional pit-prop and no illumination from the
outside world.
Now, Cyberspace research is beginning to call into question our very notions
of 'space', 'intelligence' and 'perception'; so these essays are a taxing
excursion in philosophical and semantic thinking. The contributors require a
highly eclectic knowledge from their reader, who is expected to be familiar
with such disparates as Baudrillard, Habermas, Lacan, CS Lewis, le
Corbusier, McLuhan, Merleau-Ponty and Gerard de Nerval. Michael Benedikt's
editing is rather too light for the non-specialist, but then Cyberspace
involves enough disciplines to make a nonsense of specialism.
Since no process of logical reasoning can add to the information which its
founding axioms contain, nor to the observations from which it proceeds
(information encoded in a molecule of DNA or an architect's blueprint), and
since Cyberspace has yet to decide on its logical processes and its axioms,
this is a fascinating area which allows every intellectual discipline a fair
shout. Few academic subjects are confident enough not to exclude others
these days.
Perhaps because Cyberspace is a country of the mind, the laws of the
imagination will turn out to be the processes which govern the new
electronic frontiers. As Dr Johnson said, 'Were it not for imagination, sir,
a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Technology: Superhighway in need of a route - Geof
Wheelwright meets the man who coined the term 'cyberspace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The technologists, politicians, and policy thinktanks have all had their say
on the information superhighway. Most agree that it will not only be a place
to work, but also to play. Films, books and music are all expected to become
widely accessible 'on-line' as the rush towards the information highway
becomes a traffic jam.
But what of the artists whose work is supposed to become a featured
attraction on this journey? Aside from the announced corporatist objectives
of movie moguls such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, little has been
heard from the artistic (creative) community.
A fresh perspective comes from William Gibson, the Vancouver-based author
who coined the term 'cyberspace' in the mid-1980s in his best-selling
science fiction novel Neuromancer.
Gibson says the whole notion of an information highway is misconceived. He
is firmly of the opinion that all the hoopla is nothing more than an attempt
by industry to sell us things we don't want and by governments to be
involved where they really aren't needed. 'My feeling is that it all
originates from an ad agency somewhere - which is basically the US
government,' he says wryly. 'The notion of an information highway is a bogus
metaphor - what they are offering is a lot more like a (shopping) mall.'
Gibson also believes that business people and politicians have no concept of
why the Internet - the best example yet of a so-called 'information highway'
in action - is such a success, with an estimated 30m users worldwide.
'The Internet is strange. It doesn't make any money. It is transnational,
beyond anyone's control. It is the great anarchist event,' says Gibson. 'If
what these guys (in governments and industry) are calling the information
highway is an infrastructure upgrade (to fibre-optic cabling and high-speed
switching systems) that's great.' But if they want to create a system that
is controlled and generates business 'it won't work,' he warns.
He doubts that the information highway will be commercially viable until
whatever is behind the growth of the Internet is better understood. 'Is it
an historical anomaly, or is there some inherent value in the technology
used to create it?' he asks rhetorically.
Gibson says that the mystery of the Internet's success is likely to prevent
it from being completely 'hijacked' by commercial interests. 'The commercial
interests are looking at this as a medium like television,' he notes. 'But
it is actually much more like a language than a traditional medium of
communication.'
Gibson says it is the universality of the Internet that makes it similar to
a language - it is open to everyone and used by all manner of people. This
universality is evident when you start browsing around the discussion areas
 -which include everything from pornography to religious fundamentalism to
topics in the news.
The Internet also provides the means to break down government-imposed
barriers. During the darkest days of the 1991 failed coup attempt against
Mikhail Gorbachev in the old Soviet Union, for example, it was the Internet
that provided an international route out for many messages about what was
really happening.
Despite its usefulness as a mechanism for free speech, Gibson says it is
still hard to define what anybody means when they talk about an information
highway. He suggests that the technology underlying any 'information
highway' is currently akin to the many mechanical devices designed in the
Victorian era to achieve cinema-like effects before the first really
effective uses of film technology arrived.
He adds that this is partly because the potential of the various converged
technologies is not really apparent until the convergence takes place - and
suggests that if you look back to the turn of the century and read the
Victorians' visions of what life would be like in 2000, you get some idea of
how the public fascination with the possibilities of emerging technologies
often outstrips any kind of realistic analysis of what the future might
hold.

THE VIRTUAL COMMUNITY by Howard Rheingold Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 16.99, 25
pages
Three years ago, Senator Al Gore's High performance Computing Act was signed
into law by President Bush. It outlined Gore's vision for 'highways of the
mind' to be mapped by federal research and development and brought to
citizens by private enterprise. Like the railways in the 19th- and the
telephone system in the 20th-century, there is a technological revolution
afoot which stretches wherever a computer can be linked to others via
satellite. The global village is becoming a global desk.
Howard Rheingold has written another first-rate book on computer technology.
In 1991 his Virtual Reality was a clear, comprehensive guide to the
technical and moral issues surrounding the three-dimensional computer-made
worlds we are making in research, business and entertainment.
Now, Rheingold has done the same for computer networks in The Virtual
Community. Using a communication programme and a telephone line, Rheingold
is a world electronic citizen, in touch with thousands of others through a
series of local and interconnecting networks which reaches from home in
California to wherever there is anyone to speak to him.
He calls it The Net, an informal term for the coterie of computer networks
using computer-mediated commun-ications to link people around the world into
public discussions; there is a directory called The Matrix (John Quarterman,
1990); and the shared computer space-time in which networkers communicate is
called Cyberspace, broadly speaking, an electronic version of an
18th-century coffee house. Rheingold envisages an 'online metropolis' where
you make friends (irrespective of race, creed, colour, gender or capability)
according to shared interests rather than chance proximity.
Rheingold has chapters on his own local network in San Francisco, on daily
life in cyberspace, on pornographie in the Parisian Minitel system, and on
online activism in the computer hacking community. He offers printouts of
online discussions, and assembles a credible picture of what it means to
spend two hours a day on a computer talking to other people. His light
liberal touch guides the book through electronic activism and
'Disinformacy', drawing on McLuhan, Habermas, Foucault and Bentham. It makes
a stimulating read. The style is lucid and the issues lively.
Rheingold makes big promises: the Net - 'an ecosystem of subcultures' - will
change our perceptions of ourselves, offer the chance of 'many to many'
communication (opposed to TV's 'few to one'), and alter our models of
representative democracy. Some of these may be partially true for the
computer-literate. The larger questions are those of ownership and control.
The world's first Network was the US Defense Department Advance Research
Projects Agency's ARPANET, designed in the 1970s to allow researchers to
operate computers at a distance.
The Net is fast, cheap, widely available and, commercially and politically,
up for grabs. It breaks down the boundaries between professional and amateur
by making information accessible to a range of people; universities are
already reverting to the 18th century by recognising they have no monopoly
on academic and intellectual property, and the Net will push that
development further, undermining institutions based merely on knowledge.
What emerges from Rheingold's excellent book is a range of information and
issues shaped for the non-specialist; it is deftly written and scrupulously
precise. Rheingold makes space for his wry wit and his social concerns.
Secker and Warburg have yet to publish Virtual Community electronically; it
should be available online within a decade or so.

<LEADPARA>  "It is quite a cloudy area," Harvard University professor Laurence Tribe says
of the troublesome intersection of cyberspace and the U.S. Constitution.;  
Tribe, one of the nation's foremost legal scholars, fears that constitutional
lines that have been meticulously drawn over two centuries -- protecting free
speech and free press, among other rights -- might "warp or vanish" when
stretched to cover the unwieldy realm of electronic reality.  </LEADPARA>

IS FREE SPEECH SECURED ON-LINE?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Mapping "the text and structure of our Constitution onto the texture and
topography of cyberspace" promises to be one of the great constitutional
challenges of our times, he told the First Conference on Computers, Freedom
and Privacy, last March. The problem: In all of its acclaimed wisdom, the
Constitution "tends to carve up the social, legal and political universe along
the lines of physical place or temporal proximity." Cyberspace, on the other
hand, defies physical dimensions and time constraints.;   Is 27th amendment
needed?; "These are things that have not been thoroughly ventilated or
litigated," Tribe says. Although the First Amendment should prove adequate in
resolving these issues, a 27th amendment legally configuring cyberspace isn't
out of the question, he adds.;   Meanwhile, more computer network users
believe their rights have been abused and more network purveyors feel they've
been miscast as Bill of Rights villains. At the heart of the debate is the
distinction between the private and public nature of electronic bulletin
boards and the computer networks that host them.;   What's subject to
censorship; A publicly supported network, one subsidized by tax dollars for
instance, would be subject to constitutional guarantees, says Lance Rose, a
New York attorney specializing in high-technology law who is revising the
coming edition of "SYSLAW: The System Operator's Legal Guide." But in the
privately owned networks, "users sign on with a contract, and there is no
constitutional freedom of speech, so censorship in those cases is perfectly
legal . . . at least that's how it looks at this juncture.";   But as private
networks "increasingly occupy larger public roles," Tribe said, "in terms of
legal doctrine that has been evolving since the 1970s . . . the user could
assert First Amendment rights against the network or system.";   One view
contends that the electronic arena already has taken on public powers of
virtual "governments." Inasmuch as the networks "create their own rules of
admission and access and expulsion," says Tribe, and even operate beyond
international boundaries and the laws of some nations, they may be outgrowing
their private status and ripening for regulation, just as the Federal
Communications Commission regulates television and radio broadcasts.;   "If
you get too public, you do have the government involved, and First Amendment
concerns would rise to the surface," Rose says. "If it is a public message or
information system, then it starts to look like a "geographic public place."
And, as we know, there are (constitutional) provisions for people to have free
speech in public places.";   One precedent is the Supreme Court's 1980
Pruneyard Shopping Center decision that upheld freedom of speech at a public
gathering place even though it was a privately owned shopping mall in
Campbell.;   "It is hard to say if anything in the bulletin-board world has
reached that level, where it is private but somehow takes on a public
quality," Rose says. "Possibly in the future, large systems will gain that
status.";   Analogies for computer networks don't stop at shopping malls.
Depending on who's making the comparison, they've ranged from soapboxes to
bookstores to Swiss banks. Prodigy executives liken their role to that of a
newspaper editor who doesn't print every article submitted and edits letters
to be published.;   "It is called editorial discretion," argued a Prodigy
spokesman in a New York Times commentary piece responding to criticism of the
network's silencing last year of rebellious users. "And it does not limit
speech in any constitutional sense.";   Most network managers are at least
comfortable, if not satisfied, with that model. Cliff Figallo, managing
director of The Well, a Sausalito-based network, says, "Most of the legal
conjecture at this point guesses it would be treated the same as the print
media, and we try to play it safe in that regard. We are tempted to press some
of these legal issues, but we feel we are more valuable being on-line than
off-line in court.";   But Rose says even that seemingly logical model isn't
without contention: "It raises the concept of the press and freedom of the
press to a new level in American history."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     So, without drawing any conclusions from the data, here are some
suggestions for reading material and gifts:;   "Cyberspace: First Steps"
($24.95, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Boston) is an anthology
of essays and musings on one of the most exciting, exotic and least understood
frontiers of computing. The term cyberspace refers to the ephemeral otherworld
that exists in the global electronic web of computer and communications
networks.;   Michael Benedikt, a professor of architecture at the University
of Texas and editor of the book, refers to cyberspace as an "elusive and
future thing," and it remains elusive at the conclusion of the book. Yet the
descriptions offered in the book are compelling. The writers work at companies
and institutions such as International Business Machines, Electronic Data
Systems, Texas Instruments, Bull Worldwide Information Systems, Stanford and
MIT.;   Nearer on the horizon, and also promising rewards for business, are
expert systems. "The Rise of the Expert Company" ($19.95, Times Books, New
York City), by artificial-intelligence experts Edward Feigenbaum, Pamela
McCorduck and H. Penny Nii, is subtitled "How Visionary Companies Are Using
Artificial Intelligence to Achieve Higher Productivity and Profits.";  
Artificial intelligence is one of those unfortunate terms that promises more
than it delivers. Computers are not yet "smart," but they can serve as
repositories for the collected wisdom and experience of senior executives.;  
Others, then, can extract the intelligence and apply it to problems that range
from product development and administration to manufacturing. A new breed of
computer experts called knowledge engineers is creating a form of artificial
intelligence known as expert systems.;   Expert systems allow companies, not
just individual executives, to work smarter, and among the companies profiled
are Du Pont, Fujitsu, Navistar, Northrop, Canon, IBM and American Express.;  
And then there is a book for executives and dreamers who are ready to go
beyond toe-dipping and take the plunge.;   "High-Tech Ventures, The Guide for
Entrepreneurial Success" ($29.95, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading,
Mass.), is by C. Gordon Bell, with John E. McNamara. Bell, a scientist and
engineer, worked 23 years as a research and development director at Digital
Equipment Corp. before becoming a principal in more than 20 high-tech start-up
companies. Some succeeded, some failed. The lessons from each are laid down
here.;   Anyone thinking of starting a high-tech company, or investing in one,
will find this book valuable. Bell dissects start-ups such as Ovation,
Analytica, Cirrus Logic, Thinking Machines, Apollo and Sun, with
behind-the-scenes insights into the heady world of high tech.;   "High-Tech
Ventures" concludes with a look ahead, and its predictions are provocative:
The United States will continue to lead the world in inventiveness; the
Japanese will dominate every market through their strength in innovation.;  
One area where American innovation may save the day is in computer
programming, especially in an emerging field known as object-oriented
programming.;   "Object Oriented Technology, a Manager's Guide" ($19.50,
Addison-Wesley, paperback), by David A. Taylor, is one of the first accessible
guides to the most important trend in software development. Taylor, a
management consultant, has a knack for explaining highly technical concepts in
a way that executives, managers and other non-programmers can grasp. The
simple diagrams and illustrations make it virtually painless.;  
Object-oriented programming (OOP) holds the promise of making it easier for
executives to get the data they need, and it promises to allow businesses to
construct software applications in a fraction of the time now needed. It does
so by using software "packets" that contain data and the instructions
necessary to act on the data.;   Only a few personal computer software
companies, notably Borland International Inc., are pursuing OOP relentlessly.  </TEXT>

CYBERIA: LIFE IN THE TRENCHES OF HYPERSPACE by Douglas Rushkoff Flamingo
Pounds 6.99, 320pp
The Utopian urge has been with us since Cro-Magnon man started bumping his
head on the cave ceiling, so it is hardly surprising that some people
maintain that quantum advances in information technology might give birth to
a vastly better society.
The young American journalist Douglas Rushkoff is such a believer. His
lively and informed book is an ode to computers and fibre optics, a glowing
map of a brave new world called Cyberspace.
Rushkoff defines Cyberspace as a 'consensual hallucination accessed through
the computer' - hence, anything from two people speaking by satellite link,
to a boy wandering deep in the latest virtual reality program.
For Rushkoff, Cyberspace is a realm ripe with possibilities for new human
organisation and development. It is a place potentially free of governmental
oversight and personal neuroses, where human impulses can be infinitely
perfected with the help of the microchip.
The author is at his most convincing while charting recent advances in
hardware technology and showing how these have benefited the human
imagination. For Rushkoff, the existence of a 'datasphere', where a large
number of people are plugged into one another's computers, provides an
imaginative arena of unbridled possibility.
He posits a world where business meetings and classrooms no longer require
physical proximity, where correspondence occurs without delay, where news
can be transmitted without need for media conglomerates. Rushkoff
breathlessly scans the future horizon, catching glimpses of scenarios such
as cyber-sex between two people using Virtual Reality software and 'wet',
body-reactive hard-
ware.
It is hard to argue that technology like Video Toasters, which allow us to
'sample' television shows as disc jockeys now do records, and 'wireheading',
hardware that plugs directly into the human brain, promise a whole new way
to work and play.
What Rushkoff seems to have less of a stomach for is the dark side of this
world, the dystopia in which technology is used as a means of repression and
conformity rather than liberation. Believing that 'as computer-networking
technology gets into the hands of more cyberians, historical power centers
are challenged,' he seems to forget that the reason so much power is
centralised is that the people who wield it have a knack of staying one step
ahead of the rest of us. Cyberia's relation to its Soviet namesake may be
more meaningful than just a facile pun. That said, Rushkoff's examination of
the technological aspects of Cyberspace remains essential for those
interested in the subject.
Where the book proves far less effective is in its second part, which deals
with the non-computing side of Cyberia. Smart drugs, house music and
Cyberpunk fiction are all subsumed under a tatty umbrella of New Age
thinking that would have us believe is in some way related to the
information revolution.
Rushkoff's arguments are far from convincing - one need only listen to the
monotonous drone of rave music or the cretinous babble of a 'smart drug'
saleswoman to understand that this is nothing more than warmed-over
hippyism. Rushkoff's prose, so lucid in the early parts of the book, becomes
unmoored and jargon-ridden as he takes us through the poorly-lit labyrinth
of 'neopaganism' and 'technoshamanism'. Where he started off largely
convincing us that a brave new world was being born, we leave the book
thinking that Cyberia is little more than an enclave for the sort of
drop-outs who have always found their utopia in the same place - anywhere
but here.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology: Caught in the web - A new cyberspace
neighbourhood has joined the Internet and traffic is brisk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you thought the Internet was for 'techno-nerds', think again. Over the
past 18 months a vast new array of information resources has been added to
this global computer network that even a novice can navigate.
The World Wide Web (WWW) is the newest and fastest-growing neighbourhood in
cyberspace; a collection of about 10,000 'servers', or database computers,
up from about 3,000 in August with more being added everyday - containing
information on topics as diverse as fly fishing and home brewing to film
reviews and electronic newspapers.
The Web provides a set of standards, or formats, that enable users to access
information files on the Internet. What marks it out from earlier efforts is
its ability to allow users to move easily from relevant information in one
database to linked information in another one - which might be on the far
side of the world. The Internet itself is the network of computers that
exchanges information by using the same interconnection rules.
The Web has a flourishing 'commercial district' as hundreds of companies
begin to promote their wares over the Internet's global links. Most
important, it is the site of the first 'electronic commerce' on the
Internet, which is expected to explode over the next year.
The first filaments of the Web were spun in 1989 at Cern, the European
particle physics laboratory, in a project led by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer
scientist who is known as the 'father' of the WWW.
'The WWW was conceived as a seamless world in which all information, from
any source, can be accessed in a consistent and simple way . . . on any type
of computer, from any country, using one (standard) program,' says
Berners-Lee.
His vision has come close to reality over the past year, largely as a result
of the popularity of Mosaic, a software program that enables computer users
to 'browse' the databases and search swiftly through thousands of on-line
documents. It simplifies the task - a click of the mouse on a link-word in
one document automatically executes computer instructions to take the reader
to another related piece of information, be it text, graphics, sound or
video.
This is a huge improvement over the bewildering mass of different computer
protocols and languages that Internet users faced until recently. In effect,
Mosaic has become a tour guide to cyberspace - a guide that speaks all the
computer languages and knows the best sights.
Developed at the University of Illinois' National Centre for Supercomputing
Applications, Mosaic is available to individual users, via the Internet, at
no charge.
Since May, corporate computer users have purchased more than 10m copies of
an 'enhanced' version of Mosaic from Spyglass, a company set up to
commercialise the university's technology.
Traffic on the WWW is growing so fast that it is difficult to keep pace.
About 30m people are estimated to be using the Internet, with about 1m new
users logging on each month - many of them drawn by interest in the WWW.
Almost anybody can put up a 'home page' on the WWW. The McBryan family of
Boulder, Colorado, for example, claims to be the first home on the
information superhighway. Dad, Mum and the three kids are all wired up to
the Internet. 'What you will find here are prototypes of future infobahn
users,' they say, throwing in some family photos to illustrate their text.
Then there is Hillside Elementary School, in Minnesota, where Mrs Collins'
sixth-grade class project is to create a site on the WWW. Last year, the
third grade (ages 7-8) also participated.
An Intel engineer proudly shows off his contribution to the WWW - mock-up
photos designed to make him look like a felon being booked into jail and
some hyperlinks to discussions of British cars, his hobby.
The friendly feel of the WWW is also, however, making it the ideal locale
for businesses. You can find IBM, AT&amp;T, Ford, Mitsubishi and the Bank of
America on the Web, among many others. Search a bit further and you may find
menus of restaurants in Palo Alto, California, a wedding planning service
called 'Bridesmaid for Windows', a listing of homes for sale in San
Francisco and hundreds of other businesses.
Commercial 'domains', the Internet addresses for groups of users, have
multiplied from about 9,000 in 1991 to well over 20,000. Most are
experimenting on the Internet by posting public information and seeing how
much notice it gets.
A fledgling industry of consulting groups and service organisations is
growing up around the WWW, helping companies to create an on-line presence.
Business interest in the WWW is rapidly shifting, however, towards
electronic commerce. In Silicon Valley, for example, a group of electronics
manufacturers is building CommerceNet, an Internet marketplace for
electronics products.
Intel, one of the participants, predicts that eventually electronic commerce
will eliminate the 'middle men' or distributors that today play a critical
role in delivering all sorts of products to end-users.
The Web is also a new medium for publishing groups, with several newspapers
and magazines already on the Web. HotWired, an electronic version of the
trendy San Francisco high-tech magazine, is a big attraction on the WWW. The
San Jose Mercury News, a pioneer in electronic newspapers publishing with
its 'Mercury Center' on America Online, is also planning an Internet version
on the WWW.
As business interests multiply on the WWW, it is beginning to be seen as a
competitor to commercial on-line services such as Prodigy, Compuserve and
America Online for which users pay subscription plus fees according to how
much time they spend on line. The trend on the WWW, in contrast, is towards
free services supported by advertising revenues.
For the average user with a personal computer and a modem, access to the WWW
is slow. Yet as the availability of high-speed communications lines
increases, and prices decline, the WWW appears set to continue its
exponential growth and to create the much heralded 'information
superhighway' long before predictions of 'movies on demand' and 500 TV
channels come true.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Doing cyber business - Every two minutes a
new user hooks into the Internet, a system that could revolutionise global
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Solo travellers on the Internet 'information highway' are being overtaken by
the digital equivalent of 16-wheel juggernaut trucks, as businesses begin to
transport large quantities of data through cyberspace. The system is being
transformed into a global electronic marketplace that could change the way
world trade is conducted.
The Internet, a global system of computer networks, now links an estimated
2.2m computers and over 25m users in 137 countries. New users are hooking up
at the rate of about one every two minutes.
Originally a US government-funded programme in the late 1960s, to
electronically link researchers at US universities and government
laboratories, the Internet was in theory closed to commercial activity until
about two years ago.
Now companies are rushing to take advantage of the system as a low-cost
route for international electronic mail. Computer companies have led the
way. Digital Equipment, one of the heaviest users, has over 31,000 computers
linked to Internet and exchanges an average of 1.7m e-mail messages per
month with people outside the company.
To date, however, very little commerce is actually being transacted in
cyberspace. Most companies have been reluctant to trust sensitive business
data, purchase orders or credit information to the unregulated network. But
that could be about to change. A group of Silicon Valley companies and
organisations has joined forces in an attempt to pioneer the use of the
Internet as a new medium for trade among high technology companies by
creating an electronic marketplace called CommerceNet.
If successful, this 'could revolutionise both regional and foreign trade',
says Marty Tenenbaum, chief executive of Enterprise Integration Technologies
(EIT), a research firm leading the development of CommerceNet, together with
Stanford University's Center for Information Technology and the Western
Research and Educational Network (West Ren), a non-profit group that
operates the Northern California portion of the Internet.
The CommerceNet consortium is funded by a Dollars 6m US government grant,
through the Department of Commerce' Technology Reinvestment Program which is
being expanded by the Clinton administration as part of its technology
development policy. The group will obtain matching funds from the companies,
state and local agencies that have agreed to sponsor the service.
CommerceNet is tackling the problems that have discouraged companies from
using the Internet for buying and selling goods and services, notably the
complexity of navigating the Internet and lax security.
The first problem can be overcome with a new 'point and click' interface
program called Mosaic, developed by the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Distributed free via the Internet, Mosaic is rapidly gaining popularity as
an easy-to-use method to gain access to information resources on the
Internet.
Mosaic will enable companies to place 'virtual store fronts' on the
Internet. Buyers can tap into these store fronts, browse through catalogues
of products - which may include pictures, diagrams and even video clips -
call up order forms and transmit their orders directly to the seller.
However, security remains a serious concern for business users. The public
network is particularly vulnerable to computer 'crackers', as demonstrated
by a recent rash of password interceptions involving tens of thousands of
Internet users.
To address this problem, EIT is working with RSA Data Security, the leading
US encryption technology company, to develop a 'secure' version of Mosaic.
CommerceNet will provide participants with authentication, authorisation and
data encryption programs so that buyers and sellers can safely exchange
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts, sign
legally enforceable contracts, maintain audit trails, and get paid through
co-operating banks.
Until such software is available, CommerceNet participants will proceed
cautiously. Most say they will provide on-line product catalogues and
literature and enable orders to be placed via the Internet. For now,
however, they will stop short of completing financial transactions.
Nevertheless, CommerceNet is an important testbed for 'commerce in
cyberspace', say participants.
'We expect to gain valuable insights and experience concerning electronic
commerce, and to offer a broad range of business information and services
via CommerceNet,' says Peter Meekin, of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
Hewlett-Packard and other manufacturing companies that are already using
private networks for exchanging order information with their customers and
suppliers see CommerceNet as a potentially cheaper alternative that could be
used to expand their electronic selling activities.
'It will be another mode of electronic commerce, another tool in our tool
kit,' says Sandy Whitson, EDI business manager at HP. The company will move
cautiously, she says, but is keen to explore the potential of public network
electronic sales which could reach a broader range of customers than
existing systems. While CommerceNet is currently focused on
'business-to-business' transactions within a tightly-knit group of about two
dozen companies, its founders have ambitious goals.
'I believe that in two to three years you will see as many as 100,000
companies using the Internet as a principal sales and service channel,' says
Tenenbaum. CommerceNet itself will be handling business transactions for as
many as 3,000 companies by the turn of the century, he predicts.

Publishers tap into global network - The potential of Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Internet, a global 'network of computer networks' linking an estimated
30m computer users, and the forerunner to the much ballyhooed 'information
highway' is creating both opportunities and challenges for traditional
publishers.
Unlike commercial 'on line' information services such as Compuserve, Prodigy
and America On Line, that charge users either according to the amount of
time spent accessing the service or the number of documents read, the
Internet is largely unmonitored.
Any 'information' - be it the text of a novel, the price of stocks or
articles from a newspaper or magazine - that is accessible via the Internet
is essentially in the public domain, free to anyone who can figure out how
to find it in the vast unmapped labyrinth of 'Cyberspace'.
Despite the lack of copyright enforcement on the Internet, which potentially
could undermine the value of their traditional paper-based products, leading
publishing houses are showing increasing interest in the Internet as a new
publishing medium.
The potential of this huge new market - one new Internet user is said to be
'logging on' every two minutes - is too much to ignore, despite the
drawbacks. The new wave of Internet users is dominated by corporate users
and by well-heeled consumers, making them a particularly attractive target
for many publishers.
Several business models have emerged as publishers attempt to tap into this
potentially important new market. These range from offering 'teasers' to
on-line readers in the hopes of persuading them to subscribe to magazines
and newsletters, to experiments with electronic distribution of book
manuscripts.
One of the biggest attractions of the Internet is that it is a very low cost
publishing channel. Anybody with a personal computer, a modem and an account
with one of the hundreds of services that offer Internet access can in
theory 'publish' whatever they wish for the cost of a telephone call.
Beyond lowering the cost of 'vanity publishing', however, the Internet
represents an opportunity to add value to the purchase of reference works
and textbooks. Addison-Wesley, for example, is making one of its textbooks
'Parallel Programming for Scientists and Engineers', available on the
Internet. The publisher assumes that students will still want to buy bound
copies of the book, but will appreciate the opportunity to search the text
on-line.
In another Internet publishing experiment, Encyclopedia Britannica is going
on-line to offer electronic distribution of its materials to universities
and some public libraries. Using software that limits access, the publisher
plans to charge libraries according to a formula reflecting the size of
their subscriber base.
The electronic version of the encyclopedia, called Britannica Online, is
being tested at the University of California at San Diego. The on-line
version includes 'hypertext' links that guide users to related topics as
they search through the text; a feature that cannot be matched by the
traditional book version.
For magazines and newsletters aimed at computer buffs, the Internet can be a
valuable distribution channel. The magazine Wired, which has built a
reputation for publishing articles about the Internet, provides Internet
users with copies of back issues and the opportunity to subscribe on-line
via commercial information services such as America On Line.
The Electronic Newsstand, a Washington, DC-based company founded last year,
offers publishers an opportunity to market magazines, books, newsletters and
business information via the Internet for a Dollars 1000 set-up fee and a
share of subscription payments.
Most of the publishers that use this service provide a few articles from
each issue to lure subscribers. In its first 10 months on the Internet, the
Electronic Newsstand attracted over 3m accesses from over 75,000 different
sites, the company says.
The Electronic Newsstand is in the forefront of a growing trend to create
'billboards on the information highway'; electronic spaces on the Internet
in which companies can display their wares.
Another example of this trend is MecklerWeb, a new venture of Meckler Media,
the US publishing group. Launched earlier this year, MecklerWeb aims to
'provide companies with an inexpensive and rapid means of establishing an
Internet presence,' the company says.
One of the most successful commercial Internet publishing projects is the
Global Network Navigator, an Internet 'magazine' founded last October by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, a US book publisher that specialises in computer
topics.
By last month GNN had attracted over 40,000 registered users and twice as
many unregistered 'visitors' by offering articles about where to find
information resources on the Internet.
GNN is garnering attention from other businesses by establishing
'meta-centres' including a travel centre and a personal finance information
centre that feature a mix of editorial and promotional material.
Yet publishers must tread carefully as they move to exploit the potential of
this self-regulated global village. Founded in the late 1960s as a
government-funded programme to link researchers at US universities and
government laboratories electronically, the Internet was closed to all
business activity until about two years ago and many Internet users remain
resistant to the intrusions of commercial enterprise.
Other drawbacks include persistent security problems as Internet 'crackers'
break through the barriers that companies attempt to build to limit access
to commercially valuable information and the sometimes unreliable
performance of the Internet.
For now, the Internet is being used most effectively to publish information
about products and services that can be delivered through traditional
channels. As metering and billing technologies evolve it could, however,
become a significant medium for publishing and selling all kinds of
'information'.
In the meantime, the Internet can provide companies with a low cost
opportunity to reach markets that are beyond their geographic reach as well
as valuable experience in the emerging market for electronic publishing.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (6): A rush to log on -
In the US, Frank Lipsius looks at the growing appeal of online services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR two years, Andre Knecht, national singles sales manager for Warner Bros
Records, wanted to join the data superhighway with a CompuServe forum about
the music industry.
He won his chance in mid-September when the Music Vendor forum joined what
CompuServe spokeswoman Debra Young says is 400 forums on the online service.
Warner Bros is using its new outlet, accessible to 1.4m CompuServe
subscribers throughout the world, to post new release information that is
normally disseminated only within the music industry through flimsy
new-release books.
Warner pop group Depeche Mode conducted an online press conference on the
Music Vendor forum and Knecht fields questions on changing personnel of rock
groups by staying late at the office to log on. Warner Bros does not expect
to sell anything directly on CompuServe because, although shopping is an
option of CompuServe's 'electronic mall,' information is really the
service's stock in trade.
Information generates the most sales, as when people log themselves onto
airline reservation systems and figure out their own itineraries or buy
shares more cheaply than through brokers. But then CompuServe has extensive
research for stock-market investing, including a screening service to
highlight variables like book value, growth rate, debt/equity ratio and
yield.
A stock quote is constantly at hand by typing GO BASICQUOTES, and the
Analyzer answers financial and ownership questions.
CompuServe's income comes from keeping subscribers logged onto the system.
CompuServe supplies the information while outside vendors make the sales.
For less than Dollars 10 a month, subscribers get unlimited use of free
services but many are surcharged, including even the Music Vendors forum,
though stock quotes are free. As 'the Swiss army knife of all online
services,' (in the words of PC World magazine), CompuServe has the most
comprehensive online service.
But others have found their own niches in a field where information overlap
is almost unavoidable. The Dow-Jones service has exclusive online use of the
Wall Street Journal, its own flagship publication, while Mead Data Central
secured exclusive online use of the New York Times for its Nexis service.
Other popular networks are Prodigy, a co-production of IBM and Sears, which
has a consumer bent; GEnie, General Electric's consumer data service, which
is popular for online conversation and having the latest shareware; and
America Online, a newcomer with less information but speedy communications.
THE Windows interface has made access to the databases merely a few mouse
clicks on provided software. Once logged on, subscribers see icons
highlighting areas of access like news, research, investing, and travel. The
services differ in the way they charge, some putting limits on the time made
available with the monthly fee. All have surcharges for special services.
All these online networks are provided by for-profit companies, but the
network of networks, which carries thousands of networks besides these, is
government-subsidised and non-profit. The Internet, as it is called, came to
prominence when Vice-President Al Gore discussed the data superhighway of
the future, which he expected to be a public-private collaboration.
Many noted that such a thing already existed - Internet - which began as the
means for academic exchange. It gradually grew to include companies
exchanging data with customers, suppliers and their own far-flung outposts.
The debate over who should control the Internet goes on while commercial
activity leaps through the cyberspace. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announced
that it intends to buy Delphi Internet Services which connects customers to
the Internet, while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph said that it soon would
connect customers to the Internet with a toll-free 800 number.
The Internet itself is being inundated with businesses signing themselves
on. As of March 1, this year, more than half of 3,400 networks registered
for the Internet were private businesses, compared to 29 per cent research
institutes and 4 per cent educational centres - 'what is going on now is the
equivalent of a gold rush,' according to Phill Gross, chairman of the
Internet Engineering Task Force. 'Commercial companies, new users, the small
mom-and-pop outfits - they're all rushing into this new frontier.'
The task force is a voluntary group that deals with technical problems on
the Internet, including an effort to provide more security on the system.
The lack of security is itself protection against too much commercial
exploitation of the Internet. But as the National Science Foundation's
measly Dollars 11.5m subsidy is gradually reduced, the system is a tempting
target for commercialisation. For now, businesses that indulge in a
cyberspace version of junk mail are being excoriated by other Internet
users.
The future holds prospects for voice, text and video transmission, a
development that will only increase the appeal of the online services.
Already the Music Vendor forum foresees transmitting artwork, digital audio
files and video on CompuServe.
Knecht says that the Music Vendor forum had more than 1,000 log-ons its
first day, a feat that indicates the potential for this extra-terrestrial
definition of office space. He is leading the way in breaking down the
barriers between consumer and business communication.
But the rapid changes endanger the uniqueness of a channel pioneered by
non-commercial interests. Its fate may be decided all too shortly, as the
leading players in worldwide communications weigh in with their investments.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Technology: A challenging skill to master
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the networking neophyte, entering the Internet feels like arriving in a
foreign city where you don't know a soul and can't speak or read the
language. At first, you suffer from culture shock and finding your way
around is a real challenge.
To master the Internet, you should be prepared to invest considerable time
and effort. 'User friendly' is not a term that has penetrated cyberspace.
Prior experience in using commercial on-line information services such as
Compuserve, Prodigy or America Online will give you a head-start. For many
PC users, these easy-to-use services may prove more rewarding than launching
into the unstructured world of the Internet. They have recently started
offering an electronic mail service over the Internet at a small charge.
If you have a taste for something more adventurous, or a more limited
budget, sign up with one of the Internet public access services  - CIX in
the UK and The Well in California are well-known among Internet aficionados.
Participating in one of the numerous conferences or newsgroups that are
constantly under way on the Internet is a good way to get your feet wet.
While you can learn a lot from these, the most valuable function of the
Internet is the access
that it provides to remote databases. Learning how and where to find useful
information is the biggest challenge for Internet users.
Several information search-and-retrieval tools are available on the
Internet. The best known include Archie, Gopher, WAIS and World Wide Web.
Each offers a standard method of finding information and downloading it from
various computers on the Internet. Details of how to use these programs can
be found in several Internet guidebooks.*
But even if you know where to look for whatever it is you are trying to find
on the Internet, you still face the challenge of figuring out the commands
needed to get to the files you are seeking.
Unfortunately, depending upon the type of computer you are using, and where
your travels take you on the Internet, you may find yourself facing
computers that 'speak' several different dialects.
A knowledge of the Unix operating system is 'useful', the experts suggest.
This is rather like saying that it may be useful to speak French if you are
going to live in France. You can survive without the language, but will be
at a big disadvantage.
Even disconnecting from the system can be a challenge. 'Try one of these
commands: exit, quit, logout, leave, goodbye, ciao, disconnect, CTRL-D or
CTRL-Z,' Tracy LaQuey and Jeanne Ryer advise in The Internet Companion, a
beginner's guide. If none of these works, 'press lots of keys to abort'.
With luck you will hit the right combination.
If this sounds like too much to handle, do not despair. America Online, one
of the easy-to-use commercial information services, is promising to deliver
full Internet access via its point-and-click graphical interface next year.
In the meantime, the good news is that sending and receiving electronic mail
on the Internet is quite straightforward. Put an Internet address on your
business card and everyone will assume you are already a network wizard.

<TEXT>
If your souffle will not rise, someone in cyberspace can help.
The Internet, the global computer network, lets you link up with people of
the same interests, via mailing lists or news groups. You send a message to
sign up and receive the news and opinions of other members of the group.
'Foodwine' is one of the two main lists for gourmets. 'The purpose is for
serious, but not pedantic, discussion of food, beverages and related
concerns,' say Elliott Parker and Musa Knickerbocker who run the list from
Central Michigan University. 'Consider the list as a discussion around a
very large table among people who like to discuss food: the talk may become
passionate and even off-topic sometimes, but always returns to the topic.'
When I dropped in, a discussion of Zinfandel wines was in progress.
Another list is the 'eat-l', where everyone airs their views on how this or
that dish should be cooked. Rachel Karan in Alaska was having problems with
her chicken soup which was too salty. Suggestions poured in: add canned
broth, giblets and so on. Lars Larsen from Sonderberg, Denmark offered 2,000
words on chutney recipes and then 7,000 on cranberry dishes.
In cyberspace you never really know whether the advice is from an expert or
a well-meaning neophyte. So on 'rec. food. restaurants' a posting of 'I'm
off to Greedy Gulch next week. Where can I get some decent food?' will
elicit replies from opinionated locals with whom you cannot remonstrate if
their recommendation turns out to be a greasy spoon.
The list tends to be US-dominated. Asked to recommend somewhere in Soho,
London, Glen Poorman from Michigan suggested Wong Kei, a Chinese restaurant
better known for shovelling customers in and out quickly than for its chow
mein. 'Packed house, incredibly rude waiters and low prices,' enthused Glen,
'but awesome food]'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Fujitsu plans digital challenge in US - The
Japanese computer group is preparing for a head-on multimedia clash with
Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, is planning a multimedia
initiative in the US, which could bring it into head-on competition with
Microsoft, the world's biggest software house.
In April next year, it plans to launch a US version of a futuristic, on-line
role-playing game which it has been testing for more than seven years in
Japan. Called Habitat, it creates a fantasy world on screen - a virtual city
in cyberspace, as multimedia experts would describe it - populated by
characters who take on the personalities of the players. There are some
10,000 regular subscribers in Japan.
Japanese sociologists are already fascinated by the way people behave when
allowed to adopt these electronic alter egos. Within Habitat there is a
'head shop' where players can change their heads, and a 'paint shop' where
they can change their clothes.
However, Habitat - which Fujitsu bought from the Lucas Arts Entertainment
Company, owned by George Lucas, director of 'Star Wars' (see below) - is
more than a game. It can function as an attractive, simple-to-use interface
to a broad range of information and educational services. Students can send
messages to each other on an electronic campus; shops and banks can be
created on screen; and players can send their electronic images off on
shopping trips.
Tatsuzumi Furukawa, Fujitsu main board director and multimedia projects
group manager, says that Habitat will be the first test of Fujitsu's
multimedia capabilities outside Japan. If it proves successful, the service
will be extended to Europe, beginning with the UK in 1996.
A successful Habitat in the US would find itself in direct competition with
Microsoft's planned Microsoft Network, an on-line information service which
the software giant is expected to launch next spring, and which will feature
shopping catalogues, financial services and news services. Microsoft's
prices are expected to be significantly below those of existing on-line
services such as America On-Line or CompuServe. It is expected to offer a
simple user interface, based on Microsoft's best-selling Windows software.
Much will depend on the quality of information available over the respective
networks. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been busily signing up
information providers in anticipation of the start of Microsoft Network.
Fujitsu operates Japan's leading on-line business information service,
Nifty-serve, in partnership with Nissho Iwai. In 1993 it had revenues of
Dollars 130m (Pounds 79m) and profits before tax of about Dollars 13m.
Nifty-serve has a relationship with CompuServe, of the US, but Furukawa
agrees that over the next few years Fujitsu will have to form alliances with
a broad range of information providers. Some will be simple commercial
relationships, but others will be strategic partnerships: 'If an information
provider wanted to start a new kind of service, we would be able to help,'
Furukawa says. 'We have substantial experience now.'
Fujitsu's venture in the US is just one indication of the importance it
attaches to multimedia. It has set a target of expanding sales of
multi-media-related products and services to reach 20 to 25 per cent of
revenues by 1997. Currently the category accounts for only 2 to 3 per cent
of the group's sales.
As a leading electronics manufacturer, it already provides much of the
hardware which is making multimedia possible. It supplies, for example, four
out of the seven regional Bell operating companies with switches and optical
equipment for asynchronous transfer mode transmission, the new technology
which is expected to underpin the information superhighway.
Fujitsu sees multimedia, however, as the leading edge of its translation
from a predominantly hardware manufacturing group - it is best known for its
IBM-compatible mainframe computers - to a services orientated business. The
company is becoming involved in content, developing and marketing
information, entertainment and educational materials. Last June, it
established a Digital Media Group to co-ordinate these activities.
The group has a core of researchers who worked on software for Fujitsu's
pioneering FM-Towns multimedia personal computer (launched some six years
ago) and on three-dimentional animation. The idea is to seek out and work
with Japanese and overseas partners to develop and market software and
programs for CD-Rom, PC on-line communications, cable TV and other media
platforms.
Furukawa says: 'It is something we are taking step by step. In the US there
are many trials of multimedia developments such as video-on-demand. But we
are concerned with how to make a business out of multimedia after the trials
are over.'
The company has a three-pronged approach to the market:
First, there is the on-line information business, represented by Nifty-serve
and Habitat. Fujitsu has a strategic alliance with Sharp, the consumer
electronics company, which has sold some 400,000 personal digital assistants
(hand-held computers capable of accepting handwritten instructions). The two
companies are planning to link Nifty-serve to the PDA, to create a mobile
on-line information service.
Second, cable television. This is a novel service in Japan, and subscriber
numbers are low. But Fujitsu has invested in some 23 cable television
companies. It is a limited experiment; the investment in each amounts to
only 15-20 per cent of the equity, but it is providing a test-bed for trials
of interactive services.
Third, business multimedia. Fujitsu is marketing Team Office developed by
ICL, its UK subsidiary, in Japan. The software makes it possible to share
documents, and for colleagues to work together using linked personal
computers.
Fujitsu and ICL agreed to work together on multimedia developments last
year. The cultural shift was as great for ICL as for its parent. From
marketing large mainframes it had to focus on the home market, education and
entertainment.
McKinsey, the management consultancy, worked with the company for four
months to help ICL understand the dynamics of such a new market. The first
fruits - kiosk systems for the retail and financial services industry - are
now on trial with customers such as Argos, Woolworths and the Nationwide
Building Society.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Yes, it's true. I was a Cybervirgin: Christina Lamb lost her
computer virginity to an addictive system that may well be the electronic
sensation of the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On washing days, when I was young, a favourite game was to burrow inside the
sheets blowing on the line, close my eyes and spirit myself to some faraway
land of exotic foreign playmates.
Nowadays neither imagination nor wind-billowing sheets are necessary.
Instead, late at night when real-world friends are sleeping, I make a coffee
and sit at my desktop computer in Boston, US, to begin travels in the
virtual world which may take me anywhere from an aid organisation in Bombay
to a research station atop a volcano in Hawaii.
Across the globe, millions are engaged in heated on-line discussion of
everything from politics to Elvis sightings, swopping travel or business
tips, or even conducting love affairs with people they have never met. We
are users of Internet, the worldwide web of computer networks and electronic
message (E-mail) systems. Its proliferation looks set to be as important to
the 1990s as the spread of personal computers was to the 1980s and has
enormous social and political implications.
Since access opened to the public two years ago, an estimated 20m people
from 60 countries have subscribed to this peculiar world with its own
language, culture and rules of behaviour or 'netiquette'. According to
figures released in December, at the Internet World '93 conference, 150,000
or more log on each month. In the US no business card is complete without an
E-mail address.
In general users are not computer nerds or social misfits who prefer
communicating with a screen rather than a person. They are ordinary people
seeking electronic soul mates to meet on-line without barriers of racism,
sexism or age, without facing crime on the streets, and with whom they can
form a community to compensate for the fragmentation of family and society.
In The Virtual Community, Howard Rheingold writes of the phenomenon:
'Perhaps cyberspace is one of the informal public places where people can
rebuild aspects of the community lost when the small shop became an
out-of-town mall.'
While taking part in the world's largest ongoing conversation may make
people feel good and enable them to learn about other cultures and garner
information, the implications are far larger. A system that gives direct
access to an educated population equivalent to more than twice that of
Portugal and multiplying, clearly has tremendous political and commercial
potential.
Internet advocates believe its spread will boost grassroots participation in
public policy. Rheingold describes it as an electronic Agora, the
marketplace in Athenian democracy where citizens met to debate. President
Bill Clinton, the first head of state to go on-line, says increasing
electronic access between the public and the administration will revitalise
citizen-based democracy.
All White House press releases and proposals are fed into the system and the
administration aims to provide computers in libraries, town halls and
shopping malls from which people can vent their views. Vice-president Al
Gore has even held an Internet press conference.
Sitting at the keyboard and messaging the US President gives a sense of
empowerment which some find overwhelming. At the Computer Museum in Boston,
where an exhibit allows visitors to send E-mail to Bill, I watched one
voluble character rendered wordless at the keyboard, typing only 'Dear Mr
President, How are You? Geoffrey'. Of course, Clinton is not sitting at his
screen personally replying to the 1,000 E-mail messages he receives each day
but White House officials insist that everyone gets a reply 'after
appropriate consideration'.
Democrats are not the only ones to spot Internet's potential. The Republican
Party executive went on-line last month with an electronic newsletter and
instant rebuttals and counterproposals to Clinton speeches. Marty Connors,
director of the Exchange Foundation, a Republican think tank, has elaborated
a plan called Govern-Net to improve governance by enabling mayors in
different cities to swap ideas and giving people direct access to party
bosses.
He envisages Internet becoming an essential part of election strategy. 'I
see it as perhaps the political tool of the future - at least as important
as mailshots and 'phone campaigning. The idea of reaching households
directly with my message unfiltered is very attractive.' A council officer
in Sunnyvale California was elected after campaigning almost entirely on
Internet.
Others are less convinced of the benefits. Samuel Huntington, director of
the Olin Institute, at Harvard University, warns: 'We are in danger of
creating a two-class society - those who are part of the information
technology revolution and those who are not. Can you train a whole society
to be computer literate?'
For those with access to a computer and modem getting on to Internet is
fairly cheap - less than Dollars 20 (Pounds 13) a month for an hour a day in
Europe and North America. But it is about as user-friendly as the roads in
Birmingham's Spaghetti Junction and first steps in cyberspace can be
daunting. In his book The Whole Internet, Ed Kroll compares it to 'grabbing
a handful of Jello - the firmer your grasp the more oozes down your arm'.
Internet has three main uses. The first is E-mail - electronic messages that
are far cheaper than long-distance telephone calls and faster than the post
(or snail-mail as Net users call it). Second, it functions as a public
bulletin board on which one can read and post messages in 2,500 discussion
groups on everything from out-of-body experiences to the best way to clean
an aquarium. There are groups of subjects under eight main headings such as
'alt' for alternative, 'biz' for business, 'comp' for computer-related
matters and 'rec' for recreational activities. It is like being able to
wander into a series of pubs in which conversations are underway - except
this one never closes. Finally, Internet can be used to retrieve information
from distant locations. That day's Supreme Court rulings, the Encyclopaedia
Britannica and the complete works of Shakespeare are all on-line; satellite
weather maps or entire books can be downloaded in minutes.
The only way to start is to dig in. A cybervirgin, I had been impressed by a
cocktail encounter with a graduate student of economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He told me that he had posted questions from a
tough take-home exam on the Net and soon had economists the world over
working on the solutions, earning him top marks. So when my mother told me
she would like a CD for Christmas of Bach's Concerto for 2 Violins, I hit
the 'm' button late one night to mail a message into 'rec. music.
classical', asking for suggestions of the best recording. When I signed on
the next morning I had 40 suggestions - unfortunately all different.
Inspired by this success, I trailed through and found I could get all the
latest news from Latin America - where I lived until recently - follow
scandals in the beleaguered Conservative government back home in the UK or
read about the hottest jazz clubs in New York. For a while I was a passive
wanderer, enjoying other people's exchanges such as those in 'alt. fan.
british accent' where British users tried to explain to a man from Illinois
how his ancestors from Bedford would have pronounced words such as 'mirror'.
Another favourite is 'alt. good. morning' which tries to brighten the day.
Wednesday's mailings included a poem, a warning from a Finnish user not to
walk on the ice to catch fish, some lyrics from rock band The Cure and a
riddle about the number of people with more than two arms.
Growing more cyberhappy, I began posting, particularly after discovering the
intriguing 'alt. history. what if' group which discusses issues such as what
would have happened if the south had won the Civil War in the US. To
compensate for the absence of body language various conventions have
developed. Laughter is represented by :-) while :-( means the author got out
of bed the wrong side. Writing in capitals is the Net equivalent of
shouting.
Soon I was experiencing my first electronic pick-up line from an 'aspiring
actor in California wishing to discuss Arthurian legends'. It began: 'I am
6ft with curly golden hair and drive a red Corvette.' The Internet is full
of people hoping to discover E-mail love.
David Weinstein, a 32-year-old software designer from Boston, was using the
Net to keep up with developments in his business when he came across 'alt.
personals' - the electronic equivalent of pasting loveletters on a public
notice board.
He says: 'I was lonely and having difficulty meeting Jewish girls so I
placed some ads. It seemed very public so I made them anonymous. That didn't
work so I sent some stories about dating.'
His stories attracted the attention of Michele Schneiderman, a 29-year-old
teacher from Columbus, Ohio and, four months later, they were sharing a
cabin on a Caribbean cruise.
Not all E-mail love stories have happy endings. A notorious Frenchman posed
as a woman on-screen, carrying on a series of Net-romances before being
exposed.
For many their desktop screen has become a shoulder to cry on. Forums have
evolved for Aids and cancer sufferers, for those undergoing divorce and
victims of rape or abuse. One user told me: 'Internet saved my marriage by
being able to talk to others in the same situation'.
Another said: 'Internet is a drug. You can pour your heart out to people
you'll never meet . . . it's like a practice zone for real-life.'
The Net has tremendous practical uses. Teachers in remote areas can compare
lesson plans and academics can swap research findings. Diane Williams, of
the Technology In Education project at Harvard Graduate School, says:
'Through Internet I have been able to discuss ideas with colleagues in
Milan, Tasmania and London and get existing models which I can then adapt.'
She believes Internet will soon offer virtual classrooms for rural or
homebound students. Businessmen find it invaluable for comparing conditions
in China, exploring investment partners, swapping tips on office management
and even marketing products.
Describing Internet as the 'world's largest adhocracy', Oliver Strimpel,
executive director of the Computer Museum, says: 'We are seeing a
fundamental change in the nature and control of information.' Ironically,
for something so anarchic, its origins lie in military thinking. It was
developed as a communications network for the Pentagon able to withstand
nuclear attack. It has no central command and messages are chopped into
small packets of data, routed by the network then reassembled at their
destination.
If any part of the system is wiped out the message simply takes another
route. During the attempted putsch against Gorbachev in 1991 its Russian
counterpart Glasnet kept feeding information to the west and proved
impossible for the coup's perpetrators to block.
While this lack of any central hierarchy - there is no 'Internet Inc' - is
in some sense its glory, it also means there is no one to take
responsibility for abuses or the proliferation of pornography. This month a
Boston man was charged with abducting a young boy he is alleged to have
lured through Internet.
There is another concern. Cables which bring information into the home can
also take it out. Marc Rotenberg, of Washington-based Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility, says: 'While Internet is a great opportunity we
are worried about the potential loss of privacy and the Orwellian spectre
that government could monitor all communication.' His organisation is
fighting US government proposals which would enable federal agencies to
wiretap the information infrastructure without needing court orders.
As the precursor of the interactive world of the much-heralded Information
Superhighway, it is not clear what the final shape of Internet will be. As
federal funding is phased out it will probably be privatised. But, with the
price of hardware tumbling and governments expected to force cable companies
to provide cheap access, the most lucrative profits are likely to accrue to
those feeding in material. A plethora of on-line services are springing up
involving publishers such as Rupert Murdoch, stores such as Sears Roebuck,
which see great potential for advertising their products, and
telecommunication giants and computer companies such as IBM and Apple. Many
newspapers are going on-line too - the San Jose Mercury, USA Today and the
Washington Post.
One warning before you go electronic globetrotting - it is highly addictive.
An advisable first reading is an E M Forster story The Machine Stops, which
paints a chilling picture of a world without human interaction, all
communications taking place through screens . . .
ACCESS TO INTERNET
Access to Internet through on-line services is becoming increasingly
competitive in north America and Europe. Prices vary depending on the amount
of usage and services offered. Some charge per hour on-line - others give
unlimited time. For an individual wanting basic services for about 20 hours
per month, expect to pay about Pounds 15 per month. Software is provided
free but signing on does require a modem which costs about Pounds 100.
Compuserve, one of the largest services, offers a one-month free trial.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Electronic war of words heads from computer to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A virtual war of words in cyberspace is heading for a very real
confrontation in a UK courtroom.
A London physics lecturer is suing a former colleague for libel on the
Internet, a self-regulating global computer network where millions of users
exchange academic ideas, political opinions, and, increasingly, insults.
No date has been set for the case but if the suit goes to trial in the High
Court in London it could expand the definitions of UK libel law and expose
the legal potholes in the information superhighway. Other cases have already
challenged libel laws in the US and Australia.
Usenet, the part of the Internet where the alleged libellous comments
appeared, is sometimes known as the world's largest electronic conference.
It consists of a series of 'news groups' in which an estimated 16m users can
post messages and debate special interests.
Within this conference setting, a culture of 'flaming' - the reckless
exchange of insults - has arisen. Because messages are sent to news groups,
which are accessible to almost all users, rather than individuals, rows
between users are aired in public.
Mr Nick Braithwaite, a media lawyer with London solicitors Clifford Chance,
said that many users forget their private vendettas on the Usenet are out in
the open.
'They think they are having a private conversation but it is like they are
using a megaphone,' he said.
In the UK case, Dr Laurence Godfrey, a former nuclear physicist at the
German Electron Syncroton Laboratory in Hamburg, has issued a writ against
Dr Phillip Hallam-Baker, a researcher at Cern, the European nuclear physics
laboratory in Geneva, claiming damages for libel or slander.
Dr Godfrey is suing for alleged comments about his professional work which
he claims were made by Dr Hallam-Baker on seven separate occasions between
April and July of last year on the Usenet. Dr Hallam-Baker has said the case
will be defended.
Dr Godfrey said he distinguished between insults and libel.
'The everyday insults are not libel and I do not take exception with them,'
he said. 'It is the allegations of an untrue nature that I am suing about.'
In a separate case, however, Dr Godfrey himself is being sued by Carleton
University and Brock University of Ontario, Canada, for Internet comments
which may be in breach of confidence.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (3): Buzzwords in brief - From
Ace and ATM to Lans, Mans and Vans / Although networking has vital
implications for the business world, the technology is often obscured by
technical jargon and buzzwords. Here, for the non-technical reader, Michael
Wiltshire offers some simplified definitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Access control method: the main distinguishing feature between different
local area network (Lan) technologies.
ACE: advanced computing environment - a standard sponsored by a consortium
of 22 vendors, including DEC, Microsoft and Compaq.
ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is the
standard method of identifying characters, numerals and punctuation marks.
ATM technology: asynchronous transfer mode, developed in France in the
mid-1980s, is a breakthrough in communication technology with the potential
to support transmission of combined data, voice and video at up to 45
megabits a second.
ATM opens the door to many new network applications.
Baud: a measure of signal changes per second in a device such as a modem.
Backbone: generic term for a Lan or Wan connections 'trunk' between
sub-networks across an enterprise. Subnetworks are connected to the backbone
via bridges and/or routers.
Bandwidth: the range of signal frequencies that can be carried on a
communications channel.
Bit: a binary unit of information that can have two values, 0 or 1. The word
'bit' is a contraction of binary digit.
Block: a collection of transmitted data.
Broadband: a term with a number of meanings - it was coined originally to
describe a channel with more bandwidth than a standard voice grade channel,
usually a 48kHz link, equal to 12 voice-grade channels. Such channels are
gradually being superseded by digital circuits.
Broadcast: when a user sends a message from one terminal to others on the
network.
CCITT: an international body, made up of telephone companies and other IT
players, responsible for setting global communication standards.
Client-server technology: the most widespread example of network computing:
moves information processing to where it is most economical, fast and
useful; divides computer systems into front-end 'client' workstations and
back-end 'server' processes.
CTI: computer-telephony integration - also known as computer-supported
telephony.
Data compression: a key topic for network managers as multimedia, video,
document imaging and other technologies emerge.
Domains: a Microsoft inspired network structure which separates large
networks into smaller, more manageble segments. A domain can be made up of
multipler servers and thousands of workstations.
DBMS: database management system - a software system to manage data.
DCE: data communications equipment, the hardware that provides connection to
the network; DTE stands for data terminal equipment on a network, eg
computers, printers and plotters.
Digital signature: an encryption method to validate an electronic message.
Distributed database: data located at multiple sites.
Digital signal: this has only two values, normally 0 and 1, during
transmission, as opposed to analogue signals whose values vary all the time.
Dynamic routing: a way of sending messages across a network - if a line
fails or is overloaded, the system will automatically re-route the message.
Packet switching operates on this principle, with the system always poised
to react to ever-changing conditions.
EDI: electronic data interchange for business data such as purchase orders
and invoices between companies.
Electronic mail: sending and receiving messages and text-based information
between computers; the most common application on networks.
Ethernet: one of the oldest Lan technologies, developed by Xerox, Intel and
DEC to run over coaxial cable; highly successful and still popular.
File server: a computer attached to a Lan, usually running on a network
operating system (Nos).
Frames: a segment of data sent over a network medium using a cable or laser.
The frame size is dependent on the protocols and services used.
Frame relay: a data communication method for wide area networks, slowly
replacing X25 - an X series standard, specifying the interface between
computers and packet switched networks.
Groupware: network software that defines applications used by a group of
people. See page five.
GUI: a graphical user interface to enable computer users to easily select a
'menu item' by using a 'mouse' to click on to a graphic icon.
Hub: the centre of a star topology network or cabling system.
Interoperability: the ability of applications on two computer systems to
exchange information so that they can understand each other.
ISDN: the slow-to-emerge integrated services digital network covering a
range of voice, data and image services.
Internet: the most expansive network of computer networks in the world, with
25m users - see article on facing page.

It can lay reasonable claim to being the trendiest magazine in the world.
What New Musical Express and Rolling Stone were to the rise of popular
music, a new US magazine called Wired aims to be for the emerging world of
multimedia. In the 1960s Rolling Stone and NME were essential for young rock
fans who each week bought LPs to play on the mono record players in their
bedrooms. Wired aims to be the essential accessory for a generation brought
up with the personal computer, electronic games and e-mail.
Launched in January last year, with 12 full-time staff and only Dollars
250,000 of capital, Wired's circulation has risen from 150,000 to 230,000
copies a month, mainly in the US.
Its success rests on making the cyberspace world of the computer nerd
accessible to the average consumer. It offers an informed
and exciting guide to the new products, services and businesses which are
being created by the convergence of computers, telecommun-ications and
entertainment.
The magazine's trick is that it approaches this often intimi-dating world
from angles which will satisfy novices and specialists alike. Its apparently
chaotic design borrows heavily from style magazines such as The Face. It has
its very own grammar: each article ends not just with the writer's name, but
also their e-mail address on the Internet networking system. Yet it's not
afraid of being mainstream.
It carries meaty articles which would grace a staid business magazine.
Recent issues have included long pieces about the US government anti-trust
case against Microsoft and the battle between MCI and AT&amp;T in long distance
telecommunications, for instance.
Jane Metcalfe, the magazine's 32-year-old president and co-founder explains:
'We wanted to make a magazine for really modern people living in a digital,
electronic world. All these technologies can allow people to take power
themselves.'
She and her co-founder, Louis Rossetto, spent their savings and almost two
years hawking the project around US publishers before they got their launch
finance. Now they employ 52 people and sell in 26 countries. Wired is also
about to go international in a big way, with a recent deal to start a
Japanese language edition and rapid expansion planned in the UK and
continental Europe.
In the UK, Wired is distributed by CoMag Tel: 0895 444055. By Charles

Armed with a personal computer and a modem, the world of on-line information
is just a telephone line and a mouse click away.
Once on the 'information superhighway' the possibilities are almost
limitless. From weather forecasts to astro physics, there are few subjects
not covered on the internet or in what has become known as 'cyberspace'.
The internet itself is an informal system linking more than 7,500 individual
computer networks and more than 2m computers in academic institutions,
companies and other organisations.
It is used mostly for electronic mail (e-mail) and information exchange by
an estimated 25m to 30m people - a figure rising by between 5 and 10 per
cent a month.
But the internet is not the only source of on-line information. There are
thousands of bulletin board systems (BBS) mostly run by computer
enthusiasts, and a wide range of commercial on-line information services.
So how does the novice begin to explore this world?
The traditional route has been the local BBS - an electronic notice board on
which messages can be left. Most BBS's also enable users to send (upload) or
receive (download) software and other data.
A BBS is run by 'sysops' (systems operators), who are usually computer
enthusiasts to help 'newbies' - newcomers to the world of PC communications.
BBS telephone access numbers - the numbers used by communications software
to connect a home PC modem to the BBS modem - are often listed in computer
magazines.
Most on-line systems, although not CompuServe, expect your communications
software to be set to the following parameters: eight bits, no parity, one
stop (or 8,N,1) and support a number of different 'protocols' or modem
communications languages, for downloading computer files. Among the most
common protocols are Xmodem, Zmodem, Ymodem and Kermit.
Usually there is no charge - other than ordinary telephone charges - for
logging on to an amateur BBS. There are, however, also a growing number of
commercial BBS, most of which advertise in magazines, which charge for
downloading programs (and sometimes pornographic pictures), or can only be
reached via premium-priced telephone numbers.
Although it is reasonably easy to set up communications software and a modem
to dial into a BBS, many new users may find it easier to start with one of
the commercial information services such as CompuServe Information Service
(CIS) or Delphi, or a commercial conferencing system such as the Computer
Information eXchange (CIX).
Although most of these services started in the US they are now available via
a local call in the UK. Their big advantage over the neighbourhood BBS is
that they have helpful telephone 'hotlines' ready to talk new users through
their first tentative steps along the information superhighway.
These services generally charge a join-up fee and then a flat monthly
membership fee of between Pounds 6 and Pounds 10. However, in an effort to
sign up new customers, they often waive the sign-up fee and offer potential
users free trials.
To sign up with CompuServe call 0800-289378 or log on to 0171-490 8881 by
modem with the parameters set to 7,1,E; for CIX call 0181-390 8446 or log on
to 0181-390 1255 with the parameters set to 8,N,1; for Delphi call 0171-757
7080.
New customers usually receive membership kits which, in addition to a local
access telephone number and a password - needed to log on to their master
computer - usually include a manual and, in the case of CompuServe, a
dedicated software package called Cim (CompuServe Information Manager),
which is available in DOS, Windows and Macintosh versions.
Although initial charges are low, it is easy to build up a sizeable bill
quite quickly. Commercial on-line services generally charge a flat monthly
fee, and an additional fee for information outside their basic services,
plus, in the UK at least, the PC user will have to pay telephone call
charges.
To reduce costs, most commercial on-line services give customers local
numbers which can be used to access their services.
There are also special software packages called off-line readers, or OLRs,
that enable you to prepare before the communications software connects to
the service and the meter starts ticking. Using an OLR such as NavCis for
CompuServe or Ameol and WigWam for CIX, a one-hour session can be reduced to
a few minutes on-line.
Commercial on-line services also provide one of the simplest methods of
connecting to, and sampling the internet. For example CIX, CompuServe and
Delphi allow their subscribers to send and receive e-mail to and from other
internet addresses. They also provide access to Usenet newsgroups - there
are around 10,000 Usenet 'discussion groups' on the internet. And CIX and
Delphi provide access to a special IP (Internet Protocol) prompt.
This means users can search for files on remote computers and upload or
download files from other computers connected to the internet using file
transfer protocol (ftp) via the on-line service.
At present however, the commercial on-line services in Britain stop short of
providing 'full' internet access. In particular they do not provide access
to one of the most exciting areas of the internet - the World-Wide Web.
Since its creation in 1992 the World-Wide Web has become the fastest-growing
internet service, with more than 3,000 Web sites and tens of thousands of
documents published by academic institutions, companies and governments.
But to access the Web, the fledgling cybernaut needs a direct internet
connection - available from a specialised telecommunications company, called
an internet service provider. Direct internet access also involves running a
communications program called a TCP/IP stack (the internet's networking
protocol) and setting up for full direct access to the Internet can be
tricky.
Fortunately, however, internet service providers have begun to provide
software - or make it available for downloading. For many new users this may
be a key factor in choosing a service provider.

Interaction of created worlds - Virtual Reality / Optimists see virtual

looks at one of the likely growth markets of the next decade

Many advances in computer software have their origins in play. From the
early chess programs, which were used to demonstrate the power of electronic
brains in the 1950s, to the multimedia shoot-'em-up video games of today,
programmers have used games to push the envelope of software technology.
Advances in high-resolution graphics, data compression, animation and user
interface design have often been pioneered in games software before making
the transition to business. Games and other leisure-based uses of computers
have also laid the ground rules for computer-generated, alternative worlds
or what has come to be called virtual reality (VR). This new strain of
software now promises to open exciting applications in business.
'One way to see VR is as a magical window on to other worlds from molecules
to minds. Another way to see VR is to recognise that in the closing decades
of the twentieth century, reality is disappearing behind a screen,' writes
Howard Rheingold in his book, Virtual Reality.
It could be argued that anyone who sits in front of a computer all day to do
their job, already spends much of their life in VR. Even a simple program
like a spreadsheet can be engrossing enough to its user to suspend physical
reality.
The convergence of computers and communications pushes this even further.
Bulletin board systems and networked chatlines are now well established in
the US and growing fast in Europe. Network services like the Internet, CIX
and Compuserve have created a multitude of widely-dispersed, electronic
communities, each with their own culture. The phenomenon has spawned a new
language, a literary sub-genre (cyberpunk) and the idea of an ultimate
virtual nirvana called cyberspace.
There is, of course, not just one virtual reality, but many. At one extreme,
it is possible to become immersed in VR by using an enclosed helmet with a
built-in display and sensor devices which can pick up body movements.
At the other end of the spectrum, a serious desktop flight simulator such as
Microsoft's package for the PC, can be just as convincing.
VR purists argue that immersion is the only genuine VR experience and there
is research into all-over body suits which can take this to its logical
conclusion. The aim is that such a suit should act both as sensing device to
transfer body movements to the computer and also to convey a sense of touch.
Sensor suits to transmit body movement are already available. At the Virtual
Reality Expo show in London in February, for example, the UK company Virtual
Presence launched a 750 gram, Lycra suit equipped with 96 sensors, and there
are others available in the US.
Work is also under way to build systems which can respond to objects in VR
and transmit this sensation back to the user. Researchers at the University
of North Carolina, for example, have built a device which can be used to
manipulate images of molecules with a full feedback system. The Argonne
remote manipulator (ARM) is used to explore possible combinations of
molecules for new anti-cancer drugs. If the properties of the molecules do
not allow them to fit together, the resistance is conveyed back to the user
as a physical force.
There is also some speculation in fringe literature about the possibility of
direct connections from the human brain to VR systems - thus eliminating the
need for a suit.
At a more mundane and practical level, less intrusive VR software is now
within the reach of the PC user - mainly for games - but increasingly for
other activities such as mail order shopping or travel planning. Desktop
computers are now powerful enough to handle high-quality, three-dimensional
graphics and convey an impression of space. It is now possible to walk
around buildings which do not exist, fly a jumbo jet through a thunderstorm
and visit places on the other side of the world without leaving your desk.
The concept of VR has, of course, been around for some time. The
well-established flight simulator, for example, has been used for training
pilots since the early days of flying. More recently, simulated environments
have been devised for other training activities - such as working in
hazardous environments.
What marks out the new generation of VR software is that it goes beyond
merely representing the physical world - like a flight simulator - or
creating a possible future with a spreadsheet. VR enables the creation of
worlds which do not exist and allows interaction with them.
This has spawned a generation of software tools which can help to visualise
data in new ways.
Superscape, a VR tool from the UK company Dimension, has been used, for
example, to show the effects of drugs on the human body. The software allows
a user to navigate around a representation of the body and see the effect of
a drug down at the molecular level.
'The market is only now becoming aware that VR products are available for
low-cost computing. Once their eyes are opened to it, the ideas come rushing
in. We have about 30 applications built with Superscape and most of them
have come from customers,' says Mr Ian Andrew, managing director of
Dimension.
In addition to the drug simulation VR, which is being used by SmithKline
Beecham, Superscape has been used to build VR environments as diverse as a
telecommunications network simulation for British Telecom and an exhibition
modelling system for Dragon Exhibitions.
Although Superscape can support the more exotic VR peripherals, such as
headsets and sensors, Mr Andrew says that the demand is for applications
which are non-immersive and based on the desktop: 'Immersive VR was what
caught people's imagination in the first place - but most people are
uncomfortable with it. I'd say 90 per cent of what we do is for the desktop.
But we have left room to support the other devices and can offer users an
upgrade path when they need it,' he explains.
Faberushi, another UK VR specialist has built a multimedia virtual
exhibition system (VES) which re-creates the sound, look and feel of an
exhibition floor. Virtual visitors to the show can walk up to a virtual
computer screen and see a demonstration of a product.
'The interaction between people and machines is what is important about VR.
It lets you create spatial relationships which is very appealing - people
understand the rules of space,' says Mr Perry Huber, a consultant with
Faberushi.
'Proper VR allows you to move around in free form - like surrogate travel.'
Mr Huber also sees VR changing the way we use computers and improving the
user interface: 'One of the obvious things in the business environment is
that you can get way from simple graphical user interfaces. The three
dimensionality lets you bring a context to data and visualise it better.'
Data visualisation in three dimensions might seem far fetched. But imagine
explaining what a spreadsheet program could be used for ten years' ago.
VR offers the same potential to change the way data is viewed and presented.
Software developers are already experimenting with the possibilities. Maxis,
a US software company, has built a VR package which simulates the Wall
Street Stock Exchange in the form of a casino. Prospective investors can
risk their funds and enjoy themselves at the same time.
The market for VR products like these is expected to grow quickly over the
next few years and an increasing percentage of revenues will come from
commercial applications. Market researcher Frost &amp; Sullivan (F&amp;S) forecasts
a growth rate of 65 per cent a year in the US market, with revenues
exceeding a billion dollars by 1997.
Leisure-based applications are expected to dominate throughout this period
and show the largest growth. Another US market researcher - 4th Wave -
estimates that 70 per cent of 1993 revenues for VR products came from the
entertainment sector and this will increase to 76 per cent by 1997.
But commercial applications of VR technology on the desktop are likely to be
the most profitable - with training, data visualisation and computer-aided
design leading the way. Specialised commercial applications which can
harness the power of VR software will sell at a premium.
The parallel growth of high bandwidth telecommunications and multimedia
technology - both of which provide the infrastructure for VR applications -
promises to make the market for VR software one of the most exciting growth
areas into the millennium.
VR could also precipitate change in wider context.
The pessimistic view is that it will lead to the disturbing future described
by Aldous Huxley where people hide from the grimness of the physical world
at the 'feelies'. The optimistic view is that VR will enable humans to find
a richer form of communication, unimpeded by the laws of the real world.
One thing is clear, an increasing amount of communication between humans
will be mediated by computer software and, even when this is not called VR,
that is exactly what it will be.

FT  20 NOV 92 / Survey of Home Entertainment (5): Explosion of activity -
Virtual Reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japan and on both sides of the Atlantic the 'hot' new subject for
high-tech computer whizz-kids is Virtual Reality - or VR to those in the
know.
The past 18 months has witnessed an explosion of activity surrounding VR,
including heavyweight books on the subject, conferences, seminars and
exhibitions and an unexpected cinema box office hit - The Lawnmower Man.
Meanwhile, among all the hyperbole, the first practical applications of VR -
in the entertainment sector and in other fields - have begun to appear. At
the same time VR, and the mostly small start-up companies which have
pioneered the technology, are beginning to be taken seriously by big
multinational companies, academic institutions and government agencies.
Exactly what constitutes VR is still a matter of fierce debate. VR's roots
are in aeronautics and space research and it is a descendant of flight
simulators.
Today, VR is generally taken to mean a mixture of computer hardware and
software built around complex databases which enable the user to interact
with objects in an imaginary 3-D 'cyberspace' world.
This can either be achieved using using a 'dataglove' fitted with sensors
that pick up the real hand's movements and a helmet containing small LCD
screens in front of each eye - so-called 'immersion VR' - or using an
ordinary personal computer, a high resolution screen and a device, sometimes
called a 'spaceball,' to control movement - 'desktop VR.'
Some VR purists insist that 'immersion' VR is the only real VR, particularly
for entertainment applications.
However it has some serious drawbacks because using the equipment for more
than half an hour can result in a form of nausea called 'simulator
sickness', and the tiny screens inside VR helmets cannot provide the
high-quality images needed for virtual worlds to be convincing.
For 'serious' applications, such as architectural or engineering modelling,
design testing or process simulation, desktop VR is becoming increasingly
popular - helped on its way by tumbling hardware costs and increasingly
powerful microprocessors.
Nevertheless, some of the most immediate applications are likely to be in
the entertainment sector.
Virtual reality arcade games have begun to arrive and toy industry analysts
expect virtual reality versions of home video games to appear in the near
future.
Nintendo has already produced a Dollars 99 Powerglove, a simple version of a
dataglove, which lets video-game addicts play with hand gestures.
Outside the home in the US and elsewhere, leisure groups have plans for VR
entertainment centres and theme parks and Japanese electronics groups such
as Sony and Matsushita, which also own film studios and theatres, are said
to be watching developments closely.
For the moment, VR systems are a lot less sophisticated that most science
fiction writers would have the reader believe.
But this, too, will change.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (10): A long wait for
'vaporware' - The prospects for the main operating systems strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDOWS NT 'represents nothing less than a fundamental change in the way all
companies can address their computing requirements,' Mr Bill Gates, head of
Microsoft, proclaimed at the end of May.
Modesty may be inap- propriate at the official launch of a company's
flagship soft- ware product, but it is fair to accuse Mr Gates of premature
optimism. Development of Windows NT, an operating system for a wide range of
computers, is well-advanced. But it will be at least two months before the
basic software is generally available and it will be even longer before
other important components are released.
It is, of course, a common ploy to announce products before they are ready.
It is the classic way to protect an installed base. Microsoft, like its
rivals, has used the ploy before - with the original Windows software, for
example - and will doubtless use it again.
Mr Stuart Allsop, a US newsletter publisher, coined the term 'vaporware' to
describe the practice. He regularly publishes a Top Ten chart of the
products which have been 'in vapor' the longest.
Windows NT has been on the list since the start of the year, after Microsoft
failed to meet its scheduled delivery date in December 1992. Windows NT was
first announced in April 1991 - putting it 'in vapor' for over two years.
Although NT officially stands for New Technology, it suggests other
interpretations - Not Today, Not Tomorrow, etc.
But it would be wrong to single out Microsoft for castigation. Novell, its
fiercest critic and closest rival in the operating systems market, had
similar delivery problems with the latest version of its NetWare networking
software. NetWare 4.0 was 'in vapor' for 13 months before being finally
released in March this year.
All is fair in the current 'soft wars' and premature announcements are low
down the list of marketing weapons currently being deployed by all the
participants.
In March, for example, a group of Microsoft's main rivals banded together to
announce a possible, final solution to the problem of the many different
versions of Unix in anticipation of the final arrival of Windows NT. IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun, Unix Systems Laboratories and Santa Cruz Operation -
all formerly in different factions of the Unix camp - said that they would
conform to a Common Open Software Environment specification.
Microsoft was conspicuously absent from the party - a factor which leaves
Cose lacking in credibility. Microsoft is, after all, the world's biggest
supplier of open software environments.
Although Mr Gates may have overstated its significance, Windows NT will
certainly mean change for the biggest single constituency in the computer
industry: tens of millions of users of MS/DOS-based personal computers.
It is more than a replacement for MS/DOS and Windows 3.1. Windows NT gives
Microsoft a product specifically to compete in the mid-range and enterprise
systems market against Unix and IBM's OS/2. It is designed to use the
so-called client-server architecture, a technique for distributing functions
across a network of many different computers.
Microsoft aims to extend the client-server principle from the most humble
desktop 'client' computer up to the new high-performance reduced instruction
set computers (Risc). It is working with Digital Equipment to build systems
based on DEC's Alpha Risc, for example.
The combination of Alpha's advanced architecture and Windows NT could
challenge even the largest mainframe systems on both performance and
function. If Windows NT succeeds, Microsoft may come to dominate the entire
software market.
But the question remains whether Microsoft can convince the market that it
has got certain important components in the NT 'family' right. The
networking component, in particular, will come under close scrutiny.
Microsoft has made several attempts to break into the market for PC
networking software, but to no avail.
While it seems unlikely that Microsoft will lose its grip on desktop
computers, it faces a real challenge in the networking market from Novell -
which currently dominates with NetWare.
But Novell, too, has had its failures. Its attempts to break into the
desktop operating system market - by taking over Microsoft's former rival
Digital Research - have had little impact.
The most likely resolution to the conflict is that the two companies will
continue to dominate their respective markets and be forced to combine their
efforts.
Mr Dan Kikinis, president of California-based Oakleigh Systems and the
designer of Elonex's range of PCs, says: 'Microsoft has not been very
successful in the Lan market and Novell is not really successful in the
operating systems market. The two will have to work together whether they
like it or not.
'Windows NT needs another year before it will make any real impact. It will
be difficult for Microsoft to get users to change how they work - and Novell
is still well ahead in networks,' he adds.
So it will be some time before the jury of the marketplace reaches its
verdict on Mr Gates's latest brainchild.

Virtual Reality could be the next clacker ball craze (though considerably
more expensive), the next electric car, or the successor to television.
There is a tremendous amount of talk about this 'three dimensional
experience' developed by chaps in the computer and computer games
businesses, but very little on offer to the public. Horizon (8.10 BBC2)
investigates, promising that 'Sir Michael Hordern is tour guide to the
electronic frontier of cyberspace'. Hmm.
Channel 4 aims to show what private investigators are really like in
Watching The Detectives (9.00), a five-part series using verite techniques
to record the activities of three American gumshoes and two British. Today's
subject is a former jockey who repossesses cars, follows a woman whose
husband is suspicious, and tracks down cut-price kitchen units.
With its eye on the local elections on May 2, Panorama (9.40 BBC1) has a
studio debate about the future of local government. To mark the 70th
birthday of Satyajit Ray, Channel 4 has mounted a season of his films,
prefaced tonight (11.00) by a documentary in which Shyam Benegal interviews
Ray and shows extracts from many of his works.

FT  20 DEC 94 / On-line cafe society: Ronald van de Krol wanders through
Amsterdam's Digital City - The power of communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far removed from the canals, bicycles and red light districts of Amsterdam,
thousands of Digital City residents are glued to their computer screens,
experiencing a life of lonesome sociability.
In a world of computer-based communication, they are meeting other computer
owners in electronic 'cafes', sending messages to mailboxes in the system's
'post office', or hovering in the 'main square', on the off-chance they
might meet someone interesting.
Amsterdam's Digital City was launched in January as a three-month project to
stimulate electronic communication and provide equal and widespread access
to information. But its sponsors, including the city and national
government, have been surprised by its popularity. The three-month timescale
has long since been abandoned, and the programme is about to take into
service a much bigger computer to handle a flood of 'immigrants'.
The city offers databanks, message groups and bulletin boards, similar to
those available on the global Internet system, but more compact and far less
daunting, and in Dutch, rather than English.
Residents can hook electronically into services, such as Urban Desires, a
computer basket described as an interactive magazine of metropolitan
passions. They can wander imaginary corridors, meeting fellow
metro-travellers, on their way to more than 100 metro stops created by local
computer buffs. Or they can drop in on one of the 'buildings' rented in the
para-city by organisations such as the Amsterdam tourist office, the Anne
Frank Foundation and the University of Amsterdam, to collect information or
ask questions.
Most residents enter the city from their offices or homes, using their own
computers, modems and telephones. But there are also tariff-free computer
terminals available at Amsterdam city hall, the public library and De Balie,
an avante-garde cafe that is the spiritual birthplace of the city.
Once in, users are greeted with messages declaring: 'You are the 1,757th
user today and the 45,341th this month.' This is an incentive for some, but
a deterrent for others. 'This city is becoming much too crowded,' complains
one computer resident after failing repeatedly to log on for lack of
available telephone and computer space.
To a first-time visitor, the city can be a bewildering fusion of high-tech
communication, old-fashioned chat and channel-surfing through television
channels by remote control. It is a bit like ham radio, except that the
voices have been replaced by words flashing by on the computer screen and
the crackle of radio frequency static has made way for the silent hum of the
computer-modem connection.
The city is populated by characters calling themselves 'Daydreamer', 'Nini'
and 'Tulip'. Much on-line 'talk' in the cafes is quick-paced but banal. For
example, one participant announces that he's just bought some croissants,
another types in 'yummy'.
By contrast, those taking part in electronic discussions about politics or
society are more high-minded. One heated exchange touched upon the
democratic credentials of those running the project and centres on the right
of the poor and those without computer equipment to take an active part in
'Amsterdam'.
Digital Amsterdam was launched to make computer communication a low-cost
reality for all citizens of the real Amsterdam, by providing access to the
network for the price of a local telephone call. However, the need for extra
cash has raised the possibility that commercial businesses will be
encouraged to rent 'buildings' in the city where they can ply their trade.
One objector to this proposal ends a digital outpouring with warnings of
totalitarianism and a parting shot from Voltaire: 'It's dangerous to be
right when the government is wrong.'
The Digital Citizens' Rights Movement of the Netherlands, contributes to the
on-line discussion about commercial sponsorship with a warning that
'governments and businesses must not be allowed to run the show'.
For others, even the price of a local phone call threatens to undermine the
birth of a true digital democracy. 'In Santa Monica, California, even the
homeless can take part in discussions on the local Freenet,' one Amsterdam
resident says.
A few hours in the city are enough to leave the reassuring ' if sometimes
depressing ' impression that people in the dawning world of virtual cities
and computer communication are ultimately very much like the people who once
sent messages by homing pigeons.
There is humour, intolerance, rudeness and honesty, in roughly equal
measure. There is also no lack of controversy.
Although firm figures are hard to come by, the regular residents estimate
that as many as 90 per cent of the city's inhabitants are men. They tend to
be aged between 15 and 30 and like to stay up late. As in the real
Amsterdam, the Digital City comes to life after 10pm.
Digital Amsterdam is also quite anonymous. You may be talking to a man who's
using a woman's name, or vice versa, and no one can tell. 'Often, an Astrid
is in reality a Willem,' says Hanneke Vermeulen, a systems operator of the
computer-based network.
This anonymity means that the Digital City-dweller need never be shy to
strike up a conversation with a stranger. At least in the beginning, people
in cyberspace can hide behind their fictitious names if they want, only
letting down their guard when they have developed a rapport with a new name
on the system.
Of course, there is no reason why two residents of Digital Amsterdam could
not arrange to meet at a real cafe in the real Amsterdam. But surprisingly,
perhaps, long-time residents say this does not happen often. 'It's easier
when you don't have to meet up face to face,' one regular at the computer
'pub' confesses. 'The person you've come to know through the screen can be
disappointing when he's sitting across from you.

Inspired by the Weekend FT's article on 'cyberspace', the free-floating
electronic community created by computer users all round the world, one
colleague has made a nasty discovery.
Electronic communication is even more cliche-ridden than the old-fashioned
kind.
Cyber-correspondents rejoice in turning their most frequently used cliches
into acronyms. Messages are spattered with jargon like GMTA ('Great minds
think alike'), IMHO ('in my humble opinion'), which must have them ROTFL
('rolling on the floor laughing'). There is even an electronic counterpart
to the letter writer's SWALK ('sealed with a loving kiss') - NIFOC ('naked
in front of computer').

FT  30 APR 94 / Switched on for cyberchat: Christina Lamb has a host of new
contacts since her Internet article
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month ago I wrote about my adventures in cyberspace through Internet, the
worldwide web of computer networks. Just to see what would happen we printed
my e-mail message address quite discreetly at the end for readers to send
comments.
The next morning I switched on my computer to find more than 100 messages -
comments on the article from places as diverse as Poland, Zambia and Los
Angeles.
The following morning I signed on with anticipation to find another 80
messages, many with suggestions for further articles or even series on the
same theme. Some people I had already replied to had written back again.
By the end of the week I had heard from more than 300 readers and one month
on I am still receiving e-mail messages about the piece. This is far more
than our letters editor receives for even the most controversial articles
and many of these are never seen by the reporters.
And while people are usually spurred by irritation to writeletters to a
newspaper, my e-mailers were friendly, positive and did not include a single
Mr Angry. The ease and informality of being able to sit down at the keyboard
and knock off a message directly to the writer seems to stimulate good
humour.
Many, I think, were inspired to correspond by the article's headline, 'Yes
it's true. I was a cybervirgin', dreamt up by an imaginative sub-editor.
Messages often began 'Dear cybervirgin'. Some even wanted to share their own
cyber-deflowering. Robert Dilworth, in Frankfurt, wrote: 'My first time was
six weeks ago and I'm 35 years old . . .' I kept expecting a threatening
message from the Internet postmaster, accusing me of providing a sex
service.
I began to look forward every morning to a new surge of mail and even
cancelling real-life dates in order to have time for new cybercontacts.
Unsurprisingly, given the net's roots in academia, a large number of
messages came from professors and researchers, ranging from the geography
department of Edinburgh University to the English department of Rhodes
College, Memphis; from Nairobi to the University of California (UCLA).
The second biggest group were businessmen, from owners of small companies
extolling the virtues of Internet in enabling them to develop a home-based
business into one with customers and suppliers all over world, to the
president of Citibank in Moscow who kept me updated on the city's snowfall.
The third most prolific message-senders work for organisations such as the
World Bank, a UK teachers' union, the UN and the European Union.
I heard from FT correspondents in remote places such as Kiev and with whom I
am now carrying on a lively correspondence; I received messages from an old
schoolfriend with whom I had lost touch; and from contacts in Brazil, my
last posting, telling me the latest gossip and inflation figure. A man in
Bombay even said the article had saved his skin by providing fodder for a
talk he was due to give.
Apart from being entertaining, many were useful. A professor in South Africa
is giving me a daily personal account of the elections, while a reporter on
the local Boston paper is providing a useful exchange of ideas. While the
length of some messages led me to speculate over the amount of time some
people had on their hands, one paediatrician impressed me by writing his
e-mail mid-air, ready to send as soon as the flight landed.
Most of the messages came from enthusiasts frustrated by the media's
tendency to focus on negative aspects of Internet.
Many described signing on initially just for messaging, only to find a new
world awaiting them. James Quirke, from Wolverhampton, who subscribed to
correspond with his daughter at Bradford university, says: 'Yes it is
addictive but I've never had so many friends.'
Some wanted to complain about cyberjunk; others had been inspired by the
article to try to access the mass of information available online. For some,
messaging me was their first attempt at e-mail overseas or outside their
company. There emerged a generalised frustration over the cost of access in
Europe, although I received many suggestions for the cheapest methods.
The experience showed that such interactivity will be the norm in the
future. In the US, more than 100 newspapers are online and subscribers can
message reporters directly for more information or to comment on articles.
Some newspapers, such as the Raleigh Observer in North Carolina, have their
computer systems connected to local schools enabling students to send in
sports reports or make comments.
And from the journalist's perspective, for the first time in seven years I
feel a real sense of who readers are and what they are interested in.
The only problem is that I am so busy reading and replying to e-mail that
there is no time left to write articles . . .

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (22):
Potentially large market in the longer term - Like so much pioneering
technology, the first generation of these small devices has largely failed
to meet user-expectations - but a wave of improved products is on the
horizon / Tom Foremski highlights advances in personal digital assistants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and personal communicators represent the
next big computer market, and for some industry observers, possibly the last
of the potentially large market categories for computers.
These small computer devices represent the logical progression of computer
technologies as they move from the desktop, to portable computers, to the
lap-top and finally to the so called palm-top. But like much pioneering
technology, the first generation of these devices have so far failed to meet
user expectations.
However, there are encouraging signs that the second generation of products
will overcome some of the problems.
Apple Computer was the first to coin the term 'PDA' which is rapidly turning
into a generic name for small computers with communications capabilities.
Tandy, which sells the Zoomer, sometimes uses the term 'personal information
assistant,' while IBM and AT&amp;T prefer the term 'personal communicator.'
They all describe a small computer that can be comfortably held in the hand
or slipped into a jacket pocket, with a touch-sensitive screen with a pen or
stylus input device and wireless communications capabilities for sending and
receiving electronic mail or faxes and transferring files to a desktop
computer.
A typical PDA will include software that consists of a word processor, a
diary for scheduling appointments, and a database to store information such
as phone numbers and addresses.
The first PDAs to hit the market were the Apple Newton MessagePad, Tandy's
Zoomer and AT&amp;T's Eo Communicator. Each has taken a slightly different
approach but all are united by the fact that their sales have been far short
of stellar.
The Newton MessagePad represents the most ambitious technology. It includes
sophisticated handwriting recognition software that turns the 'digital ink'
that is written by the user with a special stylus, into computer text. While
the handwriting recognition technology is state-of-the-art and works better
than most previous handwriting recognition technologies, its performance has
not impressed most users.
The handwriting recognition of the Newton fails to recognise many words,
resulting in a sometimes comical re-interpretation of the users words, as
satirised recently in the Doonesbury comic strip.
The Newton also has problems with foreign languages, especially German where
average word lengths are 10 characters instead of the six characters average
for English words. Newton has also been faulted for its communications links
which do not perform as well as expected.
The Tandy Zoomer, also marketed as the Z-7000 by Casio, has avoided, to a
large degree, the quagmire of handwriting recognition. It cannot recognise
cursive writing but it does have a very limited ability to recognise printed
characters. It prefers to store images of the user's notes instead of
performing the difficult handwriting interpretation.
The AT&amp;T Eo Personal Communicator packs more technology into its sleek box
than Newton or Zoomer, but it is twice the price. Unlike the others, it
includes a 20-megabyte hard drive that allows it to store much more
information. But it suffers from a short battery life - about two hours -
and you really need to upgrade the machine's memory to use its fax and
e-mail communications features.
All the leading PDAs have been criticised for being too slow and they all
use different operating systems which makes it difficult to produce a decent
number of software applications.
The Newton has its own proprietary operating systems, the Zoomer uses the
Geos software from GeoWorks, and the Eo device uses the PenPoint operating
system.
This multiplicity of operating systems makes life difficult for software
developers. They have to try to guess which device will sell enough units to
create a large enough potential market to justify the expense of
applications development. And without sufficient quantities of third-party
software, the PDAs face a limited appeal.
Despite the initial problems that have beset the first-generation PDAs, the
second generation devices promise improvements and new features that will
make them more useable and hopefully will fulfil the large unit sales
expectations of market researchers.
Apple, for example, is redesigning the Newton to add better communications
capabilities, and an improved operating system. Handwriting recognition is
also improved but, in what is an admission of a less-than-perfect system,
the next Newton will have the option to store images of a user's notes
without converting the handwriting to computer text.
AT&amp;T, stung by the disappointing sales of the Eo Communicator, is
redesigning the system, lowering the price and making it more of a mobile
telephone with computer features.
Other leading computer companies are also planning PDA introductions. Compaq
Computer, Motorola, IBM, and Sony are just a few of the big companies that
will introduce PDA-type devices later this year.
IBM's plans include a variety of PDAs designed for specific tasks, such as
one model equipped with voice recognition for dictating documents and using
a pen-input device for editing. Another IBM PDA is designed for e-mail
communications, allowing users to hear messages spoken in a
computer-generated voice and to dictate a response.
PDAs could benefit greatly from a standard user interface. General Magic, a
Silicon Valley-based company, earlier this year unveiled its Magic Cap user
interface which is specifically designed for PDA devices with communications
capabilities. The Magic Cap interface features a tiny graphical user
interface using a buildings metaphor. Users navigate through the systems to
reach different applications by choosing different types of buildings such
as a post office, for example, to send messages.
Magic Cap is designed to work with on-line services such as Compuserve or
AmericaOnline and specialised on-line services that use the companion
Telescript technology. Because of the small storage capabilities of PDAs,
on-line services are becoming a key factor in the success of PDAs. They will
offer data storage services to PDA customers and also carry e-mail and
faxes.
AT&amp;T recently announced its PersonaLink on-line service that will support
PDAs, and Apple's eWorld on-line service will support Newton users.
It is said that you can always recognise the pioneers by the arrows in their
backs and although the first generation of PDAs collected a fair number of
arrows, it is only a matter of time before the next generations become
ubiquitous and useful devices.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: New billboard on the highway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mecklermedia, a US technology publishing group, last week launched
'MecklerWeb', an electronic communications and marketing system aimed at
businesses that want to have a 'corporate presence' on the Internet.
For Dollars 25,000 per year, MecklerWeb will provide companies with a
billboard on the electronic highway; a place to present their product
information, corporate messages and news.
This is unlikely to cause offence in the anti-advertising culture of the
Internet, however, because the group will not distribute promotional
materials. Instead it will provide a commercial catalogue that users may
choose to browse at will.
'Cyberspace is not a mass market,' says Christopher Locke, president of
MecklerWeb. 'You don't have to target audiences, they self select. The real
opportunity here is not traditional advertising, but rather a new method of
building business relationships and achieving market presence.' MecklerWeb
will be organised into broad topical areas of interest such as law,
medicine, sports and technology. Within each, sub-groups and specialties
will be arranged in an hierarchical structure. As well as the corporate
information, MecklerWeb intends to create discussion groups that could lure

<LEADPARA>  Biologists have learned to harness viruses to create vaccines and, in recent
years, to reprogram faulty chromosomes by using viruses to smuggle new genes
into cells.;   Now a small but growing group of computer scientists is
examining the possibility of designing computer viruses and similar programs
called worms to burrow into computer networks and set in motion a whole range
of beneficial activities.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Many computer users have been the victims of malicious virus programs
propagating through networks and erasing data or causing the whole system to
fail. But now some researchers are suggesting it is possible to harness the
subtle power of computer viruses to perform useful tasks.;   They imagine
self-propelled programs gliding through a network of hundreds of thousands of
computers, automatically updating software, diagnosing hardware problems,
seeking out information stored in vast data banks or doing routine garbage
collection -- mopping up the residue of leftover calculations that can clog up
memory banks.;   "Although malicious viruses certainly must be brought under
control, it is also imperative that the fear of viruses not keep computer
scientists from exploring the many benefits they could bestow," Fred Cohen,
the scientist who coined the term "computer viruses," wrote in the current
issue of The Sciences, published by the New York Academy of Sciences.;   Some
computer security experts scoff at the idea. Eugene Spafford of Purdue
University says he is not opposed in principle to computer virus research. But
the experts argue that in a world increasingly dense with computer networks,
software designers must rethink the potential hazards of releasing autonomous
programs into the electronic milieu.;   "It's just as if we're doing
biological research," Spafford said. "We wouldn't encourage somebody to work
on recombinant DNA in their garage.";   The power of computer viruses for
constructive and destructive uses is growing. In May, for example, the U.S.
Army Signals Warfare Division issued a $550,000 contract for research into the
study of viruses as military weapons.;   Cohen was one of the first academic
researchers to openly study computer viruses. As a graduate student at the
University of California, Los Angeles, he conducted experiments showing that
viruses could be as useful as they are dangerous.;   But when he set loose a
virus to demonstrate to campus administrators that their systems were
vulnerable, their response was to shut their machines to further experiments.;
  In his article, Cohen described a virus-based bill-collecting program he has
invented. In a traditional bill collector, a single program, often cumbersome
and complex, monitors all accounts and sends out overdue notices.;   In
Cohen's system, a simple virus program is spawned each time a customer makes a
transaction. Every month, the virus checks to see what its customer owes and
dispatches a bill. Once the account is settled, the collector deletes itself.;
  Useful as such devices might be, other experts are uneasy about the idea of
distributed systems, in which friendly viruses wander through a network,
performing maintenance chores or borrowing computer time here and there to
solve especially difficult problems.;   Spafford says there is always an
ethical question raised when a program is written to run on somebody else's
computer.;   "There is no easy answer to this problem," said Peter Neumann, a
computer security expert at SRI International research center in Menlo Park.
"Distributed computing has enormous potential, but you can use it
destructively. It's a two-edged sword.";   Computer viruses actually started
out as helpers rather than invaders. The precursor of modern software viruses
and worms is probably a simple game called Darwin, invented in 1962 by two
Bell Laboratories computer scientists, Doug McIlroy and Victor Vyssotsky.;  
The two researchers designed a game in which programs competed within the
computer's memory. The winner was the one that could kill all its opponents by
erasing them.;   In 1981 at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, John Shoch and
Jon Hepp wrote a series of computer programs that would scurry around the
laboratory's network performing helpful tasks. They named their programs worms
after similar programs that had been described in a science-fiction novel.;  
One of their most powerful programs was called a vampire worm. It was designed
to hide until the human users had left for the night and then come to life and
parcel out a large calculation to computers all over the network.;   In the
morning, as the computers were reclaimed, the vampire program would shrink
away and wait until the machines were freed again the next evening.;  
Carrying the biological metaphor even further, scientists today are
experimenting with systems to create software too complex to be designed by
humans, using a type of Darwinian evolution instead. They start with a seed
program that changes slightly each time it runs. Most of these random
mutations don't help, but every once in a while the system hits upon a slight
improvement. After millions of these tiny adaptations, a complex program is
born.  </TEXT>

FT  21 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Elvis found in cyberspace - Digital jukeboxes
are set to have a big impact on the music industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was almost exactly a year ago that Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson, a couple
of Californian computer science students, launched their digital jukebox,
IUMA, alias the Internet Underground Music Archive.
IUMA has since used the Internet to send samples of alternative rock music
everywhere, from Arizona to Australia. It charges each band of musicians
Dollars 20 to Dollars 75. Listeners tune in for free. All they need is
access to the Internet to download the music on to their computer sound
cards before transfering it to an ordinary cassette.
Lord and Patterson are cyber-buffs who used their skills and a Dollars
20,000 computer system to reach out to fellow music fans. Their concept has
since been copied by hundreds of other digital jukeboxes all over the world,
and is attracting the attention of the multinationals that dominate the
Dollars 30.4bn music industry. The major record companies now recognise that
digital diffusion is a serious phenomenon that will, eventually, account for
a significant chunk of music distribution. What they do not know is how
quickly it will take off - or how to approach it.
'We're working in the dark,' says Sara John, director of legal affairs for
the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in London. 'There's no doubt that at
some stage digital diffusion will become a major part of the music market.
My personal opinion is that it could happen very, very quickly.'
At present the industry is in the unenviable position of not knowing whether
digital diffusion is a golden opportunity to boost profits, or a threat to
its financial stability. The global music market is dominated by six
companies - Sony, Time Warner, Matsushita, Bertelsmann, Thorn-EMI and
Polygram.
If a compact disc sells for Pounds 12.99 in the UK, the artist earns 88p,
the producer 44p, the publisher 44p and the manufacturer Pounds 1.05. The
retailer takes Pounds 3.25 and the record company Pounds 4.66 (mostly to
cover distribution costs), leaving Pounds 2.27 for VAT.
This means that if a record company can deliver a compact disc directly to
the consumer's home, it will save the chunk of the Pounds 4.66 previously
spent on distributing it to the record shop and the retailer's Pounds 3.25.
In short, it will be able to sell the same product for the same price much
more profitably.
Such calculations have encouraged the major groups to dabble in digital
diffusion. Warner Bros, part of the Time Warner group, now offers on-line
access to some of its recordings through America Online and CompuServe, the
US on-line services.
Geffen Records, a Matsushita subsidiary, also releases material on
CompuServe. This summer it became the first major record company to produce
a CD-Rom game. Geffen joined with Jasmine Multimedia, a small Californian
software house, to create Vid Grid, a visual jigsaw that enables the user to
assemble videos from artistes including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Aerosmith and
Jimi Hendrix.
These projects are still seen as experiments. The current generation of
on-line music services is not sophisticated enough for mainstream use. It
can take as long as 15 minutes to download a three-minute song from IUMA on
the Internet. The sound quality is patchy (more like FM radio than compact
disc) and the visuals limited to black and white.
Some of the new digital diffusers - such as pHreak, a dance music format run
by Intermedia, a multimedia consultancy in London - deliver their services
by computer modem rather than the Internet. This means that pHreak has a
more limited market than the Internet's web of 25m users, but it can make
the most of the vivid colours and sharp definition offered by computer
graphics.
The Internet will become progressively more efficient. Digital junkies will
also soon be able to transfer music to compact discs, rather than cassettes,
with the launch of recordable video-CDs. The expansion of digital cable
radio, now a fledgling medium in the US and UK which relays dozens of
specialist music stations to the home on cable TV connections, will provide
another digital delivery system.
Each home could eventually have its own 'virtual record shop'. The viewer
would be able to order an album by remote control via a digital cable box
fitted to the TV set, pay for it by credit card and record it on to a
compact disc, rather than buying it from a retailer.
However, there is a risk that, rather than benefiting from digital
diffusion, the record companies will be marginalised by it. At present,
their major artistes need them to secure access to their vast retail
distribution systems. If digital diffusion became a major medium, the
artistes might be tempted to break away and handle their own distribution.
There is also the threat that digital diffusion will continue to develop in
its current fragmented form as an underground movement with devastating
consequences for the music industry's revenue.
The first wave of digital diffusers are effectively pirate operations. They
should, in theory, be licensed to 'sell' music by the appropriate industry
authority, such as the UK's Performing Right Society (PRS). They should also
pay royalties to that authority and the record company. Otherwise they could
simply buy one compact disc and send it to be copied by thousands of
subscribers.
The PRS estimates that 'literally hundreds' of on-line services have
surfaced in the UK this year. So far it has been approached by only three
and has licensed one, Cerberus, which received official sanction last week.
'We're not Luddites,' says David Uwemedimo, head of legal affairs. 'We
encourage new technology within the regulatory system. We want to find a
fair way for these new services to pay for their music. We're still working
on it.'
Time is running out. The BPI's research suggests that once people have
access to on-line services such as digital cable radio, their expenditure on
compact discs and cassettes declines dramatically.
'Record companies have historically made a lot of money from distribution
and if they don't act quickly they could lose it,' said Ms John. 'The
problem is that, as usual, technology is moving much faster than the law -
and the industry's process of thought.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses venturing into cyberspace are well advised to observe the
'netiquette' established by the community of researchers and computer
enthusiasts who still dominate most of the 'newsgroups', or special interest
discussion groups, on the Internet.
Rule number one is that any attempt at unsolicited business promotion is
unacceptable, except in areas of the Internet specifically designated for
commercial activity. Violators of this rule are regarded as the on-line
equivalent of vandals who daub buildings with graffiti, and they are likely
to provoke angry responses, known as 'flame mail'.
In extreme cases, this can effectively force violators off the Internet. A
US legal firm, for example, has been ostracised by the Internet community
for posting on thousands of newsgroups messages that advertised its services
to immigrants seeking US visas.
Outraged Net users bombarded the law firm with over 35,000 messages, most of
them complaints, crashing the computer of the local Internet access service
through which the law firm accessed the Internet.
This incident, together with rising concern about the distribution of
sexually explicit messages on the Internet, has created broad debate about
freedom of speech in the world of electronic communications. Until more
specific guidelines are developed, businesses looking for customers on the
Internet should tread carefully.

<LEADPARA>  When John Walker and some fellow computer programmers launched Autodesk Inc.
in 1982, they had a clear plan for every aspect of the business except one:
the products.;    Walker figured that with top-flight programming talent and
the voracious demand for software spurred by the success of the International
Business Machines Personal Computer, the company could just try a bunch of
things and hope one of them worked.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AUTODESK SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY DIVERGENTLY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     And one of them, a computer-aided design package called AutoCAD, not only
worked but became one of the most successful software products in history.
Sausalito-based Autodesk earned a remarkable $43.6 million on sales of $175.6
million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, and AutoCAD has spawned a $1
billion industry of software developers, equipment vendors and dealers devoted
to making personal computers better tools for designing everything from houses
to helicopters.;    But now, Autodesk faces the dicey task of proving that it
is not just another one-trick pony in an industry that already has a string of
them. And in trying to move beyond near-total dependence on a single product
-- a goal that has eluded most software powerhouses, including Lotus
Development, Ashton-Tate and Wordstar International -- Autodesk has set out in
pursuit of some esoteric technologies that most established companies won't go
near.;    Though Autodesk's diversification strategy differs dramatically from
the acquisition-oriented approach of Lotus and other companies, it must
overcome the same basic problem.;    "Software companies get mesmerized by
their market niche," says John Rossi, a software analyst at Robertson,
Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco investment bank. "All their efforts are very
focused, very specialized, so it's hard to send the whole thing down a
different track.";    But if any software company is in a position to do
things differently, it might be idiosyncratic Autodesk. Founded as a
cooperative, Autodesk never accepted venture capital funding, and it thrives
on an informal, egalitarian management style.;    Alvar J. Green, the modest
and cheerful British native who serves as chairman and chief executive,
occupies his post because Walker and the other company founders prefer to
focus on programming.;    "It's not as if I tell people what to do or
anything," he says. "You have to rally people around an idea here.";    It is
fitting, perhaps, that Autodesk's brand of consensus management has yielded an
approach to new markets consistent with Walker's original theory: Try a few
things and see what works. "We're looking for technologies that have unlimited
upside potential, but where we know what the downside will be," Green says.;  
 The company even launched a new-business development unit last month and
invited "interesting project concepts and business plans from any legitimate
source.";    Thus far, Autodesk has identified a handful of such technologies.
The most mainstream of them is multimedia computing, the integration of sound
and video into the personal computer. Many personal computer companies expect
multimedia to be a major growth area in the future, and Autodesk has set up a
new division to market its multimedia products, which so far have met with
limited success.;    On the more daring side is Xanadu, conceived some 20
years ago by computer visionary Ted Nelson as a new way of navigating through
a forest of information. In a Xanadu "hypertext" data base, the information --
including text, video or any other type of data -- would be linked
conceptually by the system, allowing the user to skip freely from one
information source to another without using keyword searches and other
traditional data-base methods.;    Xanadu Operating Co., based in Palo Alto,
had struggled for years to get a product out the door, and few in the business
took it seriously. But Autodesk did and purchased the company in 1988 for an
undisclosed sum.;    Malcolm L. Davies, Autodesk's senior vice president for
marketing, jokes that when Xanadu products are finally shipped -- and the
current goal is sometime this year -- the company will apply to the Guinness
Book of World Records for the longest-running software development project in
history. But if Xanadu does succeed, the potential market is enormous, because
it will vastly simplify and humanize the task of finding information.;   
Similarly out on the edge is Autodesk's cyberspace, or artificial reality,
project. The concept, now being pursued by many large companies, is to create
a completely computer-generated environment. A current version includes a mask
with two small television screens and a set of electronic gloves; one can
actually navigate around a seemingly three-dimensional room and use one's
hands to pick up and move objects.;    Autodesk is aiming to produce a basic
artificial reality operating system, and then software developers would use it
to create "environments" for entertainment, physical fitness or education.
Such a system could also have links to AutoCAD, allowing an architect, for
example, to walk around inside a building that exists only as an AutoCAD
design.;    "It's a simulation technique that complements AutoCAD," said
project director Randal Walser. "We believe an industry is about to emerge."; 
  Autodesk has also purchased minority interests in several small software
companies with interesting product concepts and last year acquired a
competitor in the low-end computer-aided design business. But even with $150
million in cash, Autodesk is not interested in buying established companies to
get into mainstream software markets, such as word processing or spreadsheets.
That is in distinct contrast to other big software companies, such as Lotus,
Ashton-Tate and Wordstar, which have tried -- and mostly failed -- to
diversify by acquiring going businesses.;    To meet its goal of gaining only
half its revenues from computer-aided design products within five years -- the
figure is currently over 90 percent -- Autodesk will need new businesses that
generate hundreds of millions a year.;    Scott Cook, president of Intuit
Software, suggests another, more disquieting reason that software companies
tend to be dependent on one product.;    "They got lucky the first time
around," he suggests. "Instead of victory through internal process and people
doing things right, they got lucky, got there first and got a dominant share."  </TEXT>

   Science and Literature Reconciled

   Literary types have always tended to take a pretty dim
view of science. Their attitudes range from Romantic contempt
-- Wordsworth's "We murder to dissect" -- to the snobbery of
Oxford dandies who used to refer to the subject as "Stinks."
The big gulf between the scientific community and the
humanities crowd, already noted by the
scientist-turned-novelist C.P. Snow in his famous "Two
Cultures" lecture in 1959, has not gotten any smaller.
   "A Literary Guide to Science" (Norton, 517 pages, $24.95)
is the latest ecumenical gesture on the part of science
toward the literary world. Its editor, Walter Gratzer, is a
researcher in biophysics at London University, who must also
have been doing rather a lot of bedtime reading over the
years. Here he has compiled more than 200 excerpts from
novels, memoirs, biographies, plays, reportage and verse,
plus a few complete short stories -- that represent
"incursions of science into literature." Each is preceded by
a pithy introduction. Although the selection is heavily
weighted toward the 20th century, he's not forgotten about
Swift, Pope, Byron, Flaubert and Samuel Butler. There is
almost no science fiction, which by and large is neither very
literary nor very scientific.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A Literary Guide" is well-leavened with comedy, beginning
with an amusing account by James Thurber of his inability to
see absolutely anything through a microscope, to the immense
annoyance of his botany professor. Only after a year of
trying every conceivable adjustment of the instrument did he
finally manage to record an image of "a variegated
constellation of flecks, specks, and dots," which he took for
plant cells until his enraged instructor pointed out that
Thurber had drawn a reflection of his own eye.
   Elsewhere in the book we are treated to the spectacle of
Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe's tame elk imbibing too
much beer and falling fatally down some stairs; of
archbishops struggling with books on relativity theory (only
to be told by Einstein that "it is a purely scientific matter
and has nothing to do with religion"); and of Alexander
Graham Bell trying to get the dying President Garfield to
swallow a light bulb so that the assassin's bullet inside his
body could be located.
   Otherworldly though scientists are reputed to be, here we
see them acting all too human, both in fact and in fiction.
They sabotage one another's experiments, steal credit for
discoveries, bicker about the order of authors' names on
scientific papers, develop neurotic obsessions with the Nobel
Prize, and get duped by psychics; one even pronounces nuclear
as "nucular," just like Jimmy Carter.
   A particularly unattractive physicist named Otto Warburg
accepts the status of "honorary Aryan" from the Nazis so that
he can remain in his Berlin laboratory even though he is half
Jewish. Asked by a journalist how he felt about the charge
that he was "a great scientist but a rotten human being,"
Warburg replied without a twinkle in his eye: "I am glad they
do not say the other way around."
   More appealing is the rounded character portrait drawn of
that towering British physiologist J.B.S. Haldane -- who was
also a classics scholar, an ardent communist, a war hero and
a wag. We are given engaging views of the man from
biographies, memoirs, and from Aldous Huxley's novel "Antic
Hay," in which he was a character. Also included is a
surprisingly good short story by Haldane himself, a dryly
witty thriller about a conspiracy to extract gold from sea
water.
   Pop topics are not scanted by "A Literary Guide." Those
who have forgotten about Kurt Vonnegut's "ice-nine" will find
a brief refresher from his "Cat's Cradle," plus another
account by Mr. Vonnegut of how the idea for this
ocean-congealing substance was first offered by a General
Electric scientist to H.G. Wells, who declined to make
fictional use of it. Wilhelm Reich's notorious orgone box,
which was supposed to do everything from healing wounds to
improving orgasms, gets sent up by that great puncturer of
science frauds, Martin Gardner.
   Mr. Gratzer admits that he may have omitted worthy stuff
due to ignorance, but how did he come to ignore Joyce and
Nabokov? Did science touch their writing? It did. Nabokov's
memoirs include a marvelous account of his scientific
fascination with butterflies. Joyce devoted an entire episode
of "Ulysses" to the theme of science and coined the term
"quark" (used by physicists to denote the basic building
blocks of matter) in "Finnegans Wake."
   There are sins of commission as well as omission: Many of
the excerpts Mr. Gratzer has included from forgotten
scientific novels are too brief to achieve critical mass, and
are written in less than delicious prose. But the average is
pushed up well above the purchase threshold by literary gems
from the likes of Primo Levi, Michael Frayn and John Updike,
who plainly knows as much about contemporary physics as he
does about Kierkegaard and funky sex. With items such as his
charming bit of doggerel about neutrinos streaming through
the bodies of lovers in Nepal, this guide ought to keep even
the most jaded literary aesthete amused.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (20): Advances in large scale
storage - Raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAID stands for 'redundant array of inexpensive discs,' a term coined by
computer scientists at the University of California in 1987 and now
increasingly embodied in disc storage products for systems of all sizes.
However, significant advances in disc technology since 1987 have complicated
the RAID argument just as manufacturers are expanding their RAID offerings
from office systems into the mainframe computer market.
The original research aimed to ease a problem caused by increases in
computer speed. Processors were held back by the time it took to access data
stored on electro-mechanical discs systems.
So researchers replaced a single large disc with several smaller ones.
Performance improved, because several drives were working simultaneously on
recording or retrieving a piece of information.
However, increasing the number of discs also heightened the risk of failure
of the total system. Traditional mass storage discs (known as SLED for
'single large expensive discs') were far more reliable than the 5.25-inch
disc drives of 1987, which typically broke down once every 25,000 hours:
this meant that an array of 10 would hit a problem every 14 weeks.
The researchers therefore built in redundancy, so that a problem in one
drive would not bring down the entire system. They specified what they
called five RAID levels, later expanded to seven. Some have been largely
discarded because of their impact on performance.
TWO BROAD TYPES
The RAID levels fall into two broad types: one involves recording all data
simultaneously on two discs, so that one is an exact copy of the other. This
is known as disc mirroring or shadowing. Data retrieval is faster than on
single discs because data is retrieved from both discs at once. If one disc
fails, the system continues without interruption, because all the data is
still available.
The other RAID technique is known as striping: here data is recorded, or
'striped,' across the array of discs. If one disc fails, the system can work
out the lost data by performing arithmetic on check digits stored with
related data on the other discs.
In some RAID striping levels the check data is stored on a disc of its own.
Recovering the lost data can take 20 minutes or more in a big system and,
while the recovery is going on, the performance of the overall system is
significantly affected.
Side benefits of RAID systems include the fact that they use less power and
generate less heat than traditional large disc drives. They also occupy less
floor space: the disc drives, typically placed on top of each other, are
standard 3.5 or 5.25-inch units found in personal computers, compared with
the traditional big discs measuring up to 14 inches.
Most RAID suppliers have focused initially on networked PCs and business
minicomputers, typically Unix machines and the IBM AS/400. Supplier
Hewlett-Packard says the PC market in particular is receptive to the RAID
idea.
'PC users expect disc drives to fail and are accustomed to cheap,
low-capacity, keep-a-couple-of-spares-handy units,' the company says.
'They are also likely to see disc drives, like PCs, as commodities and buy
on this basis rather than worrying about a quality system from a big-name
supplier.
'In addition, PC data tends not to get backed up regularly: the network is
typically a part-time responsibility for one person in the office. Users
therefore see RAID offering protection against failure and reducing the need
for back-up.'
Most manufacturers are only just launching RAID products in the mainframe
market, partly because here the PC arguments are all reversed.
Computing managers expect disc systems to have high reliability, capacity
and performance; they also have specialists whose jobs include regular
back-ups.
However, EMC Computer Systems, which has been in the mainframe market since
1990 with a RAID level one disc mirroring system, believes that disc
technology has progressed so quickly that debates about which RAID levels
are best have become irrelevant.
The company supports its case by pointing to the fact that after three years
it has become the third biggest supplier of mainframe disc storage, with a
15 per cent market share. EMC director Mr David Facer says that the
reliability of small discs has leapt to between 0.5m and 0.8m hours between
failures.
Simultaneously, capacities of these discs have increased from 200 megabytes
(1m characters) when the RAID research was being done to 2,000 megabytes or
more today. These figures mean that an array of 10 discs, equalling the
capacity of a single big mainframe disc drive, should only break down only
once every six to nine years. Indeed, EMC is so confident about today's disc
drives that the RAID level one mirroring feature is merely an option: the
disc redundancy issue is removed altogether. Instead, EMC uses fast
electronic memory to provide fail-safe facilities. Such memory is
increasingly being built into disc systems to hold frequently-used data and
thus reduce the need to access electro-mechanical disc storage.
Studies from research firm IDC support Mr Facer when he argues that the
falling cost of disc drives has brought the price of mirrored systems down
to that of striped systems, especially when the extra costs and performance
overheads of controlling the striping are taken into account.
Demand for data storage is said to be growing at 40 per cent a year. As more
and more information goes on-line, demand for faster and faster access is
likely to increase.
As Mr Facer puts it: 'The issue isn't about RAID: it's about
high-performance reliable storage at the right price.'

INNOVATION: CYBERPUNK AND THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For people who adore Norman Rockwell art, Reader's Digest and mayonnaise, John 
Naisbitt's best-selling "Megatrends 2000" offers tantalizing insights into the 
future. People who prefer to shock their neurons with obscure ethnic cuisines 
and Mapplethorpe photography are better off reading cyberpunk -- a genre that 
completely redefines the ecology of technology and the technology of ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Cyberpunk is science fiction with an attitude; glossily dystopian visions of 
pop cultures dissolving in the sleaze of their own technologies. Characters 
"jack on" to global networks of computer-generated artificial realities; 
technology isn't a creation of a scientifically trained elite but of 
disillusioned masses and greedy entrepreneurs groping for new media to get 
high. "The street finds its own uses for things" is a cyberpunk motto. Crack is 
a cyberpunk-like phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain central themes spring up repeatedly in cyberpunk," notes Bruce 
Sterling, the Texas-based cyberpunk polemicist who edited the popular 
"Mirrorshades" anthology. "The theme of body invasion: prosthetic limbs, 
implanted circuitry, cosmetic surgery, genetic alteration. The even more 
powerful theme of mind invasion: brain-computer interfaces, artificial 
intelligence, neurochemistry -- techniques radically redefining the nature of 
humanity, the nature of self." 
</P>
<P>
These themes are crammed into densely intricate prose that creates, in 
Sterling's metaphor, "the literary equivalent of the hard-rock 'wall of sound' 
" designed to pummel the reader with imagery that alternately stimulates the 
imagination and depresses the spirit. Picture a Tom Clancy embittered by the 
technology about which he now rhapsodizes and amplify the intensity of that 
prose a few thousand volts and you have a glimmer of what the cyberpunk genre 
is like. 
</P>
<P>
But scrape through the layers of metaphor and post-Modern posturing by the 
cyberpunks (they're called "Techno-Goths" in England) and you find some 
jaggedly profound insights -- the sort of insights that Naisbittesque futurists 
don't see and can't grasp. 
</P>
<P>
In cyberpunk, human beings are analog machines of flesh and neurochemicals that 
can be engineered, edited and transformed into fleshy nodes on cyberspace 
networks. People meld into the machinery. By contrast, the machinery -- the 
networks, computers and gloomily engineered urban landscapes -- are eerily 
organic. They are almost living things. They're the "natural" environment. They 
recall the line from Buckminster Fuller -- who was anything but a cynical 
cyberpunk -- that "natural is whatever nature allows." 
</P>
<P>
Cyberpunk takes Fuller's definition of nature right to the edge and beyond. In 
cyberpunk worlds, the lines between "natural" and "artificial" become arbitrary 
to the point of meaningless. Technology isn't something distinct from the 
environment or a part of the environment -- the technology is the environment; 
it's every bit as "natural" as a blade of grass or a drop of (acid) rain. 
</P>
<P>
Is a human being less "natural" because he or she wears eyeglasses or needs to 
be hooked up to a dialysis machine? Are farms more "natural" than cities -- or 
is the technique of agriculture itself an unnatural act? Psychotropic drugs and 
infectious diseases are "natural," aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
If a city depends on freeways and automobiles to provide for its citizens, are 
automobiles a natural or unnatural technology? When we talk about "The 
Environment" and "The Ecology," do we mean a pre-Industrial Age kind of 
ecology, or do we mean an environment robust enough to cope with both the 
benefits and excesses of technology? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most contemporary fiction, the cyberpunk genre cynically reminds us that 
our notions of environment and ecology are purely arbitrary and fantastical; 
the word "natural" has been leeched of any real meaning. We live in a world 
where we seem to define "natural" as the absence of technology. But, as William 
Gibson, widely considered the father of the cyberpunk movement, says, "Where 
can you go today in the world where the environment isn't affected by human 
technology? . . . The bill is coming due on that first hundred years of 
industrialization." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, of course, is that building things is what we do. Man is often 
described as homo faber -- man the toolmaker. It's as natural for us to make 
tools as it is for birds to sing and plankton to recycle oxygen. We can't help 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that Nature pristine is what's ecologically "correct" and that man is 
the ruthless despoiler of once-vibrant ecosystems is sheer lunacy. Quite 
frankly, the societies on this earth that lack technology seem to endure life 
rather than enjoy it. These societies may be more ecologically "correct" than 
Los Angeles or Des Moines -- but so what? Our technologies are a part of the 
ecosystem. The question is, what kind of part do we want them to play? 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez "Shucks, folks, it was an accident. Sorry about that -- will 
you take a check?" attitude is disgusting. It displays contempt for the very 
idea of ecological balance. But does the Valdez disaster mean that society is 
inherently wrong to consume fossil fuels? Greenpeace and EarthFirst! might say 
yes. I would say no. The idea that we're evolving into a post-industrial 
agrarian economy where we stay home and chew our cuds and telecommute via our 
personal computers is bonkers. 
</P>
<P>
Events such as Earth Day and all the assorted hoopla beg some very fundamental 
questions: Is the "environmental movement" dedicated toward a more intelligent, 
more rational approach to management of waste products? Or is it a lifestyle 
movement that seeks to radically alter consumption? Or is it an anti-technology 
movement that wants to eliminate the pace of technical change? Or is it less a 
question of ecology than geopolitics -- a struggle between Northern wealth and 
Southern poverty? 
</P>
<P>
"Ecology is about to become a political commodity," says cyberpunker Sterling, 
who points out that much of the movement is "preservationist and 
conservationist; there's a siege mentality. The battle has to be taken to the 
enemy, which is the urban environments with their slabs of concrete and toxin 
production." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, break up the cities. No thank you. My view is as apolitical as 
possible: We should avoid making a mess and quickly clean up when we do. The 
irony here, as Gibson and Sterling point out, is that we need technology to 
measure, track and clean up the messes that other technologies make. 
</P>
<P>
No matter which way we turn -- be it greenhouse effect management, solar and 
geothermal energy generation or a new era of biodegradables/recyclables -- we 
are going to be in a shotgun marriage with technology. The cyberpunks paint 
worlds where that marriage is as hellishly oppressive as anything a post-Modern 
Dante could conjure up. But, in the real world, shotgun marriages don't have to 
be unhappy or end in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have to grit their teeth and learn to accept that human 
technology is as natural as snowfall in the mountains. Technologists have to 
understand that, unlike a generation ago, they can't escape the messes that 
they have helped create -- so they better prevent them or do a far better job 
of cleaning them up. Things will still get worse before they get better. But 
they will get better.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Dollars 1m to give away - in cyber-bucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: 10,000 cyber-junkies to participate in an experiment to test a new
electronic payment system specially designed for use on the Internet. Each
volunteer is required to spend Dollars 100 in cyber-bucks during the
experiment.
DigiCash, an Amsterdam-based company that specialises in developing new
electronic cash payment systems, has invented a form of digital money with
which people can pay for products or services bought on the Internet, the
international system of computer networks.
Mr David Chaum, a former academic who taught at University of California and
New York University before becoming managing director of DigiCash, said the
digital payment system - dubbed E-Cash - had been devised for use by
conventional banks as an alternative form of payment on the Internet that
protects the privacy of the user.
DigiCash has for the past week been operating E-Cash on an experimental
basis. A number of commercial companies, including Encyclopedia Britannica
and Wired, the technology magazine, are participating in the trial by
allowing the DigiCash volunteers to pay for their products in apocryphal
'cyber-bucks' using the E-Cash system.
During the trial DigiCash is giving away a total of Dollars 1m in
cyber-bucks to up to 10,000 volunteers, each of whom will be allowed to
spend Dollars 100. Each participant can withdraw their Dollars 100 from the
DigiCash 'bank' in 'digital coins', each of which is in the form of a
numerical code.
If the volunteers want to access an article from Wired on the Internet, they
pay for it with digital coins. Wired then verifies that the payment is valid
by checking the numerical code of each 'coin' with the DigiCash bank through
the Internet. If the bank approves, the purchase goes ahead.
DigiCash hopes that commercial banks will offer E-Cash as an alternative to
their standard payment systems. Mr Chaum said he hoped soon to conclude
negotiations with a UK bank which is interested in introducing E-Cash. A
conventional bank would operate the system in the same way as the DigiCash
bank in the trial.
Commercial transactions on the Internet are currently paid for with bank
debit or credit cards. The main advantage of the E-Cash format to users is
that it enables them to conduct their Internet transactions in privacy.
The numerical code on each digital coin is calculated according to a
mathematical formula devised by DigiCash. This ensures that the bank sees a
scrambled version of the user's original code and therefore, although it
validates each 'coin', it does not monitor individual transactions.
So far the E-Cash trial is going very well, according to DigiCash. After
only one week on-line it has signed up 1,000 volunteers and new recruits are
flooding in at the rate of 80 or 90 a day.

FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology: The smaller the better - Computers the size of a
sugar lump are on the way thanks to nanotechnology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a technology that allows you to manipulate a single atom and place
it precisely in a specific position - a technology that promises to affect
virtually every aspect of our world.
Scientists exploring nanotechnology are working on a scale 500 times smaller
than today's advanced computer chips. The ability to manipulate individual
atoms would mean that a computer with more power and more memory than the
combined capacity of all the computers ever produced could be made no bigger
than a lump of sugar.
But how can scientists pick up a single atom and place it in a precise
location? Researchers believe the answer could lie in adapting the
relatively new and extremely powerful atomic force microscope. This device
uses a diamond with a single atom at its tip to take pictures of atoms based
on the electronic forces between them.
Researchers have found that when using the microscope they can also move
individual atoms. IBM's Almaden Research Laboratories in California used an
atomic force microscope to place individual xenon atoms on a nickel surface
to spell IBM.
Eric Drexler, who coined the term nanotechnology in the mid-1980s and is the
author of the book Nanosystems, believes that atomic force microscopes can
be adapted to be efficient manipulators of individual atoms.
'It will be an enabling technology if we can develop atomic force
microscopes that 'grip' an atom and not only position it but also rotate
it,' Drexler says. Current research is focused on adapting the microscope.
However, building a product atom by atom using an atomic force microscope
would be an incredibly slow process. Researchers have proposed building
molecular machines invisible to the naked eye to do the manipulating.
Ralph Merkle, a researcher in nanotechnology at the California-based Xerox
Palo Alto Research Centre, believes the potential applications are great.
'If we can create a manufacturing technology that can precisely manipulate
individual atoms, we can improve virtually every product made,' he says.
Scientists believe that the first applications for such technology are
likely to be in medicine and surgery. Molecular machines could be injected
into the body to seek out and kill diseased cells and repair delicate
organs.
Researchers also believe there will be defence applications, such as the
development of new weapons systems and lightweight hardware.
Merkle believes that nanotechnology will usher in the Diamond Age, an age as
important as Stone, Bronze, Iron and Silicon. 'Diamond is 50 times stronger
than steel, it is light, it makes an excellent semiconductor, its heat
conduction is excellent. It is the all-round ideal material,' he says.
How far away are the promises of nanotechnology? Drexler believes 'it may be
15 to 20 years away'. He adds: 'We are talking about a technology that is
inevitable, a technology that will have a greater impact than the industrial
revolution on a much shorter timescale, yet we are doing nothing to prepare
for it.'
Merkle is optimistic about development prospects: 'I don't know when we will
have these capabilities, but if you take a look at how quickly chip
manufacturers are shrinking their chip designs, and you look at the rate
that manufacturing technologies are improving their resolution, and you
consider the rate at which power consumption of individual transistors is
declining; if you chart these rates as straight lines, they all converge in
the 2010 to 2020 timeframe.'
In the meantime, nanotechnology researchers are busy designing the computers
and molecular machines that they believe will be built one day.
Nanotechnology research is being carried out by small groups of scientists
around the world. Japan recently began a 10-year, Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m)
research programme. But so far there has been no large-scale organised
effort, despite what some researchers see as its great promise.
Commercial interest is growing in the subject, and the northern California
area is emerging as a focal point for commercial and academic work.
Nanothinc, a San Francisco based company was recently formed to disseminate
information on nanotechnology and to help identify investment opportunities.
Paul Green, Nanothinc chairman, describes nanotechnology as 'the mother of
all technologies'. But right now it is a technology that is attempting the
difficult transition from the theoretical to the practical.
Eric Drexler, while optimistic about development, is also concerned about
the wider impact on trade, jobs and economies of a technology that could
make virtually any product 100 times cheaper and with a quality at least 10
times better. 'Nanotechnology is inevitable. There is no one arguing that it
won't happen. Therefore we must begin to plan on its use and how it will
change our societies.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (6): Striking the
right Notes for the future / A look at the impact of Groupware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTER software industry has been promising to change the way people
work for the past decade. Sceptics might suggest the aim has been achieved,
but only in terms of expense and frustrated users. Enter Groupware.
Groupware is a term coined to embrace programs for people working in teams.
It provides an infrastructure to co-ordinate individuals in the group, while
ensuring the concurrence of data relating to their work. Members of the
group can be scattered across continents. But when they turn to their
software environment, the very latest information from all involved is right
there.
Groupware offers a godsend to large organisations tackling the logistics of
teamwork. The concept has taken off, with Lotus Notes first on the beach.
Notes sits on one dedicated PC which serves up to 50 users. This central
core holds material which users summon up, seeing the latest change to the
project across the network. Lotus began selling Notes licences for batches
of 200 users upwards. The entry investment, at Pounds 200 per user, was
Pounds 40,000.
The appeal was dramatic, with blue chip companies buying licences by the
thousand. In the last 12 months the user base has grown exponentially. By
March 1992 Lotus had sold 117,000 licences worldwide. Industry sources
suggest that this figure now stands at 500,000.
Notes answers many administrative headaches. Use it for conferencing and it
boosts productivity by avoiding duplication of effort. A centrally held
diary can fix meetings in one shot, rather than the familiar round of phone
calls via secretaries requiring a dozen cancelled appointments before one
convenient day can be established.
But it does have limitations. The dedicated server must run IBM's OS/2
operating system which is greedy in terms of space on a machine and is
primarily established among very large corporate users. Each group hangs off
one server, but co-ordinating that server to others to form a constellation
of workgroups is not easy. A release for the Unix operating system, offering
vastly improved networking capabilities, is imminent.
Management consultants KPMG recently conducted a survey covering 10,000 UK
Notes users. The principal problem encountered was actual communication of
what Notes does. Within large organisations senior managers still have
reservations about whether Notes is worthwhile.
The computer industry can blame itself for this. Groupware arrived in a
blaze of jargon. Workflow, a term that has as many definitions as it has
adherents, is a typical Groupware spin-off. It refers to monitoring
individual effort and directing the user so as to optimise time and effort.
But the term is so imprecise that it serves to confuse.
To use Groupware, a company must be comfortable with team structures. There
is little point installing Notes if the users work in a fractious
environment. Groupware is suited to professional harmony.
But corporations that have embraced Notes have gone for it in a big way.
General Motors has bought nearly 30,000 licences for Notes, through its IT
arm, Electronic Data Systems. Mr Mike Thompson, an EDS manager attached to
GM in the UK, is impressed. 'It's been phenomenal. The user perception is
extremely positive.'
A typical GM application is shipping pictures of parts around across Europe
to ensure that they are produced exactly to their original specification.
And it is evidence of the quality of graphics with Notes.
GM is prepared to entrust Notes with a critical role in maintaining
engineering standards. But the GM world already consisted of a massive IT
infrastructure and the trained staff to use it. Mr Thompson warns that
without this investment Notes will not deliver. 'You must take account of
the support aspect. You do need a network in place.'
BP Oil employs Notes as the framework for its emergency response system. If
an oil leak occurs in Germany, staff across Europe consult Notes for site
plans, technical diagrams and up-to-the-minute strategies.
Notes maintains information on health and safety rules and their
implications for the oil sector on a system that can be accessed by BP staff
across the continent.
Lotus has certainly gained acceptance for Groupware with Notes. But there
are other products that do a similar job. Why has Lotus Notes emerged from
the PC world to eclipse steady performers like Verimation's Memo or the new
Co-operation program from NCR?
Mr Richard Lavender, a senior consultant at systems house Logica, describes
the rise of Notes as 'a confidence trick in the nicest possible way.' The
market presence of Lotus as a reputable supplier of PC software was
critical. 'People knew who Lotus were and they already had Lotus products
under their belt.' And the sales strategy of going straight for large users
has produced influential enthusiasts.
Verimation's Memo range grew out of an electronic mail system for Volvo. It
tends to thrive in mainframe environments where a lot of users need to pull
down and share corporate data. Mr Bruno Giversen, Verimation vice-president,
admits that both products have their strengths, and can be complementary.
'Memo is much cheaper, but rightly so because Notes has more database
facilities.'
Abbey National's new life insurance wing uses a mainframe based Memo system
to co-ordinate its PC environment. NCR's Co-operation ties together elements
of an existing IT infrastructure. The idea is to maintain the hardware
investment but control staff working locally within the overall wide area
network. It is a development environment that can be altered to suit
individual businesses, offering a shot at the elusive prize of 'competitive
advantage'.
National &amp; Provincial Building Society is implementing Co-operation to keep
documents flowing between teams. A typical price for a 100-user installation
would be Pounds 77,000.
Mr Kenny MacIver, a software analyst at International Data Corporation, has
made an exhaustive study of the mass migration to Notes. He concludes
Groupware is here to stay. 'Notwithstanding its obvious limitations, Notes
is a glimpse of the future. Where there is a need to share data and
co-ordinate group activity, there's going to be a need for such a package.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Queen's broadcast goes on Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas television is going to be launched in cyberspace for the first
time on Christmas day with the Queen's broadcast leading the way.
In what is claimed to be the first rudimentary television schedule to be
transmitted on the Internet global computer network, a London consultancy
called Intervid is offering three hours of programmes.
After the midday launch fanfare, the Christmas schedule will get under way
with Xmas With the First Family - breakfast with Mr and Mrs Clinton courtesy
of the White House pages of the Internet World Wide Web.
Then it is Herbie Hancock live from Japan via a feed from NHK, the Japanese
broadcaster. The Queen will be broadcast later - one minute after the real
thing.
Internet users with special software - CU-SeeMe - will be able to see the
schedule with the majority of viewers likely to be in California and Japan.
University College London has helped by making bandwidth available to the
service.

software company - after its arch-rival Microsoft - drives a pick-up truck
to work in Provo, Utah, and decorates his offices with folksy Norman
Rockwell prints inscribed with uplifting mottoes.
A more unlikely adversary of Bill Gates, the testy, boyish multi-billionaire
chairman of Microsoft is hard to imagine. Yet 'Mr Nice Guy' Noorda, has
shown that beneath the amiable exterior lies a determination to influence
the direction of the computer industry. And that means putting Gates in his
place.
This week, it emerged that Novell has filed an anti-trust complaint against
Microsoft with European Community competition authorities. Novell has also
played an active role, behind the scenes, in providing information to US
authorities, leading to a justice department anti-trust probe of Microsoft.
Clearly rattled, Gates has lashed out at Noorda. 'He has a tremendous
vendetta against us. Novell has made a conscious decision to spread lies
about us,' he has charged.
Responding calmly, Noorda says: 'We have felt that Microsoft has broken
certain principles or codes of doing business. Wherever we see unfair
practices . . . particularly if we feel they are injurious to the industry
at large, we will probably complain to the recognised authorities.'
Noorda defers to his lawyers on details of the complaint to the EC, which
alleges Microsoft has abused its dominant market position in personal
computer operating systems to restrict competition.
He is, however, forthright on the principle involved. 'Competition is
absolutely necessary for anybody to improve what they are doing. So it
wouldn't be good either for Microsoft or for the industry if they were to
achieve a monopoly.'
Gates 'is not a bad guy, he is a young guy,' Noorda adds. 'In my more than
40 years in the industry I have not met a bunch like them. They are
possessive, aggressive and strong challengers, but they are afraid of
head-on competition and that is anathema to me.'
Noorda's outlook has been shaped by attempts to compete with Microsoft in
the market for PC operating systems. Novell charges that Microsoft protects
its share of this segment of the software business - more than 90 per cent -
through restrictive licensing schemes.
Adding fuel to perceptions of uncompetitive trading is the abortive merger
plan between the two companies, initiated by Gates last year, which was
called off when Microsoft acquired another software company without telling
Novell. Noorda says: 'I don't know what their motives were. I can only
speculate. But perhaps they were trying to slow us down.'
Noorda warns that computer users do not benefit if one company - be it
Microsoft or IBM - becomes so dominant that it can dictate 'how the game is
played'.
During a career which began in the era of punch cards, Noorda believes the
most significant technological change has been the emergence of the
'networking environment' in which different types of computer are linked
throughout an organisation, sharing information and processing tasks.
'Today, the customers demand that everything has to work together,' Noorda
says. 'That means that everyone in the computer industry has to work
together. We have tried to make a successful business out of working with
companies who would otherwise be called our competitors.'
Noorda has coined the word 'co-opetition' to describe the complex
relationships which can bring competitors to share, for example, technical
details of forthcoming products to ensure that they work together. 'We feel
that he who will co-operate the most with competitors will be the
longer-term survivor,' Noorda says.
This does not mean Noorda is a push over. Indeed, Novell is one of the few
companies in the software industry that has gone head to head with Microsoft
and won.
Since he acquired Novell 10 years ago, Noorda has transformed what was a
failing computer company into the leading supplier of software for personal
computer networks, with more than 70 per cent of the world market. Turnover
has increased from Dollars 3.8m in 1983 to Dollars 933m for its fiscal year
ended October 31 1992.
In the process, Noorda, with about 11 per cent of Novell's stock, has become
a billionaire. But money does not seem to excite him. Until last year he
drew a modest salary of Dollars 38,000 a year, preferring, he said, to spend
money on hiring. The board of directors forced him to raise his salary to
Dollars 198,000 after Wall Street observers suggested his commitment to the
company might appear to be in doubt.
Since he took over at Novell, Noorda has acquired 15 smaller companies,
expanding Novell's technology base and demonstrating a rare ability
successfully to manage mergers. The largest acquisition, completed in June,
with the Dollars 322m purchase of Unix System Laboratories, a former AT&amp;T
subsidiary, may stretch those skills. Assimilating USL's employees is a
challenge, Noorda concedes. The recent departure of Roel Pieper, former
president and chief executive of USL and a respected industry executive, for
'personal reasons', hints at how difficult the adjustment may be.
The purchase of USL will also test Noorda's 'co-opetition' philosophy.
Novell now controls Unix, the widely used computer operating system. This
makes Noorda the referee in an industry-wide feud over competing versions of
the program. The acquisition also places Novell in head-to-head competition
with Microsoft's latest Windows NT, an advanced computer operating system
that represents Microsoft's bid to expand beyond PCs.
As Novell and Microsoft's ambitions increasingly overlap, the potential for
conflict increases. Yet Noorda insists he is not aiming to depose Microsoft
as the industry leader. 'Our motivation is not to own the industry, not to
be the biggest company necessarily, but to accelerate the growth of the
industry,' he says. 'That is our best chance for survival in this intensely
competitive business.'
It is this competitive challenge that seems to motivate Noorda. He has no
plans to retire, he says, although he plans to name his successor at Novell
later this year. 'I'll expire before I retire,' he quips. 'I hope to
continue to be involved with Novell for a long time.' And for that long
Microsoft is likely to feel the heat.

   The high-flying portable computer market will
soar to greater heights through the wizardry of notebook-sized
machines, tiny color screens and images that ``float,'' industry
experts predict.
   Not everyone goes so far as New York retailer James V. Cosby,
who flatly predicted Tuesday: ``They are going to replace
desktops.''
   But from one-pound ``palmtops'' to 20-pounders, there's no doubt
about the sales portables are racking up, or the attention they are
drawing at this year's Comdex convention, the world's biggest
computer show.
   The overall personal computer market is growing about 10 percent
a year. But sales of portables are expected to triple that growth
rate for the next three years, and sales of machines in the
8{-by-11-inch ``notebook'' format will more than quadruple,
predicted Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative
Strategies International and a leading Silicon Valley consultant.
   About 300,000 portables were shipped in the United States in
1983, the first year true portables were available, he said at a
panel discussion.
   Bajarin expects shipments of 1.4 million this year and 2.5
million by 1992.
   Perhaps hottest of all at the show are Compaq Computer Corp.'s
six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines. They are the
first of their size to accept 3{-inch floppy disks which are now
standard for desktop computers.
   Compaq officials say their new models are more convenient than
other machines which use tiny memory cards or smaller disks _
although makers of other models contend the cards are tomorrow's
technology.
   Compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the
month since they introduced the two machines. The LTE begins at
about $2,400. The LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286
microprocessor, lists for $3,900 to $5,000.
   Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers are
the Toshiba T1000SE and NEC's Ultralite, a pioneer when it was
introduced a year ago. The Ultralite weighs just 4.4 pounds, has a
bigger screen than the LTE's, and costs about the same. Storage of
information is on memory cards.
   Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops or
breast pocket computers. Atari's Portfolio, which operates on two
AA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for
$400. Not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins,
it has five simple built-in programs.
   At about $2,000, Poqet Computer Corp.'s palmtop offers a bigger
screen and keyboard, all within the tiny package.
   ``Our computer now uses about the same amount of power as a
single Christmas tree twinkle light,'' meaning it can run for 100
hours on two AA alkaline batteries, said Poquet's president, Stave
Prodromou.
   Near the other extreme is Dolch Computer Systems' ``portable''
that uses Intel's new 80486 microprocessor _ the hottest, most
powerful chip in the world for personal computers.
   The industrial-looking Dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds, but the
company says it can compete in performance with very high-end
desktop computers and work stations. Its price is hefty, too: about
$13,000 to $18,000.
   Also on display was a laptop called Gridpad. It uses a pen-like
device to ``write'' on a document-sized screen, allowing forms to
be filled out and even signed on a computer screen.
   Cyberspace's laptop does away with a screen in favor of headgear
that projects a hologram-like image that seems to hang in the air
in front of the user. It's pitched as a boon for the
security-conscious; no one can look over your shoulder and see what
you're writing or reading.

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- A woman's hands skip across the table
top. A video camera overhead captures her movements,
displaying them on the screen in front of her. Her hands (or,
more precisely, the image of her hands) are squeezing a big
swatch of red. She molds the red blob into a statue, working
her hands vigorously. Then just as the blob takes the shape
of a head, the woman spreads her five fingers, and -- presto]
-- the electronic sculpture disappears.
   She stretches out her left hand and cocks her index
finger. Then the image of the finger taps an icon, or
command, on the screen. Suddenly, her finger is acting like a
paint gun. She is electronically finger-painting, etching
lines onto the screen.

   "This is the dream computer," she says, jumping to her
feet. "This is the most natural thing I've ever seen."
   Welcome to VideoPlace, where video cameras, computers and
TV screens combine to create an artificial world in which
people can work and play with realistic computer animations.
VideoPlace is the system created by Myron W. Krueger, a
49-year-old computer scientist with a taste for performance
art. For nearly a quarter-century, Mr. Krueger has
entertained both artists and scientists with demonstrations
of what he calls artificial reality -- "a graphic fantasy
world in which a person uses her whole body to participate in
an experience created by the computer."
   The experience is achieved either by donning electronic
clothing that feeds sounds and images to the senses or by
entering spaces that are specially outfitted with cameras,
displays and computers. When properly programmed -- and when
the computers are constantly updated with fresh information
-- these systems produce the illusion of actual situations.
   A recent Krueger demonstration of VideoPlace was at the
prestigious Association of Computing Machinery's annual
graphics meeting here. But he's just as likely to turn up at
a gathering of artists. In the early '70s, he first showed
examples of VideoPlace in art galleries, where patrons were
asked to stand before video cameras and "touch" the video
images of other people. The reaction astonished participants,
including Mr. Krueger, who himself felt a wonderful tingle
when he initially embraced a friend electronically.
   The encounter, which occurred several years before the
advent of video games and personal computers, sent Mr.
Krueger on a quest to discover novel ways of blending
computers and performance, entertainment and education, work
and play.
   "I wanted to do great art, great science and great
business -- all in one," he recalls.
   At bottom, he hoped to make computers fun. That didn't sit
well with the computer establishment, which mistrusted Mr.
Krueger even though he holds a doctorate in computer science.
To the digital priesthood, computers in those days weren't
pleasure machines but super-calculators, imposing monoliths
that filled rooms and required dozens of attendants. Created
out of the crucible of the Second World War, computers were
first used to figure the trajectory of gunfire, crack enemy
codes and help in the construction of atomic bombs. By the
late 1960s, computers had gone civilian, but they still
seemed menacing, what with talk about how these machines
would "obsolete" many jobs and someday outwit man himself.
   Mr. Krueger was an unlikely rebel against the computer
establishment. His father was an executive of International
Businss Machines Corp., the world's largest computer maker
and the epitome of "square" in the experimental 1960s. A
graduate of Dartmouth, Mr. Krueger had prep-school manners
and dressed as though he had stepped out of an L.L. Bean
catalog. After a stint in the Army, where he managed a
computer network that left his superiors thoroughly
intimidated, he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin,
determined to change the image of computers.
   "People were afraid of computers," Mr. Krueger remembers.
"I was reacting against that. I wanted to tell people
computers could be different. I thought {I could prove that
to people} if I could just give them a five-minute experience
that left them with a warm feeling with computers."
   But how? The answer was interactivity. Why not play with
computers? The notion appealed to Mr. Krueger, who believed
artists should embrace new media rather than ignore technical
changes. He learned of work by Ivan Sutherland, Douglas
Englebart and J.C. Licklider, who separately showed how
computers, while great number crunchers, could also create
images, which could in turn be used as a means of control and
communication.
   These researchers built systems around terminals,
keyboards, pointing devices and even tiny TV screens built
into eyeglasses. Mr. Krueger preferred a different
"interface" -- the body's own movements, as recorded by a
camera hooked into a computer that was programmed to respond
in prescribed ways to images.
   Mr. Krueger thought it crucial to put the body at the
center of computing; otherwise, ordinary people would find
computers sterile. He recalls: "If you're going to use a
computer all day, every day -- which I foresaw in the 1960s
-- you get a lousy computer interface, you get a lousy life.
So making it pleasant, making it comfortable, was how to do
it."
   Mr. Krueger's basic insight, on which he has elaborated in
two books on artificial reality, hit many researchers like a
lightning bolt. "He's a hero of mine," says Randall Walser,
who heads an artificial-reality project at Autodesk Inc., a
software company. "His {first} book was a tremendous
influence on me. It changed my head around."
   Most important, Mr. Krueger's work convinced a vanguard of
designers that the keyboard and the pointing device weren't
the only ways of controlling computers. VideoPlace "is such a
stunningly simple idea: using your hands themselves to do
stuff," says Brenda Laurel, a researcher in Menlo Park,
Calif. "You can't ignore the power of direct manipulation."
   And the hands are only a beginning. "Arms, feet, legs --
any part of the body will do," says John Vincent John, an
exponent of Mr. Krueger's version of artificial reality. "The
idea is to place a person in an animation and allow them to
interact with it."
   Mr. John, a musician, initially combined video cameras and
a personal computer to enhance his own performances in the
mid-1980s. Later, his company, Vivid Group in Toronto,
developed programs that enabled participants to stand before
a camera and see (and hear) themselves performing on
imaginary instruments that appeared on the screen. As they
moved their hands, the participants could see (and hear) the
instruments respond to the image of their hands on the
screen.
   Recently, museums, theme parks and even some corporations
have installed systems. Vivid Group devised for B.F. Goodrich
an imaginary tour through the tire maker's history. A viewer,
standing before a video camera, could see, for example, an
assembly line on a computer screen and by maneuvering his
hand watch himself on the screen pluck a tire from the line.
   Despite growing appreciation for artificial reality, Mr.
Krueger has yet to profit much from it. "Somewhere along the
line," he quips, "I got vaccinated against money."
   Mr. Krueger, who lives in Storrs, Conn., earns a meager
living from a grab bag of consulting jobs and an occasional
philanthropic grant. He has never received lavish support
from any corporation, despite frequent nibbles, and blames
his relative neglect on the shortsightedness of U.S.
industry.
   "We don't do research until the last possible minute," he
says. "By the time we get the results, it's too late, the
technology is obsolete."
   Mr. Krueger's criticisms smack of sour grapes, but
colleagues insist he deserves a patient patron. "He needs
financial help because he doesn't fall into any neat
category," says Wallace Bowley, a professor of mechanical
engineering at the University of Connecticut. "He's in
between two giant things: art and engineering. But he moves
quite well in both worlds."
   An itinerant intellectual, Mr. Krueger is said by friends
to lack the instincts of an entrepreneur. Sometimes, he can
be his own worst enemy.
   "I describe {him} as a majority of one," says childhood
friend John Carroll, a telecommunications executive. Mr.
Carroll adds: "Somebody can have their foot on his throat,
and he'll still maintain his independence of thought. He may
do that to a fault."
   Indeed, Mr. Krueger's commercial prospects seem to be
fading. The concept of artificial reality is catching on
today, and dozens of companies, both in the U.S. and abroad,
are investigating how to put the technology to use in
everything from entertainment to medicine to product design.
But the most prominent researchers are pursuing an approach
that differs greatly from Mr. Krueger's.
   Whereas he espouses a "come as you are" philosophy, rivals
assert that it is easier to create lifelike simulations by
outfitting people with electronic gloves, data suits and
head-mounted displays. When tethered to a high-powered
computer, suitably attired people can wander in a synthesized
world that's been dubbed "cyberspace" by the faithful.
   The debate is lively. Mr. Krueger is scoring big points
with his complaint that artificial-reality hardware is too
slow. "If it isn't fast, it isn't real," he says. He also
complains that the digital wardrobe is too much of a hassle
to wear, adding: "The pressure on the technology is to make
it unencumbering."
   People are listening. "The whole point of Myron's work is
that you may go somewhere {electronically} but you don't put
gear on," says S. Joy Mountford, a researcher at Apple
Computer Inc.'s Advanced Technology Group. "I'm not terribly
excited about putting on goggles and gloves."
   Still, nearly all the money spent on research in
artificial reality is earmarked for futuristic hardware. In
the U.S., the most ambitious research is being done at the
University of North Carolina, but the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, the University of Washington and
several private concerns, most notably VPL Research Inc. of
Redwood City, Calif., also are active in the field. The
expectation is that over time, goggles broadcasting
TV-quality pictures will weigh little more than ordinary
eyeglasses. Mr. Krueger himself thinks that someday TV
screens the size of contact lenses will be laid right on a
person's eyes, piping stereo images that create the illusion
for the individual that he or she is in a motion picture.
   Some big companies are betting on such advances. Boeing
Co., for instance, is considering designing future airplanes
with the help of artificial-reality tools; these would allow,
say, pilots to roam the cockpit of a new jet before the
design itself was set. Artificial reality could transform
retailing, too. In Tokyo, a Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co. subsidiary gives customers the chance to visualize the
kitchen of their dreams by strapping on gloves and goggles --
and building their dream kitchen with their own hands, out of
modules programmed into the computer.
   "A lot of work still has to be done to find good
applications," says Robert J. Schultz, a researcher in
artificial intelligence for Matsushita in Osaka, Japan.
"Right now, {artificial reality} is an answer looking for a
question that hasn't been asked yet."
   And Mr. Krueger may be just the one to ask it. He has a
knack for cooking up fresh uses of technology, and the
courage to promote them. He's convinced, for instance, that
many buildings ought to double as electronic signs so that
their visual appearance can change frequently.
   "That's where signs are going," he says. "The whole
building will be an electronic screen. A building in Las
Vegas could look like a slot machine. This is not a gimmick,
it's a world-class image."
   Last November, a group of perfume makers called on Mr.
Krueger for advice. He told them to consider the techniques
needed to create fragrances that change with emotions. Or
what about a corporate scent? "Everyone at IBM could smell
the same way," he suggests.
   Another Krueger original: creating giant light sculptures
at airports that can be viewed only from the sky. Two months
ago, he proposed a five-mile-long light display to the
stewards of Munich's airport. They mulled it over, then said
no thanks.
   The rejection didn't faze Mr. Krueger, who considered the
snub par for the course. "Whenever a company starts talking
to me about a job, their stock goes down," he says, adding:
"My future is always in doubt."

SAUSALITO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When John Walker and some fellow computer programmers launched Autodesk Inc. in 
1982, they had a clear plan for every aspect of the business except one: the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Walker figured that with top-flight programming talent and the voracious demand 
for software spurred by the success of the International Business Machines 
personal computer, the company could just try a bunch of things and hope one 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
And one, a computer-aided design package called Autocad, not only worked, but 
also quietly became one of the most successful software products in history. 
Sausalito-based Autodesk earned a remarkable $43.6 million on sales of $175.6 
million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, and Autocad has spawned a $1-billion 
industry of software developers, equipment vendors and dealers devoted to 
making personal computers better tools for designing everything from houses to 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Autodesk faces the dicey task of proving that it's not just another 
one-trick pony in an industry that already has a string of them. And in trying 
to move beyond near-total dependence on a single product -- a goal that has 
eluded most software powerhouses, including Lotus Development, Ashton-Tate and 
Wordstar International -- Autodesk has pursued some esoteric technologies that 
most established companies won't go near. 
</P>
<P>
Although Autodesk's diversification strategy differs dramatically from the 
acquisition-oriented approach of Lotus and other firms, it must overcome the 
same basic problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Software companies get mesmerized by their market niche," says John Rossi, a 
PC software analyst at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco 
investment bank. "All their efforts are very focused, very specialized, so it's 
hard to send the whole thing down a different track." 
</P>
<P>
But if any software company is in a position to do things differently, it might 
be idiosyncratic Autodesk. Founded as a cooperative, Autodesk never accepted 
venture capital funding, and it thrives on an informal, egalitarian management 
style that's almost unheard of in American business. 
</P>
<P>
Alvar J. Green, the modest and cheerful British native who serves as chairman 
and chief executive, occupies his post because Walker and the other company 
founders prefer to focus on programming. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if I tell people what to do or anything," he declaims, sitting in 
a barren 10-by-12-foot office with a cheap wooden desk and parking lot views. 
"You have to rally people around an idea here." 
</P>
<P>
It's fitting, perhaps, that Autodesk's brand of consensus management has 
yielded an approach to new markets that is thoroughly consistent with Walker's 
original theory: try a few things and see what works. "We're looking for 
technologies that have unlimited upside potential, but where we know what the 
downside will be," Green says. 
</P>
<P>
The company even launched a new-business development unit this month and 
invited "interesting project concepts and business plans from any legitimate 
source." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Autodesk has identified a handful of such technologies. The most 
mainstream of them is multimedia computing, the integration of sound and video 
into the personal computer. Many personal computer companies expect multimedia 
to be a major growth area, and Autodesk has set up a new division to market its 
multimedia products, which so far have met with limited success. 
</P>
<P>
On the more daring side is Xanadu, conceived some 20 years ago by computer 
visionary Ted Nelson as a new way of navigating through a forest of 
information. In a Xanadu "hypertext" database, the information -- including 
text, video or any other type of data -- would be linked conceptually by the 
system, allowing the user to skip freely from one information source to another 
without using keyword searches and other traditional database methods. 
</P>
<P>
Xanadu Operating Co., based in Palo Alto, had struggled for years to get a 
product out the door, and few in the business took it seriously. But Autodesk 
did and purchased the company in 1988 for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm L. Davies, Autodesk's senior vice president for marketing, jokes that 
when Xanadu products are finally shipped -- and the goal is sometime next year 
-- the company will apply to the Guinness Book of World Records for the 
longest-running software development project in history. But if Xanadu 
succeeds, the potential market is enormous, because it will vastly simplify and 
humanize the task of finding computerized information. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly out on the edge is Autodesk's cyberspace, or artificial reality, 
project. The concept, being pursued in varying degrees of intensity by many 
large firms, is to create a completely computer-generated environment. A 
current version includes a mask with two small television screens and a set of 
electronic gloves; one can actually navigate around a seemingly 
three-dimensional room and use one's hands to pick up and move objects. 
</P>
<P>
Autodesk aims to produce a basic artificial reality operating system, and then 
software developers would use it to create "environments" for entertainment, 
physical fitness or education. Such a system could also have links to Autocad, 
allowing an architect, for example, to walk around inside a building that 
exists only as an Autocad design. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a simulation technique that complements Autocad," said project director 
Randal Walser. "We believe an industry is about to emerge." 
</P>
<P>
Autodesk has also purchased minority interests in several small software 
companies with interesting product concepts and last year acquired a competitor 
in the low-end computer-aided design business. But even with $150 million in 
cash, Autodesk is not interested in buying established firms to get into 
mainstream software markets, such as word processing or spreadsheets. That's in 
distinct contrast with other big software firms, such as Lotus, Ashton-Tate and 
Wordstar, which have tried -- and mostly failed -- to diversify by acquiring 
going businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ill-advised acquisitions, however, are hardly the only reason that most big 
personal computer software companies have only one major product. W. Frank 
King, senior vice president at Lotus, notes that dependence on a single product 
-- Lotus gets 65% to 70% of its revenue from the 1-2-3 spreadsheet package -- 
tends to be self-perpetuating. "When you have that kind of franchise, you spend 
heavily to protect it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus, he added, has at times been too focused on diversification. And with 
1-2-3 products bringing in some $500 million a year in revenue, any new 
business has to get awfully big to make a dent. 
</P>
<P>
To meet its goal of gaining only half its revenue from computer-aided design 
products within five years -- the figure is over 90% -- Autodesk will need new 
businesses that generate hundreds of millions a year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Cook, president of Intuit Software, suggests another, more disquieting 
reason that software companies tend to be dependent on one product. 
</P>
<P>
"They got lucky the first time around," he suggests. "Instead of victory 
through internal process and people doing things right, they got lucky, got 
there first and got a dominant share." 
</P>
<P>
The key ingredients to systematic success, Cook emphasizes, is being close to 
the customer and close to the market -- something it's intrinsically difficult 
to do in a new business. Autodesk has been famously successful in developing a 
dealer channel for Autocad and grasping the needs of the computer-aided design 
user, but Green admits that the company made key mistakes in pricing and 
targeting the multimedia products. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the two big software companies that have succeeded in spreading 
their wings -- Microsoft and Borland International -- are firms that made their 
initial splash with system software and programming languages, respectively, 
rather than applications software for performing particular tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hallman, chief operating officer at Microsoft, attributed some of his 
company's success in building many types of products to the fact that 
"Microsoft always took a broader view of itself, with a mission to be a 
broad-based software company," and thus didn't get trapped into 
over-specialization. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he maintains, the company is aided by the "uniting theme" of the graphics 
interface, which governs its popular Windows program -- which Microsoft 
considers an operating system -- and its applications programs, such as Word 
and Excel. But Hallman couldn't say whether operating system expertise had 
proved more "transportable" to other products than specialization in particular 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Although Autocad is an applications program, it has through the years developed 
certain resemblances to a systems product. A primary reason that Autocad has 
been so successful, in fact, is because of an "open" architecture that allows 
third parties to customize the program with specialized hardware and software. 
</P>
<P>
And Autodesk, from its early days, has also viewed itself as a broad-based 
software company, although most industry analysts consider it a computer-aided 
design company. Over the next few years it will become clear who was right.

<TEXT>
THE HACKER CRACKDOWN by Bruce Sterling Viking Pounds 16.99, 328 pages
ONE CAN appreciate the fun. You are hunched over the computer in your
bedroom, while Mom and Dad are relaxing downstairs in front of the other
kind of screen. You are hooked up to the telephone for hours, but it is not
costing a cent because the first call you make is to the phone company's
billing computer to tell it to forget the charges. Routine stuff; but then,
after hours of trying different numbers and different passwords - you hit it
big.
Pages and pages of telephone numbers and switching codes scroll down your
screen. This is no junk. The computer sending it is in the telephone command
centre. It thinks you are a supervisor and waits, like Aladdin's slave, to
do your order. So what? Well, how about this for a crazy thing? You re-route
everyone who dials the Palm Beach County Probation Department (in Delray
Beach, Florida) to Tina in New York State. She sells them pornographic
phone-sex.
Then you call up a bulletin board (a dial-up computer used as a message
centre by fellow crazies) to tell them, and particularly the Legion of Doom,
what a smart-ass you are. You sign on as Fry Guy, like usual. The other
phone phreaks, they laugh good. They say (but you disbelieve them) that they
have pulled many smarter raps. Then you go buy pizza.
Unfortunately, some people who read your message are not so completely
amused. They write it all down in spiral notebooks and then ask some even
less humorous guys: what kind of a perv would connect citizens who need the
Miami probation service to an East Coast phono-tart? And they say, maybe his
next little joke will be to call up some goddam computer and tell it to fire
a cruise missile at Wall Street . . .
So, a few months later, you are engaged in amusing converse with the Legion
in your bedroom when all the house doors are burst open by men with guns.
'You Fry Guy?', they say. 'Place your hands on your head and move real slow
away from that machine.' Mom and Dad say this is unbelievable.
But it happened. Fry Guy, a 16-year-old schoolboy who also admitted
infiltrating the MacDonald's payroll computer to give two of his friends a
raise, was convicted on May 31 1990, and put on probation.
The case thoroughly alarmed the US federal authorities. It showed that a
teenager with the simplest computer and a phone line could penetrate the
innermost fastnesses of the telecommunications network and re-program the
computers that control it. What mischief could he then do] Calls diverted or
monitored, accounts changed at will, telephone numbers deleted, altered or
created out of thin air; all this and more was within the grasp of the
hackers - and that 'more' was the ability to wipe out the whole telephone
system, including emergency services, for hours - possibly days.
Bruce Sterling has done a good job in describing the authorities' crackdown
since then on a group of hackers with sinister names, such as Legion of
Doom, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist, whose fun, it seemed, was becoming far
beyond a joke.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the US authorities had been more tolerant
of computer pranksters. One reason was that they refused to believe that the
network of thousands of academic, defence and company computers linked by
global telecommunications could be penetrated seriously by outsiders.
Intrusions were difficult to detect, and any that were discovered seemed to
do relatively little damage. Even when hackers were using telephone lines
without paying, the 'theft' of time from the network seemed rather abstract.
However, by the mid-1980s, as home computers became more sophisticated, some
spectacular break-ins were occuring. By far the best account is in Clifford
Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg, which explains how a German hacker hijacked the
international telecommunications system and broke into high security
computers all over the US, including one at the Pentagon.
Sterling tells the story of a concerted counter-move by the authorities. In
Operation Sundevil, during three days in May 1990, 40 computers were seized
with some 23,000 floppy disks containing, stolen passwords and credit card
numbers, programmes and logs of information exchanged by hackers over the
network.
Sterling, unlike Stoll, shows some sympathy for the more 'responsible'
hackers (ie those doing it as an intellectual game rather than with criminal
intent), but he acknowledges that the line is difficult, if not impossible,
to draw. He also explores libertarian issues, such as the damage caused by
the security services to innocent computer users.
This is an interesting but uneven book, in which fascinating facts are
sometimes padded out with generalisations and a bit too much discussion of
issues. A newcomer to the field should start with Stoll's superb 'whodunnit'
of cyberspace. Sterling is better than adequate in explaining what happened
next.

   Lotus to Acquire Novell for $1.5 Billion;
   Possible Challenge to Microsoft Is Seen

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. is making a
bold play for software industry leadership with its surprise
agreement to acquire Novell Inc., of Provo, Utah, for $1.5
billion in stock.
   The action solves Lotus's biggest long-term problem --
being a one-product company. Since Novell has more than half
the market for network software, the combined company is
likely to play a big technological role as other software
companies design their programs to work in the networks of
personal computers that are spreading through offices. And if
their marketing arms can sell each other's products, they
will get the attention of many customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said that if the two companies successfully merge
their strengths and offset their weaknesses, they may provide
a counterweight to the industry dominance of Microsoft Inc.,
Redmond, Wash., which competes with both Lotus and Novell.
   "The merger rearranges the power structure of the software
industry," said Aaron Goldberg, a market researcher with
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. Combined, the two
companies' sales are expected to top $1.2 billion this year;
analysts expect Microsoft to have $1.1 billion in revenue in
its fiscal year ending June 30.
   Lotus agreed to acquire Novell for 41.6 million shares of
stock with a market value of about $1.5 billion. It would be
the third-biggest computer industry merger ever after
Burroughs Corp.'s merger with Sperry Corp. to form Unisys
Inc. and General Motors Corp.'s $2.5 billion acquisition of
Electronic Data Systems Inc.
   Lotus was once the industry leader because of the success
of its best-selling 1-2-3 spreadsheet. But its failure to
come up with other hits has enabled Microsoft, which has come
out with a slew of popular products, to surpass it.
   Timothy McCollum, a software analyst with Dean Witter,
said, "This is a very good growth area for Lotus to get
into."
   Networking personal computers together is a booming
business because personal computers are becoming powerful
enough to do the jobs of minicomputers and even mainframes in
corporate and government offices.
   However, Mr. McCollum cautioned that merging the two
companies may prove difficult. John McCarthy, an analyst with
Forrester Research, Cambridge, Mass., predicted corporate
culture shock when the "MBA yuppies from Lotus go out to
Provo."
   Both companies have been sharp stock gainers in the past
month as technology stocks came into favor. But on Friday,
investors -- worried that the merger may prove difficult, and
disappointed that Novell holders won't get a premium --
showed their displeasure. In over-the-counter trading, Lotus
stock fell $2 to $34.25. Novell stock fell $4.125 to $38.75.
   The two companies described the combination as a merger of
equals. Lotus will exchange stock equal to the average value
of Novell stock in the past 10 days. It said it will swap
1.19131 Lotus shares for each Novell share. After the merger,
Novell holders will own about 48% of the combined company.
   Lotus's Jim P. Manzi will remain chairman, president and
chief executive officer of the combined company. Raymond
Noorda, Novell's chairman, will become vice chairman and
chief executive of the Novell subsidiary.
   One factor that helped make the agreement possible was
that Mr. Noorda is 66 years old, and doesn't have a clear
successor. Mr. Noorda said he doesn't have any plans to
retire, but acknowledged that the lack of a second in command
"leads to some insecurity among investors."
   Both companies are highly profitable, fast-growing
software concerns. Last year Lotus reported net income of $68
million, or $1.61 a share, on sales of $556 million. Sales
had been hampered last year until Lotus finally started
shipping updated versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet during the
summer. This year most analysts expect strong growth.
   Novell reported net income of $48.5 million, or $1.46 a
share, on revenue of $421.9 million for its fiscal year ended
Oct. 28. Novell has about 52% of the market for software that
lets networks of personal computers share printers,
information and programs.
   If the merger works as planned, the two companies will
complement each other. "Our view is this is a powerful
combination. Sales and marketing are very complementary,"
said Mr. Manzi. Lotus expects to sell its network software,
including a new program called Notes, through the resellers
who handle Novell networks. Novell expects Lotus's
salespeople, who deal with big corporations, will help it get
its Netware into more offices.
   In terms of technology, Mr. Manzi said Lotus is making its
applications easy to use in networks where users share
information, rather than only in individual PCs. With Lotus's
backing for Novell, other software vendors may design their
programs to work well with Novell's Netware rather than
emphasizing Microsoft's competing LAN Manager.
   The combined companies may resemble the structure of
Microsoft, analysts said. Microsoft sells both software
applications, such as its Excel spreadsheet, and operating
systems that control the inner workings of computers and
networks. Now Lotus will sell applications software such as
its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and operating systems for networks.

FT  12 APR 94 / Technology: Costly resistance to telecommuting - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advances in technology make it easier for many companies to convert some of
their office staff into telecommuters. They thereby gain a competitive
advantage through lower operating costs and more productive staff.
But while technology such as compact desktop computers, E-mail and fax
machines makes fitting telecommuters into the office network relatively easy
 -and cheap video conferencing systems are just around the corner -
management attitudes are still stuck in the past.
Jack Nilles, president of California-based management consultants Jalla
International and the person who coined the term telecommuter more than 20
years ago, says many managers do not know how to supervise staff unless they
can see them.
In telecommuting (or teleworking) employees come into the office one or two
days a week and spend the rest of their time working from home. For
companies, there are clear advantages. Supervision of staff is reduced and
savings can be made on overheads such as office space and parking space.
Happier staff means lower turnover and thus savings from reduced recruitment
and training costs. And teleworkers tend to work harder and longer hours
when at home. For staff working mainly from home, the benefits are obvious:
more productive time with less commuting; lower travelling costs; and
control over their own working time.
Companies that can learn to manage teleworkers are thus likely to achieve
greater flexibility in their operations. But teleworking should not be seen
as simply a more progressive way of working. Moving workers into the home
also means transferring the responsibilities of maintaining an office space
and certain management functions to the teleworker. Once teleworkers are
established, they are just one step nearer the status of independent
contractors.
By employing such contractors, companies transfer even more responsibilities
to the teleworker - tax payments and, more importantly in the US, individual
responsibility for health benefits, a major business cost. Companies also
gain greater flexibility in hiring and firing as many teleworking contracts
are limited to single projects. Already in the US, temporary workers and
independent contractors are the fastest-growing sector of the labour market.
While this growth is mostly in the blue-collar sector, telecommuting
technologies are now helping to turn many white-collar and professional
workers into independent contractors. Book publishers are an example of this
trend. Many now contract out most of their requirements such as editing,
book layout and design to a host of independent contractors.
As the US and Europe lay the foundations for electronic information
superhighways, many other companies in different sectors will be able to
convert staff roles into independent contractors. Initially, such
contractors will be able to earn higher incomes than their office-bound
colleagues tied to one employer. But the technology enabling them to work
from idyllic countryside locations will result in competition among
contractors - and from locations around the world.
In the US, there are several incentives for companies to increase their
teleworkers. The recent earthquake in southern California and the damage to
its motorways has led to a rise in teleworking in an area that already had a
high proportion to begin with.
The US Clean Air Act specifies that companies with more than 100 staff in 11
US states with high air pollution must seek ways of reducing employee car
use or face stiff fines. Many companies complain about the increased burden
of complying with such regulations. But those that view this as an
opportunity to employ more telecommuters will learn valuable lessons on how
to manage a mixed workforce. Rival European companies should keep a close
eye on what this does to US productivity.

AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications company, has
formed an alliance with Novell, the leading supplier of computer networking
software, to develop and market products linking computer networks with
telephones.
Products resulting from the joint efforts will 'bring the power of
computer-telephone integration to desktop comp-uters,' the companies said
yesterday.
They aim to help businesses increase office productivity by integrating
existing telephone and computer networks to provide 'telephony services'.
Merged computer-telephone networks will eventually be accessible from all
types of desktop computers, the companies added.
The first product, called a 'telephony server NetWare loadable module', will
link Novell's popular NetWare computer networks with AT&amp;T's Definity
communications systems.
It will allow customers to use common telephone features, such as
auto-dialling, conference calling and message management, in combination
with information stored in their computer networks.
Users will be able to speed-dial numbers and take notes on their computers.
Notes from previous conversations will be available with each new call.
The companies also plan to develop products that integrate services such as
electronic mail, facsimile and voice mail.
Mr Ray Noorda, Novell president and chief executive, said: 'Telephony
services are a powerful combination of technologies which will benefit
customers by providing integration between their existing voice and data
networks.
'The technology will simplify management and pave the way for delivery of
many new services.'
Mr Jerre Stead, president of AT&amp;T Global Business Communications Systems,
said: 'The market for computer-telephone integration is expected to almost
double each year during the next five years as customers discover its
productivity benefits. We intend to be leaders in this emerging market.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (1): One stop that does it all
 -The growth of applications running on 'client-server' networks amounts to
a second computer revolution. Low-cost hardware and sophisticated software
have opened the way, while calls for greater business productivity are the
spur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is being described as the second computer revolution, the most profound
shift in the pattern of use of information technology since the advent of
mainframe systems in the 1950s.
Computers and telecommunications are merging to allow the creation of IT
networks that are narrow enough to serve a single department in a
corporation or as broad as a global enterprise. The key development is the
growth of applications running on 'client-server' networks, workstations and
larger computers linked together to process data co-operatively. This has
been made possible by improved local and wide-area communications and
cheaper processing power and memory on small computers.
Among the moves that suppliers are making which indicate that the networking
revolution is fully under way are:
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software house, this year
launched Windows NT, its next generation operating system. Windows NT, a
large and complex piece of software, is the first Microsoft operating system
designed for enterprise-wide computing. It competes not only with
International Business Machines' OS/2 personal computer operating system,
but also with MVS, IBM's flagship mainframe operating system.
Novell, the local area network (Lan) software supplier, acquired Unix
Systems Laboratories last year and forged an alliance with the database
vendor Oracle this year, in moves to consolidate the position of both
companies and fight the challenge from Windows NT.
Most significant of all, IBM, the stumbling giant of the computer industry,
established a client-server business unit, a startling change of direction
for a company whose business success has been based on centralised
mainframes.
There are equally significant moves on the telecommunications side of the
fence. The world's large carriers are increasingly concerned to offer their
large customers 'one stop' shopping in voice and data communications. The
range of activity is broad. AT&amp;T of the US, for example, is involved in the
development of 'personal digital assistants'. These inexpensive, hand-held
devices combine the functions of a telephone, computer, facsimile machine
and electronic organiser.
The scene is thus being set for a business environment where corporate
information is readily available to executives either in the office or on
the move.
Wireless communications is enjoying a new vogue. According to CSC Index, a
leading US IT consultancy, 'wireless communications is a technology in which
global players are making multi-billion dollar investments and forming
cross-industry alliances'. It says that cellular radio carriers in the US
alone have made more than Dollars 10bn in capital investments since 1984.
The business logic derives from the 'Negroponte Switch', the observation by
Prof Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media Laboratory that communications to
people on the move should shift to wireless means, leaving television and
other transmissions to fixed targets to cables in the ground.
Olivetti of Italy has already announced a system for connecting personal
computers using radio frequencies rather than cables.
It is clear, therefore, that the scope of networking has changed over the
past decade. In earlier days the emphasis would have been on linking
mainframes and on standards contests such as the battle between IBM's
Systems Network Architecture and the world standards organisations' Open
Systems Interconnect.
Today the emphasis is on effectiveness; what makes the revolution possible
is a combination of low-cost computer hardware and sophisticated software;
what makes it necessary is a universal demand for greater business
productivity and competitiveness.
An example is Equipment et Composants pour L'Industrie Automobile (ECIA),
which is majority owned by Peugeot of France. It has established a
pan-European network of 10 sites running the IBM mid-range AS/400 system.
The network runs on IBM's SNA rules and is driven by an IBM mainframe based
at Audincourt near Paris. It is part of a ECIA project called 'Parler le
Meme Langage (Pamela)' which is being built to ensure that all parts of the
group work in the same way with standardised information and with objectives
and results which can be compared on the same basis. The key element is a
package called Data 3, manufacturing resources planning software written by
Hoskyns, the UK arm of Cap Gemini Sogeti of France.
Mr William McGilvray, supply manager at ECIA subsidiary HPC of Coventry,
explains: 'Under the old system, top management could not have looked at the
1992 devaluation of sterling and said: 'Let's put more work into the UK
because costs are lower there'. Now comparisons of this kind can be made
quickly and objectively.' Other motor manufacturers are installing similar
aids to productivity.
Why has computer networking assumed this new significance? The starting
point is today's business environment. Customers are demanding better and
more flexible service. They expect shorter lead times, improved quality and
responsiveness. IT networking, through electronic data interchange (EDI),
computer aided engineering (CAE) or group working can provide the means of
fast and flexible response.
The computer industry has been quick to coin expressions to describe the
essential features of the revolution: 'downsizing' - moving applications
from mainframe systems to less expensive but no less powerful microprocessor
based computers; 'client-server computing' - processing data on networks of
computers, some of which provide computing or data services to the network,
the rest serving as workstations; 'co-operative computing' where the network
functions as a single processing unit.
Among the companies which are helping to shape the new communications worlds
are, at the personal computer level, network operating system supplier
Novell, the market leader with NetWare version 4.0, Microsoft and Banyan. At
the local area network level, fast-growing hardware companies Cisco and 3Com
as well as Ungermann-Bass provide the essential hubs and routers for network
interconnection while suppliers of wide area networks include the
telecommunications companies AT&amp;T and BT. At the systems level computer
hardware and software vendors include IBM, Digital Equipment,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Bull.
The aim of networking is simple: to enable computer users to have access to
information, applications software and computing resources without needing
to know where any of these are located. But there are dangers, not least of
which is the comparative novelty of the technology.
Prof Stephen Bradley of Harvard Business School sounded a powerful warning
recently: 'Competitors may invest first without fully understanding the
strategic implications or evaluating the financial impact of their
investment, and other firms may copy these investments lest they be left
behind in a rapidly changing industry', he wrote, arguing that many
companies were investing heavily in IT networking in the forlorn hope of
gaining significant advantages. 'Most firms', he concluded, 'do not realise
a competitive advantage from their investments and those that do find it
difficult to sustain.'
It is a damning judgment, but it echoes the concerns that managers have
frequently expressed over the difficulty of justifying investment in IT. The
answer, according to Prof Bradley, is to assess spending on IT and
telecommunications as part of a coherent business strategy; to view it as a
strategic necessity rather than an attempt to gain sustainable competitive
advantage.
Putting networks together is, in practice, hard work and the larger the
network, the more complex the problems. To judge from the enthusiasm with
which networks are being installed, the rewards seem worth the risk.
According to Mr Peter Wright, European director of Dell Computer's
integrated systems division, the number of personal computer local area
networks (PC Lans) grew by 33 per cent last year to 780,000. He says the
principal aim is not to save money through downsizing, but to gain greater
efficiencies in all parts of the business. In short, it is the essential
underpinning for business process re-engineering, today's shorthand for
rethinking a business from the bottom up.
With the growth of networking, the problems of network management have
expanded. It is now the single greatest concern of IT managers in larger
companies. The London consultancy Ovum forecasts that the market for
management frameworks will be worth nearly Dollars 900m in the US and Europe
by 1998.
Today, the concern is to manage a broad range of communications and
computing devices from a variety of suppliers distributed over many sites.
The more aware organisations are already looking beyond that to ways of
managing business applications - software that supports practical business
processes - across a diversity of networking technologies.

<LEADPARA>  Ever since its founding in 1983, the marketing effort of Banyan Systems Inc.
was virtually inaudible. The software maker quietly provided large,
sophisticated customers with the products to link vast networks of personal
computers.;   Now Banyan is turning up the volume to seize market share from
Novell Inc., its much-better-known rival.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BANYAN TAKES A LOUDER TACK TO WREST BUSINESS FROM
NOVELL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Twice as many vendors will now distribute Banyan's products, as the company
lays plans for going public next year and increases its visibility with a full
frontal attack on Novell. "Things They Don't Tell You at Novell
Presentations," a brassy new Banyan brochure announces.;   "They've
established a strong marketing presence for the first time in their history,"
said Robert Gill of the Gartner Group, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
"They are now getting in the door to pitch their story.";   Banyan, based in
this suburb west of Boston, has only 7.5 percent of the $1.2 billion market
for network software. That is dwarfed by Novell, based in Provo, Utah, which,
by serving much smaller computer networks, has captured about 60 percent of
the market. Novell has annual sales of $700 million and the loyalty of the
nation's largest computer companies.;   Some industry consultants, like George
Colony of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., believe Novell is simply too
strong a competitor for Banyan or any other seller of network software.;  
"Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Digital have all thrown their hats in with Novell's
Netware," Colony said, explaining that these companies have agreed to sell
Netware -- Novell's network software -- with their own products. "The game is
over.";   Others say that Banyan's technology has been too far ahead of its
time, and now that the world is ready for its products, it faces in Novell a
much more powerful marketer.;   David C. Mahoney, Banyan's president and chief
executive and one of its founders, remains undaunted. He delivers his sales
pitch with the vigor of an evangelist. Rather than compete directly with
Novell, he decided to concentrate on linking larger computer networks.;   "We
had a vision and didn't want to deviate from it," he said.;   Stressing
Banyan's 25 percent annual growth rate and 20 straight profitable quarters, he
noted that Banyan had successfully left the computer hardware business, which
just last year accounted for 50 percent of sales, to focus on the more
profitable sale of software.;   Mahoney expects Banyan to increase its sales
from $100 million to $500 million in just five years. Banyan, he said, has
staked out a critical niche, with the technical strengths to emerge as a
major, long-term competitor.;   One of Mahoney's most pressing tasks is
gaining credibility with many more corporate customers. To do that, Banyan,
which is privately held, will probably go public early in 1992.;   Mahoney
said that the company did not need the cash but that corporate customers
tended to be wary of private companies, and financial analysts ignored Banyan
while touting its competitors.;   Mahoney, 46, He founded Banyan with two
associates in 1983 -- one is now the technology chief, the other departed to
start his own software company. They named the company for a tropical tree
that drops vines that then grow their own roots.;   Banyan's problem today is
not Novell but Banyan itself, Mahoney said: It simply has not gotten its
message out. His solution was to bring in a new marketing chief last year,
James D'Arezzo, the former vice president of international marketing at Compaq
Computer Corp.;   The Marine Corps used Banyan's Vines software in the Persian
Gulf war to link 350 personal computers throughout the region -- transmitting
almost immediately the equivalent of 300 pages of orders that until recently
took hours to deliver electronically.;   Banyan's Vines system allows users to
find and communicate with each other in seconds -- a technically sophisticated
feature that Novell's Netware lacks.;   "If you use Novell's Netware with 500
users, it is very difficult to find the user you are looking for," said Frank
Michnoff, a consultant with the Meta Group in Westport, Conn. "Are you going
to scroll through 500 names? Not likely.";   Industry consultants say that
Banyan has 12 to 18 months before Novell comes out with its own improved
features for locating other users on a network.;   And Banyan boasts of its
coming counterattack: software that will allow many key features of Vines to
run on systems linked by Novell's Netware.  </TEXT>
