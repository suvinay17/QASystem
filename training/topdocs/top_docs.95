FT  04 JUN 94 / Lion eyes its share: A bumper crop of films at the US box
office
</HEADLINE>

June is shaping up as a more than usually magical month for Walt Disney. The
US entertainment giant got off to a nice start this week when a Saudi
Arabian prince swept to the rescue of Euro Disney, its financially troubled
French theme park associate.
Desert themes were already much on the mind of Mr Michael Eisner, Walt
Disney's chairman: the company has just released a low-budget sequel to its
hit animated movie 'Aladdin' directly into the US video market - bypassing
cinemas - and this follow-up, called the 'Return of Jafar', is proving a big
hit.
It is the first time Disney has made a full-length film purely for the video
market, a sector dominated by cheap children's fare and exercise tapes with
inspiring titles like 'Buns of Steel'.
The gamble is paying off. Across the US, children under the age of 10 are
pestering parents for a copy, and industry experts suggest 'Jafar' could
become one of the 10 best-selling videos of all time.
But Disney's biggest June success has yet to come: in the middle of the
month it will release its latest full-length animated movie, 'The Lion
King', the story of a young lion that becomes king of the jungle after
fighting off a wicked uncle who kills his father. In other words, Bambi
crossed with Hamlet in an exotic African setting.
It has superb animation, music by British pop star Elton John, and a strong
cast of actors' voices, which includes Jeremy Irons, Rowan Atkinson and
Whoopi Goldberg. No wonder Hollywood is confidently predicting it will be
the runaway hit film of the summer.
That would be no small achievement, because the summer season is one of
Hollywood's most important periods of the year, accounting for some 40 per
cent of the annual American box office take.
But this year the season - which began with last weekend's Memorial Day
public holiday and ends with Labor Day in early September - is producing
much more than the normal quotient of hysterical Hollywood nail-biting.
There are two reasons. First, spring was unusually bad at the box office,
with so few American-made hits that a low-budget British comedy, 'Four
Weddings and a Funeral', briefly became the most popular movie in the
country.
Second, the studios are releasing an extraordinary number of films this
summer - about 60 - and they cannot all be hits. Films that do not perform
well over the weekend they are released, or during the subsequent weekend,
will be quickly and cold-bloodedly yanked from cinema schedules.
Hollywood will be hard-pressed to match the success of last summer, when
'Jurassic Park', the dinosaurs-run-amuck movie directed by Steven Spielberg
and backed by Universal Studios, broke all box office records and powered
the industry to an unprecedented Dollars 2.1bn in ticket sales. This paved
the way for a record annual Dollars 5.1bn at the US box office.
But at least half a dozen films could break through the Dollars 100m barrier
for total US box office sales which traditionally marks a film as a
blockbuster - and they will need to if the studios are to make a decent
profit, since some of the most ambitious movies cost Dollars 40m to Dollars
50m to make.
'True Lies', a spy adventure from Rupert Murdoch's Fox group, starring
muscle-man Arnold Schwarzenegger, is rumoured to have cost more than Dollars
100m. Schwarzenegger, reunited with the director who made his big hit
'Terminator 2', will be trying to put behind him one of last summer's
biggest flops, 'Last Action Hero'.
The season has got off to a strong start. 'The Flintstones', produced by
Spielberg and distributed by Universal, took a record Dollars 37.5m at the
box office over the Memorial Day weekend. That just topped the Dollars
37.03m taken in 1989 by 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'. The film has
real actors playing characters from the 1950s cartoon series of the same
name, with its Stone Age setting and signature cry of 'Yabba Dabba Doo'. The
movie has been widely panned. Critics' barbed puns range from 'Yabba Dabba
Don't', to 'Yabba Dabba Doo-Doo'.
But it seems certain to maintain its strong run ('have legs', in the
industry jargon), thanks to a huge tie-in marketing campaign, involving
1,000 products ranging from McDonald's hamburgers to Flintstone catapults.
The success of the 'Flintstones' has overshadowed the strong start made by
Warner Brothers' 'Maverick'. Starring heart-throb Mel Gibson, this is
another in a long line of movies this year which revamp television series.
The trend has critics wondering about the paucity of Hollywood's
imagination.
Others with hit potential include 'City Slickers 2', a follow-up to the
success that comedian Billy Crystal had with the first modern-day western
with this title; 'Forrest Gump', the story of a simpleton starring Tom
Hanks; and 'Speed', about a bus rigged by a psychotic to explode if it slows
below 50mph.
But the season should still belong to 'The Lion King', which industry
observers think could top Dollars 200m in total US box office receipts. With
that and the Saudi rescue under his belt, Mr Eisner might be heard muttering
'Hakuna Matata', the Swahili motto adopted in the film by the would-be lion
king. It means 'no worries'.

<TEXT>
FORREST GUMP (12) Robert Zemeckis
THE LION KING (U) Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff
MINA TANNENBAUM (12) Martine Dugowson
FUNNY MAN (18) Simon Sprackling
Early in Forrest Gump, before its hero has grown into Tom Hanks, he is
chased down a country road by school bullies. The braces on his legs - the
boy is ill-developed physically as well as mentally - suddenly fly apart and
free him to run like a sprinter.
For Forrest Gump read Forrest Gump. This 2 1/2 -hour comedy/fable/history
lesson must once have seemed the most handicapped project on the Hollywood
lot: an epic hobble across post-war America with a holy fool for hero and a
road paved, or potholed, with 40 years of national good intentions and
national seizures (Dallas, Vietnam, Watergate). Our Forrest grows up into an
Alabama Candide: a man around whom great events happen but who remains
blithely unscathed and unimpressed by them all.
Would such a movie play in Peoria? Even the original novel by Winston Groom
only sold 30,000 copies in hardback.
Commercially it has run like the wind: Dollars 270m at the US box office to
date - it may topple Jurassic Park as the highest-earning film in history -
and an entire nation besotted with Gump wit and wisdom. Like its
innocent-messianic hero, who becomes an athlete and spends much of the movie
jogging across the land as a torchbearer-without-torch for the human spirit,
Forrest Gump the film has thrown aside its leg-braces and left footprints
all over Clinton-era America.
Indeed Gump may be Bill Clinton, we (and others) opine. One of several
ingenious trick-optical scenes has the backwoods boy shaking hands with JFK
himself. And surely that was a favourite scene from the Clinton movie
scrapbook too.
But like the man in the White House Forrest Gump spends a deal of time
trying to be all things to all folk. Self-ingratiatingly, and for this
viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical
with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy. When Forrest
overnights at the Watergate Hotel in the early 1970s, after a chat with
Nixon (more state-of-the-art opticals), we chortle approvingly as he becomes
the first man to blow the whistle on the 'plumbers'.
But only minutes before that we are watching him in Vietnam behaving like
John Wayne in The Green Berets. As he runs back and forth through a
napalm-blazing jungle, finally saving unit leader Gary Sinise, a nightmare
war is turned into an arch cameo of Boy's Own heroism. Sinise will adorn the
rest of the movie as a double amputee, providing a support paradigm -
Gloucester to Forrest's Lear - of grace under pressure in millennial
America.
But is it grace or just glamourised gormlessness? 'Stupid is as stupid does'
is one wisdom intoned by Hanks's dogged Southerner - his face puckered in
sage earnestness, his vowels a lugubrious, elastic twang - as he proves that
an IQ of 75 does not disqualify you as the moral hero of a nation.
Accident is destiny, destiny accident: that is the other saw that keeps
buzzing. From the opening credits sequence, in which a feather drifts from
the sky down to Forrest's shoe as he sits on a park bench hijacking
strangers with his life story (a blend of EL Wisty and the Ancient Mariner),
director Robert 'Roger Rabbit' Zemeckis and screenwriter Eric Roth pile on
the haphazard while steering Forrest unerringly towards fulfilment. He gets
to love a woman (Robin Wright), an ex-flower child whom he saves from the
hell of 1960s liberalism. He fathers his own child. He grows rich from the
shrimping business.
He is, we begin to realise, America herself: that dear, untutored land that
redeems itself by its innocence even when it creates tragedy by its
ignorance. This rose-tinted mirror held up to the USA by the USA says, 'If
we have never truly grown up - never do grow up - nothing can truly be our
fault.' If sentimentality were a crime, Forrest Gump would be put away for
life. As it is, it will probably be with us for life: the ultimate feel-good
film in an age when no one any longer has the courage to feel bad.
Moviegoing in late-summer America has been a dangerous activity. Turn away
from the idiot savant on the park bench and you will walk straight into the
jaws of The Lion King (Dollars 250m and climbing).
But this option is more fun. Disney's new animation feature is its first
ever based on an original screenplay and has a real freshness of setting and
vision. The African wilderness shimmers across the wide screen - do not wait
for the video - as the orphaned lion prince Simba grows up to dethrone his
wicked uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) who had his regal father run over
in a wildebeest stampede.
We are all run over by this wildebeest stampede. From where I sat it started
in the north-west speaker, surged down the side aisle, roared over the
Empire screen towards Leicester Square, then rumbled out in the south-west
speaker. Spectacle matches sound: thousands of dust-raising shapes shaking
the desert as the camerawork soars and curvettes overhead.
The sequence lasts 2 1/2 minutes and took two years to create. Jeremy
Irons's voice for Scar probably took two hours and is just as splendid: a
wicked George Sanders purr sliding up and down the scale of sarcasm like a
cat on a polished bannister.
The film loses its magic towards the end, with a gaudy, hurried showdown. We
miss the burnished charm with which the film sauntered round its early
scenes. Here - and in the middle section where a hip meerkat and doleful
wart-hog keep Simba company in the paradise valley of his exile - The Lion
King matches the comical and painterly bravura of the great Disney cartoons.
Is there such a thing a feel-bad film today? Mina Tannenbaum ought to
qualify, but by some proprietary charm formula fails to do so.
Mina (Romane Bohringer) is a plain, introverted Jewish girl, tormented by
not having her best friend Ethel's vibrant social graces. Ethel (Elsa
Zylberstein), also Jewish, is tormented because she does not have painter
Mina's depth and artistic talent.
Stir in two passive-aggressive Jewish mothers - adding gall to a stew
steeped in wormwood - and you have this drama of interconnecting female
lives, bubbling and spitting across two caustically observed decades.
Screenwriter Veronique Heuchenne and director Martine Dugowson make
sardonically merry with the fashions of the 1970s: floor-sweeping trouser
bottoms and hats like floppy stovepipes. Then they make menacing with the
greedy 1980s, when ambition and love rivalry pulls the girlfriends apart.
We could cry 'Woman's picture' and complain that emotion swamps action and
that the men are pawns in a parable of sisterhood. But after the runaway
patriarchalism of Forrest Gump and The Lion King - where woman's sole
function is to be mettle-polisher to the dominant male - Mina Tannenbaum is
a welcome reminder that half the planet has its own mind and will and hand
on destiny's tiller.
Funny Man, a British horror comedy from first-time writer-director Simon
Sprackling, is the week's booby prize. If you ever win a round of poker from
Christopher Lee, make sure you do not accept his forfeit of an ancestral
home. It contains a homicidal 'joker' (Tim James, putty-faced up to resemble
a Jimmy Savile from hell) whose delight is picturesquely to murder you and
your friends.
Sliced heads; pierced eyeballs; electrocution; burning. All the fun of the
auto-da-fe. And between murders the film returns to its normal idling state:
a benighted, terminal catatonia. Wait for the video. And then keep waiting.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Silver screen glows gold: A team of entertainment mogulsis
challenging the big film studios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barely a day had gone by in the seven weeks since Jeffrey Katzenberg handed
in his resignation as head of Walt Disney's movie studios without the
Hollywood gossips lining him up with yet another new partner or venture.
This week, the guessing was over. Mr Katzenberg announced that he was
teaming up with his two closest friends: Steven Spielberg, the highly
successful film maker, and David Geffen, the billionaire rock music mogul,
to create a 'dream team' entertainment group.
Their aim is to challenge the leading movie studios that have dominated
Hollywood for decades, such as Disney, which in its last audited accounts
made total revenue of Dollars 2.2bn. The critical question is whether wealth
and talent will be enough to enable them to fulfil their ambitions in the
cut-throat entertainment industry.
'These guys have got great timing,' said Tim Wallace, entertainment industry
analyst at SG Warburg Securities in New York. 'There's huge growth potential
in the industry and no shortage of new investors. But this is a complex and
costly business. They've got lots of talent but enormous egos.'
The three men are dazzlingly wealthy. Katzenberg, 43, is fresh from the
success of The Lion King, Disney's latest animated hit. He is a millionaire
after cashing in his Disney share options.
His partners are two of the wealthiest people in the US. Spielberg, 47,
directed four of the 10 most commercially successful films ever, including
ET and Jurassic Park. Geffen, 51, has become a billionaire by investing the
Dollars 700m he made by selling his Geffen Records stake in MCA to Japan's
Matsushita.
So far, they have been short on detail about their venture. All that has
been said is that they will be equal partners in the company, which will
launch early next year with Dollars 250m of their own capital. Geffen Films
will be merged into the new business, as will Mr Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment. The venture will develop its own projects in animation,
movies, television, music and interactive entertainment.
The decision to create a fully fledged studio flies in the face of current
industry trends. A studio is a huge enterprise with big buildings, a large
staff and highly sophisticated technology.
No one knows exactly how much it will cost the dream team to launch their
studio. However, industry estimates suggest that if they hope to establish
the company as a force in animation, for example, they will need to make a
total investment of up to Dollars 500m over five years in order to release
at least three films of the same quality as The Lion King.
Most new arrivals in Hollywood have balked at such an expensive and lengthy
investment. Some have bought existing studios as Mr Rupert Murdoch did with
20th Century Fox, Sony with Columbia and Matsushita with MCA/Universal.
Mr Murdoch has made a success of Fox. But Sony is still struggling to
restore Columbia's fortunes, while Matsushita is embroiled in an acrimonious
row with the MCA management over the latter's desire to buy back the
business.
Other recent investors have invented 'virtual' studios by making films in
rented facilities and by making piecemeal investments in independent
producers. Ted Turner, the CNN magnate, adopted this approach in making the
recent cult comedy, The Mask. So did PolyGram, the London-based music group,
with Four Weddings and a Funeral.
However, life in the independent sector can be perilous, as illustrated this
week by Carolco, the independent US producer. It is now struggling for
survival after its proposed merger with the Live Entertainment retail group
collapsed this week.
The risks of launching a studio are even greater. But so are the potential
rewards, particularly in animation, where the studio can count on an
impressionable market of children - and their parents - to boost sales of
video, books, toys and other merchandise associated with film. Disney took
Dollars 267m at the box office in the first four months after launching The
Lion King in the US, but that has been surpassed by the income from
merchandising.
'An animated hit like The Lion King can make a fortune,' said Richard
Grand-Jean, president of Global Film Equity, the New York-based film finance
specialists. 'But Thumbelina, which didn't do well at the box office, made
money from video. And no one is better at animation than Jeffrey
Katzenberg.'
Katzenberg and his partners have chosen a good time to launch their venture.
The traditional movie business is buoyant. Box office takings in the US have
reached Dollars 3.94bn so far this year, according to Variety magazine,
against Dollars 3.82bn and Dollars 3.43bn in the same periods of 1993 and
1992 respectively.
The international box office is even healthier, thanks to the emergence of
new markets in eastern Europe and Asia, most recently in China, where Time
Warner has just signed a distribution deal with the authorities.
The merchandising market is also showing strong growth, as illustrated by
The Lion King's success. Meanwhile, new technology offers exciting
opportunities in movie-making and interactive entertainment for the studios
to explore in the future.
Spielberg is a technology fiend, and was at the forefront of experiments in
digital technology with his special effects for Jurassic Park. He sees the
new studio as an ideal vehicle for his future experiments. The next wave of
technological developments should take the studios into new forms of
distribution, such as CD-Roms for use in the home and more sophisticated
cinemas that replicate movie special effects, such as the physical
experience of being in a car chase, for the audience.
The convergence of the entertainment industry with new technology has
attracted a stream of investors to Hollywood. The misadventures of Sony and
Matsushita have done little to dampen the enthusiasm of the other
electronics, information technology and telecommunications companies, such
as ITT and IBM, that are searching for partners in the entertainment
business.
The new venture will offer an appealing package for investors. Microsoft,
the world's largest software house, has already been mooted as a potential
partner for their studio. There is also speculation of an alliance with the
MCA management if it succeeds in buying the company back from Matsushita.
'The movie business is full of swamps: just look at the problems Sony and
Matsushita have had in Hollywood,' says Oscar Moore, editor of Screen
International, the film industry magazine. 'But Katzenberg and Geffen are
very talented men, and Spielberg has made more money for the film industry
than anyone else in its history. A lot of people will be willing to bet on
them.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Films lift Disney to record: Downturn in theme parks more
than offset by 43% rise in film sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The success of Walt Disney's animated features, especially The Lion King,
more than offset a downturn in theme parks to produce record fourth-quarter
earnings of Dollars 226m, against a loss of Dollars 78m. Group operating
profits, before losses in Euro Disney, were up 23 per cent at Dollars 439m.
For the first time in more than a decade, films made more profit in the full
year than theme parks (excluding Euro Disney), at Dollars 856m versus
Dollars 684m.
According to Disney, The Lion King is now established as its most successful
feature ever, and is on track to be one of the five most successful films in
history. In the final quarter, operating income from films almost doubled to
Dollars 189m on sales up 43 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn.
The executive most credited with this result, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, made a
highly public departure from Disney at the end of the financial year. His
job as chairman of Walt Disney Studios has been divided among other Disney
executives.
Operating profits from theme parks (excluding Euro Disney) fell 18 per cent
to Dollars 155m on sales 2 per cent higher. International tourist traffic
fell, the company said, and costs had been written off for the proposed
Civil War theme park in Virginia, which Disney was forced to abandon.
The company said yesterday it was still contemplating a new theme park in
Florida, but had yet to decide whether to go ahead or what the theme might
be.
Profits from the consumer division, covering the merchandise of characters
and books from the films, rose 33 per cent to Dollars 95m on sales up 36 per
cent at Dollars 490m. This was also due chiefly to the success of The Lion
King, Disney said.
For the year as a whole, operating profits from films rose 38 per cent on
sales up 30 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. Disney said the year had also been
helped by the animated features Aladdin and The Return of Jafar, as well as
by strong video sales of older features such as The Jungle Book and Bambi.
The share of losses in Euro Disney fell to Dollars 58m, from Dollars 415m,
for the quarter and Dollars 110m (Dollars 515m) for the year. Earnings per
share for the quarter were 42 cents, against a loss of 15 cents, and for the
full year were Dollars 2.04, against 55 cents.
Full-year net income was Dollars 1.1bn compared with Dollars 300m.
Disney spent Dollars 920m on repurchasing 23m of its shares since May, with
Dollars 512m of that coming in the final quarter. The board has now
authorised the repurchase of a further 90m shares, on top of the 14m still
authorised under the existing programme. At yesterday's closing price of
Dollars 43, this could cost the company about Dollars 4.3bn.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Media Futures: When you wish upon a keyboard - A high-tech
film challenge to Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wired, the super-hip technology magazine, regularly carries a recruitment
advertisement from Walt Disney, the entertainment group, bearing the slogan:
'If you're good with a mouse, we've got great people, cool hardware and big
challenges in advanced computer graphics'.
It seems very likely that future issues of Wired could carry a similar
advertisement from Disney's latest competitor - the new entertainment group
being launched by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of
Disney's movie studios, Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film director,
and David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul.
The new group, like Disney itself, will be anxious to attract the cream of
the new breed of technology buffs if it is to achieve its ambition of
becoming a force in feature films and animation.
The impact of new technology on the entertainment industry not only played a
pivotal part in persuading the three partners to set up a new studio, but
will be critical in determining its development.
Steven Spielberg has made no secret of the fact that he sees the new company
as a vehicle for his experiments with movie-making technology. The
extraordinarily realistic dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, his Dollars 356m
blockbuster, were digital creations from the computers of Industrial Light
and Magic (ILM), the special effects laboratory set up in San Francisco by
George Lucas, director of Star Wars.
Digital technology enables film-makers to shoot scenes which would otherwise
be too expensive - or logistically impossible - to film.
Jurassic Park proved how appealing such techo-trickery could be. Digital
effects also feature in some of this year's box-office hits, including
Forrest Gump, which creates the illusion of Tom Hanks participating in
famous historical events, and True Lies, the Arnold Schwarzenegger action
film whose director, James Cameron, has teamed up with IBM to create his own
Digital Domain special effects lab in Los Angeles.
Spielberg is intent on further developing the creative potential of digital
effects at the new studio. Similarly, technology is an essential element of
Jeffrey Katzenberg's plans to create a new animation company.
Animation is one of the most lucrative areas of movie-making (largely
because of the high sales potential for videos and other merchandise).
But the expense of recruiting large teams of skilled artisans has
traditionally deterred newcomers from challenging Disney's dominance of the
animation field.
The quality of animated films has been transformed by the computer-generated
techniques that Jeffrey Katzenberg encouraged his animators to use at
Disney, as illustrated by the success of The Lion King, one of the most
elaborate animated films ever, which took Dollars 267m in four months at the
US box office.
These new techniques have also reduced the need for skilled craftsmen,
thereby paving the way for the new company (as well as Warner, one of the
major studios) to move into animation.
Finally, the technological revolution in movie-making has drawn new
investors into the entertainment industry from related fields that include
electronics, information technology and telecommunications. As a result,
there should be no shortage of industrial partners for the new studio to tap

Hollywood rumour-mongers have already started to round up likely suspects.
Microsoft, the software giant, is at the top of the list.

FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Animated films edge Disney ahead

The continued runaway success of Walt Disney's new and classic animated
films helped the US entertainment group shrug off lower theme park
attendances to post a slight improvement in third-quarter profits, to
Dollars 267.5m, or 49 cents a share.
In the same period a year ago, the group earned Dollars 259.1m, or 48 cents.
The results, which came in above Wall Street analysts' forecasts, were
welcome news for the company, whose fortunes have suffered recently from the
death in April of Mr Frank Wells, president, and the sudden incapacitation
of Mr Michael Eisner, the chairman, who underwent quadruple heart bypass
surgery 10 days ago.
These events raised a question over the depth of management at Disney, and
revealed differences within the group over who should succeed Mr Eisner when
he retires.
Yesterday's announcement of third-quarter results, however, helped reassure
shareholders that in spite of Disney's travails, its earnings continue to
grow.
Revenues in the period climbed 22 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn, thanks to
record revenues from the film and consumer products divisions, both of which
were buoyed by the success of Disney's animated films.
Film revenues jumped 53 per cent to Dollars 1bn, powered by the box-office
hit The Lion King, an animation feature which was released in June and sold
Dollars 186m in tickets during its first six weeks. Heavy demand in the US
home video market for The Return of Jafar, a sequel to the top-selling
Aladdin animated film, also contributed greatly to revenue growth.
The popularity of Disney's new animated films, and classics such as Jungle
Book and Bambi, helped boost earnings at the group's consumer products
division, where revenues rose 38 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 407.6m.
Sales of The Lion King merchandise and records were especially strong.
The one disappointment in the quarter was the performance of Disney's theme
parks and resorts division, which reported a 4 per cent decline in revenues
to Dollars 942.2m.
The group blamed the decline in park attendance on a fall in the number of
foreign tourists, and on the continued impact on its California attractions
of January's Los Angeles earthquake.
The other negative influence on Disney's quarterly earnings was
EuroDisneyLand, the struggling French theme park 49 per cent-owned by the US
group. Disney said it took a charge of Dollars 52.8m in the third quarter to
cover the cost of its contribution to an emergency financial restructuring
of the Euro Disney group.
Disney's shares closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 42 1/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday.

There is an old movie adage that when all else fails - or when all else has
succeeded but you need a fresh gimmick - you should send your characters
into the desert.
There you will find eye-catching scenery, limitless horizons and a licence
to conjure mirages. Many people at Cannes this year thought The Adventures
Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert was a mirage. A comedy of cross-dressing
from macho Australia? And a funny one?
It fast became the hit of the festival. It revives Terence Stamp's career at
a stroke - he plays one of three drag queens whose hired bus breaks down in
the Outback, causing many an unexpected encounter and adventure - and
provides the wittiest, most off-the-wall gay movie since La Cage Aux Folles.
Priscilla opens this Friday. Disney's The Lion King opened last Friday and
is already swallowing large audiences whole. This desert is African and the
most spectacular cartoon landscape of modern times. Thrill to the stampeding
wildebeest. Gasp at the burning plains patrolled by lions and hyenas. And
relish Jeremy Irons' suave turn as the wicked lion uncle, obviously reared
on old George Sanders films when he was a cub.
Zhang Yimou's To Live, from the director of Red Sorghum and Ju Dou, is
another of China's revisionist epics about Chinese history: 30 years in the
war-ravaged, Mao-harrassed
life of a puppeteer and his
wife. But Zhang's vision is fiercer and harsher than Chen Kaige's
in the recent Farewell My Concubine, and the battle confrontations in the
desert are unforgettable.
Finally, wrap up your desert research with Walter Hill's Geronimo, filmed in
scenic Utah, a few leagues north of the Indian chief's real stomping grounds
in Arizona/New Mexico. In other respects the movie, opening this week,
claims exhaustive historical authenticity and has Gene Hackman and Robert
Duvall in the supporting cast.

Hollywood brings its big guns to Britain this week. Forrest Gump and The
Lion King are the box-office phenomena of the year.
They have made Pounds  1/2 bn in America, and are still collecting.
Gump, a time-hopping fable starring Tom Hanks, offers 2 1/2 hours of
mind-boggling special effects: see our hero chat and shake hands with
President Kennedy in glorious trick news-footage] In turn, Lion reawakens
the Disney wildlife menagerie years after the studio first struck gold with
The Jungle Book.
Either of these family-appeal fantasies could end up giving Jurassic Park
(now on video) a run for its millions as the highest-grossing film ever, so
are we all entering second childhood?
Probably: since the third US hit now picking UK pockets - and for me the
best of them all - is Speed. It has Keanu Reeves, a bomb, a runaway bus and
the most ingeniously-wired suspense plot in years. For children, as the
publicists used to say, of all ages.
But then cinema is the place where we all go to lose years from our mental
ages.
When A Man Loves A Woman is one success story of the summer for grown-ups.
The powerful tale of a marriage wrecked by alcoholism is still showing in
movie houses across Britain. Go and see it, if only to decide how much money
to put on Meg Ryan for next year's best actress Oscar.
At London's National Film Theatre, no Oscars and no nine-figure revenues for
individual movies.
Instead: the annual Jewish Film Festival, opening with acclaimed French film
Mina Tannenbaum, and several programmes doing what the NFT does best:
guarding our audio-visual culture.
Look out for a 25th anniversary season of Monty Python memorabilia starting
this week: much of the now-classic material once thought lost from the TV
archives.
For VCR viewers, it is time to lay in stocks for the long evenings to come.
Tom Hanks is in Oscar-winning pre-Gump form in the video-released
Philadelphia, as a prejudice-battling Aids sufferer. Hearts Of Darkness is
an hypnotic feature-length documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now
(better than the movie, pace Mr Coppola).
And the newly-restored Gone With The Wind is a snip at Pounds 15. It works
out at 1p a minute if you end up - and why should you not? - watching it six
times.

The success of Walt Disney's animated features, especially The Lion King,
more than offset a downturn in its theme parks to produce record earnings of
Dollars 226m in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 78m last
time.
Group operating profits, before losses at Euro Disney, the theme park near
Paris, were up 23 per cent at Dollars 439m.
For the first time in more than a decade, films made more profit in the full
year than theme parks (excluding Euro Disney), at Dollars 856m compared with
Dollars 684m.
In the final quarter, operating income from films almost doubled to Dollars
189m, on sales up 43 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn.
Operating profits from theme parks (excluding Euro Disney) were down 18 per
cent for the quarter at Dollars 155m on sales 2 per cent higher.
International tourist traffic was lower, the company said, and costs had
been written off for the proposed Civil War theme park in Virginia, which
Disney abandoned in the face of widespread opposition.
Profits from the consumer division, covering the merchandise of characters
and books from the films, were up 33 per cent at Dollars 95m on sales up 36
per cent at Dollars 490m. This was also due chiefly to the success of The
Lion King, Disney said.
The share of losses in Euro Disney fell to Dollars 58m, compared with
Dollars 415m for the quarter and Dollars 110m, down from Dollars 515m, for
the year.
Earnings per share for the quarter were 42 cents against a loss of 15 cents,
and for the full year, Dollars 2.04 compared with 55 cents. Full-year net
income was Dollars 1.11bn, up from Dollars 300m.
Disney spent Dollars 920m on repurchasing 23m of its shares since May, with
Dollars 512m of that coming in the final quarter. The board has authorised
the repurchase of a further 90m shares, on top of the 14m still authorised
under the existing programme.
At yesterday's closing share price of Dollars 43, this would cost the
company about Dollars 4.4bn.

FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dark clouds obscure Disney's
star - A difficult year could get even tougher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year is rapidly shaping up to be Walt Disney's 'annus horribilus'. In
the past eight months, the US entertainment group has endured a string of
setbacks.
They have included:
the loss of the company's highly-regarded president, Mr Frank Wells, in a
helicopter accident in April;
the temporary incapacitation, following emergency heart bypass surgery, of
its chairman, Mr Michael Eisner;
a politically embarrassing tussle with historians over plans to build a new
Disney theme park near Civil War battlefields in Virginia;
another costly financial reorganisation of Euro Disney and declining
attendance at its US theme parks;
and a series of disappointing performances from its live-action (as opposed
to animated) movies.
While the group has scored some successes at the box office, most notably
the triumph of its animated film The Lion King, a cloud appears to have
followed Disney around all year.
Last week, the company suffered another serious blow when Mr Jeffrey
Katzenberg, the widely-respected film executive who helped turn Disney's
moribund movie division into the most profitable studio in Hollywood,
announced he would be leaving the company when his contract expires at the
end of September.
Mr Katzenberg is departing because Mr Eisner would not give him Mr Wells'
old job as president. Although Mr Katzenberg had hankered after a bigger
management role at Disney, and had his sights on succeeding his long-time
mentor as chairman, Mr Eisner did not feel the studio chief had the right
credentials to be the number two.
Although Disney moved quickly to offset the impact of the loss - appointing
a new studio chief from within and unveiling a restructuring of the film
entertainment division - nagging questions remain.
Can Mr Eisner, who relied so heavily upon the late Mr Wells' support and
counsel, run Disney single-handed? Who, if anyone, is best-placed to succeed
Mr Eisner as chairman? And will Disney's hugely profitable animated films
unit prove as successful without Mr Katzenberg at the helm?
Disney has been quick to rebuff suggestions that Mr Eisner needs help
running the company. An experienced lawyer and negotiator, the 62-year old
Mr Wells played a crucial management role at the company, overseeing
Disney's day-to-day operations as well as helping to build its longer-term
strategies. Yet Mr Eisner, who described Mr Wells as 'the glue that held the
place together', has chosen not to replace him.
Instead, the Disney chairman has taken on the additional post of president,
and passed on many of the administrative duties to Mr Sanford Litvack, head
of the company's legal and human resources departments, and now its chief of
operations.
Mr Wells' deal-making skills, however, are likely to be missed, especially
as Disney faces some tough decisions, such as how to position itself on the
information superhighway, and whether to move aggressively into the
broadcast television business by acquiring a US network.
If Mr Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president raised only a few
eyebrows in the first few months after Mr Wells' death, it is now being
questioned widely following Mr Eisner's heart problems. Although his doctors
say he will make a full recovery, speculation about the succession issue
will not die down, and is likely to intensify now that Mr Katzenberg is
leaving.
The company, however, is sticking to its line that Disney's management team
is deep enough to provide Mr Eisner with all the support he requires.
Mr Raymond Watson, a Disney board member and former chairman of the company,
says there is no need to anoint a successor to Mr Eisner just yet. 'You
don't decide who is going to replace a 52-year old CEO when that person's
contract has another five years to go.'
Mr Watson also insists Mr Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president
should not be second-guessed. 'Who is the right person, or persons, who can
do the kind of things that Frank Wells did? That's a call Michael Eisner has
to make.
'This has a lot to do with the situation with Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jeffrey
Katzenberg was an outstanding executive in his field. But the question was:
would he be as effective in a role that is essentially complementary to
Michael Eisner? Michael decided he wouldn't. And I agreed with him on that.'
Another who agrees with that decision is Mr Christopher Dixon, an
entertainment industry analyst with the Wall Street firm PaineWebber. He
believes the restructuring of Disney's film entertainment division announced
last week will make Mr Eisner's job easier.
The restructuring involved splitting the film entertainment division in two.
Disney's highly-successful television business and its nascent
telecommunications operations will now be run as a separate unit by Mr
Richard Frank, who had been head of television at Disney's studio arm.
The remainder - the motion pictures production and distribution business -
will be run by Mr Joe Roth, formerly head of Disney's Caravan Pictures
offshoot, whose chief task will be to revitalise the lacklustre live-action
films unit.
These changes, say Mr Dixon, are part of a process of turning Disney into a
more decentralised company. Its individual businesses - theme parks, films,
television, music, merchandising, and now telecommunications - have grown so
fast it now makes sense to split them up, and to have each run by their own
specialist managements.
These are changes that other large, diversified entertainment groups, such
as Time Warner and Viacom, have gone through, says Mr Dixon. For Disney, the
PaineWebber analyst says, 'the restructuring goes a long way to helping push
management down into the divisions.'
While the changes in the film division should give Mr Eisner more time to
concentrate on Disney's longer-term strategies, he will have to keep a close
eye on the company's most profitable unit - the animated film operation -
when Mr Katzenberg leaves.
Although the outgoing studio chief earned much of the credit for reviving
the animated films business, company insiders now say Mr Roy Disney, the
founder's nephew, played as crucial a role as anyone in producing
blockbusters like Aladdin and The Lion King. Analysts believe that with Mr
Disney at the helm of animation, Disney's long run of successes should
continue.
Breathing new life into the theme parks, sustaining the success of the
animation films and reviving the live-action pictures, plotting Disney's
course on the information-superhighway: these are some of the biggest tasks
now facing Mr Eisner and his top lieutenants.
If 1994 has been a difficult year so far, the next 12 months could prove
even tougher.

Tonight promises to be the night that Steven Spielberg, financially the most
successful director in film industry history, receives the artistic
recognition that Hollywood has long denied him.
Spielberg, the director of the hit films ET and Jurassic Park, is the strong
favourite to win the best-director award at that annual rite of prize-giving
and mutual admiration, the Oscar ceremony. The awards are voted on by the
4,755 leading members of the US film industry who belong to the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The award would be for Schindler's List, a black-and-white film about the
Nazi holocaust against the Jews of Europe, which has been nominated for 12
Oscars and has won critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of the
subject.
His film's main challenger in many of the Oscar categories could be The
Piano, a highly original art-house film by the New Zealand director Jane
Campion, which deals with 19th century eroticism in the antipodes. Its star,
the American Holly Hunter, is widely tipped for the best actress award.
A fistful of awards would be a big boost for the studio which backed
Schindler's List - Universal, part of the MCA group bought by Japan's
Matsushita electronics group. Universal has had a mixed box office record in
recent years, though it had a huge hit last year with Spielberg's dinosaur
movie, Jurassic Park.
Matsushita is said to be seeking other outside investors in MCA. Its
Japanese rival, Sony, has acknowledged that it is considering bringing in
new investor to its Columbia studios, which also have a mixed record.
Oscar rewards for The Piano would be a fillip to Walt Disney, which agreed
last May to buy the film's distributor, a small independent, Miramax.
After the mutual back-slapping of Oscar night, Hollywood's financial brains
will return to focus on the film industry's next big hurdle - its release
programme for the important summer season in America.
Analysts are forecasting a summer of record US box office returns, thanks to
a group of potentially strong selling films, including a new animated
feature from Disney called the Lion King.
None of them, however, is likely to match the success of Jurassic Park last
summer.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Ex-Disney head joins Spielberg in new entertainment group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the most powerful figures in Hollywood - Mr David Geffen, the
billionaire music mogul, Mr Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film
director, and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of Walt
Disney's movie studio - are joining forces in a new entertainment company.
The company, which will open early next year, aims to compete directly with
the leading studios - including Disney - by producing movies, animated
films, television programmes, music and interactive entertainment.
The three founders will own equal shares of the venture and will provide the
initial funding. However, there was speculation among industry observers
that they might soon seek external finance.
Mr Tim Wallace, entertainment industry analyst at SG Warburg Securities in
New York, said: 'What will be really interesting is whether they team up
with any of the telecommunications and computer companies that now want to
buy into Hollywood.'
The news ends weeks of speculation about Mr Katzenberg's future since he
left Disney in August. Mr Katzenberg, 43, played a pivotal part in Disney's
success since the late 1980s, culminating in the release of The Lion King,
its latest animated hit which has already grossed Dollars 270m in the US
alone.
Mr Katzenberg, once dubbed the 'golden retriever' for his flair for flushing
out talent, quit after being passed over for the presidency. His new
partners are two of his closest, and wealthiest, friends.
Mr Geffen, 51, made his first million by the age of 25 and has since become
a billionaire by investing the Dollars 710m he made in 1990 from selling his
record company's share of the MCA entertainment group to Japan's Matsushita.
His Geffen Films subsidiary will become part of the new venture, as will
Amblin Entertainment, Mr Spielberg's production company. Mr Spielberg, 47,
will continue to direct for other companies but is expected to use the group
as an outlet for his fascination with technology.

   Anything's possible in Oz, and just about
everything's possible in Hollywood.
   Like Dorothy as a blonde.
   When shooting first began on ``The Wizard of Oz,'' director
Richard Thorpe put Judy Garland in a blond wig. He was later fired
and replaced by Victor Fleming (``Gone With the Wind'') and King
Vidor. Garland ditched the golden locks and played the movie in her
own hair and a fall.
   ``The Wizard of Oz,'' like most movies, abounds with anecdotes
and tales both tall and true.
   There's the story of the ragged coat Frank Morgan wore as
Professor Marvel. It was purportedly purchased from a second-hand
store in Los Angeles and, as the story goes, Morgan pulled out a
pocket one day and found the name L. Frank Baum sewn inside. Baum
wrote the orginal Oz stories.
   Or, when Dorothy first meets the Lion and slaps him for growling
at the Tin Man and Scarecrow, and the lion grabs his tail and
cries. Garland burst into giggles on the set and delayed the shoot.
Fleming, as the legend goes, took Garland behind one of the trees
and slapped her. The scene was shot and the take was good.
   Later, the director called the three vaudeville stars ``hams''
for dancing down the Yellow Brick Road without little Judy.
   And the vaudeville in Bert Lahr allowed him to come up with the
classic movie line, ``unusual weather we're having, ain't it?,''
when Dorothy and friends wake up in the poppy field during a
snowstorm.
   Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow, later said, ``We joked a
lot because that was the only way we could survive.''
   Every film has someone who's responsible for ``continuity.'' In
``Oz,'' that meant that every morning someone would count the straw
sticking out of Bolger's costume to make sure it was accurate in
terms of what had already been shot.
   Costumes and makeup took their toll on Bolger, Margaret Hamilton
(the Wicked Witch), Bert Lahr (the Lion) and Jack Haley (the Tin
Woodman). Bolger's skin began to wrinkle because of the Scarecrow
makeup and mask, Haley's 40-pound costume prevented him from
sitting between takes, Hamilton had a green tint to her skin even
when the movie was completed and her fake fingernails were always
popping off.
   Because the movie used more lights and electricity than any
other movie _ it was shot in Technicolor _ the set was unreasonably
hot. Sometimes, it would even smoke up. Lahr, whose costume was
extremely heavy and snug, was drenched in perspiration after
minutes.
   While stories about the ``The Wizard of Oz'' continue to
delight, the movie has grown from a childhood romp to the campy
comebacks of a jaded generation. Memo and note pads abound with
Dorothy's wide-eyed proclamation to Toto once they've landed in Oz:
``I don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Toto.''
   And the Wicked Witch of the West's admonition to Dorothy,
``Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too,'' after
Dorothy says that dropping a house on the Wicked Witch of the East
was an accident, is now a popular one-liner.
   But most of all, ``The Wizard of Oz'' will always evoke happy
thoughts of home. As Dorothy said, ``If I ever go looking for my
heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own back
yard because, if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin
with.''

Walt Disney said that Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg is to step down as chairman of
its film entertainment unit, Walt Disney Pictures, when his contract expires
at the end of next month.
The group also announced that the film unit is to be restructured. It will
be split into two separate entities: one for television and
telecommunications, which will be run by Mr Richard Frank, currently
president of Disney Studios, and one for movie production and distribution,
to be run by Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the group's Caravan Pictures
affiliate.
The departure of the 43-year old Mr Katzenberg is a blow to Disney.
Under his tenure, Disney has been one of the most successful studios in
Hollywood. This year, the animated film The Lion King was a huge
international hit and is poised to become one of the most successful films
of all time.
Mr Katzenberg's decision to leave Disney is believed to be related to the
failure of Mr Michael Eisner, the group's chairman, to appoint a successor
to Mr Frank Wells, the former Disney president who was killed in a
helicopter accident in April.
Mr Katzenberg's achievements in his nearly 10 years as head of Disney's
studios had appeared to make the 43-year old executive a natural heir to Mr
Wells' position.
When Mr Eisner declined to appoint a new president, it was widely seen as a
rejection of Mr Katzenberg as a potential future Disney chairman.

Walt Disney said yesterday that Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg is to step down as
chairman of its film entertainment unit, Walt Disney Pictures, when his
contract expires at the end of next month.
The group also announced that the film unit is to be restructured. It will
be split into two separate entities: one for television and
telecommunications, which will be run by Mr Richard Frank, currently
president of Disney Studios, and one for movie production and distribution,
to be run by Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the group's Caravan Pictures
affiliate.
The departure of the 43-year old Mr Katzenberg is a blow to Disney.
Under his tenure, Disney has been one of the most successful studios in
Hollywood. This year, the animated film The Lion King was a huge hit in the
US and internationally, and is poised to become one of the most successful
films of all time.
Mr Katzenberg's decision to leave Disney is believed to be related to the
failure of Mr Michael Eisner, the group's chairman, to appoint a successor
to Mr Frank Wells, the former Disney president who was killed in a
helicopter accident in April.
Mr Katzenberg's achievements in his nearly 10 years as head of Disney's
studios had appeared to make the 43-year old executive a natural heir to Mr
Wells' position.
When Mr Eisner declined to appoint a new president, it was widely seen as a
rejection of Mr Katzenberg as a potential future Disney chairman.
At the time, Mr Katzenberg was reported to have told friends that he would
leave the group if he was not made president.
The question of management succession at Disney has been a talking point in
Hollywood since Mr Wells' death. It became even more urgent last month when
Mr Eisner underwent emergency heart bypass surgery.
Although doctors predicted a full recovery for Mr Eisner at the time, his
illness, and the lack of a number two at Disney, cast a cloud over the
group's long-term prospects.

<TEXT>
Walt Disney's motion pictures group has named Mr Chris McGurk as president,
effective immediately, writes our financial staff.
The company said that Mr McGurk would be responsible for the group's
business activities, as well as international theatrical distribution, film
acquisitions, Miramax films, Hollywood Records, Disney Theatrical
Productions and character voices and dubbing.
Mr McGurk was previously vice president and chief financial officer of the
studios. The company said the promotion was part of a restructuring of the
filmed entertainment division.
The studio's management has been in flux since Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg's
bitter departure as studio chief in August. Mr Katzenberg played a pivotal
part in Disney's success since the late 1980s, culminating in its latest
international hit, the animated film The Lion King, which is poised to
become one of the most successful films of all time.
Earlier this week it was announced that Mr Katzenberg is to join Mr David
Geffen, the billionaire music mogul, and Mr Steven Spielberg, the film
director, in a new entertainment company.

   HOLLYWOOD -- The movie industry thinks it has the perfect
antidote for its recessionary woes: actors who won't demand a
"percent of the gross" but are always animated.
   Literally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by the success of "The Little Mermaid" and the
re-released "101 Dalmatians" from Walt Disney Co., nearly all
the major studios are rushing out full-length animated
features. In an age of spiraling costs, animated movies
rarely require the outlays of live-action films. There aren't
any big star egos to soothe or hefty star salaries to pay.
The demographics promise a large return when the films are
released on home video. And there's big potential in licensed
merchandise and theme park tie-ins.
   But the glut of entries won't make marketing the films
easy. The battle will be joined Nov. 22 with the head-to-head
release of Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" and a Universal
Pictures sequel, "An American Tail: Fievel Goes West."
   Other animated films headed for the starting gate include
"FernGully . . . The Last Rainforest" from News Corp.'s
Twentieth Century Fox. Samuel Goldwyn Co. will release
"Rock-a-Doodle," a movie by Don Bluth, creator of "The Land
Before Time." Turner Entertainment, the Turner Broadcasting
System unit that just bought Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.,
is working on "Tom &amp; Jerry: The Movie." And next summer
Paramount Pictures, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.,
will release an animated film aimed at urban youngsters
called "Bebe's Kids."
   Until recently, Disney had the animated field to itself,
re-releasing its classics every few years and throwing in an
occasional new film. But as Disney geared up so that it could
release one new animated film a year, the competition woke
up.
   Now, the studios are vying with each other to find release
dates when the competition will be minimal. That isn't easy,
though. Many film executives believe animated features play
well only in a few narrow periods when families can go to the
movies together. Fox originally planned to release
"FernGully," its first animated feature since 1983, this
month. But it didn't want to slug it out with the other two
pre-Thanksgiving openings so it moved its picture to next
Easter.
   Another major problem facing all of the studios except
Disney is that their films usually don't have characters
children recognize. Nor do they have the Disney "seal of
approval" that tells parents a film is probably good, clean
and safe even for young children.
   To make up for that, the studios are working overtime to
reach potential audiences with advance details about their
new stories and characters. Marketing and publicity
executives at Fox have begun their campaign to raise
awareness for "FernGully" six months before its release. They
recently sent out elaborate press kits, added a trailer for
the film to the studio's "Home Alone" video and started
exploring direct-mail options.
   Goldwyn's "Rock-a-Doodle" won't open until next April, but
the company arranged for a "Rock-a-Doodle" float in this
year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, including a two-minute
production number in front of the store. Beginning next year,
Scholastic will insert "Rock-a-Doodle" posters and study
guides into teachers' magazines, reaching six million kids.
Goldwyn is also linking up with International Dairy Queen
Inc. and Quaker Oats Co.'s Life cereal.
   Disney and Universal have also been priming the publicity
pump for months, even though "Beauty" is based on a famous
fairy tale and "Fievel Goes West" is a sequel featuring a
fairly well-known character. Disney has formed promotional
ties with Burger King Corp. and Colgate Palmolive Co.;
Universal, a unit of Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co., is linked to PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut and RJR Nabisco's
Nabisco Biscuit Co.
   This will be the third time that the two studios have
opened animated features on the same day, a strategy that
runs contrary to the usual Hollywood approach. In 1988,
Disney's "Oliver &amp; Co." took in $53.1 million, beating
Universal's "The Land Before Time" at $48.1 million. In 1986,
the original "An American Tail" won with $47.5 million;
Disney's re-release of "Song of the South" took in $17.7
million.
   Many industry watchers expect Universal's mouse to beat
Disney's beast in their opening weekend. That's because
Universal's movie will be released on about 1,400 screens.
Disney is holding its film to 900 screens, adding 400 to 600
more on Christmas Day.
   Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment is developing the
Fievel films into a powerful franchise. The immigrant mouse
is at the center of a merchandising and licensing program,
and the studio is promoting the movie at its theme parks.
   Disney is pitching "Beauty" as an "event." It took the
unusual step of previewing a "work-in-progress" copy of the
film in late September at the prestigious New York Film
Festival, making it the first ever animated movie to be shown
at the event.
   Disney recently showed the same version to an audience of
Motion Picture Academy of America members in Hollywood.
Programs distributed at the screening featured a letter from
Disney Vice Chairman Roy Disney and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
chairman of Walt Disney Studios, telling Academy members of
the success of the New York screening.
   "Animation is indeed a unique and collaborative process. .
. . Yet no animated film has ever received an Academy Award
for Best Picture," the letter said. "We hope you'll leave
tonight's screening with a new or renewed appreciation for
this very special art form."

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: All animated about fairy tales - Tim Burt discusses
Disney's plans to reinvigorate the cinema cartoon / Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENAISSANCE started with a rabbit called Roger. Although a little slow
and rather clumsy, Roger has reinvigorated the world's appetite for an art
form that 10 years ago was said to be facing extinction - the cinema
cartoon.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, released by Touchstone in 1988, won critical
acclaim and a couple of Oscars; more importantly, it grossed Dollars 154m
and persuaded Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, there was money in
feature-length animated films.
Disney, concerned at the losses on its theme park investment in Europe, has
decided to increase production of its profitable feature films. In the past,
movies were released at a rate of one every three years; that gap narrowed
last year with Aladdin, Disney's latest offering, following the success in
1991 of Beauty and the Beast. The company now to plans to produce two
feature-length animated films a year and is banking on European expertise to
help draw them.
The US company regards Europe, and London in particular, as a centre for
excellence in modern animation. So the skills which first gained
international recognition with the antics of Roger Rabbit are now being
actively pursued by the most famous studios of them all.
A senior executive from Walt Disney this week arrived in London to recruit
artists for a new generation of animated films. Unlike classics such as Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs, these productions will not be years but months
in the making. Max Howard, vice president of Walt Disney Animation in
Florida, thinks European animators are the ones to make it happen.
Walt Disney, he says, is keen to produce more animated features because,
against all the expectations of the early 1980s, they are proving wildly
popular. Attracted by the new dimensions of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? - the
first widely-distributed feature to use computer technology - cinema
audiences have flocked to see Beauty and the Beast, which grossed Dollars
147m in the US and Pounds 94m in the UK.
In Aladdin, due to be released in the UK later this year, one of the
characters is entirely computer driven. A magic carpet - hand drawn and then
committed to a computer's memory - moves around the screen in a way few
artists could emulate. It turns and twist in three dimensions, offering the
directors camera angles which where previously only available to live film
features.
Howard, who ran the Walt Disney studio in London where Roger Rabbit was
made, believes computers now allow an audience to enter the world of the
cartoon characters. That faith has paid off handsomely. Aladdin has grossed
more than Dollars 212m in the US and Walt Disney expects that figure to
double after its international release.
Audience demand for such special effects has been a major catalyst for
Disney, which intends to employ some of Britain's best animators on future
production such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas, both
scheduled for release in 1995. There has also been a lucrative spin-off for
other UK talent including lyricist Tim Rice, who is currently working on The
Lion King, Disney's animated African tale, along with actor Jeremy Irons and
rock star Elton John.
At the company's studios in Glendale and Orlando, however, the contribution
of these famous names pales against that of James Baxter, a London art
school graduate recruited by Disney after working on Roger Rabbit. Baxter
went on to create Belle, the feisty heroine of Beauty and the Beast.
The US group's willingness to import overseas talent, however, masks a
growing frustration in the UK that there are no backers willing to
underwrite a home-produce animation feature. Richard Williams, the creator
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, has failed to complete his long-awaited Thief
and The Cobbler and has returned disillusioned to his native Canada.
Only on television, where Channel Four and SC4 in Wales have invested
heavily in animation, is there a growing market. But even so, many
independent producers feel acclaimed outside the UK and ignored at home.
David Sproxton, co-director of Aardman Animation in Bristol, which last year
won an Oscar for best animated short film, says, 'The fact that Disney can
come here reflects that we do not have resources. We have skills and ideas
but not finance.' He fears that overseas studios are snapping up UK
animators because there is not enough work at home. Without substantial
financial backing, he predicts most animation studios will go on doing what
they do best - making TV commercials.
At Disney, Max Howard admits that funding has been the main brake on UK
animation but suggests that the industry may also have been hindered by the
stories it decided to bring to the screen. Walt Disney is not taking that
kind of risk. It plans to serve up more favourite dishes - fairy tales and
fables. Howard says the productions coming across the Atlantic now contain
fewer spoonfuls of sugar than in the past, but Disney is determined to pour
in enough syrup to keep hold of its biggest audience, the young teenagers.
'Great quality animation won't make a film a success,' he says. 'Look at
Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast. There has been a renaissance, but it's
still about finding the right stories to tell.'

<HEAD>MGM-Pathe Deal Closes, Finally</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp.'s $1.36
billion buyout of MGM-UA is finally a done deal, but whether the
historic studio and its trademark lion will roar again remains
uncertain.
   The new enterprise, like the pending purchase of MCA Inc. by
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., seeks to exploit an
international hunger for Hollywood entertainment. Pathe's holdings
are mainly European.
   But unlike robust Sony Corp., which last year bought Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, Giancarlo Parretti's cash-poor Pathe
labored for months to close the MGM-UA deal.
   Bringing success to the new studio will be a struggle, analysts
say.
   Wall Street experts have said it will take at least $500 million
and several years to revive MGM-UA, whose recent releases range
from hits such as ``Rain Man,'' to box office bombs such as
``Desperate Hours.''
   Pathe has mortgaged its future, said Jessica Reif, an analyst
for First Boston Corp. The new studio's budget and its profits,
Reif said, will be tied up in the sale of foreign, domestic and
home video rights to nearly every movie in the combined
Pathe-MGM-UA libraries for the next 10 years.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, an executive for a rival
studio said the newly formed MGM-Pathe Communications Co. will need
hit movies fast. He estimated the price paid may have been double
the studio's worth.
   Pathe officials say they paid a fair price and intend to
recapture the once-legendary status of MGM.
   Parretti spokeswoman Arlene Cattani said the Italian financier
took possession of the studio and its Leo the Lion trademark at
11:07 a.m. PST.
   A beaming Parretti later was greeted in his offices with a
surprise from his staff - a real lion named Sudan - to personify
the deal's closing. He gingerly sidled up to the 450-pound brute
for a few quick photographs.
   ``Our goal is to make the MGM lion roar again,'' Parretti said
in a statement. ``We will continue to develop the kind of product
that has made the MGM and UA names legendary for generations, while
building on Pathe's global presence.''
   The buyout pays stockholders of MGM-UA a total of $21.50 per
share. Earlier payments of $4 a share were made this summer.
   Craig Parsons, a spokesman for Pathe, said Parretti would become
chief executive officer. He and his longtime associate, Florio
Fiorini, will be named co-chairmen.
   Pathe Entertainment's Alan Ladd Jr., part of a host of film
executives who headed MGM-UA, will run the new studio, Parsons
said.
   Beverly Hills-based Pathe produces television and feature films.
It also has a variety of European movie-related holdings.
   As part of the complicated transaction, MGM-UA will buy Pathe's
assets for $700 million, raised in part through the sale of rights
to a variety of Pathe, MGM and United Artists film and television
properties. That $700 million will then be used to help buy MGM-UA.
   Independently, Pathe raised $600 million through stock sales to
unidentified European investors.
   Those entities are believed to include Parretti's principal
holding company, Com Finance S.A. of Luxembourg; his Melia
International, one of the world's largest travel agencies; and the
Spanish real estate business Renta Inmobiliaria S.A.
   An earlier MGM-UA sale to Pathe fell apart last spring when Time
Warner Inc. backed out of its agreement to finance $650 million of
the deal.
   Pathe spokesman Parsons said company officials are ``very
comfortable'' with production financing, which will be partially
underwritten by ``one new film a month,'' he said.
   No new debt is involved in the deal, Parsons said. MGM-UA
currently has about $400 million in debt and Pathe owes $300
million.
   For MGM-UA's current management, the future is unclear. Chief
executive Jeffrey Barbakow and studio chief Richard Berger did not
return phone calls seeking comment Thursday.
   MGM-UA majority stockholder Kirk Kerkorian offered the Culver
City-based studio for sale in April 1988.
   A spectrum of suitors - including Japan's Sony and C. Itoh,
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the Walt Disney Co. and the Dutch
conglomerate PolyGram - expressed interest in a deal, lured largely
by the United Artists library, which included the ``Rocky'' and
James Bond movies.

FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Games Blockbuster plays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the mid-1980s, two friends working in a garage could produce a perfectly
acceptable video game. Today, says Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin
Communications, teams of 12 to 20 people have to work on games for up to 18
months.
Devereux says: 'We very rarely develop anything for less than a seven figure
sum. We've got Dollars 40m of product in development at the moment. You can
make half a dozen mid-priced movies for that.'
Devereux's company is developing a basketball video game called Hoops. It
will have 19,000 frames of animation. The data storage systems required for
these games are increasingly complex and expensive, he says.
The escalating cost of making video games is one of the reasons why Devereux
welcomes last week's announcement that Blockbuster Entertainment of the US
is to increase its stake in Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE), Virgin's
video software subsidiary, from 20 per cent to 75 per cent.
VIE develops games and entertainment software compatible with Sega and
Nintendo hardware systems. It also devises games for personal computer and
compact disc read-only memory (CD-Rom) systems. It will shortly release
games based on the Walt Disney film of the Jungle Book and the animated
feature movie the Lion King.
Blockbuster, which is the world's biggest video rental company, is to sell
its entire VIE stake to Spelling Entertainment, the Hollywood film
production company in which it has a majority stake.
Devereux says Blockbuster admits it knows little about the development of
video games software. That is why VIE will be owned by Spelling, which is
more familiar with entertainment production.
The London-based Devereux, who is also in charge of Virgin's television,
radio and book publishing activities, will remain chief executive of VIE.
Steven Berrard, Blockbuster's president, will become chairman of VIE.
The advantages of the link with Blockbuster, Devereux says, are the
marketing muscle it will give VIE and the size of the US company's
distribution network: 4,250 shops worldwide.
Another reason why Devereux says he is pleased to be linking up with
Blockbuster is that the video games business is about to enter a difficult
period.
The first problem is that players are becoming bored with the range of games
on offer, he says. The second is that the machines on which the games are
played are going to change in ways that will confuse the consumer.
The industry is moving from cartridge-based games to CD-Rom. Devereux
believes this Christmas will be the last to see substantial sales of the
current generation of 16-bit cartridge-based machines.
Not all of the large games companies, however, will move on to CD-Rom
machines. Sega and Sony will, but Nintendo is bringing out a 64-bit
cartridge-based machine. Another growing development, Devereux believes,
will be CD-Rom games for personal computers.
The fragmentation will make games players reluctant to buy machines until
they know which system is likely to survive, he says.

MGM GRAND PLANS HOLLYWOOD THEME PARK IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the ink scarcely dry on Kirk Kerkorian's deal to sell his 82%-controlled 
MGM/UA Communications Co., the financier announced that his 98%-owned MGM Grand 
Inc. plans to build a movie theme park and new hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The news sent a ripple through Hollywood, because two larger entertainment 
companies -- Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc. -- have committed over $1 billion to 
similarly themed attractions in central Florida, with talk of competing in 
Europe as well. 
</P>
<P>
To further complicate matters, the MGM name already appears on the Disney tour 
in Florida, under a 4-year-old agreement that was unsuccessfully challenged by 
MGM/UA last year in California state court. While that decision is on appeal, 
MGM Grand disclosed Tuesday that it has sued Disney in a Nevada state court to 
establish its right to use the MGM Grand name on theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
At least one analyst expressed skepticism that Kerkorian is firmly committed to 
the theme park undertaking. "Kirk's a very bright guy," the analyst said, 
speaking on the condition that he not be identified. "He does things like this 
constantly. He throws things out just to see what the reaction is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Desert Inn 
</P>
<P>
No immediate reaction could be registered on Wall Street, however, since the 
announcement was made after the close of the stock markets. MGM Grand, which is 
traded over the counter, ended the day at $17 a share, with no change in price. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand, organized three years ago, launched a posh airline offering service 
between New York and Los Angeles in 1987 and bought the Desert Inn the 
following year, along with adjacent undeveloped property in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The company announced Tuesday that it has agreed to pay $28 million for 143 
acres of land on the Desert Inn site, which it presently leases, to provide a 
possible site for the 4,000-room hotel and entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand has previously disclosed plans to raise about $120 million in a stock 
offering which would reduce Kerkorian's stake in the company to about 77%. The 
company intends to proceed with that offering once it clears the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, MGM Grand Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Benninger said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Benninger acknowledged that the company has not yet drawn up plans for its 
entertainment complex, and he said the company has not enlisted a partner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seems Like Lunacy' 
</P>
<P>
But a source at MCA said that company has engaged in preliminary discussions 
with Kerkorian about "possible participation" in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were divided about a movie tour's chances of success in 
gambling-oriented Las Vegas. "There's desert all around. There's no (large) 
population base. That seems like lunacy," one entertainment industry analyst 
declared privately. 
</P>
<P>
But Harold Vogel, Merrill Lynch's veteran analyst, said: "Vegas has been 
evolving to a more family-oriented business, and this, I think, is a natural 
extension of the destination resort concept. I think a lot of people bring 
their family and don't know what to do with their family while they go while 
they go gambling." 
</P>
<P>
(Vogel noted that Merrill Lynch has served as Kerkorian's adviser, so he 
declined to talk about MGM Grand's specific plan.) 
</P>
<P>
With Kerkorian's agreement last Friday to sell MGM/UA Communications to the 
Australian Qintex Group for $1.5 billion, the 72-year-old financier appeared 
ready to relinquish his 20-year-old hold on the beloved MGM name and logo. At 
the time, however, the buyer and seller agreed that MGM Grand would enjoy 
certain licensing rights to the MGM Grand name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Lawsuit Seen 
</P>
<P>
In its California lawsuit, MGM/UA argued that Disney had no right to use the 
name on its movie and television production facility in Florida, which opened 
months before the actual tour. MGM/UA also opposed the construction of hotels 
adjacent to the Disney tour, arguing -- again unsuccessfully -- that MGM Grand 
has exclusive rights to the MGM name on hotels. The decision has been appealed, 
said Skip Miller, the Los Angeles attorney who is handling both the California 
and Nevada cases for Kerkorian. 
</P>
<P>
No lawsuit over the theme park name is anticipated by Qintex, according to 
Kevin Wallace, Qintex America's chief financial officer. "We've worked out a 
special agreement (for) the use of the MGM Grand name and the stylized lion 
logo, which is a different lion (from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion familiar to 
movie-goers) . . . for use in the theme parks and hotels," Wallace said.

Which image best symbolizes Hollywood in the 1980s? The memory nominates 
several candidates: 
</P>
<P>
The bug-eyed latex runt that Steven Spielberg turned into a lovable alien pup 
in "E.T.," the decade's greatest enchantment and the industry's greatest 
box-office performer. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Ford Coppola, the Wunderkind director of the 1970s, standing humbly in 
the midst of his neon-washed Las Vegas set for "One From the Heart," telling a 
few hundred hastily gathered reporters that his great experiment -- Zoetrope 
Studios -- was on the brink of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains looking spiffy in their computer-dyed dinner 
suits in the colorized "Casablanca," a version of the black-and-white classic 
that turned seedy Morocco into Mardi Gras and made us wish Ilsa had been played 
by Carmen Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II reminding an audience of Hollywood leaders of their their 
moral responsibilities in the world at the precise moment when some of them 
were busy running David Puttnam -- the only studio chief to have actually 
raised a moral issue during the decade -- out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Any scene from "Leonard Part VI," arguably the worst major-studio movie ever 
made, which was only made because its creator and star -- comedian and regional 
Coca-Cola bottler Bill Cosby -- was important to Coke-owned Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Snow White bopping with home-video buff Rob Lowe in the desperate opening 
number of this year's Oscar telecast, and the subsequent legal hoohaw when 
Disney threatened to sue the embarrassed Motion Picture Academy for copyright 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, the septuagenarian poster girl for graceless aging, hiking her 
skirt for the cameras during her trial for smacking an uppity Beverly Hills 
cop, and the subsequent announcement that she'll be getting her own TV show 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
While all of these things say something about the decade and the business, none 
captures its essence quite as well as that of a toothless Leo the Lion being 
driven from his Culver City lair where, during Hollywood's Golden Age, he 
reigned over the shiniest kingdom of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Leo didn't roar during the '80s. He was knocked out and vivisected by the 
financial Frankenstein, Kirk Kerkorian, then sold off, organ by organ, to the 
highest bidders. During the decade, the home of Andy Hardy and Dorothy Gale was 
variously owned by MGM/UA, Ted Turner, Lorimar Telepictures and Warner Bros., 
and is about to become the home of Sony subsidiary Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
When Turner bought MGM, he made a rousing speech to the studio's employees 
about restoring the studio to its previous greatness and revealed that the 
effect of "Gone With the Wind" had been so great on him that he stuck a son 
with the name Rhett. Before the staff's eyes were dry, Turner had sold the lot 
to Lorimar Telepictures and made off with his real prize, the MGM library, 
which contained all those great black-and-white classics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they look better in color, pal, and they're my movies," said Turner, 
on one of the many occasions when he told critics of colorization to lump it. 
</P>
<P>
The greed that governed Hollywood in the '80s was not mitigated by many great 
movies. The last American masterpiece, according to no less an authority than 
Steven Spielberg, was "The Godfather Part II," released 15 years ago. Spielberg 
himself shares the blame for the intellectual slump in film production. He and 
George Lucas, starting in the mid-70s, were so skillful at reviving the 
childhood thrill of the matinee adventure that they encouraged a decade of bad 
imitations and convinced Hollywood decision makers that the only audience worth 
wooing was the one in puberty. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s in Hollywood were dedicated to people with the ability to count to 
$200 million. Blockbuster fever, the three-year flu contracted by every new 
major-studio head, resulted in a rash of big, wart-like celluloid bumps. 
</P>
<P>
"Raise the Titanic" cost more than $40 million to make, grossed less than $7 
million at the box office, and had the band playing "Nearer My God to Thee" on 
the stern of Lew Grade's Rank Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Ishtar," a buddy road comedy commissioned by Columbia's Guy McElwaine, was the 
decade's quintessential major-studio misstep. The film teamed three of the best 
known high-salaried perfectionists in the business -- $5-million actors Warren 
Beatty and Dustin Hoffman and $2-million writer-director Elaine May. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement that Columbia was making something called "Ishtar" in North 
Africa with Beatty, Hoffman and May struck some people as the financial 
equivalent of sticking your hand in a running Cuisinart, and the skepticism was 
warranted. "Ishtar" went over schedule, over budget, missed its Christmas 
release date by five months and grossed a fraction of a budget estimated to 
have come in north of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Ishtar" was not the worst big-budget movie of the '80s, or close to it. Nor 
was Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate," the runaway Western that brought ruin to 
United Artists and gave UA production chief Steven Bach the rare opportunity to 
exploit his own incompetence. (Bach wrote the best-selling book "Final Cut," 
explaining how he let Cimino overshoot his budget by $30 million.) 
</P>
<P>
The worst big-budget movie of the '80s was Columbia's "Leonard Part VI," a spy 
fantasy in which retired sleuth Bill Cosby outwitted some mad farm animals who 
were threatening to steal government secrets. Do you suppose this one looked 
good on paper? 
</P>
<P>
Cosby, who came up with the concept and produced the film, added a bizarre 
marketing footnote to the whole saga when he went on national TV just days 
before the movie opened and advised people to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other excesses of the '80s were these truly awful movies: 
</P>
<P>
"Rhinestone," a romantic comedy starring Sylvester Stallone as a goofy New York 
cab driver (so far, so good) who falls in love with Dolly Parton (whoops) and 
ends up winning a country-Western singing contest (yikes). Stallone did his own 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't Stop the Music," Allan Carr's 1980 Village People musical extravaganza, 
co-starred Olympic decathlon champ Bruce Jenner and was directed by Nancy 
Walker, who did better work in the decade portraying the paper-towel savant 
Rosie on those absorbing Bounty TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
And "Howard the Duck," a movie of such waddling ineptitude that the title 
became an instant reference for other failures. (Universal had barely recovered 
from the "Howard" disgrace when critics began dubbing the studio's third "Jaws" 
sequel "Jaws the Duck.") 
</P>
<P>
The blockbuster mentality bred a revolving-door system of studio management, 
with insecure chief executives trying to hustle up megahits before their 
three-year contracts were half up. Scripts were developed by a new generation 
of production executives, baby boomers raised on laugh-track sitcoms and 
disease-of-the-week TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
To them, a social conscience meant watching "Saturday Night Live," a show that 
has indirectly led to more bad big-screen performances than the Ziegfeld 
Follies (thanks, guys, for Bill Murray in "The Razor's Edge"). 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the decade was a black hole for serious film makers. Deals made by one 
studio chief were routinely scuttled by the next. Films started under one 
executive were completed under another and shipped off to regional-release 
hell. ("Sorry, we opened it in Tupelo and nobody wanted to see it.") 
</P>
<P>
The studios that dominated the marketplace, not surprisingly, produced the 
decade's star executives. Michael Eisner and Barry Diller had a good run at 
Paramount, then went off to other glories -- Eisner to work his own magic over 
Disney's kingdom, Diller to run Fox for Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner brought Jeffrey Katzenberg along from Paramount to chair the studio's 
production operations, and though few films of greatness emerged, Disney went 
from a virtual non-player to a position of leadership almost overnight. At the 
beginning of the decade, Disney's animation department was almost moribund, and 
the studio leaders couldn't bring themselves to make mainstream movies with 
violence and dirty words, even though they had created Touchstone Films with 
that in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner and Katzenberg had no such reluctance, and when Bette Midler hit a high 
C with the decade's noisiest big-screen orgasm in "Down and Out in Beverly 
Hills," it was clear that a new day had dawned on Dopey Drive. 
</P>
<P>
If Eisner was chief executive of the decade, Steven Spielberg was the top 
producer. Spreading his creative pollen over several studios, Spielberg 
produced five of the decade's 10 highest-grossing pictures; three for Paramount 
(the "Raiders" trilogy) and two for Universal ("E.T." and "Back to the 
Future"). He also produced several pictures for Warner Bros., including the 
hits "The Color Purple" and "Gremlins." 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg directed most of those films, as well, and was inadvertently caught 
up in the decade's biggest Oscar controversy. Although he won the Directors 
Guild of America award for "The Color Purple" in 1986, he didn't even get a 
nomination from the directors branch of the academy. The film, meanwhile, 
received 11 Oscar nominations, including one for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy Awards show suffered a Nielsen ratings slump in the '80s, partly 
because of the general audience fragmentation due to the advent of cable and 
home video. But the event continued to be criticized for the bloat of its 
antiquated variety-show format, a flaw magnified by the academy's decision to 
shift venues from the relatively cozy Pavilion to the cavernous 6,000-seat 
Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Massive traffic jams got the first Shrine Oscar show off to a dismal start in 
1988 and this year's telecast, produced by Allan Carr, prompted an ad hoc group 
of high-profile industry people to write a letter to Academy president Richard 
Kahn complaining that the event had been a professional embarrassment. Hey, the 
decade was a professional embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Next March, the Oscars move back to the Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor overall quality of movies, the business entered a new boom 
period. The home-video industry, far from the threat it was perceived to be by 
studio chiefs in the late '70s, actually promoted moviegoing. The convenience 
of video rentals created a renewed interest in movies among older viewers and 
broadened the horizons, if not the tastes, of younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
The audience demographics changed dramatically from one end of the decade to 
the other. It began with kids going one way and their parents another; it ended 
in a frenzy of familial togetherness. Family movies are back. 
</P>
<P>
Box-office figures are always distorted, and in the current self-congratulatory 
orgy over toppling records, it is worth noting that most of the records were 
brought on by rising ticket prices. The average cost of a ticket rose from 
$2.69 in 1980 to about $4.40 at the end of 1989. That is a 65% increase in 
prices, compared to about a 10% increase in actual admissions. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of real movie watching, however, the decade saw enormous change. The 
sales and rentals of videocassette movies, a business that didn't exist barely 
10 years ago, surpassed theatrical revenues in the mid-'80s. When all the math 
is in for 1989, the video industry is expected to outgross the theatrical 
playoff of movies by $11 billion to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
When you combine the two movie-driven businesses, and take into account the 
erosion in prime-time network TV viewing, the motion-picture industry appears 
stronger than at anytime since the late '40s. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that the mammoth video revolution proved was that nobody knows how 
big the next revolution will be. The long writers strike of 1988 -- which, in 
part, was about Hollywood's future -- confused members of the guild and the 
public, who had trouble understanding the victories claimed by both sides. 
Clearly, management and the industry guilds are jockeying for shares in future 
revenues from ancillary markets. 
</P>
<P>
There was certainly no revolution regarding women and minorities in film during 
the '80s. Amy Heckerling ends the decade on a high note, having scored a 
$100-million hit with her thinking-baby comedy "Look Who's Talking." But the 
number of women who directed major-studio movies was fewer than a dozen, and 
the number of black directors -- of either sex -- totaled even less. Dawn 
Steel, at Columbia, was the only woman to run a studio; no black did. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the last decade of its first century, Hollywood has some serious 
issues to address. At the top of the list is the inevitable globalization of 
its resources and outlook. With everything that's imminent -- the social and 
cultural waves that will sweep over the world from Eastern Europe and from the 
Pacific -- who is going to set Hollywood's agenda? 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, the creative voices were mostly stilled. The power shifted 
from studio heads to agents and producers, squeezing all but the most facile 
writers and directors out and creating an environment where deals were more 
important than films. Flying in the face of global trends and migration 
patterns, even those in its own community, Hollywood became more insular than 
ever. Once a window opening onto the world, it is now more a window opening 
onto "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an occasional "Gandhi" or "The Last Emperor," both of which were made 
outside the major-studio system, few films with worldly themes were made. The 
farther American film makers went, the closer to home they got. The outer-space 
adventure "Outland" was a virtual remake of "High Noon," with the Frontier 
Ethic in full bloom. The "Star Wars" films were also reset Westerns; the "Star 
Trek" films were U.S. TV reunions. "E.T." was "Lassie Come Home." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the rest of the world still looks upon Hollywood as the capital 
of invention, but it is an appreciation of style rather than of substance. In 
some ways, Hollywood enters the '90s where Detroit entered the '70s: full of 
self-confidence and commitments to short-term goals and domestic impulses. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, we'll learn whether the industry will change its outlook or, like some 
gas-guzzling, 4,000-pound Detroit sedan, get blown off the road.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Flicker on the big picture: Films have had a good year, but
costs are rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When 20th Century Fox released Miracle on 34th Street last month, it hoped
the film would be a Christmas hit. But last week, Fox was forced to offer
'your money back if you don't enjoy it' in a desperate attempt to persuade
US cinema goers to see it.
Miracle is now vying with Kenneth Branagh's critically slated Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein for the dubious honour of becoming the celluloid turkey of
Christmas 1994. Both have flopped badly in the US in a prosperous period for
the movie business, as hit films such as Interview with the Vampire, Star
Trek Generations and The Lion King break records at the box office.
Yet concern is mounting in the industry about the spiralling cost of
film-making and declining profitability. Hollywood was shocked by the recent
announcement that Sony, the Japanese electronics group, had fallen into the
red in the first half of this year after making a Y265bn (Pounds 1.7bn)
write-off on its US film interests.
Sony apart, 1994 has been a good year for the industry on the revenue front.
The US box office has taken more than Dollars 4.5bn so far this year against
Dollars 4.35bn in the same period of 1993, according to Variety, the
industry magazine. Christmas looks set to continue this success, with the
top 30 US films having taken Dollars 100m during last weekend's Thanksgiving
Holiday, ahead of 1993's Dollars 82m.
Business is similarly buoyant in other countries with cinema attendances
rising in new markets in Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America, as well as
in western Europe where there has been heavy investment in new cinemas and
multiplex complexes. Industry estimates suggest that markets outside the US
now represent 60 per cent of box office returns, against 40 per cent 10
years ago.
Despite this, success in the US is usually critical in determining a film's
long-term prospects in other countries. 'This industry is glued to the
Variety league tables,' said Mr Michael Kuhn, chairman of PolyGram Film
Entertainment. 'If a movie isn't a hit when it opens in the US, it generally
won't succeed elsewhere.'
The rewards for successful films are higher than in the past, thanks to the
growth in additional income from video, television and computer games. A
Hollywood blockbuster now makes roughly 40 per cent of its total income from
video, 20 per cent from television, 10 per cent from other sources and just
30 per cent from the cinema.
The studios expect continued growth in these areas. They also hope for a
further boost from video-CDs, which should be widely available by the end of
1995. With image and sound superior to cassettes, they could stimulate video
sales just as compact discs boosted recorded music.
This outlook has brought a flood of new investment to Hollywood. Mr Ted
Turner, the cable TV entrepreneur, and PolyGram, the UK music group, have
increased their film interests in the early 1990s by start-up and
acquisition. Both had hits this year - Mr Turner with The Mask and PolyGram
with Four Weddings and a Funeral - and are now moving on to bigger budget
films.
There is also the arrival of the 'dream team' of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg,
former head of Walt Disney's film division, Mr Steven Spielberg, the
Oscar-winning director, and Mr David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul.
They appear to be having no difficulty in interesting investors in their
plans for a new entertainment group. 'Everyone on Wall Street wants a slice
of that pie,' said one investment banker. Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, the
world's largest software group, is also mooted as a likely investor.
As a result of this influx, the industry has increased its output. More than
200 films have already been released in the US this year, against 190 in the
same period of 1993, according to Hollywood Reporter, the trade magazine.
There are now 252 films in production or pre-production, 44 more than at
this time last year.
The crowded market is forcing the studios to pay more to attract stars. The
'talent' deals hit the headlines - such as the news that New Line, one of Mr
Turner's film subsidiaries, will pay Dollars 12m to Ms Julia Roberts and
Dollars 8m to Ms Meg Ryan to star in its remake of The Women, the 1939
classic.
But marketing costs are also escalating as competition intensifies. The
total marketing budget of a Dollars 40m or Dollars 50m film will typically
be Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m, with roughly Dollars 12m spent in the first
weekend of a US launch. It can cost more to publicise a small film than to
make it: Four Weddings and a Funeral took less than Dollars 5m to produce,
but PolyGram spent Dollars 18m on publicity in the US.
'Why is movie marketing so expensive? Because people panic,' said Mr Frank
Mancuso, chairman of MGM. 'There's so much money at stake when a film comes
out. If the marketplace is cluttered, you've got to shout very loud to make
your voice heard.'
The increase in costs make unsuccessful films even more expensive. The
failure of Frankenstein could cost Sony tens of millions of dollars.
And even for the successful films, the returns may not be spectacular. Most
studios now spread the risk of a flop by bringing in other investors or
paying the stars with part of the profits. This cushions their exposure to
flops, but also reduces their profits on hits.
'We're in a situation where it costs more to make a motion picture but the
returns are getting smaller and smaller,' said Mr Sidney Sheinberg,
president of MCA/Universal.
As Sony's plight suggests, this situation cannot continue indefinitely.
'Assuming that this industry is composed of people not all of whom are
totally stupid,' says Mr Sheinberg, 'we've got to do something to stop it.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney expands in video
games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday joined other film studios
diversifying into video and computer games by launching an interactive
entertainment division.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive, announced the creation of
the division, which will co-ordinate Disney's activities in the games and
educational software markets at its headquarters in Burbank, California.
Disney has in the past licensed the rights to develop video games from its
cartoon and film characters to other companies.
However, it recently devised the successful Aladdin and The Lion King games
in conjunction with Virgin Interactive Entertainment, part of the Viacom
group. Last month it launched two CD-ROM products: the Aladdin Activity
Center and Disney's Animated StoryBook.
The group is now expanding its Disney Software subsidiary into an
interactive division to accelerate its move into games and educational
software.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Walt Disney prepares to share the pain: Restructuring at the
European park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past two weeks a team of executives from Walt Disney's Los Angeles
headquarters has been holed up in a Paris lawyers' office trying to piece
together a rescue deal for Euro Disney, the stricken European leisure group.
Their efforts were rewarded on Sunday when the Disney negotiators and a
steering committee of Euro Disney's banks, signed an outline agreement for a
package worth roughly FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) that should save Euro Disney
from the receivers.
But the critical questions are what the restructuring means for the finances
of Euro Disney and its US parent?
When Walt Disney first mapped out a European version of its hugely
successful US theme parks, it calculated it would make a profit from its
opening year. Instead, Euro Disney, which opened in April 1992, produced a
net loss of FFr188m in the year to September 30, 1992, and thudded into a
bigger deficit of FFr5.3bn the following year.
Euro Disney had some operational problems, aggravated by the economic
recession which meant that, although attendance levels were almost in line
with expectations at around 11m in the first year, expenditure at the park
fell below expectations.
But the crux of Euro Disney's difficulties was its financial structure.
Disney had financed EuroDisneyland's construction through the flotation of
the remaining 51 per cent stake and through loans. Euro Disney had
originally expected to reduce its debt by selling property around the park,
but the recession forced it to abandon this. Meanwhile the high rate of
French interest rates raised the cost of servicing its remaining debt.
Early last year the company hoped to restructure its finances by persuading
its bankers to relax the terms of their loans. But when the recession
deepened it realised that more drastic action was required. In November
Disney summoned the banks to tell them it would support Euro Disney until
March 31 but that, unless a rescue was agreed, it would pull the plug and
Euro Disneyland would close.
The two sides have since been thrashing out an agreement. The main elements
are a FFr6bn rights issue and a FFr1.4bn transaction whereby Disney will
lease two of the theme park rides. - the Temple of Doom and Discovery
Mountain. The US group will also waive its rights to royalties and
management fees for five years: while the banks will accept an 18 month
interest holiday on their loans.
This package should halve Euro Disney's debt from FFr20.3bn to FFr10bn. The
company should also save FFr800m a year in interest charges and FFr450m in
payments to Disney. Euro Disney now hopes to break even next year. Ms
Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, is less
optimistic. She forecasts a net loss of FFr1.5bn in the year to September 30
and another loss of FFr140m next year before Euro Disney returns a net
profit of FFr450m in 1995/96.
However, analysts say the deal is positive for Walt Disney and its chairman,
Mr Michael Eisner, and while the parent is going to have to suffer its share
of Euro Disney pain, along with other investors and lenders, the burden is
well within the range Wall Street was expecting.
The fresh equity injection of Dollars 520m (Pounds 356m) will be in a
company with a better structured capital base, and which therefore stands a
chance of eventually making a return on the investment. Ms Jessica Reif, of
Oppenheimer &amp; Co, believes that the lease financing deal, together with the
equity, will take Walt Disney's total new financing commitment up to around
Dollars 750m 'and we think over the long term Disney will more than recoup
that'.
Disney's loss of royalties and management fees will not hurt much either.
These only amounted to Dollars 36.3m last year, a small sum relative to Walt
Disney's Dollars 1.7bn of operating income, and no one on Wall Street had
expected them to survive the restructuring.
On the positive side, the deal removes a large element of investor
uncertainty over the fate of Euro Disney, and the financial implications for
Walt Disney. The uncertainty has been hanging over the US company's stock
for months, undermining an otherwise strong earnings outlook.
Walt Disney reported a 34 per cent jump in first quarter net income, to
Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share, and analysts said yesterday's outline
settlement would have no impact on their full-year earnings per share
forecasts of Dollars 2.10 to Dollars 2.15, up around 30 per cent from last
year.
The strongest earnings growth will come from the film business. The Lion
King, an animated movie due for summer release in the US, is expected to be
a big success, as will the release on video of Snow White. Disney's US theme
parks should also see renewed growth, helped by the opening of more
attractions.
Mr Christopher Dixon, at New York brokers PaineWebber, says that these
factors 'and a final solution to the Euro Disney mess should go a long way
to restoring investor confidence'. Walt Disney shares, he believes, 'are
well positioned to move up from here'. Adds Ms Reif: 'Disney has more
positive catalysts than any other company I follow over the next six
months.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Bitten by the Golden Lions - Nigel Andrews survives
the film festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE in a state of advanced mental befuddlement this year, pink
elephants have been replaced by golden lions. With prize night still two
days off, we have been bombarded with the beasts. Steven Spielberg,
breasting a sea of Jurassic Park mania, came to accept a career achievement
Lion. On the same night Spielberg himself tried to present a special Lion to
veteran director and Venice festival chief Gillo Pontecorvo. 'No, no, you
keep it]' said Signor P, clearly suffering from lion confusion himself. And
to top things off, the TV screens in the festival theatre lobby have been
re-pumping endless footage of past Venice winners winning past Golden Lions.
Lionitis is a notifiable cultural disease, so we critics have been comparing
notes as to the likeliest victim on prize night. Robert Altman may draw the
short paw for Short Cuts, his majestic three-hour fresco of Los Angeles life
(reported on last week). Then again Maria Luisa Bemberg's Don't Talk About
It, Rolf De Heer's Bad Boy Bubby and Krzystof Kieslowski's Blue have all
been lionised by different segments of the festival audience.
The Argentinian film comes from the lady who gave us Miss Mary and I, The
Worst Of All: Bunuel-suave tales of sex, gnomic violence and religious
dissidence. Drawn from a Magic Realist novel by Iulio Llinas, Don't Talk
About It tells of dwarf girl Carlotta, her normal-height widowed mother who
hopes to marry her off, and Marcello Mastroianni as a lovestruck charmer who
keeps travelling round the world and back again before finally popping the
question to the girl.
This short/tall, May/December, wanderer/homebody romance is just one of the
film's dotty charms. Bemberg draws a portrait of the little town as rich as
a Marques story. Gossip is the main local industry, closely followed by
social hypocrisy. When the Mayor dies in the middle of a wedding - that
wedding - everyone pretends not to notice; and he is shoved into a bathful
of ice-cubes afterwards so as not to spoil the party. Like an impossible
wine the film goes its sweet, dry, intoxicating way towards an ending no
less startling and funny for being utterly inevitable.
Bad Boy Bubby from Australia takes Magic Realism and turns it into - let us
register a new genre - Agit-Surrealism. Dutch-born writer-director Rolf De
Heer has a nasty mind and wants to share it with us. His hero (Nicholas
Hope) is an overgrown baby held hostage into his 20s by a large and lustful
Mum. She keeps him at home (grey walls, cockroaches) right up to the day
that Dad (dog collar, dirty beard) returns, encouraging the boy to kill them
both with Clingwrap. Then it is out into the world with Hope, mixing his
perceptual innocence and untutored morals with every dodgy group from a
Salvation Army platoon via a grunge rock band to a cerebral palsy ward.
Good taste? De Heer has never heard of it. Sex, murder, foul language and
blasphemy are on tap, plus enough political incorrectness to set back the
cause of group dogma by a century. For its first half-hour Bad Boy Bubby
seems like one of those essays in onanistic outrage we expect from young
directors. But it gathers its awful logic around it like a mudstained robe
and by the close is dispensing a marvellous cauterising wit and wisdom.
Blue is the latest film in the colour-fashion of the year. Britain's Derek
Jarman has lent the title to Poland's Krszystof Kieslowski who goes to Paris
to tell the tale of a young woman (Juliette Binoche) battling bereavement
pains. Husband and daughter lost in car crash; ghosts from past and ghouls
from future humming towards her; and a film that becomes an unforgettable
series of still lives stirred to sinister movement, as 'everyday' objects
and events turn into a danse macabre of the soul.
The film opens soon in Britain. So do several of the myriad American movies
that maestro Pontecorvo waved into Venice, using a baton that seems to have
magical power over all of Hollywood. The VIPs glittered as they came:
Harrison Ford, Tina Turner, Robert De Niro, Madonna, Woody Allen, Daniel
Day-Lewis, Martin Scorsese, Spielberg . . . This is a struggling,
underfunded film festival on the Adriatic? Gaze on your thrice-larger
budget, Cannes, and despair.
Many of the directors attended Venice's much-puffed Artist's Rights
conference. This 48-hour thinkathon began with public speeches under Tiepolo
ceilings, went private for a day and a half's commission work, then unveiled
its resolutions in the Lido's Hotel De Bains (setting for Visconti's Death
In Venice). One hundred and twenty world film-makers gathered, putting the
event on a par with an Oscars ceremony. Result: the founding of a High Court
For The Freedom Of Expression In Cinema And The Audio-Visual Arts (where but
in Italy can one spirit up a high court at will?), several proposed GATT
reformations and a mile-long paperchase of decrees and sub-decrees.
Being sceptical about auteurs and auteurs' rights in a collaborative
high-cost art like cinema, I look forward to dissecting this symposium
later. Not here, nor now. Venice is in the madness of wind-up phase. We must
mention the films that boasted, if not quality, large quantities of vitality
or eccentricity. Jean-Luc Godard's Helas Pour Moi: hurling poetry,
philosophy and jagged mise-en-scene at star Gerard Depardieu as we and he
wander round scenic Lake Geneva. Clara Law's You Seng from Hong Kong: its
6th century battle scenes like painted scrolls come to life. Robert De
Niro's directing debut A Bronx Tale: pouring doo-wop music over a catchy
story of Italian-American boyhood. Dominic Sena's Kalifornia: a road-movie
with murders, in which bad couple Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis get their
kicks on Route 66. And Abel Ferrara's Snake Eyes: Harvey Keitel and Madonna
rising (mostly) above a steamy-specious script about movie-making.
There were also booby prize contenders. A Plastic Lion ex aequo should go to
Joseph Kay and John Yorick's The Hollow Men, in which a terminal Euro-beach
plays host to murky photography and ear-bashing alterations of Verdi music
with existential dialogue, and to the portentous agonies of Joao Botelho's
Here On Earth, 90 minutes of pained attitudinising in which Munch's 'The
Scream' seems to have visited Portugal and bitten the whole country.
Disappointing also were two films from well-loved veterans, Ermanno Olmi's
The Secret Of The Old Wood and Eric Rohmer's The Tree, The Mayor And The
Cultural Centre. Olmi's film is a green fable about an endangered forest,
full of talking animals and Disneyish whimsy. Rohmer's film is a Green fable
about local politics and Euro-environmentalism: as thrilling as a Party
Political Broadcast by Jonathan Porritt in French.
The Lion looks on all these candidates and sharpens its claws. But Venice is
not just about 'Who wins?' Every year it conjures variety and inquiry,
sideshows and seminars, from a budget that was never large and is getting
smaller. This year we had retrospectives (a look back at 1943 in world
cinema); discussion events ('Music and Cinema' with Ennio Morricone, 'Opera
and Cinema' with Riccardo Muti); documentaries and video programmes
(including Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's brilliant TV series on DW
Griffith); and the Artists' Rights think-in. Sometimes at Venice the critic
feels as if he has gone back to school again. But in a festival as
multi-faceted as this, and as unapologetic about shaking hands with
Hollywood, there are as many school treats as school trials.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: The great fame drain - British cinema talent is being
colonised by a predatory Hollywood. But, argues Nigel Andrews, we should
simply lie back and enjoy it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

Colin Welland, waving that famous statuette, said 'the British are coming'.
But the Chariots Of Fire Oscar triumph was 15 years ago. More recently, the
British have indeed been coming, all over the movie landscape, but not quite
in the way envisaged by Welland.
A select committee of British MPs on a fact-finding visit last week to
Hollywood were reported to have been told by Steven Spielberg: 'There is no
British film industry.' Half a generation after our cinema thought it would
conquer the world by sitting tight and making home-bred history epics, we
have replaced a dominion movie culture with a diaspora movie culture. Many
British films, directors and actors now find themselves in the position of
being lucrative exports without any early life in a British factory or
warehouse.
Look at yesterday's key players. Richard Attenborough has returned to his
acting roots to make Jurassic Park and the forthcoming Christmas film
Miracle On 34th Street, after falling gently down the ladder of directorial
bankability from Cry Freedom to Shadowlands. And the Chariots
writer-producer duo of Colin Welland and David Puttnam have released a
humble childrens' comedy, The War Of The Buttons, with about as much Oscar
potential as an episode of Jackanory.
Meanwhile two of British cinema's one-time traitors and fugitives have
returned to become its all-hailed messiahs. The gone-Hollywood brothers
Ridley and Tony Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Top Gun, True Romance) have
bought Shepperton Studios, with the aim of turning it into an England-based
blast kiln for international cinema.
With luck this move - and its symbolic imprimatur for anti-nationalist
adventurism - will see the end of siege mentality cinema forever in this
country. By free movement in and out of other nations and cultures, British
cinema is creating a virtual new renaissance.
In many cases individual British movies and actors find that by going to
America first - followed by the rest of the world - they can make an
international impact almost before home audiences have heard of them. Four
Weddings And A Funeral, which opened in the US several weeks before its UK
release, has just become the most commercially successful British film of
all time. Why the jackpot? Because the film jumped straight into a foreign
market, rightly suspecting that selling itself to an outsiders' view of
Britain was better than selling itself direct to Britain herself.
If Weddings had opened first at home we might have dismissed it - knowing
our country too well - as a frothy piece of anyone-for-tennis comedy
romance. America and other countries, allowed a first glimpse, decided to
see it as quintessential Britain: as a mini-genre - the silly ass comedy -
gone mythic.
What director Mike Newell had done, much as Ridley and Tony Scott and other
Anglos had done to Hollywood's own action thrillers or sci-fi films, was to
raise the style stakes so that a little timeless archetypalism (even a
little post-modern preposterousness) upstaged or transcended the realism.
It is not just British films and directors, it is British actors that
America - and a world movie public following America - are now picking off
the remaindered shelves of British indifference.
For years Hugh Grant, formerly of Maurice (1987) and A Handful Of Dust
(1988), ranked nowhere as a movie presence. His comic potential was ignored
by most fellow Brits even in Bitter Moon, a highly promising trial run for
Four Weddings. In America, after Weddings opened, Grant's face launched a
thousand popularity polls and graced a dozen magazine covers. Once again
foreign eyes and ears had sensed a distilled and perfect 'Britishness' that
we were deaf and blind to.
It is part of a swelling tide of Anglophilia to which British cinema would
be foolish to play Canute, or to complain that we are 'selling out' to other
people's caricaturing vision of us.
Grant is rare only in being a nice chap in a British casting directory -
nay, an entire export industry - largely dominated by nasty chaps. Hollywood
comes to us for its villains. These have included Alan Rickman (Die Hard,
Robin Hood), Anthony Hopkins (Silence Of The Lambs), Jeremy Irons (Reversal
Of Fortune, The Lion King), Charles Dance (Last Action Hero) and Stuart
Wilson (No Escape), to name but the vanguard. (Actresses, nice or nasty,
export more slowly. But Emma Thompson is currently up there above-the-title
with Arnie, Danny De Vito and company.).
Why are the foreigners going for this new improved Brit pack? Partly because
our actors, theatre-honed, offer a performance panache increasingly
unavailable among American stars, who are either riddled with
late-generation Method tics (Hoffman, De Niro, Pacino) or branded with I for
Iconic Inanition (Schwarzenegger, Stallone).
But it may also be because Britain today is a uniquely placed buffer
culture. These pedigree toffs of ours, moving between suave villainy and
lovable silliness, belong to a country itself poised, in the dangerous days
of Gatt, between the moustache-twirlers of Europe and the honest folk back
in America.
In an age when the US is terrified of being left behind in the Great
Classiness Handicap, with Europe's countries banding together to cock a
high-culture snook at the new world, a love-hate romance is growing in
Hollywood with the one common-language country that US movies can recruit to
represent the old world's values for the new. Euro-awareness may also be why
Scorsese in The Age Of Innocence and Coppola in Dracula and Spielberg in
Schindler's List are increasingly turning to Euro-tinged subjects.
So while Hollywood seizes on British actors as special messengers of
erudition, elocution or patrician charm, audiences have flocked to Four
Weddings And A Funeral, believing there is a lost world out there, somewhere
near Europe, where fluffy, lovable, rambling human stories can happen:
stories that have no resemblance to America's own fast-food cinema of car
chases, cop action and ravening dinosaurs.
A decade and a half after we took 'Britishness' so seriously, after winning
that bunch of Oscars, that we thought the future lay in exporting UK
pageantry for ever and ever, we discover that the future for British cinema
 -its popular cinema at least - does not really lie with us at all. It lies
with those who better judge our charms and international selling-points and
have better equipment for marketing it. Our turn to be colonised and
exploited? If so, we should lie back and enjoy it.

THE MASK (PG) Charles Russell
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (15) Alex Cox
PUBLIC ACCESS Bryan J. Singer
In a startling raid on the American box office, a little-known man with a
mask and array of vocal disguises has climbed to the top of the charts.
Dislodging Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks on the way, he
has already made off with over Dollars 100m. The law - the law of movie
probability, that is - stands helplessly by, seeking the breath to blow its
police whistle.
This has happened before: if only once in recent times. Two years ago a
cartoon genie with a similar fondness for high-speed 'schtick' and
smash-and-grab impersonations shinned to the top of the movie polls. But in
that film, Aladdin, the protean lamp-creature was voiced by the
crowd-pulling Robin Williams. In this week's The Mask we have Canadian-born
comic Jim Carrey, whom almost none of us have heard of: or if we have, only
as the man dusting for pawprints in the now forgotten romp Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective.
But the Chameleon Factor has worked again; 1990s audiences evidently go
dotty for fast-track metamorphosis played for mirth. Carrey is humble bank
employee Stanley Ipkiss, whose life is transformed when he stumbles on an
ancient mask (never mind how) with the power to re-mould (never mind why),
over and over and ad lib, its owner's appearance.
Abracadabra. From a human worker-ant in 'Edge City, USA,' a fantasy town
with a remarkable resemblance to Los Angeles, the Mittyish Mr Ipkiss can now
mutate at will. Mostly he turns into a dashing, yellow-suited, green-faced
lounge lizard with elastic limbs and organs - his eyes pop, his jaw drops
two feet, even his heart jumps out cartoon-like at the sight of a beautiful
girl - and a tendency to whirl tornado-like in and out of scenes. He gets
the girl (blonde and sumptuous Cameron Diaz). He gets the crooks. He
certainly gets the audience.
The special effects are - no hyperbole - astonishing. They are by Industrial
Light and Magic, the sorcery workshop founded by George 'Star Wars' Lucas.
If the art of optical magic goes on like this, Roger Rabbit will soon seem
like a flicker book from the Dark Ages and Snow White like a cave painting
animated by guttering firelight.
First cousin to Williams's genie, Jim Carrey gives as good vocally as he
gets visually. Edward G. Robinson, Clark Gable, James Cagney and others pour
from the larynx. (This is a 1940s-style crime plot with Carrey chasing a
gang of Warners-style crooks, so do not expect up-to-date impersonations).
And when our indestructible-when-masked hero performs a mock death scene
before the hoodlums who think they have gunned him down, we get a full
bouquet of 'famous last words' perennials in about 30 seconds flat.
Twangy-sentimental cowboy valediction; Tiny Tim cockney; even Rhett Butler
choking out 'Tell Scarlett I do give a damn.'
Virtuosic. And directed likewise by Charles Russell, a fugitive from the
Nightmare On Elm Street series. Our only quibble: a hundred minutes is a
long time to sit there being strafed by one performer, even one kissed with
talent, even one who slides in and out of the coat of many colours provided
by the FX folks. A chittering demon inside the spectator says, 'Yes, but
what is it all for?' The Mask is not so much a movie, more a feature-length
demo reel for the wonders of digital conjuring on screen. You end up
enthused by the product but wondering, before you take out your cheque book,
whether you should not wait a little longer while they improve the
story-packaging.
We still have not quite answered the question. Why do today's audiences like
this mach-2 metamorphic style so much? The other big hits of the summer in
America have been The Lion King, the new piece de prestidigitation from the
Disney animators, and Forrest Gump, in which Tom Hanks roams through time
being magicked by trick photography into encounters with the famous.
Have audiences become too quick, too screen-smart, to put up with the old
narrative dawdle, let alone the old po-faced naturalism? If a film is slow -
unless it is deep-down good - the cliches can be skewered and roasted by
filmgoers who have sharpened their wits on video and computer games. If a
film is un-self-aware, we have a generation who drank post-modernism with
their mother's milk. They know that in the ludic 1990s you can now have your
cake (disbelief-suspension) and eat it (munch on the make-believe tricks
whenever they expose themselves).
So we wonder if there is room for movies like the week's other duo, Highway
Patrolman and Public Access. British director Alex Cox's career is a hard
luck story. He used to make sportive films that broke the frame of
illusionism - the spoof Western Straight To Hell, the anachronism-stuffed
historical epic Walker - but they failed at the box office. So he has gone
to Mexico and back to the drawing-board.
Highway Patrolman (in Spanish with subtitles) is a straight-up genre movie:
part action thriller, part moral melodrama. Will our rookie police hero
(Robert Sosa) defy the corruption prevailing among his fellow cops and do
the brave and decent things out there on the blistering tarmac? Like
arresting drug dealers, shooting rabid dogs, and trying to find a joke in
Lorenzo O'Brien's solemnly righteous screenplay.
Cox provides a strong mise-en-scene, full of long takes and startling
landscapes. The climax at a crack-in-the-earth desert location is
marvellous. But in today's mercurial movie world, Highway Patrolman seems
almost dottily old-fashioned. As we watch the protagonist gain one martyring
handicap after another while the story racks up its reversals, from a facial
scar to a bullet-ridden limp, we feel we are back in the days of On The
Waterfront or The Defiant Ones: when good men did what they gotta do and
audiences sat there dumbly, drinking in the moral lessons.
Public Access is no better: indeed rather worse. Cox, we know, can make good
movies (Repo Man). But debut American director Bryan J. Singer seems able to
press only two letters on his creative keyboard. One is P for portentous, in
this tale of a young stranger (Ron Marquette) taking over a small town's
public-access TV network to spread malice, menace and finally murder. The
other is S for stilted, as the film's shadowy-paranoid style - Marquette may
be a right-wing provocateur - invokes the worst excesses of the
sanctimonious 1960s/'70s (The Parallax View, Winter Kills.)
Here it all is again. The belief that if you are not a decent liberal, you
are an indecent (and probably homicidal) redneck; that if you swathe a film
in chiaroscuro and score it for laconic dialogue, you have - hey presto] - a
film noir; that by explaining nothing about your mystery anti-hero, you will
make him a great existential icon.
There are worse things than a film that takes itself seriously. But there
are few worse things than a film that goes back to yesterday's fashions to
do so and fails utterly to renew those fashions for today.

<BYLINE>At the Movies: ``Do the Right Thing'' ^By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When Island Pictures released ``She's Gotta Have It,'' about a
sexually independent young woman, Spike Lee was lionized as the
leader of a new wave of independent filmmaking. He had made the 1986
lusty black-and-white movie for an amazing $175,000.
   He spent millions more for ``Do the Right Thing,'' and with this
frank, realistic and brutal portrait of racism and its byproducts,
the brash young filmmaker has entered the mainstream.
   Race was not an issue in ``She's Gotta Have It.'' In his last
film, ``School Daze,'' Columbia Pictures' biggest grosser for 1988,
Lee was strident and polemical in his treatment of racial issues.
But in ``Do the Right Thing,'' he allows the movie itself to unravel
and define bigotry.
   The theme for the movie's title comes from a speech made by the
late black activist Malcolm X in December 1964: ``Racism is a human
problem and a crime that is absolutely so ghastly that a person who
is fighting racism is well within his rights to fight against it by
any means necessary until it is eliminated.''
   Malcolm X, and the late Nobelist Martin Luther King Jr., both
play an indirect role in the movie, which takes place in a
lower-middle-class neighborhood in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn. It is a longing to include photographs of the late civil
rights leaders on a ``wall of fame'' in a pizza parlor run by an
Italian that sparks a tragic racial confrontation. The Italian owner
has only the pictures of white Italian-Americans on his wall, such
as Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren.
   It is a sweltering summer in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Perspiration
runs freely, as do fire hydrants and tempers.
   Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two sons, Vito and Pino, open their
pizzeria to start a new day. Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), an ancient
resident who spends his time washing down the yesteryears with a
bottle of beer, sweeps up; Mookie (Lee) arrives in Dodgers shirt
(they were once the Brooklyn Dodgers, folks) ready to do his
delivery chores.
   On the street, Radio Raheem, a young man of few words and an
intense scowl, lumbers about with a ghetto blaster the size of a
minitruck forcing the world to listen to rap music. The stuttering
Smiley lopes about trying to sell pictures of King and Malcolm X.
Buggin Out, the local activist, grouses about how there are no
blacks on the ``wall of fame,'' and yet only blacks and Hispanics
frequent the pizza parlor.
   Lee's neighborhood mosaic slowly takes shape with sharp images of
human character. Tensions and conflicts abound: Mookie and the young
woman who gave birth to his son; Radio Raheem and the Hispanic kids;
Radio Raheem and Sal; Buggin Out and Sal; Sal and Pino; Vito and
Pino; Mookie and Pino.
   It is the final confrontation between the hothead and racist Pino
and Radio Raheem that culminates in the movie's violent end. Raheem
is murdered by police; people on the block respond by destroying
Sal's pizzeria.
   Lee does not set up a frenzied, random or mob-inspired reaction.
Indeed, it is Mookie, a character who easily talks to everyone and
who plays the role of peacekeeper, who casts the first stone. He is,
as Malcolm X advised, doing whatever is necessary to fight racism.
   As Sal, the Italian who has run a business in a black
neighborhood for 25 years, Aiello is splendid. Davis is endearing as
the downtrodden Da Mayor, and his wife, Ruby Dee, has a wonderful
character in Da Mayor's love interest, Mother Sister. John Torturro
does a believable stupid punk as the racist Pino, and Bill Nunn is
menacing as Raheem.
   The movie introduces Rosie Perez in the role of Tina, Mookie's
girlfriend. She also does some explosive dancing with the opening
titles. However, as an actress, her lines are muddled.
   Lee has created something of a repertory company with his films,
and one sees familiar faces in them all. His sister, Joie Lee, who
co-starred in ``She's Gotta Have It,'' returns as Mookie's gracious
sister, Jade, who is adored by Sal. Giancarlo Esposito, who has
co-starred in Lee's two major releases, plays Buggin Out.
   Esposito has found his niche with Lee: In ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' he was a nacissistic dandy; in ``School Daze,'' he was a
narcissistic fraternity brother; as Buggin Out, he's self-righteous.
   As for Lee, he has never really thought of himself as an actor.
Yet, he always puts in a star performance. His direction is tight,
and the mood he creates leaves one as hot as the characters on the
screen.
   Lee has a powerful movie, whose truths may repel those who
continue to deny that racism is indeed woven into the fabric of
American life.
   The 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks production is rated R.

<HEAD>Monterey Looks for Federal Law to Help Evict Sea Lions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Monterey harbor has become a sort of
Sea Lion Motel where the sardines are plenty and the living is
easy. But the pinnipeds may soon face eviction as officials renew
their fight to roust the mammals.
   City officials hope to drive away the mammals by enforcing a
proposed amendment to a 1972 federal law that protects sea lions
from harm. The change, which could go into effect early next year,
would make it illegal to feed marine mammals, putting an end to
concessionaires selling sea lion snacks that tourists have used to
lure the animals to shore.
   ``To the average Joe, the sea lions look like something out of a
Walt Disney movie, but until you go down to the docks and stand
right next to one of these monsters, it's hard to understand what
the city is dealing with,'' said Mitch Whippern, administrative
assistant for the Monterey Public Facilities Department.
   Most of the hundreds of sea lions who gather off the Monterey
coast sun themselves on rocks about a football field away from the
harbor. But tourists have lured dozens of the animals to the wharf
and onto floating boat slips - to the dismay of city officials and
fishermen.
   A dozen of the 300- to 800-pound mammals recently climbed on a
tugboat and sank it. Others have prevented some boat owners from
docking. The city has spent $40,000 so far this year repairing sea
lion damage at the docks.
   Whippern said city officials have tried to scare away the sea
lions by spraying them with high pressure hoses, banging together
garbage cans, hitting brooms against the docks and using an
ultrasonic whistle.
   ``If we had a guy out there with a hose all day we could keep
them off, but if you leave for a minute they come right back,''
Whippern said.

<TEXT>
   Few stars remain from Hollywood's Golden Age.
Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Bette Davis _ all long gone. The survivors
_ James Stewart, Katharine Hepburn, Myrna Loy _ rarely make movies
anymore.
   But one popular collection of screen idols has endured, looks
undiminished by age: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy. How old are
they? Only their illustrators know for sure. But they've been
around more than 50 years, and should last at least 50 more.
   Their studio is intact as well. Hollywood's happiest endings
still come from Walt Disney Pictures. Nothing like a cartoon to
stop time, and even pull it back a little. Only at Disney are glass
slippers, handsome princes and magic wands accepted without
reservation.
   The latest animated spectacular from the Disney machine is ``The
Little Mermaid,'' a feature that's bound to generate more big bucks
for the highly successful studio. Disney's last animated feature,
``Oliver and Company,'' has grossed about $50 million. A re-release
this year of ``Peter Pan'' has pulled in $30 million. Although
Disney officials wouldn't disclose how much ``The Little Mermaid''
cost to make, those in the industry put it between $10 million and
$15 million.
   Cynics better stay away from ``The Little Mermaid.'' They'll
never believe this one, something about a beautiful, blue-eyed
mermaid falling in love with a handsome prince, and goodness
defeating the evil sea witch.
   Of course, cynics wouldn't have sat through ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs,'' ``Cinderella'' or ``Bambi,'' either. And as Disney
Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg explained, ``The Little Mermaid'' takes
a lot of its glitter from those golden oldies.
   ``I wanted us to make a film that had the look and feel and the
entertainment and lushness of `Pinocchio,''' he said in a recent
interview.
   ``If you talk with writers, directors, animators, designers,
effects people, layout artists _ across the board in this movie _
all the refreneces that I made, the goals I kept setting for them
were, `Can't we do something that is like `Pinocchio.'''
   ``The Little Mermaid'' is rated, naturally, ``G,'' for general
audiences. That's how Katzenberg sees it. Say the film is for
children and he'll grimace, his eyes widening, the jaw stretching.
Family entertainment means the entire family, he insists.
   ``They're fantastic stories, they're not children's stories.
They're great stories and they're made for the kid inside everyone
of us as opposed to made for children; there's a real distinction
there.
   ``We try to make it very intelligent, very smart, very
sophisticated. There is very little about the film that is
cartoonish. Even when it's animal characters that are speaking,
you'll notice it's very sophisticated.''
   Ask about romance, action, drama, and Katzenberg will talk
strategy, borrowing a page from film mogul Samuel Goldwyn, who
insisted the world needed laughter when his competitors were
serious, and lamented the disappearance of ``messages'' when others
turned out comedies.
   But animation belongs to Disney. Who would want to compete with
``The Ugly Ducking,'' ``Peter Pan,'' ``Fantasia'' and dozens of
others?
   It's a tradition Katzenberg wouldn't dream of touching, although
a little retouching doesn't hurt. For ``The Little Mermaid,'' based
on the Hans Christian Andersen story, that means the richest
colors; the brightest melodies, courtesy of ``Little Shop of
Horrors'' composer Alan Menken; and the most vivid illustrations,
often resembling the performers _ Buddy Hackett and Pat Carroll
among them _ who provide the voices.
   Nothing is left to chance. Everyone has to rehearse, even
mermaids.
   ``There's not a sequence in the film in which there are human
characters not staged and shot on film and used as references in
order to make sure that the human characters moved very much like
people move.
   ``We built an eight-foot tank, put a lady in it and had her swim
around a lot to get the sense of movement and hair _ how it moves
through the water, and the sense of weightlessness.''
   ``The Little Mermaid'' is just the beginning. Katzenberg talks
of a ``renaissance'' for Disney animation. So get ready to see
those ageless stars dusted off again. When the studio needed a lead
for its version of ``The Prince and the Pauper,'' to be released
late in 1990, Mickey Mouse got the call. Minnie Mouse, Goofy,
Donald Duck and Pluto will co-star.
   Also in the works are ``Beauty and the Beast''; ``An Arabian
Night,'' the story of Aladdin and his magic lamp; ``Swan Lake'';
and ``King of the Jungle.''
   And why bother with surveying the public. Numbers, box-office
numbers, speak louder than words.
   Seeing is make-believing has always been Disney's unofficial
motto.
   ``I want people going out of this movie saying: `God, I haven't
been affected like this, I haven't seen anything like this for
years, music that much fun and that much part of the movie,'''
Katzenberg said.
   ``It's a musical, it's a love story, it's emotional. You feel
very sad for this girl who loses everything, happy for her at the
end. What you're hoping to do is get a reaction. Each movie looks
for something different; some make you laugh, some make you cry.
Each one is a different thrill.''

<TEXT>
   Lions may be king of the jungle, but two of
them cowered in fear when they found themselves in the middle of a
busy highway.
   The pair fell out of a trailer during rush hour Tuesday on
Interstate 40. A witness said the trailer door opened and the lions
``just rolled out.''
   ``We don't know how it came open,'' said owner Jerry Garrett, a
pet shop proprietor in Purcell who was pulling the trailer. ``After
they landed, they just sat there and cowered. They were scared.''
   Neither of the lions, Sampson and Casey, was injured.
   Animal control officers used a tranquilizer gun to sedate them
before using nooses to load them back into the trailer. ``They were
pretty docile. We just took precautions,'' said Lt. Stewart Meyer,
Highway Patrol spokesman.
   Garrett said the animals were used for shows, promotions and
education.
   His store was fined $1,000 in June after Sampson, then a
7-month-old cub, knocked its cage open and bit a 6-year-old girl.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture alleged the store was negligent
in handling and housing the lions there.
   Garrett said he was moving the lions from the store to a 68-acre
ranch he owns in Purcell, where they are to be put on display
behind 12-foot fences.

   The $630 million home-away-from-home for
E.T., Ghostbusters, Jaws and King Kong made its official debut today
with dozens of Hollywood stars joining Steven Spielberg to ``ride
the movies'' at Universal Studios Florida.
   The combination theme park and film production center features
high-tech entertainment on a big scale _ showing visitors how movies
are made while letting them in on the action.
   James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Bill Cosby and Michael J. Fox
were among the 50 or so top names parading down a replica of
Hollywood Boulevard in limousines to open the festivities.
   Sidney Sheinberg, president of the park's co-owner, MCA Inc.,
today called the 444-acre site ``a swampland turned into a
dreamland.''
   But the park wasn't totally up and running. Technical glitches
prevented some of the major rides from operating at a special party
for some 4,500 delegates to a travel industry convention Wednesday
night.
   Sheinberg and studio technical officials said ``most everything
would be in operation'' today but that problems and delays were
expected because of the complexity of the equipment.
   The park, owned by California-based MCA and London's Rank
Organisation PLC, features classic movie-themed rides and
``participatory adventures,'' many of which were conceived and
designed by film director Spielberg, Universal's creative consultant.
   Visitors go soaring with E.T., the Extraterrestrial, survive the
1906 San Francisco earthquake, agonize over an encounter with the
great white shark from ``Jaws,'' get buffetted in an aerial tramway
by a 3-story-tall King Kong and lose themselves in the live-action
Ghostbusters haunting.
   Universal also has the largest movie and TV sound stage area
outside Hollywood, Calif. Production has been under way since 1988,
and 13 feature films and 500 television episodes are to go before
the cameras this year.
   Universal is also the new home to Nickelodeon, the children's
television network, and the first Hard Rock Cafe in Florida.
   MCA is trying to grab a share of Florida's booming theme-park
industry, a business dominated by entertainment giant Walt Disney
World.
   The Disney-MGM Studios, based on the same concept but about half
the size of Universal Studios, completed its first year of operation
May 1. It recorded about 8 million visits in its first year, but the
turnstile count inflates actual attendance.
   Universal has a daily capacity of more than 40,000 and expects to
draw at least 5 million visitors its first year.
   MCA Vice President Jay Stein, who headed designing and building
of the Florida park, said he was confident of its success in the
face of the formidable competition a few miles down the interstate.
   ``It's a must-see attraction ... I don't think we're going to
eclipse Disney overnight. But we are going to bring lots of new
business to the area, and lots of repeat business to the area,'' he
said.
   Stein, a tough-talking taskmaster who started in the mailroom at
MCA 30 years ago, and his boss, Sheinberg, have had a running feud
with Disney Chairman Michael Eisner for years.
   They claim Eisner copied their idea for a movie-theme park and
rushed to build the Disney-MGM Studios before Universal could get
its act together. Eisner and other Disney executives downplay any
talk of a rivalry and instead tout the benefits of competition.
   Universal Studios Florida is also an important test of whether
MCA and Rank can export the same concept to Europe and Japan.
   ``We think there's a terrific market out there'' for high-tech
theme parks, Stein says.
   An announcement is expected soon on a similar enterprise to be
built either near London or Paris. MCA also has announced plans for
a theme park in Japan in partnership with Nippon Steel.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: FROM AFRICAN PLAINS TO THE JUNGLE OF COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month we'll study a couple of new -- and excellent -- videos, one dealing 
with Africa, the other with Costa Rica. And while both deal with wildlife 
conservation, the Costa Rica video involves other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa" (two videos), Eco Ventures, 45 minutes each (1988). These two 
remarkable videos, produced by Megan Epler Wood and narrated by George 
Plimpton, will be of special interest to African safari planners and 
ecology-minded armchair travelers. Each video combines spectacular scenery with 
a detailed study of the animals found in parks along the Tanzania-Kenya border. 
</P>
<P>
The first tape opens with stunning views of the vast, 10,000-square-mile 
Serengeti Plain and a map showing the path of migration that the hundreds of 
thousands of zebra, wildebeest and gazelles make on their annual search for 
grasslands and water. According to the narration, it's an ecological cycle that 
has continued for 10 million years. 
</P>
<P>
The camera follows the trek and shows how the animals surmount the incredible 
hardships of their long journey, including the constant threat of predators -- 
hyenas, wild dogs and lions. 
</P>
<P>
You get contrasting, touching scenes of the family-oriented zebra grooming each 
other and the birth of a soon-doomed wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
The sound and sight of the thundering herd as it struggles across the swiftly 
flowing Mara River are a video highlight that Plimpton calls "one of the 
greatest wildlife spectacles on earth." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wood captures some poignant and amusing scenes of the six-ton elephants 
splashing and playing as they cool off in the mud holes of Amboseli National 
Park at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Elephant teen-agers are shown 
trunk-wrestling, and at an elephant family gathering, viewers watch seniors 
embracing each other as if greeting old friends. Other animals shown in the 
park include flamingoes, cape buffalo, wart hogs and ostriches. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a discussion between Plimpton and Russell Train, 
chairman of the World Wildlife Fund/The Conservation Foundation, on the threat 
from poachers to this one-great concentration of elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The second tape opens with film clips of an Osa and Martin Johnson safari of 
the 1920s, then concentrates on following the social structure and daily life 
of a pride of lions. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers follow the female as she stalks her prey, while the male spends his day 
lying around surveying his realm, and the cubs wrestle and explore. The pride 
survives in spite of the fact that, according to Plimpton, the female is a poor 
huntress, missing five out of six tries. There also are brief scenes of some of 
the other cats in the Masai Mara Game Reserve, including leopards and cheetahs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, producer Wood opens with early film from the movie "King Kong," 
comparing it with the gentle mountain gorillas found in the Virunga Mountains 
of Rwanda, where the late anthropologist Dian Fossey lived and died studying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The gorillas, which usually live at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, don't 
survive in captivity. Viewers will see the females flirting with the males, and 
the majestic silverback males protecting their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain gorillas are vegetarians, and scenes show them munching on the 
greenery and lolling in the sun, a favorite activity, while young ones stumble 
and frolic as they leave their mother to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Plimpton and Train conclude this segment with a discussion on preserving the 
mountain gorilla and the part that tourism plays in making the world aware of 
the nened for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are available from Eco Ventures, 2021 L. Street N.W., Suite 250, 
Washington, D.C. 20036. Call toll-free (800) 862-8900. Price: $29.95, or two 
for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Rica" (Megaview Productions International), 1988, 34 minutes. This is 
one of the few videos on Costa Rica, and it's remarkably good. For those who 
have been there, for those planning a trip or for those just curious, it's a 
worthwhile addition to a travel video collection. 
</P>
<P>
Against a montage of quick scenes showing some of the beauty and appeal of this 
Central American country -- lush green forests, rivers, volcanoes, gambling 
casinos and fishing -- the narrator gives viewers a bit of history as well as 
vital statistics on the high literacy rate, climate, number of bird species 
(850), national parks (26), which airlines fly there and an overview of the 
type of its hotels, facilities and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The major part of the video, however, takes viewers on a series of tours that 
cover the most popular tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
These include a tour of the capital, San Jose, showing scenes of the shopping 
district, central market place, national museum, national theater and 
restaurants. Side trips from San Jose include a visit to Sarchi and its ox-cart 
factory, where the colorful native souvenirs, as well as other crafts, are made 
and sold, and a visit to the enchanting Orosi Valley on the tumultuous 
Reventazon River for scenes of an exciting river rafting trip. This is followed 
by a tour to Tiquicia, "Tico" country, to a typical adobe farm-ranch restaurant 
to enjoy scenes of native food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Irazu volcano, topping 11,000 feet and from which you can see both the 
Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, is another tour destination, as is a visit to the 
rim of the awesome, still-active Poas volcano. At Cartago, at the foot of 
Irazu, viewers also see the Basilica de Los Angeles, where the La Negrita (the 
Black Virgin) statue is enshrined and to whom miracles have been attributed. 
</P>
<P>
A video highlight is the ride on the jungle train that connects Limon to San 
Jose, passing through coffee and banana plantations and small villages of the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
Other tours include a jungle adventure launch ride along the Colorado River and 
canals, with a stop at a lodge in the town of Colorado, and trips to the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest and the Carara Biological Reserve to view some of the 
many examples of the colorful and unusual plants, birds and animals being 
protected in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Nature lovers also will be rewarded with film and narration on the leatherback 
turtles seen laying their eggs on the beach. A final stop is at Lake Arenal, 
where fishermen are seen big-game fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the production was filmed in cooperation with the Swiss Travel 
Service, a tour company of Costa Rica, there are no blatant commercial plugs 
and no tie-ins with hotels or other tourist facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Megaview Productions, 255 N. El Cielo Road, Suite 155, 
Palm Springs, Calif. 92262, (619) 366-8464. Price: $25.

THE EPIC, AN ENDANGERED SPECIES;

THE WORLD ISN'T THE PLACE IT WAS WHEN OUR SCREEN HEROES WENT A-CONQUERING, BUT

David Lean, the recipient of this year's American Film Institute Lifetime 
Achievement Award, is the world's leading exemplar of the epic film maker. At 
82, he's preparing to direct an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's great, mad novel 
"Nostromo," and already the project is being talked about not only as Lean's 
Last Stand but, also, as the last great outpost of the epic adventure film. The 
lionization of Lean is both a tribute to the grandeur of his best work, like 
"Lawrence of Arabia," and a recognition that such grandeur has mostly vanished 
from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, a Lean-like movie recently opened, Bob Rafelson's "Mountains of 
the Moon," about Sir Richard Burton and the quest for the source of the Nile. 
It's an epic, all right, but a dull one. Still, those of us who love 
grand-scale spectacle may be willing to indulge the film for old time's sake. 
The form inspires, even if the movie doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Epic adventure movies have never been in large supply but, until the last 
several decades, they were a dependably tried-and-true staple. Films like "King 
Solomon's Mines," both the 1937 and 1950 versions, or the 1939 "Stanley and 
Livingstone" -- to name a few of my faves -- delivered uncomplicated 
storylines, stalwart heroes and lots of fervid junglescapes. As 
racial-historical tracts, they never rose much above the Call-Me-Bwana level, 
but that didn't seem to matter much. Except as fantasies, nobody took these 
films seriously anyway. They were the product of eras which could easily 
accommodate their Victorianized boys'-book reactionaryism. Heroism was defined 
as action, and action was most often expressed as the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
But all that was a while ago. In cultural terms, the comparatively "politically 
aware" eras that followed exposed the Great White Hunter trappings of these 
films and made their continuation in the same form untenable. The ways in which 
the white hunters were championed and the natives devalued was perceived as a 
noxious simplification -- an evasion of the true nature of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for the demise of the epic adventure film. For one, 
costs have become prohibitive, at least in theory. ("Mountains of the Moon" was 
financed for a relatively measly $18 million; Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" 
cost around $23 million.) Studios are still quite capable of coughing up kingly 
fortunes to finance their movies, but they tend to put their bucks into star 
salaries and hardware. Making a movie involving oodles of extras and far-off 
locations, with period sets and costumes, is not the sort of expedition that 
Hollywood's Great White Studio Heads are particularly willing to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Movies of exploration are also regarded as antiquated in the modern era. What 
is there left to discover? Territorial exploration has moved beyond earthly 
borders. Outer space is the new uncharted jungle -- just substitute hostile 
aliens (usually "dark") for hostile natives. In such a play-act universe, 
heroes and villains can act out the same old reactionary scenarios without 
rankling any real-world political sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
The never-never-land settings also make it possible to portray, often 
tongue-in-cheek, the kind of straight-arrow, unambiguous heroes who can no 
longer be comfortably depicted in American movies in the post-Vietnam phase. 
Vietnam altered the portrayal of heroism in American movies by calling into 
question the country's motivations for foreign expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the American as the square-jawed avenger of injustice was turned 
on its head; in counterculture terms, what once was regarded as heroism was 
converted into a species of villainy. The use of force carried tragic 
consequences. The new hero who emerged from this smoking debris turned out to 
be the man who valued his ability to run away from danger. He wasn't John 
Wayne. He was Woody Allen and Richard Pryor. This has changed somewhat. 
Currently, the new product line of American movie hero is the one who voyages 
inward. Victories are not territorial but emotional, and small-scale -- they're 
about learning how to read, how to love again. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past few decades, the adventure epic, when it hasn't transferred to 
outer space, has been almost exclusively spoofy. From the "Indiana Jones" cycle 
on down to "Romancing the Stone" and "Sheena, Queen of the Jungle," these epics 
buy off their antique ooga-booga ideologies by turning the whole expeditionary 
enterprise into a joke. They bring to the fore the absurdities that were always 
lurking just below the stalwart surface of the genre. It's understandable that 
a director like Steven Spielberg, who by his own admission was in strong 
measure formed as a film maker watching such movies as "Lawrence of Arabia," 
would feel drawn to the epic form; or that, given his essentially 
kicky-adolescent world view, he would instinctively lampoon the form as a way 
of making it his own. But even the best of these adventure spoofs are somewhat 
disappointing -- weightless. There isn't much that's awesome in the movies 
anymore, and so it's disconcerting to see awe-inspiring feats in majestic 
landscapes reduced to rinky-dink high jinks. 
</P>
<P>
When epic adventures aren't being spoofy, they are often being revisionist. In 
movies like "Greystoke" and "The Mission," the form is used as an ideological 
chalkboard. The pure pleasures of epic panorama are subverted to the "message," 
which is often bulky and overweening: the Nature of Man, the Nature of 
Imperialism, and so on. There's nothing illicit about using a king-size canvas 
to push a personal agenda -- D.W. Griffith did it -- but too many of the 
agendas are as bloated as their movie's budgets. Movies are an inadequate 
medium for conveying complex sociopolitical arguments; they're much better at 
sensation and immediacy, and the epic form only tends to emphasize the 
inadequacy. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the epic-adventure film is, of course, all-of-a-piece with the 
demise of the epic film in general. The epic survives in its purest form not on 
the big screen but on the small, as miniseries. Films with subjects of epic 
historical scope like, say, "Roots" or "The Thorn Birds" or "Lonesome Dove," 
are now almost strictly the province of television. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that the movie business, which reacted to the threat of television 
in the '50s by scaling things big and high and wide, should now have turned 
tail and relinquished the epic to the airwaves. An entire generation of young 
viewers has grown up with a distorted idea of the epic film, because the epics 
they watch are all housed in a small box, where most of the qualities that made 
them worth watching are eliminated. Many of the movie theaters in the 
multiplexes are small boxes too. Is it any wonder film makers are so reluctant 
to embark on epic projects? 
</P>
<P>
It may only be a matter of time before television also disposes of the epic 
form. The disappointing ratings for a humongous series like "War and 
Remembrance" was taken as an object lesson by the networks; it's doubtful that, 
in the current climate, even a "Lonesome Dove" could be made again. The 
sound-bite ethos of television has taken its toll on the national attention 
span and cramped the medium's ability to convey the significance of monumental 
events. Television is being employed without a sense of historical moment; you 
would never know from watching most news shows that we are in the middle of one 
of greatest global political shifts in the 20th Century. The epic movie is 
predicated on a sense of narrative history, and that sense is increasingly 
absent from mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that good epics, exploration-adventure or otherwise, still 
can't, or shouldn't be made. It's a mistake to assume that these movies have to 
cost zillions, or that they should only respond to the four-square conservatism 
of the times by mythologizing four-square conservative heroes. Epics can 
embrace diverse mythologies -- it all depends who's doing the mythologizing. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a mistake to discount old-fashioned "King Solomon's Mines"-type 
squareness. Square doesn't necessarily have to be reactionary; it can be 
beautiful too. The impulse to create comprehensible heroes who live on in some 
protected precinct of our childhoods is not to be belittled. Probably the best 
epic adventure movie of the past 15 years, John Huston's "The Man Who Would Be 
King," was frankly and unapologetically an outsider's vision, with no attempt 
to "modernize" its view of the natives. On the other side, "Lawrence of Arabia" 
demonstrated that the epic adventure could accommodate a hero who was, at 
bottom, incomprehensible. Lean's stately craftsmanship set off T.E. Lawrence's 
depth-charged psychological ambiguities, and that's what made the film seem so 
traditional and yet so modern. 
</P>
<P>
The epic form is alive as long as there are writers and directors with epic 
imaginations, and actors who can embody their visions. And there are, there 
are. We're surrounded by directors (Roger Spottiswoode, Geoff Murphy, and Fred 
Schepisi, for starters) and actors (Nick Nolte, Judy Davis, Denzel Washington, 
Aidan Quinn immediately come to mind) who carry around even in their 
small-scale work an epic purchase on history. They're poised for heroic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Epic movies aren't some lumbering offshoot of the medium. Their sheer bigness 
is basic to the medium, as basic as the quality of stardom. If you were born 
before the '60s, chances are that the movies that first opened your eyes were 
the swashbuckling spectacles. They may not always have been very good, but they 
suggested reaches of adventure and heroism and history that made moviegoing the 
most exciting of romances. It's high time to renew the romance. 
</P>
<P>
I can't wait for "Nostromo."

   From King Kong's banana breath to E.T. From
Jaws to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
   Universal Studios is arriving in Orlando like gangbusters to
compete with the oldest established entertainment show in town.
   The $600 million Universal Studios Florida, based on some of
Hollywood's great movies, goes public in May, exactly a year after
the Disney-MGM Studios theme park opened for business a few miles
down the road.
   ``Come to Universal and ride the movies,'' says Steven
Spielberg, the bearded movie genius acting as creative consultant
for the 440-acre attraction.
   Company executives speak in terms of waging war against Walt
Disney World for the hearts, minds and pocketbooks of the millions
of tourists who will be dividing their attention between the
competing studio theme parks.
   ``I think they're very vulnerable,'' says Jay Stein, an MCA vice
president, about the Disney-MGM Studios.
   ``It IS a little like war. It means that when you invade you
make damn sure that your army is big enough and strong enough to
win.''
   The Florida attraction is a bigger, modernized version of
Universal's studio tour in California and is owned jointly by MCA
Inc. and the Rank Organization of London. Stein is president of the
division that created and built the park, MCA Recreation Services.
   Company officials say the key differences between their park and
Disney's is Universal's more sophisticated technology and its
``full-fledged involvement of the customer'' in each of the 15
attractions. They speak of ``super-realistic technology'' providing
``wrap-around experiences'' for young and old.
   In a blunt attack on the competition, Stein said in a recent
interview that ``what the Disney-MGM Studios are offering their
guests is approximately one-third of what we're offering. ...
Across the board, we're going to deliver a more impressive
entertainment experience.''
   Stein acknowledged, however, that the Disney organization was
``a strong, well-financed company with a marketing potential that
is intimidating at worst.''
   Because of that, he said, Universal ``needs to create and
deliver an entertainment experience that is so different and
superior that we can assure ourselves that we're going to capture
enough segments of the market to make this thing profitable.''
   Stein and MCA President Sid Sheinberg have for years disputed
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner's claims that the Disney-MGM Studios
theme park is the realization of Walt Disney's ideas from 50 years
ago.
   Stein and Sheinberg contend that Disney copied the concept from
Universal's Studio Tour, which has been in operation in the
Hollywood area since 1964, and that Eisner rushed into construction
to beat Universal into Florida.
   Eisner and other Disney officials usually soft-pedal the
criticism and the rivalry, insisting that the competition is good
for each other as well as Florida.
   Besides the theme park attractions, Universal Studios Florida
has the largest movie and television production area outside
Hollywood. It has three times the amount of sound-stage space that
Disney has.
   Production has been under way since 1988.
   Scheduled to go before the cameras this year, studio executives
say, are 13 feature films and 500 television episodes.
   The back lot tour includes 50 locations, including famed
Hollywood Boulevard, a New England Village, the San Francisco Wharf
and New York's Penn Station. There are 40 restaurants and snack
shops, including Schwab's Drug Store, the Studio Commissary and
Mel's Diner from ``American Graffiti.''
   Also a part of the complex will be the first Hard Rock Cafe in
Florida.
   With Universal's long tradition of blending public participation
and filmmaking, the Florida park encourages superlatives:
   _ ``Kongfrontation'' pits a skyway tram containing 50 people
against the 37-foot tall, computer-animated gorilla in what is
billed as the largest sound stage in the world. King Kong will be
so real that visitors will be able to smell his banana breath. The
six-story King Kong building has 50 facades modeled after midtown
Manhattan.
   _ In ``Jaws,'' a 24-foot-long, computerized shark weighing three
tons crunches its jaws onto a 40-passenger boat on 7-acre Amity
Bay, rocking the craft in both directions before the shark is
``killed.''
   _ A subway train carrying 200 guests into a San Francisco
station is buffetted by an ``earthquake,'' a re-creation of the
1906 San Francisco temblor that measured 8.3 on the Richter scale.
Trains crash into each other, the overhead roadway comes tumbling
down and 60,000 gallons of water flood the scene.
   _ ``Ghostbusters'' is a re-creation of the largest set ever
built on a Hollywood sound stage: eight-stories high. The action is
a special effects thriller, with 13 larger-than-life mechanical
ghosts getting zapped by Neutrana Wand beams until their
ectoplasmic energy explodes.
   _ Spielberg's pet project, ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' is a
soaring, obstacle-filled adventure on a dirt bike. It starts with a
chase through a forest and takes the visitor all the way to E.T.'s
home, the Green Planet.
   The movie-themed rides and participatory attractions include a
high-speed chase inside the world of Hanna-Barbera cartoons, a
``Phantom of the Opera'' horror make-up show and visitor input into
Alfred Hitchcock's stylized thrillers.
   And so it goes, one ``funtastic'' happening after another in the
park that officials say will take visitors two days to cover fully.
   Universal plans a ``soft opening'' in early May. The official
grand opening is June 7, with Spielberg and a collection of
Hollywood stars presiding.
   Spielberg, who dreamed up ``E.T.,'' ``Jaws'' and other film
fantasies, calls his job as creative consultant a storyteller's
dream come true.
   ``We've made the movie experience something that fans can see,
feel, touch and smell,'' he says.
   The park's most ambitious undertaking, ``Back to the Future,''
will not be ready for the park's opening.
   It will have two adjacent theaters, each measuring 80 feet in
diameter, and use projected images along with complex motion
simulators topped with Delorean automobiles. Visitors will ride 12
of the cars in each dome as they go crashing through the centuries
with the mad scientist Doc Brown.
   Because of the complex technology, it is taking longer to build
than originally contemplated, said its inventor, Peter Alexander,
vice president of shows and rides for MCA's Recreational Services
Group.
   ``It's probably the most responsive and complex motion simulator
ever built,'' said Alexander.
   Nickelodeon, the TV network for kids, celebrated its 10th
birthday in March by beginning construction of a new home at the
Orlando park.
   The Nickelodeon production complex will consist of two sound
stages and an interactive entertainment area for children. It will
produce shows here throughout the year, and visitors to the park
will be able to audition for shows as well as to view production,
video, audio and control room operations.
   Universal expects to draw at least 5 million people in its first
year, and Stein and other officials say those who see will become
``instant converts'' passing the word on to others.
   ``We're going to be the new kid on the block, and people are
going to give us a try,'' he said. ``And we're going to deliver.''

<HEAD>MGM Grand to Build Movie Theme Park in Las Vegas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

   MGM Grand Inc. said Tuesday it will
spend $700 million to convert a Las Vegas golf course into a movie
theme park and a 5,000-room hotel-casino, gambling on luring
families to ``the best mouse trap in town.''
   ``I remember the days when Las Vegas lived almost entirely on
the high roller,'' MGM Grand chairman Fred Benninger said at a news
conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ``You can't do that
anymore.''
   The site is on the Las Vegas Strip location where the Tropicana
Country Club and Marina Hotel and Casino now stand. Benninger
wouldn't reveal how much MGM Grand paid for those properties.
   Other details were sketchy as well, although conceptual drawings
showed towering spires and domes, like a futuristic version of
Sleeping Beauty's Castle at Disneyland.
   MGM Grand, owned by Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk Kerkorian,
said last month it might build the theme park on a 60-acre site
beside the Desert Inn, which it owns and is promoting as a top-end
hotel-casino.
   The new theme park site, at 115 acres, is nearly twice as large.
Benninger said finding enough space was a more important
consideration than money.
   The new MGM Grand Hotel and theme park are tentatively expected
to open by late 1992.
   Benninger said he was confident the complex, with hotel rooms
costing about $40 a night, would cash in on the trend toward family
tourism in Las Vegas that began with the opening of Circus Circus a
decade ago.
   Las Vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year, up
from 11 million in 1980. Its population has boomed from 300,000
eight years ago to more than 700,000.
   Las Vegas officials have said for years that the city needed a
major theme park to help attract families. A water theme park,
built on the Las Vegas Strip five years ago, has been extremely
successful.
   ``Clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for
quite a while,'' said Harold Vogel, veteran entertainment analyst
for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``It's an adult resort, and now they're
going to extend it so the rest of the family members can enjoy it
too.''
   Benninger said movie themes had proved an enduring lure to
tourists, as proved by expansions of Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc.'s
Universal Studios into Florida movie theme parks.
   ``There has always been competition in Las Vegas,'' Benninger
said. ``I'm not worried about competition. We're building the best
mouse trap in town.''
   Benninger said MGM Grand will add 4,300 rooms to the 700-room
Marina at a cost of about $250 million. The theme park, which will
cost about $450 million, will include a working film and television
studio, although he said it might have just one sound stage.
   It is anticipated that the complex will employ 7,000 workers.
   Other details were sketchy. A name for the complex, and even its
designers, have yet to be selected. Benninger wouldn't reveal
details about the attractions being considered, although he said
there were many.
   He said ``two or three organizations'' had approached him about
possible partnerships and left open the possibility of finding
another partner.
   Benninger said MGM Grand regarded the development as a prototype
and had already received calls from unidentified organizations
about developing similar complexes elsewhere.
   MGM Grand, a separate company from MGM-UA Communications Corp.,
owns an all-frills Los Angeles-New York airline as well as the
Desert Inn. It also retains rights to a stylized version of the
famous MGM lion.
   Kerkorian, 72, had sold and bought back bits and pieces of
MGM-UA Communications for two decades, a period during which he
also traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars.
   Then last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase
MGM-UA _ including the original lion logo _ for $1.5 billion,
outbidding media mogul Rupert Murdoch by $100 million.
   A fire at the original MGM Grand Hotel, which Kerkorian built in
1973, killed 84 people in 1980. In 1985, Kerkorian sold the hotel
and its sister hotel in Reno to Bally Manufacturing Co. of Chicago
for nearly $500 million.

THE SAINT OF HEDONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was once in the south of India a hedonistic king who valued his pleasures 
and his treasures above all things. However, this king also enjoyed intelligent 
conversation, and from time to time visitors were invited into the royal 
chamber, where he reclined on his lion throne, dressed in the most sumptuous of 
garments. 
</P>
<P>
One day, a wise yogin came to the court and was granted an audience. When the 
king saw his tattered clothing and weathered face, he was filled with pity. 
</P>
<P>
"What a terrible life you must lead, wandering from country to country in such 
a miserable state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to complain about," the yogin replied. "You are the one to be 
pitied." 
</P>
<P>
"What makes you think such a thing?" said the king, taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"I have eyes," said the yogin. "I can see that you live in constant dread of 
your own subjects. Above all, you fear the loss of your throne. But I, I am 
free from all suffering. The pain of old age, even death itself, is unknown to 
me. Were I to leap into a roaring fire, I would not be burned. Were I to 
swallow the deadliest of poisons, I would not die." 
</P>
<P>
"How can this be?" asked the king, amazed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned the great teachings of the alchemists," replied the venerable 
yogin. "I possess the secret of immortality." 
</P>
<P>
The words of the yogin affected the king so profoundly that his faith was 
kindled on the spot. "I am unable to wander from place to place as you do," he 
said, "but if you could teach me how to meditate while remaining here on my 
throne in my palace I would be very grateful. I beg you to remain long enough 
to instruct me," and he prostrated himself in humble supplication. 
</P>
<P>
The yogin granted the king's request by initiating him into the meditative 
practices of the deity Hevajra. The king learned to concentrate his attention 
unwaveringly upon the jeweled ring on his right hand. In time, he was able to 
visualize within the heart of the jewel the great Hevajra himself seated amid 
his retinue of divinities. When the king succeeded in transfixing this vision 
he united both the creative and fulfillment modes of meditation and the state 
of realization, the one-pointed trance of samadhi, spontaneously unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter the king meditated ceaselessly. The dawning of his understanding had 
endowed him with the power and realization of mahamudra as well as other 
abilities, such as extrasensory perception. Yet he accomplished all this while 
seated upon his lion throne reclining on cushions of silk surrounded by his 
queens and ministers and entertained by the court musicians. 
</P>
<P>
His fondness for sensual pleasures soon earned him the name Lilapa, which means 
"Master of Play." Nevertheless, he became known throughout the world for 
wonderful acts of selflessness, and in the end gained the ultimate liberation 
of entering the Paradise of the Dakinis. 
</P>
<P>
Lilapa's story shows us that when the karmic leanings and aspirations of the 
disciple blend harmoniously with the teachings of the guru, there is no need to 
renounce the pleasures of this life in order to attain liberation.

<TEXT>     It's Oxton Kennels and Exotics Wild Things, where there are enough animals
to stock a small zoo -- including a 500-pound lion, a 600-pound tiger, a
250-pound black bear, a baboon, monkeys, birds of prey, snakes and alligators.
There's also Clyde, a 7-foot dromedary camel.;    The kennel is owned by
Charlie Sammut, who grew up in Salinas loving animals. With the help of
Christy Ingram, Sammut trains wild animals for work in motion pictures,
television programs, ads and photo sessions.;    So far, the biggest star is
Josef the lion. He has just returned from making a video with Michael Jackson,
stars as the new MGM lion, and is on a television commercial for Dreyfus Corp.
and in the Dreyfus brochures.;     But he is not the only star. Brandi, the
2-year-old black bear, has appeared in a commercial for Renault cars and was
the poster bear for the recent nature movie "The Bear." Puff, Oxton's
six-foot-long monitor lizard, had a cameo role in the movie "Bird on a Wire.";
   Ingram, 33, has worked as Oxton's trainer for about four years and knows
the animals by name and personality.;    A lion who loves people;    Josef the
lion "loves people," Ingram says. "If he can't get up and greet someone new,
he gets real bored.";    Brandi the bear is "extremely intelligent" and can
learn tricks in just a few minutes.;    But Tug, the Bengal/Siberian tiger, is
a flop.;    "He didn't turn out right," Ingram says. "He has mental problems.
He gets grumpy and he can't think.";    Oxton uses Tug only for still
photography, and only under close supervision.;    As a child, Sammut's pet
collection consisted of "pythons, birds and boas" until he went to college and
ended up with a cougar "nobody wanted." Gradually Sammut's love for animals
led to the menagerie that is Oxton Kennels.;    "It's just an exotic pet
collection that got out of hand," says Sammut, 30.;    Intuition, respect;   
Ingram, who has been a trainer for about 10 years, has an intuition -- and
respect -- for the creatures she handles.;    "The thing about working with
the animals is that you have to get into their brains," Ingram says. "When you
have a lion or a tiger, full-grown, on a lead, you've got something that can
kill at the end of that leash.;    "When you're walking them, you have to
watch ahead of them and always think ahead of them so if something happens --
like a small animal coming out of the bushes -- you can see it before they do
and react to it.";    All the Oxton animals were born in captivity, many in
breeding programs such as the one at West Coast Gamepark in Oregon. Oxton
tries to obtain animals as babies because they are easier to train.;    Close
attention;  Sammut stresses that these animals are not pets, and require
constant attention.;    "We're with them all day, every day, and without that
attention they would turn wild," he says.;    Once at Oxton, the young animals
receive lots of handling -- by as many different people as possible. Ingram
runs a volunteer program for interested adults, and those who stick with the
job through unpleasant tasks such as cage-cleaning end up taking the babies
out for what their trainer describes as "quality time.";    "You can't just
take an animal out of its cage and strictly work it and put it back," Ingram
says. "You've got to sit with it and take it out for about an hour.";   
Training with wheelbarrows;    That's why Kali, a new tiger cub, might go out
to lunch with Ingram and Sammut, travel in cars, and ride in a wheelbarrow to
get used to motion.;    Then the training begins in earnest.;    Ingram first
teaches the animals to come to the sound of a buzzer so they can always be
tracked down while wandering around on a film set. Food is the reward, and
Oxton animals go through plenty of it -- 30 pounds of meat a day for the
carnivores alone.;    Next, the animals learn to go to a designated spot --
called a "mark" in movie lingo -- so they won't have to be led in front of
cameras. The rest of the training depends on the animal and the particular
movie or film, but Ingram generally teaches each animal to do certain
"natural" behaviors on cue. A bear, for example, might be taught to rear on
its hind legs or put its paws around a tree.;    Ingram says there are times
when even the animals she hand- rears challenge her -- just as they would
challenge their dominant leader in the wild. When that happens, Ingram says,
she stands her ground, even when the animal is twice her size.;    "You just
get bigger and louder than they are," she says. "It's all psychological. A lot
of (trainers) are into physical power and they use it too much to discipline.;
   "Never let an animal know how strong you really are."; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED;  Oxton, which will take some animals to classrooms, offers private
one-hour tours of the kennels for $5 per person. Appointments are necessary.

   Jack Haley Jr. was only 5, but he has a vivid
memory of his visit to the set of ``The Wizard of Oz'' in 1939.
   ``The colors, that's what I remember _ the most impressive,
incredible color I've ever seen. They must had every klieg light in
Hollywood on that set,'' he said.
   ``And, of course, I remember the Munchkins. I thought they lived
right there on that movie set. I knew they were adults because some
of them had mustaches and beards. But I thought they were little
people who lived in those little huts.''
   Haley has lived with ``The Wizard of Oz'' most of his life. The
aura of playing the Tin Woodman never left his father, Jack Haley.
And now, for the golden anniversary of the movie classic, Haley is
preparing a film history of the production, which will appear on
CBS next spring, prior to the network's 23rd airing of the film.
The movie also appeared on NBC eight times.
   The television special is part of a mammoth celebration of the
50th anniversary of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' The festivities include
an army of tap dancers in New York's Herald Square as part of a
Macy's department store promotion Aug. 13; screenings of a
mint-condition print at New York's Museum of Modern Art Aug. 14-15;
release of the movie in home video with a postscript of newly-found
film and photos; a merchandising campaign.
   All of this is being directed by the Turner Broadcasting System
which owns the rights to ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' has a long history in cinema. The author of
the Oz books, Lyman Frank Baum (1856-1919) made silent movies with
the characters from 1914 to 1917. He started the Oz Film
Manufacturing Co. in 1914, turning out shorts as well as
feature-length movies. They were fairly successful, but
distribution problems and his own failing health caused him to
close down the company.
   Samuel Goldwyn purchased the rights to the Oz books in 1932 for
$40,000 but made no films. When Walt Disney's ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs'' proved a smash in 1937, studios hunted for
children's classics. Louis B. Mayer bought the rights for MGM for
$75,000.
   Mervyn Leroy, who had directed such hard-hitting films as ``I Am
a Fugitive From a Chain Gang'' and ``Little Caesar,'' was a curious
choice to produce ``The Wizard of Oz.'' He assigned writer after
writer in an attempt to fashion a script. E.Y. (Yip) Harburg and
Harold Arlen were assigned to write the songs.
   Because of the large budget, MGM wanted Shirley Temple,
Hollywood's No. 1 moneymaker, to give the film box-office
insurance. Darryl Zanuck refused to release 20th Century-Fox's most
valuable asset. Judy Garland was taken out of B pictures to star as
Dorothy.
   Leroy originally wanted Ray Bolger to play the Tin Woodman.
``I'm not a tin performer, I'm fluid,'' he argued, seeking the
Scarecrow instead. He won his case, and the Woodman befell Buddy
Ebsen.
   Ed Wynn and W.C. Fields both declined the role of the Wizard,
according to ``The Making of `The Wizard of Oz''' by Aljean
Harmetz. The part was given to Frank Morgan, who like Ebsen and
Bolger was an MGM contract player. Bert Lahr came from Broadway to
play the Cowardly Lion.
   Richard Thorpe started directing the film on Oct. 12, 1938.
After 12 days he was fired because his work lacked a sense of
fantasy. Victor Fleming took over the direction, but he left before
finishing the black-and-white sequences. He was needed to replace
George Cukor on ``Gone With the Wind.''
   King Vidor finished directing ``The Wizard of Oz,'' including
the ``Over the Rainbow'' number. But Fleming received film credit.
   Then came another substitution. The aluminum paint poisoned
Buddy Ebsen, and Jack Haley assumed the role.

   ``The Wizard of Oz'' was completed on March 16, 1939. The final
budget was $2,777,000, a huge amount for those times. MGM launched
a big promotion campaign in hopes of recouping the investment.
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' premiered at the Grauman's Chinese theater
on Aug. 15, 1939. The New York opening followed two nights later at
the ``air-conditioned'' Capitol theater on Broadway.
   The reviews were mixed. The New York Times' Frank Nugent
declared: ``It is so well intentioned, so genial, and so gay than
any reviewer who would look down his nose at the fun-making should
be spanked and sent off, supperless, to bed.''
   A number of critics qualified for such treatment. The New Yorker
called ``The Wizard of Oz'' a ``stinkeroo'' which ``displays no
trace of imagination, good taste or ingenuity.''
   The New Republic's Otis Ferguson had unkind words for Judy
Garland: ``It isn't that this little slip of a miss spoils the
fantasy so much as that her thumping, overgrown gambols are
characteristic of its treatment here. When she is merry, the house
shakes, and everybody gets wet when she is forlorn.''
   Theater returns were good at first, then fell off. ``The Wizard
of Oz'' grossed $3,017,000 for the studio, causing a huge loss. A
re-release in 1948-49 brought in $1.5 million, enough to turn a
bare profit.
   ``The Wizard'' would have sunk into the limbo of failed movies
except for television. In 1956, CBS was eager to broadcast ``Gone
With the Wind,'' but MGM refused to part with its biggest
moneymaker.
   A CBS executive suggested ``The Wizard of Oz.'' The deal was
struck for one screening at $225,000, with an option for seven more
at $150,000 apiece. The film was shown on Nov. 3, 1956, and drew a
huge rating. Later runs did even better. More Americans have seen
``The Wizard of Oz'' than any other movie, and that record is
likely to continue into the 21st century.
   Meanwhile, MGM-UA plans to launch a seven-story hot air balloon
on Aug. 19, and fly it from Hollywood to Kansas to send Dorothy
home.
   According to a press release: ``We are planning an exciting day
full of special events to send Dorothy off in style.''

<HL> Movie Makers Hope Long Summer
Is Hot With Sequels and Comedies

   Amid general optimism about the summer season, the movie industry is buzzing with two big questions: Will Paramount Pictures rake in even more at the box office with "Beverly Hills Cop II" than with the original? 
And will Columbia Pictures be raked over the coals with the costly "Ishtar"? 

   Summer, which typically provides 40% of the industry's annual take at the box office, is long this year, with Memorial Day a week earlier than usual and Labor Day a week later. 
And just one or two blockbusters during the season could help to push 1987's receipts ahead of 1984's record $4.03 billion, according to A.D. Murphy, who tracks box-office results for the industry publication Variety. 

   "To set a new annual record," Mr. Murphy says, "we only need to be $250 million ahead of last year," when box-office receipts totaled $3.8 billion. 
He notes that the first 17 weeks of this year were $150 million ahead of the same period last year. 

   "The box office has been good for four or five months," adds Terry Semel, president of Warner Communications Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit. 
"On paper, at least, it looks like it's going to be a big summer." 

   Theater owners are optimistic, too. 
Ronald Leslie, who heads AMC Entertainment Inc., one of the nation's largest theater chains, expects at least 10 films to be big hits and three or four to be blockbusters. 
"This may be the best summer in 20 years," he says. 
"We sure need it." 

   Some studios really need it, too. 
Many of the season's movies will have to draw large audiences to cover costs, let alone make a profit. 
"There are a lot of very big expensive films this year," says Philip Garfinkle, senior vice president of Entertainment Data Inc. Mr. Garfinkle, whose company analyzes box-office data, adds that in each of the past three summers only nine pictures -- out of some 40 to 50 a season -- had revenues of over $40 million, thus qualifying as hits. (About 60 movies are scheduled for release this summer.) 

   The riskiest big-budget picture, most industry executives agree, is "Ishtar," which stars Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman as failed musicians who get caught up in shenanigans and intrigue in Morocco. 
The film, opening tomorrow, was initially scheduled for release last Christmas but was late and over budget. 
Although Columbia, a unit of Coca-Cola Co., hasn't confirmed the figures, industry executives estimate that the movie cost more than $40 million to produce and expect an additional $10 million will be spent on distribution and marketing. 

   The movie has attracted a lot of press, mostly for its huge budget (an average movie nowadays costs about $15 million). 
It may do well, gauging by the moderately favorable reviews it has already received in the major newsweeklies, where critics have tended to be deferential toward its big stars. 
Newsweek, for example, rated it "the kind of movie you smile at a lot and leave thinking, hey, that was a pleasant $5 worth of fun." 

   But a lot of $5 bills will have to change hands to make "Ishtar" a success. 
Industry executives say it will have to bring in more than $150 million just to break even. 

   The producers of "Beverly Hills Cop II," Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, also spent plenty on their movie-about $30 million. 
But industry executives say it is virtually sure to be a blockbuster. 
The first "Beverly Hills Cop," which introduced Eddie Murphy as a wiseacre Detroit street cop transplanted to Beverly Hills, cost $15 million and grossed more than $237 million in the U.S. alone. 
If Paramount, a unit of Gulf &amp; Western Inc., has another hit in a movie version of the classic television series "The Untouchables" -- as many exhibitors expect -- the company could walk away with the lion's share of the box office this summer. 

   There are other sequels to chose from as well, including Warner Bros.' 
"Superman IV"; MGM/UA Communications Co.'s "The Living Daylights," a James Bond movie featuring Timothy Dalton as the latest 007; and "Revenge of the Nerds II" from News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. 
For fans of the canine star of "Benji," Walt Disney Co. is bringing him back in "Benji the Hunted." 

   MCA Inc.'s Universal Pictures had planned to release "Jaws III" in early July. 
But Tom Pollock, the studio's head, acknowledges that the mechanical shark has been giving the studio some problems. 
He now expects to release the film before the summer's end. 

   In the meantime, Universal has high hopes for two other films. 
Like Paramount, Universal plans to release a movie based on an old television series -- a comedy treatment of "Dragnet" starring Dan Aykroyd. 
The other offering, "Harry and the Hendersons," is a fantasy adventure about a mythical beast adopted by a vacationing family. 
Produced under the aegis of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, "Harry" opens June 5. 

   The picture Mr. Spielberg is most closely associated with this summer, Warner Bros.' 
"Innerspace," updates a concept that worked years ago in "Fantastic Voyage": A test pilot is miniaturized and injected into another person's body. 
Warner is also counting on appealing to a wide range of audiences with "Full Metal Jacket," a Vietnam drama directed by veteran Stanley Kubrick; "The Lost Boys," a teen-oriented flick about adolescent vampires; and an adaptation of the John Updike novel "The Witches of Eastwick," starring Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfieffer as modern-day witches, and Jack Nicholson as the devil. 

   In addition to such big-budget pictures as "Beverly Hills Cop II," exhibitors are betting on a number of more modest films. 
Among the comedies are Tri-Star Pictures Inc.'s "Nadine," starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger; Disney's "Adventures in Babysitting" and "Ernest Goes to Camp"; and MGM/UA's "Spaceballs," a science-fiction spoof produced by the comedian Mel Brooks. 
Paramount's "Back to the Beach" marks the return of Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. 

   Exhibitors are also hopeful about two action-adventure movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger: Tri-Star's "The Running Man" and Fox's "Predator." 

   Besides "Ishtar," Columbia is releasing "Roxanne," with Steve Martin as a contemporary Cyrano De Bergerac, and "La Bamba," about the life of singer Richie Valens. 
In an unusual move, the studio plans to release the latter in both English and Spanish to draw Hispanic audiences. 

   Among the few wide-release children's movies this summer is Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s "The Chipmunk Adventure," which stars the animated cartoon creatures in their film debut and opens May 22. 
On July 7, Disney will re-release the animated classic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 

   Perhaps the most unusual promotion of the season is that for De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc.'s "The Million Dollar Mystery." 
Moviegoers get to solve the mystery of where $1 million is hidden in the movie -- and one lucky viewer will actually win the money.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Inspired by organised chaos - Venice Film Festival /
Nigel Andrews thoroughly enjoys the inspired madness embodied in this week's
on-screen offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Venice Film Festival has reached an alarming stage. Instead of feeling
as we critics should during these events - like hardworking martyrs to art
with subtitles permanently dancing before our eyes - we have been enjoying
almost every new movie.
From the latest Woody Allen comedy Bullets Over Broadway we jaunt over to a
midnight Harrison Ford romp, Clear And Present Danger. From a jolly Spanish
film about love and acrobatics, The Tit And The Moon, we proceed to a
nailbiting, inspired Danish TV series about a haunted hospital, The Kingdom,
before skipping over to Heavenly Creatures, a truth-based New Zealand black
comedy about two schoolgirls who murder for their friendship.
Jury president David Lynch was seen leaving this last in a glow of
approbation, so the Golden Lion may reach a long paw into the Antipodes next
Monday. Heavenly Creatures was co-written and directed by Peter Jackson,
best known for spoof splatter films like Brain Dead. Here he has held back
on the flying intestines but not the sense of camp hyperbole.
This 1950s Christchurch is awash with picket-fence prettiness and twittering
moral decency - Lynch territory par excellence - as Pauline (Melanie
Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) form their fantasy-filled friendship.
This is fed by their own tales of castles and kings, and served by Jackson's
blithe camera arabesques and transformation scenes. Gasp at the Sound Of
Music-style helicopter shot of Juliet running over a hill; gasp again when
that landscape is metamorphosed into a lush palace garden. Unicorns,
fountains, butterflies large as hang-gliders ..
It all ends in blood and tears, as the two girls' parents, who condemn the
friendship as 'unhealthy' and 'unwholesome', predict it will. But for the
audience, what a movie ride before we hit the buffers.
The only other Venice movie on this scale of robust postmodernism - witty
exaggeration built into the po-faced melodrama - was Lars Von Trier's The
Kingdom.
This is not a movie at all but more a four-part, 4 1/2 -then-two-hour TV
series, shot with a handheld camera in poverty-row monochrome. But it proves
the Danish director of acclaimed style-pieces The Element Of Crime and
Europa can turn on the magic without tricksy optical effects.
In this Lynch-lore festival you could call The Kingdom 'Twin Peaks in a
hospital': teasingly quotidian setting; weirder and weirder characters;
emergency outbreaks of non-sequitur; the apocalypse of ghosts and guilty
secrets.
But Trier and Niels Vorsel's script has a start-to-finish logic that Peaks
never quite had. Its perfectly meshed characters - the sarcastic Swedish
neuro-consultant, the solemnly deranged anatomy lecturer, the
hypochondriacal old lady who hears 'voices' in the lift shaft - give the
story a strong, even Ibsenite, vertebra, while the wacky toll of severed
heads, masonic rituals and self-destruct surgery provides the gymnastic
freedom of narrative.
In the vain quest for a dud film at this festival we critics tried
everything. A Woody Allen film without Woody? That might be a trial. But no
 -it was Bullets Over Broadway, a sparkling comedy of theatre manners, with
gangsters, gags and the funniest not-by-Woody performance in the entire
Allen cannon. This was Dianne Wiest's vainglorious actress: sighing,
soaring, scatterbrained, Gloria Swanson crossed with Margaret Dumont.
Then there was the movie from Spain's Bigas Luna, late of Goldenballs, about
the little boy, his older pal and the big-breasted circus ballerina they
fight over. Tiresome Fellini rip-off? No. Charming, stylish and funny.
How about Jefery Levy's SFW? This rock-scored, kaleidoscopic US movie is
about a young hostage-crisis survivor (Backbeat's Stephen Dorff), who after
36 days in a convenience store at the mercy of a lunatic's video-camera
whose images were broadcast 'live' across the nation, tries to adjust to the
vulgar glare of media heroism. It threatens to be a glib, easy-target
topical melodrama but gains in wit and bite as it goes on.
The only undisputed flops have been Alexandre Rockwell's Somebody To Love -
a drippy New York love story set among what seem to be the underworld folk
left over from Woody Allen's film - and Ermanno Olmi's The Bible Part 1.
This is subtitled Genesis: Creation And Flood - and yes, Olmi plans to film
the entire Good Book.
Not like this, we hope. The Noah sequence aside, with its eye-catching ark
and brief warmth of human detail, the film is no more than a glorified
nature documentary set to a maunderingly 'prophetic' voice-over.
The Olmi style seems even more ossified in a festival that has just produced
Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Some people loved this film, some hated
it. The only sane response is to do both.
Based on a story by Hollywood's favourite enfant terrible Quentin Tarantino
(Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), the movie is a two-hour bloodbath. The main
terrorists are a young couple (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis) who, after a
cross-country murder spree in the film's first half, repeat the mayhem when
they break out of jail in the second.
That Oliver Stone was becoming an eccentric film-maker we knew from the St
Vitus style of JFK. But even that seems measured beside the poetic epilepsy
of this film. Manic jump-cuts; topsy-turvy angles; high-speed alternations
between black-and-white and colour, film and video, reality and
hallucination; split-second bits of newsreel, animation.
Since the soundtrack also bawls out rock music, some have called the whole
thing a feature-length pop promo. But it is much more. Despite the suspect
encouragement it might offer susceptible filmgoers - that killing is
exhilarating - it is inspired.
The fragmented approach is not arbitrary. Stone offers us different ways of
viewing the same story at the same time: documentary, fantasy, home movie,
even sitcom. Scenes from the girl's childhood are enacted as clips from a TV
comedy series, with comic Rodney Dangerfield as Dad and canned laughter
greeting each dialogue exchange. Later, Stone derides the couch potato
culture again in the figure of an Aussie-accented tabloid-TV interviewer
(Robert Downey Jr, very funny) who follows the couple's jailbreak live.
Natural Born Killers is an alarming work, and for some a demented one.
(Tarantino himself has disowned the movie). But you cannot expect tranquil
responses to a film that proposes a whole new direction for film-making
itself - and that never offers spectators the soft option of a single,
moralising perspective on its bloody subject.

<HEAD>Stoppard's Debut Film Awarded Golden Lion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   English playwright Tom Stoppard's debut
movie ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' received the top
prize Saturday at the 47th Venice Film Festival amid boos and
whistles from some of the media.
   The film, starring actor Richard Dreyfuss, reinterprets
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet'' from the point of view of the prince's two
old school chums, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who become
unwittingly involved in the power play between Hamlet and his
stepfather.
   Stoppard's 1966 play by the same name was a hit, but the film
was not predicted to take the Golden Lion prize despite favorable
reviews.
   The favorite, Martin Scorsese's ``Goodfellas,'' won the
second-place Silver Lion Award for direction. The film depicts life
in the American underworld, with Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro
in a supporting role.
   The award for Best Actress went to Gloria Munchmeyer for her
starring role in Chilean director Silvio Caiozzi's film ``The Moon
in the Mirror.''
   The Best Actor award went to Oleg Borisov, protagonist of ``The
Only Witness'' by Bulgarian director Michail Pandurski.
   New Zealand director Jane Campion's ``An Angel at My Table'' won
the jury's ``special grand prize'' and received a long standing
ovation.
   A nine-person jury, headed by American author Gore Vidal, judged
21 films from 18 countries.

<HEAD>Horror Film Rooted in Author's Experience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When horror maven Stephen King taught
creative writing at the University of Maine, he moved his family
into a house near a cemetery for pets.
   The setting inspired the best-selling author's ``Pet Sematary,''
which he adapted to the screen for the new Paramount Pictures
horror movie.
   The house was on Route 15, a speedway for truckers. Dogs, cats
and other animals didn't stand a chance.
   ``Everything in the book and in the movie is true _ up to a
certain point where it crosses the line into fantasy,'' King said
in an interview.
   Directed by Mary Lambert (``Siesta''), the movie stars Dale
Midkiff as Louis Creed, Fred Gwynne as his neighbor, Jud, and
Denise Crosby as his wife, Rachel. It features a cameo appearance
by King, who portrays a minister presiding at the funeral of the
Creeds' 2-year-old son, who wanders out to the highway chasing a
kitten and is hit by a truck.
   ``Pet Sematary,'' whose theme of returning from the dead is
derivative of the popular tale ``The Monkey's Paw,'' is a thriller
that unravels the evil legacy of an ancient Indian burial ground.
   While living in Orrington, where giant fertilizer trucks
frequently sped along the highway in front of his house, King
witnessed the deathof his daughter's cat, Smucky. In ``Pet
Sematary,'' little Ellie Creed's cat, Church, meets the same fate.
   The King feline was immortalized in the novel and the movie with
a grave marker that read, ``Smucky, he was obedient.''
   Even more anguishing to King was the time he tackled his
2-year-old son just as he was about to dash onto the road, an
episode that inspired the tragic denouement of ``Pet Sematary.''
   The film and the novel reflect the terror that strikes at the
hearts of parents when they recognize how precious and fragile the
lives of their young children can be, King said.
   ``We're not talking about Freddie or Jason here,'' he said,
referring to the popular villains of the ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' and ``Friday the 13th'' series. ``We're talking about a
kid who gets killed in a senseless road accident.''
   Following publication of the 1983 novel, which remained on the
New York Times best-seller list for more than 30 weeks, souvenir
hunters visited the Orrington cemetery and removed most of the
grave markers.
   Millions of readers have paid vicarious visits to rural Maine
through King's spine-chilling novels, but ``Pet Sematary'' is the
first movie adaptation to be filmed in the author's home state.
   Aside from scenes of a roadside neon lobster sign, Bangor
International Airport or the clock tower in downtown Ellsworth, the
Maine setting provides a feel for a state that has seldom been
showcased by Hollywood producers, the author said.
   ``It adds a lot,'' he said, predicting that audiences will
appreciate the authenticity of the locale. ``They're going to know
that it's Maine. And just as important, they're going to know that
it's not California.''
   King, whose other books have been filmed in such locations as
California, North Carolina, Oregon and the Canadian province of
Ontario, insisted that ``Pet Sematary'' be made in Maine.
   It was seen as a shot in the arm for the nascent Maine Film
Commission, which has been trying to lure production companies to
Maine and help the state recover from its disappointing loss of
``On Golden Pond'' to neighboring New Hampshire.
   While the fictitious setting of ``Pet Sematary'' is called
Ludlow _ a town located in Aroostook County _ King acknowledged
that the cemetery site is actually in Orrington, a suburb 10 miles
outside Bangor. He lived there when he returned to the state
university, his alma mater, as a writer-in-residence.
   King, who has been openly critical of the movie versions of
several of his books, has nothing but praise for the latest film,
which is also the only one for which he wrote the screenplay. Rob
Reiner's highly acclaimed ``Stand By Me'' remains his favorite
movie adaptation of his writings.
   A Maine native, the author acknowledges that his familiarity
with his home state makes it an ideal setting for his fiction, but
he feels the nature of the place also provides a gothic flavor.
   ``We're a little bit cut off, a little bit insular here, and
it's truer as you get further north,'' he said. ``I like to get
away from the centers of population, to places where things could
happen and no one would really know.''

DARK, SAVAGE SIDE EMERGES IN NEW 'HENRY V'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: YOUNG BRITISH ACTOR-DIRECTOR KENNETH BRANAGH'S SKILL AND PASSION EQUAL 
HIS DARING IN TAKING ON LAURENCE OLIVIER'S 1944 TRIPLE FEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heroism is something the movies have often cheapened; verbal poetry and 
rhetoric they often ignore altogether. Yet -- seemingly on fire with all three 
-- the young British actor-director Kenneth Branagh has brought them, in 
blazing measures, to his adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Henry V" (opening 
at the Park Theatre in San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
At first, it seems a madly audacious endeavor. Branagh -- trying to match 
Laurence Olivier's astonishing triple feat of adapting, directing and starring 
in a filmed "Henry" -- butts heads with an inarguably great movie and the 
champion British classical actor of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, his skill and passion equal his daring. This thrilling new version of the 
play complements rather than challenges Olivier's. If Olivier gave us the glint 
of sunlight on armor and the wind roaring through the pennants and flags, 
Branagh gives us the rot, the mold, the wounds and the crusted blood 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, in a conceit dazzling in its wittiness and prettiness, staged "Henry" 
in a mock-up of the Globe Theater and sets skewed to the style of Renaissance 
Flemish or Dutch paintings. Branagh's sets are the vast, empty castles of movie 
epics or horror shows, and his battlefields are plateaus of mud and gore under 
gray, bristling skies, where men die foully. If Olivier gave us the ultimate 
poet-warrior king, Branagh gives us a blunt but brave boy, a sawed-off, 
sandy-haired runt, passing through fire and chaos to manhood. This is a dark, 
savage "Henry" -- post-Marx, post-Brecht, post-"Paths of Glory," post-Vietnam 
-- in which the heroism is undercut with bloodshed and in which the Chorus 
(Derek Jacobi) glides, at first, through a movie sound stage, all in black, his 
voice scarringly urbane. 
</P>
<P>
Death is stripped of every scrap of nobility. Both sides, British and French, 
are equally full of heroism and cowardice, sadism and self-sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
In place of Olivier's great showpiece scene -- the equestrian French army 
charging jubilantly right to left in a burst of stallion exhilaration -- 
Branagh gives us a "Chimes of Midnight"-like battle of stabbings and clouts in 
the mud, capped by a somber, dazzling Wellesian tracking shot on Henry, as he 
carries the corpse of Falstaff's Boy across a somber, reeking wasteland of 
broken bodies. Branagh, only 28 -- about Henry's age at Agincourt, and almost a 
decade younger than Olivier when he made his 1944 version -- is a current 
Wunderkind of British theater. And his versatility in his only two movie parts, 
"High Season" and "A Month in the Country," was shocking, as if the same actor 
could master roles meant for either Monty Python or Montgomery Clift. 
</P>
<P>
In playing Henry V, he's taking one of the great glamour roles in Shakespeare. 
Yet he deglamorizes it, ripening steadily through the forge of warfare until 
the burst of fiery rhetoric on his great "St. Crispin's" speech. 
</P>
<P>
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers," keens the erstwhile Prince Hal, 
his face shining in the gloom, to his mud-encrusted, outmanned army and, like 
Churchill's surging wartime oratory during the Blitz, this speech makes the 
blood run hot, the sinews quiver. That's the force of Branagh's conception. 
Olivier, working in wartime to arouse national spirit, gave us a hero who 
surpassed understanding. Branagh roots his in the loam of common character. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is about a different kind of heroism as well: the heroism of the 
theatrical ensemble. Paul Scofield is an uncharacteristically sage King Charles 
VI; Ian Holm a dour Fluellen; Robert Stephens a scabrous, cowardly thick 
Pistol; Charles Kay and Alec McCowen two magnificently conspiratorial church 
prelates; Emma Thompson a notably non-featherbrained Katherine (playing a 
deliciously wry courting scene with her husband, Branagh); Robbie Coltrane (in 
flashback scenes borrowed from the "Henry IV" plays) a sad, blubbery dying 
Falstaff, and Judi Dench a definitively funny Mistress Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The British won at Agincourt because of superior technology. The expert Welsh 
archers mowed the French cavalry down. But in Shakespeare's world, they also 
won because of gorgeous poetry and heart-stirring eloquence. Branagh's expertly 
cut and reshaped "Henry V" (Times-rated Mature for violence) gives us the grimy 
face of war, yet he also gives us the guts -- and the soul and poetry that 
animate them both. Egoist and daring scamp Branagh may well be, but so, in 
ways, were Olivier and Welles. It's a pleasure to welcome this young lion and 
his company's splendid "Henry" to their ranks.

<HEAD>Rambo's Creator Wrote an `Anti-War' Novel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   English profressor David Morrell had been
thinking about the returning veterans in his classes, and about a
World War II hero, when he began work in 1969 on his first novel.
   Published in 1972, ``First Blood'' had an angry hero named
Rambo. Ten years later it became a movie starring Sylvester
Stallone.
   ``The original intent was that the first novel would be an
anti-war novel ... to make vivid what it would be like to have a
war in the United States like what was going on in Asia, how
senseless it was,'' Morrell said.
   A secondary theme was the stress suffered by returning veterans.
   The inspiration came from veterans in his classes, Morrell said,
and from the life of Audie Murphy, the actor who was America's most
decorated GI in World War II.
   ``Audie Murphy had done a film called `To Hell and Back' in
which he dramatized his experiences in the war,'' Morrell said.
Before his death in 1971, he had begun a book talking about the
problems he had after coming home, Morrell added.
   The movie version of ``First Blood'' was generally faithful to
the book. Both told of a fight which began with a small-town
sheriff leaning on an unkempt drifter and ended with a town in
flames from the rage of a single Vietnam veteran.
   In the book, Rambo's body count exceeded 200, including some
National Guardsmen shot in retreat. In the film, he killed two or
three.
   Rambo ended the book full of bullet holes and with his head
blown off by his former commanding officer. In the movie, he walked
off in handcuffs, ready for sequels.
   Morrell doesn't mind at all. In fact, he wrote books based on
the first sequel, ``Rambo: First Blood Part II,'' and the upcoming
``Rambo III,'' as well as the first draft of the script for ``Rambo
III.''
   ``Rambo II'' was not only a much bigger film than ``Rambo I,''
but it made the character part of the nation's political vocabulary.
   ``I sort of have to chuckle at that, that I should have invented
a character whose name has entered the language,'' Morrell said.
``As I look back in my lifetime, I guess the only novelist who did
the same is Joseph Heller with `Catch-22.'''
   Morrell owns stock in Carolco, the production company that
bought the film and merchandising rights for Rambo.
   ``I have profit participation in the pictures, and I do have
profit participation in the merchandising, and I also get a flat
fee whenever they make a feature,'' said the author, who came to
New York with Stallone and co-star Richard Crenna to promote the
film. ``And, as you might expect, it's been lucrative.''
   Morrell owns the literary copyright, so he gets the lion's share
of book profits. ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' was a best seller
even before the film came out.
   Morrell's ``Brotherhood of the Rose,'' a book without Rambo, was
picked up by NBC-TV as the basis for a miniseries planned for next
season.
   ``First Blood'' was written while Morrell was earning a
doctorate at Penn State University, and he went on to teach at Iowa
State University before becoming a full-time writer in 1986.
   One of the ironies of the Rambo phenomenon is that neither
Morrell nor Stallone had any part in the Vietnam war. Born in
Canada, Morrell was 23 when he came to the United States in 1967.
And like Stallone, he was something of a tough kid.
   ``My father died in the Second World War. I never knew the
man,'' said Morrell, who grew up in Kitchener-Waterloo near
Toronto. ``I was raised by my mother, who was a single parent for
quite a while, and was forced to give me up at times to a foster
home.
   ``Later _ we didn't have very much money, we didn't get a phone
until I was 12 _ I spent most of my time in back alleys with street
gangs. The guys I hung around with went to prison. I became a
professor.''
   His salvation was the TV show, ``Route 66.'' Morrell identified
with George Maharis' streetwise character, and he wrote a fan
letter to series writer Sterling Silliphant.
   Silliphant's reply, encouraging his young correspondent to take
a stab at writing, is framed and hanging on a wall at home in Iowa
City, Morrell said.
   The Rambo books, he said, deal in some serious issues but are
basically escapism.
   ``Life for most people is at best boring, and I use boring
almost in an existential sense as Sartre does in `Nausea,' where it
weighs you down and you have a powerful sense of what is my reason
for getting up this morning?''
   As his 15-year-old son lay dying of cancer last year, Morrell
said books helped him survive.
   ``I'd be sitting there for like eight hours at a time, and I
would be reading a book by my friend Stephen King. And I don't know
if I could have stayed sane for those eight hours if it hadn't been
for Steve.
   ``I could not have read John Updike under those circumstances.
It would have been too real,'' Morrell said. ``What I needed to do
was get out of that room and, in a sense, get out of my head _ and
Steve did it for me. So if I can do that for somebody else, I think
I've performed a social function.''

The Lion King, Walt Disney's latest animated epic, opened last week in the
UK with all the hype of a film that has already taken US box offices by
storm. Like each new Disney release, the latest extravaganza is packed with
ground-breaking techniques to captivate audiences and animators alike.
While The Lion King, by most accounts, reinforces Disney's position as the
world's pre-eminent animator, a small UK company, Cambridge Animation
Systems, hopes it has developed new software that will dramatically change
the way many cartoons are made.
Apart from the cleverness of the software, now surrounded by patents,
Cambridge Animation has taken one crucial step. It has recognised there is
little value in developing a wonderful new product if it cannot reach its
market and support it. As a result the company will today announce it has
raised Pounds 500,000 of new equity from venture capitalists 3i, to add to
Pounds 300,000 raised earlier this year from Jafco, Japan's largest venture
capital group, and the company's original institutional investor, Korda &amp;
Co.
'One of the reasons products are jeopardised is that entrepreneurs are not
prepared to raise enough money to get the product to market,' says Ruth
McCall, one of three founders of Cambridge Animation.
The three founders set about developing the Animo suite of products in late
1990 when they saw that automation had hardly touched the production of
two-dimensional cartoon animation.
While some companies were using software to computerise the simplest and
most repetitive part of the process - the 'in-betweening' where pen and ink
are used to colour hundreds of different acetates - no one had attempted to
computerise the whole process while leaving the animator room for
creativity.
As a result, many animators ship work to studios in the Philippines, Vietnam
and China where there is a significant labour cost advantage but where
control of the process and quality is greatly reduced. Animo says its
product will remove the cost disadvantage and increase quality, helping to
repatriate animation work to Europe.
The Animo software is being assessed by Nelvana of Canada and Warner Feature
Films, which are about to computerise parts of their animation studios. In
the case of Warner, Cambridge Animation is up against US Animation in Los
Angeles and Soft Image Co in Montreal, both of which offer software which
McCall claims does less of the animation process.
But a year ago they needed more cash to support the product, to introduce it
at trade shows and open sales and maintenance offices in the US and Japan.
Hence, the Pounds 1m of new capital.
Cambridge Animation's strategy for developing and exploiting its idea was
fairly traditional - a straight approach to investors. But there are also a
number of government initiatives designed to increase the rate at which
high-tech ideas are developed and commercialised.
At a European level, the Commission's Value programme aims to disseminate
the results of European Union funded research and to exploit its potential
across borders and across industries. The programme, administered through 27
Value Relay Centres - four in the UK - is part of the Third Framework
programme of research and technological development, which is due to be
upgraded in December.
One beneficiary of the programme is Oxford Computer Services, a software
developer and IT consultancy set up by university academics. For the past
three years, the company and nine European partners have been collaborating
on a Ecu3m (Pounds 2.36m) project to develop engineering software that aids
the design and increases the applications of computer co-ordinated
manufacturing techniques.
The so-called MCOES system is being used by Valmet in Finland, which
manufactures paper-making machinery, but otherwise the consortium had no
customers.
'We had the software but it was a long way from workstations and being
packaged,' says JO Thomas, director of Oxford Computer Services. 'So we
approached the Value programme. We asked them to look for end users -
factories where it might be installed - and we asked can MCOES be used for
existing Cad-cam companies?'
As a result of the introduction from Technology Broker, the Cambridge-based
Value Relay Centre, Oxford Computer Services is negotiating to install its
been put in touch with EDS Unigraphics, part of the giant US computer
services group now a subsidiary of General Motors.
'The Technology Broker has been extremely effective,' says Thomas. 'This has
been a genuine attempt to try to fill the gap between the invention process
and having a product people can buy.'
Jean-Noel Durvy, the Commission's co-ordinator of the Value programme,
expects ministers at the Research Council in early December to approve a
replacement for the Value programme under the Fourth Framework. This will
combine the goals of Value and the Sprint programme, which focuses on
encouraging technology transfer in the community.
The previous Value programmes were limited to EU funded research. But the
new programme is expected to have a budget of about Ecu290m over five years
and will attempt to encourage the dissemination and exploitation of any
community-based research through an expanded network of Relay Centres.
Government support is also available at a national level. In the UK, the
Department of Trade and Industry offers support at two stages during an
idea's development. Its Smart awards - the Small Firms Merit Award for
Research and Technology for companies with up to 50 employees  - first helps
the development of ideas with grants awarded through regionally-based
competitions, and then offers a large second grant to help
commercialisation.
Since the Smart awards were launched in 1986, more than 1,000 companies have
been helped through the regionally-based competition and the DTI has given
grants of Pounds 66m. A similar Spur award - Support for Products Under
Research - is available to companies with up to 250 employees and has
provided Pounds 36m of assistance to more than 400 projects since it was
launched in 1991.
This kind of programme of support has been widely applauded. One
Newcastle-based company, Novocastra Laboratories, says it could not have
developed without Smart.
The company was set up by Professor Wilson Horne, professor of pathology at
Newcastle University. It has won seven Smart awards to develop and
commercialise its process for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies used
by research establishments worldwide. After seven awards the DTI has said it
will not be winning any more competitions.
Brian Angus, another academic and director of Novocastra, says the support
from the university, which took only 20 per cent of the equity, was crucial.
But so was the Smart programme. 'There was very strong financial support
through Smart for the development of new ideas to a point where it might be
commercialised,' says Angus.
'Most of the things they have funded have yielded a commercial return. It
has been a great help to a company that started with no commercial capital.'
Novocastra is expecting sales of Pounds 1m this year from the 20 products it
has developed and the 200 it sells on behalf of others.
While the DTI and - increasingly - the EU are becoming more aware of the
need to commercialise the fruits of Europe's intellectual capital, some of
their efforts remain bureacratic.
McCall recalls an approach Cambridge Animation made to the EU Cartoon
Initiative, part of the Commission's effort to support the union's
audio-visual industry. Cambridge Animation asked for funding for a studio to
make a cartoon feature film using an early version of its software.
Eighteen months later - when Cambridge Animation had already completed most
of the development work - McCall says the Cartoon Initiative came back with
the idea that it would 'fund a study' of the uses of new technology in the
animation industry.
Some officials trying to support the commercialisation of products still
have to learn that 'late' is rarely better than 'never' in fast moving
global markets.

   English playwright Tom Stoppard's debut
movie, ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' captured the top
prize today at the Venice Film Festival.
   The film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, reinterprets Shakespeare's
``Hamlet'' from the point of view of the prince's two old school
chums, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who become unwittingly
involved in, and ultimately victims of, the power play between
Hamlet and his stepfather.
   A screen treatment of Stoppard's 1966 hit tragi-comic play by
the same name, the film was not generally expected to take the
Golden Lion prize despite the favorable reviews it received after
its screening.
   The favorite had been Martin Scorcese's ``Goodfellas,'' which
instead won the second place Silver Lion Award for direction. The
film provides a vividly realistic portrait of life in the American
underworld, with Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro in a supporting
role.
   The award for Best Actress went to Gloria Munchmeyer for her
starring role in Chilean director Silvio Caiozzi's film ``La Luna
En El Espejo'' (The Moon in the Mirror).
   The Best Actor award went to Oleg Borisov, protagonist of
``Edinstvenijat Svidetel,'' (The Only Witness) by Bulgarian
director Michail Pandurski.
   New Zealand director Jane Campion's entry, ``An Angel at My
Table,'' won the jury's ``special grand prize,'' and received a
long standing ovation from an appreciative crowd at the awards
ceremony.
   A nine-person jury headed by American author Gore Vidal judged
the 21 films from 18 countries running in the competition at this
year's 47th edition of the festival.
   Meanwhile, some critics at the festival have blasted ``Henry and
June,'' a controversial American movie about Henry Miller that has
earned an ``X'' rating for its erotic scenes.
   But many critics at the festival, which ends today, also have
signed a petition urging the repeal of the ``X'' rating on grounds
that it limits artistic freedom.
   Set in the literary scene in Paris in the 1930s, the film is
based on sections of the diaries of Anais Nin and the
autobiographical novels of Miller, an American expatriate. Both
Miller and Nin were entranced with the young June Smith.
   ``It was just a bad film,'' commented Irene Bignardi, critic of
Rome's La Repubblica, after the world premiere Friday. ``But even
Americans who are rather infantile would not be shocked by it.''
   ``It's enough to put you off sex,'' quipped The Guardian's
critic, Derek Malcolm.
   The film stars Swedish-American Uma Thurman, whose first break
came as a seduced adolescent in Stephen Frears' ``Dangerous
Liaisons.'' It was directed by Philip Kaufman, whose other movies
include ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``The Right
Stuff.''
   Produced by Universal Pictures, the film was rated ``X'' last
month by the U.S. Motion Picture Association's rating board,
meaning no one under 17 can be admitted for viewing.
   Universal has vowed to appeal the rating in an attempt to
challenge the 22-year-old rating system.

   The minister didn't get to the
church on time, but it came as little surprise to the 450 guests
because the man presiding over the ceremony was notoriously tardy
campaigner Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson arrived an hour after the scheduled start of Saturday's
wedding for businessman Ahmad Bayaa, 35, and bride Jill Maria
Baumgartner, 24, of Laguna Hills, then performed a 10-minute
ceremony in the gazebo of the ritzy Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
   The Baptist minister and former Democratic presidential hopeful
was running behind because he was in Washington earlier in the day
for the 25th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have A
Dream Speech.''
   But Jackson's late arrival here didn't bother the groom.
   ``I love Jesse,'' Bayaa said. ``I have met him twice, and I
thought it would be fantastic if Jesse does this wedding because he
represents the conscience of the people in America.''
   Besides, had Jackson never arrived, the couple still would be
husband and wife. They were married earlier in the day; Jackson's
was to be the second ceremony of the day.

   Slugger Don Mattingly predicted he would
not finish his career with the New York Yankees because owner
George Steinbrenner eventually will become angry with him and trade
the All-Star first baseman.
   ``It's going to happen,'' Mattingly said Sunday. ``He's got to
do what he's got to do.''
   He acknowledged that his criticism of Steinbrenner may have
sparked the trade rumors that began surfacing this weekend.
   Mattingly, who will earn $2.2 million in 1989 and $2.5 million
in 1990, the final season of his three-year contract, sharply
criticized Steinbrenner a week ago, although he did not name the
owner.
   Pat Gillick, Toronto Blue Jays general manager, predicted New
York will trade Mattingly, possibly before the season ends.
   But Bob Quinn, Yankees general manager, said Mattingly most
likely wouldn't be traded.
   Other teams ``generally asked us about his availability and our
answer was `No, not unless you can overwhelm us.' My guess is there
isn't a team in baseball that can satisfy us,'' Quinn said.

   The 7-month-old L'Esperance quintuplets made
a timid public debut, modeling back-to-school fashions at a
shopping mall.
   The siblings, believed to be the nation's first quints conceived
by in-vitro fertilization, appeared taken aback by all the
attention Saturday at the Oakland Mall.
   Only Alexandria appeared comfortable, although she screamed when
she was introduced to the 400 in the crowd. The others _ Veronica,
Erica, Raymond and Danielle _ looked terrified.
   The quints' mother, Michele L'Esperance, said she did not mind
having her children in the public eye.
   ``I don't see a problem with it,'' she said. ``When they're old
enough, they'll tell me if they like it.''

   Opposing views on freedom of expression and
religion clashed at the Venice Film Festival over attempts to stop
the showing of Martin Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   The movie, considered sacrilegious or blasphemous by some, is
one of 60 films to be featured at the festival that started today
and runs through Sept. 9, and is not among the 22 competing for the
Golden Lion Award.
   Italy's dominant Christian Democrat party and some Roman
Catholic leaders and groups have condemned Scorsese's film as
blasphemous because of a scene that depicts Jesus on the cross
hallucinating about abandoning his role as a redeemer, making love
to Mary Magdalene and raising a family with her.
   Venice's prosecutor has asked a judge to ban the film in Venice
under Italy's laws on obscenity and blasphemy. The judge has not
made a decision.
   ``It's amazing that still today after many battles for civil
rights, the right of the film festival to feature movies chosen for
their artistic value can be questioned,'' said Paolo Portoghesi,
president of the Venice Biennale, which organizes the festival.
   Festival director Guglielmo Biraghi said Sunday he ``is in favor
of the controversy and therefore welcomes it'' because it nourishes
the 56-year-old film festival, the world's oldest.
   Among the U.S. films competing for the Golden Lion are David
Mamet's ``Things Change,'' Ivan Passer's ``Haunted Summer'' and
Alan Ruolph's ``The Moderns.''
   Italian director Franco Zeffirelli's ``Young Toscanini'' will
have its premier at the festival, although he once threatened to
withdraw it if ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' was not
rescheduled.
   ``Toscanini'' originially was scheduled to be shown a day after
Scorsese's. Zeffirelli said he wanted ``distance between the
films,'' apparently so his new work would not be overlooked in the
controversy. Now ``Young Toscanini'' will be shown two days before
Scorsese's.
