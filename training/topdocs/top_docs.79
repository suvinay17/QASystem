<TEXT>     This is intended to be your guide to recreationsl sports clubs. We want to
help you find the right club -- whether you run, hike, ski or want to get
involved in any other part of the active life.;   If you can't seem to find
the right club in your area, don't worry. This is not a complete list. If you
don't find what you're looking for, try one of the shops that sells equipment
related to the sport in which your are interested. Bicycle shops, for example,
normally have a wealth of information available on area clubs.;   In addition,
some clubs occasionally promote specific events in our weekly Venturing Out
calendar, which appears in the Thursday Venture section.; AUTO; (box) Name:

<HL> Zip Code Toasted As 'Roaring Success' On 25th Birthday --- Postal Service Officials Say 97% of U.S. Mail Has It, 95% Even Has It Right </HL>
<SO> </SO>

<TEXT>
   After a quarter century on the job, the ZIP code -- like most of us -- has gained a little weight.
But it still helps smooth the flow of nearly half the world's mail.

   Friday marked the 25th anniversary of that string of numbers bringing up the rear of every U.S. address, a system ordered into use by by then-Postmaster General J. Edward Day, who says he simply got tired of waiting for bureaucrats to finish studying the idea.

   Mr. Day's original five-digit system held sway for 20 years and is still the most commonly seen.
An expanded version was introduced in 1983, though, adding four more numbers to bring the total to nine -- a voluntary addition officially called "ZIP Plus 4" but referred to in postal circles as "Son of ZIP."

   The basic system, says senior assistant postmaster general John G. Mulligan, has been a "roaring success."

   The U.S., with only about 6% of the world's population, has 50% of the world's mail volume, Mr. Mulligan notes.

   By way of comparison, the New York metropolitan area handles about the same volume of mail as all of Britain, and the Chicago area's mail volume is about equal to Japan's, said Mr. Day, who now is retired from government service and is living in a Maryland suburb of Washington.

   In the 25 years since the introduction of ZIP -- which stands for Zone Improvement Program -- U.S. mail volume has more than doubled, but the Postal Service employs only about 15% more people, Mr. Mulligan said.
And the ZIP system is a big factor in that labor saving.

   "No direct calculation of the exact savings has been made," Mr. Mulligan said.
"It's hard to separate the effect of the ZIP code from other things.
But believe me, I think it's up there in the several billions of dollars."

   In 1963, the United States Post Office carried 67.9 billion pieces of mail, sorted by human beings at a maximum rate of 800 items an hour.
Now reconstituted as the U.S. Postal Service, the agency handled 153.9 billion pieces last year.
With ZIP codes, machines can sort 27,000 to 35,000 pieces of mail an hour.

   Public acceptance has been "amazing," said Mr. Mulligan, with ZIP codes on about 97 percent of the items mailed.
Even better, he added, 95% of mail comes in with correct ZIP codes.

   A variety of coding systems had been under study when Mr. Day lost patience.
What he did was simply to announce, during a speech in December 1962, that a new system would take effect the following July 1.
The new system assigned a code to each of the nation's more than 30,000 post offices.

   The ZIP code divided the nation into 10 slices, each starting with a different number, from 0 in New England to 9 on the Pacific Coast.

   The next two numbers designate a major city in the area, for example 606 is Chicago.
Finally, the last two numbers localize the address to a neighborhood post office.
And the four newly added digits in the code narrow the delivery down to one side of a city block or even one floor of a large office building in a major city.

   After a quarter century on the job, the ZIP
code _ like most of us _ has gained a little weight. But it still
helps smooth the flow of nearly half the world's mail.
   Friday marked the 25th anniversary of that string of numbers
bringing up the rear of every American address, a system ordered
into use by by then-Postmaster General J. Edward Day, who says he
simply got tired of waiting for bureaucrats to finish studying the
idea.
   Day's original five-digit system held sway for 20 years and is
still the most commonly seen.
   An expanded version was introduced in 1983, though, adding four
more numbers to bring the total to nine _ a voluntary addition
officially called ``ZIP Plus 4'' but referred to in postal circles
as ``Son of ZIP.''
   The basic system, says senior assistant postmaster general John
G. Mulligan, has been a ``roaring success.''
   The United States, with only about 6 percent of the world's
population, has 50 percent of the world's mail volume, Mulligan
points out.
   By way of comparison, the New York metropolitan area handles
about the same volume of mail as all of Great Britain, and the
Chicago area's mail is about equal to Japan's, said Day, who now is
retired from government service and is living in a Maryland suburb
of Washington.
   In the 25 years since the introduction of ZIP _ which stands for
Zone Improvement Program _ U.S. mail volume has more than doubled,
but the Postal Service employs only about 15 percent more people,

   A variety of coding systems had been under study when Day lost
patience. What he did was simply to announce, during a speech in
December 1962, that a new coding system would take effect the
following July 1.
   It worked. Years of study ended and within six months the agency
decided on a five-digit system, divided the nation into regions and
assigned a code to each of the more than 30,000 post offices in the
country.
   The system took effect July 1, 1963, accompanied by promotional
hoopla organized by the Post Office and grumbling by people afraid
they would lose their identities to some anonymous numbers.
   The ZIP code divided the nation into 10 slices, each starting
with a different number, from ``0'' in New England to ``9'' on the
Pacific Coast.
   The next two numbers designate a major city in the area, for
example 606 is Chicago. Finally, the last two numbers localize the

500,000 IN COUNTY TO GET NEW ZIP CODES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service will introduce new ZIP codes for about 500,000 San
Diego County residents living south of Interstate 8 outside San Diego city
limits, Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new ZIP codes, which should be introduced early next year, will have a 919
prefix, a code never used before anywhere.
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego will remain covered almost entirely by ZIPs with 921
prefixes, and the part of the county north of I-8 will continue to have 920
prefixes. Those two ZIP prefixes are the only ones now in use in the county.
</P>
<P>
ZIP is an acronym for Zoning Improvement Plan.
</P>
<P>
The only residents and businesses affected will be those in South County and
San Ysidro, which will change to a 92173 ZIP code. Many post-office box holders
throughout the county have already received new ZIPs.
</P>
<P>
Boyd said, in what he termed "a very rough guess," that about 500,000 people
will be affected.
</P>
<P>
The change comes as postal officials are trying to streamline service in the
county with automated sorting systems, machines that read ZIP codes and sort
mail without human operators.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of a new ZIP code was inevitable because of the rise in the area's
population, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
He said the postal service wants to have a second sorting plant operating by
the end of 1993. Bids on that structure, to be located off Interstate 15 near
Carmel Mountain Road, are scheduled to be taken in about a year. A sorting
depot on Midway Drive near Lindbergh Field now handles mail for the entire
county.
</P>
<P>
According to Mike Cannone, postal service communications manager in San Diego,
two things could happen once both plants are operating. The Midway Drive
facility might sort just city mail and the new plant county mail.
</P>
<P>
Or, the new plant might sort all mail coming into the county, while the Midway
Drive plant would handle all mail going out of the county, which would make the
best use of its proximity to the airport, Cannone said.
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service will begin its official by-mail notification of the ZIP code
change to residents and businesses within four weeks, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
In San Ysidro, a community protest erupted two weeks ago after Postal Service
letters to post-office box holders there mistakenly stated that the community's
postal designation would be changed from San Ysidro to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
San Ysidro is one of two communities within the city of San Diego that does not
already have a 921 prefix. The Postal Service meant to inform them that their
their ZIP, not their city designation, would change.
</P>
<P>
"The mistake was made by someone who didn't realize the sensitivity of the
issue," Boyd said. "No wonder they were all up in arms." The people will get
letters within a week alerting them to the mistake.
</P>
<P>
The ZIP code for street addresses in the heavily Latino community will change
from 92073 to 92173, and post office boxes will be 92143.
</P>
<P>
The only locale within the city of San Diego that will not have a 921 prefix is
La Jolla, which will retain its 92037 ZIP for street addresses.
</P>
<P>
Cannone said two things make La Jolla different -- the fact that it has its own
postmaster, which San Ysidro does not, and its proximity to the other 920
prefix locations.
</P>
<P>
San Ysidro, on the other hand, will be wedged between 919 and 921 prefixes.
</P>
<P>
"ZIP codes are assigned because of the political realities and the operational
needs at the time," Cannone said.
</P>
<P>
He said Coronado will retain its 921 prefix.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NORTH COUNTY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North County's fast growth has generated so much mail volume that the U.S.
Postal Service has created additional ZIP codes for Oceanside and Escondido.
</P>
<P>
Postal Service spokesman Mike Cannone said Thursday that five ZIP codes will be
added in Oceanside and three in Escondido, beginning "a whole series of
changes" to keep pace with growth in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
The new ZIP codes will go into effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Five new ZIP codes in one city is definitely the biggest change we've had
probably anywhere in Southern California," Cannone said.
</P>
<P>
He said the additional ZIP areas will help speed up automated mail sorting,
affecting about 19,000 deliveries in Oceanside and 13,500 in Escondido.
</P>
<P>
Residents of areas where the ZIP code will be changed began receiving notices
this week so they will have time to order new stationery.
</P>
<P>
Mail addressed to the old ZIP codes will be delivered after July 1, but the
Postal Service is asking residents to promptly use the new codes to avoid
delays.
</P>
<P>
Beside the new ZIP codes, some postal box prefixes will be changed in Oceanside
and Escondido.

   U.S. ZIP-Code Conversions Zap Postal-Service Firms

   Rivals Give Stamp of Disapproval to
   Government's Free Nine-Digit Lists

   Small postal-service companies are accusing the U.S.
Postal Service of taking the zip out of their ZIP-code
business.
   Among other services, these companies update business
mailing lists by converting five-digit ZIP codes to newer
nine-digit numbers. The companies complain that the Postal
Service is stealing their customers by offering to do the
conversions free.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's got an entire industry outraged," says Gene Del
Polito, executive director of the Third Class Mail
Association of Washington, D.C. The Postal Service has
started aggressively marketing the conversion service in the
last several months.
   The several hundred private postal-service companies and
letter shops complain that the gargantuan Postal Service, the
nation's largest civilian employer, is beating up on small
business. Many of the companies have invested heavily in
computers and software to perform the very mailing-list
updates that the government's postal agency is now offering
at no cost.
   The private firms charge anywhere from $2 to $6 per
thousand names for providing "ZIP-plus-four" codes, which
qualify bulk mailers for postage discounts and are supposed
to speed delivery. The customer provides computer disks of
ZIP-coded addresses, which the service company runs through a
computer program that adds the four additional digits.
Usually within a few days or a few weeks, the customer is
given back revised disks with the new codes.
   The nine-digit ZIPs, when scanned by high-speed
optical-character readers, identify addresses down to a
specific city block or apartment-house floor. Machines can
also apply bar codes to envelopes with up-to-date ZIP codes,
which makes sorting quicker.
   The Postal Service has been offering free conversion for
small mailing lists for several years, but the criticism from
private industry didn't surface until last fall. That's when
local postal officials began actively soliciting much larger
lists. The timing reflects new Postal Service employee
performance guidelines that tie salary bonuses for postal
managers with the number of addresses they convert to
ZIP-plus-four.
   The Postal Service says it's providing the free
conversions to help cut postal costs and hasten a fully
automated mail system. It says it will quit when it thinks
private companies can satisfy market demand. "We only want to
stay in coding activity until there's enough software and
technology to handle the tens of billions of addresses out
there," says Robert Krause, director of the Postal Service's
office of address information systems.
   The Postal Service says that once companies see the
benefits of updating their mailing lists, they will do it
regularly with private mail shops. "It's like dope; if you
get hooked, you'll use it," agrees Ronald Friedman, president
of Group 1 Software Inc., a Greenbelt, Md., maker of
mailing-list software.
   The aim is a fully automated mail system by 1995. To meet
that goal, the Postal Service says it must persuade some
eight million small businesses and professional firms, most
of which spend less than $50,000 annually in postage, to
update their address lists.
   Small mailers that send out a couple of hundred monthly
invoices, or the occasional newsletter, typically handle
their own mailing chores and seldom patronize mail-service
companies. But the private service firms say the government's
increasingly aggressive marketing of free ZIP-code conversion
is beginning to attract junk mailers and larger first-class
mailers that are the bread-and-butter of their business.
   Charles Thompson, president of Ace Mailing Services Inc.,
Smyrna, Ga., says the Postal Service is servicing a
186,000-name mailing list of W. S. Badcock Corp., a Mulberry,
Fla., furniture and appliance retailer that had been an Ace
client for eight years. Mr. Thompson says he has no quarrel
with the postal agency's attempts to reach small mailers that
don't use ZIP-plus-four, but adds: "Rather than selling to
people who have sloppy lists, they're taking on the major
accounts."
   Dick Wendel, Badcock's data processing vice president,
says the Postal Service's address-improvement offer was too
good to pass up. "Sure you're going to use the free service,"
he says.
   Todd Butler, president of Butler Business Services Inc.,
St. Marys, Ohio, says local postal officials assured him they
were targeting address lists of no more than 3,000 names.
Then he discovered that the Cincinnati post office was
offering free ZIP-code conversion to lists with 80,000 names.
"Lists that size are my baby," Mr. Butler says.
   Last fall, the Postal Service's southern division sought
bids on a contract that would offer ZIP-plus-four updating to
lists of as many as 15 million names. "So `small lists' went
from 3,000 to 15 million," Mr. Butler complains.
   Postal officials argue that automated mail will help stem
postage-rate increases. But Mr. Butler says postal customers
are underwriting the costs of the free conversion service in
the form of software and payments to private companies that
perform the conversion for the Postal Service.
   "If they charge their costs out, I'll compete and blow
them away," Mr. Butler insists. "But free, I can't compete."
   Mail-service company owners and trade-association
executives say they have argued their case through technical
committees set up to iron out postal users' problems. They
say they continue to complain, but the government isn't
showing much sympathy. "We protested this all the way up to
{Postmaster General Anthony} Frank, and all we get is lip
service," says Lee Epstein, president of Mailmen Inc., a
volume mail service in Hauppauge, N.Y.
   Mr. Krause says the Postal Service wants to cooperate. He
says local postmasters are instructed to inform customers who
ask about free ZIP-code conversion that private concerns will
do the same work, albeit for a price. He says mailing lists
must be updated every six months to qualify for discount
rates; post offices will do only one free conversion for most
customers. "No business customers should be led to believe
they can rely on the Postal Service long-term for their
address-improvement needs," he says.
   But even now, the industry insists it could handle all the
work. Mr. Friedman of Group 1 Software says the Postal
Service should put its efforts into promoting the concept of
ZIP-code conversion and leave the actual work to private
enterprise. He says, "We need more money out there selling
the religion. We'll deliver the Bibles."

<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- I work for the U.S. Postal Service. Before you make any
wisecracks, let me tell you what's on my mind.;   I work in a mail processing
facility in Lake Mary, Fla. I see thousands of letters and postcards every
day. We postal employees take a lot of heat for not delivering your mail when
the real problem is you, the sender. The American public does not know how to
address a letter or a post card.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  POSTAL SERVICE ASKS FOR MAIL ASSISTANCE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     An incredible number of cards and envelopes have no address or return
address. It upsets me to see a loving card to parents or important arrival
plans with a wrong ZIP code and no return address. I have to toss it into a
mail slot and it goes to Atlanta, never to be seen again.;   Granted, Ann,
we're not perfect and, handling over 500 million pieces a day nationwide, some
of the mail is bound to be delayed or ruined by sorting machines, but most of
the problems are due to carelessness on the part of the sender.;   Another
sticking point is the ZIP code. Are you aware that most of your mail is sorted
and routed by ZIP code? If your letter is addressed "Lake Mary, FL 92746,"
(correct ZIP is 32746) that letter will go to California, unless a sharp-eyed
clerk catches it. Believe it or not, your mail would get there faster if it
had no ZIP code, rather than an incorrect one. If you don't know the ZIP code,
call any post office and they will gladly tell you.;   Please ask your readers
to help us.;   -- S.G., Mid-Florida Facility;   DEAR S.G. -- I, too, see a lot
of mail, so I'm adding another suggestion. Please, folks, if your handwriting
is not great, print the address. And, please don't abbreviate the state. Write
it out. The confusion between Alabama and Alaska gets pretty bad, not to
mention Connecticut and Colorado, Michigan and Minnesota, etc.;   DEAR ANN --
My sisters and I were taught to help with the dishes and clean up whenever we
eat a meal in the home of a friend or a relative. If the hostess doesn't want
our help (some don't) we respect her wishes. We always offer, however, and
leave it up to the hostess.;   Our future sister-in-law (we'll call her Freda)
has announced that she will not help because she never does dishes in other
people's homes. Recently, after a meal for 12, Freda sat in the living room
chatting with the guys while my sisters and I washed dishes and put things
away for over an hour.;   Mom's feet and ankles swell up from being on her
feet too long and I don't think she should have to do dishes in addition to
the cooking. Mom says she'd rather do it than "make trouble." Do you have any
suggestions?;   -- Been Patient in Ohio;   DEAR OHIO -- Since Freda doesn't
seem to care, say no more about her refusal to pitch in -- payback time will
come soon enough.;   Before long she'll be having the gang for dinner at her
place. You women can then sit around in the living room Freda-style and let
her manage with the cleaning as best she can.  </TEXT>

   Centel Information Systems, a unit of Centel Corp. of Chicago, won a $100 million contract to provide automated mail-forwarding equipment to the U.S. Postal Service.

   Postal officials said the new machines, which will be installed in 224 major postal facilities, are expected to save the agency $77 million during their first year of full operation.
Delivery of the equipment is scheduled to begin by the end of this year and be completed by July 1990.

   The new system is designed to reduce the manual handling of mail forwarded to customers who have moved to new addresses.
Last year the Postal Service forwarded 3.2 billion pieces of mail.
The new equipment will automatically apply the correct address and nine-digit ZIP code to letter mail, which will then be sorted by computerized machines.

   It also will automatically print out new addresses and ZIP codes for packages and larger envelopes, but these labels will be applied manually.
Currently, postal clerks must type a code into a computer, which then prints the address label.
Then another worker must place the label on both letters and packages.

   Separately, the agency's Board of Governors approved procedural changes to allow customers to mail materials on a collect-on-delivery basis via overnight Express Mail.
The service will be available July 26, and will allow recipients of Express Mail packages to pay by either cash or check.

   Postal executives this week will be introduced
to a new breed of postal clerk that may never smile, but which also
never frowns or gets cranky or takes a break when there's a line
waiting.
   It's the new face of postal technology _ automated postal clerks
_ and they will begin ``greeting'' the American public later this
summer.
   The clerks, Infopost and Autopost, will be on display at the
U.S. Postal Service's Third Advanced Technology Conference in
Washington this week.
   Infopost, which answers customer questions, already is whirring
away in test form. It will be deployed to post offices in the
Washington area this summer to see how it does in real-life
meetings with the public.
   Autopost, which weighs mail, takes money, makes change and sells
postage, is still being built, although a wooden mockup will be on
display. Field tests of a working model are expected in the fall.
   These are but two of the developments that will be under
discussion at the three-day international conference, where
technical managers will exchange ideas about speeding mail movement.
   Improved mail-handling technology is critical to speeding up
movement of the increasing volume of mail while holding down costs,
explained Kenneth Hunter, senior assistant postmaster general for
management information and research technology.
   Postal officials say the agency needs automation to avoid being
swamped by the 250 billion pieces of mail expected by the year 2000.
   Other developments described by U.S. postal officials at a
preconference briefing last week included machines that can arrange
letters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way, read
ZIP codes and handle a variety of other tasks.
   Teaching machines to read handwriting, for example, is something
technicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment to
find and read ZIP codes and then print a bar code on the letter _
like those black lines used on supermarket items.
   With the bar code, already widely used by business mailers,
letters can be sorted more quickly.
   Other items under discussion will include laser equipment to
help sort mail, automatic truck loading equipment and robots to
move mail containers and do other jobs.
   On hand to see the American work and discuss developments in
their own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries,
including Australia, Canada, West Germany, Britain, Japan, the
Soviet Union, Switzerland and Uruguay.
   While these executives may long for high-speed mail sorters and
cargo handlers, the public face of technology will be embodied in
Infopost and Autopost. People accustomed to automatic banking
machines will likely find the new machinery familiar.
   Infopost offers information on a television-type screen which
the customer touches to enter questions. It can respond either with
an answer or with more questions.
   Asked about rates for overseas mail, for example, the machine
can ask the weight of the item, tell what types of things are
allowed to be mailed to the country in question, and give the rates
and expected delivery time for various mail. It also will print the
information on a slip of paper if asked.
   While Infopost deals with just information, Autopost _ also
using an interactive television screen _ is a mailing station.
   It contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asks
for the destination ZIP code. With that information it outlines
mailing options _ first class, priority mail, Express Mail or
parcel post, for example _ and tells the cost of each option and
how long it is expected to take for delivery.
   The customer can then feed coins, bills or a bank cash card into
the machine, and it will make change and issue a postage-meter-like
strip to be stuck on the letter or parcel. It will also give a
receipt, if asked.
   The item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox.
   While Infopost and Autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbies
of post offices, eventually they could be extended to shopping
malls, supermarkets and other locations, according to postal
managers.
   Each will be connected to a central commuter, which will monitor
the supply of postage and change, and call for a technician if
problems develop. The computer will sound an alert if someone tries
to break into the machines.
   The machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent of
post office customer business, the Postal Service estimates,
freeing clerks for more complex transactions.

<HEAD>Expect 28- to 32-Cent Stamp in 1991, Postmaster General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-class letters will probably cost 28 to 32
cents to mail in three years and could include an 11-digit zip code
by the turn of the century, says the postmaster general.
   Increased automation and other economies at the U.S. Postal
Service will most likely keep price increases for mailing a letter
below inflation after 1991, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said
Monday.
   Speaking at the opening of a three-day convention of major
Northeastern large-volume mailers, Frank said the actual increase
for a first-class stamp by 1991 might be 5 cents, to a total of 30
cents.
   ``I'll point out that 5 cents is a 20 percent increase in three
years, which is more or less the amount that the costs have gone up
over the last three years,'' Frank said.
   The cost of mailing a first-class letter rose from 22 cents to 25
cents in the spring of 1988. An increase in 1991 would continue the
recent policy of increases every three years.
   Frank said that after running a surplus last fiscal year, the
postal service will be hard pressed to break even in the current
year and faces the greatest deficit in its existence, up to $1.7
billion, in fiscal 1990.
   Automation will cost the postal service $4 billion between now
and 1995 but will save having to hire 100,000 workers, he said.
   New machines exist that can scan nine miles of mail an hour and
can spot a bar code anywhere on the face of an envelope, even one
sandwiched into a cluttered address block or placed amid graphics
and colorful designs.
   Scanners now in use at post offices can pick up a bar code only
on the lower right hand side of an envelope, isolated from the
address block and other print.
   Frank said the postal service wants to have nine-digit bar coding
on all mail by 1995 and will begin testing an 11-digit code.
   With the current nine-digit code, the so-called ZIP plus 4, a
piece of mail is automatically sorted to one or another side of a
specific street in a given locale.
   The 11-digit code would sort a letter down to the building
address, in effect stacking the mail in delivery sequence for a
carrier at the destination.
   Businesses that code their own mail would get substantial postage
discounts, Frank said.

   The Postal Service awarded Westing house Electric Corp. a $33 million contract for bar-code sorters.

   The contract calls for the Pittsburgh company's Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group to produce 211 sorters, to be delivered from September 1990 through October 1991.
The pact was the first hardware contract awarded to Westinghouse, the agency said.

   The machines will separate as many as 40,000 letters an hour, sorting them by electronically scanning a bar-code representation of the ZIP code on the face of the envelope.
Sorters separate mail, previously bar coded by business mailers, into 96 channels, according to ZIP code areas.

<DATELINE>RAVENNA, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a young sailor wrote a letter to his
parents during the Vietnam War, he forgot to include the ZIP code.
   That might have made it a little late, but doesn't account for
all 23 years, the U.S. Postal Service says.
   Bert Budai wrote his parents a 2{-page letter filled with
typical adventures of a young sailor during the war. He returned
home in 1969 and his parents later died.
   But the post office delivered the letter Tuesday to Budai's
former home in Ravenna, just across the road from where he now
lives.
   ``I was quite shocked,'' said Budai, now 44, married and
stepfather of two children. ``My sister lives in my father's house
now and it came to that address and she brought it over to me.''
   The letter is postmarked Oct. 17, 1966 _ the same day Budai
penned it aboard the USS Valley Forge, a helicopter carrier
stationed off the Philippines.
   Stamped with an 8-cent air mail stamp, the envelope included
Budai's shipboard return address, in care of the San Francisco post
office. The mailing address lacked the Ravenna ZIP code, but Joseph
L. Johnson, communications manager for the Grand Rapids division of
the postal service, doesn't think that made much difference.
   ``It you don't include a ZIP code it might delay it a couple of
days, but certainly not 23 years,'' Johnson said. ``Of course, we
apologize for the late delivery.''

<HEAD>Mailing A Letter to Cost More on Sunday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   People who have been putting off writing
letters may want to get busy before Sunday, when the cost of
sending one rises to a quarter from 22 cents.
   The 14 percent increase in the price of first-class mail is
less, however, than the 18 percent increase for mailing newspapers
and magazines and the 25 percent increase for advertising mail.
   The rate increases, proposed last May, were designed to avoid
continuing losses by the Postal Service, officials said. The agency
was more than $220 million in the red last year.
   Some 6 billion ``E'' stamps have been distributed to post
offices across the nation to fill the gap until new 25-cent stamps
can be printed. The new stamps, without any price on them, are good
only for use within the country.
   They have no denomination because they had to be printed ahead
of time, before officials knew what new rate would be approved by
the indpendent Postal Rate Commission.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank has ordered post offices to
extend their hours during the next two weeks to help in the
changeover.
   Stamps are also being sold by mail and telephone. Phone orders,
by credit card, can be made by calling 1-800-STAMP24. There is a $2
service charge.
   Here are some examples of the new rates:
   _First-class letters:
   First ounce, 25 cents; additional ounces 20 cents. Up from 22
cents and 17 cents.
   Presorted by ZIP code, 21 cents. Up from 18 cents.

   _Express Mail: Range of $7.75 to $89.05. Down from range of
$8.35 to $104.95.
   _Second-class (periodicals):
   Within county of publication, 9.4 cents per pound and 3.2 cents
to 5.7 cents per piece. Up from 9.1 cents per pound and 3.1 cents
to 4.9 cents per piece.
   Outside county of publication:
   Regular rate, 12.4 cents to 30.2 cents per pound and 4.9 cents

<TEXT>     Installing these two programs is pretty simple.;    If you have regular

6 percent) and it will total up the order, subtracting any discounts or any
amount already paid.;    The evaluation copy of Fastmail Zip, which prints

Katy Carlson lived in Los Angeles, but her mailing address was Torrance. Eight
years ago, that simple anomaly was partly responsible for the death of two
little girls she had hoped to adopt.
</P>
<P>
When Carlson saw Jennifer Dibble, 5, and her sister Joann, 3, at the bottom of
her fenced back-yard pool, she frantically called the operator and was
connected with Torrance police.
</P>
<P>
Precious minutes were wasted while the officer established that Torrance police
could not respond because her house was in the Los Angeles community of Harbor
Gateway. Both sisters drowned, just a few days before Carlson was to sign their
adoption papers.
</P>
<P>
The 911 emergency system has virtually eliminated the likelihood of such
mix-ups today. But Los Angeles officials found the Dibbles' story so compelling
that they told it during congressional hearings this summer that focused
attention for the first time on problems caused by the Postal Service's ZIP
code system.
</P>
<P>
Residents in more than 200 communities nationwide have mailing addresses and
ZIP codes that do not conform to the boundaries of the communities in which
they live.
</P>
<P>
Although some neighborhoods benefit by being able to use mailing addresses of
nearby cities, residents in many others told Congress that they must accept
lower resale values on their homes because of their postal zone. Others said
they pay more for auto and home insurance, a fact the industry disputes.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, people locally and nationally complain about problems in getting
voter material, dog licenses and library cards. Mortgage payments and other
bills inadvertently wrongly addressed are routinely stamped "Return to Sender,"
costing them thousands of dollars in late penalties every year.
</P>
<P>
Northridge homeowners who must use Sepulveda mailing addresses are so fed up
with being associated with that community and its crime and drug problems that
they have threatened to file a class-action suit against the post office to get
a different ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole quality of life issue," said National League of Cities spokesman
Randy Arndt. "There are all kinds of things that ZIP codes get involved with
which can adversely affect a city."
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has defended its method of handing out ZIP codes -- there
are 43,000 nationwide -- saying the system is designed for efficiency and that
it shouldn't have to deal with problems caused by businesses and others who use
it for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
But pressured by bills in Congress and a General Accounting Office audit that
revealed major differences in how requests for ZIP code changes are handled
around the country, postal officials finally agreed this summer to begin
drawing up guidelines to process requests for changes.
</P>
<P>
Holly Park, a community of about 750 homeowners on Hawthorne's east side, is
the first neighborhood that will receive a new ZIP code under the new policy.
Postal officials will be watching how easily the Hawthorne Post Office copes
with the change before approving similar requests from other communities.
</P>
<P>
For years, residents of Holly Park have shared ZIP codes and mailing addresses
with either Los Angeles or Inglewood. Residents west of Van Ness Avenue use
Inglewood 90303 on their mail; those to the east write Los Angeles 90047. To
change all of their mailing addresses to Hawthorne 90250, computers will be
reprogrammed, three mail carriers will be moved to the Hawthorne Post Office
and sorters will have to learn new codes.
</P>
<P>
Under the yet-to-be-completed guidelines, postal authorities will have to
answer requests for ZIP code changes within 60 days, said Tony Conway of the
Postal Service. Postal officials will no longer be able to routinely deny
requests, but instead will have to complete a detailed analysis of the costs
and benefits of a change, he said. The new guidelines will also have provisions
for appeal, he said, although it has yet to be determined how many residents
need to favor a change for the Postal Service to begin the process.
</P>
<P>
Although many municipal leaders hailed the proposal, Arndt said the change
"really does not go to some of the fundamental concerns we have . . . (because)
it still leaves it with the Postal Service to decide whether they want to deal
with this."
</P>
<P>
Although many communities have complained about ZIP code problems since 1986,
when a National League of Cities conference first focused attention on the
problem, Holly Park got to the head of the line largely because of the efforts
of Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), whose district includes Hawthorne,
postal officials said.
</P>
<P>
"He's kept our feet to the fire on this issue," Conway said.
</P>
<P>
Dymally, a member of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee,
co-authored several ZIP code bills last year -- one that would have forced the
Postal Service to realign ZIP codes and mailing addresses to conform with
municipal boundaries and another that would have allowed communities to use
their own names on mailing addresses.
</P>
<P>
The bills, supported by the National League of Cities, would have cost the
Postal Service millions of dollars had they not died in committee, postal
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The administrative remedy appears to be a trade-off between postal and
congressional authorities, although whether Dymally reintroduces one of his
bills next year depends on how effective the guidelines are in dealing with
community complaints, officials said.
</P>
<P>
To gear up for the June hearings on one of the bills, Hawthorne City
Councilwoman Ginny Lambert sent letters to every Holly Park resident, asking
them to write to her about problems caused by their addresses. She brought
letters or messages from about 300 residents when she testified before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
In one letter, aerospace worker Paul Lowe, a 24-year resident of the
neighborhood, estimated that his Los Angeles mailing address costs him about
$1,500 in auto insurance premiums every year.
</P>
<P>
Although he and his wife have clean driving records, they have been quoted as
much as $4,000 a year for auto coverage for their two cars, while friends
across town in similar circumstances pay substantially less, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous what happens to people in this area because of ZIP codes,"
Lowe, 54, said in an interview this week. "If you have a Hawthorne ZIP code,
you pay 50% less."
</P>
<P>
Barbara Doss, a gas company investigator and 20-year resident of the area, said
an insurance agent gave her an $800 quote to insure her car, but when he found
out she lived in Holly Park "he became very, very angry with me, like I was
trying to put something over him, and it came out to $1,500."
</P>
<P>
She said her Los Angeles mailing address has been a constant source of
embarrassment, particularly when she has told someone she lives in Hawthorne.
"You're constantly in a position where people doubt your veracity," Doss, 57,
said. "It makes you look tacky."
</P>
<P>
Holly Park resident Minnie Hadley wrote in her letter that many local voters
were turned away from polling booths in the presidential election because of
confusion over their address.
</P>
<P>
Lynda Roark, 48, complained that she had to pay $50 to retake the X-ray
technician exam because she never received her license renewal form and
inadvertently let it expire.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much the application fee as it was the inconvenience of having to
retake the exam," said her husband, Donald Roark, 49. "It took up half a day to
do it."
</P>
<P>
Communities nationwide have similar problems, according to the testimony.
</P>
<P>
During the hearings, Thornton, Colo., officials complained that last year
$90,000 in sales tax revenue was "either completely lost or had to be
recollected because retailers (mistakenly) paid according to their mailing
addresses rather than their city," Thornton Mayor Margaret Carpenter said in an
interview this week.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Shannon Hills, Ark., complained about having to use a Mabelvale
address, even though there is no town with that name. "One of our biggest
problems is that maps do not show Mabelvale because Mabelvale does not exist,
therefore if you are looking for us by our (post office) and have a state map,
you cannot find us," town officials said.
</P>
<P>
Independence, Mo., officials testified that ZIP code idiosyncrasies have led to
inaccurate census counts, which adversely affects the amount of federal and
state funding they receive for various programs.
</P>
<P>
And others repeated problems associated with higher insurance premiums or lower
home values.
</P>
<P>
However, Mary Crystal, a spokeswoman for the Western Insurance Information
Service, a consumer information group sponsored by insurance companies, said
residents are misled into believing that ZIP codes determine their rates,
though she acknowledges that adjacent ZIP codes can have different rates.
</P>
<P>
A person's insurance rate "has nothing to do strictly with ZIP codes. It has to
do with the territory in which someone lives and the claim costs for that
area," Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
The new ZIP code in Holly Park is "not, all of a sudden, going to magically
change their rates," she said. "It is not likely to have an effect."
</P>
<P>
However, Klaas Bos, governor of the Society of Real Estate Appraisers' Southern
California district, said he has seen ZIP codes make a difference of as much as
10% of a house's value simply because of the "snob appeal" of a better address.
</P>
<P>
"So help me, it shows up that people are willing to pay X dollars more or less
depending on the mailing address and ZIP code," Bos said.
</P>
<P>
Postal authorities remain largely unconvinced that ZIP codes need a nationwide
overhaul. ZIP codes generally conformed to city boundaries when the system was
created in 1963, but often it was more efficient to assign residents the ZIP
code of a neighboring city's post office, which was closer, said Postal Service
spokesman Al Sarro.
</P>
<P>
Widespread changes to make zones match community boundaries are unlikely
because they would be too costly and ultimately would boost stamp prices to
intolerable levels, said officials.
</P>
<P>
"What is a ZIP code about? It's all about sorting mail and getting it
delivered," Conway said. "I don't believe the majority of the American public
would want postal officials to be spending money to adjust ZIP code boundaries
in order to enable individuals to sell their homes for more money."

   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service is moving to speed up the
use of mail with address bar codes, which enable post offices
to use efficient automated equipment.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced several actions
aimed at encouraging business customers to put bar codes on
letter envelopes, large flat mail pieces and even packages.
The agency also said it will send brochures encouraging
mailers to use complete addresses, with ZIP codes on the line
next to the city and state, to the more than 116 million U.S.
addresses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the agency awarded two contracts totaling
$27.2 million for modified equipment that will read address
bar codes almost anywhere on the face of envelopes. Automated
bar code sorters currently in use can only read bar codes
printed in the lower right-hand corner.
   The awards include a $14.2 million contract to
Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, and a $13 million
contract to Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill. Each contract is
for modification of 614 bar code sorters that currently are
being built and for changing an additional 694 sorters
already being used by the Postal Service.
   By 1995, the service hopes to have all letters bar coded
with 11 digits, which narrow delivery to the recipient's
address. It hopes to have 40% of all letters coded by
customers, 40% by post offices and 20% by contractors who do
the coding from remote locations, or using other
technologies.
   Mr. Frank said the agency proposes to begin offering rate
incentives for barcoded letters next June, and to extend them
to all of the nation by three months after that. The service
originally had proposed starting the discounts in 1992, then
moved the plan up to September 1991. While the agency has
proposed that first-class mail be charged 30 cents, up from
the current 25 cents, mailers who bar code letters could pay
as little as 24.3 cents under the rate proposal pending
before the Postal Rate Commission.
   The agency will file for a bar-coding rate discount for
flats, possibly more than one cent per piece, next spring,
Mr. Frank said. It has contracted with several vendors to
develop a flats bar code reader. Finally, the Postal Board of
Governors has approved $52 million for a package bar coding
system to process packages, Mr. Frank said.

Postal Theft
Of Credit Cards

   More people are finding a credit-card bill in their mailbox before they find the credit card.

   Each year, millions of new credit cards are delivered through the mail, often in envelopes hailing the plastic card inside.
That makes the postal system one of the weakest links in the cards' chain of custody, giving mail sorters and letter carriers easy and constant access to a rich vein of plastic gold.

   Last year, postal theft accounted for about $62 million, or 13%, of all credit-card losses, according to H. Spencer Nilson, author of an industry newsletter.
To reduce the number of thefts, credit-card issuers and the postal service are changing the ways they do business.

   Banks that issue credit cards have begun disguising their mailings, even to the point of distributing cards in plain, unmarked envelopes.
"Ours are mailed out in envelopes that don't indicate there's a card inside," says William Buckley, senior executive vice president of Southwest State Bank Association in Dallas.

   And some banks concoct multiple disguises.
First National Bank of Chicago, for instance, is one of the few that periodically alters its mailing envelopes "to help combat the problem," says Peter Soraparu, an assistant vice president.
But the technique is limited by the versatility of a card issuer's envelope-making equipment.

   "Sometimes changing the envelopes is impossible," says Edward Barber, fraud investigations manager for Bankcard Security, the security unit of Marine Midland Bank in New York.

   For its part, the postal service is installing more automated mail-sorting machines -- not just to improve productivity but to reduce the theft of credit cards whizzing through the system, says Al Brown, a postal inspector in Houston.
In the same vein, postal officials are offering reduced mailing rates and taking other steps to encourage use of nine-digit ZIP codes by card issuers.
The codes allow the post office to sidestep manual sorting and, thus, reduce the number of people who have access to mailed credit cards.

   In a more low-tech approach, post offices in Pasadena, Calif., and several other cities have installed overhead catwalks so that postal inspectors can watch employees handling the mail.

   Postal inspectors also watch for clusters of credit cards reported missing in the same ZIP code.
Such a pattern enabled Mr. Brown, the postal inspector, to nab a mail carrier who had stolen several cards and had given them to girlfriends, who racked up $200,000 in charges.
"When it's one (missing card) in a ZIP code, I usually won't react," Mr. Brown says.
"But when it's five or six, it's really obvious."

   No amount of gadgetry and security can remove the temptation of stealing a credit card, which is virtually as good as cash.
Postal workers can easily sell stolen cards in a flourishing black market, where they command a price of at least $250 each, according to security experts.
A member of one credit-card theft ring told a congressional committee in 1983 that the main sources for stolen cards were prostitutes and postal employees.

   Although the thievery involves only a fraction of the service's 800,000 employees, the rate is increasing.
Arrests for internal theft rose about 30% last year, to 753, with most of the publicly reported cases involving credit cards.
Fred Gray, manager of the Internal Crimes branch of the Postal Service in Washington, attributes much of the jump to an increase in the number of postal workers.
But some inspectors see other reasons.

   "Narcotics and greed" are two of the biggest problems, says Mr. Brown, who finds that many wrongdoers are trying to support drug habits.
In more than half the cases caught by postal inspectors, the perpetrators are temporary employees, whose backgrounds aren't checked as thoroughly as full-time workers.
Postal inspectors complain that a government computer system that allows them to check criminal records can be used after they arrest a suspect, but that they aren't allowed to make such checks as a condition of employment.

   "You do have some (employees) with sticky fingers," says Carl Martin, a postal inspector in Houston.
"I know it sounds terrible -- postal workers stealing any mail -- but we recognize that we're all humans."

   On occasion, a case involves a most trusted employee.
A mailman in West Palm Beach, Fla., was honored by the city commission in April for saving the lives of two elderly women who were in a car accident.
Later that week, he was arrested and charged with using a credit card from his mail pouch to buy $110.25 worth of jewelry.
The case is pending.

<P>
The county's General Post Office in Santa Ana found itself under siege Monday,
grappling with double the normal number of cards and letters and packages in
the holiday mail crush.
</P>
<P>
On a normal day, about 1.5 million pieces of mail come through the facility --
officially the Santa Ana Sectional Center -- but Monday 3 million cards,
letters and packages were processed.
</P>
<P>
The 2,400 employees dug in for the barrage of holiday mail like seasoned
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"You know it's coming," said Gladys Quan, 50, a postal worker for 21 years.
"It's not like it creeps up on you."
</P>
<P>
Nearly every piece of mail posted in the county is processed at the facility, a
bustling, noisy postal hub for all but six Orange County cities. On any normal
day, the center's operations are a lesson in controlled chaos. At Christmas,
it's just plain chaos.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the machines worked nonstop, sorting an endless stream of multicolored
envelopes that cascaded down sorting "waterfalls" to waiting mail handlers.
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just the machines that worked nonstop.
</P>
<P>
"We work 12 hours a day, six days a week, and you got your home to take care of
and you got your presents to buy," Quan said. "I hit the malls right after
Thanksgiving."
</P>
<P>
Roberta Kriksciun, 31, of Vista, has also worked long hours, including 12-hour
shifts, seven days a week, in the three weeks immediately after Thanksgiving.
But she, unlike other postal workers, didn't lose any time away from her
husband, Mark.
</P>
<P>
"He works here, too," said Kriksciun, a letter sorting machine operator and a
Postal Service employee for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
Kriksciun's job is to key-punch in the first three numbers of the ZIP code for
every letter that passes before her -- one per second. That's about 500 letters
an hour, amounting to more than 6,000 on a 12-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
"I've done this for so long it gives me time to think," she said. "It makes me
think why we're here six or seven days a week, 12 hours a day. I get a chance
to think of what the meaning of Christmas is. It gives me a real good
perspective."
</P>
<P>
While the increased hours are designed to keep up with the surge of mail, the
long shifts can actually decrease efficiency, according to Bill Fisher, a
superintendent on the afternoon shift.
</P>
<P>
"The workload is heavier," Fisher said. "The employees get a little tired by
the end of the night, so our productivity isn't what is should be."
</P>
<P>
Hector Godinez, the Postal Service's field service director for Orange County,
said productivity can also be affected by factors that even advanced technology
can't handle.
</P>
<P>
"Our bar code readers (devices that electronically cancel stamps) cannot pick
up a colored envelope," he said. "So we're using our old-time canceling
machines that we have to feed by hand."
</P>
<P>
Another problem, Godinez said, is that optical character readers -- electronic
machines that "read" addresses and ZIP codes -- can't read script, which most
people use to address Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
And despite its "neither rain nor sleet" motto, the Postal Service is still at
the mercy of the weather.
</P>
<P>
"If the planes don't land (because of bad weather), the mail doesn't land
either," said Postal Service spokesman Joseph Breckenridge.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HANDLING THE DELUGE
</P>
<P>
Monday was the busiest day of the year for the Santa Ana Sectional Center of
the Post Office, the postal "hub" where mail for all but six Orange County
cities is gathered and processed.
</P>
<P>
Other busy periods, according to spokesman Joseph Breckenridge, are:
</P>
<P>
April 15 -- deadline for income tax returns
</P>
<P>
Mother's Day
</P>
<P>
Week before the opening of school -- Breckenridge says many stores clog the
mails by sending out circulars advertising back-to-school sales.
</P>
<P>
Week after Christmas -- retailers clog the mails with post-Christmas sales
circulars.

<HEAD>Town Gets Mail For Celebrity Residents of LA Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRENTWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town of Brentwood has little in
common with the posh Los Angeles neighborhood with the same name,
and they're more than 350 miles apart. But its post office is the
lost and found for celebrity mail.
   ``We've gotten letters for Sylvester Stallone, Janet Jackson,
Michael Jackson, Betty White, George Carlin, Marcus Allen, James
Garner, Harrison Ford, and Madonna,'' said Laura de Concepcion,
superintendent of postal services in Brentwood.
   That's the Brentwood in eastern Contra Costa County, east of San
Francisco.
   ``We even got one for President Reagan because he has a ranch
down there somewhere,'' she added.
   The post office with a staff of 17 gets nearly 200 pieces of
misdirected mail each day. Many of those letters and packages are
intended for celebrities who live in Brentwood. The neighborhood in
Los Angeles.
   ``It's not funny,'' said postmaster Manuel Vilchez. ``It creates
a lot more work for the Postal Service. It's time-consuming and
probably irritating to the people who send the letters.''
   Most of the letters end up in the town of 10,000 rather than the
L.A. neighborhood because of addled addresses. They either give the
city as Brentwood but use the Los Angeles zip code, 90049, or
indicate a Los Angeles street with the Brentwood (north) zip code,
94513.
   De Concepcion agrees that getting so much mail with the wrong
address gives her and her colleagues extra work. But it has its
good points.
   ``It kind of breaks the monotony of the day,'' she said. ``Every
time we get a letter for a celebrity, we always make a scene about
it. It's very exciting for us.''
   ``I've never had a telephone call from a celebrity looking for
their mail, but I'm waiting,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The new rates proposed by the board of
governors of the U.S. Postal Service would mean higher mail costs
for most individuals and businesses.
   Here are some examples of the changes when the new rates take
effect, probably sometime in early 1991:
   _Individual cost of mailing a letter or paying a bill: 30 cents,
up from 25 cents.
   _Cost to mail a regular post card: 20 cents, up from 15 cents.
   _Price of sending a seven-pound package: $5.06, up from $4.00.
   _Charge to a bank to send a three-ounce statement: 76 cents, up
from 65 cents.
   _Department store cost to mail a pre-sorted bill: 26 cents, up
from 21 cents.
   _Price to send a credit-card bill, sorted according to the full
nine-digit ZIP code: 25.3 cents, up from 20.5 cents.
   _Utility company cost to send a bill with imprinted bar code,
allowing it to be handled by machines: 24.3 cents, up from 20 cents.
   _Lawyer's cost to send one-pound of legal documents by priority
mail: $2.75, up from $2.40.
   _Charge to send eight ounces of high-speed business information
via Express Mail: $9.75, up from $8.75.
   _Cost for two-pounds of urgent business materials via Express
Mail: $13.75, up from $12.00.
   _Postage for a typical weekly newsmagazine: 16 cents, up from
13.5 cents.
   _Cost of sending a somewhat heavier monthly magazine: 37.4
cents, up from 29.7 cents.
   _Postage for two ounces of advertising, with special bar code
imprinted to permit handling by new automated machinery: 16.1
cents, down from 16.7 cents.
   _Rate for half-pound catalog, sorted according to ZIP code: 33.1
cents, up from 27.1 cents.
   _Charge for advertising mail, sorted in advance according to the
sequence of houses that the letter carrier visits: 9.6 cents, down
from 10.1 cents.
   _Cost of sending a local three-pound business package: $2.00, up
from $1.58.
   _Book club cost to mail a four-pound package: $2,26, up from
$1.95.

   A few small alternative magazine delivery systems have popped up
over the last few years, but now one of the industry's heavy
hitters - Time Warner Inc. - has entered the picture.
   The publishing industry says if Time's system prospers, more
companies could follow and eventually provide significant
competition for the U.S. Postal Service.
   ``There's no question what the motivation here is,'' said George
Gross, an executive vice president of the trade group Magazine
Publishers of America. ``By building a distribution system you are
saying to the Postal Service that while there is no alternative
now, in time there will be.''
   The magazine industry has been complaining for years that rising
postal rates have been cutting into their profits. Postmaster
General Anthony Frank has acknowledged that postal rates have
increased beyond general inflation, and he has vowed to slow the
pace.
   But the Postal Service maintains it can do a better job of
delivery than alternative systems such as Publishers Express, for
which Time Warner is the managing partner. Eight other equity
partners are involved in the project.
   Begun in Atlanta last year on a trial basis, Publishers Express
now is delivering more than 100,000 magazines, catalogs and
advertisement packages a month to more than 80,000 households
within five ZIP codes. The company has set a goal of 200,000 pieces
a month to 100,000 households by the end of the year.
   From a suburban Atlanta facility, delivery crews sort 24 titles
- including Time, Sports Illustrated, TV Guide, the Atlantic
Monthly and Playboy - and deliver them in sealed packages before
dawn each day.
   Publishers Express cannot use mailboxes under federal law. The
magazines and catalogs are delivered to doorsteps or left at the
base of a mailbox.
   ``If you look at the magazine business, distribution is the only
cost we don't have control over,'' said Howard Rosen, president of
Publishers Express. ``But it's very tough to tell the post office
you don't like their pricing structure. They'd say, `Fine, but
you've got nowhere else to go.' ''
   Since 1970, Rosen said, the cost for second class postage -
which is the rate for newspapers and magazines - has risen 811
percent compared to a general inflation rate of 209 percent over
that time. Third class postage - the rate for most catalogs - has
gone up 364 percent, he said.
   The Postal Service puts the figures a bit lower: 767 percent for
second class and 247 percent for third class.
   Nonetheless, Rosen said, ``It's too cost prohibitive to
distribute our products through the post office.''
   In addition to titles published by Time Warner, the distribution
service has contracted with other magazines and catalogs to deliver
their products, Rosen said. The titles in the designated ZIP code
areas are automatically distributed through Publishers Express,
though consumers may request that the Postal Service take over
their service.
   Postal Service spokesman Bob Hoobing said costs may be higher
but service is reliable.
   ``The fact of the matter is, we have people who are career
workers delivering the mail. We think we're more reliable,'' he
said.
   Hoobing declined to speculate on the impact of such alternative
delivery services. He said about 6.5 percent of the 161.6 billion
pieces of mail handled last year by the Postal Service was second
class.
   If future postal rate increases continue to pinch, ``there will
be more magazines saying (to Time) we want to join you,'' said
Gross, of the Magazine Publishers of America.
   Kofie Q. Dadzie, an assistant marketing professor at Georgia
State University who specializes in distribution systems, said an
operation such as Time's would have to handle an enormous amount of
material to make its costs competitive with the post office.
   ``I'd be interested in finding the cost analysis that said it
would be cheaper,'' Dadzie said. ``I'm surprised.''
   Rosen declined to disclose Publishers Express' income, but he
acknowledged the distribution system must expand if it is to do the
job of the post office at a lower cost.
   ``Clearly at the scale we're at, we are not in a competitive
price situation with the post office,'' he said. ``We need to
double our volume. It can be reached within the next year or
two.''

<HEADLINE>  JUNK MAIL: DESIRABLE ZIP CODE IS THE CURSE
OF AFFLUENCE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Consumer  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's true. The only way to evade mail you don't want or need -- the
incessant pizza circulars, the environmental spiels, the coupons backed with
unnerving portraits of missing children, the sweepstakes offers from Ed
McMahon -- is to have no address.;    Nearly a third of the mail Americans
receive is classified by the U.S. Postal Service as advertising. If that
fraction sounds low, it's because it's an average figure: Nationwide, 52
billion pieces of third-class advertising mail are delivered every year, out
of a total of 166 billion letters, publications and packages.;    Targeting
ZIP codes; The more money you have -- or people think you have -- the more
solicitations and catalogs you'll receive by mail. If you have no money, and
consequently no address, you can avoid all these complications.;    By
accessing and cross-referencing various data bases, mail marketers are able to
target homes -- especially homes in upscale ZIP codes -- with a vengeance. The
marketers deduce potential customers' spending habits, incomes, occupations,
political leanings and family status (single mom with school kids,
lingerie-prone etc.) from the catalogs they order, the magazines they
subscribe to, the charities they support and the credit cards they hold.;
There is nothing terribly sinister going on -- just smart business, especially
in a recession, when customers are harder to come by. And as the Postal
Service and the direct marketers are quick to point out, millions of Americans
like to shop by mail; millions of Americans actually like junk mail.;    But
even if you demand to be removed from all mailing lists -- as more than
775,000 people did last year, through a program of the Direct Marketing
Association -- it won't matter. The major players in the junk mail business
don't need names, just addresses.;    Advo-System of Windsor, Conn. -- the
ones concerned about the missing children -- sends 18 billion pieces of
advertising a year, much of it to "Occupant" or "Resident." Advo is the Postal
Service's largest private customer, mailing to 52 million households a week.
It maintains an address data base that includes 100 million American
households -- out of 117 million addresses on record with the Postal Service.;
   Fighting to improve their image, mass mailers have launched a campaign
portraying themselves as environmental crusaders, even to the point of
co-opting the revolutionary language of the '60s, when the ecology movement
was born. "Empower consumers in the struggle to protect the environment,"
exhorts a booklet published in December 1990 for members of the Direct
Marketing Association, which represents 3,500 catalog companies, printers,
mailing list brokers and fund-raisers, among others.;    'Meeting a need';
The DMA is encouraging the use of recycled paper, trying to reduce duplicate
mailings, and helping get people off mailing lists by promoting its Mail
Preference Service, which alerts participating list holders and brokers of
names and addresses to purge.;    The Postal Service, which derives 39 percent
of its revenue from third-class mail, offers statistics -- and quotes -- that
endear it to the junk mailers.;    "The mail-order industry is meeting a need
in America or it wouldn't exist," says Art Shealy, a Postal Service spokesman
in Washington.;    The Postal Service's most recent survey, which asked 5,300
households to keep a weekly record of their mail, showed that 60.3 percent of
the respondents said they "do not mind receiving (advertising) pieces in which
they are not interested, as long as they receive some pieces that are of
interest," quotes Shealy, "and 33.6 percent said they wanted less ad mail."
The rest were undecided. The study also showed that 41.5 percent of the
respondents "read completely and immediately the ad mail they received.";
Shealy points out that third-class ad mail volume has been relatively constant
for the past three years.;    "People tend to think they're getting a lot more
third-class mail; it's a perception thing. The perception has changed because
people with higher incomes receive more third-class mail." So it's the yuppie
curse? "That's what you get for being rich and powerful," Shealy says.;    It
could be much worse, of course. You could be living under that freeway.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     For some people, the bundle of advertisements that regularly appears in
their mailbox is nothing but junk mail. It is immediately tossed in the
trash.;   But for many advertisers, direct mail is a godsend. It gets a
message out to a targeted group of people who live near a specific business.
Unlike newspapers, which spread advertisements over a region, direct mail
pieces can go to specific zip codes.;   This saturation advertising can be
very appealing to businesses, especially small ones, said David Stigler,
Advo's attorney in its Hartford, Conn. headquarters. And studies show that 78
percent of American households read the direct mail.;   "I can penetrate every
household within five miles of a store and market research says no one drives
more than five miles for a pizza," Stigler said.;   The Safeway corporation
seems to agree.;   "You're not doing a shotgun approach," said Debra Lambert,
the public relations manager for Safeway's Northern California division.;
The numbers prove the success. While newspapers and magazines have seen their
advertising revenues drop recently, direct mail's profits have gone up,
according to Stigler. The Direct Marketing Association determined in a 1989
study that advertisers spent $34 billion on direct mail in this country in
1989. That translates to about 62 billion pieces of mail a year, or about 540
pieces for each household.;   The concept behind direct mail is simple. The
post office charges a flat rate for all bulk mail under 3.3 ounces. So,
instead of sending one piece of mail, direct mail companies bundle a number of
pieces together and send them for the cost of one piece.;   Getting all the
pieces of paper together is a gargantuan task. The Union City plant, which has
more than 200 employees and serves Northern California, resembles, in part, an
automobile assembly line. Dozens of people line up along sorting machines and
feed in piles of colorful glossies from places like Little Caesar's Pizza or
Levitz Furniture. A quality control person makes sure the bundles actually
hold advertisements from businesses in the area to which they're headed. And
stacks and stacks of paper pile up until they can be carted to the post
office.;   Advo and the U.S. Postal Service work closely together -- so
closely that there are two full-time postal workers on the premises, said Glen
P. Pacek, the vice-president and general manager of the Union City operations.
It's to Advo's advantage, because the post office offers discounts when mail
is sorted a certain way.;   Advo not only sorts the bundles by ZIP code, it
puts the cover cards -- the ones with the pictures of missing children on them
-- in sequence, Pacek said. That way a mail carrier can stuff a bundle into a
mail slot and easily find the address card to accompany it.;   Last year,
Advo, which has 20 facilities in 15 states, spent $1 billion at the post
office, making it the agency's largest private customer, said Dan DeMiglio,
the communications manager for the Oakland Division. Direct mail accounted for
one-third of all the mail the post office delivered and brought in about $10
to $13 billion, he said.;   Not everyone considers the boom of direct mail a
positive thing. The industry has been criticized in recent years by
environmental groups, who complain that much of the paper fills up landfills.
Advo does not use recycled paper.;   But many people don't seem to mind the
uninvited visitors to their mailbox. And occasionally they even use it.;   "It
doesn't really bother me that much," said Michael Cook of Fremont. "I take a
glance at it and throw it away. But once in a while I see something that
interests.";   That's exactly the point, according to Pacek.;   "Everyone you
talk to is going to say 'I throw it away,' " he said. "But they do look
through it. When people say they don't like junk mail, I think they don't like
solicitations (for money.) But I think people like advertisements because it
helps them make good buying decisions."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Scientists Try To Teach Computers To Read</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While computer scientists consider ways to
make Americans more computer literate, a university professor is
trying to make America's computers literate.
   Teaching computers to read involves teaching them to ``think''
like humans - by learning from experience and making educated
guesses. But what most people learn easily at age 6 is proving far
more difficult for computers.
   Humans ``don't just do character recognition. We don't just look
at one thing,'' said Sargur Srihari, a professor at the State
University of New York's Buffalo campus. ``It's going to be many,
many years before computers can read documents such as handwritten
letters.''
   For now, Srihari and his team of about 30 assistants would be
satisfied if the computer could read the addresses on the envelopes
those letters came in. So would the Postal Service, which is
supporting their project with a $2.1 million grant.
   The central post office in Buffalo, for example, must sort up to
3.3 million pieces of mail a night. Its existing equipment could
process up to 42,000 letters an hour - if the addresses were
perfectly printed. But those machines reject more than 30 percent
of the mail as unreadable, said Dennis Wnuk, a postal operations
officer in Buffalo.
   ``Primarily, what our optical character readers can read is
business-type mail, preprinted mail,'' Wnuk said. ``The average
piece of mail that a residential customer will put into a
collection box, we'll only read about 25 percent of those - and
that's only if he prints very well or happens to have a
typewriter.''
   Business mail is also a problem if it comes in a gaudily printed
envelope, if the address is too high, or if it is folded so that
part of the letter shows through the window along with the address,
said John Gullo, an automation and readability specialist at the
post office.
   ``People who use printers, they don't like to change the ribbon
because they want to get every last address out of the ribbon. That
gives us trouble,'' he said.
   The first major problem facing Srihari's team is to find the
address itself - simple for humans, but bewildering for computers
that must separate the address from the ``noise'' on such things as
magazine covers and junk-mail envelopes.
   The SUNY computer zeroes in on text blocks with the proper shape
- those with lines flush to the left, for example - and has already
achieved a 90 percent success rate.
   Next, the computer must figure out as much of the written
address as possible.
   To recognize a `2,' for example, a computer could be taught to
look for ends in the top center and lower right, a curve in the
upper right and a sharp `V' bend in the lower left, said Alan
Commike, a graduate student who is handling the number-recognition
aspect of the project.
   The problem is that there are so many different ways to write
numerals that 130 of those rules are needed to sort them all out.
   ``There are twos with holes,'' or loops instead of points,
Commike said. ``There are fives with hats, fives without hats.
There are British sevens and American sevens.''
   The next step is to teach the computer to make educated guesses
to fill in unreadable blanks. For example, if the street address is
not entirely legible, the computer narrows it to a few
possibilities by matching the part it can read against a list of
all strees and numbers in that particular ZIP code.
   ``This is what is called using contextual information . . .
bringing knowledge to bear, which is what people do,'' Srihari
said.
   Srihari's computers can now read about 75 percent of handwritten
ZIP codes; current postal equipment can read only about 5 percent
of them. But the new process is painfully slow - up to a minute for
each piece of mail.
   Speeding it up will require specially designed hardware, and is
18 months or more away, he said.
   The researchers are testing their equipment with the real thing.
   ``We had a team of undergraduates working nights in the Buffalo
post office,'' Srihari said. ``We didn't delay anybody's mail. We
just took it for a few minutes, captured it and put it in our
database.''
   Eventually, Srihari said, the technology will have a variety of
applications. For example, a busy newspaper reader could feed his
paper into the computer, which would cull out only those stories of
interest to him. Office workers could do the same with memos.
   Similar ``videotex'' systems were never very successful. And the
prediction that computers would eventually create a paperless
office was wrong: if anything, computers have made offices even
more papery.
   Srihari said his project could someday give people the best of
both worlds: they could have their paper and computerize it, too.
   ``People are not going to get away from hard copy. People like
to have hard copy,'' he said. ``It's something tangible. It's nice
to be able to take it somewhere.''

POSTAL SERVICE FACING ITS WORST DEFICIT EVER;
</P>
<P>
BUT OPERATING HOURS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE CUT,
POSTMASTER SAYS

The U.S. Postal Service will suffer its worst deficit ever next year -- more
than $1.5 billion -- but Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank plans no cutbacks
in post office operating hours or delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
Frank said he is confident that an ambitious cost-reduction program, heavily
dependent on automation, can keep the postal system's finances under control
until the next rate increase, expected in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Operating hours at local post offices were reduced from March until September,
1988, generating criticism in many communities. But Frank said that he will not
approve similar measures this year or next despite the fiscal crunch.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do that, absolutely not," Frank said in an interview this
week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Alter Deliveries
</P>
<P>
Saturday service also is sacrosanct, according to the postmaster general.
Reducing deliveries to five days a week "is not a possibility," Frank said.
</P>
<P>
"We handle 530 million pieces of mail a day," he said. "If we cut out Saturday,
we would have to handle a billion on Monday, and we just couldn't do it. We
couldn't deliver them, handle them and store them."
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service is in the final year of its traditional three-year rate
cycle. It will apply next year to the independent Postal Rate Commission for an
overall increase, probably between 15% and 20%. The commission, after lengthy
hearings, will decide on the allocation of higher rates among different types
of mail. New rates will take effect in the first quarter of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The price of a first-class stamp, now 25 cents, would rise to 30 cents if the
rate commission decides on a 20% increase.
</P>
<P>
Losses are mounting as the Postal Service reaches the end of the three-year
cycle because labor cost increases and inflation are exceeding the revenue
increases produced by the last rate increases.
</P>
<P>
The system should break even for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. But fiscal
1990 will produce losses of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, the biggest deficit
since the Postal Service became an independent agency in 1971. The largest
previous loss was $802 million in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The key to Frank's plans for controlling Postal Service costs is increased use
of automation.
</P>
<P>
An extensive automation plan "is more crucial to the Postal Service than
anything else," Frank said. "We want to have a program that fully automates the
mail stream."
</P>
<P>
A vital element is the use of bar codes, the computerized horizontal stripes
printed on some envelopes. They help reduce the number of people handling each
piece of mail.
</P>
<P>
Bar code information goes far beyond zip codes. For example, bar codes can
direct a letter to a specific floor in a big building or to one side of a block
on a residential street. That means fewer hours spent sorting and bundling
mail.
</P>
<P>
About 40% of all letters carry bar codes now, up from 7% at the start of last
year. Frank hopes to encourage businesses to increase the figure to 60% by the
end of next year, and he will make a pitch for automation in his speech Monday
to a conference of major mailers.
</P>
<P>
The inducement will be financial. He said he hopes to raise the discount given
to businesses that use bar codes.
</P>
<P>
The postal service has just developed a machine able to read bar codes through
the clear address windows on business envelopes. When the machines are in
common use, businesses will be able to print bar codes on letters instead of
placing them on envelopes, which is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Increased reliance on automation, combined with a $200-million reduction in
spending by headquarters and elimination of 1,000 management jobs through the
system by attrition, should enable the Postal Service to handle its budget
crunch next year, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for 1990 will be driven by cost-of-living increases and regular
wage increases under labor contracts as well as by a surge in workmen's
compensation claims. The cost of benefits for the Postal Service's
800,000-member work force also is rising rapidly, with health insurance
payments increasing at an unsustainable rate of 30% a year, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
Total hours worked throughout the system will be reduced for 1990, with fewer
part-time employees hired and less overtime for regular workers. In addition,
some 8,000 jobs won't be filled as vacancies occur, Frank said. Normal
attrition is 60,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult Undertaking'
</P>
<P>
"We will operate in the field with fewer hours next year than we did this
year," Frank said. "That is a very difficult undertaking because our volume is
going up."
</P>
<P>
Each year, the system must accommodate an additional 1.5 million to 1.8 million
addresses of new homes and new businesses.
</P>
<P>
Various marketing innovations are being implemented, including the sale of
stamps on an experimental basis through automated teller machines at banks in
Seattle. The experiment will be tested at banks in Santa Ana later this year.

NEW ZIPS IN THE MAIL FOR MANY BOX HOLDERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego area is about to undergo its biggest one-time introduction of ZIP
codes, affecting more than 41,000 post office box holders at 26 post offices.
</P>
<P>
The ZIP codes of people who have mail delivered directly to their homes or
businesses will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
The change, which goes into effect Sept. 1, means that 26 ZIP codes will be
added, 23 in the city of San Diego and three in the rest of the county, said
Postal Service spokesman Mike Cannone. There are now 145 ZIP codes assigned in
the San Diego area, and the last big ZIP code shuffle started Sunday when
Oceanside got five new codes and Escondido got three.
</P>
<P>
Growth and an ever-increasing mail supply have forced the Postal Service to
make these changes. Cannone said 8.3 million pieces of mail are handled daily
in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
"We're running out of numbers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZIP code changes are expected to speed up automated mail sorting, and that
will mean better delivery, said Bill Timms, station manager at the William Taft
Station at 5052 Clairemont Drive, one of the places affected by the change.
</P>
<P>
But postal employees don't expect any real hassles.
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be that much of a problem because we're starting to notify people
now," said Jim Courtney, superintendent at the Poway post office. The change
will affect Poway's 1,218 post office boxes.
</P>
<P>
Cannone plans to barrage the affected post-office boxes with flyers reminding
customers of the upcoming change.
</P>
<P>
"I've worked very hard at reducing the confusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service also has a one-year grace period, so it will honor both the
old and the new ZIP codes during that time, but Cannone said people shouldn't
wait too long to make the change. The grace period gives businesses and other
people affected a chance to order stationery and other supplies printed with
the new ZIP codes.
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service warns that this isn't the last change in ZIP codes the San
Diego area will see. In January, a 919 ZIP code will be added, Cannone said.
ZIP codes in the city start with 921 and in the county with 920.
</P>
<P>
ZIP CODE CHANGES
</P>
<P>
The Sept. 1 ZIP code changes will affect customers who have post office box
addresses at the following 26 facilities:

<TEXT>     But you'd know better than to be so money-oriented with any southern Palo
Altans on your list. They prefer jazz albums.;   East San Joseans wouldn't
want money, either. Cellular phones, downhill skis, pianos and cats -- surely
a likely combination -- are tops on their lists.;   Such is the advice of CACI
Marketing Systems, a Virginia demographics consulting firm billed as the
largest in the world. It brought in $150 million last year mostly by selling
corporate customers details about how specific neighborhoods fit into its 44
categories describing areas of similar likes, dislikes and lifestyles.;   Now
CACI is aiming at the consumer market with a package of information sorted by
ZIP codes, of which there are 36,000.;   One result is the "neighborhood gift
idea report." It's intended to say which gifts are likeliest to be liked,
based on the gifts people in supposedly similar neighborhoods said they buy
themselves.;   "So you can say, 'Gee, what shall I get Aunt Tilly this year?'
And go into the ZIP code and look," said Deborah Wilson, CACI's marketing
information services manager. "It's a way of getting a feel for the lifestyles
around the country and what those mean in everyday items.";   But before you
invest $10 per ZIP code through the CompuServe computer network to fine-tune
your Christmas list, do a little reality check.;   The reports list a canoe as
the most-wanted gift in Willow Glen and Milpitas, although the interest is
said to be twice as strong in Willow Glen. Because of all the lakes and rivers
in central San Jose?;   And ice skates are No. 1 in Sunnyvale and No. 2 in the
Rose Garden neighborhood of San Jose. But they don't even make the list in
Palo Alto, which actually has an ice rink.;   Explains Wilson: "We're saying,
'Here is the probability of enjoying that service.' . . . We don't know if
there's an ice skating rink in your town, but it'll show if your city has a
lot of people like those who enjoy that sport on a national basis. . . . When
we explain the methodology, people understand.";   And so would Aunt Tilly.;

   Pocket Phones Use Light To
   Keep Off Airwaves


</LP>
<TEXT>
   NEW pocket phones communicate by light beams.
   The telephone industry's quest for an inexpensive pocket
phone centers on devices that use the crowded spectrum of
radio frequencies. A tiny Encino, Calif., company has taken a
different tack. Working with GTE's British Columbia Telephone
affiliate, Light Ideas has designed a mobile phone that uses
infrared light. Unlike radio phones, such devices wouldn't be
regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, allowing
a service to be set up quickly.
   The LitePhone sends infrared signals to
transmitter/receivers, called TeleBeams, which are wired to
the public phone network. Special optical filters allow a
caller to use the phone anywhere in a lobby or office without
being cut off; the phone doesn't have to be pointed directly
at the receiver like other infrared devices, such as TV
remote controls. Moreover, LitePhone transmission is broken
down into digital bits and sent in "packets," making
eavesdropping difficult.
   Bell Atlantic plans to sponsor a LitePhone demonstration
next month in Philadelphia for other phone companies, says
George Davis, Bell Atlantic's manager of wireless transport.
He says he tried the phone last month at the MPR Teltech labs
in Burnaby, British Columbia, and "was blown away. The
transmission was crystal clear, and it's so easy to install
that we could start a service next year." The devices need to
be tested, though, with the regular phone system.


   `Palm Tops' Receive Text
   Over a Paging Network


   PAGING may soon mean more than tracking down someone.
   Several companies are readying systems that send text to
the tiniest computers over radio paging networks -- for a lot
less money than it would cost over cellular radio networks.
Hewlett-Packard is combining its 95LX "palm-top" computer
with a new text pager, called Data Stream, from Motorola. The
checkbook-sized 95LX, which is actually an IBM-compatible PC
weighing 11 ounces, can be attached to the Data Stream, which
Motorola says can receive and store as much as 32,000 bits of
data, several pages of text.
   NCR has a notepad computer that can send and receive data
over the Ardis radio network run by Motorola and
International Business Machines, and its Safari laptop is
made to communicate via cellular and paging systems.
   Cue Network is testing an electronic box that works with
the Wizard pocket computer made by Sharp. Cue's box is
installed in a car and stores data that's sent over Cue's
network. Customers can download the data into Wizards as
needed.
   "{Things} will soon get to the point where you can call a
computer by phone and tell it to send information over the
paging network to your hand-held computer," says Stuart
Lipoff, a vice president of advanced electronics at Arthur D.
Little Inc.


   Soon, Homes May Need
   Just Fiber-Optic Cable


   THE DAY gets closer when all communications will come to
the home through one fiber-optic cable.
   Phone companies say that by 2000, customers will have one
phone line of optical glass running to their homes to handle
voice, data and video communications -- even FM radio. Recent
breakthroughs tend to validate the forecast.
   GTE's labs in Waltham, Mass., recently developed a
low-cost method for extending fiber-optic lines from
neighborhood telephone feeder boxes to homes. GTE scientists
etched a tiny chip of silicon with grooves that allow lasers
the size of a pinhead and hair-thin fibers to be mounted
automatically. GTE estimates that a 16-laser package is
one-twentieth the size of today's individually packed lasers
and requires 1% of the time to assemble.
   That's significant because "we have to bring the cost down
to parity with a copper wire system," says Craig Armiento,
research supervisor. He's not sure when that will happen,
though.
   GTE's advance comes about a year after the phone industry
set a strict standard requiring all new fiber-optic equipment
to be built to the Synchronous Optical Network
specifications. This should widen the field of suppliers and
spur construction of "broadband" networks pumping voice, data
and TV to homes.


   Computer Voice Systems
   Help to Sort Letters


   POSTAL WORKERS hope to save money by talking to their
computers.
   About a dozen big postal centers around the country are
installing voice-recognition systems that help sort and batch
letters, even into the mail carrier's bag, says Wayne Nelson,
manager of the engineering technical unit at the Oklahoma
City Post Office.
   Mr. Nelson, whose center sorts mail for 820 postal
stations and offices in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle,
recently began installing the systems made by Verbex Voice
Systems, Edison, N.J. Responding to spoken commands, a
computer at the Oklahoma City center sorts mail sacks
according to ZIP code. The new system uses one operator who
looks at the sack, notes its ZIP code and speaks the number
into a headset microphone using a "normal conversational
speech," says Mr. Nelson. That's quicker than the old system
in which one operator handled the sacks and called out the
number while another worker punched the ZIP code into a
keypad. He estimates salary and productivity savings at more
than $200,000 a year.
   But it's unclear how much the new gear will help cut
overall Postal Service losses, which last year hit $870
million.

BERNSON WILL BACK MAJORITY IN CARVING NORTH HILLS FROM SEPULVEDA
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to rename part of Sepulveda as "North Hills" has gained key support
from City Councilman Hal Bernson, and backers say enthusiasm for the idea is
growing among residents.
</P>
<P>
More than half the 4,000 homeowners in the neighborhood west of the San Diego
Freeway have signed petitions demanding the new name. The effort needs 3,500
signatures to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ribons, a 27-year-old real estate broker and the spokesman for the
secession campaign, said part of the campaign's appeal is that the name North
Hills sounds more prestigious than Sepulveda.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the new name bears little relation to the topography or
location of the area, which lies south of Lassen Street and is as flat as a
chessboard except for the sloping mound on which the Veterans Administration
Hospital stands. "People just think hills are better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the renaming campaign also say that the freeway forms a dividing
line between what they say is the crime-plagued neighborhood of apartments and
businesses to the east and the relatively crime-free neighborhood of mostly
single-family homes to the west.
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who has the authority to approve the name change without consulting
the full Los Angeles City Council, will do so if the majority of the residents
favor it, said Greig Smith, Bernson's chief deputy. In 1987, Bernson joined
Councilwoman Joy Picus to approve changing the name of a section of Canoga Park
to West Hills when residents in the area -- which includes portions of both
Bernson's and Picus' districts -- joined a secession movement started in the
section represented by Picus.
</P>
<P>
"If most of the residents want it, then we're going to give it to them. It's
not a big deal," Smith said. "All you have to do is stand in the middle of the
freeway and look to the left and to the right to know that those are two
totally different communities."
</P>
<P>
Residents who live on the east side of the freeway have no direct say in the
matter, because the freeway divides Sepulveda into two council districts.
Bernson represents the western portion, and Councilman Joel Wachs represents
the east side.
</P>
<P>
No organized opposition to the name change has surfaced, but some residents on
the east have called Wachs' office to express their opposition, said Arline
DeSanctis, one of Wachs' deputies. She said both council offices should have a
say in the decision.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage people to improve the community rather than leave it," DeSanctis
said, reflecting the concern of many who live on the east side of Sepulveda
that those on the west side will abandon community improvement efforts if that
area is renamed.
</P>
<P>
Armando Vazquez, president of the newly formed Sepulveda Coordinating Council,
said the council has not taken a position on the secession movement. But he
chastised proponents of the secession campaign for failing to participate in
community efforts to beautify the area and reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that Sepulveda should remain Sepulveda, and we should
deal with problems and not try to change names and pretend that there are not
problems here for the less fortunate," Vazquez said.
</P>
<P>
But Ribons said the name change would stimulate more community involvement,
including participation in what would be neighboring Sepulveda. He denied that
raising real estate values is a motivation.
</P>
<P>
"If we were really running away from the problems, we would just sell our
houses and leave," Ribons said. "It's just that things have gotten to the point
where people on the west side of the freeway are so frustrated with the name
Sepulveda and the connotations of crime and prostitution that they are closing
themselves in and not getting involved.
</P>
<P>
"The name change would give them some instant pride, and then we'd ask them to
help out in the community."
</P>
<P>
Ribons, who grew up in Sepulveda, said he has spent about $1,000 of his own
money to print petitions and mail them to property owners in the area. He said
organizers decided to conduct a mail campaign, instead of continuing to canvass
door to door, because it is more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Proponents are not seeking a ZIP code change for the area, partly because of
the difficulty in getting the U.S. Postal Service to approve it, Ribons said.
It is commonly believed that ZIP codes are used to determine auto and home
insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
Instead of changing ZIP codes, Ribons said, residents of the newly named
community would probably use the North Hills name and the Sepulveda ZIP code.
Residents on the northern and western edges of Sepulveda's boundaries consider
themselves part of Granada Hills and Northridge, respectively, and often use
those community names with the Sepulveda ZIP code, Ribons said.
</P>
<P>
But John Conte, a Postal Service spokesman, said inconsistencies between
community names and ZIP codes can cause delays in mail delivery.

<LEADPARA>  Postmaster General Anthony Frank said Thursday that the Postal Service would
eliminate 47,000 jobs by 1995 through an ambitious automation program, but he
expressed confidence that the reductions could be achieved by attrition.;
Frank also said that if the first-class letter rate, now 29 cents, is
increased to 30 cents, no further price increases would be needed until 1995.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  POSTAL SERVICE TO CUT 47,000 JOBS
NEW MACHINES WILL SORT MAIL FASTER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The biggest automation program in history" will be virtually completed by
1995, when almost all mail will be processed with a computerized bar code
marked on the envelope for rapid sorting and easy delivery," Frank said.;
The Postal Service has eliminated 37,000 jobs in the past two years through a
hiring freeze, and Frank had indicated in private meetings with union
officials that the organization sought further reductions.;   But Thursday's
announcement was the first public disclosure that the Postal Service planned
to wipe out 47,000 more jobs. The new cutbacks, which will reduce the agency's
payroll to 703,000, will have a direct impact on mail carriers for the first
time.;   These workers now spend about four hours in the office sorting mail
and four hours on the streets delivering it. Automation will cut the time in
the office to two hours. The carriers, with six hours on the street, will be
expected to cover longer routes.;   The automation program should not affect
most individuals sending personal letters and cards. There will be no change
in the current five-digit zip code for addresses.;   The Postal Service is
developing machinery that can read handwriting and hopes to have the device
available by 1995. It would scan the handwritten address at the post office,
and then spray on the envelope a bar code -- a series of vertical lines --
translating the address into computerized language for rapid sorting and easy
delivery.;   The job cutbacks will save the Postal Service $4.5 billion a year
in salary and benefits by 1995, Frank said. The savings should keep postage
costs stable, he predicted.;   The current 29-cent rate for a first-class
letter, in effect since February, was adopted by the independent Postal Rate
Commission over the protests of the Postal Service, which had asked for 30
cents. Frank appealed the decision to the commission, but was turned down
once. He is now awaiting the result of a second appeal. If he is turned down
again by the commission, the Postal Service's own board of governors could
adopt the 30-cent rate by a unanimous vote.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Postal Plan Announced for Contracting Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 12,000 mail sorting jobs at the
post office could be shifted to private companies by 1995 under a
plan announced by the U.S. Postal Service.
   The change could save the mail agency $4.3 billion over 10
years, Assistant Postmaster General Peter Jacobson said Monday.
   He said that hiring private firms to do specific sorting jobs
could cut postal costs by $10 to $12 an hour per employee.
   The announcement, though described as preliminary, comes as the
agency faces contract negotiations with its major unions. The
Postal Service also has a proposal for a rate increase pending.
   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union,
quickly denounced the announcement as a ``disgrace.''
   ``They will do nothing with this but create more hostility, more
upset more apprehension among the workers,'' said Biller. ``We will
fight it on the beaches, on the hill, in negotiations, wherever.''
   Jacobson stressed in his announcement that no current postal
worker need fear for his or her job, although he said it is likely
some will be changed to new duties or transferred to nearby
facilities.
   The focus of the decision is new automated equipment that
permits letters that cannot be read by machine to be viewed on
television screens, where workers can type in the appropriate ZIP
code, allowing the letter to be handled by machinery from then on.
   Test equipment will be installed by Bell and Howell in Nassau
County, N.Y., and by TRW in Louisville, Ky. this fall, with 295
systems planned across the country within three years.
   With the remote video encoding system, the workers typing in the
codes do not have to be in the post office.
   Thus, Jacobson said, contractors will be asked to bid on
supplying workers and facilities and the post office will provide
the equipment. The contracts will be based on bids on sorting
volumes of mail.
   Jacobson said the Postal Service projects that in 1992 the
average postal worker will cost $29.85 per hour, including salary
and benefits. The cost for a workers in a private firm is expected
to be $14.52, he said, with the cost of the building lease and
telecommunications raising it to about $18 per hour.
   The plan is for the sorting contractor to hire people to work
five or six hours daily, mostly in the evening after mail has been
collected and needs to be sorted before delivery, the assistant
postmaster general explained.
   That schedule would also cause problems if postal workers were
used, he said, since they normally work eight-hour shifts.
   While the sorting jobs with a contractor are not necessarily
full-time jobs, Jacobson said the expected mail volume will require
the equivalent of about 12,000 fulltime people.
   The Postal Service now employs about 800,000 workers and annual
attrition is about 20,000, he said.

   What to give Santa Claus, the man who truly
has everything, for Christmas? Why not his own ZIP code?
   So the U.S. Postal Service has done it, giving Santa the ZIP
code of 30351-1989. That's the number boys and girls can use when
they address their letters to the jolly old elf.
   Children always have been able to write to Santa without even
that much of an address, and they still can. The Postal Service has
ways of getting those letters to him, or some of his volunteers
scattered around the country. Somehow, most letters get answered _
often with toys if the child appears needy.
   Now, however, the Coca-Cola Co. is trying to give a boost to the
tradition of writing to Santa and got the postal people to
cooperate with 30351, which happens to be in the Atlanta area where
Coke is and not the North Pole where Santa is.
   To make things easier, the company is putting form letters on
the sides of some of its cartons.
   The soft-drink maker, said Postal Service spokesman Ray Jacobs,
is donating 5 cents for each of the first 2 million letters it
receives to the Marine Corps Reserve's Toys-for-Tots program.
   ``We don't want people to think they have to buy cartons of Coke
to send letters to Santa,'' Jacobs said.

      Portable PC Is Used
   More Like a Notepad
   MAKERS of portable computers fantasize about pads of paper.
They're everything the portable PC should be.
You can use them while you walk around; you can scribble on them in longhand; and when you're done, your friends can add scribblings of their own.

   Now one start-up company says it's found a way to nudge portable PCs toward that ideal.
The company, Linus Technologies Inc. of Reston, Va., calls its machine a "write-top."
Instead of using a keyboard, the user writes on a glass screen with a stylus.

   Linus's machine can convert handwriting into typed text, which can be printed out or transferred to another computer.
First you need to enter your handwriting into the machine, so it can understand your graphological quirks.

   The company expects to start shipping the machine this month.
But don't toss all your pads of paper into the garbage yet.
The machine has some limitations.
You have to pick up the stylus between characters.
The machine also converts handwriting at the sluggish pace of two symbols per second.
And at $2,800 to $3,600, it will cost more than most conventional portable PCs.

   Among those who will market the product is health-care giant Baxter International Inc., an early investor in Linus.
Baxter is testing a version of the computer designed to let nurses keep track of the supplies they use in an emergency room.
The company is developing another version that doctors would use to take notes as they visit hospital patients.

   Software to Improve
   Data-Base Searches
   THE ELECTRONIC data bases of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, a keeper of the nation's bomber planes, contain two billion characters of information in intelligence reports from around the world.

   Piecing together facts from that storehouse is crucial to the military decisions the U.S. makes.
So it's important to be able to rummage through all that data quickly and efficiently.
SAC tackled the problem in an unusual way, which is now becoming commercially available.

   Most data-base search programs ask for lists of key words.
Then they fish out documents that have those words.
Searches can be limited by specifying how close to each other the key words must be, or by listing words to ignore, among other ways.

   Verity Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., developed software for SAC that organizes documents in order of their relevance to a search, based on which key words they contain.
A user can make some key words more important than others by assigning ratings, and the software weights the documents accordingly.

   The need to quickly sort through large amounts of data crops up in other settings, too.
Lawyers are increasingly computerizing huge volumes of litigation documents, but often aren't sure how to comb through them for hidden smoking guns.
Anyone who's ever searched an electronic data base of news articles knows the worry that juicy tidbits are slipping through your net.

   "It's no longer a case that a document fits a search or it doesn't -- there have to be shades of gray," says Clifford Reid, a founder of Verity, which last month unveiled a commercial version of its software.

   Helping Computers Read
   Handwritten ZIP Codes
   WHAT IS a '4'?
And when is it really a '9'?
A team of computer scientists is searching for the answer.
Their work isn't an exercise in Zen philosophy, but it could bring enormous benefits to the world's largest repository of baffling numbers: the U.S. Postal Service.

   The scientists work at the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, a leading center of research in computer vision.
A group at the Ann Arbor-based institute, which normally designs electronic systems for heavy industrial or military work, has a contract from the Postal Service to teach a computer to read handwritten ZIP codes.

   The post office already has machines that can read printed addresses -- used on about 85% of all letters.
But designing an electronic eye for the rest of the mailbag is a thorny task.
"It turns out to be a very hard problem because it's not constrained," says Brian Mitchell, a leader of the Michigan team.
"We don't have the luxury of knowing that a '5' will always look a certain way."

   There are other pitfalls in Mr. Mitchell's path.
Envelopes with printed patterns confuse a computer.
Some people use five-digit ZIP codes and some use nine-digit codes.
Simply finding the ZIP code can be tricky for a computer.

   The Michigan scientists are trying to define numbers by breaking them down into grids of 30-by-30 units, known as pixels.
Even then, they are running into frustrating lookalikes.
One scrawler's '21' passes for another's '4.'
"One or two pixels can make the difference between a '4' and a '9,'" Mr. Mitchell says.

   Odds and Ends
   ART DIRECTORS in advertising and publishing already use personal computers to typeset articles, lay out pages, and make diagrams and drawings.
Soon they'll also be able to fill their screens with photographs.
Comstock, a big New York stock-photo agency, says it will offer the first photo catalogue -- with about 450 photos -- on a compact disk for personal computers. . . .
What will be the top operating system for personal computers in 1992?
Byte magazine posed that question to 5,000 attendees of a recent trade show.
The top vote-getter, with 32%: OS/2, the system inside International Business Machines Corp.'s new line of personal computers.
But DOS, the system inside IBM's previous line, trailed close behind with 30%, suggesting a big chunk of the industry is still resisting IBM's push for OS/2.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Take a phone book, some census data, ZIP codes
and auto registration lists. Add a computer, credit cards and
800-prefix phone numbers and you have the main ingredients for an
enterprise that's one of the wonders of the Western world _
direct-mail marketing as refined, with amazing ingenuity, in the
United States. Here's an intriguing report on how the numbers
magicians do it.

   In the late 1940s, construction of an underpass in Washington,
D.C. effectively sealed off Spencer Howell's novelty shop from the
outside _ and buying _ world.
   To keep on eating, he broke the blockade by placing an ad in
House &amp; Garden offering tubes of whiskey-flavored toothpaste. He
sold 100,000 before the year was out. A bottle opener in the shape
of dentures sold even better.
   Spencer Howell had rediscovered a sales tool as ancient as the
Babylonians: direct mail. Instead of waiting for the customers to
come to you, go to them.
   Some 6,000 to 10,000 catalog retailers _ the figure varies _ do
just that, 11.8 billion catalogs a year, according to trade groups.
They range from titans such as L.L. Bean in Maine to Lands' End in
Wisconsin to Sears, Roebuck and Co. anywhere to Larry Selman in
Santa Cruz, Calif. who sells glass paperweights from a $15 catalog
including a toadstool-shaped antique you can have for $27,000.
   The average American home gets 50 catalogs a year. A burdened
letter carrier delivered 324 catalogs to this writer between last
Labor Day and Thanksgiving.
   Last year 88 million Americans _ 51.2 percent of the adult
population _ bought something by phone or mail. Direct mail has had
a 15 percent annual growth (30 percent for upscale catalogs) since
1970, compared to 5-10 percent for store sales. This is 8.3 percent
of the nation's general merchandise sales. Direct mail is a
high-tech, almost scientific, business which undoubtedly has the
brains to overcome April's 30 percent third class postal hike by
becoming even more so.
   Little of this would have been possible without the computer,
the credit card and the 800-prefix telephone number. And above all,
the mailing list. The mailing list stems from four of the more
mundane items on this part of the planet: the phone book, census
reports, ZIP codes and your car registration.
   Mailing list compilers can get more info from these bare numbers
and names than a Biblical exegete could from the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Donnelley Marketing, one of the big compilers, says it has more
doctors of philosophy interpreting the data than the neighboring
Stamford, Conn. hospital has doctors of medicine.
   Babylonian catalogs came on cuneiformed clay tablets. After
Gutenberg invented movable type, Aldus Manutius of Venice had a
catalog of books he published of Greek and Latin authors. Ben
Franklin _ who else? _ put out a catalog of 600 books in 1744.
American colonials bought everything from lace cuffs to musket
balls by mail from the Mother Country.
   But Montgomery Ward is the direct father of today's direct mail.
His 1872 catalog promised farmers savings of up to 40 percent by
eliminating the middleman for items ranging from harnesses to
parasols. The first compiler was not far behind.
   He probably was Lester Martin, clerk of Story County, Iowa, who
discerned that the registrees of Henry Ford's new tin lizzies were
not only farmers but the wealthier of the breed. Such names might
mean money. Martin got rights to the names and opened the M and F
Mailing Co. with his brother-in-law. Reuben H. Donnelley, another
visionary, bought them out in 1917.
   This vision comes true daily at Donnelley's computer operation
in Lincoln, Neb. There the names and addresses from the nation's
2,700 telephone books are ``laboriously converted to computer
language,'' says Dick Vincent, Donnelley's director of marketing
services. An average directory takes six weeks to computerize.
   But what's in a name?
   Not a whole lot until those computers start comparing notes with
other computers. Census data, for instance, tell how many people
live at a phone address. It gives particulars on value of home,
income.
   The name begins to take on some flesh.
   Compare those results with motor vehicle registrations, compiled
by the R.L. Polk Co. of Taylor, Mich. Two cars at the same address?
Maybe mom works. An RV? Somebody goes camping. Station wagon? Kids.
Sports car? A carefree young in heart if not in fact, a spender.
   Add some input from ZIP. Admittedly these can be misleading,
says Larry Heely, a mailing list executive at Direct Media in Port
Chester, N.Y. The same ZIP code in Chicago contains the wealthy
living in high-rises along the lakefront and the decidedly
unwealthy only a few blocks inland.
   ``ZIPs are not homogeneous,'' says Bill Weisshahar at
Donnelley's computer facility in Nevada, Iowa. So some firms like
Claritas in Chicago dissect who lives where within a ZIP and
divides the United States into 250,000 neighborhoods.
   ``When I got out of college, I moved into an apartment with
orange-crate furniture and tacked posters on the wall for decor,''
says Dave Chambers of Claritas. ``I've moved up and away, but the
new tenant probably still has orange crates and tacked posters.
Birds of a feather flock together.'' All the easier, then, to
identify the flock.
   This computerized database from national sources _ about half
the states will sell vehicle registration lists _ is then
inspected, rejected and detected as closely as a 280-pound woman
discus thrower from behind the Iron Curtain.
   Almost everybody buys mailing lists from everybody else to try
to find out who John and Jane Doe are behind the door at 000 Main
Street, Centerville and just what it is they want to buy. Do they
subscribe to The New Yorker? Upscale. Money magazine? Strong
evidence of loose change. National Geographic? Travelers, armchair
or actual. Field &amp; Stream? And live in rural Colorado? And own a
camper? John and Jane are going to hear from Eddie Bauer and Orvis.
If they buy a sleeping bag and a fly rod, L.L. Bean and Norm
Thompson won't be far behind.
   Word in direct mail, through list renting, moves fast.
   ``It's mind-boggling how many sources of data there are,''
Chambers says. Credit card applications. Mortgage loans. Alumni
directories. Charitable donations. Building permits. Voting lists.
Computers cross-reference all this to draw a profile.

   Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., received a $138
million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to make 614
automated mail-sorting machines, the company's second such
job, as part of the agency's multiphase initiative to
automate sorting fully by 1995 at a cost of $2.5 billion.
   The company said the accord signals its efforts to find
civilian applications for its defense and aerospace
technologies to hedge against defense spending cuts.

<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta's contract is for a new, high-speed
sorting machine that uses barcode technology to process
first-class and third-class mail by ZIP code. The Postal
Service uses bar-code machines to process 51% of its mail;
the remainder is handled manually or with mechanized sorters.
Martin Marietta's Information Systems Group will deliver the
machines by October 1992, with the first delivery expected in
late summer of 1991. It has options to build an unspecified
number of additional machines; they were developed under a
joint licensing pact between Martin Marietta and closely held
National Presort Inc., a Dallas-based technology concern.

<P>
At the gigantic mail-processing center in New Orleans, 22 clerks sit in front
of pigeonholes, the kind used 214 years ago by Benjamin Franklin's office,
slowly examining each letter before placing it into its proper, numbered niche.
</P>
<P>
Mail handlers unload letter trays from trucks, wheeling them inside where
others haul, lift, toss and sort mail all night and half the day.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this scene from the 1950s is an island of innovation, the U.S.
Postal Service's link to the 21st Century: new, electronic sorting machines
that flush 28,000 letters an hour past blinking electronic eyes and into one of
100 steel traps, each representing a carrier's route.
</P>
<P>
But the sorted letters must be picked up again by human clerks and delivered by
human carriers. In the course of being sorted and delivered, a typical letter
is touched by 14 humans' hands.
</P>
<P>
Decades after its first stab at modernizing, the Postal Service -- a
$41-billion-a-year, government-owned corporation with more employees than the
U.S. Army -- has undergone the most expensive, traumatic technological change
in its history. The change has not yet been palpably beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Having poured $526 million into new sorting machines and other technology in
the last 12 months, the Postal Service faces a $1.6-billion loss this year,
declining business growth, lagging worker productivity and raids on its most
lucrative business by private competitors.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to capture the savings dollar-for-dollar that these machines
represent or we can kiss the Postal Service as we know it goodby," Robert
Setrakian, chairman of the Postal Board of Governors, told postmasters in
September.
</P>
<P>
30-Cent Stamp Expected
</P>
<P>
Meantime, U.S. postal patrons can get ready to kiss the 25-cent stamp goodby.
As Postal Service costs continue to rise nearly 1 1/2 times as fast as
inflation, the board is prepared to raise postage rates again in 1991, probably
to 30 cents for a first-class letter.
</P>
<P>
First-class mail delivery performance was at a five-year low last year, and
complaints about late mail rose last summer by 35%, despite a sluggish 1%
growth in mail volume.
</P>
<P>
Automation was to be the service's hope for a turnaround. But efforts to
automate have been plagued by poor management and planning, costly changes of
direction, internal scandal and an inability to achieve the paramount goal of
moving the mail with fewer people.
</P>
<P>
With 822 new sorting machines like the one in New Orleans installed across the
country in the last two years, the post office's total work force declined by
only 1.1%. In the area most affected by automation, mail processing, the worker
pool actually increased by 5,131 people, according to postal figures.
</P>
<P>
Work-force reductions are complicated by union contracts that provide postal
workers with wages and benefits worth about $20 an hour and contain strict work
and assignment rules, strong seniority rights, restrictions on the use of
part-time employees and bans on layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans post office is one example of how poor planning from above and
labor restrictions from below can play havoc with efforts to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
Within an eight-month period, the facility received seven new 60-foot-long
letter-sorting machines, had two others taken away and another four already in
the plant retrofitted with new equipment. To make room, concrete walls were
knocked down overnight and some of the new equipment was used to hold down
still-drying floor tile.
</P>
<P>
Despite drastic decreases in the volume of mail handled, the service had to
hire additional employees: technicians to run the new machines. Postal managers
were unable to lay off people whose jobs were made redundant by technology.
Instead, they transferred employees to areas where there was more work and
adjusted work hours to better coincide with the new mail flow.
</P>
<P>
Morale Plummets
</P>
<P>
The changes affected workers' personal lives and depressed morale. "You're
talking upheaval," said postmaster Charles K. Kernan, general manager of the
New Orleans division.
</P>
<P>
About 550 processing clerks on the late-night shift downtown were told to begin
work at midnight instead of 10 p.m. This meant a 10% pay cut because more of
the shift occurred in daylight hours. The change also made it impossible for
many parents to get home in time to send their children to school.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Cola, who works the letter-sorting machine, said his three children now
must spend the night with his mother-in-law because he gets off later in the
morning. "The kids don't like it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Postal officials in New Orleans also centralized mail processing so they would
have more mail to feed into the machines. As a result, 22 of the 34 manual
clerks in a nearby suburb were forced into the downtown processing center
because there was no work for them elsewhere. They were put in one corner of
the facility where they spend the day under-employed, sorting letters by hand.
</P>
<P>
"The mail is not coming in here so we have to slow down" to avoid looking idle,
said C. J. Roux, a postal clerk. "We don't want to work ourselves out of a
job."
</P>
<P>
The transfer infuriated some longtime employees, who had thought that they
would be protected in desirable jobs because of their seniority.
</P>
<P>
"They shuffled me away like an old piece of furniture," said Alvin Coulon, a
27-year veteran of the post office and one of those transferred to the midnight
shift in New Orleans. "Nobody knew nothing" about the change. "Nobody can do
nothing about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
With more mail being sorted in processing offices, the goal across the country
is to have letter carriers spend more time on the street, with larger
quantities to carry. But some carriers are not happy about that possibility and
they, too, admit to slowing their work pace.
</P>
<P>
"They know the future," Joseph Williams, manager of the Carrollton post office
in a section of New Orleans, said of his disgruntled carriers.
</P>
<P>
Although automation was planned for years, some offices were caught off-guard
when it finally arrived. For example, last fall a planned upgrade of some of
the sorting machines in the main District of Columbia processing center, which
serves Washington, as well as Montgomery and Prince George's counties in
Maryland, caused a drop in on-time deliveries from 93% to 79% because postal
managers were unable to adjust to the temporary shutdown of some equipment.
</P>
<P>
The standard is 95% on-time arrival.
</P>
<P>
The most advanced machine in the current automation plan is called a
"multi-line optical character reader." Its electronic eye can read a five-or
nine-digit typed or printed ZIP code and up to four lines of address. The
machine translates the address or ZIP code into a bar code symbol, which it
sprays on the envelope, then sorts to a particular tray that represents a
carrier's route. Bar code machines read and sort envelopes that contain the
codes.
</P>
<P>
Officials point to San Diego as a model of the way automation should work. The
success there is due largely to the innovative work of local managers who
devised their own strategy for using the machines and, more important, figured
out how to stop the workers from feeling threatened by the change.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a rock in the water," said San Diego division postmaster and general
manager Margaret Sellers. "You start out with a ripple; if you don't do
planning, you get a tidal wave."
</P>
<P>
First, Sellers created an automation team, with five subcommittees to manage
the change and to sell it to employees. When she received the first sorting
machine, she put it on display at a post office open house and then persuaded
union leaders to hold meetings and to walk the workroom floor explaining to
workers what the machines could and could not do.
</P>
<P>
"Our reaction at first was against it," said postal clerk Gary Pattee, an
eight-year veteran. "It was hard to sell it to us because we thought we were
out of here."
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pattee, like other workers, was encouraged to learn how to operate the
mechanical letter-sorting machines, and he was paid for doing it on his own
time. Now his skills and his position are more flexible.
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing San Diego has been insulated from some of the problems experienced
elsewhere because redundant employees are used to handle an increasing volume
of mail. Still, the office has been able to reduce the number of manual sorting
clerks by 10% during the first year of automation.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the U.S. Postal Service is indisputably ambitious. Each day a
work force of more than 800,000 employees in 40,000 post offices and processing
centers across the country flies, ships, trucks and carries an estimated 537
million pieces of mail to 92 million households and 7.3 million businesses.
</P>
<P>
The United States alone produces 40% of all the mail in the world and has kept
the cost of its first-class stamp well below that of every other major
capitalist nation.
</P>
<P>
Postal officials are lobbied by no fewer than 70 industry groups and must
negotiate compensation and working conditions with four labor unions and three
managers' organizations. Once a repository for political patronage jobs, its
relationship with Capitol Hill today consists of 24 annual oversight hearings
before committees in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Its work has been made no easier by constant turnover at the top -- there have
been four postmasters general in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The history of the service's efforts to automate is one that "makes me want to
cry when I rehear it," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
D. H. Shepard first invented an "apparatus for reading" addresses in 1951,
according to records of the Patent Office. A handwritten memoir by Omer M. Long
in the postal archives shows that during the late 1950s and 1960s the then-Post
Office Department had the lead in optical character readers.
</P>
<P>
"We were visited regularly by the foreign engineers trying to learn the state
of the art," Long wrote. "Unfortunately, management . . . changed so often . .
. (or was) totally unsuited for the position . . . that we lost all respect for
lack of performance in the field."
</P>
<P>
Lawrence F. O'Brien, postmaster general in 1965-68, called the post office's
1960s research and development investment "laughable."
</P>
<P>
In 1978, then-Postmaster General William F. Bolger announced the invention of a
nine-digit ZIP code, which made it possible for new machines to read an
envelope and sort it to a particular carrier's route. Reacting to opposition
from commercial mailers and the public, Congress put a three-year hold on the
idea. When the nine-digit code finally became policy, many fewer mailers used
it than predicted.
</P>
<P>
There were other problems as well. In one 18-month period, the Postal Service
gave $25 million in rate discounts to business mailers for using a nine-number
ZIP code that the new machines could process, but then failed to process them
on the machines, according to the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, then-President Ronald Reagan appointed Peter E. Voss to the Postal
Board of Governors. In 1986, Voss pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from a
Michigan lobbying firm for his help in trying to steer a $250-million
sole-source contract for optical scanners to Recognition Equipment Inc., a
Texas firm.
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the Voss scandal set the agency back
18 months in its effort to automate.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms now dominate the field of mail-automating equipment. Contracts
for many of the newly installed machines went to a Texas licensee of a West
German firm, AEG Telefunken.
</P>
<P>
This month, reaffirming its long-term commitment to automation, the Postal
Board of Governors endorsed a five-year strategic plan that will cost more than
$5 billion. Frank has promised to keep costs 2% below inflation, to achieve
historic productivity gains and to increase revenues.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a speedboat here. It doesn't turn on a dime," Frank said in an
interview. "It is changing, it is slow, it is frustrating once in a while, but
so is every large corporation."

<HEAD>Postal Service Preparing Address Correction System for Mass
Mailers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is organizing a nationwide
computer file to help mass mailers keep accurate addresses, but it
won't contain names and poses no threat to privacy, officials say.
   The USA File, for ``universal system of addressing,'' is being
compiled in district postal offices and will be assembled on a
national basis next year, said Dick Strasser, senior assistant
postmaster general for marketing and customer service.
   The Postal Service is banned under a privacy protection law from
compiling lists of Americans' names and addresses. Strasser
stressed that the USA file will not contain any names, and is
merely a system of assuring that street addresses are correct.
   The impetus for the system is increasing automation in the
postal service, which plans to give mailers discounts for letters
sorted in the order that a letter carrier walks his or her route.
   Mailers will be able to take their mailing lists to a
contractor, which will match it with the USA file and provide them
a list of errors, explained Stresser.
   For example, a if a mailer listed someone at 155 Johnson Street,
the USA file could tell them that there is a North and South
Johnson street in that ZIP code, so they need to check for
themselves which is correct for their mailing.

Seeks Rate Rise
Averaging 16%
---
Price of a First-Class Stamp
Would Go to 25 Cents;
Labor Costs Are Cited

By Jeanne Saddler
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service will seek rate increases that would average 16% for all classes of mail and boost the cost of postage for a first-class letter to 25 cents for the first ounce, officials said.

   If approved, the increase would take effect in about a year, and postal officials hope to maintain the new rates for about three years.

   The chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, John Griesemer, said the rising cost of postal operations, labor and retirement benefits will require higher rates by mid-1988.
Under the law, the proposed increase must be reviewed by the independent Postal Rate Commission.
The commission's lengthy hearing process and further deliberation by the board usually take at least a year.

   Postal officials estimated that the increase would cost the average consumer less than 20 cents a week, or less than $10 a year.
The most recent rate increase, raising a first-class stamp to 22 cents, took effect in February 1985.

   Along with the rate increases, the Postal Service proposes changes in its rate structure that would create a new discount for first-class business mail that is partially sorted by customers using computerized bar-codes.
And the agency will ask for new services and a less costly rate structure for its overnight Express Mail Service.

   The rate-increase request comes two weeks after the Postal Service and its unions began negotiations on a three-year contract.
Postal officials yesterday wouldn't disclose what kind of wage settlement they assumed in preparing the rate-increase request.

   "This decision is a financial decision, and it won't affect labor negotiations," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael Coughlin.
He said that while the agency's estimate of its labor costs could, like any other estimate, be off base, the board can delay enactment of a rate increase if it decides the extra revenue isn't needed.

   Leaders of the two major postal unions, however, attacked the board's decision to seek a specific rate increase at this time as a sign that the Postal Service doesn't intend to bargain in good faith.

   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union, and Vincent Sombrotto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the action is an effort to pressure union leaders and lead the public to believe that labor costs are causing postal rate increases.

   Postmaster General Preston Tisch and other officials maintain that several factors, such as increased costs resulting from a new federal retirement system, make a rate increase inevitable.
Mr. Tisch has recused himself from discussions on setting rates for the various mail classifications because the CBS Records division of CBS Inc., in which he has an interest, is a large business mailer.

   Officials said they will formally file their rate request with the Postal Rate Commission this week.
Under the proposal, the rate for first-class business mail that customers partially sort by applying computerized bar-codes -- a new classification -- will be 20.2 cents an ounce.
And for mail on which business customers use the nine-digit ZIP code, the rate would rise to 23 cents from the current 21.1 cents.

   Rates for Express Mail would drop to a range of $7.75 to $70, from the current range of $8.35 to $104.95.
Officials will also seek to offer volume discounts on Express Mail, an improved pick-up service and a reduced rate for parcels weighing eight ounces or less.

   The minimum charge for single pieces of third-class advertising mail would increase to 16.5 cents from 12.5 cents.
The second-class rate, which applies to magazines and newspapers, would increase to 10 cents a pound, from 9.1 cents, for material mailed within the county of publication.
Second-class rates for materials mailed outside the county of publication would drop to a minimum of 10.3 cents a pound from 11.8 cents currently.

Despite the fact that Compton has several ZIP codes, the City Council rejected
an appeal from Councilwoman Jane Robbins to support federal legislation that
would make ZIP code boundaries the same as city boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The city staff backed Robbins' request, saying the inconsistency causes
emergency service confusion and significantly affects apportionment of federal,

resolution and Councilwoman Patricia Moore abstained. Councilwoman Bernice
Woods supported Robbins' motion. Mayor Walter R. Tucker was absent.

Rand and Leslie Hogan have an Anaheim home address -- in Stanton. They are not
alone in this confusion.
</P>
<P>
Tucked into Stanton's zigzagging border, which takes about a dozen jogs into
Garden Grove and Anaheim, are residents who have no idea that they are
official, taxpaying residents of Stanton, according to Mike Bouvier, the city's
planning manager.
</P>
<P>
For convenience's sake, the Postal Service has given these pockets Garden Grove
and Anaheim ZIP codes, even though they are pieces of Stanton. With the ZIP
designations come corresponding Garden Grove or Anaheim mailing addresses,
Bouvier said.
</P>
<P>
The twists and turns of Stanton's boundaries are the result of what Bouvier
called an "incorporation boom" throughout much of Orange and Los Angeles
counties that began in the 1950s. In the decade or so that followed, the
incorporations and land grabs left many area maps looking like patchwork
quilts, he said.
</P>
<P>
About three square miles of real estate became Stanton when it incorporated in
1956.
</P>
<P>
Bad enough that residents are confused. Stanton Mayor Edward L. Allen wanted to
make sure recently that the Census Bureau wasn't. That could cost.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will soon begin its national census. That survey of age, income,
residency and other statistics is the basis for distribution of billions of
federal and state dollars to local communities. The more residents, the more
money.
</P>
<P>
"I's a significant issue," said Rand Hogan, a member of Stanton's Community
Affairs Committee, a group of residents and business representatives appointed
by the City Council to help promote participation in the upcoming census.
</P>
<P>
When a Census Bureau representative recently appeared before the Stanton City
Council to ask cooperation with the head count, Mayor Allen asked how the
bureau intended to sort through the mess created by the city's erratic
boundary. How would the bureau categorize a person who lives and pays taxes in
Stanton, Allen wondered, but whose mailing address is in Anaheim or Garden
Grove?
</P>
<P>
Fernando Tafoya, the Santa Ana district manager for the Census Bureau, assured
the mayor that the system is designed to handle such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Even before census questionnaires are sent to residents, Tafoya said later,
census people canvass communities. Using current city maps, these canvassers
mark the exact geographic location of each residence to pinpoint what housing
is within which city boundary. From this door-to-door survey of "what's
actually on the ground," Tafoya said, the bureau compiles lists that are
cross-referenced to mailing addresses.
</P>
<P>
"When we mail the questionnaires, they go to the address provided," Tafoya
said, but in the tabulation process, the real city of residence is recorded.
</P>
<P>
"We have some other pockets" such as the ones in Stanton, he said. "The
system's set up pretty much to take care of them." PEGGY HESKETH

made up happened to be the zip for Chelsea, Iowa.) The newspaper in Tama
printed my letter and encouraged everyone in the county to write.;    I

you. Keep up the great work, Ann. I have been enjoying your column ever since
I learned how to read.;    -- Sgt. Kevin D. Morgan;    DEAR SGT. MORGAN --
Thanks for the update. It just goes to show what a sense of adventure and a
little creativity can do. Carry on and keep me posted.;    DEAR ANN -- When I
married "Frank," I was pregnant with another man's baby. I let Frank believe
the baby was his. When "Amy" was 3 months old, she was the spitting image of
her natural father. Frank figured it out and divorced me. We agreed that
nothing would be gained by telling Amy the truth.;    A few years ago, Frank
remarried and began his own family. Since then he has seen very little of Amy.
The girl is now 12 and believes Frank is her father.;    She confronted him
last week and asked why he hasn't invited her to spend more time with her
half-brother and half-sister. He later told me that his wife doesn't consider
Amy a part of their family and that she sees no reason for her children to be
involved in the "sordid mess.";    Frank now says if I don't tell Amy the
truth, he will. I don't know what to do, Ann. I hate to see my daughter hurt.
Should I tell her before Frank or his wife does? Or should I keep her away
from them until she's older and can understand life better?; -- Honesty is Not
Always; the Best Policy, the Bahamas;    DEAR BAHAMAS -- After what you've
been through I am surprised by your signature. Surely you now know that your
lack of honesty is what created this unfortunate situation.;    Since neither
Frank nor his wife want to consider Amy a part of their family you have no
right to push the girl on them. You must tell Amy at once that Frank is not
her father. This is sure to be a major trauma for the child, but counseling
could help soften the blow. I recommend it.;    DEAR ANN -- I just read that
the average 18-year-old has seen 13,000 killings and more than 100,000 violent
acts on TV. I find this appalling. What can be done about it?;    --

<TEXT>
   A recent display ad in this newspaper described an appealing new mutual fund.
After reading the copy through twice, I decided to find out more about the fund.

   There was a coupon to be mailed for further information, or, if the reader preferred, an 800 number.
After I dialed the 800 number, a woman answers.

   "I am calling about your ad in today's Wall Street Journal.
I would like more information on your new fund."

   "Are you calling about a bond fund or a stock fund?" the woman asks.

   "I'm calling about your ad in today's Journal -- the new fund described there."

   "Are you calling about a bond fund or a stock fund.
I can't help you unless you tell me which."

   "Well, it appears to be a stock fund."

   No human response.
However, the sounds of telephone switching gear are heard clicking, and in a half-minute another female voice says, "This is Linda.
May I help you?"

   "Yes, Linda, I am calling about the new fund you have advertised in today's Journal. Could you tell me --"
   "What is your zip code?"

   "I'm not sure you'll need my zip code.
I don't know yet whether I want you to send me a prospectus.
All I want is to ask a couple of questions about the fund."

   "I'll have to have your zip code," says Linda.

   She now has my zip code and I resume my quest for information. "What I would like to know," I say, "is whether --"
   "Give me your name," she cuts in.
"Last name first, then first name, then middle initial, if any.
Begin by spelling your last name."

   Further recital of my discussion with Linda is unnecessary.
Suffice it to say she never got my name (first, last or middle initial); I never got the information I was after; and Linda's company will never have me for a customer.

   The point of this anecdote has absolutely nothing to do with poor Linda.
She was doing her job exactly as she believed it should be done.
She correctly surmised that at the end of the day her work performance would be judged on a single factor: The completeness and accuracy of the computer printout she turned in, with each caller's zip code entered on the first line and his last name on the second line.

   Rather, the moral of the story is this: No matter how good the product or how brilliant the marketing plan, it all comes to naught if there is a breakdown at the most critical interface in all of business -- the point at which the customer comes in contact with the company.

   Some executives never seem to grasp this precept.
They assume that the task of attracting customers is strictly a responsibility of the sales department.
Managers of successful organizations, however, recognize that each employee, whether a service technician, an installation mechanic, a receptionist or a parts clerk, personifies the company when he or she comes in contact with a customer.

   When an IBM technician shows up to repair a typewriter or replace an electronic board, in the eyes of the customer that technician is IBM while he remains on the customer's premises.
It is no mere happenstance, then, that IBM technicians, in addition to being skilled in their special area of expertise, are also usually solicitous of customer needs and concerns.
They have been trained to be sensitive to the nuances of customer worries.

   In his book "Further Up the Organization," former Avis President Robert Townsend writes: "When you're off on a business trip or a vacation, pretend you're a customer.
Telephone some part of your organization and ask for help.
You'll run into some real horror shows."

   Good advice.
A friend of mine who is marketing vice president of a major bank decided to follow Mr. Townsend's suggestion.
He had a woman acquaintance call his bank (while he listened in on an extension line) to inquire about obtaining an automobile loan.

   "It was terrible," he says.
"We are a bank.
Making loans is our business, and auto loans are very profitable.
But the woman who made the call to ask about borrowing money for the purchase of a new car was treated with thinly veiled disdain at every step along the way.

   "I don't mind telling you," my banker friend fumed, "that if I had been the prospective customer making the call, and had been treated as that woman was treated, I would have taken my business elsewhere. . . .
We've got some serious attitude-changing work ahead of us."

   Satisfied customers represent the principal intangible asset of any company, regardless of its products or services.
Every working day there are scores of situations in which customers interface with people in the company, from the president on down to the newest file clerk.
Above all else, the manner in which these customer-company contacts is handled determines the ultimate success of the company.

   Your Jan. 8 front-page article on overnight delivery refers to Federal Express Corp. as "the company that invented the overnight-express business" and states that Chairman Frederick Smith "hatched Federal Express because there was no industry."

   The U.S. Postal Service initiated the concept of overnight delivery when it introduced the Express Mail Program.
It was a real disappointment that your entire article noticeably excluded mention of Express Mail.
In addition, Express Mail from the Post Office has offered a money-back guarantee since its inception.

   The article also mentioned that Federal Express translates ZIP codes into its own code numbers.
Your readers will be interested to know Federal uses the Postal Service to mail "overnight" shipments to areas of the country that it absolutely, positively deems too costly to deliver itself.

   While we certainly recognize the quality of service Federal Express and United Parcel Service provide, at the same time Express Mail offers a number of quality options unique to the overnight market.

VA WILL REISSUE 3,200 LOST CHECKS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Veterans Administration on Tuesday ordered reissuance of about 3,200
pension and benefit checks that apparently failed to reach veterans in several
areas of Los Angeles, a spokesman for the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Bill Sawchek, VA regional public affairs director, said the problem affected
recipients in 13 Zip Code areas. Although the March 1 checks were issued by the
VA's disbursing office in Austin, Tex., postal authorities said they did not
receive them for delivery.
</P>
<P>
Sawchek said complaint calls indicated that the problem did not extend to those
checks mailed to banks for direct deposit to veterans' accounts.
</P>
<P>
He said regional veterans' benefits director James Maye ordered duplicate
checks issued for all home-delivery recipients in the 13 Zip Code areas, even
though many of those beneficiaries may not have complained.
</P>
<P>
He advised anyone who receives a second check not to cash it.
</P>
<P>
"Irrespective of who's to blame," said Sawchek, "we decided to go ahead and
solve the problem." In the meantime, the VA and postal authorities were trying
to determine what happened to the original checks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it might take 8 to 10 days for a replacement check to arrive.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The independent Postal Rate Commission
recommended a sweeping series of increases in U.S. postage rates
Friday, including boosting the cost of first class letters to 25
cents.
   But the agency also put forth a proposal to charge consumers
less than a quarter for paying bills and recommended that
advertising mail rates increase by even larger percentages than
other groups.
   The complex series of rate proposals now goes to the board of
governors of the Postal Service, which requested rate hikes 10
months ago. The new rates could be ordered into effect within 10
days to two weeks, with the governors likely to consider the matter
next week.
   Overall, the rate commission recommended a series of postage
rate hikes totaling 17.5 percent, somewhat more than the Postal
Service request for a 16 percent increase.
   The higher rates are necessary for the postal service to avoid a
deficit which could total more than $5 billion by 1989, rate
commission chairman Janet Steiger said.
   The agency agreed with the postal service's original request to
set the rate for first class letters at 25 cents, up from the
current 22 cents.
   At that rate, sending a letter to Aunt Maude would take about
the same bite from the average wallet as it did in 1932. Adjusted
for inflation, the 3 cent postage rate introduced in 1932 would
amount to 25.5 cents today.
   Noting that typical consumers are one of the few groups that
don't get any discounts for bulk mail, the commission made an
innovative proposal to give these people a break.
   It suggested a new courtesy mail discount, in which business
could prepare special envelopes with proper coding and ZIP codes
for automatic processing, and which would be addressed to post
office boxes to save carrier delivery.
   Consumers using these envelopes, for example to pay bills or
respond to an advertisement, would be given a discount on the
postage. The agency didn't suggest an amount of the discount, but
said the Postal Service should study the costs and come up with an
amount.
   The rate commission did recommend a 2 cent cut in the current 7
cent minimum cost for pre-paid business reply envelopes in order to
encourage companies to provide these for consumers.
   In the first class category, the price for each additional ounce
of mail would rise from 17 cents to 20 cents, as requested by the
postal service.
   But the cost for a post card would increase from 14 cents to 15
cents, a penny less than had been requested.
   Overall, first class rates would increase 14.7 percent, the rate
commission said.
   Third class mail, however, which is mostly advertising and is
widely termed ``junk mail,'' would have a 25 percent cost hike.
   The rate commission said in studying costs it determined that
this type of mail was responsible for more postal service costs
than it was paying, and thus should have a larger increase.
   The minimum rate for third class mail would jump from 12.5 cents
to 16.7 cents, slightly more than the postal service had requested.
The per pound rate would rise from 38 cents to 48 cents, 3 cents
more than asked.
   For non-profit advertising mail the minimum rate would increase
from 8.5 cents to 8.7 cents, slightly less than the 9 cents
suggested by the Postal Service.
   Second class mail _ newspapers and magazines for the most part _
would face overall increases of just over 18 percent.
   Newspapers sent within the county would rise to 9.8 cents per
pound and 3.4 cents to 5.9 cents per piece. The current rate is 9.1
cents per pound and 3.1 cents to 4.9 cents per item.
   The commission agreed to a Postal Service proposal for a $8.75
rate for the highly competitive Express overnight mail.
   While some employee retirement costs anticipated by the postal
service turned out to be less than expected, the saving was eaten
up by other amounts, including a poorer than hoped-for showing in
cost-cutting programs, Steiger said.
   When the new rates take effect they will end the prices
structure that took effect Feb. 17, 1985.
   ``Compared to other small necessities we commonly purchase _
from toothpaste to ground coffee _ this is a very modest
increase,'' Postal Board Chairman John N. Griesemer said last May
when proposing the increases.
   He estimated the additional cost of postage to the average
individual would be less than $10 per year.
   The Postal Service is required to break even _ over time _ by
the 1970 law that made it an independent federal agency and ended
the taxpayer subsidy for the mail.
   The Postal Service has been in the black five of the last 10
years. It finished last year with a $223 million loss after showing
a $305 million surplus in 1986.
   A special, nondenominated ``E'' stamp has been prepared for use
when the new rates take effect.
   Because the agency had no way of knowing what rate would be
recommended it had the E stamps printed for use at whatever the
rate turned out to be.
   The E stamps features a space-based image of the Earth and may
be used only for domestic mail.
   Overseas mail rates, currently 44 cents for letters, are not
affected by the new recommendation.

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank moved to
put his stamp on the nation's mail Tuesday, juggling Postal Service
managers and turning his personal attention to technology and
planning.
   ``Change is inevitable. If we are to be successful, the U.S.
Postal Service must anticipate change and manage it effectively,''
Frank told the opening session of the Third Conference on Advanced
Technology.
   Postal managers from around the world convened at the session to
see the latest in sorting and canceling machines, lasers that read
ZIP codes and even automated postal clerks.
   Frank, who brought automated bank tellers to supermarkets and
discount stores when he headed a California savings and loan
association, told the conference that he hopes to do the same for
the postal system.
   ``We plan to locate automated postal tellers in high traffic
areas like shoping malls, transportation stations and large office
buildings,'' he said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Frank, known for his hands-on management style
as a banker before taking over leadership of the Postal Service on
March 1, told the agency's Board of Governors that he is separating
the finance and planning divisions.
   He named Richard J. Strasser as assistant postmaster general for
planning, and said Strasser will report directly to him on projects
for the development and improvement of the agency.
   The Postal Service announced, meanwhile, that it suffered a loss
of $635 million for the accounting period from Dec. 19 to March 11,
above the $586 million deficit it had predicted for that period.
Higher postage rates intended to put the service back in the black
took effect April 3.
   At its meeting, the Board of Governors also disclosed that it
has rejected a proposal to offer a lower ``bill-payer'' postage
rate.
   That idea had been suggested by the independent Postal Rate
Commission. It proposed a discount for people using pre-printed
reply envelopes, such as those for use paying bills, which are
addressed to a post office box.
   Such envelopes do save the Postal Service money, primarily
because they go to a box rather than having to be delivered to a
customer, the board said. But the governors concluded that the
bill-payer rate would be unfair to others sending mail to post
office boxes, since they would still have to pay the full rate.
   In other personnel moves, Frank broadened the Postal Service's
top management by naming two associate postmasters general to work
with him and Deputy Postmaster General Michael Coughlin.
   Kenneth J. Hunter was promoted to associate for systems,
succeeding the late Fletcher F. Acord who died earlier this year.
This includes responsibility for personnel, marketing,
communications, facilities and procurement.
   Edward E. Horgan Jr., who has been in charge of facilities, was
given the newly created position of associate postmaster general
for international affairs.
   Horgan will launch the new job by coordinating the 1989 meeting
of the Universal Postal Union, the international group that
coordinates mail service between nations. It will be the
organization's first meeting in the United States in 92 years.
   Frank, who succeeded Preston R. Tisch as Postal Service chief,
announced that consumer advocate Ann Robinson's duties will be
expanded to include measurement of postal performance.
   In addition, he named Mitchell H. Gordon to head administrative
services and Gordon C. Morison as acting head of marketing and
communications.

   Garlic, normally considered a good way to
keep others from getting too close, has drawing power in these
parts where the 11th annual festival got under way Friday with
150,000 visitors expected for the weekend.
   Highlights include 80 food booths dishing up everything from
garlic-laced vegetarian chili to garlic-flavored ice cream.
   The celebration of the ``stinking rose'' was expected to
generate whooper traffic jams as folks traveled long distances to
sample the delicacies and shop the wares of dozens of artisans.
   For the third year, organizers hoped to reduce the vehicular
nightmare by operating the ``Garlic Express,'' a shuttle train
originating in San Francisco, about 60 miles north.
   But for those who prefer to soar over the crowd of stalled
drivers and fly into the San Martin Municipal Airport, local pilot
Jean Blake, 67, planned to help flyers get to the party.
   ``I'm going to do what I can,'' said Blake.
   Gilroy claimed the title of Garlic Capital of the World when it
threw the first festival in 1979, but an irony of the celebration
is that Gilroy now produces only a small portion of the state's
garlic crop, according to Mike Henry, a spokesman for the
California Farm Bureau.

   Oklahomans have been in a partying mood all
year, the centennial of the state's land run, but folks here have
gone to the extreme of calling a square dance at the post office
just to celebrate their zip code.
   Tuttle's zip is 73089 and Sunday is 7-30-89, so why not dance?
   Postmaster Steve Buchanan and others in the community have lined
up a number of activities for Saturday, since, what-the-heck,
Sunday's meant to be a day of rest.
   An open house and square dancing are planned at the post office
before the official dedication of the building built last year.
Sack races, a petting zoo, buggy rides, a tennis tournament and a
kid's fun run also are planned.
   Buchanan checked up and said Tuttle isn't the only community
that can plan on a Zip code date party as future July 30s roll
around: Union City in 1990, Velma in 1991, Verden in 1992,
Washington in 1993, Wayne in 1995, Weatherford in 1996, Wheatland
in 1997, Wynnewood in 1998 and Yukon in 1999.

<HEAD>Post Office Seeking Ways to Save Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hiring permanent part-time workers and
contracting out some services may have to be considered as ways to
save money in postal operations, Postmaster General Anthony Frank
told a Senate subcommittee Friday.
   Rising health care costs and other expenses are eating up
savings realized through automation, and the massive postal agency
needs to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs,
Frank told the subcommittee on federal services, post office and
civil service.
   ``So far this year, while we still anticipate that revenues will
exceed expenses by a small margin, we have not done as well as we
had planned,'' Frank reported.
   The Postal Service had planned for a surplus this year based on
the 25-cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago.
   Frank has said previously that he expected the agency to drop
into the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991,
maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs every
three years.
   When postal managers applied for the current rates they were
overly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the
``round figure'' of a quarter, Frank told the subcommittee.
   In the real world, costs have exceeded those expectations,
resulting in a smaller surplus than had been hoped for. Also
affecting the postal budget was legislation last year requiring the
agency to contribute funds toward reducing the federal debt.
   Frank told the subcommittee that in order to maintain universal
postal service, and to save money without affecting the current
postal employees, his managers are having to re-evaluate all
operations of the agency.
   ``Maybe we need to look at permanent part-time people,'' he
commented, noting that such workers are common in other countries.
The Netherlands, for example, hires many housewives to deliver mail
four hours per day, Frank said.
   Another possibility is contracting out some work. The Postal
Service currently uses contractors to handle about 15 percent of
its rural routes, and may need to expand that share and consider
hiring contractors for other tasks, Frank said.
   Use of bar codes on all letters by 1995 and other improvements
in automation will help speed the mail and save money, but those
are long-term benefits and not things that will affect the agency
overnight, he said.
   In addition, automation requires a considerable investment,
Frank said. For example, several years ago managers bought machines
designed to read the nine-digit ZIP codes. Those codes were delayed
by Congress and never become popular with the public, so the
machines are now being converted to perform other tasks.
