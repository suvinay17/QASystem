FRANK ZAPPA, CAPITALIST ROCKER;
</P>
<P>
ENTREPRENEURSHIP: ZAPPA GOT TITLE TO HIS MASTER RECORDINGS BY SUING HIS RECORD
COMPANY. NOW HE'S MAKING NON-MUSIC DEALS WITH THE SOVIETS.

Frank Zappa has long been known as a rock 'n' roll iconoclast, an outspoken,
unconventional musician who earned the devotion of a moderate-sized following
with records such as "Freak Out," "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" and "Sheik
Yerbouti." But the former leader of the Mothers of Invention is also a shrewd
businessman. "I don't have anything against making a profit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zappa, who turns 49 on Thursday, always did part his hair differently than his
more commercially successful contemporaries. But this year, while middle-aged
rockers such as the Who, Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones were reaffirming
their popularity on high-profile concert tours, Zappa was smart enough to stay
home. He hung up his road gear after he lost $400,000 on his self-financed 1988
tour.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody got paid but me," he said. Even though the four-month tour of the
United States and Europe was 90% sold out, Zappa said the losses piled up
because of high travel costs and salaries for the 12-piece band. There were 43
people in all, three buses and five trucks. "I had to pay the cost of all the
airplane tickets, all the buses, all the food, all the per diems and salaries,"
Zappa said.
</P>
<P>
"That sort of dampens one's enthusiasm for going out there and doing it again,"
he said, adding that he's unwilling to accept financial backing from a
corporate sponsor because it would mean hawking products such as beer or soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
But Zappa is hardly struggling. Like any other businessman, he's worked at
cutting his overhead and he looks for new business opportunities where he can
find them, some as distant as the Soviet Union. From offices in North Hollywood
and his hilltop Laurel Canyon home, Zappa and his wife of 22 years, Gail, run
several businesses: a record label, a mail-order company, a video company and a
music publishing firm. All the businesses are 100%-owned by Zappa and his wife
and he says they are profitable, although he remains tight-lipped about sales
and earnings.
</P>
<P>
He owns the lucrative master tapes for many of his recordings, thanks to a
lawsuit he filed against his former record company, Warner Bros. Records, and
he slowly re-releases the old titles on compact discs. Much like an annuity,
the money keeps coming from those re-releases. "My stuff sells year after year
and the income from those sales goes to me," Zappa said.
</P>
<P>
It was a few years ago that Zappa and his wife decided to cut their overhead.
They had employed managers, lawyers and accountants to run his music
businesses. "After we started reading the contracts, we started to get smart
and figured out maybe we could do it better," Gail Zappa said. "So I fired
everyone and started over."
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 she has run the business end of things. "He's the artist and puts
the product together. I handle all production aspects of it, the cover art and
packaging. I make all the financial decisions."
</P>
<P>
And lately, the man who produced "Valley Girl," (the 1982 hit he made with his
daughter, Moon, who immortalized a series of Val-slang phrases such as "Gag me
with a spoon") has turned his sights to international trade and is brokering
joint ventures in the Soviet Union, including a proposed deal to start a
U.S.-Soviet business-oriented television show.
</P>
<P>
In the fickle world of pop music, Frank Zappa never achieved superstar status,
though he did have a few certifiable hits. According to Billboard magazine,
Zappa's three biggest singles were "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow," which reached
No. 4 on the charts in 1974, "Dancin' Fool," which hit No. 8 in 1979, and, with
Moon, "Valley Girl," No. 12 in 1982. But the recordings were labeled by
Billboard as novelty songs, meaning "it's like the Singing Chipmunks, more or
less tongue in cheek," said Kim Whitburn, a spokeswoman for Billboard's record
research unit.
</P>
<P>
Zappa, however, concentrates on other numbers. He says artists can make lots
more money by running their own record companies than by collecting royalties
from someone else.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Zappa sued Warner Bros. Records, alleging that Warner used
questionable accounting methods to mislead him about royalties due from sales
of his music, a practice he says is still common in the music business. Most
artists don't take the time to closely scrutinize their contracts with record
companies, Zappa said. But he wanted more control over the sales of his
records.
</P>
<P>
When the suit was settled out of court, ownership of many of the masters
reverted to him. Zappa said he spent about $1.6 million on the suit, but the
steady sales of his old records are very lucrative. "I have albums that were
released 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago that are selling substantial quantities in CD
and cassette," he said.
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. executives declined to give figures on past sales of Zappa's
albums, and they remain touchy about the lawsuit. "I'm not going to deal with
any issue relating to Frank Zappa," said a source at the company, who asked
that his name not be used. "If we say he sold 2 million records for us, he
might come back and sue us for royalties." But the source did say Zappa's
records consistently sold hundreds of thousands of units, which "wasn't huge,
but it was substantial."
</P>
<P>
Zappa releases his new albums on his independent label, Barking Pumpkin
Records, which he started in 1981. "We're taking all the risk a record company
takes," he said. "We have to pay for our own recording, advertising, every
other cost a record company would normally have. On the other hand, all the
profit a record company would normally have is ours now." The records are
distributed through a unit of Capitol Records.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the record company, Zappa also has a licensing deal with a
Boston company, Rykodisc, which has distributed about two dozen of Zappa's old
albums on CD during the past three years. Don Rose, president of Rykodisc, said
that sales of a few of them have topped 100,000 units, a strong showing
considering the recordings are up to 25 years old and that an album goes "gold"
with sales of 500,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Though most of Zappa's income comes from the record business, a growing
offshoot is his Barfko-Swill mail order company, which sells Zappa T-shirts,
posters and postcards, as well as records and cassettes. He also runs a music
publishing business, Munchkin Music; Honker Home Video, a company named after
Zappa's nose and which has produced videos such as "The True Story of '200
Motels,' " based on Zappa's film "200 Motels;" and Joe's Garage, a rehearsal
hall rental company.
</P>
<P>
And after four trips to the Soviet Union in recent few years, Zappa has a
variety of non-music deals he's trying to put together. He's already set up an
agreement for a Chatsworth company to receive amber for jewelry-making from the
Soviets, for which he received a 10% commission.
</P>
<P>
He is also working on starting a satellite-linked television show that would
feature Soviet and American business and legal experts exchanging ideas and
information. He says the cable channel Financial News Network is interested in
the concept, and he has another working trip to the Soviet Union planned for
January. Other joint U.S.-Soviet deals in the works include the possible
manufacture of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Zappa home, where Frank and Gail live with three of their four children and
where much of their business is run, is large but unpretentious. Wood-paneled
rooms are dark and cluttered, and stacks of tapes line the walls. In one part
of the house is Zappa's studio, where he started installing digital recording
equipment in the early '80s, before the technology became a standard for
recording.
</P>
<P>
The studio also contains Zappa's beloved Synclavier, a computerized synthesizer
that can be programmed to produce a vast array of sounds.
</P>
<P>
Zappa was born in Baltimore, but his family moved around a lot because his
father was a civil servant for the military. The Zappas eventually settled in
Lancaster, near Edwards Air Force Base. When he was about 12, Zappa became
interested in drums because he liked "the sounds of things a person could beat
on."
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, while other kids were spending their money on cars, Zappa was
buying records by Igor Stravinsky and avant-garde musicians such as Edgard
Varese. He formed his first band while still in high school. Zappa's first
album was "Freak Out," which he recorded with the Mothers of Invention in 1965.
Since then he has produced more than 50 albums, both with and without the
Mothers.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Zappa went on a tour of another kind when he accepted some
dates on the college lecture circuit. Zappa said the $15,000 per lecture he
earned was practically all gravy -- which rattled him a little since he prefers
touring with a band but can't justify the expense. The businessman explained:
"The interesting thing about lecturing is I make more money sitting in a chair
on a stage for 90 minutes than I do playing in a rock band because there's no
overhead."

<HEAD>Music Makers: Even the Red Army Likes Heavy Metal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN WINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Army's defenses crumbled in the face of
an onslaught of heavy metal music by the West German band Scorpions.
   Not only did security forces relax restrictions so fans could
stand in front of the stage, but the Red Army joined in the
applause at the Leningrad concerts, billed as the first by a major
hard rock band in the Soviet Union.
   ``Every face was saying, `Oh, it's so great,''' lead singer
Klaus Meine said. ``Even the soldiers _ they threw their caps onto
the stage.''
   Meine, who was recently in Miami with the rest of the Scorpions
for a concert to launch their U.S. tour, smiled as he recalled the
band's 10 shows in Leningrad in late April. He said Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's new policies of ``glasnost'' that permit a more
open society made the shows possible.
   ``Musicians there told us this wouldn't have happened one year
ago,'' Meine said. ``But now you have the feeling that you can talk
to everybody about everything.''
   The concerts at the Lenin Sports Concert Complex confirmed the
worldwide popularity of the Scorpions, who have played in such
distant locales as Brazil and Thailand. Every show drew a sell-out
crowd of 15,000.
   ``We thought they were crazy to hold 10 shows in one place,''
bassist Francis Buchholz said. ``I thought by the last show we
would have three people. But people flew in from everywhere, from
Siberia to Moscow.''
   Pop music artists such as Billy Joel have performed in the
Soviet Union, but until recently heavy metal was an underground
genre.
   ``We went into a record store and tried to get some rock music,
and they didn't know what it was,'' Buchholz said.
   He said the Scorpions, whose five members grew up within 100
miles of the Berlin Wall, initially had Soviet authorities nervous.
But the well-mannered band, which relies on catchy melodies rather
than bluster to sell records, wasn't interested in inciting a
rebellion.
   ``Our music is not that aggressive,'' Buchholz said. ``Our
audience doesn't carry chains and knives and stab each other. The
audience is like the music we have _ it's positive.
   ``Drugs are out anyway now. Sex is questionable. So we try to
put some messages into our music.''
   For the Leningrad concerts, Meine and guitarist Rudolf Schenker
composed a new song called ``Living for Tomorrow,'' which is about
taking a chance to improve things. Meine, who sings in English,
introduced the tune at each show by reading the lyrics in Russian:
   ``Evil power won't kill the human race;
   ``If we give life a human face.''
   Buchholz said: ``The audience loved it.''
   The Scorpions, whose new album, ``Savage Amusement,'' is in the
Top 10 in the United States, are now part of the five-band, 25-city
Monsters of Rock tour headlined by Van Halen. The bands performed
at the Orange Bowl on June 4.
   ``We have no problem playing under Van Halen. We respect each
other. It's a great band,'' Meine said. ``At the end of the day we
blow each other off the stage with a smile. ... It's a great way to
come back to America.''
   The group's last studio LP, ``Love at First Sting,'' sold more
than 4 million copies worldwide. The 1985 double LP, ``Worldwide
Live,'' was also a big seller. The Scorpions have had one
double-platinum, two platinum and two gold albums in the United
States, and no other continental European band has approached that
level of sales. Albums are deemed gold when they've sold 500,000
copies, including cassettes and compact discs. Platinum means 1
million copies have been sold.
   Composers Meine and Schenker met in Hanover, Germany, while
practicing with separate bands, and formed the Scorpions in 1972.
When they first appeared in a Hanover band contest, they were
disqualified for being too loud.
   Buchholz joined in 1973, drummer Herman Rarebell in 1977 and
guitarist Matthias Jabs in 1979.
   The theme of physical sexuality has dominated the Scorpions'
album titles and cover art. Their dense sound is built around
Meine's soaring voice and Schenker's piercing guitar lines.

   Former racing champ and auto designer Carroll
Shelby left a Los Angeles hospital in high spirits after a heart
transplant.
   Shelby, 67, was released Friday from Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, where he had surgery June 8.
   ``Everything is fine. It couldn't have gone better,'' hospital
spokesman Ron Wise said.
   Wise attributed Shelby's excellent spirits to his speedy
recovery.
   ``He acted as if it was no more than a tooth extraction,'' Wise
said.
   Shelby lives on a ranch in Pittsburg, Texas, about 120 miles
northeast of Dallas. He was a three-time U.S. sports car driver of
the year and in the 1960s designed the Cobra muscle car, the first
affordable performance car at $6,000.
   Shelby had been suffering from congestive heart failure for
about a year prior to the transplant.

   Gloria Estefan, recovering from a broken back,
wielded a giant bottle of champagne as she christened a cruise ship.
   Ms. Estefan, the singer for Miami Sound Machine, had words of
support Friday for another Miami-based act _ 2 Live Crew. The
popular rap band should not be censored, she said. A federal judge
in Florida this month deemed the group's album ``As Nasty As They
Wanna Be'' obscene.
   ``To an artist and from the artist's standpoint I feel that we
need to have freedom to be able to express ourselves,'' Ms. Estefan
said.
   Ms. Estefan, injured when her tour bus was hit by a truck in
March, says her recovery is progressing and she is passing time by
writing new songs. But she said it will be some time before she
returns to the stage.
   ``I'm at the writing stage now,'' she said.
   Ms. Estefan christened the $200 million cruise ship Nordic
Empress, operated by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. It took her two
attempts to get the bottle of bubbly to shatter.
   At Ms. Estefan's request, Royal Caribbean will donate $25,000 to
the Children's Home Society, which assists abused children.

driving a 1987 Porsche Targa thanks to an idle promise two years
ago from his record producer.
   ``I told Clint, `Kid, you get me a gold record and you can have
my Porsche,''' producer James Stroud said.
   Black's debut album, ``Killin' Time,'' has sold 1.6 million
copies. An album must sell 500,000 copies to go gold.
   Stroud turned over the flashy red set of wheels this week.
   ``I was able to hold off when he went gold, but when he went

Stroud said.

   A local prosecutor Monday declared
obscene the sexually explict ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album by
rap group 2 Live Crew, and banned its sale in Pickens and
Greenville counties.
   The album also has been declared obscene by a federal judge in
Florida, and San Antonio, Texas, store owners pulled it from
shelves last week after they were threatened with arrest. In
Sacramento, Calif., the district attorney Monday refused to
prosecute merchants selling the album.
   Stores will be sent letters about the ruling and must clear the
album off their shelves by June 26 or risk arrest, said prosecutor
Joseph J. Watson.
   ``The whole purpose of the lyrics is to appeal to the prurient
interest of sex. They are patently offensive, and they are utterly
without any serious artistic or literary value,'' said Watson,
summing up the state law's three-part test of obscenity. ``It's
filth.''
   Sale of the album is now banned in communities that comprise
one-fifth of the state's residents. On Thursday, the album was
declared obscene and its sale prohibited in Richland County.
   Anyone found guilty of selling obscene material to a minor faces
a maximum of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. The penalty
for selling to an adult is up to three years in prison and a $3,000
fine.
   To get a conviction, a prosecutor would have to convince a jury
the album is obscene.
   Debbie Bennett, spokeswoman for 2 Live Crew's label, Luke
Records, wondered whether Watson would now look at other material
being sold.
   ``I hope this means they're also taking out all the X-rated
movies and all the other albums on major labels that have all the
same language as 2 Live Crew,'' Ms. Bennett said in a telephone
interview from Miami.
   ``I hope they're not limiting it to a relatively obscure black
group and an even more obscure black label.''
   She said more than 1.7 million copies of the album have been
sold.
   Sacramento District Attorney Steve White Monday rejected
requests to prosecute merchants who sell the album, saying it was
``extraordinarily crude and offensive'' but did not violate state
obscenity law.
   ``To be legally obscene, a work must appeal to prurient
interest, describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and,
taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value as judged against a contemporary statewide
standard,'' White said in a statement.
   Meanwhile in Tennessee, Acuff-Rose Music Inc. sued 2 Live Crew
in federal court, saying the group wasn't authorized to record a
song derived from the Roy Orbison hit ``Oh, Pretty Woman.''
   Acuff-Rose seeks unspecified damages and forfeiture of all
copies of the group's ``As Clean As They Wanna Be'' album, the less
explicit version of the one at the center of the obscenity
controversy, because it contains a rap version of the Orbison hit.

   Controversy over the cover of rock star
Prince's new album, ``Lovesexy,'' on which the singer appears nude
but with his legs strategically placed, doesn't appear to have hurt
sales.
   The album has sold at least 1.6 million copies since its May 10
release even though some record outlets are refusing to sell it,
Prince publicist Robyn Riggs said Monday.
   ``Obviously, it doesn't seem to be hurting,'' she said of the
controversy.
   The album sold 800,000 copies in the first week in the United
States and 800,000 in Great Britain in the first four days, she
said. Sales of the album's first single, ``Alphabet St.,'' were at
least 700,000 in the United States, she said.
   Prince, who lives in suburban Chanhassen, will begin a two-month
tour of Europe on July 8, with a concert in Paris, Ms. Riggs said.
He may follow with a U.S. tour in the fall, she said.

JACKSON BROWNE, HIT BY SAGGING ALBUM SALES, FACES LITMUS TEST
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackson Browne said that, in writing "Enough of the Night," he had pictured
"this imaginary woman," before he realized "the person I was writing to was
me."
</P>
<P>
"You've had enough of the night to fill the street with tears," the song goes.
"You've had enough of those empty hours to last a thousand years."
</P>
<P>
Browne, who turned 40 last year, said that he was writing about a way of life
that included drugs, especially cocaine, which he and his nose have left
behind.
</P>
<P>
He said he wasn't writing about giving up political commitment, the need for
which is the theme of his new album, "World in Motion," which contains "Enough
of the Night."
</P>
<P>
Judging by disappointing sales of "World in Motion," he hopes that an otherwise
loyal following has not had enough of Browne.
</P>
<P>
He'll get a litmus test tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and Sunday night
at the Open Air Theatre at San Diego State University, where he closes his
national tour.
</P>
<P>
Browne's ninth album, "World in Motion," took three years to complete. The tour
that followed its release has been a three-month marathon plagued, in some
cities, by bad weather and bad sales. Almost everywhere he went, however,
Browne's show, which features his reunion with alter ego David Lindley, drew
praise from critics.
</P>
<P>
Browne used the album to make familiar statements about nuclear disarmament,
hunger, racism and the "secret" government that gave rise to Oliver North and
the Iran-Contra scandal. For whatever reason, many critics didn't bite. Some
wrote that Browne is better off as a composer of beautiful ballads than as a
political theoretician. It must have seemed like a bit of a backhanded
compliment when "The New Rolling Stone Record Guide" labeled him "the most
accomplished lyricist of the Seventies." "I'm amazed that some of the things I
talk about on the album are controversial," Browne said backstage before one of
his recent shows. "People don't have to feel personally attacked when someone
raises these questions, when someone suggests that things have got to change.
</P>
<P>
"But the thing that amazes me the most is that this album is not limited to
social issues, even though some critics think it is. I'm writing about peace,
not only in the context of international relations but in relationships, in
love. I think there's a stunning parallel between peace in our own lives and
peace outside our doors. I wanted to make a record that explored the connection
between these things. I wasn't trying to fix anything."
</P>
<P>
Browne said he was disillusioned with media that seem more concerned with
trivia -- such as his relationship with actress Daryl Hannah, or whether he's
listed in "The Andy Warhol Diaries" (he is, on page 23) -- than with the
workings of a shadow government.
</P>
<P>
He said his expectations for the album were "out there," and he was less than
thrilled with its initial reception. He sounded ruffled at Elektra Records for
having "no desire" to release "The Word Justice," the album's most blatantly
political song, as a single. The album's title song was released as a single
but did not do well, and the album reached a peak of No. 45 on the Billboard
magazine album chart a month ago before dropping to 73, 80, and this week to
85.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thomas Noonan, album chart manager for Billboard, said he expects
"World in Motion" to turn around before the end of the year. He said the
album's bad luck says as much about the record industry as it does about
Browne.

"He didn't get off the mark with the right single, and the single is what
drives the album in a promotional sense," Noonan said. "Even so, the album has
sold more than 360,000 copies, and 500,000 is a gold record. It's not a bomb
album, by any stretch. Trust me, it will go gold."
</P>
<P>
But all of Browne's previous albums have gone platinum (more than 1 million
copies sold), so even if "World in Motion" goes gold, it would be considered a
qualified success.
</P>
<P>
Noonan said any album has to be played by radio stations -- and played
repeatedly in its opening weeks -- to be a success. He said the gray area that
Browne and many artists who appeal to the "thirtysomething" generation fall
into is that radio stations "don't quite know where to put them."
</P>
<P>
They're not Hard Rock, and they're hardly Easy Listening or Country, so what,
exactly, are they? Despite the gray, peers and long-time friends of Browne such
as Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley and Phoebe Snow, own albums that have climbed near
the top of the charts in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
No matter the age of the artists or the category they fall into, Noonan said
videos go a long way toward selling records in the 1980s. It doesn't matter
whether they're on MTV or its yuppie counterpart, Video Hits 1, videos sell,
Noonan said. Browne's first from the new album -- "Anything Can Happen," about
the perils of falling in love in a country beset by war -- won't be released
until next week . . . if then.
</P>
<P>
Browne, who's known as a perfectionist, "hasn't approved the video yet," Noonan
said.
</P>
<P>
Television has helped Browne in other ways, as it will any artist who falls
into radio's gray area. Lisa Millman, a spokeswoman for Elektra, said that
sales of "World in Motion" were boosted by Browne's recent appearances on "Late
Night With David Letterman" and "The Arsenio Hall Show."
</P>
<P>
One of the curious problems facing Browne and other artists who are roughly his
age -- and who appeal to crowds in their 30s and 40s -- is that a mob of them
is touring the country this year, pushing new albums. A partial list includes
Ringo Starr, Bob Dylan, the Allman Brothers, The Who, Carole King, Chicago, the
Beach Boys, Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones. Much of their appeal seems geared
to nostalgia, reunions among band members or both.
</P>
<P>
Some of that exists with Browne and Lindley -- "Running on Empty," Browne's
biggest-selling album, was one of the hottest of 1977. Some of the songs from
that album are among the most popular of the current tour.
</P>
<P>
Browne and Lindley say they don't foresee performing together in a live show
with a full band any time soon after this tour. Lindley's fiddle and lap steel
guitar were essentials on every Browne album, from his debut effort in 1972
through "Hold Out" in 1980. Some critics feel that Browne's efforts have not
been as solid since Lindley embarked on a solo career. It is their unusual
chemistry -- Browne's passionate singing fueled by Lindley's instrumentation --
that led Rolling Stone to label the live show "a guaranteed killer."
</P>
<P>
For Browne, tonight's outing at Irvine Meadows will be something of a
homecoming. He grew up in Fullerton, graduated from Sunny Hills High School and
cut his musical teeth at the Orange County folk club, the Paradox. Despite
"Enough of the Night," he remembers nights at the Paradox "as if they were
yesterday."
</P>
<P>
As for critics who don't appreciate his "World," he said with a smile, "This is
what I've served up. It doesn't mean you have to come to dinner . . . although
I'd like it if you would."

<TEXT>
   Nothing she did the past 10 years, Basia says
now, prepared her to become an overnight sensation.
   There was the obligatory dues paying: the years of belting out
jingles for commercials, backing up other vocalists, singing for
Top-40 groups in the United States and England. There was even her
first album, ``Time and Tide,'' that seemed to grow slowly but
surely on a worldwide audience.
   But then came a second hit album, ``London-Warsaw-New York,''
and a frenetic world tour that has turned everything upside down.
   ``It's been traumatic so far,'' the Polish-born pop singer,
whose full name is Basia Trzetrzelewska, said with a giggle. But
it's been a good kind of trauma, the ebullient young woman confided.
   And even a recent bout with a virus that forced her to cancel
two shows on her summer U.S. tour and left her normally languid
voice slightly raspy couldn't dampen her spirits during a recent
phone interview from Chicago.
   ``I'm enjoying this tour so much now,'' she said. ``We really
have a good band. For the first time, every member of the group is
exactly right. Everything just clicked this time.''
   It wasn't always that easy. Becoming an overnight sensation took
a long time.
   It started in the Polish industrial city of Jaworzno, where
Basia grew up listening to Western music, everything from Charlie
Parker to Prince, with Pink Floyd and Carole King on the side.
   She started singing with an all-girl group while still in her
teens, and left for London in 1981 to make a serious stab at a
musical career. Her leaving, she says, allowed her to experience
only from afar much of the economic and political turmoil her
countrymen went through in the 1980s.
   ``I left just before martial law got introduced,'' she said in a
voice that now contains a strong English accent.
   ``Before that, my life (in Poland) was pretty carefree and
careless. I remember that nothing really was missing in my life. We
had enough to eat, we were comfortable. My parents had their own
business producing ice cream. . . . I had my music and my friends.''
   She incorporated everything she heard into her own upbeat style,
one that's heavy on jazz, pop, Latin rhythms and American rhythm
and blues.
   And just after her arrival in London, she met longtime
collaborator Danny White whose musical interests were equally
broad. By the mid-1980s, the two decided it was time to strike out
on their own. But that wasn't easy either.
   ``Danny kept encouraging me to write,'' she said. ``He would
give me a verse and I had to finish the rest of the song.'' It was
something she hated.
   ``To shut him up, I finally just did it, and we wrote a whole
album that way.''
   The album was ``Time and Tide.'' It was her first and quickly
sold 100,000 copies after its 1987 release. The record company was
delighted, but she was disappointed because she was hoping for a
gold record (for 500,000 copies sold). But the LP just kept on
selling, going gold in 1988 and platinum (for 1 million albums
sold) the following year.
   Then everything exploded. ``London-Warsaw-New York'' came out
earlier this year and zoomed up the charts, going gold in three
weeks. The small club dates from the last American tour quickly
became huge concert-hall events. Following this summer's U.S. tour,
there will be concerts in Japan. Then it's back to the United
States in the fall for more shows.
   The success has made her one of Poland's biggest stars.
   ``Now, when I tell my mum something, she's already seen it in
the interview,'' she quipped.
   But her mother hasn't seen her perform in front of thousands
yet. She's only seen her daughter's videos. So there will soon be a
series of concerts in Poland, too.
   ``This is something that is very much on my mind, it's important
to me,'' Basia said. Family also is important, and she returns home
several times a year. ``When I'm there I get so sentimental and
soppy that I just want to cry.''
   In fact, if success has a downside it is that it has kept her
from starting her own family.
   ``This is something I miss the most,'' she said. ``I envy people
who have a stable family life. Career, it's one thing. But it's
nothing compared to that. I really want it badly, and sometimes I'm
afraid I won't get it. I didn't meet the right person yet, I'm
afraid.
   ``But I'm still keeping my eyes open,'' she adds, turning upbeat
again.

<DESCRIPT>  RECORD; PRODUCT; SALE; MUSIC; STORE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A barrage of headbangers, music collectors and fans hungry for the
just-released Guns N' Roses albums overwhelmed two local music stores early
Tuesday morning, buying hundreds of the long-awaited albums -- the group's
first studio work since 1987's "Appetite for Destruction," which has sales of
14 million and counting.;   A line of more than 500 people wrapped itself
around Tower Records in Campbell waiting for a special midnight to 2 a.m. sale
to buy the first copies of the simultaneously released Guns N' Roses compact
discs and tapes, "Use Your Illusion I" and "Use Your Illusion II," at a
discount. Fans heard the first studio tracks from speakers inside the store
while they stood in line.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I've been here since 10:30 p.m.," said one of the first buyers at the
Campbell store.;   Fans waved their albums at those still in line, punched
them into car stereos and left the Campbell store parking lot blaring Axl
Rose's shrill tones over speakers cranked to distortion levels.;   A Campbell
store manager estimated 640 albums were sold in less than two hours. In
Mountain View, 460 albums were sold and the store took in about $5,500. Most
of the action at both stores was in the first half hour.;   "It's the biggest
crowd I have ever seen go through this store in 30 minutes," said Bret
Mitchell, manager of the Campbell store.;   Fans have called the stores for
months about the long-awaited albums. With the recent release of the albums'
singles, "You Could Be Mine," the theme song from the movie "Terminator 2,"
and "Don't Cry," along with the controversial and often-violent national tour,
fans have been more persistent than ever.;   Local Tower Records stores opened
their doors at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, a minute into the final and long-overdue
release date. As a bonus, Tower lowered the price of the two-CD set to $22
until 2 a.m., when doors closed and prices went back to $11.99 per album.;
"We knew there would be fans here, but we weren't prepared for a crowd like
this," said Melissa Wong, a supervisor at the Mountain View Tower Records.;
One of the most popular items was the rare vinyl copy of the two-album set.
The Campbell store sold all of its 30 sets Tuesday morning.;   "They were
picked up right away by collectors who had no intention of opening them,"
Mitchell said. "If we had thought of the collector value those would have, we
would have tripled our order.";   The only one not surprised at the huge
demand for these guaranteed mega-hit albums was Geffen Records, the group's
label, which shipped a record 2 million copies of each album to more than
1,000 record stores nationwide.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; PROFESSIONAL; PROFILE; RECORD  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Julian Lennon, one of rock's most famous sons, knew that going into music
wouldn't be easy.;   People listened to his first album, released when he was
21, because of who he was. But critics told him he was no John Lennon, and he
became both bitter and insecure. He was naive about the business. He slipped
into abusing alcohol and drugs. Sales fell progressively on his second and
third albums.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WITH 'HELP,' JULIAN LENNON PROVES HE NEEDS NOBODY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  This article has been retyped for the data base.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Now he says he's learned how to deal with it, and he wants to tell others
who have dug themselves into a hole that there is a way out: "Help Yourself."
It's the name of his new, fourth album on Atlantic Records, and it reflects
his new outlook on life.;   A big part of helping yourself, Lennon says, is
being yourself.;   "I had plenty of being called an amateur in the past," he
says. "I tended to listen to critics, which really screwed me up. I sort of
lost my self-esteem and everything else in there.";   He released his first
album, "Valotte," in 1984, four years after his ex- Beatle father was shot to
death. Some critics jumped on it, but the album sold platinum (a million
copies) and he went on a concert tour.;   But "The Secret Value of
Daydreaming" in 1986 only went gold (500,000 copies), and Lennon began his
personal slide.;   "I really did trash myself," he says. "I lost faith in
everybody I was working with. I was depending on everybody. I felt they all
let me down. I didn't think they were interested in me as a person. I was
young, naive and gullible.;   "They just got what they wanted out of me and
left me to the wayside to a degree. After the second album, I said, 'Where's
all these friends I'm supposed to have here?"';   In 1987, he says, he took
refuge in drugs and alcohol.;   "When I looked in the mirror one day, I looked
like I was going to die. I said, 'What's going on? I can't allow this. Why am
I feeling this way? Why have I let these people affect me? I'm even putting
myself down for being who I am."';   "I pushed myself way back," he says. "No
one else was going to do it for me. If I wanted to push ahead personally or
businesswise then I had to get out there and make my own changes.";   Lennon
says he found some enlightenment from trying psychotherapy for about a month,
but thought he could work out his problems on his own. "I'd get a piece of
paper and write good things about life and bad. I'd work one problem out after
another.";   He made a third album, "Mr. Jordan," in 1989, allowing himself a
little influence from the Beatles.;   On "Help Yourself," Lennon says, "I
finally decided that I have to allow myself to be myself, which includes
having those influences which are quite a big part of my life.";   The first
song he wrote for the album was "Listen," its first single. "I was angry at
everything and myself because I had been so ignorant about so many things.";
"Rebel King," he says, is about shooting down a kind of rebel inside himself.
"Before this album I was a very shy person, very bitter and angry, with a
smile on the outside. It was this insecurity I've called a rebel.;   "Anytime
I started to become happy in life, something inside of me would say that I
can't have a good life; this is too good for me. I'm teaching myself, yes, I
can have a good life.;   He wrote the song "Help Yourself" last and said he
found it easy: "I had sorted things out by then.";   "To help yourself you've
got to keep hope alive, follow that dream, keep pushing and don't give up. You
must do that or the world is going to swallow you up. That's why the album was
titled 'Help Yourself.' It shows I'm still here and pulled myself through
this. It can happen to you.";   Lennon says there was one down side to the
intensity of creating those songs -- he and his girlfriend split for four
months. He says he learned from that, too.;   "Making the album, I was more
married to (producer) Bob Ezrin than to my girlfriend," he says. "Because of
the pressure I was putting on myself to try to do my best, I was losing touch
with what the most important thing is. That's having someone you love, having
a partner in life."  </TEXT>

   Paul McCartney will be ``Back in the U.S.S.R.''
with a new album and a radio call-in show, but without the hit song
from The Beatles' ``White Album.''
   The former Beatle will answer questions from Soviets in a live
phone-in radio program to be broadcast to the Soviet Union on Jan.
26, the British Broadcasting Corp. said Monday.
   McCartney's appearance follows the November release of his new
album. ``Back in the U.S.S.R.,'' produced exclusively for
distribution in the Soviet Union. The album does not contain the
song of the same name recorded by The Beatles.
   Bootleg copies of the album have made it into the West, selling
for $100 to $250 a copy in the United States and for as much as $885
in London, The New York Times reported last week. In the Soviet
Union, the first batch of 50,000 copies sold for 4 rubles each,
about $6.60 at the official rate.
   The owner of a record store in New York's Greenwich Village that
specializes in collectable records said Monday that he sold two of
the albums before the holidays for about $100. The owner, who asked
that his name not be used, said he obtained the records from someone
who was traveling in the Soviet Union.
   McCartney, 46, said in a statement that the record ``was my
response to glasnost, and I'm looking forward to having a chat with
my Russian fans, courtesy of the BBC.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher chatted long-distance to Soviets
last July during a similar program. She took 15 calls on topics from
glasnost to her household chores.

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: WILLIE'S SONG -- Fans who want to help Willie Nelson erase his
multimillion-dollar tax bill can purchase his recently released "Who'll Buy My
Memories? (The IRS Tapes)."  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  CELEBRITY; MUSIC; FESTIVAL; TAX  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Since Willie Nelson's "Who'll Buy My Memories? (The IRS Tapes)" went on sale
in June, it has sold only 160,000 copies. Under Nelson's unusual arrangement
with the government, the collection of 25 songs must sell at least 4 million
copies if it is to erase the singer-songwriter's tax obligations.;   "You got
to be positive," Nelson said in a telephone interview last week. "It's not
unheard of. I could sell 3 million albums. I've done it before."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  AS WILLIE SINGS, IRS HOPES FOR BIG-MONEY HIT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     He hopes sales will improve when the collection is available in music
stores; it is sold now only through phone orders advertised mostly on
late-night television.;   When Nelson was served last year with a $32 million
bill for delinquent taxes -- one of the largest ever presented to an
individual -- it seemed unlikely that anyone, even the cowboy heroes of his
country and western songs, could rescue him.;   But after months of
negotiation with the IRS, Nelson made a deal that allowed him to bring out the
collection -- yours, for a limited time only, for $19.95 (plus $4 for shipping
and handling) by dialing 1-800-IRS-TAPE.;   The collection includes 25
examples of Nelson's Texas twang and acoustic guitar. The plan is to apply at
least 15 cents from every $1 of sales to the musician's back taxes.;
Laurence Goldfein, Nelson's business manager, said $9.95 of every $19.95 goes
to the telemarketing company that is doing the distribution and marketing;
about $2.40 goes to Sony Corp., Nelson's record company, and $1.60 to other
expenses.;   Pieces of the pie; Nelson's cut is $6. Of that, $2 will go toward
taxes he will owe on the recording's expected profits. Three-quarters of what
is left, or $3, goes to the IRS to satisfy the delinquent tax bill, and the
remaining $1 goes into a war chest to pay for the $45 million lawsuit Nelson
filed last year against his former accountants at Price Waterhouse, whom he
contends put him into ill-advised tax shelters.;   "It'll sell a lot better
once it hits the stores," Nelson said.;   Valerie Thornton, an IRS
spokeswoman, sought to play down the unusual aspects of the arrangements with
Nelson.;   "We try to work with taxpayers, not just Mr. Nelson," she said.
"And if we have to come up with some creative payment plan, that's what we're
going to do, because it's in everyone's best interest.";   "I thought they'd
be crazy not to take it," Nelson said. "The very fact they see a way to make a
lot of money real quick made them go for it. They're not interested in sitting
around waiting 10 or 20 years for the money to trickle in.";   In November,
the government seized Nelson's homesteads in three states, padlocked his
recording studio and arranged to auction off his gold records and the family
piano.;   By then, the government had agreed to take about $15 million less
than it originally wanted, but the 58-year-old singer and songwriter was
having trouble coming up with cash.;   Running out of patience, the government
confiscated almost everything but his talent and his beat-up Martin guitar.;
The ailing real estate market in Texas meant the sales of Nelson's property
reduced his debt by less than $2 million. That left Nelson with a seemingly
insurmountable $15 million obligation.;   But Nelson persuaded the IRS's
district office in Austin, Texas, which is handling his case, to make a major
concession in May.;   Tapes squirreled away; It granted him access to 35
years' worth of seized tapes that he had squirreled away in his Spicewood,
Texas, recording studio. Out of that trove, Nelson created "Who'll Buy My
Memories? (The IRS Tapes).";   "I think it's the best stuff I got," Nelson
said.;   Nelson, considered a country music icon, made his reputation as a
maverick and a songwriter. In the early 1960s, his "Night Life" became Ray
Price's theme song, and "Crazy" was a hit for Patsy Cline (and, years later,
for Linda Ronstadt).;   While he also recorded as a singer, his grainy voice
did not fit the increasingly slick style of Nashville productions, and in the
1970s, Nelson moved back to Texas and began recording with more homespun
backup.;   He also began to make "concept albums," in which songs were linked
to tell stories, and in 1975, he released "Red-Headed Stranger," an album
about a traveling preacher that became a million-seller and ushered in a wave
of Texas-based "outlaw" country music.;   "The Outlaws," a sampler with
Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Tompall Glaser and Jessi Colter released in 1976,
also sold a million copies. And in 1978, Nelson released "Stardust," an album
of pop standards that also became a million-seller.;   Open about tax woes;
Nelson said he had no qualms about making his tax problems a prominent part of
the pitch. "It's been all over the scandal sheets. So why not take advantage
of all that advertising?" he asked.;   Despite the hasty effort to produce and
market the album, Nelson indicated that he was not letting the tax bill take
over his life.;   "There are more serious problems in life than financial
ones, and I've had a lot of those," said Nelson, whose lyrics draw on a
turbulent youth, three failed marriages and a period of professional drifting.
"I've been broke before and will be again. Heartbroke? That's serious. Lose a
few bucks? That's not.";   According to the Recording Industry Association of
America, only two of Nelson's four dozen previous albums sold more than 3
million copies: "Stardust" and "Always On My Mind.";   But Nelson has a
reservoir of good will that he can dip into, especially among farmers who
remember the Farm Aid concerts he helped organize in the 1980s.;   "If I
didn't like his music, I'd still buy the CD to help him because of the help
he's been to the farm organizations," said Benny Bunting, a mushroom grower in
Oak City, N.C.  </TEXT>

   Roger Whittaker is a sales wonder. In 25
years, he has recorded 43 albums and sold 30 million LPs worldwide.
   One single record alone, ``The Last Farewell'' in 1978, sold 11
million copies.
   ``It's staggering, astonishing,'' said the 53-year-old Whittaker
in a telephone interview from Germany. ``I face it as it comes
along. It's great to know you can do it. If you think about it, you
get a swelled head.''
   His top-selling albums in the United States are ``The Best of
Roger Whittaker'' and ``All My Best,'' both nearing sales of 1
million. Many of his records are sold through TV marketing,
including ``Best Loved Ballads'' and ``All Time Heart-Touching
Favorites.''
   He has just released for over-the-counter sale another album,
``I'd Fall in Love Tonight,'' produced in Nashville. It includes
country music standards like ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,''
``There Goes My Everything'' and ``Have I Told You Lately That I
Love You.''
   The singer-songwriter-guitarist now records for Universal
Records after 19 years and 19 albums with RCA. Singing in three
languages _ English, French and Spanish _ has widened his appeal.
   Whittaker also has gained a larger audience through hawking his
albums on TV. Universal Records thinks he's someone who can get
consumers to buy records at the retail level rather than just
picking up the phone and dialing the number shown on the TV screen.
   ``We're looking forward to adding to our collection of gold and
platinum albums,'' said Jimmy Bowen, Universal president.
   Whittaker is a star in North America, Europe, Australia and
various points in between. One Nashville record store recently had
four different Whittaker albums and five different compact discs.
   ``I can go anywhere,'' he said. ``It's a wonderful feeling. I've
made 10 tours of Canada. We did better business on this 10th tour
than any one we've done.''
   Singing love ballads and not making drastic changes in style
have helped him do well, he said.
   ``I've stayed in the style and never tried to conform to
convention. I've sung the kind of songs I write even when out of
vogue. Fifteen percent of the record-buying public buy my kind of
music. I've stayed faithful to that core of people.
   ``Every once in a while a song comes along that every one takes
to, like `The Last Farewell,''' he said.
   He described ``The Last Farewell'' as ``a happy marriage of
lyrics and melody.''
   ``It was number one in places like Finland where they don't
speak English,'' said Whittaker. ``They still play it in Russia, so
the tune must have a lot to do with its success. The
English-speaking nations identified with the chorus, `For you are
beautiful and I love you dearly.'
   ``The lyrics were emotive to me and I identified with them.''
   In his writing and singing, Whittaker looks for songs that
express realism.
   ``If I can relate to what a person is saying, then I sing it.
Like `Downtown' or `The Last Farewell.' If it reflects something of
my own experience, then I sing it.''
   Whittaker, born in Nairobi, Kenya, now lives in London. He has a
degree in biochemistry from the University of Bangor in Wales.
   ``I did become a biochemist,'' he said. ``But I wanted to go
into the entertainment business to get it out of my system. The
more I got into it, the more I fought to succeed.
   ``The less I succeeded, the more I fought,'' he said. ``It
became a real mania for me. My father threatened me about getting
the right job. When I finally found success, he came around a bit.''
   Apart from his recording and concert tours, his TV special,
``Roger Whittaker in Kenya, a Musical Safari,'' was shown by the
British Broadcasting Corp., and in the United States by the Disney
Channel on cable TV.
   He is active in efforts to help save Africa's black rhino,
donating proceeds from program sales at concerts and recording
royalties to a trust fund to create sanctuaries for the rhino in
Kenya.

The debate over whether the lyrics of a recording by the million-selling rap
group 2 Live Crew are obscene moved to a higher level today with the issue's
first airing in federal court.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine if "As Nasty as They
Wanna Be," which has been removed from store shelves in several Florida
counties, should also be banned in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
The county ordered the ban. Lawyers for the Miami-based group then asked
Gonzalez to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
Three of the group's four members -- David Hobbs, whose stage name is Mr. Mixx;
Chris Wongwon, known as Fresh Kid Ice, and Mark Ross, who performs as Brother
Marquis -- were present for the trial's start.
</P>
<P>
Leader Luther Campbell was expected later, said Debbie Bennett, a spokeswoman
for the group's record company.
</P>
<P>
The album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" has sold nearly 2 million copies, while a
toned-down version of the album has sold about 300,000 copies.

</P>
<P>
POP: CHARLES FREEMAN LEFT A BROOKLYN GHETTO TO GET AWAY FROM 'A LIFE OF CRIME.'
NOW HE FACES A YEAR IN JAIL IN FLORIDA FOR SELLING A 2 LIVE CREW ALBUM.
</P>

<P>
Thanks in large part to the national obscenity controversy surrounding the
Miami rap group 2 Live Crew, the group's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album has
sold more than 2 million copies -- earning the Crew's leader, Luther Campbell,
approximately $6 million.
</P>
<P>
And making him a national celebrity.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 of the "Nasty" albums were sold at E.C. Records, a tiny store in
nearby Ft. Lauderdale -- earning its owner, Charles Freeman, about $3,000. And
putting him in line to become, possibly, the first person in the United States
to go to jail for selling obscene music.
</P>
<P>
While Campbell is touring the country with 2 Live Crew and promoting his recent
solo album, which has sold more than 500,000 copies, Freeman is back home
facing up to a year behind bars.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just an average guy, trying to make a living," he said by phone from his
store. "I don't drink or smoke or do drugs."
</P>
<P>
For weeks now, Freeman has been worrying about a Friday court date during which
he was to be sentenced by a Broward County judge -- not knowing when he kissed
his wife and four children goodby whether he would be returning home.
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, Judge Paul L. Blackman approved a motion granting the retailer a
Nov. 16 hearing to allow his attorney to argue for a new trial and a judgment
for acquittal. The decision meant Freeman's sentencing would be postponed until
after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The action may have only postponed his agony.
</P>
<P>
"This bust has totally disrupted my life," Freeman said after hearing Wednesday
of the postponement. "I couldn't sleep last night. My business has been
crippled. My wife and kids are upset and my ulcers are about to kill me. I
vomit after every time I eat."
</P>
<P>
The irony, Freeman said, is that he left "a life of crime . . . running with
gangs" in his native Brooklyn, N.Y., and moved to Florida to pursue a
legitimate career after his mother warned that he was going to end up in jail.
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined I'd be about to go to jail for selling a record," he said.
"I'm just trying to earn an honest living down here. No judge should be allowed
to dictate what kind of music an adult can listen to."
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 32, was arrested June 8 for selling a copy of 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty
as They Wanna Be" to an adult undercover police officer two days after a U.S.
district judge in Ft. Lauderdale ruled that the record violated a Florida
obscenity statute.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of selling obscene material on Oct. 3 by an all-white jury and
faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
Freeman said he has been selling albums by 2 Live Crew and other "even more
sexually explicit" rappers, along with a small stock of gospel, comedy and
R&amp;B records, since he opened his mom-and-pop shop in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Nobody in the black, middle-class neighborhood where he rents the
800-square-foot storefront ever complained, he said, until anti-obscenity
crusader Jack Thompson initiated a campaign against the "Nasty" album in
January.
</P>
<P>
"2 Live Crew's 'Nasty' album was dead and buried before Jack Thompson came
along," Freeman said. "He gave it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and brought it
back to life. Thompson was unemployed before he got into this obscenity thing.
Now he's out there trying to earn money on the lecture circuit debating about 2
Live Crew."
</P>
<P>
Thompson, in the middle of 30-stop college campus tour, was unavailable for
comment. But Det. Eugene McCloud of the Broward County Sheriff's Department,
the officer who arrested Freeman, said the record-store owner has no one to
blame but himself.
</P>
<P>
"It's like some guy stealing crack cocaine in the streets saying, 'Hey, I dare
you to do something about it,' " McCloud said. "Well, eventually a guy like
that tends to draw attention to himself. The only reason Mr. Freeman was
arrested was because he openly defied the law."
</P>
<P>
Still, people in the Brooklyn neighborhood where Freeman grew up do not view
him as a criminal. One of six children reared in a welfare-recipient family,
Freeman quit the gang he ran with in 1977 to move to Ft. Lauderdale. He worked
as a maintenance man, a porter and a street deejay before opening his store.
</P>
<P>
His aunt, Mary Alice Freeman, said Freeman's relatives and childhood friends
support him "110%" in his free-speech battle.
</P>
<P>
"He's like a hero to everyone back home," his aunt said from the apartment
building where Freeman was raised. "We're all glued to our TV sets waiting to
see if they put him in jail."
</P>
<P>
Freeman's First Amendment stance has drawn him into the national
anti-censorship debate. He has appeared on "Donahue," "Crossfire," "Geraldo"
and "Good Morning America." His attorney, Bruce Rogow, suggested that Freeman's
act of civil disobedience is historic.
</P>
<P>
"He is a modern First Amendment martyr," Rogow said. "If only there were 1,000
Charles Freemans. The fact is, if all the retailers in America had the courage
to stand up to the censors like Charles did, none of this would be happening at
all."
</P>
<P>
Some of the most powerful forces in the music industry have pledged to support
Freeman in his legal battle. On Friday, Freeman is scheduled to meet in
Washington with Recording Industry Assn. of America Executive Vice President
Hilary Rosen. Freeman said he is grateful that the record industry has finally
signed on to support him in his struggle.
</P>
<P>
"The crusaders are after mom-and-pop shops like mine right now, but you big
retail chains and record companies better watch your backs," Freeman said. "If
I go to jail, you better believe they'll be coming after you next."

POP EYE: KEEPING A SCORECARD ON WINNERS, LOSERS IN RECORD INDUSTRY WARS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN and PAUL GREIN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the Year of the Comeback, with everyone from the Rolling Stones to
Donny Osmond to Alice Cooper making big splashes.
</P>
<P>
 But behind the scenes, the record industry was full of tumult, with a flurry
of executive shuffles and company sell-offs (the biggest being A&amp;M, which
PolyGram bought for an eye-popping $500 million).
</P>
<P>
 Still, most labels remained comfortably in the black, thanks largely to the
continuing compact disc boom. Times are so good that everybody wants to get
into the music business. Topping the list: Irving Azoff, who's starting his own
label, and the Walt Disney Co., which is jumping in with Hollywood Records.
</P>
<P>
 Is there room for more players in the already fiercely competitive industry?
Will the new labels spark a fierce bidding war as they vie for budding
superstars? Will the CD boom finally go bust?
</P>
<P>
 While the music business ponders these and other questions over the holidays,
Pop Eye takes a look at how the industry's major players fared this year.
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M Records
</P>
<P>
PolyGram Inc. certainly didn't buy A&amp;M based on its 1989 performance,
though the label's lackluster showing over the past year may have been what
finally prompted Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss to sell the company they had
founded in 1962. (The execs shrewdly kept A&amp;M's prized music-publishing
firm.) It was such a bad year that the label's biggest hit until October was a
fluke No. 1 single by soap-opera star Michael Damian. Happily, Janet Jackson
came through late in the year with "Rhythm Nation," her ballyhooed follow-up
album to "Control," which sold a quick two million copies.
</P>
<P>
Arista
</P>
<P>
Critics rarely rave about Arista artists, but the label has achieved a solid
track record in recent years by discovering acts with Top 40 appeal, such as
Whitney Houston, Expose and Taylor Dayne. This year's new model is Milli
Vanilli, a pair of poster-boy popsters whose debut album has sold five million
copies (and counting) -- and spun off a trio of No. 1 singles. But despite the
company's high pop profile, the Eurythmics' label debut album has gotten off to
a slow start, and Dion's comeback attempt fizzled.
</P>
<P>
Atlantic
</P>
<P>
It was a platinum pajama party as the label's leading ladies all hit the Top
10. Bette Midler landed one of the biggest surprise hits of the year with the
"Beaches" sound track, which spawned her first No. 1 single, "Wind Beneath My
Wings." An even bigger surprise was the Top 10 success of Donna Summer's first
post-Geffen single. Debbie Gibson aged gracefully, landing her first No. 1
album and another No. 1 single. Skid Row (who are even prettier than Gibson)
and Winger (who aren't) also scored platinum albums. Phil Collins and his
Genesis mate Mike Rutherford (with the Mechanics) each topped the singles
chart, but Foreigner's Mick Jones bombed with his debut solo album.
</P>
<P>
Capitol
</P>
<P>
After several sluggish years for the label, Capitol's executives were in the
hot seat -- and president David Berman got burned. The industry vet got the ax
in September and was replaced by Hale Milgrim, a touted marketing exec from
Elektra Records. The label's A&amp;R department, which had a poor track record
of discovering new hitmakers, was also reorganized this fall. Many of the
label's 1989 hits were with acts on the comeback trail, notably Bonnie Raitt
(who had her highest-charting album ever), the Doobie Brothers and even Donny
Osmond, who shocked the industry by zooming to No. 2 on the singles chart with
"Soldier of Love." But the label's most cherished comeback bid was its biggest
disappointment: Paul McCartney's "Flowers in the Dirt" album, which didn't even
crack the Top 20. The label nabbed the Beastie Boys, but the rap hotshots'
follow-up to their No. 1 CBS debut stalled at No. 14. Capitol had a platinum
album from rapper M.C. Hammer, and, thanks to its deal with Enigma, hard-rock
hits by Great White and Poison.
</P>
<P>
Columbia
</P>
<P>
The industry is crediting new kids on the block with lifting this sleeping
giant out of a lengthy slump. And they're not just talking about teen phenoms
New Kids on the Block, whose "Hangin' Tough" album has sold 6 million copies --
the year's best seller. They're also referring to the arrival of a new
management team headed by former rock manager Tommy Mottola and one-time Arista
hotshot Don Ienner. The label's renowned marketing machinery also sparked
comebacks by Billy Joel and the Rolling Stones. A greatest hits set by Journey
quietly sold 2 million copies; making more noise on their way to platinum were
metal upstarts Warrant and a trio of rap acts from Columbia's Def Jam
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Elektra
</P>
<P>
It's time for label chief Bob Krasnow to light up another victory cigar. The
most artist-oriented label of the '80s continued to prosper with a remarkably
diverse talent roster. Where else could you find speed-metal masters Metallica
rubbing shoulders with silky show-tune crooner Michael Feinstein? Elektra's
across-the-board 1989 successes ranged from metal homeboys Motley Crue (who
landed their first No. 1 album) to post-punk heroes the Cure, who had their
biggest album to date (and headlined Dodger Stadium).
</P>
<P>
EMI
</P>
<P>
This label has had more to brag about in recent years than its much larger
sister label, Capitol. Richard Marx avoided the sophomore jinx with "Repeat
Offender," which has already outsold his first album, topping the 3 million
mark. Marx also came through with a pair of No. 1 singles as did Roxette,
Sweden's hottest pop export since ABBA. David Bowie's "Tin Machine" was the
label's biggest disappointment, barely making the Top 30.
</P>
<P>
Epic
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a concerted label push and pivotal MTV support, Living Colour made
history as the first black rock band to go platinum since the heyday of Jimi
Hendrix and Sly &amp; the Family Stone. But with the exception of that album
and Gloria Estefan's strong showing, Epic was living on its past laurels this
year. Its other platinum albums (Ozzy Osbourne, Europe and Joan Jett) were all
holdovers from 1988. Company stalwarts Cyndi Lauper and the Jacksons bombed, as
did label newcomers Liza Minnelli and the Jefferson Airplane. One comeback that
did pan out was Alice Cooper, who mined his first gold album since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Geffen
</P>
<P>
Talk about a label with momentum to burn. After a few lean years in the mid
'80s, Geffen has built a much-envied track record in recent years thanks to a
shrewd promotion department and a stable of high-profile (and hotly
competitive) A&amp;R execs. The label has had so much success that it's
expected to reactivate Asylum Records early next year to make room for more
young artists. Two smash albums by hometown bad boys Guns N' Roses sold a
combined total of 5 million copies. Aerosmith and Don Henley returned with
platinum albums, while Cher (aided by a revealing video shot on the U.S.S.
Missouri) earned the first platinum album of her career. Edie Brickell &amp;
the New Bohemians rode their 1988 album into the Top 5 in February.
</P>
<P>
MCA
</P>
<P>
Is there life after Irving Azoff? Last summer the industry's most colorful (and
controversial) figure left the label he brought back from the dead to start a
new company bankrolled by Warner Bros. The crowning achievement for Azoff and
his team -- which included successor Al Teller -- came in July when MCA became
the first label in eight years to monopolize the top three spots on Billboard's
pop album chart. The label scored with the Fine Young Cannibals (whose album
had the longest run at No. 1 this year), Bobby Brown and Tom Petty. The label's
black music division also had hits with Heavy D. &amp; the Boyz and Guy
featuring Teddy Riley. On the other hand, Tiffany's album fell short of the
phenomenal success of her 1987 debut, and Patti LaBelle's latest flopped.
</P>
<P>
Motown
</P>
<P>
In its first full year of operation since former MCA hotshot Jheryl Busby took
over the top job, Motown has been trying to regain some of its long-lost
momentum by going after fresh talent and building relationships with hot
producers. But it still has a long way to go. The one-time hit factory had a
platinum album with teen dreams the Boys, but had the year's most embarrassing
bomb with Diana Ross' "Workin' Overtime," the pop diva's heralded return to her
former home.
</P>
<P>
PolyGram
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, PolyGram was one of the industry's hottest rock
factories, fueled by such bands as Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. This year it
cooled off considerably, perhaps prompting the sudden departure of label chief
Dick Asher last month. The label's biggest album was a multiplatinum holdover
from 1988, Bon Jovi's "New Jersey." John Cougar Mellencamp and Tears for Fears
released eagerly awaited new albums that went platinum, but didn't match past
sales triumphs. Critics raved, however, about a pair of down-home up 'n'
comers, Michelle Shocked and Texas.
</P>
<P>
RCA
</P>
<P>
It was a quiet year for ol' Nipper, which didn't have much product from its pop
mainstays and lost respected A&amp;R chief Paul Atkinson to MCA. Apart from a
strong showing by its venerable country division, the label has been living off
profits from its "Dirty Dancing" sound-track bonanzas. In country, K. T. Oslin
and the Judds each had two platinum albums while newcomer Clint Black scored a
gold album. The best news for the rock division came from heavy-metal goddess
Lita Ford, whose 1988 "Lita" album went platinum, and gothic-popsters Love and
Rockets, whose album went Top 15.
</P>
<P>
Virgin
</P>
<P>
Wanna bet on who'll be the hottest industry label of the early '90s? We'll put
our money on Virgin, a daring young label run by creative executives with a
shrewd eye for artists with strong visual identity. Two years ago Paula Abdul
was choreographing Janet Jackson's videos. Now she's Jackson's arch-rival as
the princess of dance pop, thanks to a trio of spiffy videos that ruled MTV all
year. All three of those singles reached No. 1, as did Abdul's debut album,
which has sold more than 4 million copies. Virgin also had platinum albums from
the late Roy Orbison and hot newcomers Soul II Soul, plus critical valentines
for hip-hop diva Neneh Cherry and singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz.
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes of the music business, Warners is renowned for its executive
stability, wide-ranging artist roster and comfortable, family-style
environment. This year, the Burbank-based company continued to be the
industry's most watched -- and most imitated -- firm (even if some young Turks
are grumbling that the label is resting on its laurels a bit). Madonna and
Prince, the '80s' most erotic and adventuresome pop icons, were back at No. 1
with double-platinum albums. The label's folksy oldsters the Traveling Wilburys
also sold 2 million, while Karyn White became the year's hottest black female
singer with her debut album. Warners, with its Reprise and Sire affiliates,
also had impressive outings with the B-52's, Lou Reed, the Cult, Elvis Costello
and Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
Mighty Indies
</P>
<P>
Delicious Vinyl landed the first No. 1 album by a black rapper with Tone Loc's
"Loc-ed After Dark" in April, and has Young M.C. coming on strong. . . .
Priority landed two platinum albums with gangster-style rappers Eazy-E and
N.W.A, whose incendiary anthems on "Straight Outta Compton" were the most hotly
debated pop lyrics of the year. . . . Profile's rap crew, Rob Base &amp; D.J.
E-Z Rock, also went platinum. . . . Def Jam had platinum hits with Slick Rick,
LL Cool J and Public Enemy. . . . Tommy Boy won critical plaudits and gold
sales with its rap rookies, De La Soul. . . . After losing both Robert Palmer
and Steve Winwood, Island was sold to PolyGram. . . . And Rhino had continued
success with its rock oldie reissues.

<LEADPARA>  GET out the riot gear again. Guns N' Roses is about to cause another stir.
This time it won't be at your nearby stadium, however, but at your local
record store. On Tuesday, the group's two new albums, "Use Your Illusion I and
II," make their debut.;   The albums' release comes after months of delays,
four years after GN'R's debut studio record, "Appetite for Destruction" (which
has sold 14 million copies) and three years after the 6 million-selling EP "G
N' R Lies."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The hoopla and "numbers" surrounding the new records are equally stunning.
The group's label, Geffen, reports that approximately 1,000 record stores
around the country plan to open at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday -- to accommodate the
fans who just can't wait any longer -- and that various radio stations will be
broadcasting from those stores.;   Responding to the anticipated demand, the
company is also shipping 2 million copies of each of the albums in the United
States.;   And Saturday, Album Network, a music trade publication, is
sponsoring a satellite broadcast of a three-hour "listening party" focused on
the albums. The broadcast comes with interviews with GN'R that were recorded
at the Mustang Ranch near Reno.;   Now, about the albums: Each comes with 75
minutes of music, weighing in at a combined 30 songs and 2 1/2 hours of
gut-busting GN'R sound. Several of those songs were part of the group's
controversial U.S. tour this summer. "You Could Be Mine" (from "II") was part
of the soundtrack of the film "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (released as the
album's first single, it sold 1 1/2 million copies in 30 days). And the ballad
"Don't Cry" (from "I") was released Sept. 3 as an advance for the albums.;
Could this be the event of the season? Possibly. It is the first time that a
group of this stature has released two albums of new material simultaneously.
And with the various delays, the fans' appetite for GN'R has reached a
screeching pitch. Now all the group has to do is live up to the moment with
its music. Will they do it? Tune in next week when we review the records.;
TOUR NEWS -- The halcyon days of techno-pop are now long gone, but one of the
finer groups from those days, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, is set to
begin its U.S. tour Sunday. They come to the D.N.A in San Francisco on Oct.
8.;   At the opposite end of pop from the synthesizer sound of techno-pop is
sweet soul music, and none is sweeter than that of soul-romantic Luther
Vandross. Vandross comes to the Bay Area for a show at the Oakland Coliseum
Arena, Oct. 24. Tickets go on sale Saturday (show times and ticket prices were
not available at press time).;   JAZZ AT FILOLI -- The final performance of
the Jazz at Filoli series is set for Saturday, and it's a winner. Legendary
vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson will present his music, which spans several
generations of jazz from bop to the modal school. The performance -- which
also comes with a question-and-answer section with the illustrious jazzman --
begins at 1:30 p.m. at the Filoli Mansion, Canada Road, Woodside. Tickets are
$25, and the number to call is (415) 364-8300.;   JAZZ AGAIN -- The dates for
the next edition of the San Jose Jazz Festival have now been set: Aug. 7-9,
1992. The 1991 version, this past August, drew 35,000 fans to Plaza Park, the
largest crowd ever to come to an event at that location. Updates and
information about the 1992 festival are available from the San Jose Jazz
Society, at (408) 288-7557.;   ON WITH THE SHOWS -- On sale Sunday: tickets to
the Oct. 12 Day on the Green at the Oakland Coliseum Stadium. The event stars
Metallica, Faith No More, Soundgarden and Queensryche. Tickets are $28.50. And
Saturday, tickets go on sale for Procol Harum's show at the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco, Oct. 3 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $18.50. These are the guys
who gave the world one of pop's greatest masterpieces, "A Whiter Shade of
Pale," back in 1967. Call (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277 for both shows.  </TEXT>

POP EYE: 'MISS SAIGON' SINGS PRIOR TO BROADWAY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unless you're willing to fly to London, you can't possibly see "Miss Saigon,"
theater impresario Cameron Mackintosh's latest musical extravaganza. But you
can buy the original London cast recording this week -- even though the musical
won't open on Broadway until sometime in the spring of 1991.
</P>
<P>
What's the rush?
</P>
<P>
"Through the success other labels had with 'Les Miserables' and 'Phantom of the
Opera,' we've realized there's an incredible market for cast recordings, long
before the show actually arrives here," said Geffen Records president Ed
Rosenblatt, whose label is releasing the double-album (and two CD) cast
recording. "These kinds of shows are worldwide media events."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rosenblatt predicts that the London cast recording, whose CDs sell for
a whopping $31.98 (the double-album on vinyl goes for $19.98) will break the
platinum barrier of 1 million copies sold before the show arrives in the
States.
</P>
<P>
If so, the sales success will be a testimony to the new global reach of such
high-tech entertainment packages as "Miss Saigon," which like its "Les Miz"
predecessor, is more of an event than a traditional stage musical. (Reviewing
the show, which is set in crumbling 1975 Saigon, Newsweek dubbed it " 'Madame
Butterfly' with choppers.")
</P>
<P>
It would be the lastest in a series of recorded stage shows that reached
America before the show itself. "Jesus Christ Superstar," "Evita" and "Chess"
were earlier examples of the trend.
</P>
<P>
It's somehow fitting that Geffen, which owns a "significant" chunk of the the
"Miss Saigon" production, is releasing the London cast recording at a time when
the record business is abuzz with reports that industry giant EMI is
negotiating to either buy Geffen or distribute its musical releases worldwide.
In an era when entertainment conglomerates eagerly gobble up new product,
Geffen's release of the "Saigon" score is a perfect example of corporate
synergy.
</P>
<P>
" 'Miss Saigon' is the ultimate in synergy," Rosenblatt said. "The cast album
helps advertise the show. And then when people see the show, they want to buy
the album. So it works on both ends."
</P>
<P>
So far, this marketing scheme has paid off in record sales for Geffen. It's
distribution of "Cats" has topped the 2 million mark, while "Les Miz" is at
950,000 and "Dreamgirls" has sold a solid 500,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
PolyGram Records, which distributes original cast recordings of both Andrew
Lloyd-Webber's "Phantom of the Opera" and "Aspects of Love," has enjoyed equal
success. The double-CD set of "Phantom," which was released five months before
the show hit Broadway, has now sold nearly 1.5 million copies, an impressive
figure, especially considering that PolyGram also released a single-CD
"highlights" package that sold an additional 600,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
Polygram marketing chief Jim Urie credits the label's aggressive marketing
strategy with stimulating sales. After the show hit Broadway, PolyGram
organized contests at many adult-contemporary radio stations, sponsoring ticket
giveaways and free trips to New York to see the show.
</P>
<P>
"People's motivations for buying scores and sound tracks are completely
different," said Urie, PolyGram's senior vice president of marketing. "People
buy movie sound tracks because of a hit song. But they buy original cast
recordings because of the show's story line or because of the event-atmosphere
surrounding it."
</P>
<P>
Still, original scores are expensive to market and produce. Rosenblatt says
Geffen has earmarked an initial ad budget of $500,000 for the cast album, which
cost another $250,000 -- or more -- to produce. Thankfully, the media provides
a generous boost of free advertising. Even though "Miss Saigon" isn't due here
for another year, the splashy show has already received write-ups in Time,
Life, People and Newsweek and many key newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of Americans have already been over to London, as tourists, to
see the show," said Rosenblatt. "And then there's always a ton of people who
just want to own an original cast recording. It's like having a first-edition
of a popular new book. They'll probably want to buy the American cast recording
too."
</P>
<P>
And talk about synergy. Guess who'll be putting out the American cast
recording, within two months of "Miss Saigon's" opening day on Broadway? Geffen
Records, of course.

RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A

*** AC/DC "The Razor's Edge" Atco
</P>
<P>
This Australian band has been accused of making the same album over and over
since it began in the mid-'70s, thumping assemblages of pentatonic power chords
and leering innuendo -- a style so distinctive that you can always recognize an
AC/DC tune on the radio.
</P>
<P>
It's rock 'n' roll stripped to its absolute basics of noise, beat and schoolboy
aggression -- any high school dude with a guitar can reproduce any AC/DC riff.
</P>
<P>
The group's last few albums have sold well, but nowhere near the
umpteen-million copies they routinely sold between 1979 and 1982. AC/DC's
rotation on hard-rock stations is probably nearly as high as Led Zep's, but
what's played is mostly 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
This time out, the band hired hot Aerosmith/Bon Jovi producer Bruce Fairburn,
and the album still rocks like AC/DC, but a rather slick version thereof.
</P>
<P>
AC/DC's trademark gritty guitars are softened up; studio swooshing fills the
famous empty space between power chords; vocalist Brian Johnson actually tries
to sing instead of yelp like a wolverine. The tinge of mainstream rock may make
longtime fans scream, but "Razor's Edge" is probably AC/DC's best album since
1985's "Fly on the Wall." JONATHAN GOLD

<LEADPARA>  SONY Music has signed the rock group Aerosmith to one of the largest contracts
in the record business: about $30 million for four records, people involved in
the negotiations report.;    The deal comes shortly after Sony signed Michael
Jackson to a five-record, $25 million contract. The other major contracts in
the industry have been Janet Jackson's $32 million contract for three records
with Island Records and the Rolling Stones' $25 million contract with CBS
Records, signed in 1984.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SONY SIGNS AEROSMITH TO $30 MILLION RECORD
DEAL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sony declined to comment on the terms of the deal, but a person close to
Aerosmith said the group would get about $10 million on signing and that there
was no timetable for delivery of the records.;    Aerosmith had been under
contract to Geffen Records, which is now owned by Matsushita Electrical Co.
and run by David Geffen.;    Geffen said Wednesday that he had the rights to
the group's next two studio albums and a greatest-hits album. "Traditionally
they make a record once every three or four years," he said. "At that rate
they will probably make their first record for Sony in 1995.";    Two
top-level record industry executives said they thought the deal was very risky
for Sony because the group members, including lead singer Steven Tyler and
lead guitarist Joe Perry, will be well into their 40s when they would start to
record for Sony.;    Aerosmith enjoyed tremendous popularity during the 1970s
with such Columbia Records albums as "Get Your Wings," "Toys in the Attic" and
"Rocks." Aerosmith has sold more than 30 million records at Columbia.;    But
the band's popularity waned after the departure of guitarist Joe Perry in
1979. Aerosmith persevered without the guitarist, but their post-Perry
recordings sold modestly. Perry reconciled with the band in the mid-'80s, and
the guitarist and Tyler underwent a well-documented drug-detox period.;
Aerosmith signed with Geffen Records in the mid-'80s and scored a remarkable
comeback with their "Permanent Vacation" album. The record sold 3 million
copies and featured radio-MTV hits like "Angel" and "Dude (Looks Like a
Lady)." A headline tour featuring Guns N' Roses was one of the
highest-grossing jaunts of the 1980s.;    The band's 1989 "Pump" album has
sold more than 6 million copies and yielded two top-five singles.  </TEXT>

   Despite a sales slump in the record business, Virgin Music
Group signed a pricey new contract with the Rolling Stones,
and Time Warner Inc. is close to signing a deal that will
give Madonna millions more for every new record.
   With the expiration of the Stones' current recording
contract with Sony Corp., Virgin, based in London and part of
closely held Virgin Group of Cos., said it signed a
three-record deal with the group beginning in 1993. Terms
weren't disclosed, but industry executives valued the
agreement at more than $35 million. In addition to three new
records, Virgin Music will get the back catalog of Stones
albums from 1971 onward.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Stones deal had been rumored for weeks in the
industry. Sony's Sony Music unit had been negotiating with
the Stones for a new contract, but people familiar with the
talks said the company balked at paying the Stones' asking
price, concerned about the group's age -- the members are in
the 40s and 50s -- and future appeal to younger audiences. A
top Sony official declined to discuss the negotiations, other
than to say "we made an offer we thought was economic."
   Sony is believed to have paid the Stones $6 million in
advance for each of several albums in the 1980s; the new
Virgin agreement is said to raise those advances to $8
million. Sony Music, then CBS Records, made news by stealing
the Stones away from Atlantic Records in the early 1980s with
a deal that stunned the industry at the time. Some industry
executives speculate Sony lost money on some albums, but Sony
says the overall deal was profitable. Industry sources said
that while the Stones' most recent album, "Steel Wheels,"
sold about two million copies in the U.S. alone, the album
before that, "Undercover" is said to have sold less than one
million copies world-wide.
   In any case, Sony has put millions into two other
expensive gambles recently: its multi-media deal with Michael
Jackson reportedly worth more than $60 million to the pop
star, and a deal valued at more than $35 million with another
aging rock band, Aerosmith.
   But a number of other record companies apparently were
interested in the Stones, and bidders were said to include
PolyGram, 80% owned by Philips Electronics N.V. of the
Netherlands. Virgin, the largest independent label in the
record business, appears to be motivated by the lack of a
major rock act on a roster that includes pop singers Paula
Abdul and Janet Jackson.
   The Madonna deal with the Sire Records label, within
Warner Music Group, is a different matter; Madonna still owes
her label three records but was seeking a richer deal.
Negotiations have been dragging on for months, but a source
close to the company said that the Madonna contract may be
signed by year end. A new contract could include a jump in
advances to about $5 million per record from $3 million. In
addition, her royalty rate will rise to 20% from 18%,
industry sources said.
   The new 20% royalty rate for Madonna puts her below the
25% some superstars get, but her albums don't sell near as
many as Michael Jackson's, for example. Her last album, a
live concert recording, sold between seven and eight million
copies world-wide, while the last Jackson album sold 25
million world-wide. Sources close to the deal said that
Madonna's lawyers talked tough, but she had less bargaining
power since she still owed three records to her label. Two
more were added under the deal at the new fees.
   In addition, Madonna will be getting an undisclosed sum to
set up her own record label to record other acts, tentatively
to be called Home. Sources said Time Warner hasn't signed off
on the deal yet partly because it is still fine-tuning
clauses involving film deals and possible book deals. On the
movie side, Madonna is a riskier proposition; though she had
a role in the successful "Dick Tracy," most of her efforts --
such as "Who's That Girl" and "Shanghai Surprise" -- have
flopped.
   Still, of the two mega-deals, the Virgin/Stones deal has
raised more eyebrows in the music industry. The Madonna terms
are hefty but not unreasonable for a world-wide rock star who
is young and continues to re-invent herself. Virgin's future
is also in some question, as rumors persist that the company
is for sale.
   But yesterday, Richard Branson, the principal owner of the
Virgin companies, which include Virgin Atlantic airline,
released a statement denying persistent rumors that Virgin is
in talks to sell its music company to Thorn EMI PLC.

'NASTY': SAN ANTONIO POLICE WARN RECORD STORES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in San Antonio, Tex., have started warning record store retailers that
they could face obscenity charges for selling the controversial album "As Nasty
as They Wanna Be" by the rap group 2 Live Crew. As a result of the warning,
several independent record store owners and at least one major chain have
removed the album from their shelves.
</P>
<P>
The move follows last week's ruling in Florida by U.S. Dist. Judge Jose
Gonzalez who found the album obscene under that state's law and his
interpretation of a 1973 Supreme Court decision. On Sunday, two 2 Live Crew
members were arrested on obscenity charges after performing the banned lyrics
at an adults-only nightclub concert. Two days earlier, a record store owner in
Hollywood, Fla., was arrested on an obscenity charge for selling the album.
</P>
<P>
However, Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander of the San Antonio vice squad, said
Wednesday that police there were not cracking down on retailers or threatening
them with arrest. "We're merely going by the locations and providing them with
a transcript of the lyrics of the album," Pittman said. "We did not tell them
to remove the album from the shelves. That would be a violation of First
Amendment rights and prior restraint."
</P>
<P>
Under current Texas obscenity statutes, retailers must be aware of the contents
of the material they are selling before they can be charged with a violation.
</P>
<P>
"If the complaints from parents keep coming in, then police will begin
conducting undercover investigations and undercover buys," Pittman said. "We
will take the tape to a judge, and if a judge determines that the material is
obscene, then the clerk will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to approach this as reasonably as possible," he added. "We would
rather do this than subject cashiers, many of whom are teens or high school
kids, to arrest."
</P>
<P>
But some retailers took the police action as a direct threat to get the albums
off their shelves or face prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Hastings Records and Tapes, a chain of 120 stores in Texas and 14 surrounding
states, removed the album from its stores. "We're not going to put our managers
or associates in jeopardy," said Walter McNeer, vice president of Hastings.
"We're going to follow the law, whatever the law is."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was unhappy with the decision. "I'm concerned, because
adults should have a choice," he said. "We've restricted sale of the album to
anyone under 18."
</P>
<P>
"I think (the possibility of prosecution) basically stinks," said Dave Risher,
owner of Hogwild Records, which is located across the street from San Antonio
College. Risher said he was visited by vice officers Tuesday who asked him to
voluntarily remove the album. "I don't think the vice squad is operating within
their rights."
</P>
<P>
As far as selling the album, Risher said the issue was moot: "I'm out of stock.
I sold my one copy to a TV station. But I'm leaning toward selling it if I get
more copies."
</P>
<P>
Joe Regur, owner of J.R.'s Record Exchange, also was defiant. "I don't feel
that individuals complaining to the police can tell me or any owner of a record
store what they can or cannot sell, especially when it comes to adults. I can't
listen and be responsible for every track on every album in my store."
</P>
<P>
But Pittman said most store owners were willingly removing the album. "When
they read the transcripts, they were appalled over the language," he said. "The
response was positive. They said it was nothing but garbage."
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for conviction of selling obscene material in Texas can be
up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.

   A rap group kept its promise to
sing lyrics from an album ruled obscene and authorities kept their
word, arresting two members of 2 Live Crew on Sunday after an
adults-only concert.
   The early-morning arrests came four days after a federal judge
declared obscene the Miami group's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be,'' and two days after a local record dealer was arrested for
selling the popular recording.
   Broward County sheriff's deputies arrested 2 Live Crew leader
Luther Campbell, 29, and singer Chris Wongwon, 26, shortly after
the show at a Hollywood nightclub.
   ``We didn't want to create any commotion in there, so I told
them to let them get out of there and arrest them away from the
premises,'' said Sheriff Nick Navarro, who has led a campaign to
ban sales of the group's records.
   Deputies pulled over the rappers' limousine a couple of blocks
away from the club, said sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon.
   Only Campbell and Wongwon were taken because the group split up
after the performance, heading in different directions in three
vehicles, Gordon said.
   ``We didn't have enough deputies to cover them,'' he explained,
adding that arrest warrants for members Mark Ross and David Hobbs
would be issued Monday.
   Campbell and Wongwon were booked at the Broward County Jail on
the misdemeanor charge of violating a prohibition against obscene
performances. The charges were based on the group's performance of
material from the album, which has sold more than 1.7 million
copies.
   They were freed without bond. No court appearance was set. If
convicted, they could face up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Bruce Rogow, 2 Live Crew's lawyer, said the arrests amounted to
police harassment. The rappers themselves had left for a concert in
Phoenix and could not immediately be reached for comment.
   ``To have a dozen sheriff's officers spending all this time over
some dirty lyrics seems to me to be obscene,'' Rogow said.
   Plainclothes deputies were inside the club early Sunday as the
rap group led the crowd in chanting repeated insults aimed at
Navarro, but Gordon said the arrests were not meant as retaliation.
   ``They announced on TV newscasts they were going to do the songs
which the judge has ruled obscene,'' Gordon said. ``That's pretty
much the same reason we arrested the shopkeeper.''
   E-C Records owner Charles Freeman sold a record and a tape
version of the album to an undercover deputy Friday in front of
news photographers. He faces a first-degree misdemeanor charge and
is free on $100 bond.
   Gordon said the arrests were in keeping with Navarro's
``contention that if you break the law in Broward County, you're
going to jail.''
   Deputies had been checking area record stores since the
Wednesday ruling by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez, Gordon said.
The only copies of the double album they located were those
confiscated in Friday's arrest, he said.
   About 15 police officers and 300 fans were on hand Saturday
night as the rappers performed an early show for patrons of all
ages at Hollywood's Club Futura. At that show the group performed
what it calls the ``clean'' version of the album's songs, omitting
the controversial lyrics. Many of the young concert-goers shouted
the ``nasty'' lyrics themselves.
   About 400 people showed up for the later, adults-only ``nasty''
set early Sunday.
   In nearby Miami Beach on Friday night, 2 Live Crew performed the
``nasty'' lyrics at another adults-only nightclub show. That
performance went off without incident or arrest, despite the fact
that the club was in Dade County and therefore covered by the
judge's ruling. The ruling declared the recording obscene in
Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties.

   Michael Jackson, the androgynous whirling
dervish of pop music, is packing away his traveling clothes and
parking the tour bus.
   The reclusive creator of the moonwalk has said through surrogates
that his 16-month international ``Bad'' tour, set to wind up Friday
night with a sold-out show at the Sports Arena, will be his last.
   The 30-year-old Jackson, celebrated as widely for his
eccentricities as for his stunningly original songs, vocals and
choreography, intends to keep recording and is considering film
roles.
   ``I'm not saying he's not going to perform live again, but I
don't think we'll ever go out on tour like this,'' said Jackson's
manager, Frank Dileo.
   Jackson, who hasn't granted an interview since 1984, is said to
be interested in movies because of the transience of live
performance.
   ``He wants a medium that is more permanent,'' said concert
spokeswoman Maureen O'Connor. ``You do a show and after you do it,
it's over.''
   Friday night's concert comes exactly five years after the
singer's hair caught fire while he made a Pepsi commercial at the
nearby Shrine Auditorium. The accident, caused by an errant smoke
bomb, caused scalp burns.
   The concert was the last of four scheduled this month in Los
Angeles to make up for December dates Jackson canceled because of
strained vocal cords, apparently brought on by the rigors of the
tour.
   Catapulted into the public eye at age 5 with the Jackson Five
family pop group, Jackson has left his brothers behind to become a
one-man phenomenon.
   Fans and the tabloid press breathlessly follow the
eccentricities: his repeated cosmetic surgery, his menagerie of
exotic pets, his failed attempt to buy the bones of ``Elephant Man''
John Merrick.
   He won an unprecedented eight Grammy Awards for his ``Thriller''
album, which has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, the
most successful LP of all time.
   His ``Bad'' album has sold more than 19 million copies since its
1987 release. It is the first album to spawn five No. 1 hits.
   The ``Bad'' tour, which opened in Japan in September 1987, has
been seen by 4.4 million people in at least 15 countries and set a
box office record with more than $125 million in gross ticket sales.
   Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana attended one of his
shows at London's 72,000-seat Wembley Stadium. Jackson's June 18
performance at the Berlin Wall drew 65,000 West Germans, and police
wielding cattle prods were called to drive away 4,000 East Germans
who risked arrest to hear Jackson.

   The American Civil Liberties Union filed
suit Monday challenging a sales ban on ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be,'' the album by rap group 2 Live Crew.
   The suit filed in Richland County Circuit Court asks for a
prohibition on arrests for the sale of the album. It also asks that
a judge decide whether the album is obscene.
   Richland prosecutor Jim Anders, who in June threatened to
prosecute those selling the album, is named as the defendant. Three
record stores have joined the ACLU as plaintiffs, said Steve Bates,
executive director for the South Carolina ACLU.
   Anders welcomes the suit's request for a determination on
whether the material is obscene, he said, adding, ``I think it
ought to apply statewide.''
   Joe Watson, prosecutor for Greenville and Pickens counties, has
also threatened prosecution of stores who sell ``Nasty.''
   Bates said the record ``has significant literary, artistic and
political values that reflect the African and Afro-American
heritage of a large segment of our population.''
   He acknowledged that 2 Live Crew's use of raw and sometimes
violent sexual imagery in songs like ``Me So Horny'' made it
``tough to argue this.''
   By South Carolina standards, Anders said, the album is obscene.
The ACLU is a group that wants ``anything to go,'' he said.
   A person found selling obscene material under state law could be
subject to a maximum fine of $5,000 and five years imprisonment.
   The group has been at the center of a First Amendment-obscenity
battle since June, when group members were arrested in Hollywood,
Fla., after they performed songs from the album in a nightclub.
   A federal judge in Florida declared the album obscene.
   Selling ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' has also been banned in
the city of Aiken, and the city of Charleston in July kept a
city-owned outlet from selling tickets to a 2 Live Crew performance
at a private auditorium.
   The controversy is helping 2 Live Crew's sales nationwide.
   The group's ``Banned in the U.S.A.'' album, a free-speech anthem
based on the Bruce Springsteen song, ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' has
sold nearly a million copies.

<LEADPARA>  IT'S been less than two years since Clint Black turned the country-music
industry on its ear, and already the 29-year-old singer/songwriter has more
than enough awards, ribbons, medals and gold records to fill an entire room.
But if there's one piece of booty the Texas phenom is proudest of, it's
probably the one that sits out in the garage.;    Back in 1989, when Black was
just another new kid in Nashville with a ready smile and a bagful of songs,
producer James Stroud told him, jokingly, "If you get me a gold record, you
can have my Porsche." Black's debutalbum, "Killin' Time," took off like a shot
from a howitzer -- going gold (500,000 copies) in five months, platinum (a
million copies) in nine months and double platinum (2 million copies) in 18
months. The new kid with the nice smile got his Porsche.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I love that car," said Black, in a phone call from Nashville last week.
"Before we start the next album, I'm going up to take a look at his house.";
 Black, whose tour with Merle Haggard and Carlene Carter rolls through the Cow
Palace in Daly City tonight, is currently the hottest name in country music.
With James Dean looks, a crisp, pared-down musical style and gentle,
self-effacing humor, Black is the embodiment of the new traditionalist
movement that's pumping new life into the once-moribund country scene.;
Black's conquest of the country-music industry has been so complete and so
lightning-fast it makes Operation Desert Storm seem like the Peloponnesian War
by comparison. Black's stats are beyond any record executive's wildest dream:
"Killin' Time" occupied the No. 1 slot on the Billboard country-album chart
for 31 weeks and produced five No. 1 singles. The first single, "A Better
Man," was the first debut single to top the country chart in 15 years. The
album even moved onto Billboard's Top-40 pop-album chart.;    In November,
while "Killin' Time" was still in the No. 1 slot, RCA Records released Black's
latest album, "Put Yourself in My Shoes." It sold a million copies in a month.
Today, "Put Yourself in My Shoes" is at No 2 on the country-album chart, and
"Killin' Time" is still at No. 9, almost two years after its release.;
Lately it seems as if Black has spent more time at award shows than at
concerts: In '89 the country industry's Blackest season began with the Country
Music Association's Horizon Award -- given to the most promising newcomer.
Last October, he bagged the association's best-male-vocalist and
best-new-touring-artist prizes. Last April, he swept through four top
categories at the Academy of Country Music's annual awards: best album, best
single, best new male vocalist and best male vocalist.;    The blizzard of
accolades continues, and Black stays the course. "I don't feel pressure from
the awards and the polls and the charts. Those things are just a hand up the
ladder. The real pressure I feel is whenever I'm in the studio and close to
finishing a record," he said. "Making critical decisions then is always tough.
I would have liked to have a lot more time with the last album, but I'm
realistic about it. In order to spend more time in the studio, I would have
had to pass up some of the other things I've done.";    Black's lyric
stock-in-trade is songs about good women who leave too soon and bad jobs that
don't end soon enough. "People always saw me as a good-hearted guy looking at
the bright side of things. A guy smiling through the pain. And it put me in a
really good light," said Black, straining to find an explanation for his
meteoric rise.;    Not long ago, few people would have ever wanted to put
themselves in Black's shoes: "There was never a time I doubted I was meant to
be in this business," said Black, who began working the Houston honky-tonk
circuit straight out of high school. "But there was a time when I realized I
should get some other work in order to rest my voice. There was no way I could
go into a studio and record anything decent after working six straight nights
in a bar. Three long sets -- hundreds of songs -- night in and night out,
really chewed me up." His day jobs included gigs as an ironworker and a
fishing guide.;    "The moment I realized things were really taking off was in
May of '87, when I met Bill Ham (the Houston-based manager-producer of the
rock group ZZ Top). Right then I knew," said Black, who still lives in Houston
and is considering a second home in Nashville. "I called my mom and dad and
said 'this is it.' " Six months after his first meeting with Ham, Black was
signed to RCA.;    Black said his own biggest responsibility is building good,
radio-worthy songs. "A lot of times (a song) will just begin with a musical
idea; then I'll build the structure and add the lyrics," said Black. "In a few
cases, a page of lyrics come first, but for the most part, I look for the
musical hook. It's like a jigsaw puzzle: You lay all your pieces out, start
with the perimeter and work in from there.";    Up until now, longtime
guitarist and collaborator Hayden Nicholas shared writing credit on about half
of Black's recorded works. Black said he's also currently working with pop
writer Jerry Williams (whose works have been recorded by Eric Clapton and the
Fabulous Thunderbirds) and is planning to link up with middle-of-the-road
ballad-baron Michael Bolton at the end of March.;    "It'd be great (to have a
pop hit), but I'm not shootin' for that," Black said. "Radio's idea of what
fits a pop format is opening up -- thanks largely to people like the Eagles.
They proved you can use some country elements and make them fit on rock radio.
But I'd still probably have to change the instrumentation on my albums.";
Hunk appeal;  If Black's mass exposure came only through radio and CDs, it
would be easy to say his phenomenal appeal stems solely from his talent as a
great singer/songwriter. But there's something else at work in Black's case:
the Hunk Factor. Women -- and not just wailing teeny-boppers -- go wild over
the wide-shouldered, clean-cut honky-tonk hero. In a matter of months, Black
has elbowed his way into the country pantheon of male sex symbols that
includes Randy Travis, Ricky Van Shelton and George Strait. Last week, US
magazine proclaimed Black to be one of the world's 10 sexiest bachelors.;
"I try to stay out of the crowds, but onstage is different," said Black, who
seems genuinely perplexed by the Hunk Factor. "I'll never get used to it in
concert when they begin screaming like that. My drummer hears a lot of things,
and he tells me what the women are talking about," Black said, laughing. "He
says they're always talking about the eyes. I guess it worked for Roy Rogers,
right? And let's face it -- people like people who smile.";    Black's current
tour, which began two weeks ago in Fort Worth, Texas, is his first national
outing as a headline act. "When I was out with (the group) Alabama last year,
for the most part it was 10 months of working middle slot," said Black. "A lot
has changed, really, now that I'm closing the show. I've got my own stage, and
I even get to decide what we eat," he said, laughing.;    The main event;
When it came to discussing the support role living legend Merle Haggard plays
on this tour, Black was diplomatic: "Yeah, it feels strange, and it feels
great to be in this position. I'd never imagined that in all my years I would
see this. But if it were flipped around the other way, with me opening for
him, it'd still be great. It's just great to be closing the show, great to
know you're the reason that people came there.;    "There's no way I could
have known even three years ago what this was going to be like," said Black.
"I wish I had appreciated my obscurity more when I had it. I never thought I'd
long for the times I could go anywhere and just be a face in the crowd.
Really, I should have savored the days when I was just another smiling face.";
   After winning virtually every award in the industry as a freshman, what
conquest could possibly be left for the good guy in the black hat? "The road
-- that's the only thing. For now.";    Clint Black; With Merle Haggard and

Folk singer Tracy Chapman shuns the fame she quickly found after her 1988 debut
album soared to the top of the charts and won her three Grammy awards,
including best new artist.
</P>
<P>
"I guess if there were some way to choose what I wanted or didn't want from
what my success has brought me, I would choose not to have the celebrity,"
Chapman said in an interview in the March 12 issue of Time.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm very good at it."
</P>
<P>
Chapman's first album, "Tracy Chapman," hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts
and sold 10 million copies. Her second album, "Crossroads," has sold 4 million
copies since its release five months ago. The albums mix songs protesting
poverty and racism with love songs.
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who begins an American tour in May, said she is hurt by criticism of
her music by other blacks.
</P>
<P>
"There are people who have gone so far as to say that I'm not black or not part
of the black musical tradition," she said. "I think the reason I don't get
played on black radio stations is because I don't fit into their present
format.
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset by what has been said because it doesn't speak well of black people.
You know, it basically says black people don't respond in a cerebral manner to
music, and that's just not true."

<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, who
had a surprise hit with an album of ballads and protest songs and
crossover pop master George Michael are heavy favorites for multiple
nominations for the 31st annual Grammy Awards.
   The nominations were set for announcement Thursday morning at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel, when the results of nomination ballots sent to
more than 6,000 National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences
members will be read.
   Winners will be announced at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles
on Feb. 22 during a three-hour awards ceremony to be televised on
CBS at 8 p.m. EST. Pierre Cossette will produce the show.
   Miss Chapman, whose self-titled album has sold more than 2
million copies, was a surprise star of 1988 amid the techno-pop and
thriving heavy metal sounds.
   Her single ``Fast Car'' was a Top 10 hit, and the album had
several other nuggets. Nominations seem certain for best song, best
album, best single, best new artist, best female pop vocalist and
best contemporary folk performance.
   Michael's ``Faith'' LP has sold more than 6 million copies and
has spawned six hits, including several crossovers on both pop and
soul charts.
   Michael, whose musical style has changed considerably _ some
would say pretentiously, since the days when he was half of the pop
duo Wham! _ should be in line for best song, single and album and
best performance in one or all of the pop, rock and rhythm and blues
categories.
   Others to watch for are nominations for vocal gymnast Bobby
McFerrin, his ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' single and ``Simple
Pleasures,'' LP; the Beach Boys, who have never won a competitive
Grammy, getting another chance with the song ``Kokomo;'' and
possible multiple nods to Steve Winwood for his ``Roll With It''
song and LP; and INXS for their ``Kick'' album and ``Need You
Tonight-Mediate'' single; and Terence Trent D'Arby's debut album.
   Forecasting Grammy nominees and winners is no longer the easy job
it once was, agreed Billboard magazine columnist Paul Grein, who
said the changes in NARAS have become the most apparent over the
past five years.
   ``The academy has recruited many new members, most of them
younger and more ready to give rock its due,'' Grein said Wednesday.
``It's much harder now to get a handle on what they do. Once it was
pretty easy to just line up whoever fit in the Barbra
Streisand-Doobie Brothers-Billy Joel middle of the road form. Now
those acts still do well, but they also recognize rock acts like
Prince, U2, and Bruce Springsteen.''
   The Grammy nominations for an all-time high 76 categories were
culled this year from a record 6,800 entries released between Oct.
1, 1987, and Sept. 30, 1988.
   The membership of NARAS includes certified musicians who have had
their work recorded and distributed, recording engineers and other
technicians as well as music executives and others associated with
the music industry.
   Besides hard rock-heavy metal and rap, best bluegrass was added
as a new award for 1989, and a new fusion field was established by
the academy for the existing categories of best jazz fusion
performance and best new age performance.

<HEAD>Obscenity Debate Over Group's Recording Reaches Federal Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate over whether the lyrics
of a recording by the million-selling rap group 2 Live Crew are
obscene moved to a higher level today with the issue's first airing
in federal court.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine if ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which has been removed from store shelves
in several Florida counties, should also be banned in Broward
County.
   The county ordered the ban. Lawyers for the Miami-based group
then asked Gonzalez to lift the ban.
   The first witness to testify today, Broward Detective Sgt. Mark
Wichner, said he found the recording ``extremely explicit and
degrading to the female sex.''
   The detective sought and received a ruling from a circuit judge
that it was probably obscene. Then, he said he visited Fort
Lauderdale-area record stores, warning personnel they could be
prosecuted on obscenity charges for selling the recording.
   On cross-examination, 2 Live Crew lawyer Bruce Rogow said the
sheriff's office file on the recording contained ``not one
complaint'' from a citizen of Broward County about it. He argued
that the police investigation had revealed nothing indicating the
recording violated community standards of obscenity.
   Three of the group's four members _ David Hobbs, whose stage
name is Mr. Mixx; Chris Wongwon, known as Fresh Kid Ice; and Mark
Ross, who performs as Brother Marquis _ were present for the
trial's start.
   Leader Luther Campbell was expected later, said Debbie Bennett,
a spokeswoman for the group's record company. Campbell has used the
name Luke Skyywalker but is currently prohibited from doing so
pending settlement of a lawsuit by the creators of the ``Star
Wars'' movies.
   John Jolly, attorney for the Broward Sheriff's Office, said
before the trial that the purpose of the case ``is to tell us if it
is protected First Amendment speech or disposable, unprotected
smut.''
   ``The tape speaks for itself,'' Jolly said.
   But there's merit to what it says, according to Rogow.
   ``Put in its historical context, it is a novel and creative use
of sound and lyrics,'' he said. He plans to call music critics to
testify about the artistic value of the recording.
   ``The trouble is you have a bunch of white folks who don't
understand the culture,'' Rogow said. ``The primary reason for
writing these songs was humor, to make people think and reflect the
kind of talk that occurs in the community where the four people who
make up 2 Live Crew have lived all their lives.''
   The album ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' has sold nearly 2
million copies, while a toned-down version of the album has sold
about 300,000 copies.

   Singer Hopes
   Role in Comics
   Makes Her a Star

   NEW YORK -- Call it "Madonna meets Wonder Woman on Wall
Street."
   By day, the new Marvel comic book heroine Nightcat has a
gig as aspiring pop singer Jacqueline Tavarez. By night, she
stalks the city in skin-tight leather and slices up bad guys.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In real life, though, Jackie Tavarez actually is a
struggling singer who performs under the moniker Nightcat.
Her promoters, trying to get her noticed, have linked her
image to an alter-ego super heroine, signing Marvel Comics
legend Stan Lee to create a comic book all her own.
   Sound weird? There's more. Ms. Tavarez's backers have set
up a publicly held company, dubbed Black Cat Entertainment
Co., to profit from her many exploits. In addition to the
live performer and the comic book, there is a Nightcat record
album, and a video is in the works. "It's as if Madonna were
a public company," says Black Cat's chairman, Charles Stein.
   Except that Jackie Tavarez is a long way from being a pop
star. Her debut album still hasn't sold out its first run of
just 25,000 copies.
   But the new comic book has the makings of a hit.
Nightcat's premiere issue, which went on sale in early April,
has already sold out its initial run of 70,000 copies. For
the debut issue of a $3.95 heavystock book, that is "a very
good, strong sale," says a spokeswoman for Marvel Comics. A
typical Spiderman or Superman, by comparison, might sell half
a million copies but retails for only $1 and is printed on
cheaper paper.
   The idea of making a comic book character a pop star isn't
new. More than two decades ago, "Archie" gave rise to the
Archies, who sang one of the most saccharine hits of all
time, "Sugar, Sugar." In the late '70s, going in reverse,
Marvel produced a series of comic books based on the
heavymetal band Kiss. And this year, Time Warner Inc.'s DC
Comics unit is creating a fantasy comic book for rock star
Prince, who tours this summer.
   Buyers of the premiere issue of "Nightcat" get lots of
violence, a little bondage, the obligatory mad scientist --
and plenty of skin. The heroine wears thigh-high stiletto
boots and a skimpy, black leather top that laces up the
center, similar to the get-up Ms. Tavarez wears -- in real
life -- on stage. "It looks like an S&amp;M outfit," the
21-yearold singer concedes.
   In the first issue's climactic scene, Nightcat, armed with
new powers after an accidental injection of "cat serum,"
battles a scantily clad villainess on the roof of a
skyscraper to avenge her father's death. "I dunno, for a
modern, happening chick, you sure sound like a dork]" the
Nightcat taunts. "Now that we've finished discussing my
verbal proclivities," her nemesis retorts, "you may prepare
to die]"
   If the project catches on, Black Cat Entertainment could
post some pretty profits. The comic book market this year is
expected to approach $500 million at retail, according to
Comics Buyer's Guide. A strong character can sell up to
500,000 copies a month.
   More importantly, the typical comic-book buyer is likely
to be part of the biggest chunk of the music-buying market:
males from teen-agers to 30-year-olds. The new company will
get a 5% share of comic-book sales and an 8% cut of album
revenue. The singer herself receives a fourth of Black Cat's
take.
   The comic book promotion was the brainchild of Ms.
Tavarez's manager, Don Kessler. He approached Mr. Lee, the
chairman of Marvel Comics and creator of the Incredible Hulk,
Spidey and a passel of other super heroes.
   Mr. Lee met with the young singer and immediately felt she
had "something feline-seeming" about her. The story line uses
the singer's real name and has her sing lyrics from her
songs. It also engages in a bit of wishful thinking, with one
page showing the Nightcat gracing magazine covers, including
Time's. And it introduces a funky new sound effect --
"Snik-Snik," when Nightcat unleashes her talons.
   Ms. Tavarez, for her part, had wanted to be a journalist.
But she found success in modeling in high school, making her
mark saying "Fayva wow]" in TV commercials for the shoe
company.
   The aspiring singer, who was born in the Dominican
Republic and raised in the tough Bushwick section of
Brooklyn, gushes at the chance to "express myself for good
things." In subsequent issues of the comic book, she says,
she hopes to focus more on her Hispanic background and
address more socially significant issues.

CRASH MAY PUT NEW BILLY IDOL ALBUM, MOVIE ROLE ON HOLD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Billy Idol's motorcycle accident Tuesday morning occurred just hours after the
rock star finished his first album in more than three years and just five weeks
before he was to begin his co-starring role in an Oliver Stone film about Jim
Morrison, the controversial lead singer of the Doors rock band.
</P>
<P>
The British-born Idol (real name: William Broad) broke his right leg and left
forearm when he went through a stop sign in Hollywood and crashed into a moving
automobile, said Los Angeles police. Though he was not wearing a helmet, there
were no serious head injuries.
</P>
<P>
Idol's publicist, Ellen Golden, said Wednesday that the singer, 34, had taken a
long time on the new album because he viewed it as a transitional work that he
hoped would expand his audience from his largely teen rock following to include
a more adult crowd.
</P>
<P>
"The record is definitely his most mature and honest record," Golden said
describing "Charmed Life," which is scheduled to be released in April. "He
refers to himself directly a lot on it. He's very proud of what he has to say."
</P>
<P>
A national tour was to follow the album's release.
</P>
<P>
How the injuries will affect these plans was still uncertain Wednesday. Idol
was described by a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman as in serious but
stable condition following a seven-hour operation Tuesday involving three
orthopedic surgeons.
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Idol would probably remain hospitalized for up
to two weeks. His need for physical therapy or further treatment had not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
"Working in his favor is that he's young and healthy and athletic," said Wise,
who added that Idol was awake and alert Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Idol's last album, not counting a greatest hits package, was 1986's "Whiplash
Smile," which sold more than 1 million copies and represented a preliminary
step away from the flashy, rebellious near-punk image he'd courted since his
days leading the late-'70s London band Generation X. His best-known solo hits
include "White Wedding," "Rebel Yell" and the 1986 Top 10 selection, "To Be a
Lover."
</P>
<P>
Though he still invariably appeared in black leather and studs, a seemingly
permanent sneer on his face, "Whiplash Smile" presented him as a maturing
artist.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Idol has been a fixture in Los Angeles, often seen at local
music clubs where he sometimes spontaneously took the stage for late-night jam
sessions. He was also one of many celebrity Harley-Davidson riders, seen in the
company of the likes of Mickey Rourke and Gary Busey, who himself had a serious
crash in late 1988. Idol performed at a November 1988 benefit to help track
down the hit-and-run driver who killed a cycle-riding friend of his.

   A judge's obscenity ruling against a 2 Live Crew rap
album has no legal effect outside south Florida, where a record
store owner was arrested today, but civil libertarians see a
practical effect spreading nationally.
   ``This does pose a real threat that the amount of obscenity
actions may increase around the country,'' New York attorney Floyd
Abrams, a First Amendment expert, said Thursday. ``It is a direct
threat to freedom of expression in the arts, as well as in music in
particular.''
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday that the lyrics
of the Miami group's sexually explicit album ``As Nasty As They Want
To Be'' are obscene, leaving area retailers liable for arrest for
sales of the platinum-selling record.
   Today, a Fort Lauderdale area record store owner was arrested on
an obscenity charge after selling the album. Broward County
sheriff's deputies arrested E-C Records owner Charles Freeman at his
store less than three hours after he received a shipment of 25
copies.
   ``America is free, free for everybody,'' Freeman said. ``And as
long as this is America and I'm not living in Cuba, I feel my rights
are violated.''
   An undercover officer went in to buy copies of the record and
tape, then uniformed officers entered the store to make the arrest.
   ``I would have to say that the research and the consultation that
we were doing has apparently been concluded and we're prepared to
enforce it,'' sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal said minutes after
the arrest.
   Before authorities arrived, Freeman said he had sold all but six
copies of the recording. He said a line had formed outside the shop
in anticipation of the shipment's arrival.
   ``I'll go to jail, and I'll come back and sell it again,'' he
said before deputies arrived. ``I opened up a record store three
years ago expecting to sell records and this was the furthest thing
from my mind.''
   Asked why he would challenge the ban, Freeman explained: ``I'm a
small independent. All my money is going to be made on R&amp;B and rap,
so it'll hurt me in the long run.''
   The recording industry generally favors warning stickers on album
covers to bring attention to lyrics that some might consider
objectionable.
   But Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, said he hoped the specter of censorship
raised by the Fort Lauderdale ruling would act as a unifying force.
   ``This ruling, alongside the chilling lyrics legislation which is
making the rounds through the statehouses nationwide, must serve as
a call to mobilize all who value basic artistic freedom and who are
willing to tenaciously fight for the protection of First Amendment
rights,'' Greene said.
   Bruce Jesse, vice president of advertising and sales promotion
for the 265-store Wherehouse record store chain based in Los
Angeles, concluded, ``You're putting the retailer at a significant
risk.''
   But Bruce Fein, former counsel general of the Federal
Communications Commission, saw a limited impact, saying, ``I don't
think this sets a nationwide precedent that will cause all off-color
rock music to be banned.''
   Supplies of 2 Live Crew's disputed record dried up in South
Florida as the obscenity case was argued, but the decision is widely
expected to boost sales elsewhere.
   ``The lesson of history has always been, if you tell people you
can't have anything, they want it all the more,'' said Nova
University law professor Bruce Rogow. He represented 2 Live Crew in
its lawsuit against Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro over his
threat to prosecute retailers.
   The decision had no effect on the group's plans for two shows
Saturday night at Club Futura in nearby Hollywood.
   Club owner Kenneth Gerringer told City Council members Thursday
that the opening show would be a tame performance for all age
groups, and he would ask the rappers to shun explicit lyrics in the
later adults-only show.
   Ten uniformed police officers will be working inside and outside
the club, primarily for crowd control, said Paul Dungan,
administrative assistant to the police chief, who was out of town.
   ``We're handling this as if Michael Jackson were coming to town,
or Dean Martin or any of the top stars,'' he said. ``I would not
advise officers to go up on the stage and arrest four people in
front of 1,000 people.''
   But Mayor Sal Oliveri gave Gerringer a stern warning to pass
along to 2 Live Crew, saying, ``Artist or no artist, I don't want
Hollywood to have the reputation, in my opinion, that we have
obscene entertainment.''

FT  28 DEC 94 / Record industry's heart develops healthier beat: The new
Beatles album is just one of the reasons why sales have rebounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives of EMI Records knew they had a hit on their hands last month when
they launched a rare Beatles recording, Live At The BBC. But they never
thought it would sell nearly 1m copies in its first month.
Live At The BBC is not the only success on the UK music scene. Album and
singles sales rose by 12.5 per cent in the year to October, according to the
British Phonographic Industry. Early estimates suggest Christmas sales could
be 20 per cent up on last year.
Record companies are also basking in the success of UK acts - such as Take
That, East 17, Blur, Oasis and Eternal - in the continental European market.
This rosy picture could not be more different from that of a few years ago
when the industry was mired in recession and haunted by legal and regulatory
problems.
The music market declined steadily in the early 1990s with album sales
falling from 163m in 1989 to 134m by 1992, British Phonographic Industry
statistics show. The record companies also faced the dual threat of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact disc pricing and the
legal attempt by George Michael, the singer, to end his contract with Sony.
These threats have evaporated. The MMC found in the industry's favour and
George Michael lost his case. The latest probe into the music business - the
MMC's investigation into the Performing Right Society, the body that
collects royalties for composers - will not affect the record companies.
The economic environment has also improved. Music is traditionally a leading
indicator, emerging from recession earlier than other consumer sectors, and
its recovery from the early 1990s recession has been accelerated by other
factors such as demographic trends and technological changes.
The growth in the number of teenagers, the prime purchasers of singles, has
triggered a revival in teen phenomena such as Take That and East 17. Both
bands have had a string of hits and become the most successful teen acts
since David Cassidy, the Osmonds and the Bay City Rollers back in the 1970s.
The record companies have also invested in new alternative acts such as
Oasis and Blur. These bands have more critical kudos than Take That and East
17, which might help them to last longer. They have also enjoyed healthy
sales. Blur's Parklife album has sold 500,000 copies since its September
debut.
The jungle dance craze which started in the London clubs has been bombarded
by media attention in the US and UK. Record companies have been signing up
jungle acts in the expectation that it will become a commercial phenomenon
next year.
Meanwhile the industry continues to benefit from increased sales to age
groups which grew up in the vibrant pop culture of the 1960s and 1970s. Some
of the most successful 1994 releases have been aimed at this age group.
REM's Monster sold 200,000 copies in its first week - more than any album
for five years - when it came out in September. The 'greatest hits'
compilations by Bon Jovi and the Beautiful South have been among the
best-sellers this Christmas.
Live At The BBC is even better news for retailers, as it attracts older
consumers who do not normally buy albums. EMI's compact disc plant has been
working round-the-clock to satisfy demand. Mr Brian McLaughlin, managing
director of the HMV chain, said his shops were still selling 'as many copies
as we can lay our hands on'.
The popularity of compact disc players is also boosting music sales. Some 40
per cent of UK homes now have compact disc machines and consumers are
replacing their record collections by buying old favourites on disc,
increasing sales of classic rock, jazz and classical music.
The outlook is even brighter on the international front. UK acts are
well-established on the Continent and are starting to regain the ground they
lost in the US in the early 1990s due to the popularity of American
phenomena such as country music, rap and grunge rock.
Country and grunge are waning, making it easier for UK acts to make their
mark in the US, by far the world's largest pop market. This means that their
UK record companies can earn royalties on their North American sales.
Take That is being primed for a US debut next autumn. Mr John Preston,
chairman of the UK subsidiary of BMG, its record company, said: 'The US is
such an important market and Take That is such a big act that we want to get
it right first time. If we do, the upside is stupendous.'

<LEADPARA>  ON THE surface, it doesn't make sense. Why the sudden deluge of boxed sets
during a recession? Phil Spector, the Monkees, Fats Domino, King Crimson and
Bob Marley are among the latest acts to get boxed, while Aerosmith, Lynyrd
Skynyrd and Jeff Beck boxes are close behind. Since these are generally
high-ticket items selling for $30 to $60 apiece, isn't that a bit obscene
during tough times?;   No! the record industry is shouting.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OLD ROCKERS FIND HEAVEN IN A BOX
CD SETS ARE MAJOR MONEYMAKERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Recordings  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The truth is that archival boxed sets are here to stay. Although they come
in multiple-CD packages that look costly to produce, they're often far more
profitable than single albums by new, unknown bands. Fans of new music can
gripe all they want about dollars being siphoned off by these dinosaur-band
boxes, but their pleas will fall on deaf ears.;   "Boxed sets make money. It's
as simple as that," says PolyGram's Bill Levenson, who won a Grammy for
producing Eric Clapton's "Crossroads" box.;   New acts get a break;   "These
sets pay the bills," adds Levenson. "And in a way, they can help new acts. The
profits allow record companies to take a chance on new acts that might have a
1-in-20 shot of making it. Obviously, if you put out a box on Crosby, Stills &amp;
Nash, you'll get a different audience than someone who buys into Jane's
Addiction. Chances are that many Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash fans are not into new
music. So you're not losing a sale. You're making a new sale.";   That logic
becomes more evident if you check the figures. A major record label typically
spends $200,000-$300,000, including video costs, to release an album by a new
act, of which the vast majority will flop. But boxed sets, since the music has
already been previously recorded, cost an average of $100,000, mostly for
remastering and the obligatory, magazine-like booklet. Promotion costs are
also low, since the acts are usually well-known and not in need of hype.;
The lower overhead makes all the difference. "Once you've sold 10,000-20,000
units of a boxed set, you've recouped your money," says Levenson.;   The
numbers often far exceed that. Clapton's "Crossroads" has sold 600,000 copies
in three years. Bob Dylan's "Biograph," the 1985 package that started the
craze, has topped 500,000. But the biggest so far is Led Zeppelin's "Led
Zeppelin," with more than 750,000 sales since its release last year. Because a
record label typically makes $10 per box, the profits can be astronomical.;
It doesn't take a crystal ball to see why many more boxes are on the way.
Levenson is working on a four-CD Moody Blues box for the spring. Elsewhere,
new boxes are coming within the month on Howlin' Wolf, Judy Garland, Chicago,
the Carpenters, Jimi Hendrix, Lou Reed and Les Paul.;   Another marketing ploy
-- double CDs as opposed to four-CD boxes -- is gaining momentum. Rhino
Records just released a double CD, "The Best of Alternative Rock," from MTV's
"120 Minutes" program. Featured tracks are by R.E.M., Sinead O'Connor and
Robyn Hitchcock. Recent double CDs from Quicksilver Messenger Service, Spirit
and Poco have hit the stores; and future double CDs are being mulled for
Fairport Convention, Free, Spooky Tooth and the Strawbs.;   The double CD is
for acts that don't have the material to justify the three-to-four-CD boxes.
They also come at an in-between price -- $20 to $30 -- to make them more
affordable. Some have sold briskly, such as Rush's "Chronicles," which has
moved 500,000 copies.;   Led Zep leads the way;   Of the larger format boxes,
the best so far are the aforementioned Zeppelin box (digitally remastered by
Zep's Jimmy Page, though there's only one previously unreleased track),
Dylan's "Bootleg Series" (the follow-up to "Biograph," it contains two dozen
previously unreleased acoustic takes), the Byrds' "The Byrds" (a generous
90-song set) and Little Richard's "The Specialty Sessions," containing some
hilarious studio repartee.;   Worth avoiding, however, are Jimi Hendrix's
"Lifelines," a haphazard collection that came out last year; and the Allman
Brothers' "Dreams," which has too many live tracks that have been heard on
other albums, along with some members' pre-Allman tunes that should have
stayed buried in the vaults. (Consumers must agree, because the Allmans' box
has sold 150,000 copies -- a disappointment for a group of such popularity.)

   Gretchen Polhemus, Miss USA 1989, has some
advice for her newly crowned successor: Get a lawyer.
   Polhemus said in an interview published Sunday she was required
to work 12-hour days during her reign, hadn't received all her
prizes and was denied permission to visit her sick grandmother.
   Miss Polhemus told The Wichita Eagle she considered quitting at
one point.
   The new Miss USA, Carole Gist, 20, of Detroit, was crowned
Friday at the pageant finals in Wichita.
   ``I told her to get an attorney. There's a lot of things in that
contract that are unclear,'' Miss Polhemus said.
   Pageant spokeswoman Sara Meza said pageant officials
renegotiated Miss Polhemus' contract to give her more days off
after she complained.
   Ms. Meza said the $1,300 in wardrobe expense money, $3,000 worth
of airline tickets and some camera equipment will be delivered in
two weeks. She said Miss Polhemus would have gotten the prizes even
without the new agreement.
   Miss Polhemus also said she wasn't allowed to visit her sick
grandmother in Arlington, Texas, as preparations were under way for
this year's pageant. The grandmother has suffered three strokes,
she said.
   ``I just wanted to tell her I love her,'' Miss Polhemus said.
   Miss Meza said she didn't realize the grandmother was that sick.

   Folk singer Tracy Chapman shuns the fame she
quickly found after her 1988 debut album soared to the top of the
charts and won her three Grammy awards, including best new artist.
   ``I guess if there were some way to choose what I wanted or
didn't want from what my success has brought me, I would choose not
to have the celebrity,'' Chapman said in an interview in the March
12 issue of Time.
   ``I don't think I'm very good at it.''
   Chapman's first album, ``Tracy Chapman,'' hit No. 1 on the
Billboard pop charts and sold 10 million copies. Her second album,
``Crossroads,'' has sold 4 million copies since its release five
months ago. The albums mix songs protesting poverty and racism with
love songs.
   Chapman, who begins an American tour in May, said she is hurt by
criticism of her music by other blacks.
   ``There are people who have gone so far as to say that I'm not
black or not part of the black musical tradition,'' she said. ``I
think the reason I don't get played on black radio stations is
because I don't fit into their present format. And they're not
willing to make a space for me.
   ``I'm upset by what has been said because it doesn't speak well
of black people,'' Chapman said. ``You know, it basically says
black people don't respond in a cerebral manner to music, and
that's just not true.''

   Sammy Davis Jr., fighting cancer and unable
to travel to St. Louis for the annual charity telethon that bears
his name, called from a hospital to rally fund-raisers.
   Davis, who has been hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
battling a recurrence of throat cancer, promised on Sunday to be
back in St. Louis in 1991 to again host the Sammy Davis Jr. Variety
Club Telethon.
   ``You're always there for me and next year I will be in St.
Louis with you. Let's do it for the kids,'' Davis said.
   The telethon, in its seventh year, raises money for more than
150 children's organizations in the St. Louis area. Last year it
raised $2.6 million, said Davis' spokeswoman, Susan Reynolds.
   ``The organizers of the telethon said that after the phone call
their operators were just flooded with calls,'' the spokeswoman
added. The show, featuring such celebrities as Angie Dickinson,
John Forsythe, Lou Rawls and Perry Como, was on the air in the St.
Louis area throughout the day.
   Davis hopes to leave Cedars-Sinai Medical Center soon, although
no release date has been set.
   ``The doctors are encouraged by the progress they are seeing and
he continues to get stronger every day,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ``He's
been going down the corridors, talking to patients.''

<HEAD>Muscovites Flock to Record Stores for Western Rock Album</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Soviet rock music fans thronged record
stores in a snowstorm to buy a new album by some of the West's
biggest stars and carry home autographs of the likes of British
rocker Peter Gabriel.
   The album, with music by two dozen Western musicians, was
produced by Greenpeace, the international environmental group.
Millions of dollars from its sales will go toward fighting
environmental problems in the Soviet Union.
   The hoopla was especially great Monday on Moscow's Kalinin
Prospekt outside the Melodiya store, where Gabriel and Annie Lennox
of the Eurythmics autographed copies of ``Breakthrough.''
   The album also contains music by artists including U2, Sting, the
Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Huey Lewis and the News, Bruce Hornsby
and the Range, Sade, John Cougar Mellencamp and Dire Straits.
   At the Kalinin store, a police guard was posted at the door, and
a steel barricade was set up on the sidewalk as young Soviets
wearing traditional Russian fur hats and Western-style ski caps
massed.
   Melodiya, the name of the state's record company as well as
record stores, is known for small pressings of popular albums,
especially rock, and the initial pressing of 500,000 copies of
``Breakthrough'' was likely to last just a couple of days _ if not
hours. Melodiya plans to release 3 million copies, as well as
500,000 cassettes, in this country of 285 million people.
   A black market for Western rock recordings thrives in the Soviet
Union, and even Melodiya Director Valery Sukharado admitted to
reporters, ``I don't know how many (copies) will be released on the
black market.''
   The two-record album carries a compilation of songs previously
issued in the West by the individuals and groups. International
release is scheduled for April 25.
   Sukharado said Melodiya will donate about $16 million from record
sales to a Moscow-based charity that is working with Greenpeace on
environmental problems in the Soviet Union.
   Peter Bahouth, the executive director of the Greenpeace branch in
the United States, said his organization plans to open an office in
Moscow.
   Some of the rock stars told a news conference here that they were
surprised at how well rock is known in the Soviet Union, where the
music was once condemned as ``decadent'' and kept underground.
   Now, the sounds of Dire Straits or Soviet pop stars like Black
Coffee are heard on once-staid official Radio Moscow.
   Jerry Harrison, keyboard player for the Talking Heads, said he
and several other Western musicians visited a rock music center
Sunday night in Gorky Park and saw Soviet musicians who had made
their own instruments.
   ``That shows how much the kids in the Soviet Union want to play
rock music and are interested in it,'' Harrison said.
   Gabriel said he liked several Soviet rock groups and quipped,
``This is the best way to conquer the West.''
   He said he learned during his visit that one of his albums had
been released in the Soviet Union and ``found the fans here very
warm, friendly and generous.'' Gabriel said he would like to perform
in the Soviet Union next year if his band is ready.

   Older Rebel Does Own Thing

   New York -- When Richie Havens sang "Freedom" at Woodstock
in 1969, little did he know that 21 years later it would
still be his biggest hit. But his Woodstock-earned reputation
has allowed him to parlay singing into his own sort of
freedom: the chance to do what he wants.
   Sitting in his company's midtown Manhattan office
recently, Havens, an imposing but friendly figure with hands
full of rings, expounded on music, a new album due out next
month, television and radio ads, environmental projects and
philosophy, always philosophy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the subject of Woodstock, Havens said he wishes the
event was more understood. "Kids are discovering Woodstock
every day . . . It's been a 20-year job for me just defending
Woodstock's actuality." Folklore has it that Woodstock was
his big break, but Havens stressed that he had performed
overseas by 1969 and had done albums by then. Nevertheless,
the legendary outdoor concert certainly didn't hurt his
popularity, and he was the first performer on stage, thanks
to a twist of fate. "I went on first because there was no one
else there to go on," he said. All the other groups were
still stuck in traffic.
   Havens is a man who insists he's happy scrambling. At 49,
he claims fans of all ages and appears at jazz, rock, folk
and blues concerts. But he hasn't always enjoyed big
financial success with his records. "So many companies," he
said; "the minute I put out an album they go out of
business." But, he added, "I don't need a record to allow me
to work."
   A guitarist/singer who performs with backup guitar or
four-piece band, Havens has done 19 albums, three of them
gold (sales of more than 500,000). He has also done
soundtracks for the television program "The Wonder Years" and
the film "Coming Home." One of his latest albums, "Simple
Things" (RBI), sold more than 100,000 copies in the U.S.
after it was issued two years ago, but then RBI folded. He
reissued the record in Europe recently on his own ELO label
and it sold 40,000 copies in Italy alone.
   These are not astounding figures. Indeed, Havens's career
has been a tepid affair since the '60s, perhaps because of
the kind of music he performs. "Richie Havens is essentially
an interpretive singer in the folk genre," said Rolling
Stone's Anthony DeCurtis, the point being that interpretive
singers in the folk genre didn't ship much platinum in the
'70s and '80s. But Havens stayed alive and his number may be
coming up again, in the wake of recent successes by folky
artists such as Tracy Chapman. Mr. DeCurtis thinks it's "not
impossible for Richie Havens to stage a comeback."
   Johanan Vigoda, the Los Angeles co-producer of Havens's
upcoming album, called "Richie Havens Now," has his sights
set high for a commercial success. The album, which will
include a Jimi Hendrix song, one Cyndi Lauper tune and eight
to 10 originals, will be released by Solar Records, a soul
label distributed by CBS. That, Mr. DeCurtis remarked, should
be a boost to Havens, who has suffered in the past under
smaller labels that lacked marketing and promotion clout. "A
lot of people have heard of him, but have never heard him,"
said Mr. Vigoda, a long-time industry hand who represents
Stevie Wonder.
   Actually, millions have heard Havens without knowing it.
He sings jingles for a variety of commercials. The Woodstock
rebel's voice now hymns Amtrak, Folgers coffee, Bell
Atlantic, MasterCard, Kodak and others. He won a 1990 Clio
award for an ad he sung for the cotton industry.
   "I like Richie Havens," said Amtrak spokesman Clifford
Black. "Havens's voice gives {the ad} a signature that makes
it special."
   The jingle business can bring a volume singer in New York
as much as $10,000 under union scale in residuals over the
life of a commercial. Havens earns over scale, industry
executives say. And, added Mr. DeCurtis, Havens's jingles are
"very lucrative," noting "no one's going to have to take up a
collection for Richie Havens." Havens himself downplays the
part played by jingles in his current career: "Every jingle
house calls me up and I refuse most. It's not my business.
The ads are projects. I support my own ideas in that kind of
way."
   Havens does indeed seem to be constantly in motion, doing
concerts "all over the planet" every weekend in large and
small settings. His recent schedule included a trip to Prague
for two days for an Italian television special with Joe
Cocker and Billy Preston, then California a few days later.
He also performed at a concert honoring Nelson Mandela in New
York earlier this year.
   Time was, of course, he was on the road every day, but he
says he has cut his traveling to three or four days a week,
to leave time for a variety of projects. The North Wind
Underseas Institute on New York's City Island, which he
co-founded, developed a device to rescue whales and teaches
harbor seals to rescue people trapped underwater. He is also
starting a cable project called Weekend Future Television.
   If the new album takes off, the only thing Havens will
have to worry about is another jingle singer who imitates the
Havens voice so well that "a lot of times I thought it was
me, too."

   Black men dominated for ever so long.
   But now black women are coming on strong.


   PITTSBURGH -- Backed by an all-girl band at the Syria
Mosque concert hall here, Salt and Pepa are acting out their
rap "Independent." The two young women swing briefcases and
pretend they're heading off to work, while they yell at two
men in aprons, "Those dishes better be washed]"
   They rap about making money and not needing to lean on
men. "You had to cross me, and now you lost me," one of the
women chants. "Get off me, softy. I'm the boss, see?"
   Teen-age girls in the audience are nodding, chanting and
raising their fists. Jada James, an 18-year-old fan who works
in a Pittsburgh blood bank, says approvingly of the women on
stage, "They have made it in a man's world, which rap is."
   Or was. Salt-N-Pepa has sold 3.5 million albums since
1987, including the memorably titled "A Salt With a Deadly
Pepa." Its success is credited for spawning an industry rush
to sign other promising women.
   After more than a decade of explosive sales growth for
male rappers, women are a hot commodity. In fact, some are
positively steamy.
   There is, for instance, the group Hoes Wit Attitude, whose
first rap album was the scene setter, "Livin' in a Hoe
House." A typical performance begins when the three women
rappers strut onto a smoke-shrouded stage wearing mink coats.
As the smoke lifts, so do the clothes -- the three strip off
their minks to reveal skimpy black-leather bikinis studded
with rhinestones.
   Their raps, with titles like "Trick Is a Trick," exhaust
the rhyming possibilities of four-letter words, but not the
fans: The Hoes' first album has sold 100,000 copies in its
first eight months.
   Although the audience may be tickled by such risque raps,
some of the female trailblazers in the genre are not.
   Salt and Pepa, for instance, when interviewed backstage
after their act in Pittsburgh, slam their bikini-clad
competitors. "Explicit lyrics just aren't ladylike," says
Salt, a former Sears telephone clerk from New York's Queens
borough whose real name is Cheryl James. "Cursing and
carrying on and saying every disgusting thing is just a
gimmick."
   Gimmick or no, the gutter girls are a growing fad in one
of the trendiest corners of the fad-hungry commercial music
world. Already the Hoes have company. A duo called "Bytches
With Problems" (BWP for short) released its first album of
filthy lyrics in February; it sold 80,000 copies in its first
week.
   But some critics, such as Dream Hampton, who writes for a
rap magazine called The Source, have been outraged by the
Hoes' lyrics. Scandalized by a rap about a sex hotline which
includes the line: "Poor Mandela, just gettin' home, calling
up a hoe on the telephone," Ms. Hampton asked in her review,
"Is nothing sacred]?]" She went on to attack the group for
perpetuating "negative stereotypes of women" and marketing
themselves "like extras in a porn flick."
   The controversy has hit academia, too. At a recent
conference at Howard University on "hip hop," as black pop
cultural expressions like break-dancing, graffiti and rap are
called, both the Hoes and the Bytches withdrew from a panel
about explicit women rappers. The Hoes' spokesman said one of
the women was sick. But the Bytches' manager admitted he was
fearful of a confrontation. The meeting might have become a
verbal brawl if the groups had come, concedes Aarian Pope,
one of the student organizers of the conference.
   "There were people who came to curse these sisters out,"
says Ms. Pope. "These {groups} are being irresponsible.
They're making money, but with all the other problems of the
black community, we don't need these negative women
disrespecting themselves. Other panelists told fans at the
conference: `Don't buy this stuff.'"
   The hostilities are also spilling over into the music. A
rapper felicitously named Harmony knocked risque women
rappers on her album last fall -- though her choice of words
wasn't exactly pristine. "I ain't no slut that sells records
with her butt," goes one line. Harmony, whose real name is
Pamela Scott, says, "We need to lift ourselves up and move to
more positive things. Why be a `bitch with a problem'? If you
had a problem, wouldn't you want to solve it?"
   The Bytches and Hoes don't even have nice things to say
about each other. Lyndah and Tanisha Michelle, who perform in
street clothes as the Bytches, say, "We're not trying to sell
records with sex like the Hoes: We're selling reality."
   The Hoes counter: "I'd rather be someone making money than
another word for dog."
   Both groups insist they're actually true feminists: trying
to present an image of women as strong, successful and in
control.
   "So someone calls you a bitch?" says Tanisha of BWP.
"That's what they call any woman who's tough and good at
business. We say, wear the title as a badge of honor and keep
getting yours."
   And Kim "Baby Girl" Kenner, leader of the Hoes, says that
growing up on the south side of Chicago, she and her
girlfriends called each other "hoe" as a joking term of
familiarity and she doesn't regard it as degrading. The
25-year-old says she was selling real estate for Century-21
in Chicago when she started the group, first called Sleaze
Patrol, with her sister and her cousin. "They use sexy women
to sell cars -- what's wrong with being sexy to sell
records?" she asks.
   Some industry insiders dismiss these foul-mouthed ladies
as mere copycats whose labels are trying to capitalize on
last year's controversy over harshly explicit albums by
groups like 2 Live Crew, Geto Boys and NWA (which stands for
"Niggers With Attitude"). These male groups perform so-called
gangster rap, a violent, misogynistic depiction of gang life
in the housing projects.
   A staple of gangster rap is graphic revenge fantasies
about rival gangs, women and police. The Bytches, for
instance, just bought the exclusive rights to the widely
shown home videotape of the Los Angeles police beating a
black motorist, which they want for the video version of
their rap single about police brutality "Wanted."
   The Bytches also have two raps about killing men. In one,
"Comin' Back Strapped," the girls execute some men in a
drive-by shooting because one guy makes a suggestive remark.
   "Right now, it's still a novelty to have women rappers
saying the outrageous things guys said before," says Janine
McAdams, R&amp;B music editor for Billboard magazine. "But except
for a few adolescents who always have to buy what's illicit,
I'm betting that sex rap will fall by the wayside."
   Even if that happens, some of the more reputable female
rappers may still be standing. One is likely to be Queen
Latifah (la-TEE-fah), a big-boned 20-year-old from Newark,
N.J., known for her African turbans and crowns. She sells out
concerts in Europe and Japan and has lectured at Harvard. Her
first album, "All Hail the Queen," has sold more than a
million copies world-wide since its release a year and a half
ago.
   So it seems that women rappers are here to stay -- and
even the most notorious gangster rappers are wising up to
that. On his album "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted," rapper "Ice
Cube" asks "Yo-Yo," a 19-year-old woman rapper with a
feminist slant, to duel with him verbally in a number called
"It's a Man's World."
   In the refrain, Ice Cube says, "This is a man's world,
thank you very much," and Yo-Yo replies: "But it wouldn't be
a damn thing without a woman's touch." Now, he's producing
her albums.

<HL> 'New Age' Music Wins Wider Following
As Many People Grow Too Old for Rock

<TEXT>
   Even its fans sometimes call it "audio Valium" or "yuppie elevator music."
Yet "New Age" music -- mostly instrumental, mellow and melodic, and sometimes electronic -- is catching on.

   Often carrying such meditative titles as "Deep Breakfast" and "In Search of the Turtle's Navel," New Age pieces have moved out of cultdom and into the musical mainstream.
Until recently, most New Age records were produced by small, independent record labels that got little attention from record stores and none from commercial radio.
Now, though New Age hardly threatens to outmuscle rock, it is beginning to command a widespread following.

   The pioneer independent New Age label, Windham Hill of Palo Alto, Calif., had sales of $30 million last year.
Little labels such as Private Music and Cinema Records, both less than two years old, are being snapped up, into distribution deals, by major record companies.
Record stores across the country are adding New Age bins.
And last month the first Grammy Award for New Age music went to Andreas Vollenweider, a Swiss harpist with two gold records on the CBS label.

   Even radio has tuned in.
For at least three years there had been a few scattered New Age programs around the country, shoehorned inside rock or jazz formats.
Then, on Valentine's Day this year, one major Los Angeles radio station -- which 19 years ago helped pioneer so-called album-oriented rock -- switched full time to New Age and other music it calls "light, hypnotic, uplifting."
No longer KMET, the station now is KTWV -- "The WAVE."
Since then, "beautiful-music" station KLRS, in Santa Cruz, Calif., has gone New Age.
In early April, CBS Radio will begin nationally syndicating a weekly two-hour New Age program, "The New Era."

   "Rock is great when the hormones are raging through you, but tastes change as you grow up," says Frank Cody, the program director for KTWV in Los Angeles.
He adds: "I've never seen a response like we're getting already.
We get these elegant letters written on word processors."

   Surveys by Windham Hill show the average age of those who buy its records is around 32, and that New Age listeners tend to be urban and upscale.
Anne Robinson, who co-founded Windham Hill 11 years ago and still runs it, says the music establishment kept on making rock records, mostly for teen-agers, long after baby boomers hit their 20s and 30s.
"Now they realize there is this whole segment of population with discretionary income they haven't been supplying records for," she says.

   For years, Windham Hill and other labels couldn't get their records distributed through normal channels.
Ms. Robinson says the New Age term was applied because at first, record sales were mostly through small independent bookstores, and an early Windham Hill booster was a magazine called "New Age."

   Quality was what spread the word beyond the tofu-and-granola crowd: Many New Age fans first heard the music at stereo stores, which used the high-quality pressings to show off high-end equipment.
Audiophiles love effects like those on the Living Music label, which records in such places as the Grand Canyon and inside a reverberant stone cathedral.

   One New Age label noted especially for sound quality is American Gramaphone, in Omaha, Neb.
The eclectic musical approach of founder-producer-composer Chip Davis tells a lot about the history and attraction of the music.
Though he is a classically trained musician who once played bassoon in the Toledo (Ohio) Symphony, Mr. Davis has had an unconventional music career that included a stint as a jingle writer in Omaha.
A country-and-western-style commercial he wrote for Old Home Bread, about a bread-truck driver, was so popular that Mr. Davis started making country records.
One, "Convoy," sold seven million copies.

   That success allowed Mr. Davis to start his own label, American Gramaphone, about a decade ago, to record instrumental music he had been writing for his own pleasure.
He called his pieces "baroque rock."
They combined classical forms with a sometimes-rock beat.
They were played on historical instruments, including harpsichords built by his father, along with drums and synthesizers.

   He called his albums "Fresh Aire."
To record them he assembled studio musicians known as the "Mannheim Steamroller" group.

   Mr. Davis, a soft-spoken long-haired man of 39, is obsessed with each step of record-making.
One Fresh Aire album begins with a Gregorian chant recorded in a cathedral and continues with a Chip Davis composition performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Mr. Davis.
All his records weigh at least 120 grams, well above the average 90 to 100, so less warping occurs and the records last longer.
Record sleeves and jackets are thick, with fancy graphics.

   All this costs a lot.
The first American Gramaphone records bore suggested retail prices of $17.95. (The prices have since declined to $12.95, still considerably above most conventional vinyl records.)
Prices for the company's compact disks also sell at premiums.
Despite the high prices, little advertising and no radio play, audiophiles discovered the label.
By last year, annual sales topped $5 million.

   One fan, Eric Sjorgen, a 31-year-old New Jersey pharmacist who calls himself "an audio nut, a fanatic," says: "I first heard the Fresh Aire albums at a stereo store.
The music was different and the fidelity was great.
The tranquility of the music calmed me.
I have every record and compact disk they ever did."
On top of that, Mr. Sjorgen had the music played at his wedding.

   Mr. Davis hopes to reach an even wider audience with the album he just finished, his 23rd.
It features guitarist Mason Williams, best known for a runaway instrumental hit in 1968 called "Classical Gas," which Mr. Davis says was one of his principal inspirations.
That song, a catchy tune meshing classical guitar, harpsichord and violins with synthesizer and drums, was re-recorded for the new album, due out in the fall.
If the Mason Williams record "goes gold" by attaining sales of 500,000, as Mr. Davis hopes, it would be his label's second gold album.
Only a handful of New Age records have sold so well.

   Opinions differ as to just how vast the New Age market will become with radio and record-industry support.
"I think this is going to be a major factor for years to come," says Lee Abrams, an Atlanta media consultant who persuaded the Santa Cruz station to try New Age, on the basis of consumer research.
"This will become mood radio for the new mainstream."
But a spokeswoman for CBS Records, a division of CBS Inc., says, "There is almost a glut of New Age music.
I think there's a danger of boredom creeping in."

   One thing is sure: The critics haven't fallen in love with New Age.
"The music is bloodless, just a notch above elevator music," says Patrick Goldstein, an entertainment writer for the Los Angeles Times.
"But it's a wonderful demographic idea.
Record buyers are older.
They are looking for softer, more-soothing music."

   Great artists often lead lives of torment, and that goes double for the world's top panflute player.
Most people have never heard of him, and many who have laugh at his music.

   Such is the realm of Gheorghe Zamfir (pronounced George Zamfear).

   At first glance his life seems a virtuoso's dream come true.
He is the master of an obscure instrument and the current king of music albums sold on late-night television in the U.S.

   Without benefit of even one hit song played by radio disk jockeys to bolster sales in record stores, the 48-year-old Romanian is peddling enough albums through ads on cable TV to keep him in Rolls-Royces, $200-a-bottle wines and the Italian fashions he loves.

   "He hadn't even been heard of in the U.S. until 3 1/2 years ago.
Now he is the longest-running album seller on Cable News Network," says Charlotte Leonard, the cable channel's manager of direct-response advertising.
"CNN made Zamfir," she says.

   Tune into late-night cable and see Zamfir, his dark chest heaving, his gold chain glistening, the spotlight carefully aimed to leave his wrinkles in shadow.
Song-titles roll across vistas of seashores, sunsets over palm trees, majestic mountains, and the magic of Zamfir is revealed -- in his rendition of "Yesterday," "Somewhere My Love" and "Amazing Grace."

   But success in the New World holds many sour notes for the Romanian emigrant: recording lounge-lizard tunes he despises instead of his beloved Romanian folk songs, scorn from music critics, suspicions that he was shortchanged on concert fees and a mismanaged tour of the U.S. that drowned in red ink.
He recently sold his house in Montreal, fired his agent and tour manager and moved to France.
He is refusing press interviews.
Today, Mr. Zamfir's cosmos is far from the one described on his late-night ads: "Relax, as Zamfir sweeps you away to a world of haunting, tranquil beauty."
In reality, he spends most of his time behind a steel door framed in an expanse of steel wall in a Paris apartment.
He fears Soviet secret agents, associates say, having fled to France from Communist Romania about 12 years ago.

   What happened?

   Mr. Zamfir began his musical life playing the accordion; at age 14, he took up the panflute, also called panpipes -- a simple wind instrument in which tones are obtained by bundling up to 30 wood pipes of different sizes together and blowing into the openings.
He conducted a Romanian folk ensemble in the '60s and later gave panflute concerts, at $10,000 a performance.
In l983 he moved from Paris to Canada, where his folk songs and original compositions for the panflute are popular.
Concert fees rose to $30,000.

   The Zamfir known to Americans, however, has little to do with folk-song and originality.
About four years ago, Mr. Zamfir signed with Welk Group, a Los Angeles-based company that packages albums on the Heartland Music label, and sells them on a cable channel, often between midnight and 6 a.m., when a two-minute spot costs about $500.

   Lawrence Welk Jr., co-owner of Welk Group and son of the famous bandleader, says he considered Mr. Zamfir's sound a high risk.
"I wouldn't have been surprised if it had bombed.
But we dictated the repertoire we wanted."

   The Group used the formula that sells well in the land of the insomniacs.
"Too much original material, even if it's great, is hard on our customers.
If they love an Irish tenor doing 'Ave Maria,' they'll love Zamfir doing it," says Ira Pittelman, president of Heartland.
Thus, Mr. Zamfir's TV platter, "The Magic of Zamfir," contains "Ave Maria," and the album cover promotes Irish tenor Frank Patterson's version of it on another Heartland record.
Mr. Patterson's album also contains "Amazing Grace" and "Annie's Song."
Those tunes are also found on "Zamfir Plays the World's Most Beautiful Melodies."

   Mr. Zamfir's distributors and promoters hail him as the most successful panflutist in the world, though they can't name any others.

   But U.S. music critics aren't impressed -- by his sound or his promoters' claims.
"It's Muzak for people who are snobby about Muzak," says Tim Page, chief classical music critic at Newsday.
"Banal tootling," says Michael Fleming of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch.

   Paul Grein, a columnist for Billboard, a music-industry weekly, dismisses Mr. Zamfir as a "manufactured star," and scoffs at Heartland's claim that he has sold more than 20 million records world-wide.
"That's to make the public think, 'He's a big star I don't know about, so I'm missing out,'" Mr. Grein says.

   Curiously, Heartland Music officials can't offer details about where all those 20 million records were sold.
Turns out their source is Mr. Zamfir's non-TV record company, Polygram Records Inc.
A Polygram official says she can't document either those sales or claims that more than 60 of his records have sold enough to be "Gold" and "Platinum."

   Still, Mr. Zamfir has his admirers: Heartland and cable officials agree that TV sales of Zamfir albums have reached 750,000, enough to make him a millionaire.

   He is known as a handsome "ladies' man," fond of giving flowers, according to Nancy Zannini, vice president of a division of Polygram Records Inc., the New York company that sells his non-TV albums.
"He makes women feel beautiful.
He's very continental.
Of course Romanian is just a hop, skip and a jump from Italian," she adds.

   He is also betrothed, according to Susan Nichols, the mother of his three-year-old son.
Ms. Nichols, who works at the U.S. Consulate in Montreal, says she will wed Mr. Zamfir in December.
"George is looking for a castle outside Paris," where the three will live, she says.

   But Mr. Zamfir should be in the U.S. right now, capitalizing on his TV-sales success, associates say.
He is missing out on millions of potential dollars in concert appearances and album sales by being in Europe, estimates Polygram's Ms. Zannini.

   "The public is the guilty party.
They make him play 'The Shadow of Your Smile' and 'Just the Way You Are.' That's what they want, but he's a serious musician," says Ms. Zannini.
Polygram has recorded Zamfir's own pieces, though Ms. Zannini admits they don't sell well and she's about to lean on him to record an album of her favorite Spanish tangos.

   His failed 1985 tour of a dozen or so U.S. cities was doomed when a manager absconded with expense money and plane tickets, according to Ms. Nichols.
"George went on with the musicians but the whole thing was so poorly managed it cost him more than a million dollars," she says.

   Though he now lives in Paris, some good memories of the New World remain, in keepsakes and notes sent by his many fans -- a gold-leaf Bible, an ostrich egg-shaped music box and sketches and paintings admirers have drawn of their beloved Zamfir.
Perhaps reflecting the lives of the thousands who have been moved to buy "The Magic of Zamfir," a housewife from Osage Beach, Mo., wrote him this note: Your music takes "all the stress, anger or nervousness right out of me.
I have a stressful job, a sick husband and a dog that bites me."

   2 Live Crew took X-rated pokes at local
law officials, but performed without incident just hours after a
record store owner was arrested for selling the rap group's ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   ``This city has a lot greater problems to deal with than who is
performing at Club Nu,'' City Commissioner Bruce Singer said before
Friday night's show.
   The Miami rappers played for 45 minutes to a packed house at
Club Nu, which holds about 1,500. They took profanity-laced verbal
jabs at Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro and Gov. Bob Martinez,
who have attacked the group's sexually explicit lyrics.
   On Saturday, about 150 anti-censorship activists staged a brief
protest at the Coral Gables home of Jack Thompson, an attorney who
has campaigned to get 2 Live Crew's records removed from area music
stores.
   The protestors left after about 15 minutes when police
responding to neighbors' complaints told the group they lacked a
permit for the demonstration, said police Sgt. Dennis Koronkiewicz.
Coral Gables is a suburb of Miami.
   About 15 police officers and a small crowd of several hundred
people were on hand as the rappers performed an early, clean show
for patrons of all ages Saturday night at Hollywood's Club Futura.
Band members expected a larger audience and a livelier show during
an adults-only set later Saturday at the club.
   ``We're gonna do 2 Live, nasty as they wanna be,'' band leader
Luther Campbell vowed, speaking of the second show.
   A spokesman for Hollywood police said that would be fine _ at
least in the short run.
   ``We are not going to jump up and stop the show and run the risk
of having some kind of wild riot and have to take a lot of people
to jail,'' Ed Cunningham said Saturday. ``If something happens that
appears it does violate the judge's order, we'll document it and
we're going to forward it to the judge or the state attorney's
office for Broward County.''
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday that the
million-selling album, released more than a year ago, is obscene by
community standards in Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties.
   That cleared the way for Friday's arrest of Charles Freeman,
owner of E-C Records, who sold copies of the recording to an
undercover deputy. He faces a first-degree misdemeanor charge and
is free on $100 bond.
   If convicted, he could be jailed for a year and fined $1,000.
   Both Freeman and Campbell said they had gotten supportive phone
calls Friday from rock star Frank Zappa, a vocal opponent of
censorship.
   Campbell also pledged his financial, legal and moral support to
retailers who have problems after selling the record. He is owner
and president of 2 Live Crew's record label, now called Luke's
because of copyright problems with the former name Luke Skyywalker.
   The obscenity ruling brought new interest in the group, a
promoter said.
   ``Until this trial, we never could have booked this group on
such short notice, with no time (to advertise) and still expect a
full house,'' said Club Nu promoter Bob Slade. ``They're more
popular than ever now.''
   Campbell was enjoying all the free publicity.
   ``I can't pay for this advertising,'' he said at a Friday news
conference held in the two-story building he recently purchased to
house his recording empire.
   ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' a double album, has sold more
than 1.7 million copies.
   ``The machines are running right now,'' Campbell he said,
smiling.

LOS LOBOS RETURNS TO OLD HAUNTS ON NEW LP
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic;
his pieces regularly appear in the Calendar section.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One reason Los Lobos took so long to record its new album, "The Neighborhood,"
was, ironically, the huge success of the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet's "La
Bamba" single.
</P>
<P>
The group's last album of original songs -- 1987's "By the Light of the Moon"
-- was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the
American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective.
</P>
<P>
Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los
Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection
sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of
numerous critics.
</P>
<P>
Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway
success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: several songs
for the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Mexican-American
rock star Ritchie Valens. The soundtrack album sold more than 2 million copies,
and Los Lobos' title track spent weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to
return with another collection of oldies. But that would have meant setting
aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will the Wolf
Survive?" recordings so memorable.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican
folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring
venture, but negligible when compared to "La Bamba."
</P>
<P>
Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that
Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album.
</P>
<P>
"The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was
overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los
Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house
in the Belvedere district of East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows," Hidalgo
said, "but we would wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was
it to see us or just because of the movie?"
</P>
<P>
The "Pistola" project, he said, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music
that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East L.A.
</P>
<P>
"The Neighborhood," which will figure prominently in the group's Oct. 19
concert at the Greek Theatre, features a few bluesy, high-spirited workouts
that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album radiates with the
disarming artistic vision exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon."
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos -- which also consists of singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas, bassist
Conrad Lozano and saxophonist Steve Berlin -- began work on the new album in
late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But writing it
took longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II,' " Perez said.
"That would have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course
of writing the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . .
the thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with
'La Bamba.'
</P>
<P>
"I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and
as introspective as 'Moon' . . . that maybe we should do something more
accessible," he said. "But every time we started going too far in that
direction, we found ourselves stopping and clearing the table . . . starting
all over, getting back to something that really meant something to us."
</P>
<P>
The four original members of Los Lobos (Berlin joined the group in the '80s)
were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate rock bands until
getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only being able to play
Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four friends began
exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours.
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that
they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and
1980. Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and
imagination that was being generated by bands on the Hollywood club circuit,
and the group shifted to rock.
</P>
<P>
Gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and Los Lobos
stepped up to an entirely new creative level.
</P>
<P>
Images of the band members' old neighborhood surface in some of the songs on
the new album.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the
title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album, and it seemed to
tie things together.
</P>
<P>
"It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything . . . about the way
each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city.
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from the usual news routines of gang violence and drive-bys
and everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And
that's what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of
that hope."
</P>
<P>
Perez dug deeper into the band's philosophy and past.
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock
hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question
had a lot to do with where we came from . . . this neighborhood."

   Sheriff's deputies burst into a
record shop Friday moments after an undercover detective bought 2
Live Crew recordings to make the first arrest since a federal judge
declared the rap group's album obscene.
   E-C Records owner Charles Freeman had defiantly ordered a
shipment of 25 copies of ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' and was doing
a brisk business when an undercover officer bought the double-album
and a cassette for $8.49 each.
   Before the detective reached the door, six deputies rushed in,
handcuffing Freeman and arresting him on misdemeanor charges of
distributing obscene material. If convicted, he could be sentenced
to a year in jail and fined $1,000.
   ``America is free, free for everybody,'' Freeman said before
authorities took him to the Broward County Jail, where he was booked
and posted $100 bond. ``And as long as this is America and I'm not
living in Cuba, I feel my rights are violated.''
   The arrest came two days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez
found that the sexually explicit recording was without social value,
appealed only to prurient interests and violated community standards
in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
   Lyrics of many of the songs on the album contain references to
violence against women and abusive sex, though they're tempered with
humor.
   ``The inevitable has finally occurred,'' said Robyn E. Blumner,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida.
``Someone in Broward is facing jail time because he sold a record
album to an adult. That action put south Florida about on a par with
Eastern Europe _ a year ago.''
   She said the ACLU will offer legal representation to Freeman.
   At a news conference later in Miami, Luther Campbell, owner and
president of 2 Live Crew's record label, said the company will help
pay the legal fees of retailers arrested for selling the album.
   ``Somebody has to stand up and the retailers, I think, should
stand up,'' Campbell said. ``We can give them some of the contacts
we used in our case and we can help them financially.'' Campbell did
not give specifics.
   The Miami-based rap group sued after Sheriff Nick Navarro sent
his deputies in March to warn retailers they faced arrest for
selling the album. The sheriff acted after a county judge said the
material was ``probably obscene.''
   Gonzalez said the sheriff's office engaged in prior restraint of
free speech by threatening owners before the recording was ruled
obscene.
   The judge listened to 2 Live Crew's recording, which offers a
frank, detailed discussion of sexual positions and practices. He
also heard witnesses and legal anti-censorship arguments May 14-15
before issuing his opinion.
   Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences, issued a statement in Los Angeles denouncing the
court's ruling as politically motivated.
   ``It pungently underlines the oppressive right-wing political
agenda that is attempting to legislate morality in all the arts,
including music. It's another attempt to smother freedom in this
country, freedom for the recording artist.''
   In the three hours before his arrest, Freeman said, he sold all
but six copies of the recording. He said a line had formed outside
the shop in anticipation of the shipment's arrival.
   ``I'll go to jail, and I'll come back and sell it again,'' he
said. ``I opened up a record store three years ago expecting to sell
records and this was the furthest thing from my mind.''
   Authorities confiscated the remaining recordings.
   Friends and customers packed into E-C Records to complain after
he was taken to jail for booking on the misdemeanor charge.
   Assistant manager Edward G. Robinson said Freeman felt strongly
about the issue.
   ``If we can buy them, Mr. Freeman will sell them,'' Robinson
said, adding that he won't. ``Personally, I don't care for the
inside of a jail cell.''
   ``Why they'd pick this one guy?'' asked Gary White, 27, in the
shop with his 19-month-old son. ``Once they take the rights away
from one guy, it's going to spread. It's not right when a person
can't express himself.''
   The judge's obscenity ruling has no legal effect outside south
Florida, but civil libertarians see a practical effect spreading
nationally.
   Supplies of the disputed record dried up in the Miami area as the
obscenity case was argued, but the decision was expected to boost
sales elsewhere.
   The decision had no effect on the group's plans for shows Friday
night at Club Nu in Miami Beach and Saturday night at Club Futura in
nearby Hollywood.
   The group planned to perform its sexually explicit material both
nights at a late show for adults, after an early, cleaned-up show
for all ages, Campbell said.

ROBERT HILBURN: 'RAINBOW WARRIORS' SMASHES SALES RECORDS IN THE SOVIET UNION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Rainbow Warriors" was one of the biggest-selling albums of the year even
before it hit the U.S. record shops this week.
</P>
<P>
That's because the collection -- a two-record compilation featuring previously
released tracks by more than two dozen of today's most prized rock acts -- has
sold 4 million copies in the Soviet Union since it was released there on March
6.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the phenomenal Soviet sales: "Rainbow Warriors" is a
breakthrough in a country that has been notoriously slow to accept contemporary
rock.
</P>
<P>
While the collection is still not a total survey of what's happening today in
rock (there's no heavy metal, rap or post-punk), the album does represent the
first time Soviet record stores have carried an album that showcases what might
best be described as "up-to-date rock."
</P>
<P>
Until now, rock albums -- which have to be released in any quantity through
Melodiya, the government record label -- have either been decade-old
collections by the likes of the Beatles or Moody Blues or the special Paul
McCartney package of '50s rockers.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the vinyl and cassette versions of "Rainbow Warriors" offers 27
selections, including such socially conscious works as U2's "Pride (In the Name
of Love)," Peter Gabriel's "Red Rain," Sting's "Love Is the Seventh Wave,"
R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World As We Know It," Lou Reed's "Last Great
American Whale" and Bruce Hornsby's "Look Out Any Window." In addition, the CD
version contains four additional tracks, including Hothouse Flowers' "Hard
Rain" and Robbie Robertson's "Somewhere Down the Crazy River."
</P>
<P>
That sales explosion -- another million copies are expected to be sold in the
Soviet Union by Christmas -- is exactly the excitement envisioned by the
album's sponsor, Greenpeace, the international environmental advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
"We always had a lot of rock artists giving donations, but we hadn't actually
approached them for support before," Cornelia Durrant, chairman of Greenpeace
in England and one of the key figures behind the album, said during a recent
interview in London.
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace is very keyed to creating our own publicity, so we haven't needed
to use celebrities in the past, but we felt we needed their help this time.
These rock artists are literally worshipped by young people in Russia and we
saw them as our ticket into the country. It was a way to raise funds for the
Greenpeace chapter there and draw attention to our goals."
</P>
<P>
Besides contributing tracks to the album, various bands -- most notably R.E.M.
on its recent arena tour -- have been allowing Greenpeace volunteers to
distribute informational material at their concerts.
</P>
<P>
This involvement, in effect, has made Greenpeace the rock community's new
charity of choice, assuming the position held in recent years by Amnesty
International. The latter involvement was climaxed by an unprecedented
five-continent tour featuring Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel and Sting.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Durrant said, the rash of rock benefits -- from Live Aid through
the Amnesty tour -- had made Greenpeace wary of turning to the musicians for
support.
</P>
<P>
"The more people use a particular device or method for promoting issues, the
less effective it becomes over time. People get a bit bored with it. It's like,
'Oh, here come the rock stars again . . . ' and they tune out," she said.
</P>
<P>
But Ian Flooks, one of England's leading rock agents and the album's executive
producer, said the rock connection was perfect for what the organization wanted
to do in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to find a way of raising money for Greenpeace outside of any
government influence . . . as many individual donations from as large a number
of people as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace had looked into doing a record a few years ago, but it did not seem
possible. But this time, we found nothing but cooperation on the part of the
Russians. Once we had it approved, we realized there was no reason why we
shouldn't use it in as many countries as possible . . . raising more funds and
raising awareness on a worldwide level. My objective is to make this the first
record ever released in every country in the world."
</P>
<P>
Sales in most countries aren't expected to match the hot pace of the Soviet
Union figures, but they should be strong -- given the line-up that also
includes such names as Sting, the Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Simple Minds
and John Cougar Mellencamp. The album was released in the United States by
Geffen Records, and sales are expected to reach the 1 million level.
</P>
<P>
DRIVIN' N' CRYIN'/LINGERIE -- There's a song ("Honeysuckle Blue") on the new
album by the rock group Drivin' N' Cryin' that is so wonderfully evocative that
it alone was enough reason to check out the Atlanta quartet's appearance
Thursday night at the Lingerie, where it opened for the recently reviewed House
of Freaks. The song is a bittersweet tale of sad regret about lost ideals and
endangered environment that has the fresh breath of a strong, original pop
vision.
</P>
<P>
But Drivin' N' Cryin' showed little of that distinctive style in the opening
two-thirds of its hour set at the club, serving up instead some undernourished
Led Zeppelin power-rock and some overstated Tom Petty roots-rock.
</P>
<P>
The colorlessness of the music was underscored when the band, led by
singer-songwriter Kevn Kinney, finally got around to "Honeysuckle Blue" and
followed it with an equally rewarding "Straight to Hell." The latter is a
country-accented story -- reminiscent of the Flying Burrito Brothers in its
sense of naked emotion -- about a young boy being cast aside by his family and
his town.
</P>
<P>
There is such a gap between these songs and the rest of the band's set that the
band ought to sit down and listen to a tape of the show and see which direction
it wants to follow: the mostly colorless hard rock or the more engaging and
original tone of "Honeysuckle Blue" and "Straight to Hell." If the vote ends up
a tie, count this as an offer to cast the deciding vote.
</P>

   Warner Records is betting on Zvuki Mu, even though
its flashy lead singer, Peter Mamonov, insists on singing in
Russian. Columbia is going with Boris Grebenshikov, a rock 'n' roll
switch-hitter who can belt 'em out in both Russian and English.
   It's all part of a rush by major entertainment companies to
bring out albums by Soviet rock musicians.
   The companies hope the curiosity of Americans about contemporary
Russia will sell records. They say the Gorbachev era has made
Soviet culture a hot product.
   But record executives have widely varying views of how authentic
a sound the public will pay to hear. Some are deliberately
Westernizing the music, prompting critics to say Americans are
missing the real soundtrack of glasnost.
   At one end of the spectrum is Grebenshikov's solo album ``Radio
Silence,'' which Columbia Records plans to release in June. Ten of
the 12 songs are in English and were written especially for the
album. All were recorded in the West by a successful British
producer, David Stewart of the rock group the Eurythmics.
   It has poetic, dreamy lyrics that are not overtly political or
even distinctively Russian in content. Aside from the raspy voice
of the chain-smoking, pony-tailed Grebenshikov, ``Radio Silence''
bears little resemblance to his wildly popular Leningrad band
Akvarium (Aquarium), which has sold 3.5 million official albums and
countless underground tapes in the Soviet Union.
   Jack Rovner, Columbia vice president for marketing, said
Grebenshikov himself decided to do the album in English because,
otherwise, the music's appeal ``obviously would have limitations.''
   Some record companies, however, are taking the plunge into
Russian lyrics.
   In late April, Opal-Warner Bros. released an album entirely in
Russian by Zvuki Mu, a Moscow band whose name means ``Sounds of
Mu'' _ a tongue-in-cheek tribute both to ``The Sound of Music'' and
to the mooing of cows.
   Like Columbia, Opal-Warner used a big-name Western producer,
Brian Eno. But the recording was made in a Moscow studio and
preserved Zvuki Mu's homegrown flavor, a blend of intellectual rock
and funk. The initial 50,000 records, cassettes and compact disks
have just reached the stores.
   Zvuki Mu is scheduled to bring its rambunctious stage act to New
York's Lincoln Center in July. Grebenshikov also is planning a U.S.
tour, probably in the fall.
   Of all the new releases, perhaps the most authentic is ``Gruppa
Krovi'' (Blood Type), a collection of Russian protest songs and
dance numbers by singer-poet Viktor Tsoi and his punk group Kino
(Cinema). The album was recorded in the apartment of one of the
band members.
   Joanna Stingray, an American singer married to Kino guitarist
Yuri Kasparyan, said she recently sat in a plush Leningrad
restaurant with a group of Soviet rock performers reminiscing
``about the old days when they literally went hungry.''
   Today, she said, top Soviet stars travel back and forth to the
West and earn tens of thousands of dollars from record contracts,
as well as commanding thousands of rubles per concert in the Soviet
Union.
   ``It used to be they couldn't afford a taxi ride home at
night,'' Stingray said. ``Now they are getting rich, at least by
Soviet standards.''
   Kino's four-track recording was released in April by Gold Castle
Records, a small Los Angeles label, but has the muscle of Capitol
Records' distribution network behind it.
   ``We wanted to make sure it was the real Russian stuff,'' said
Gold Castle promotion director Jeff Heiman. ``That seemed like the
hippest thing to do.''
   It is also the smallest release, at 10,000 copies, an example of
the trade-off between artistic integrity and commercial success
that worries Stingray and others on both sides of the rapidly
parting Iron Curtain.
   Artemy Troitsky, a Moscow rock impresario, has warned that the
newfound respectability of Soviet groups is fraught with peril, not
only because the government could crack down at any time, but also
because bands may be tempted to sell out.
   ``We've waited a long time for this, and it's a great day,''
Troitsky wrote in ``Back in the USSR,'' a history of Soviet rock
published last fall. ``But previously, musicians exercised their
creativity under the slogan `We've Got Nothing To Lose,' and thus
didn't think much about altering their work to ... win official
prestige.
   ``Now, whether they recognize it consciously or not, the new
conditions push them toward compromise.''

   Reba McEntire is the only singer ever
voted female vocalist of the year four times by the Country Music
Association.
   She has performed live for millions She has a platinum album
(more than a million copies sold) for her ``Greatest Hits.'' She's
won a Grammy, appeared on three Bob Hope TV specials and branched
out into acting.
   What's left?
   ``Everything,'' she said. ``We want to sell more tickets and
more albums. Do movies and television. Produce records. Have a
bigger publishing company. Have more acts for my company.
   ``We've got lots to do.''
   McEntire, 35, who took off five months to have her first baby in
February, has had six straight gold albums, and was voted best
female country vocalist from 1984-87.
   She's in the midst of a 115-city concert tour that began May 3.
Her 17th album, ``Rumor Has It,'' has just been released.
   She recently acted in her first movie, ``Tremors,'' appearing as
a survivalist with star Kevin Bacon.
   ``I like to act and I want to pursue it more,'' she said in an
interview in her office a few days after singing at the Goodwill
Games in Seattle. ``Of course music and touring is No. 1.''
   Her single, ``Walk On,'' reached No. 2 on the country music
charts in July. It was about persevering during hard times, and
joined other topical issues she previously has tackled: ``The
Stairs'' was about wife abuse, and ``Am I the Only One Who Cares''
dealt with teen-age suicide and alienation.
   ``Fancy,'' in her new album, is about a mother pushing a girl
into prostitution to get ahead in life.
   ``I chose it because I liked it,'' McEntire said. ``I've wanted
to record it for five years.''
   Her 1987 Grammy was for ``Whoever's in New England.'' Her other
hit records include ``Cathy's Clown,'' ``New Fool at an Old Game,''
``Little Rock,'' ``Love Will Find Its Way to You,'' ``One Promise
Too Late'' and ``What Am I Gonna Do About You.''
   McEntire recently was co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
filling in for Joan Lunden who was on vacation. She appeared on the
Hope specials on NBC during the past few years.
   ``He liked me, and he likes to work with people he gets along
with and are easy to work with,'' McEntire said. ``We were told to
be there at a certain time, and we were there, usually early.''
   McEntire was the third of four children who grew up in Chockie,
Okla., where she mixed ranching, rodeoing and singing. She is a
former rodeo barrel racer and spent several years on a ranch in
Stringtown, Okla.
   She first appeared on country music charts in 1976, one year
after she gained notice by singing the National Anthem at the
National Rodeo Finals in Oklahoma City.
   But McEntire wasn't always on top. ``I've been booed off stage.
At times I haven't drawn flies. I've sat in a store to sign
autographs and someone asked me where the bathroom is!''
   Nevertheless, her string of four straight honors as country
music's top female singer likely will never be matched. Looking
back on it today, she's actually relieved K.T. Oslin finally
displaced her as the winner.
   ``It would have been sudden death for me if I had won it
again,'' McEntire said. ``You don't want to ride a good horse to
death.''
   She dismissed a story in a supermarket tabloid that she and
Oslin, best known for her hit record ``80s Ladies,'' are feuding.
   ``It was good that K.T. won. She is spunky and she brought
something to country music that we all needed, something totally
different. I really appreciate K.T.''
   Having a child has made her career even more meaningful to her.
   ``I have something to work for now that I have Shelby: to
accumulate more, allow him to be secure if something happens to
me.''

<LEADPARA>  RADIO stations won't play it. A record store chain banned it. The British

made it the nation's favorite album, buying 954,000 copies in its first weeks
of release.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Recordings  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     N.W.A. stands for Niggers With Attitude, and it's that angry, rebellious
attitude that sells. "It's absolutely the music that nobody's parents can
understand," said Jerry Heller, N.W.A.'s manager.;    "Niggaz4Life" boils over
with urban rage, the songs so peppered with profanity and images of sexual
violence they eventually numb the ears.;    It's an unsettling combination of
social commentary and foul mouths. N.W.A. has wide appeal, with whites buying
the album far more frequently than blacks, Heller said.;    Women are freely
described as "bitches" and "whores." Male sexual gratification -- and sexual
assault of females -- anchor more than half the album's songs. Police are
scum.;    Blacks are called "niggers" without pause, the word rattled off
scores of times before the album's last song winds down. About the only words
that can be quoted from one song are its title: "To Kill a Hooker.";    The
110-store WaxWorks chain banned the album from its outlets in 37 states. About
5,000 copies of "Niggaz4Life" were seized by Scotland Yard authorities from a
warehouse outside London in early June because the album allegedly violated
the Obscene Publications Act.;    Unlike the raunchy-for-no-reason party raps
of the 2 Live Crew, N.W.A.'s musical brutality can be traced to the real-life
urban catastrophe from which the band members sprang.;    Eazy-E, who leads
N.W.A. with a distinctive high-pitched voice, is a former drug dealer. The
band's M.C. Ren complains that he's hassled by police wherever he goes, and
he's fled gang-plagued Compton, a Los Angeles suburb, for safer environs.
Other band members include D.J. Yella and Dr. Dre.;    "It don't make no sense
to stay in the area when you know you can get shot at every day, get robbed
and killed," Ren said. "If you have the money to move, you should move.";
In their first album, the equally raunchy "Straight Outta Compton," N.W.A.
painted their ghetto home in colorful images that made drive-by-shootings,
drugs and police harassment part of a vivid, violent tableau. It sold 2
million copies.;    In 1989, Matt Ahlerich, the FBI's assistant director for
public affairs, said in a letter to N.W.A.'s record label that "advocating
violence and assault is wrong, and we in the law enforcement community take
exception to such action.";    N.W.A. couldn't have asked for a better
endorsement.;    With their most recent release, they examine the group's own
fame, sing about sex and drugs and blast the police again. Said Heller: "Until
our society solves the inner-city problems, they won't be hurting for
material.";    N.W.A.'s music blasts past the smooth rhythm and blues textures
behind the softer sounds of rappers such as M.C. Hammer. Although their latest
album is well-produced, mixing traditional street raps sounds with calypso and
audio effects, it's still raw.;    "There's so much bull out like old groups
trying to make comebacks and rappers doing R &amp; B. Every rap group that's
coming out now is pop," said N.W.A.'s M.C. Ren.;    Why is N.W.A. popular?
"People identify with their own street life," said M.C. Ren. "There are a lot
of different situations that they can relate to because they went through that
same (stuff) growing up."  </TEXT>

VERDICT IS GUILTY IN 2 LIVE CREW'S RAP ALBUM SALE

<P>
An all-white jury Wednesday convicted a Ft. Lauderdale record store owner of
obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the rap group 2 Live Crew.
</P>
<P>
The guilty verdict is believed to be the first conviction in the United States
of selling an obscene musical work.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely stunned," said Bruce Rogow, attorney for the store owner,
Charles Freeman. "This is going to have a chilling effect on the industry, and
sends a message to all music stores that they are at risk unless they're
selling Mantovani."
</P>
<P>
Record industry executives also expressed shock and vowed to help Freeman
appeal. "The target (of the prosecution) is a black form of music and the real
victim is freedom of expression," said Michael Greene, president of the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
But Jack Thompson, the Coral Gables, Fla., anti-obscenity crusader who
initiated the national campaign against 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna
Be" album last January, called the verdict "a victory for women and children."
</P>
<P>
"This verdict sends a clear message to the record industry that they better
stop distributing obscene records that degrade women," Thompson said in a
telephone interview. "If they don't, it will be a short trip up the
distribution food chain to the boardrooms of the major record labels."
</P>
<P>
Freeman was arrested by an undercover police officer June 8, two days after a
U.S. District Court judge ruled that the album violated community obscenity
standards, thereby banning its sale in three South Florida counties.
</P>
<P>
Freeman was tried on the misdemeanor charge before a county judge in Ft.
Lauderdale. He faces a possible one-year jail sentence and a $1,000 fine.
Sentencing was set for Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the rap group have also been charged with performing obscene
material at a June 11 nightclub show in nearby Hollywood. Their trial is set
for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The album, filled with graphic references to sex acts, has brought renown and
fortune to the Miami-based rap group. The album, which has sold over 2 million
copies, has also touched off a national debate over issues of artistic freedom,
community standards and race.
</P>
<P>
Luther Campbell, leader of 2 Live Crew, has long contended that he and his
music have been singled out for prosecution by white judges and law enforcement
officers who don't understand it.
</P>
<P>
Additional obscenity prosecutions of record store owners who sold the album,
including the 140-store Sound Warehouse chain -- the first corporate
prosecution -- are scheduled to begin in Texas in coming months.
</P>
<P>
In February, a record store owner in Alexander City, Ala., was acquitted of
obscenity for selling the album.
</P>
<P>
The Ft. Lauderdale jury returned its verdict after 2 1/2 hours of deliberation.
Forty-five minutes later, Freeman was back behind the counter of his store, E-C
Records, in northwest Ft. Lauderdale, and he was angry.
</P>
<P>
"That was not a jury of my peers," said Freeman, 31, who is black. "They don't
even know where my store is. (The record) is vulgar, it's nasty, but it's not
obscene. If you think this music induces you to have sex or something, you got
to be joking."
</P>
<P>
Freeman's trial opened Monday with prosector Leslie Robson saying: "I urge you
to listen to the evidence." For the next 90 minutes, the six jurors and one
alternate sat in stony-faced silence as the bass-heavy rap songs pulsed through
the packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
To convict Freeman, jurors had to find that the album is obscene, meaning it
offended community standards, appealed to a morbid interest in sex, and lacked
artistic merit and value.
</P>
<P>
In defense of his client, Rogow, a professor of law at Nova University and a
specialist in first amendment issues, told the jurors, "One person's vulgarity
is another person's art." He argued that rap music reflected and parodied black
street language, and clearly had artistic merit.
</P>
<P>
The defense was rebuffed in its efforts to introduce into evidence other rap
records, including works by the Geto Boys and Ice Cube, sexually explicit
magazines and a XXX-rated video that Rogow said would give jurors an idea of
what real pornography is like.
</P>
<P>
But the defense was able to put on the stand two music critics and a
psychologist to testify that 2 Live Crew's music was art and not injurious to
community standards.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard people tell me that they may put music on to create a mood -- a
little Johnny Mathis and a little wine," said psychologist Merry S. Haber. "But
I have never heard anybody say they were turned on by rap music."
</P>
<P>
Rogow said an appeal of the verdict was likely on several grounds, including
the judge's instructions to the jury, the inability to present certain
evidence, and the fact that only one of the 35 persons in the jury pool was
black.
</P>
<P>
"This is music from the streets, made by black people," said Rogow. "But to
this jury of six white people, it came from a foreign country. They were so
overwhelmed by the words, they couldn't hear anything else. We really have a
clash of cultures here in terms of age, sex and race."
</P>
<P>
None of the six jurors who convicted Freeman would comment afterward. But
alternate Sheryl Salomon said: "I was very offended by (the record), especially
by the lyrics. But I have to question whether or not there is artistic value.
It's music, it's still music."
</P>
<P>
Clary reported from Miami and Philips from Los Angeles.

Photo, Selling Obscenity: A Florida jury convicted a record store owner --
Charles Freeman, right -- of obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by
2 Live Crew, the rap group. It is apparently the first conviction in the U.S.
of selling an obscene musical work. Shocked record industry executives vowed to

the real victim is freedom of expression." But the anti-obscenity crusader who
initiated the campaign against 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" hailed
the verdict. Agence France-Presse

<TEXT>
   Two members of the rap group 2 Live Crew
were arrested on obscenity charges early Sunday after leaving an
adults-only concert at a local nightclub.
   The charges come four days after the Miami group's album ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be'' was declared obscene by a federal judge
and two days after an area record dealer was arrested for selling
the album.
   Bandleader Luther Campbell and band member Chris Wongwon were
taken into custody by Broward County sheriff's officers on a
misdemeanor charge of violating local obscenity laws by performing
parts of the album declared obscene, said Al Gordon, a Broward
sheriff's spokesman.
   He said arrest warrants would be issued Monday for the other two
members of the group.
   Gordon said the arrests were made several blocks from the
nightclub to avoid any problems with their fans. When the arrest
was made at 3:05 a.m., Campbell and Wongwon ``were cooperative and
went through the process without incident,'' Gordon said.
   ``When you go on television and announce that you're going to do
what you please, that's fine,'' Gordon said. ``But if you do it in
Broward County and it is in violation of Florida state statutes,
you aregoing to be arrested for it.''
   The performers were taken to the Broward County Jail in Fort
Lauderdale for booking, then were released without bond after
signing promises to appear in court on a date to be set later,
Gordon said.
   About 15 police officers and a crowd of about 300 people were on
hand Saturday night as the rappers performed an early, clean show
for patrons of all ages at Hollywood's Club Futura. About 400
people showed up for a livelier, adults-only set later Saturday
night at the club.
   At the first show, many of the young concert-goers shouted
explicit versions of the songs, even when the rap group left out
profanity.
   No incidents were reported at either show.
   The Miami-based group has sold more than 1{ million copies of
``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday that the
album, released more than a year ago, is obscene by community
standards in Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties.
   That cleared the way for Sunday's arrests, as well asa Friday's
arrest of Charles Freeman, owner of E-C Records, who sold the
record to an undercover deputy. He faces a first-degree misdemeanor
charge and is free on $100 bond.

A NEW STAGE FOR MICHAEL JACKSON
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Michael Jackson has come to the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
When the 30-year-old superstar leaves the stage after his performance tonight
at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, he'll not only end a marathon, 16-month "Bad"
world tour but also bid farewell to touring -- so he says.
</P>
<P>
Having set records for the largest grossing tour in history ($125 million) and
the largest paid attendance (4.4 million), Jackson plans to focus on recordings
and films.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying he's not going to perform live again, but I don't think we'll
ever go out on tour like this," Jackson's manager, Frank Dileo, said during an
interview in Beverly Hills this week.
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Dileo now intend to take a couple of months off to rest and make
plans.
</P>
<P>
They tentatively plan to release a double album of Jackson's greatest hits,
complete with three new songs, this fall. Jackson's next studio album isn't
expected before 1991.
</P>
<P>
"He may do a show here or there, but I don't see him ever going out on the road
again with 12 semis and 137 people. It's a very hard tour. It's 2 hours and 8
minutes and he's working constantly. It's exhausting."
</P>
<P>
Why is Jackson, one of the most celebrated stage performers of the modern pop
era, retiring from concerts?
</P>
<P>
"He's accomplished everything he has to accomplish as far as touring," said
Dileo. "He's got the biggest gross and has played to the the most people. What
are we going to do next time? Play for two years? That would kill me."
</P>
<P>
Another factor: Jackson is known to prefer film and recordings because
performances in those media -- unlike concerts -- are preserved for posterity.
</P>
<P>
The interview-shy Jackson has said for years that he wants to break into films,
but Dileo said it's more of a priority now than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"Before, he was concentrating on doing a solo career and eventually a solo
tour," Dileo said. "He's accomplished that now, so it's time to pursue this in
earnest."
</P>
<P>
The two hope to develop a film musical for Jackson to star in. Jackson's only
theatrical role to date was in the 1978 film version of "The Wiz."
</P>
<P>
"We have stacks and stacks of scripts and proposals," said Dileo. "We'll sort
through them and see what's right for Michael."
</P>
<P>
Finding the right property for a specialized talent like Jackson has proved to
be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
Even multimedia producer David Geffen was unable to find the right project when
he was retained by the singer around the time of the Jacksons' 1984 "Victory"
tour.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't come up with anything," Geffen acknowledged in a separate interview
Thursday. "It's my failure, not his. I just wasn't interested in doing a bad
movie.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will take a special project. You can't cast him in just anything. I
don't think you'd cast him as a dramatic actor, or that you could have
believably cast him in 'Coming to America.' It would have to be something
created for him."
</P>
<P>
But Geffen added: "I don't think they could cast Fred Astaire in just any
picture either. I think they had to develop special pictures for him too."
</P>
<P>
Geffen suggested that the main challenge in translating Jackson's super-stardom
to the big screen is Jackson's man-child persona, not the fact that he is
black. "It has nothing to do with black/white issues in his case," Geffen said.
"People don't relate to him in terms of color. He's just a unique human being:
He's not like any other 30-year-old you know."
</P>
<P>
"Don't bet against him," Geffen cautioned. "He's very single-minded and he's a
very hard worker. He'll get it done."
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, is among the top producers
who is reportedly trying to develop a film project for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dileo said he and Jackson are prepared to wait until a suitable film
comes along.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of artists who have chosen to do scripts that they shouldn't
have done," Dileo said. "It's like a good poker game. You can afford to wait it
out 'til it's right."
</P>
<P>
Relaxing over a pot of coffee in a hotel suite, the soft-spoken Dileo said that
the "Bad" tour, which encompassed 123 shows in 15 countries, is still something
of a blur to him.
</P>
<P>
"We know we've set a lot of records and that we've been to a lot of great
places, but we've been on such a fast track that we haven't been able to sit
down and reflect back on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tour may well be the most expensive ever mounted, in large part because of
Jackson's insistence on playing only three shows a week and resting the other
four days. Dileo kept all the musicians and crew members on salary for the
entire week, resulting in a weekly "nut" of between $500,000 and $650,000.
</P>
<P>
The tour drew especially well in Japan, England and Germany, but early ticket
sales were slow in Australia, where radio stations and fans were said to be put
off Jackson by media reports of his "eccentricities."
</P>
<P>
Dileo responded by flying top Australian DJs to Japan, where they could see
Jackson's show first-hand.
</P>
<P>
"Why not?," said Dileo. "I told them, 'I think we're getting a bum rap. Come
over and see for yourself.' They met Michael afterwards and then went back to
Australia and everything was fine. That turned the tide."
</P>
<P>
The "Bad" album has sold more than 6 million copies in this country, and is the
only album in pop history to generate five No. 1 singles.
</P>
<P>
And the project isn't over yet: Dileo said that he may well authorize the
release of an eighth single from the album, "Leave Me Alone," next week.
</P>
<P>
The album has reportedly sold 20 million copies worldwide, about half as many
as Jackson's previous album, "Thriller," and about one-fifth as many as
Jackson's reported goal for the album.
</P>
<P>
"We're happy with the results of 'Bad,' " Dileo said. "And next time out we'll
try to do as good or even better.
</P>
<P>
"Americans like to build 'em up and tear 'em down. They're like that not only
with artists, but with Presidents too. I'm sure that affected us. But we did
the best we could. We made the best album and the best videos we could. We
don't have anything to be ashamed of."
