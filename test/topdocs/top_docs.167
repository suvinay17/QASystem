<TEXT>     It was the second Iraqi plane shot down in less than 48 hours, and the
incident came after Bush warned Iraq that U.S. forces would not hesitate to
shoot down any other Iraqi planes that fly.;    The U.S. military statement
said the plane downed today was hit in the vicinity of the key northern oil
city of Kirkuk, which has been the scene of fierce fighting between government
forces and Kurdish rebels.;    The fate of the Iraqi pilot was not immediately
known. The Central Command said the F-15C was one of two that were sent to the
scene to visually identify the Iraqi warplane before engaging it.;    It said
a second Iraqi aircraft, a PC-7 propeller-driven trainer, was flying with the
Su-22 but was not engaged. Preliminary reports indicated the pilot of the
trainer ejected after the Fitter was shot down, the command said.;    Other
details, such as the unit the U.S. planes belonged to or the number of
American planes on patrol over Iraq at the time, were not released.;    The
United States has been flying combat air patrols over Iraq since President
Bush declared a halt to hostilities on Feb. 28. The planes are armed with
air-to-air missiles and some have carried bombs to attack ground targets if
ordered to.;    On Wednesday, an American F-15C shot down one of two Iraqi
Su-22 jet fighters that were spotted flying near Saddam Hussein's hometown of
Tikrit, about 110 miles north of Baghdad. The other plane landed.;    White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at the time that the incident did not
mean hostilities had resumed. "We're not resuming hostilities. We're not
re-engaging," Fitzwater said.;    The United States has warned Iraq not to use
its planes against Kurdish insurgents in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslim
rebels in the south.;    Kurdish rebels claim that Iraqi government troops
have used helicopters and warplanes to drop napalm and incendiary bombs on
northern cities.;    Iraqi troops have tried to cut off supplies of food and
medicine to areas held by the insurgents. Iraqi warplanes and helicopters also
have attacked rebel-held northern oil fields, setting wells ablaze, Iraqi
opposition groups say.;    Secretary of State James Baker has acknowledged
that the U.S. ban on Iraq flying its planes has a "collateral effect" of
hindering Baghdad from fighting the rebels. But he has insisted the intent is
not to topple Saddam's government.;    Iraqi rebels reported sporadic clashes
with government forces in Baghdad today, the Muslim Sabbath, amid growing
anger over the alleged arrest of the elderly patriarch of the Shiite branch of
Islam.;    The opposition also reported fierce battles north of Najaf, the
Shiites' holiest city, where Imam Ali, the founder of the sect, is buried.;
Iran's official Tehran Radio also said rioting against Saddam Hussein has
spread to Baghdad. It said in an earlier report that Saddam had ordered a
state of emergency in the capital.;    Meanwhile, Kurdish sources said Jalal
Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and aides were on their
way to northern Iraq by road from Syria.;    The Kurds claimed they captured
Kirkuk, Iraq's northern oil center, on Wednesday and that most of the mountain
region has been purged of government forces. They said they would continue to
push south to link up with the Shiites, whose rebellion apparently has been
less successful.;    Bayan Jabr, spokesman for the Supreme Assembly of the
Islamic Revolution of Iraq, reiterated allegations that Grand Ayatollah
Abul-Kassem al-Khoei, the Shiite patriarch, had been arrested in Najaf.;
Jabr, speaking in Damascus, said helicopter-borne commandos "savagely
attacked" the school of theology in Najaf on Tuesday, battled with the rebels,
then arrested Khoei, his son and a number of aides. He said Khoei was flown to
Baghdad and forced to meet with Saddam Hussein.;    Khoei has not returned to
Najaf, and his whereabouts after the March 19 meeting with Saddam are not
known, they said.;    Shiite Iran protested the alleged arrest of Khoei, who
is 91. Iraq has accused Tehran of fueling the revolt against Saddam that began
after the allied victory in the gulf war.;    Jabr and Kurdish sources at
Talabani's office reported clashes in Baghdad neighborhoods, but said details
were still sketchy.;    "Our commandos are carrying out hit-and-run raids and
have clashed with government troops. But the rioting in Baghdad is still at a
small scale," said Jabr.;    He said both Shiites and Kurdish "commandos" were
involved in these attacks.  </TEXT>

   Laotian police have arrested two
Americans who had planned to float several thousand U.S. dollars
down the Mekong River in hopes of finding American soldiers they
believe are still being held in Communist Indochina, according to
the U.S. Embassy and one of the Americans.
   Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said the two were being held at
Ban Sing Samphan in the southern province Laotian of Champasak.
   ``We have advised our embassy in Vientiane of the arrest and our
embassy is checking with Lao authorities to determine what has
transpired,'' Petzing said.
   Donna Long, one of the two Americans, told the Associated Press
Sunday that they planned to drop plastic bags containing U.S.
dollars bills and other currencies into the Mekong River and to
pass out money in villages along the Laotian bank. Long revealed
the plan on condition it would not be released until the two
returned or were captured.
   Each bill was stamped with a message offering a $2.4 million
reward to anyone who could bring an American prisoner of war to the
International Red Cross.
   Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel manager, said Monday that
Long and the other American, who asked not to be identified, had
been captured by Laotian authorities.
   The Mekong forms a boundary with Thailand and then flows on to
both Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The reward money to any Cambodian, Laotian or Vietnamese is
being offered through the National Steering Committee for American
War Veterans, a private MIA-POW group. The group says the $2.4
million has been pledged by 21 congressmen and the American Defense
Institute, another group concerned with the MIA issue.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
from the Indochina War in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three
Indochinese governments deny that any Americans are alive in their
countries but some private American groups disagree.
   In 1987, several MIA-POW activists, including relatives of MIAs,
floated balloons down the Mekong River from the Thai shore with
offers of the $2.4 million reward, but with no known result.
   Members of the committee, including chairman Ted Sampley, were
scheduled to arrive in Thailand on Wednesday.
   Pornthipa, a manager at Ubon's Phatum Rat Hotel, said the two
had sought assistance in getting to the river and the hotel felt
obliged to help them.
   Long, 45, of Jacksonville, N.C., said they expected to travel
from Ubon to Khong Chaim on the banks of the Mekong and then
northward along the river to a Thai fishing village where they
could hire a boat to take them across to the Laotian shore.
   Petzing said the two were seized across from the Thai district
of Khong Chiam in an area where the Mun River flows into the Mekong.
   Long described herself as a ``POW-MIA activist'' whose now
deceased husband served three combat tours in Vietnam. In 1972 she
said she began wearing a bracelet inscribed with the name of Gary
La Bohn, a U.S. Special Forces sergeant who is listed as missing in
action in Laos in 1968.

   Police in Laos have captured two
Americans who said they planned to distribute dollar bills stamped
with a reward offer for any U.S. military personnel still held
captive in Indochina.
   Ross Petzing, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Donna Long of
Jacksonville, N.C., and another American were being held at Ban
Sing Samphan in the southern Laotian province of Champasak.
   Jerry Kiley of the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans identified the second American as Jim Copp of Hamstead,
N.C. Another committee member, John Nevin, said in Washington that
neither American had a visa to enter Laos.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters in
Washington that the U.S. Consulate in Udorn, Thailand, confirmed
that Lao authorities detained two Americans Monday on the Thai-Lao
border.
   ``The Americans had rented a boat and were on the Mekong River.
The Thai-Lao border does not run along the middle of the river but
evidently follows a varying line, and the Americans may have
accidentally floated into Lao territory,'' said Mrs. Oakley. ``We
are waiting for the Lao authorities to inform us whether the
Americans will be held and charged or released. Our counsel has not
yet met with them.''
   ``They looked so sad,'' said Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel
manager who crossed the Mekong River into Laos to see them Tuesday.
Ms. Pornthipa said she took the Americans clothing, food and
cigarettes but was not allowed to speak to them.
   Petzing said: ``We have advised our embassy in Vientiane of the
arrest and our embassy is checking with Lao authorities to
determine what has transpired.''
   On Sunday, Ms. Long told The Associated Press she and Copp
planned to drop plastic bags containing stamped dollars and other
currency into the river and pass out money in villages along
Laotian bank of the Mekong. She revealed the plan on condition it
not be revealed until the two left Laos or were captured.
   Each bill bears a message offering a $2.4 million reward to
anyone delivering an American prisoner of war to the International
Red Cross.
   Ms. Pornthipa said the Americans were held in a small house in
Ban Sing Samphan. She said Laotian authorities told her Monday they
would be freed within three days.
   She said the management of her hotel in Ubon felt some
responsibility because the Americans made contact with it before
starting the trip to the Mekong, which forms a boundary with
Thailand and flows to both Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The reward is being offered to Cambodians, Laotians and
Vietnamese through the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans, a private group. The committee says the money was pledged
by 21 congressmen and the American Defense Institute, another group
concerned with missing soldiers.
   The United States lists 2,393 Americans as still missing in
action in the Indochina war, which ended in 1975. The governments
of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia say no Americans are held in their
countries.
   Kiley, project director for American War Veterans, claimed 600
Americans are missing in Laos.
   ``The reason why these two peoples as private citizens are
jeopardizing themselves is because the United States government has
never acknowledged the existence of those POWs in Laos,'' he said
in a telephone interview in New York.
   Several activists, including relatives of MIAs, floated balloons
down the Mekong from the Thai shore last year with offers of the
reward, with no known result.
   Ms. Long said Sunday that she and Copp planned to travel from
Ubon to Khong Chaim on the banks of the Mekong, then north along
the river to a Thai fishing village where they could hire a boat to
take them across to the Laotian shore.
   Petzing said the two were seized across from the Khong Chiam
district in an area where the Mun River flows into the Mekong.
   Ms. Long described herself as a ``POW-MIA activist'' whose late
husband served three combat tours in Vietnam.

   Four Americans threw dollar bills
in the Mekong River Thursday and planned to direct a remote control
toy boat across to the Laotian side in efforts to free Americans
they believe are held in communist Indochina.
   The dollars, sealed in plastic envelopes, and the boat carry
offers of a $2.4 million reward for any American prisoner of war
brought out of Laos, Vietnam or Cambodia.
   Two members of the American group were captured by Laotian
authorities last Sunday when they hired a fishing boat at this
river town, dropped the bills into the Mekong and then went to a
Laotian village.
   Thai police said Donna Long, of Jacksonville, N.C., and James
Copp, of Hamstead, N.C., have been moved from the Laotian village
to the city of Pakse and possibly the Laotian capital of Vientiane.
   The remaining four members of the group on Thursday threw $25 to
$30 into the river, which flows on to Cambodia and Vietnam, as a
``test'' and planned to drop more than $2,000 in American and other
currencies Friday from the Thai shore.
   The boat, donated by a Florida toy manufacturer named Jim Rambo,
is to be steered by remote control to the Laotian shore and left
there. The speedy 2.5-foot boat is festooned with a flag reading
``You MIAs (missing in action) are not forgotten.''
   ``We are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will
work,'' said Bruce Adams, of Laramie, Wyo., whose brother was
listed as MIA in Laos 22 years ago.
   The reward money has been pledged by 21 U.S. congressmen and
others in the United States and the information about it is being
disseminated by the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans, one of a number of private American MIA-POW groups.
   ``We do not condone private forays. They have not proved helpful
and in many instances have proved counter-productive,`` said
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. William J. Crowe,
Jr. when asked about the group's activities along the Mekong.
   Crowe, who was visiting Bangkok, said although the U.S.
government put very high priority on the MIA issue, ``we have not
as yet been able to confirm a single case where (reports of live
Americans in Indochina proved) true.''
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as MIA from the
Indochina war in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three Indochinese
governments deny holding live Americans and both Laos and Vietnam
are extending help to the U.S. government in resolving the issue.

   Two Americans who planned to offer a
reward for the return of American MIAs by floating currency down
the Mekong River were arrested by authorities in Laos on Monday, a
Thai hotel executive said.
   Donna Long, 45, of Jacksonville, N.C. and another American, who
asked not to be identified, were arrested by Laotian authorities
and were being investigated, said the executive, Pornthipa
Vajarabukka.
   Miss Long told The Associated Press on Sunday the two planned to
drop plastic bags containing dollar bills and other currencies into
the river and to distribute the money in villages along the Laotian
bank of the river.
   The waterway forms a boundary with Thailand and then flows on to
both Cambodia and Vietnam. Each bill was stamped with a message
saying that a $2.4 million reward was being offered to anyone who
could bring an American prisoner of war to the International Red
Cross.
   Miss Long said the pair planned to hire a fishing boat near the
Thai city of Ubon, drop the packets into the river and then proceed
to the Laotian river bank. It was not known what the duo actually
did before they were seized.
   Miss Long revealed the plan on condition that the story was not
released until the two returned or were captured.
   The reward money to any Cambodian, Laotian or Vietnamese is
being offered through the National Steering Committee for American

Laos, something allowed for Thai nationals, on Tuesday to deliver
food and inquire about their status.

   The U.S. Embassy in Laos said today it
is trying to determine the fate of two Americans arrested after
they tried to advertise a $2.4 million reward for the return of
U.S. soldiers in Indochina.
   An embassy spokesman, contacted by telephone in Vientiane, said
the embassy received no response to a note sent to the Laotian
Foreign Ministry asking about the status of the Americans, who were
seized by authorities Sunday.
   Donna Long, 45, and James Copp, 43, had planned to float
thousands of dollars down the Mekong River offering the reward to
any Laotian, Cambodian or Vietnamese who brought an American
prisoner of war to the International Red Cross.
   The two had also planned to cross to the Laotian bank of the
boundary-marking river and advertise the award to local villagers.
   Ross Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said
Tuesday the two were being held at Ban Sing Samphan in the southern
Laotian province of Champasak. He could not confirm whether they
were still in the village today or had been moved.
   Long, of Jacksonville, N.C., has described herself as an MIA-POW
activist and revealed her plan Sunday to The Associated Press
before making the trip to the river. She was traveling with Copp, a
schoolteacher and Vietnam war veteran from Hampstead, N.C.
   Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel manager who visited the
Americans in Laos Tuesday, said she saw them but was not allowed to
speak to them.
   She said they were being held in a small house in the village.
She said authorities had told her Monday that the two would be
released within three days, but Tuesday refused to say when they
would be freed.
   Pornthipa said the hotel management felt responsible for the two
because they had made contact with the hotel before making the trip
on the river in a rented boat. The Americans speak neither Thai or
Lao and have limited knowledge of the area.
   The two carried $3,000 in single bills as well as some Russian
and Indonesian currency. Bills were stamped in red with the reward
offer and placed in plastic packets.
   The Mekong River forms a boundary with Thailand and then flows
on to both Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The reward money is being offered through the National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, a private MIA-POW group. The
group says the money has been pledged by 21 Congressmen and the

   A group of U.S. citizens claims
Thailand is trying to stop it from offering a $2.4 million reward
for the return of U.S. servicemen it believes remain held in
communist Indochinese countries.
   A Foreign Ministry official today said Thailand doesn't want the
group to distribute the reward offer because it would be seen as a
hostile act by Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and harm Thailand's
efforts to improve relations with these neighboring countries.
   The group said it was sponsoring seven Vietnam War veterans and
relatives of missing servicemen who plan to travel to Thailand in
October and float on the Mekong River Vietnamese currency notes
stamped with the reward offer. The money was pledged by former
North Carolina congressman Bill Hendon, former Vietnam War prisoner
Eugene McDaniel and 21 Republican congressmen.
   ``The government of Thailand is attempting to roadblock'' the
effort, said the group, the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, in a telex this week to The Associated Press
bureau in Bangkok.
   It said Ted Sampley, committee chairman and Vietnam War veteran,
met Aug. 26 with officials of the Thai Embassy in Washington and
was told: ``We have received word from Bangkok that you are not to
do this. If you violate our laws, you know what we must do.''
   The embassy officials refused to say what laws would be
violated, the telex said. ``We have no intention of violating any
Thai law, but if they are trying to short-circuit our plans because
of some political policy, they are going to have a problem,'' the
telex quoted Sampley as saying.
   He said: ``A very large part of the reason the U.S. became
involved in the Vietnam War was to protect Thailand, our most
valued friend and ally in Southeast Asia, from the threat of North
Vietnamese military adventurism. Over 58,000 Americans gave their
lives in that cause, and some of the Americans who fought that war
are still prisoners in Vietnam and Laos. I can't believe the Thai
government is trying prevent us from helping those men.''
   The Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he had not received any formal notice of the
group's plans.
   He said: ``It was an entirely American decision (to enter the
war). Thai soldiers also fought and died in a war that was
important for both countries. I don't accept Mr. Sampley's
reasoning.''
   Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper on Aug. 3 denounced
the reward offer, and the Thai offficial noted that Laos strongly
objected when relatives of servicemen missing in action, or MIA,
floated similar offers on the Mekong last year. Both countries have
angrily denied holding American prisoners.
   ``We're not opposed to the (MIA) group,'' the official said.
``But ... Thailand cannot permit the group to stage what is
regarded as provocative activities on its soil.
   The new government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choohavan has put
priority on improving relations with Indochina. Relations have been
sour since the communist victories in all three countries in 1975
and especially since 1979, when Vietnam invaded and occupied
Cambodia.
   Hendon led a group of MIA relatives who traveled to northeastern
Thailand last September and tossed into the Mekong plastic-bound
leaflets containing the reward offer to anyone who brings out a
prisoner. Thai authorities aborted the group's original plans to
float helium-filled balloons containing the leaflets across the
river, which also runs through Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The U.S. State Department criticized the actions of Hendon's
group, saying it hampered cooperation with the Laotian government
in resolving the fates of some 550 servicemen missing in Laos.
Publicly, Washington says it has no evidence of Americans held
prisoner but cannot discount that possibility.
   The veterans committee said the group traveling to Thailand in
October included: Bruce Adams of Laramie, Wyo., the brother of an
MIA; Lynn Hampton of Winter Haven, Fla., a Vietnam veteran nurse;
Jeffrey Donahue of Brookfield Center, Conn., brother of an MIA;
Kathryn Fanning of Oklahoma City, wife of an MIA; William Sullivan,
a veteran from Jacksonville, N.C.; John M.G. Brown, a veteran from
Petrolia, Calif.; and Sampley of Kinston, North Carolina.
   Adams and Donahue were among the group that floated the reward
offers on the Mekong last year.

   Four Americans said Wednesday they will
float dollar bills down the Mekong River to spread news of a $2.4
million reward for U.S. prisoners of war they say are alive in the
``black hole'' of Laos.
   Two other Americans, also from the National Steering Committee
for American War Veterans, were arrested this week while on a
similar mission.
   Laotian authorities on Sunday arrested Donna Long, 45, of
Jacksonville, N.C., and James Copp, 43, a Vietnam War veteran from
Hampstead, N.C., after they crossed the Mekong River in a rented
boat and landed in a village in Laos. The river forms the boundary
with Thailand, then flows to Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The six, four of whom are Vietnam War veterans, have said they
hope to trace American prisoners of war they believe are still
being held in the communist countries of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
   ``We call Laos the black hole of the MIA issue,'' said committee
chairman Ted Sampley, a former Green Beret from Kingston, N.C.
   The other members of the group are William Sullivan, of
Jacksonville, N.C., a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War; Lynn
Hampton, of Winter Haven, Fla., who served in the war as a nurse;
and Bruce Adams, a dentist from Laramie, Wyo.
   On Thursday, the four plan to travel to the northeastern Thai
city of Ubon and drop $2,000 into the Mekong River at the same spot
from which their colleagues left for Laos.
   Long and Copp carried about $3,000 as well as other currency
they planned to drop into the river or give to Laotian villagers.
Each dollar bill was stamped with the reward offer and wrapped in a
plastic bag.
   The members of the new expedition, who say they will not attempt
to cross the Mekong River, said Long and Copp had apparently ``gone
above and beyond what we asked them to do.''
   ``We're not Rambo types. We did not come over here in any kind
of militant mode,'' said Adams, whose brother Stephen was declared
missing in action in Laos 22 years ago. ``I don't want my brother's
bones back. I want the flesh and blood that goes with the man.''
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three governments deny holding
any live Americans.
   But the group, which claims the U.S. government has neglected
the issue, says it's convinced there are still American POWs in
Laos based on reports by refugees of having seen Americans, and
other evidence.
   Sampley said the money the group brought with them was pledged
by 21 congressmen, private individuals and corporate donors.
   The group of six were to have traveled together, Sampley said,
but airline reservations problems forced Long and Copp to arrive in
Thailand before the others.
   Ross Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said
Tuesday that Long and Copp were being held at Ban Sing Samphan in
the southern Laotian province of Champasak. He could not confirm
whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the
capital, Vientiane.
   Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel manager, said she visited
Long and Copp on Tuesday in a small house in the village, but was
not allowed to speak to them. She said authorities told her Monday
the two would be released within three days.
   Pornthipa added that she felt responsible for Long and Copp _
who speak neither Thai nor Lao _ because the Americans had
contacted the hotel before their trip across the river.
   It was not known if Long and Copp had floated money down the
river, and details of how they were arrested were not available.
   A U.S. Embassy official in Laos, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that the Laotian government has not
responded to an official query about the two Americans.

<HEAD>Laos Acknowledges Arresting Two Americans Offering MIA Reward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>

   Laos has acknowledged arresting two
Americans who entered the communist country to publicize a reward
to free American war prisoners.
   U.S. officials in Bangkok said the Laotian government has
informed the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane that it had arrested Donna
Long of Jacksonville, N.C., and former Linton, Ind. resident James
Copp, now of Hampstead, N.C.
   It was the first reported acknowledgment by Laos that its forces
had captured the pair.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said Sunday that Laos had
informed the American Embassy but added that ``we have no further
word regarding this case.''
   Ms. Long and Copp hired a Thai fishing boat, crossed the Mekong
River boundary between Thailand and Laos and were captured Oct. 3
in a Laotian village, according to Thais who were able to visit
them.
   Before setting off, Ms. Long told The Associated Press that they
intended to pass out dollar bills stamped with an offer of $2.4
million to any Laotian, Vietnamese or Cambodian who could produce a
live American being held in Indochina.
   Four American colleagues of Ms. Long and Copp dropped about
$1,000 worth of reward-stamped bills on Friday into the same area
of the Mekong. Much of the money eventually ended up in the hands
of Thai children.
   Meanwhile in the United States, five members of the Copp family
passed out strips of paper Saturday that urged people to call the
Laotian Embassy in Washington, D.C., to inquire about Copp and Ms.
Long.
   The family was in Indianapolis to visit The Moving Wall, a model
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that is on traveling exhibit.
   The family said Copp and Ms. Long had the appropriate papers to
visit Thailand but not Laos.
   ``This wasn't a Rambo mission,'' Bill Copp said of his brother's
activities. ``These were civilians and they were handing out the
currency. They were trying to make the government get something
done about the soldiers who may be missing or held prisoner.''
   ``He's not a renegade,'' Sandy Copp said of her brother, who
served in the Army in Vietnam in 1985. ``He just thinks it's about
time for those boys to come home.''
   The U.S. government still lists 2,393 Americans as missing in
action in the three Indochinese countries after the Vietnam War
ended in 1975, but no solid evidence has emerged that any are still
alive.
   The reward is being offered by 21 U.S. congressmen and private
American citizens.
   The six Americans in Southeast Asia seeking information on MIAs
are members of the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans, a private lobbying group.

   Four Americans sailed into Laotian
waters Friday and floated dollar bills stamped with a $2.4 million
reward offer for missing U.S. servicemen.
   Thai navy boats waved the group back to shore and retrieved the
money, but the Americans said they threw it back into the Mekong
River.
   The Americans tossed sealed plastic envelopes containing a total
of about $1,000 into the river after their two rented fishing boats
moved about 220 yards into Laotian waters. The Mekong forms a
boundary between Laos and Thailand and flows to Cambodia and
Vietnam.
   They also stuffed U.S. and Soviet currency into a toy boat
guided by remote control toward Laos.
   ``We are really encouraged. We had a great day,'' said Bruce
Adams, of Laramie, Wyo.
   Adams and the other three belong to a private lobbying group
called the National Steering Committee for American War Veterans.
They believe Americans taken prisoner during the Indochina war are
still held in communist Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
   Those three governments deny holding any Americans.
   Adams is convinced his brother Stephen remains captive in Laos
since he was reported missing 22 years ago.
   Laotian authorities captured two other members of the group
Sunday after they sailed into the same general area, tossed the
same reward offers into the river, then apparently landed at a
Laotian village.
   The U.S. Embassy in Vientiene said it has received no response
to its inquiry about the Americans _ Donna Long of Jacksonville,
N.C., and James Copp of Hampstead, N.C.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., was quoted by The Linton (Ind.)
Daily Citizen newspaper as saying Friday the State Department told
him the two are held in a compound in Vientiene, capital of Laos.
   ``The State Department is confident they will be out in a short
time,'' McCloskey was quoted as saying. ``I'm very optimistic they
will be released in a short time.''
   The Thai navy boat asked the Americans to stop tossing the
packets, waved them back to Thai shores, then began retrieving the
money.
   ``It won't work. It's incredibly stupid,'' one Thai officer told
reporters.
   The navy boat then escorted Ted Sampley, the group leader, to a
navy station where he was told the group's actions were not
allowed. An officer returned 90 packets of dollar bills to Sampley,
and the former Green Beret from Kingston, N.C., said he would have
to toss them back into the river.
   ``So we tossed them into the river from the Thai side and all
the kids enjoyed plunging into the Mekong to get them,'' said
Sampley.
   Lynn Hampton of Winter Haven, Fla., handed out balloons and
reward stickers to youngsters. Ms. Hampton was a nurse during the
Vietnam War.
   The other member of the group, William Sullivan of Jacksonville,
N.C., was in the Marine Corps during the war.
   The $2.4 million is being offered to any Laotian, Cambodian or
Vietnamese who brings out an American war prisoner. The money was
pledged by 21 U.S. congressmen and citizens.
   About 58,000 Americans died before U.S. forces withdrew from the
Vietnam War in 1973, and the U.S. government still lists 2,393
Americans as missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   Thai navy officials said the group's entry into Laotian waters
could jeopardize Thai-Laotian relations.
   The U.S. government also has criticized the reward offer as an
impediment to official contacts with the Indochinese governments to
account for the missing servicemen.

<TEXT>
   A Foreign Ministry official said
Thursday the government doesn't want a group of Americans to
distribute a $2.4 million reward for the return of missing U.S.
servicemen because it might offend Thailand's communist neighbors.
   The group said it was sponsoring seven Vietnam War veterans and
relatives of servicemen missing in Indochina who plan to travel to
Thailand in October and float on the Mekong River Vietnamese
currency notes stamped with the reward offer.
   ``The government of Thailand is attempting to roadblock'' the
effort, the National Steering Committee for American War Veterans
said in a telex this week to The Associated Press bureau in Bangkok.
   The money was pledged by former North Carolina Rep. Bill Hendon,
former Vietnam War prisoner Eugene McDaniel and 21 Republican
congressmen.
   The ministry official said the plan might be seen as a hostile
act by Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and harm Thailand's efforts to
improve relations with those neighbors.
   The group said Ted Sampley, committee chairman and Vietnam War
veteran, met Aug. 26 with officials of the Thai Embassy in
Washington and was told: ``We have received word from Bangkok that
you are not to do this. If you violate our laws, you know what we
must do.''
   The embassy officials refused to say what laws would be
violated, the telex said. ``We have no intention of violating any
Thai law, but if they are trying to short-circuit our plans because
of some political policy, they are going to have a problem,'' the
telex quoted Sampley as saying.
   The Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he had not received any formal notice of the
group's plans.
   Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper on Aug. 3 denounced
the reward offer, and the Thai official noted that Laos strongly
objected when relatives of servicemen missing in action, or MIAs,
floated similar offers on the Mekong last year. Both countries have
angrily denied holding American prisoners.
   The new government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choohavan has put
priority on improving relations with Indochina. Relations have been
sour since the communist victories in all three countries in 1975
and especially since 1979, when Vietnam invaded and occupied
Cambodia.

   A team of U.S. and Vietnamese
investigators found two sets of human remains and debris from a
wrecked aircraft during an unprecedented search for the airmen
missing in the Vietnam war, officials say.
   Four Americans, meanwhile, floated dollar bills down the Mekong
River in Laos today to spread news of a $2.4 million reward for
prisoners of war they say still may be alive.
   The group also said it would direct a remote control toy boat to
the Laotian shore to carry offers of the reward.
   Two other Americans were arrested on a similar mission and were
believed still being held Wednesday by authorities in Laos.
   One set of remains located by the U.S.-Vietnamese search team
was found at the Lang Son province bordering China with the remains
of Vietnamese, and probably is not American, U.S. investigators
said.
   But Bill Bell, a U.S. team leader, said searchers found areas
where other remains might be buried and recovered pieces of
aircraft wreckage. They finished their eight-day search through
five provinces near Hanoi on Tuesday.
   The U.S. specialists left Wednesday for Bangkok, Thailand, but
planned to return to Hanoi on Friday to discuss their findings and
the possibility of more joint work, including excavations of crash
sites.
   The teams trekked through steep mountains in pouring monsoon
rains to reach sites where six airmen were shot down during the
war, which ended in 1975.
   Villagers led investigators to two sets of remains, in Lang Son
and Ha Nam Ninh provinces, said Nguyen Can, head of Vietnam's
Office For Seeking Missing Personnel.
   Can said the remains will be given to the United States after
preliminary analysis by Vietnamese forensic experts. He said
Vietnam does not have equipment for identifying the teeth, the key
part of both sets of remains.
   It was the first time Vietnam allowed U.S. experts to probe the
countryside and because it may resolve some cases Washington
considers top priority among the 1,757 missing in Vietnam.
   Meanwhile, a private group of searchers believes missing
servicemen are alive in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The four Americans threw $25 to $30 into the river, which flows
on to Cambodia and Vietnam, as a ``test'' and planned to drop more
than $2,000 in American and other currencies Friday from the Thai
shore.
   The boat, donated by a Florida toy manufacturer named Jim Rambo,
is to be remote steered to the Laotian shore and left there. The
speedy, 2.5-foot boat is festooned with a flag reading ``You
(missing in action) are not forgotten.''
   ``We are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will
work,'' said Bruce Adams, of Laramie, Wyo., whose brother was
listed as MIA in Laos 22 years ago.
   The other members of the group are Ted Sampley, a former Green
Beret from Kingston, N.C.; William Sullivan, of Jacksonville, N.C.,
a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War; and Lynn Hampton, of
Winter Haven, Fla., a nurse during the war.
   The group is the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans.
   Laotian authorities Sunday arrested two other members of the
group, Donna Long, 45, of Jacksonville, N.C., and James Copp, 43, a
Vietnam veteran from Hampstead, N.C., after they crossed the Mekong
River and landed in a Laotian village.
   Long and Copp carried about $3,000 as well as other currency.
Each bill was stamped with the reward offer.
   Ross Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said
Tuesday that Long and Copp were being held at Ban Sing Samphan in
the southern Laotian province of Champasak. He could not confirm
whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the
capital, Vientiane.

   Four Americans entered Laos today
and began floating dollar bills down the Mekong River to advertise
a $2.4 million reward for missing U.S. servicemen, but the Thai
navy scooped up most of the money.
   The Americans dumped the money, stamped with the reward offer
and sealed in plastic envelopes, into the river after their two
boats moved about 220 yards into Laotian waters.
   They stuffed other bills into a toy boat guided by remote
control towards the Laotian shore.
   However, a Thai naval patrol boat waved the Americans back to
the Thai side of the river and retrieved 62 of about 100 packets
tossed into the river, then returned the money.
   ``It won't work. It's incredibly stupid,'' said one Thai navy
officer.
   Two members of the American team were arrested earlier this week
after entering Laos. They are believed still held by Laotian
authorities.
   The Americans are offering $2.4 million to any Laotian,
Cambodian or Vietnamese who brings an American out of these nations.
   The Americans, members of a group called National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, say the reward money has been
pledged by 21 U.S. congressmen and others in the United States.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
from fighting in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three governments
deny holding live Americans, and Laos and Vietnam are helping
Washington resolve the issue.
   The four Americans are Ted Sampley, a former Green Beret from
Kingston, N.C.; William Sullivan, of Jacksonville, N.C., a Marine
Corps veteran of the Vietnam War; Lynn Hampton, of Winter Haven,
Fla., a nurse during the war; and Bruce Adams, a dentist from
Laramie, Wyo.
   Thai navy officials said their entry into Laotian waters could
jeopardize Thai-Laotian relations.
   ``We don't want this to become a problem between Thailand and
Laos,'' said one official at the naval station in Khong Chiam.
``Entering Laotian waters will give our neighbors the impression
that we endorse this activity.''
   The Mekong forms a boundary between Laos and Thailand and flows
to Cambodia and Vietnam. Although Thai-Laotian relations are
improving, a number of clashes have occurred between the two
countries since the 1975 communist victory in Laos.
   The 62 packets of money were given back to the Americans, who
distributed some to local children and dropped others into the
Mekong from the Thai shore. About two dozen children leaped in to
retrieve as many as they could.
   The mood turned festive as Ms. Hampton handed out ballons and
reward stickers to excited youngsters.
   The Americans last saw their toy boat near the Laotian side of
the river, which is about a half-mile wide at the spot.
   Two members of their group were captured by Laotian authorities
Sunday when they hired a fishing boat, dropped bills into the
Mekong, and then went on to a Laotian village.
   Thai police say Donna Long, of Jacksonville, N.C., and James
Copp, of Hampstead, N.C., have been moved from the river village to
Pakse City and possibly the Laotian capital of Vientiane.
   The U.S. Embassy in Laos said it has not been informed of their
whereabouts or status.

   The State Department on Thursday criticized
two Americans who were arrested in Laos earlier this month while
trying to obtain information about any American servicemen who may
still be held in Indochina.
   James Copp of Hampstead, N.C., and Donna Long,of Jacksonville,
N.C., were arrested on Oct. 3 after entering Laos for the purpose
of advertising a $2.4 million reward for the safe return of a live
American war prisoner, department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   ``We understand the motives behind this kind of effort,'' Redman
said. ``But our view is that this could jeopardize ongoing U.S.-Lao
cooperation to resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   ``We also are concerned that any reward reinforces the
perception widely held in Indochina, particularly among refugees,
that information and remains are items of barter.''
   The spokesman said there is no evidence that the previous
attempts to obtain information about American POW's through the
offer of rewards has produced positive results.
   Copp and Ms. Long were arrested in a remote area of Laos for
illegally entering the country and later were taken to the capital,
Vientiane, where they were reported Monday by a U.S. consular
official to have been well treated and well fed, Redman said.
   He said the U.S. government is asking Laotian authorities for a
determination on whether they will be charged or released.
   ``The United States is deeply committed to the return of any and
all Americans who may still be held in Indochina. We believe the
issue can only be resolved through government-to-government
cooperation, which has recently increased in the case of Laos,''
Redman said.
   He said a team of Lao officials next week will visit an Army
laboratory in Hawaii where remains of returned American servicemen
are identified. In addition. U.S. experts soon will visit a site in
Laos where Americans are believed to have died in a plane crash
during the war.
   That visit will occur after the same experts carry out a joint
investigation in Vietnam on the whereabouts of missing Americans.
   Copp and Ms. Long reportedly were aboard a boat that floated to
the Lao side of the Mekong River. They were said to be attempting
to float packets containing reward notices written on U.S. dollar
bills and other paper currency. The river borders on or cuts
through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam _ where a combined total of
about 2,400 Americans are unaccounted for.
   On Wednesday, three Vietnam veterans said they were prepared to
risk arrest in Laos to publicize their claim that the U.S.
government ignores evidence that some Americans captured in
Indochina are still alive.
   ``This government, this administration, has failed miserably in
their stated highest national priority, the prisoner-of-war
issue,'' said Ted Sampley, chairman of the National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, a private veterans' lobby
based in Kinston, N.C.

   A U.S. official met for the first time
today with two Americans who were detained after entering Laos to
publicize a $2.4 million reward for missing U.S. servicemen, a U.S.
Embassy official in Laos said.
   ``They looked all right and they did not allege any
mistreatment,'' the U.S. official said. ``But we still have no idea
of the charges against them or how the case will be disposed of.''
   Donna Long of Jacksonville, N.C., and James Copp of Hampstead,
N.C., took a rented fishing boat across the Mekong River boundary
between Thailand and Laos and were arrested Oct. 3 at a village in
the southern province of Champasak.
   They were moved last Wednesday to the Laotian capital of
Vientiane.
   The two were planning to pass out dollar bills and other
currency offering the reward to anyone who frees a U.S. prisoner
from communist-ruled Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam and turns him over
to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   These countries deny holding any Americans from the Vietnam War,
which ended in 1975.
   A U.S. Embassy consular officer was granted access to the two
Americans today after repeated requests, said the embassy official,
reached by telephone in Vientiane.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Long
and Copp were being held at the passport office building, where
other foreigners have been held in recent years, generally for
illegal entry.
   The two are members of the National Steering Committee For
American War Veterans, a private lobbying group. The $2.4 million
reward for MIAs was offered by 21 U.S. congressmen and private
citizens.
   On Oct. 7, four other members of the committee sailed into the
same area of the Mekong and dropped stamped currency notes into the
water before the Thai navy told them to return to the Thai shore.
   That group was led by committee chairman Ted Sampley, a former
Green Beret from Kinston, N.C. He said last week the committee
would send another group of Vietnam War veterans to the Laotian
side of the river if Ms. Long and Copp were not freed soon.
   ``We will give Lao government officials some more Americans to
put in their jails until Jim and Donna are released so they can
return to their families,'' Sampley said in a telephone interview
from Kinston.
   The U.S. Embassy official in Vientiane said the Laotian
government was irritated at the group's activities on the Mekong,
and the official media there called it ``silly and insulting.''
   ``They find it offensive to them and their sovereignty and their
previous statements that they are not holding any live Americans,''
he said.
   However, he said Laos has not tried to link the episode to
overall relations with the United States.
   The United States still seeks to account for 2,393 Americans
listed as missing in action in the Southeast Asia war, but no solid
evidence has emerged that any are alive.

   An activist veterans group, contending there
still are U.S. war prisoners in Indochina, is seeking a country
that will offer asylum to anyone who brings out a living POW, a
spokesman for the group said Monday.
   Ted Sampley, head of the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, said the organization believes it can get an
American out within six months after asylum is guaranteed.
   The group has written officials of the Australian, British,
Canadian, New Zealand, French and Swedish embassies asking that
they offer a guarantee since the United States has not.
   U.S. officials have criticized independent efforts to find POWs
in Southeast Asia, saying they jeopardize official efforts to
resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   Two members of Sampley's organization were held prisoner for 41
days in Laos last year after they entered the country to publicize
a reward of more than $2 million offered by several members of
Congress for the safe return of a prisoner of war.
   Earlier, the veterans group put $2,000 worth of Vietnamese,
Laotian and other currency in plastic bags and floated the bags
down the Mekong River with notices of the reward.
   While U.S. officials say they have seen no proof that missing
soldiers remain alive in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia, they do not
rule out the possibility. About 2,400 U.S. servicemen are listed as
missing in action in Southheast Asia.
   Sampley said as many as 100 still could be alive in Vietnam and
scores more in other communist-controlled countries in the region.
   He said an affiliate organization, Homecoming II, has had
contact with an officer of an Indochinese country who is willing to
bring out an American POW if he and others who would come with him
can be assured of political asylum as well as the reward.
   Sampley said he could not give the name of the officer, his
country or any other details about him for fear he might be
arrested.
   The American would be brought out within 180 days after asylum
is guaranteed, said Sampley, who has a construction business in
Kinston, N.C.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 23 Sets Of Remains</HEAD>

   Vietnam today turned over to a U.S.
military team what it believes are the remains of 23 Americans
unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, a U.S. spokesman said. It was
one of the largest such turnovers.
   A U.S. military honor guard solemnly saluted as the remains, in
coffins draped with folded U.S. flags, were loaded onto a Hercules
C-141 transport plane during a short ceremony at Hanoi's Noi Bai
Airport, Maj. Dan Trout said.
   The plane left the Vietnamese capital for Guam, en route to
Honolulu. There, the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory will try
to confirm the preliminary analyses done by the Vietnamese, said
Trout, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   Trout said the remains included 21 sets the Vietnamese found in
their own searches and the two sets that U.S.-Vietnamese teams
recovered during unprecedented joint field investigations near Hanoi
from Sept. 25 to Oct. 5.
   The Vietnamese provided a list of some names and information on
the remains, Trout said without elaborating. Sources said earlier
that Vietnam has given the United States a list of at least nine
names.
   Today's return was among the largest since the January 1973 Paris
Peace Accords ended U.S. military involvement in a war that claimed
58,000 American lives. The communists defeated the U.S.-backed South
Vietnam government in April 1975.
   Trout said that since the accords, the United States has received
the identified remains of 196 missing persons, including 168 from
Vietnam, 26 from Laos and two from China. That leaves 2,387
Americans missing in action, or MIA, in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   In August 1987, Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, and
a special U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John W. Vessey,
reached agreement to hasten cooperation on the MIA issue.
   Today's turnover brought to 90 the number of suspected remains
Vietnam has provided since the Thach-Vessey agreement. So far, the
U.S. laboratory has identified 25 set of remains as those of missing
Americans.
   Also today, seven U.S. military specialists returned to Bangkok
after winding up a second joint field investigation with the
Vietnamese. They were to have inspected U.S. warplane crash sites
and other areas west of Hanoi during the 10-day project, Trout said.
   ``They didn't run into any serious weather problems,'' Trout
said. ``They did not find any specific remains this time.''
   He said that as with the first joint investigation, the teams
were trying to resolve ``discrepancy cases'' _ those in which the
United States says there is evidence Vietnamese authorities have
information on the servicemen's fate. These includes cases of airmen
captured but never returned.
   Most American losses in northern Vietnam were airmen shot down
during bombing runs.
   Vietnam had for years refused repeated requests for the field
investigations. U.S. officials said they were gratified by the
recent cooperation on the issue, long subjected to emotional
bickering between the two countries.
   But Ted Sampley, head of the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, on Wednesday accused the Vietnamese of using
turnovers for political ends.
   ``They are timing it for the presidential election,'' Sampley
said in a telephone interview from the United States.
   The committee, a private lobbying group, has accused Washington
of pursuing only the remains of the dead while covering up purported
evidence of Americans still held prisoner in Indochina.

<HEAD>War Veterans Offer $5,000 Bounty To Laotian Insurgents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. war veterans seeking the release of
colleagues they claim are being held in Laos said today that they
are offering anti-communist Laotian insurgents $5,000 to destroy a
government building.
   The veterans have formed a ``war council'' and are offering the
money for the first significant government building the insurgents
destroy, group spokesman Ted Sampley said.
   ``We believe the only way the truth and any living American
prisoner of war will ever be liberated from Laos is if the Pathet
Lao (communist party) are driven from Laos,'' he said. ``We're going
to encourage (the insurgents) to take on the Pathet Lao any way they
can.''
   Sampley, who spoke in a telephone interview from the United
States, is chairman of the National Steering Committee For Vietnam
War Veterans. The private lobbying group has accused the U.S.
government of failing to secure the release of Americans held from
the Indochina War, which ended with communist victories in Cambodia,
Laos and Vietnam in 1975.
   The Laotian government has repeatedly denied holding any
Americans from the war and has reacted angrily to private
initiatives.
   The U.S. government also has criticized these private
initiatives, preferring official contacts with the Laotian
authorities, whom it says have increased cooperation in recent
months.
   A total of 547 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action, or MIA, in Laos, but U.S. officials said all but one are
presumed dead.
   ``If the Reagan administration will encourage private citizens to
help the Contras (insurgents in Nicaragua), then by God we can help
the Laotians against the Pathet Lao communists,'' said Sampley, a
former Green Beret from Kinston, N.C.
   He said the $5,000 had been donated by a private U.S. citizen but
would not identify the person.
   Insurgents based along the Thai and Chinese borders have fought
the Laotian government since the Pathet Lao seized power in December
1975, but do not appear to pose a major security risk. The U.S.
government says it gives no support to the insurgents.
   In October, Sampley led a group of Americans to Thailand. On the
Mekong River, which separates Thailand and Laos, they floated
currency notes stamped with another reward offer _ $2.4 million to
anyone who brings out a live prisoner.
   Two members of the group were detained by the Laotians for 41
days after they illegally crossed to the Laotian side of the river.
   Last month, U.S. and Laotian experts conducted their fourth joint
excavation of a U.S. warplane crash site in Laos and found one set
of human remains.
   The MIA issue was expected to be discussed during talks this week
between Laos' deputy foreign minister, Soubanh Srithirath, and
Richard Childress, director of Asian affairs at the U.S. National
Security Council.
   Childress was accompanied on the trip by Ann Mills Griffiths, the
head of the National League of POW-MIA Families, a private lobbying
group.
   The official Laotian radio said Soubanh and Childress met in
Laos' capital of Vientiane on Monday and were expected to meet again
today.
   ``The consultative meeting proceeded in a good and
straightforward atmosphere,'' said a text of Monday's broadcast,
which was seen in Bangkok today.

   A Vietnamese official said his nation on
Thursday will turn over to the United States 23 sets of remains that
may be those of Americans missing from the Vietnam War.
   A U.S. Embassy official confirmed Wednesday that remains would be
handed over, but put the number at 21.
   The remains include the two sets that U.S.-Vietnamese teams
recovered during last month's unprecedented joint field
investigations in northern Vietnam, Tran Viet Tan, consul general of
the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, said Wednesday.
   The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity. Sources said
Vietnam has given the United States a list of at least nine names
associated with the remains.
   A U.S. military team is to receive the remains in a ceremony at

   Trout said the United States has identified 25 missing Americans
among the 77 remains Vietnam has returned since the agreement. The
most recent handover was of 25 remains on July 13.

   Bruce Adams of Laramie, Wyo., says he doesn't
want his brother's bones back in a bag, because after 22 years he
still believes Master Sgt. Steven H. Adams is alive in Southeast
Asia.
   Adams, whose brother's name is carved onto the Vietnam Memorial
as missing and presumed dead, said Friday he will join a Vietnam
veterans group's unusual effort to advertise a $2.4 million reward
to any Vietnamese, Lao or Cambodian citizen who brings out a live
American POW.
   The National Steering Committee for American War Veterans plans
to go to the Thailand-Vietnam border in October and distribute
thousands of dollars worth of Vietnamese currency stamped with a
message offering the reward which has been pledged privately by
several congressmen and others.
   If not stopped by the Thai government, which hindered a private
U.S. effort last year to send reward offers up in hundreds of
balloons, the group said it will float the bills in plastic bags
down the Mekong River and distribute them along the Thai side of
the river.
   ``I don't want bones. I want the live man. I want my brother,''
Adams told a news conference.
   He said in an interview that his brother, who would be 41 if he
is still alive, was shot down with six other Air Force personnel on
Oct. 18, 1966, over the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin.
   Adams, a dentist, said that a few months ago a woman who had
worked for the Red Cross in Laos during the war verified
information that his family received from the Red Cross 10 months
after he was shot down. The woman said she had seen his brohter
severely injured but alive in 1967 and was surprised the U.S.
military concluded he was dead.
   Adams said he has also received information from a non-American
source, whom he said he promised not to identify, that his brother
was now held in a camp in Laos.
   ``I have not seen any black and white evidence, but I believe he
is alive,'' Adams said.
   The veterans group's chairman, Ted Sampley, said the effort to
advertise the reward by stamping Vietnamese bills originated with
former Vietnam Army nurse Lynn Hampton, who took it upon herself to
write messages on 3,000 bills she secretly distributed during a
recent visit to Vietnam with a missionary group.
   Ms. Hampton of Winter Haven, Fla., said she found no direct
evidence of live American prisoners during her visit.
   Sampley urged U.S. officials not to try to stop the
bill-stamping effort.
   ``It may seem weird, but it's going to do what we want it to do
_ advertise the reward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Americans Looking For MIAa To Float Messages On River</HEAD>

   A group of Americans hoping to publicize
a $2.4 million reward for the release of any American prisoners of
war plan to float 600 tiny boats across the river dividing Thailand
from Laos.
   Each foam vessel to be floated Wednesday is six inches in
diameter and will carry a rolled message in Thai pinned with a
bamboo toothpick reading:
   ``This boat represents one of about 600 Americans who are still
unaccounted for in Laos. May this effort appease the spirits of
those who have died and help bring back to their families those who
are still living.''
   The U.S. State Department lists 2,393 Americans as missing in
action in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia after the Indochina war, which
ended in 1975 with communist victories. In recent months,
cooperation between the United States and the governments of Laos
and Vietnam has increased in an effort to resolve the issue.
   The State Department has criticized private efforts to resolve
the issue.
   Geographer Michael B. Caron, of Lawrence, Kan., said he and three
other Americans hope to gather information on Americans they believe
are still being held prisoner. Laos has repeatedly denied it holds
any Americans.
   Of the 2,393 MIA cases, the State Department has classified 1,128
as ``killed in action-body not recovered.'' The other 1,265 were
labeled ``prisoner of war-missing in action,'' but all but one case
were changed to the status of presumed dead.

   The four Americans, who are based in the northeastern province of
Nakhon Phanom bordering Laos, are members of ``Homecoming II,'' a
private MIA-POW group based in Shawnee Mission, Kan.
   They say they will enlist the help of Thai children to help them
transport and float the small craft on the Mekong River at sunset
Wednesday.
   Two other Americans on a similiar mission crossed the Mekong and
entered Laos illegaly on Oct. 3. to advertise the reward, financed
by donations from U.S. congressmen and private individuals.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both from North Carolina, were
arrested and imprisoned for 41 days. They were released after a U.S.
veterans' group paid $1,500 in administrative fees and canceled a
planned protest.
   Wednesday's planned launch of the messages coincides with the
ancient Thai ``Loy Krathong'' festival, when banana leaf boats are
floated and prayers offered to the water spirits.
   ``Our intention is to stay out of trouble, not to set off
instant, negative alarm that could come back and hurt the Thais,''
said Caron.
   He said he and his colleagues arrived in Thailand three weeks ago.

   Americans searching for U.S. prisoners
of war in communist Laos today had several hundred Thai children
float tiny foam boats with messages across the Mekong River to Laos,
a spokesman said.
   Dr. Amos Townsend, a member of the group, said unfavorable winds
made it unlikely many of the 600 small craft would reach the Laotian
bank, but he said the ``message would get across.'' The Mekong River
divides Thailand and Laos.
   Each boat, six inches in diameter, carried a written note that
read: ``This boat represents one of about 600 Americans who are
still unaccounted for in Laos. May this effort appease the spirits
of those who have died and help bring back to their families those
who are still living.''
   The U.S. State Department lists 547 Americans as missing in Laos
from the Indochina war.
   Townsend said in a telephone interview the group was hoping to
publicize a $2.4-million reward for the return of any live American
POW in Indochina. But he said the boats did not carry information
about the monetary reward.
   The launch coincided with the ancient Thai ``Loy Krathong''
festival. Celebrated on the full moon each November, Thais set
banana leaf boats on bodies of water and offer prayers to the water
spirits.
   Townsend and three other Americans are based in the northeastern
province of Nakhon Phanom bordering Laos where the craft were
launched and where they hope to establish a ``long-term presence''
and gather information on Americans they believe are still being
held.
   Two other Americans were recently imprisoned for 41 days after
entering Laos illegally to advertise the same reward, which has been
offered by several U.S. congressmen and private individuals.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both from North Carolina, were freed
after a U.S. veterans group paid $1,500 and canceled a protest
planned near the Laotian Embassy in Washington to demand their
release.
   Laos has repeatedly denied it holds any Americans. The recent
foray by the two Americans prompted criticism from the U.S. State
Department, which wants to resolve the issue of missing Americans
through official contacts with the Laotian government.
   More than 2,380 Americans are still listed as missing in action,
or MIA, in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia from the Indochina war, which
ended in 1975 with communist victories in those countries.
   In recent months, cooperation has increased between the United
States and the governments of Laos and Vietnam in an effort to
resolve the issue.

   Two Americans who illegally entered Laos
in search of American prisoners of war were freed Saturday after
their supporters paid $1,500 and canceled a protest at the Laotian
Embassy in Washington.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both of North Carolina, arrived in
Bangkok on a flight from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. They
appeared exhausted after 41 days of detention, 32 of them in
solitary confinement.
   The two entered communist Laos to advertise a reward offer for
the release of U.S. POWS from the Indochina war.
   ``It was a horrible 41 days, but I don't regret it,'' said Miss
Long, who lost 15 pounds. ``The only hope that our men in Laos have
is that someone brings them out.'' She said a stern-looking police
colonel told them that while they were being freed, any others who
entered Laos illegally would not be.
   ``They would stay forever, forever,'' she quoted the colonel as
saying.
   Miss Long, a 45-year-old writer from Jacksonville, N.C., and
Copp, a 44-year-old schoolteacher from Hampstead, N.C., were taken
into custody Oct. 3.
   They had sailed across the Mekong River boundary between Thailand
and Laos, entered a Laotian village, and distributed leaflets
advertising a $2.4 million reward for the return of any American war
prisoner. The reward has been pledged by 21 Republican congressmen
and some private citizens.
   Laos has denied holding prisoners from the war, from which U.S.
forces withdrew in 1973. Washington has criticized Miss Long and
Copp, saying what they did jeopardized official efforts to account
for 547 Americans listed as missing in action in Laos.
   When an angry policeman saw Miss Long and Copp in the village,
the two rushed down a hill and a Thai who was hired to navigate the
boat started the engine. But the policeman ordered him to cut the
engine. The Thai was released quickly.
   The Americans said they were kept in the village for a day, then
moved to Pakse city for a few days stay before being flown to
Vientiane.
   Upon landing, the two were put in a jeep manned by two men with
machine guns, who blindfolded them. They were driven into the garage
of what they later found out was the immigration building, a
five-minute walk from the U.S. Embassy.
   In the garage, they feared the worst.
   ``It got really dark,'' said Miss Long. ``Then everybody got out
of the jeep and the only people still in the jeep were us and the
two people with the guns behind us. I thought this was it, the big
one.''
   ``I thought we would be shot in the back of the head,'' Copp said.
   Instead they were taken up to their separate rooms to begin their
solitary confinement. In Pakse, the two had to sign statements that
they had intruded into Laos and caused problems.
   Miss Long said that in Vientiane, ``I was interrogated on
numerous occasions and they would take that statement and over and
over again ask the same questions. They wanted to know just about
everything. They kept asking me who is your boss and who sent you
here.''
   In her last session, on Oct. 29, they asked: ``Why do you help to
try to find criminals? American servicemen ... bombed our houses,
killed our people, people who did nothing to them. They are
criminals.''
   Miss Long said the police colonel complained people were
abandoning their work and searching for the American servicemen in
order to collect the reward. He said people were crossing the river
into Thailand to find out more about the reward.
   Miss Long said she spent her time exercising, singing, and making
things, including a deck of cards from cigarette packs to play
solitaire.
   Copp said a plant grew in the corner of his rat-infested room,
and at one point, he did not speak to anyone for two weeks.
   He said his trip into Laos ``wasn't a mistake. I'm more convinced
than ever that there are prisoners of war there.''
   Donald Stader, a State Department official, said in Washington on
Friday that Laotian authorities agreed to release the pair in return
for $1,500 in administrative costs.
   Another condition imposed by Laos, he said, was that a U.S.
veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the Laotian
Embassy in Washington Friday to protest the detention.
   The National Steering Committee for American Vietnam War Veterans
canceled the protest and gave the $1,500 fee to Stader.

   Three Vietnam veterans vowed Wednesday to
court arrest in Laos in a bid to publicize claims the U.S.
government ignores evidence that some Americans captured in the
conflict are still alive.
   ``This government, this administration, has failed miserably in
their stated highest national priority, the prisoner-of-war
issue,'' said Ted Sampley, chairman of the National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, a private veterans' lobby
based in Kinston, N.C.
   American authorities are so eager for cooperation from Laos and
Vietnam in digging up old U.S. warplane crash sites for traces of
the dead that they conceal or ignore information about those still
living, Sampley told a news conference.
   State Department officials disputed the accusations.
   Sampley said both Indochinese and U.S. sources have provided
evidence about living American POWs in Vietnam and Laos.
   He said he and two fellow veterans will cross the Mekong from
Thailand to Laos early next month unless the Laotian government
frees two North Carolina activists arrested Oct. 3 for illegal
entry, James Copp of Hampstead and Donna Long of Jacksonville.
Sampley, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army special forces, said he
would be accompanied by ex-U.S. Marines Jim Solomon and Bill
Sullivan.
   State Department Press Officer Alex Almasov said the department
believes that while there is no proof of Americans detained against
their will, the possibility still exists.

authorities on Oct. 2 while on a prisoner of war rescue mission are
expected to be released soon, a State Department official said
Friday.
   Donna Long, of Jacksonville, and James Copp, of Hampstead, were
taken into custody while distributing leaflets advertising a $2.4
million reward for the return of a living American prisoner from the
Indochina war.
   Donald Stader, a State Department official responsible for
Southeast Asia, said in a telephone interview Laotian authorities
agreed to release the pair in return for $1,500 in administrative
costs.
   That sum was based on a judicial proceeding in Vientiane, the
Laotian capital where Ms. Long and Copp were taken after they were
detained in a remote area of the country, Stadler said.
   Another condition imposed by the Laotians, Stader said, was that
a U.S. veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the
Laotian Embassy in Washington on Friday to protest the detention of
Ms. Long and Copp.
   After being advised of the Laotian conditions, the National
Steering Committee for American Vietnam War Veterans canceled the
protest and turned over the $1,500 fee to Stader. Laotian
authorities subsequently were notified that both their demands had
been met.
   Stader said he was not aware of any further obstacles to the
release of the Americans. Both have been well treated, he said.
   Copp and Ms. Long reportedly were aboard a boat that floated to
the Lao side of the Mekong River when they were detained. They were
said to be attempting to float packets containing reward notices
written on U.S. dollar bills and other paper currency. The river
borders on or cuts through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam _ where a
combined total of about 2,400 Americans are unaccounted for.
   After the Americans were detained, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said private efforts to obtain information about
missing Americans are counterproductive.
   ``We understand the motives behind this kind of effort,'' Redman
said. ``But our view is that this could jeopardize ongoing U.S.-Lao
cooperation to resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   ``We also are concerned that any reward reinforces the perception
widely held in Indochina, particularly among refugees, that
information and remains are items of barter.''
   The spokesman said there is no evidence that the previous
attempts to obtain information about American POW's through the
offer of rewards has produced positive results.

<HEAD>Thousands Roll Past White House in Support of Missing in Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts staged a
``rolling thunder'' rally Sunday past the White House and the
Soviet and Laotian embassies to protest the handling of America's
missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   ``The effort is to keep alive before the public and the media an
issue the White House is trying to lay to rest,'' said Ted Sampley
of Kinston, N.C., one of the organizers.
   National Park Police estimated that 15,000 people took part in
the rally and an associated ``Rock for Freedom'' concert and
demonstration held near the Lincoln and Vietnam Memorials.
   Thousands of cyclists gathered shortly before noon at the
Pentagon before motoring past the White House along a
police-approved route.
   Police rejected a request for a permit for the cyclists to motor
en masse past the Soviet and Laotian embassies, claiming it would
tie up traffic, according to the event's organizers.
   Nonetheless, groups of five to 20 cyclists at a time rumbled in
ad hoc ``thunder alley runs'' throughout the afternoon in front of
the embassies, where organizers handed out patches with skulls and
crossbones to riders as they passed.
   ``The authorities have done everything in their power to
interfere with this thing,'' said Sampley, who chairs a group
called the National Steering Committee for American War Veterans.
``The State Department did not want us over at the Laotian
Embassy.''
   He said the embassy was targeted because Laos ``never has
answered publicly'' what became of the U.S. prisoners they were
holding at the end of the war.
   About 2,300 Americans are now listed by the government as
missing in action in the Vietnam War, which also included fighting
in Cambodia and Laos. The war ended in 1975 with Communist
victories in all three countries.
   Of the missing, 537 were in Laos when last seen _ most of them
in areas then under control of North Vietnamese forces, according
to U.S. officials.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm lauded George Bush as ``the
greatest vice president this nation has ever had'' and said his
Democratic rival would raise taxes, ``wimp America and endanger
peace,'' as he placed Bush's name in nomination for the presidency
Wednesday.
   Gramm, the Texan best known for the budget-cutting plan that
bears his name, described Bush as a certifiable war hero committed
to a strong defense.
   ``He has always made us proud,'' Gramm said in remarks prepared
for delivery.
   Gramm addressed delegates to the Republican National Convention
to formally place Bush's name in nomination, just before the
traditional roll call of states that was delivering Bush his
party's mantle.
   He was being followed by several seconders, including Penn State
football coach Joe Paterno.
   Gramm combined praise for Bush, and for the accomplishments of
the Reagan administration, with a strong denunciation of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   He said Dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as
governor of Massachusetts by raising taxes, and in his second term
increased state spending and brought on Massachusetts's $400
million deficit.
   ``He taxed the poor, taxed the rich, taxed the young, taxed the
old and taxed the middle class,'' Gramm said of Dukakis. ``He taxed
businesses and he taxed families.
   ``Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that a
President Dukakis would raise our taxes?'' Gramm said.
   He said Dukakis has opposed ``every major new weapons system
that we have deployed.''
   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a president Dukakis
would cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace?'' he said.
   Gramm's senior colleague from Texas, Lloyd Bentsen, is the
Democratic vice presidential nominee. Gramm was elected to the
Senate after leaving the Democratic Party.
   Gramm referred to the legislation with which is name is
associated, the Gramm-Rudman law that set automatic
deficit-reduction targets, as ``trying to do the lord's work in the
devil's city.''
   He praised the Reagan economic record as creating 17 million new
jobs and leading an economic boom.
   ``But while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle, the
Democrats call it a disaster,'' Gramm said. ``They long for the
failed policies of the past.''
   Gramm recounted Bush's war record and credited him with coolness
when the airplane he was piloting was shot down in the Pacific
during World War II. He recounted his business experience in Texas,
Bush's adopted state, and government jobs leading up to his
election as vice president.
   ``George Bush is the greatest vice president this nation has
ever had,'' Gramm said.
   ``I am honored to place in nomination the name of a man who has
served America in war and in peace, who has the experience, the
character and the strength to lead this great land,'' he said.
   Delivering seconding speeches were Paterno; Ninfa Laurenzo of
Houston, Texas; Councilwoman Joanne M. Collins of Kansas City, Mo.;
Rep. Robert K. Dornan of California; Elaine L. Chao, chairman of
the Federal Maritime Commission; and Bush's son Jeb Bush of Miami,
and his wife.

   President Reagan said Thursday he will pass on
to his successor a program for ``the fullest possible accounting''
of servicemen still missing from the Vietnam war, acting on the
assumption that ``some of our countrymen are alive.''
   Addressing the National League of POW-MIA Families, Reagan also
called upon the government of Vietnam to move rapidly to determine
the fate of the 2,394 American servicemen still missing or
unaccounted for from the Southeast Asian conflict.
   He urged the Cambodian government to return the remains of
Americans that the Cambodians have said they are holding.
   Reagan said efforts to secure an accounting of the missing
``will continue on a priority basis'' during the less than six
months remaining in his administration.
   ``We must call upon the next administration to do the same,'' he
said. ``In preparation for transition, I am directing a
comprehensive study on the POW@MIA issue, detailing our efforts,
accomplishments, and what remains to be done to achieve the fullest
possible accounting.''
   He said the study would be made public.
   ``I implore the governments concerned to respond to our previous
proposals,'' Reagan said. ``Should there be anyone remaining
voluntarily, their family deserves to know. And every American who
has perished deserves to rest on U.S. soil. And until our questions
are fully answered, we will assume that some of our countrymen are
alive.''
   The United States lists 1,758 Americans as unaccounted for in
Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and 6 in China.
   Reagan said the government in Hanoi ``has once again raised our
hopes for a breakthrough'' by agreeing to a joint U.S.-Vietnamese
search for some of those missing in Vietnam.
   ``We have witnessed promises made in the past by Vietnam that
were not carried out, but we are following up this offer
aggressively,'' he said. ``We look forward to its fulfillment.''
   The president also took note of Vietnam's recent announcement of
plans to withdraw its forces from Cambodia.
   ``If they are serious, then it is time to move rapidly to
resolve the POW-MIA issue; for the deep pain that this issue brings
to the American people will turn against Hanoi if it lingers past a
Cambodian settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is in the interests of Hanoi to position itself for a new
era and to help bring this to pass.''
   As for Cambodia, he said, ``The government in Phnom Penh has
announced they are holding the remains of Americans but have yet to
agree to our proposals to receive them. I call upon them today to
do so.''
   As Reagan finished his speech, a woman in the audience called
out, ``Don't abandon them; please don't abandon them.''
   In the hotel lobby and outside, demonstrators wearing badges
identifying themselves as members of the ``Forget Me Not
Association,'' shouted ``Freedom Now'' and demanded stepped-up
action to find the missing.
   At the National Press Club Building, the National Steering
Committee for Vietnam War Veterans announced plans to float
Vietnamese currency down the Mekong River stamped with a $2.4
million offer for the return of any live American POW from Vietnam,
Laos or Cambodia. The reward offer has been made by several members
of the House of Representatives and others.
   Committee chairman Ted Sampley of Kinston, N.C., said the group
plans to send a delegation to Thailand in October for distribution
of stamped Vietnamese 200 and 500 ``dong'' bills. He said 20
million dong would be distributed, worth between $5,000 and $8,000.
   Relatives of missing Americans floated balloons on the Mekong
carrying the same reward offer last September after Thai officials
stopped their plans to launch the balloons into the air. U.S.
officials criticized the balloon launch plan, saying it might
hinder government efforts to gain an accounting of those missing.

   Sen. Phil Gramm, nominating George Bush for
the presidency, said Wednesday he ``has the experience, the

that opponent Michael Dukakis would ``wimp America and endanger
peace.''
   Gramm, a Texan best known for the budget-cutting plan that bears

strong defense.
   ``He has always made us proud,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm addressed delegates to the Republican National Convention,
who began a long flag-waving demonstration on the floor of the
Louisiana Superdome after he formally placed Bush's name in
nomination.
   A cascade of rainbow-colored balloons floated from the stadium's
giant domed ceiling as delegates celebrated in anticipation of the
traditional roll call of states that would deliver Bush his party's
mantle.
   Gramm was followed by several seconders, including Penn State
football coach Joe Paterno, and an unannounced seconding speech by
87-year-old actress Helen Hayes.
   ``I'm here,'' Paterno said, ``because ... I'll be damned if I'll
sit still while people who can't carry George Bush's shoes ridicule
him.''
   Gramm combined praise for Bush, and for the accomplishments of
the Reagan administration, with a strong denunciation of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   He said Dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as

   President Reagan today assured the families of
servicemen still missing from the Vietnam War that the government
must persevere in its attempt to give ``the fullest possible
accounting'' of their whereabouts.
   Addressing the National League of POW-MIA Families, Reagan
hailed an agreement in which Vietnam will allow a joint
U.S.-Vietnamese search for some 1,760 U.S. service personnel
officially listed as unaccounted-for.
   As Reagan spoke, a veterans group accused the administration of
lying about its intentions in the search for POWs and giving up on
live war prisoners still in Southeast Asia.
   The National Steering Committee for Vietnam War Veterans
announced plans to float Vietnamese currency down the Mekong River
stamped with a $2.4 million offer for the return of any live
American POW from Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. The reward offer has
been made by several members of the House of Representatives and
others.
   Committee Chairman Ted Sampley of Kinston, N.C., said the group
plans to send a delegation to Thailand in October to distribute
stamped Vietnamese bills.
   Relatives of missing Americans floated balloons on the Mekong
carrying the reward offer last September after Thai officials
stopped their plans to launch the balloons into the air. U.S.
officials criticized the balloon launch plan, saying it might
hinder government efforts to gain an accounting of those missing.
   ``As you gather for your 19th meeting, the Vietnamese government
has once again raised our hopes for a breakthrough,'' the president
told the POW-MIA families. ``I welcome their pledge to my special
emissary (retired Army Gen. John Vessey) ... to accelerate their
work on those cases.''
   ``We look forward to its fulfillment,'' Reagan said, cautioning
that ``we have witnessed promises made in the past by Vietnam that
were not carried out. But we are following this offer up
aggressively.''
   In his speech today, Reagan announced that he was directing a
``comprehensive study'' on the issue of prisoners of war and
missing in action, and that the report would detail ``our efforts,
accomplishments and what remains to be done to achieve the fullest
possible accounting.''
   ``During the remainder of our administration, these efforts will
continue on a priority basis,'' he said. ``We must call upon the
next administration to do the same.''
   ``For you, the families of MIAs and POWs unaccounted for, the
Vietnam War is not over and will not end,'' Reagan said. ``For you,
the only way we can `give peace a chance' is to give you the truth:
the fullest possible accounting of your loved ones. ...
   ``If there are living Americans being held against their will,
we must bring them home,'' he said.
   ``Should there be anyone remaining voluntarily, their family
deserves to know,'' the president said. ``And every American who
has perished deserves to rest on U.S. soil. And until our questions
are fully answered, we will assume that some of our countrymen are
alive.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says no purpose would be served by
declassifying files on Americans missing in action in the Vietnam
war, as a veterans' advocacy group is seeking.
   The National Steering Committee for American War Veterans,
chaired by Ted Sampley of Kinston, N.C., said in a letter to
President Bush, ``Use your powers as president to help us liberate
the truth. ... Mr. President, you cannot just wish that the issues
of the Vietnam War will go away.''
   Sampley said the request to Bush was partly a response to a
report from the State and Defense departments just before the Reagan
administration left office that U.S. agencies ``have yet to find
conclusive evidence of the existence of live prisoners.''
   But Army Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, chief Pentagon spokesman on
issues affecting the missing, said in response to Sampley's request,
``I don't feel a proposal like you're talking about will do anything
to enhance these ongoing efforts'' for ``the fullest accounting'' of
what happened to U.S. servicemen.
   ``It's quite obvious'' that declassification would jeopardize
intelligence sources and collection techniques, Schneider said, and
``your sources quickly begin to disappear'' when that happens.
   Information bearing on individuals in the files has been shared
with families without revealing sources and techniques, he said.
   Meanwhile, in another development, Bob Dumas of Canterbury,
Conn., speaking for the Korean War Veterans Association, said a
delegation from that group would meet North Korean officials in New
York seeking an invitation to visit North Korea for discussions on
returning the remains of U.S. soldiers killed there.
   The Pentagon still lists 2,383 Americans as missing or
unaccounted for in Southeast Asia or nearby waters. Dumas said
remains of ``probably several hundred'' Americans were in North
Korea as a result of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
   On Monday, the Vietnamese government turned over remains believed
to be those of 23 Americans killed there.
   Sampley said his group's letter was in response to the
president's inaugural address and Bush's references to a ``new
breeze blowing.''
   Sampley's group has long maintained that Americans are in
captivity in Southeast Asia. Last fall, it sponsored an incursion
into Laos by two Americans, Jim Kopp and Donna Long, to spread word
of a $2.4 million reward being offered by 21 members of Congress for
anyone who freed an American.
   The two were caught on their first day and held for 41 days
before being released.

   House Budget Committee negotiators have agreed

superconducting super collider at a site south of Dallas.
   ``The committee recognizes that the SSC represents an
extraordinary opportunity to maintain U.S. leadership in science

   The agreement, sought by committee members John Bryant of
Dallas, Marvin Leath of Waco and Dick Armey of Copper Canyon,
authorizes at least $200 million to be spent on the particle
accelerator in fiscal 1990.
   The Energy Department wants to build the 53-mile underground

Congress to spend $250 million to begin construction in fiscal 1990.
   Although the chairman of the Budget Committee, Rep. Leon

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee has recommended approval of an aerosol version of a drug
that helps prevent a life-threatening pneumonia in AIDS patients.
   The FDA is expected to agree and approve an aerosol version of
pentamidine within weeks, said an FDA source who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Aerosol pentamidine has been widely available to AIDS patients
since the FDA in February allowed expanded distribution as an
experimental medication under government review.
   However, many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs.
FDA approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for AIDS
patients using the drug.
   The advisory committee recommended approval of the drug for
preventing bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an
estimated 60 percent of AIDS deaths.
   Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable
drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis. The spray
version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the
pneumonia infection first shows up.

<NOTE>Veterans Group Appeals to Other Countries for Asylum Pledge</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An activist veterans group, which says there
still are U.S. war prisoners in Indochina, is seeking a country
that will offer asylum to anyone who brings out a living POW.
   Ted Sampley, head of the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, said Monday the organization believes it can
get an American out within six months after asylum is guaranteed.
   The group has written officials of the Australian, British,
Canadian, New Zealand, French and Swedish embassies asking that
they offer a guarantee since the United States has not.
   U.S. officials have criticized independent efforts to find POWs
in Southeast Asia, saying they jeopardize official efforts to
resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   Two members of Sampley's organization were held prisoner for 41
days in Laos last year after they entered the country to publicize
a reward of more than $2 million offered by several members of
Congress for the safe return of a prisoner of war.
   While U.S. officials say they have seen no proof that missing
soldiers remain alive in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia, they do not
rule out the possibility. About 2,400 U.S. servicemen are listed as
missing in action in Southeast Asia.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Thursday gave a U.S. military
team 38 sets of remains believed to be those of American servicemen,
a U.S. spokesman said. It was the largest such repatriation since
the Vietnam War ended.
   In a 50-minute ceremony at Hanoi airport, a U.S. military honor
guard loaded the remains, each in metal caskets draped with U.S.
flags, onto an Air Force plane, said Lt. Col. Thomas J. Boyd of the
U.S. Pacific Command.
   He said the plane took off for Honolulu, where the Army Central
Identification Laboratory will determine if the remains belong to
any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in
Vietnam.
   ``The remains are all associated with incidents in the northern
provinces. They said they were found in lots of different
circumstances and some of the remains were found by local
villagers,'' Boyd said.
   He said the Vietnamese ``presented possible names associated with
some of the remains.'' Boyd said the Vietnamese also turned over
information on 12 other missing Americans.
   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoted unidentified
Vietnamese sources as saying Vietnam will step up the search for
American MIAs and has agreed to accept more U.S. teams to conduct
searches.
   The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved
27 sets handed over April 6.
   Boyd said a four-member team of U.S. forensic experts examined 45
boxes of other remains in Hanoi and found some that they recommended
for analysis in the United States. Earlier reports had said 80 sets
of remains were examined.
   The other three teams searched Binh Tri Thien and Nghe Tinh
provinces in north-central Vietnam, looking at U.S. warplane crash
sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes, Boyd
said. Their 10-day project ended Thursday.
   Investigators focused on 70 ``discrepancy cases'' where the
United States says Vietnamese authorities should have information,
including cases of captured airmen who were never returned.
   Boyd said Vietnamese and U.S. technical experts would meet in
Hanoi on Monday to Wednesday to review work, decide on possible
repatriations and discuss future projects.
   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned remains of 172
Americans which have been identified by the Army laboratory.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA: 1,747 in Vietnam,
547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia, and six in China.
   The repatriation Thursday was the seventh since retired Gen. John
W. Vessey, acting as a special U.S. envoy, reached agreement in
August 1987 with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach to end
months of deadlock on the MIA issue.
   The first American combat troops landed in then-South Vietnam in
March 1965. The Paris Peace Accords in January 1973 halted U.S.
fighting in the conflict, which claimed the lives of about 58,000
Americans and ended in the communist victory over the U.S.-backed
South Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   Bitter political bickering between Hanoi and Washington has often
blocked accounting for the U.S. missing. The U.S. government says it
will not consider normalizing relations with Vietnam until Hanoi
withdraws all its troops from Cambodia and resolves the MIA issue.
   In Laos, U.S. and Laotian officials were continuing a joint
excavation Thursday in southern Savannakhet province to try to
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to
be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in Laos.

   Vietnam today gave a U.S. military team
38 sets of suspected remains of missing American servicemen in the
largest such repatriation since the Vietnam War ended, a U.S.
spokesman said.
   A U.S. military honor guard loaded the remains, each in metal
caskets topped with U.S. flags, onto an Air Force plane during a
solemn 50-minute ceremony at Hanoi airport, said Lt. Col. Thomas J.
Boyd of the U.S. Pacific Command.
   He said the plane took off for Honolulu, where the Army Central
Identification Laboratory will determine if the remains belong to
any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in
Vietnam.
   ``They presented possible names associated with some of the
remains,'' Boyd said. ``The remains are all associated with
incidents in the northern provinces. They said they were found in
lots of different circumstances and some of the remains were found
by local villagers.''
   Boyd said the Vietnamese also turned over information on 12 other
missing Americans.
   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoted unidentified
Vietnamese sources as saying Vietnam will step up the search for
American MIAs and has agreed to accept more U.S. teams to conduct
searches.
   The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved
27 sets handed over April 6.
   Boyd said a four-member team of U.S. forensic experts examined 45
boxes of other remains in Hanoi and found some they recommended be
analysed in the United States. Earlier reports had said 80 sets of
remains were examined.
   The other three teams searched Binh Tri Thien and Nghe Tinh
provinces in north-central Vietnam, looking at U.S. warplane crash
sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes, Boyd
said. Their 10-day project ended today.
   Investigators focus on 70 ``discrepancy cases'' where the United
States says Vietnamese authorities should have information,
including cases of captured airmen who were never returned.
   Boyd said Vietnamese and U.S. technical experts would meet in
Hanoi Monday to Wednesday to review work, decide on possible
repatriations and discuss future projects.
   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned remains of 172

   The United States and Laos began a
search Tuesday for remains of two U.S. soldiers shot down 22 years
ago on a reconnaissance mission in a remote area of Laos, a U.S.
military spokesman said.
   A 14-member U.S. military team flew from Bangkok on two C-130
transport planes to meet a group of Laotian officials at the crash
site in Savannakhet province of southern Laos, said Maj. Tim
Pfister, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   The two aircraft carried electric generators, metal detectors
and tools to excavate the site where the Mohawk OV-1A airplane
crashed.
   The joint search is the third in a U.S. effort to account for
about 2,400 Americans who did not return from the Indochina war.
The wars in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia ended in 1975 with victories
of communist forces, but some Americans lost in the early 1960s
were listed as missing in action.
   A preliminary ground search involving U.S. military experts last
week failed to locate any human remains at the site in southern
Laos.
   The American team, which includes an expert in identifying human
remains and two explosive disposal specialists, will live in tents
during the week-long search, Pfister said.
   The team is from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
the Army Central Identification Laboratory. The Honolulu-based
agencies are working to resolve the fates of Amerians missing in
action in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   The U.S. Defense Department lists 555 MIAs in Laos, mostly
pilots who went down on missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the
vital communist supply line which funneled men and material from
North Vietnam to South Vietnam.
   Pfister said the Laotian and U.S. teams hope to discover the
fates of two soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire
struck their airplane on March 15, 1966.
   Another U.S. aircraft on the same mission reported that one
crewman parachuted out but landed near where the plane crashed, 95
miles east of Savannakhet City and 25 miles west of the main
section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
   Serial numbers found on wreckage last week were confirmed by the
aircraft manufacturer, the Grumman Corp., as belonging to an OV-1A
Mohawk. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said famlies of the two crewmen
have been notified, but the names of the MIAs have not been
publicly released.
   The remains of 11 Americans were recovered in the first joint
excavation in Laos in 1985 and eight other sets of remains were
found in 1986.
   On previous excavations, the workers went down on hands and
knees, using small shovels and other hand tools to dig out plane
wreckage and fine metal screens to sift for bone fragments. A
number of unexploded shells were found, prompting the addition of
explosives experts to the new team.
   U.S. experts say chances of uncovering remains grow smaller with
the passage of time in the harsh tropical climate. They say looting
by local people also takes a toll.

<TEXT>
   The State Department welcomed today a
suggestion by Hanoi for the opening of U.S. offices in Vietnam to
gather information about Americans missing in action in the
Indochina war.
   However, Nancy Beck, a press officer, said the senior Vietnamese
official who announced the proposal had not transmitted it formally
to the U.S. government during a recent private visit to the country.
   And the U.S. official said Vietnamese government adviser Nguyen
Xuan Oanh had not met with State Department officials.
   Even so, Ms. Beck said, ``the United States is prepared to
consider any formal proposals that the Vietnamese government may
have in resolving this pressing humanitarian problem.''
   Oanh told reporters Wednesday in Bangkok, Thailand, that ``we
need to get to the bottom of this matter, and I think this is the
only way. We let this go on too long for anyone's good.''
   He said he had conveyed the proposal from Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach to the State Department and congressmen
during his recent trip to the United States and found an
``enthusiastic'' response.
   ``The ball is now in your (American) court. You play it,'' Oanh
said in response to whether the MIA offices would be opened.
   Oanh, an economic advisor to Vietnamese leader Nguyen Van Linh,
said the offices _ set up and manned by Americans _ would gather
information on the fates of U.S. servicemen still unaccounted-for
from the war. The number of offices and locations would be worked
out at a later date, he said.
   In recent months, stepped-up cooperation between Vietnam and the
United States on the MIA issue has included a joint search in
northern Vietnam and the hand-over by Hanoi Nov. 3 of 23 remains
believed to be those of American war dead.
   More than 2,300 Americans are still listed as MIAs from the wars
in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Washington has cited this issue and
the Vietnamese military presence in Cambodia as key impediments to
normalized relations between the onetime foes.
   Hoping to broaden its international contacts and shore up its
devastated economy, Hanoi has been seeking diplomatic ties and the
lifting of a U.S. trade embargo.

   A decrepit Soviet truck
lurches down the highway to Vietnam bearing clay-grimed wreckage of
a U.S. aircraft.
   The export of war scrap is an everyday scene in eastern Laos,
bringing cash to impoverished villagers. But widespread scavenging
of aircraft crash sites is hindering U.S. efforts to account for
Americans missing from the Indochina War.
   U.S. planes flew hundreds of thousands of bombing sorties
against Communist targets in Laos between 1965 and 1973 and some
never made it back to home base.
   Their crews make up most of the 533 U.S. servicemen still listed
as missing in action in the country.
   The United States began ground searches for the MIAs in 1983,
and Washington recently has issued upbeat statements telling of
improving cooperation with the Laotian government.
   But progress remains slow, partly because of the difficulty in
coordinating searches with understaffed Laotian ministries. So far,
just 36 sets of remains have been identified and repatriated.
   Vital evidence that would help identify crash sites is being
carted away for sale. And its not just aircraft scrap _ but human
remains, too.
   Still, Washington have faced fewer problems cooperating with the
government in Laos, the only Indochinese country with which it has
diplomatic relations, than in Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The first six sets of suspected MIA remains were returned from
Cambodia last week. A total of 1,678 Americans are missing in
Vietnam, 83 in Cambodia while six are missing over China's coastal
waters.
   In 1987, a group of private U.S. citizens and Republican
congressmen began distributing leaflets in Laos offering a $2.4
million reward for the return of any live American prisoner.
   The offer has done irreparable harm to search efforts, U.S.
officials say.
   They say they have been swamped by sightings of live ``missing''
Americans, mostly by Laotian refugees who want to resettle abroad.
More than 17,000 interviews have not yielded a single credible case.
   ``People figure that if someone is offering so much money for a
live American they are also willing to pay for bones,'' a U.S.
official said.
   Even though U.S. policy does not sanction financial rewards for
MIA remains, a slick cottage industry has grown up turning out
bones and bogus dog tag military identifications. These are offered
to U.S. searchers through middlemen in neighboring Thailand.
   ``Some people were even willing to dig up their mother's
grave,'' said one American expert who did not want to be identified.
   A genuine American skeleton might be split up into several sets
of remains in the hope of more rewards, and that reduces the
chances of identifying the remains, a U.S. official said.
   Provincial officials say they are willing to support fully U.S.
efforts to find their missing. But even they admit there is a
tradeoff.
   ``Many planes came down here. People know where they are,'' said
Lahoun Maprayvong, an district official in the heavily-bombed
southeastern province of Savannakhet.
   Washington must do more to rebuild what the bombing destroyed,
he said.
   ``It is according to the agreement. If they want to know where
the bones are, the local people need help,'' he said. ``We need
hospitals and schools.'' The United States gives some assistance to
the Laotian government in return for MIA cooperation. But in June,
Richard Solomon, Secretary of State for Asian affairs, admitted
that Washington had ``been unable to address (Laotians')
humanitarian concerns in a meaningful way.''
   Lahoun says some villagers are unwilling to reveal crash sites.
He says it's because they have bad memories of the bombing. But
there's money to be made from the gleaning of U.S. crash sites _
and that can make a difference in rural areas where annual per
capita income is below $170.
   Villagers and traders have systematically stripped many crash
sites of anything of value. This includes many key aircraft parts
bearing serial numbers that would help identify its crew.
   Aircraft aluminum is recycled into buckets, cooking pots,
spoons, traditional jewelry, even river canoes.
   Traders say the top-quality metal fetches high prices abroad. It
is trucked to Vietnam and Thailand, with some sent on to Japan and
beyond.
   But the trade is slowing down. One by one, crash sites are
denuded. Some sites have only a few fragments of metal and bone
left. Only in the most remote regions are there undisturbed sites,
U.S. officials say.
   They hope easing Cold War tensions and gradually improving
relations with communist Indochina will improve access and allow
more widespread searches.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Flies To Retrieve Largest MIA Remains Turnover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team flew to Vietnam
Thursday to receive 38 sets of remains believed to be those of
missing Americans in the largest such turnover since the Vietnam War
ended.
   During the repatriation ceremony scheduled Thursday at Hanoi's
Noi Bai Airport, the Vietnamese also were to turn over information
on 12 other cases of Americans listed as missing in action, or MIAs,
said Lt. Col. Thomas J. Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific
Command.
   At the ceremony, a U.S. military honor guard will solemnly load
the remains, each in metal caskets topped with a folded American
flag, onto a U.S. Air Force plane for the flight to Guam and then
Honolulu. In Honolulu, the Army Central Identification Laboratory
will analyze the remains to determine if they belong to any of the
1,747 MIAs still listed from the Vietnam war.
   Vietnamese officials usually do preliminary analyses, but the
army laboratory sometimes finds among the remains those of
Vietnamese individuals.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by Vietnam
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing
cooperation to resolve this long-standing issue,'' Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said in Washington on Wednesday.
   The Pentagon said it had not received any information from
Vietnam on precisely where the latest remains to be exchanged had
been recovered or the circumstances surrounding their discovery.
   Schneider added, however, that ``we understand the remains as
well as the information are related to incidents that occurred
(during the war) in the northern provinces.''
   Most missing Americans in the north were airmen shot down on
bombing or reconnaissance missions.
   All told, the remains of 172 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
Army laboratory since the end of the war.
   The previous largest turnover of remains believed to be those of
MIAs involved 27 sets handed over April 6. The most recent turnover
involved 23 sets repatriated Nov. 3.
   Thursday's repatriation will be the seventh since retired Gen.
John W. Vessey, acting as a special U.S. presidential envoy, reached
agreement with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach to end
months of deadlock on the MIA issue. In all, 138 sets of remains
have been returned since the August 1987 agreement in Hanoi.
   The first American combat troops in Vietnam landed in Danang,
then in South Vietnam, in March 1965. The Paris Peace Accords in
January 1973 halted U.S. fighting in the conflict, which killed
about 58,000 Americans and ended in the communist victory over the
U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   Bitter political bickering between Hanoi and Washington has often
blocked accounting for the U.S. missing since then. The U.S.
government says it will not consider normalizing relations with
Vietnam until Hanoi withdraws all its troops from Cambodia and
resolves the MIA issue.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA as a result of the
war: 1,747 are missing in Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia, and
six in China.
   In Laos, U.S. and Laotian officials were continuing Thursday a
joint excavation in southern Savannakhet province to try to
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to
be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in Laos.

   Authorities today ordered two Americans
who had illegally crossed into Laos on a search for U.S. prisoners
of war to remain in Thailand pending an investigation of their
status.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both from North Carolina, returned to
Bangkok on Saturday after 41 days of detention in a Laotian jail.
The Laotian authorities detained them after they sailed across the
Mekong River from Thailand to illegally enter Laos.
   Once in Laos, they passed out offers of a $2.4 million reward for
Americans they believe are still being held more than 13 years after
the Indochina war ended.
   When they returned to Bangkok, immigration officials at the
airport let them through but kept their passports because they did
not bear the stamp given when travelers leave Thailand, said Capt.
Apisak Phumsvi of Immigration Police.
   That delayed the Americans' original plans to leave for the
United States Wednesday.
   Apisak said immigration commander Maj. Gen. Kriangkrai Karnasuta
must approve the Americans' request that the charges of an
immigration violation be waived. The process normally takes up to
three days, he said.
   ``Their case is not a serious violation of Thai immigration
rules,'' Apisak said. ``We are looking at it as if it were
unintentional.''
   Miss Long is a 45-year-old writer from Jacksonville, N.C., and
Copp is a 44-year-old schoolteacher from Hampstead, N.C. They said
they were not physically mistreated in Laos, but were subjected to
interrogations and spent 32 days in solitary confinement.
   They were released after $1,500 in administrative costs was paid
to the Laotian government and a veterans group canceled a protest
planned at the Laotian Embassy in Washington to demand their release.
   Miss Long said a police colonel told her that if any other
Americans dared enter Laos illegally again, they would be held
``forever, forever.''
   The reward the two Americans were trying to publicize was pledged
by 21 U.S. Congressmen and some private citizens.
   Laos has repeatedly denied it is holding any Americans from the
war.
   The State Department on Monday praised the release of Miss Long
and Copp. But its spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said: ``We reiterate
our conviction that government-to-government cooperation is the way
to resolve the the POW-MIA (prisoner of war - missing in action)
issue ... and that reward offers are counterproductive to this
ongoing effort.
   There are 547 Americans listed as MIA in Laos.

   U.S. military experts returned today
from surveying an area in Laos where U.S. planes crashed during the
Indochina War and said their findings will be used to plan upcoming
site excavations.
   The United States, with help from the communist Laotian
government, is attempting to resolve the cases of 547 Americans
listed as missing in action, or MIA, in that Southeast Asian nation.
   Maj. Thomas J. Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command,
said eight technical experts carried out surveys in the Sepone area
of eastern Laos on Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``Findings from these activities will be evaluated in Washington
and (the Laotian capital of) Vientiane and be used to plan upcoming
excavations,'' a prepared statement read by Boyd said. He declined
to elaborate on the findings.
   ``We appreciate the fine cooperation the team has received and
look forward to increased joint activity with the Laos government
to resolve this important issue,'' the statement said.
   A similar U.S.-Vietnamese team is carrying out a 10-day field
investigation in Northern Vietnam, where 1,757 Americans are still
listed as MIA.
   The joint team is searching Vinh Phu and Lang Son provinces
north of Hanoi, collecting eyewitness account and other evidence of
what happened to seven U.S. servicemen lost in plane crashes during
the Vietnam war.
   The U.S. government also continues to investigate the
possibility that some Americans may still be alive in Indochina.
Vietnam and Laos have denied this, and Hanoi has often accused some
American congressmen and others of ``bad will'' for continuing to
accuse Hanoi of holding American captives.
   The American teams in Laos and Vietnam are from the Hawaii-based
U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and Army Central
Identification Laboratory.
   Before the team departed for Laos, Boyd said it would look at
crash sites and determine what kind of aircraft went down and how
they crashed.
   Losses in the Sepone area included airmen downed in missions to
cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail, used by communist North Vietnam to
infiltrate troops into U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
   The United States and Laos have now conducted four joint crash
site excavations or surveys.

  [Text] Vietnamese and American experts on Tuesday
concluded their latest search for MIA's during the Vietnam War.
A spokesman for the American military delegation in Hanoi said
the joint American-Vietnamese team working in central and north
Vietnam had discovered a crashed plane and several sets of
remains during their one-month search. American war veterans
have started seeking measures to help Vietnam in the search for
300,000 Vietnamese soldiers who were reported missing during the
war.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle laid a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknowns, two Soviet veterans paid their respects at
the Vietnam memorial and thousands of people flocked to the capital
to honor America's war dead.
   Almost perfect weather with clear blue skies, temperatures in
the 80s and a gentle breeze served as backdrop to the 120th
Memorial Day services at Arlington National Cemetery, where 200,000
veterans are buried _ each tombstone marked by an American flag for
the holiday.
   On a smaller scale, eight wreaths at the Vietnam memorial
honored the women who died in that conflict.
   In brief, somber ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknowns, Quayle
placed the wreath of flowers before the four graves _ each
representing unidentified casualties from World War I, World War
II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.
   The observance began with a 19-gun artillery salute. A drummer
from the U.S. Army Band sounded four muffled ruffles, followed by a
bugler blowing taps and then 30 seconds of silence.
   Addressing more than 5,000 people, many in shorts and T-shirts,
Quayle called the war dead ``our nation's true heroes, the solid
pillars upon which our freedom rests.''
   The national cemetery is the resting place for ``Americans for
whom the words duty, honor and country are not just a phrase. They
were a way of life,'' said Quayle, whose military record became the
subject of controversy last year because he had avoided serving in
the Vietnam War by joining the Indiana National Guard in the late
1960s.
   Across the Potomac River in the shadows of the Lincoln Memorial,
several thousand Vietnam veterans mingled and talked about
America's most recent war. Some have made the trip to the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial each Memorial Day since the monument, a
chevron-shaped wall with the names of 58,156 war dead and missing
in action etched in its black granite, was dedicated in 1982.
   The monument, which has become the most popular in Washington,
attracts more than 3.6 million visitors a year, according to the
National Park Service.
   This Memorial Day, the ceremony was aimed at honoring the women
who died in Vietnam. Eight wreaths were placed at locations where
the names of eight women, casualties of the war, are etched into
the wall.
   Veterans who were influential in getting the monument built,
reminded the audience that most Vietnam veterans returned from the
war zone to a country that was at best indifferent and at times
hostile.
   ``Our nation can never again abandon our soldiers,'' declared
Ronald Gibbs, a member of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund board
of directors. ``If we must send our youth off to battle, let's
stand by them to the end with moral conviction and support.''
   Among the thousands of visitors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
on Monday were a Soviet general who fought in World War II and a
veteran of the Soviet fighting in Afghanistan.
   Lt. Gen. Vladamir Orlov, chief of a World War II veterans group
in the Soviet Union, and Mikhail Vishnyakov, a veteran of the
fighting in Afghanistan, marveled at the impact of the Vietnam
memorial.
   The two even traced some of the names, according to John
Wheeler, a Vietnam veteran who helped arrange the visit.
   The Soviet Union's military struggle in Afghanistan, from which
the country was forced to withdraw after years of fighting, has
been compared to the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
   The Soviet Union provided supplies and weapons to the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.

   The Moscow summit could mean improved chances
for lasting peace and that is one of the best ways to remember
America's war dead, Veterans Affairs administrator Thomas Turnage
said Monday at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Turnage was the key speaker at the Memorial Day ceremony at the
Tomb of the Unknowns, which contains remains of unidentified
soldiers killed in each of the four major American wars of this
century.
   ``Those of us who live peace can take comfort in the fact'' that
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``are at
this very moment talking, search for peace,'' Turnage told about
4,000 people who attended the ceremony, which was held with full
military honors.
   ``President Reagan has kept his promise to strengthen our
defenses and enhance the prospects for peace,'' Turnage said.
``There's been a turnaround of unprecedented magnitude.''
   Turnage, who was appointed by Reagan, praised the president for
pursuing a policy toward the Soviet Union which he said has been
``realistic, consistent, and comprehensive.''
   Turnage decried what he said are calls to reduce military
spending and said the nation ``should heed such voices with
caution.''
   A mile east, across the Potomac River, U.S. Park Police
estimated that about 15,000 peoples gathered on the Mall to honor
the dead of the nation's most recent conflict, the Vietnam war.
   John Wheeler, chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
Foundation, said 30 million people visited the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial since it opened six years ago. It has become one of the
most popular destinations in Washington.
   Former Sen. Charles McC. Mathias, R-Md., urged his audience to
remember that ``every name on the wall is not just a name. Every
name represents a person, every name has a story, a personality.''
   Laura Palmer, author of ``Shrapnel in the Heart,'' said writing
the book taught her that ``now we need to turn to the families and
friends of those who died in Vietnam and say the same thing _
`welcome home.'''
   Her book is based on some of the thousands of notes and letters
relatives of the dead have stuck in cracks on the shiny black
granite wall which carries the name of the 58,000 men and women who
died in Vietnam.

   Laos and the United States held a
``cordial'' two-day meeting on the fate of 547 Americans still
listed as missing in action in Laos, a U.S. Embassy official said
Saturday.
   Harriet Isom, charge d'affaires of the American Embassy in Laos,
declined to disclose details in a telephone interview from Bangkok.
   The meeting ended Friday, she said.
   Earlier, Laos state radio said the two sides would discuss their
first annual plan to resolve the MIA issue and the provision of U.S.
humanitarian aid to the Southeast Asian nation.
   The United States over the past two years has provided more food
and medical aid to Laos, and the Vientiane government has
significantly increased cooperation in searching for the missing,
allowing several joint searches of wartime crash sites.
   Those efforts were criticized Friday by former North Carolina
Rep. William M. Hendon, who said ``everything the government has
tried has not for one reason or another succeeded'' in bringing out
American prisoners he believes still are alive in Indochina. A total
of 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA from wars in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia.
   Hendon, of McLean, Va., is traveling this weekend to Thailand's
Mekong River boundary with Laos to continue publicizing a $2.5
million reward offered by 21 congressmen to any Indochinese who
returns a POW to American custody.
   ``The word is getting in there. We are doing our best to find an
honorable solution to a very difficult situation,'' he told
reporters.
   ``Tons of intelligence'' indicated that live Americans still are
held in Indochina, but excavating crash sites was not the way to go
about extricating them, said Hendon, who heads the private POW
Publicity Fund.
   Hendon said the United States was ``very close'' in 1983 to
getting POWs back, following a mission authorized by the White House
during which he helped bring $225,000 worth of medicine to Laos in
exchange for live Americans.
   The mission failed, Hendon claimed, because public exposures of
clandestine activities in Iran and Central America forced the
administration to abort such dealings around the world. The U.S.
government has criticized private groups' illegal forays into Laos
in search of POWs.
   Before the talks, the U.S. Defense Department said the meetings
would involve scheduling surveys and excavations following a January
agreement to establish ``a year-round POW-MIA work plan.''
   Ms. Isom led the American delegation, which included technical
experts from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the U.S.
Army Central Identification Laboratory.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 17 Sets of MIAs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Wednesday returned to the
United States what are believed to be remains of 17 American
servicemen missing in action in the Vietnam War, a U.S. official
said.
   The Vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other
missing Americans, said Lt. Col. Paul Mather, leader of a U.S.
military team that received the remains in a ceremony at Hanoi's
Noi Bai Airport.
   The return was the largest in two years and the fourth largest
since the war ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government.
   The largest return was in August 1985, when 26 sets of remains
were returned.
   Mather said some of the remains received Wednesday involved
cases of highest priority to the United States.
   Mather said a U.S. honor guard saluted under chilly, overcast
skies as the metal caskets of remains, each draped with a folded
American flag, were loaded onto a C-141 transport plane for the
flight to Hawaii. The names attached to the remains were not
released.
   They will be analyzed there by the Army Central Identification
Laboratory to see if they belong to any of the nearly 1,800
Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   Mather said some of the names that the Vietnamese provided,
along with the remains and written reports, are among a list of 70
that the United States considers of highest priority.
   Retired Gen. John W. Vessey, acting as a U.S. presidential
emissary, handed over the list of names during a mission to Hanoi
in August.
   The United States says that in these ``discrepancy cases,''
there is compelling evidence that Vietnamese authorities at some
level know what happened to the missing men. Evidence includes
photographs of captured Americans who never emerged from prisoner
of war camps.
   Mather said the remains were mostly of airmen. Most missing
airmen were shot down during bombing missions in North Vietnam.
   The Vietnamese told Mather they would start the next round of
``technical talks'' on MIAs on March 12. During these talks, which
Hanoi has agreed to hold six times annually, experts of both sides
discuss ways of retreiving remains, locating warplane crash sites
and related issues.
   Wednesday's turnover was the third since Hanoi agreed during
Vessey's visit to break a deadlock and resume efforts to account
for American MIAs.
   The United States pledged then to look into Vietnam's own
humanitarian problems. An official U.S. medical team flew to Hanoi
on Wednesday to continue that mission, said the spokesman of the
U.S. embassy in Bangkok, Ross Petzing.
   Three previous medical teams have studied the plight of disabled
war veterans and other humanitarian cases and made recommendations
on how private U.S. charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation
programs.
   Washington has encouraged private assistance but refused
Vietnamese requests for direct U.S. government aid. The United
States has withheld diplomatic recognition and official aid to
protest Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia.

<HEAD>U.S. Team to Repatriate Six Sets of Remains from Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials said
Wednesday they are returning to the United States with six sets of
human remains collected by Cambodians that are believed to be of
American MIAs from the Vietnam War.
   It marks the first time since the end of the war in 1975 that
Communist Cambodia has allowed the repatriation of suspected
remains of Americans missing in action.
   A 14-member U.S. repatriation team was scheduled to arrive in
Phnom Penh early Thursday by an Air Force C-141 cargo plane.
   A military honors ceremony was planned for Thursday at the Phnom
Penh airport, and immediately afterward, the remains will be flown
to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, agencies that account for
America's wartime missing.
   Since Tuesday, a six U.S. military experts have been in Phnom
Penh to examine sets of remains collected by Cambodians in recent
years _ the first such MIA mission to Cambodia since the 1975
Communist takeover.
   ``We came and did our work and the cooperation was everything we
asked for,'' Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, the U.S. team leader, told
reporters after meeting with Dith Munty, first deputy foreign
minister of the Vietnamese-backed government.
   Eighty-three Americans are listed as missing in action in
Cambodia from the war. A military spokesman earlier said 82 were
missing in Cambodia, but later raised the number to 83. The
confusion apparently concerned an aircraft that crashed near the
Cambodian border, leaving a GI missing.
   At least eight American civilians are also listed as missing in
Cambodia, according to U.S. officials.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. team examined 28 sets of
remains in a tiny laboratory at Cambodia's only medical college.
The teak caskets contained bones, skulls and at least two sets of
military identification ``dog tags.''
   A Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government paid
$2,000 for the return of some remains from remote provinces.
   Harvey said six sets of remains warranted further analysis at
the military laboratories in Hawaii to reach a positive
identification.
   Four were found in outlying provinces and two were from an area
southwest of Phnom Penh known as Choeung Ek, which was used as a
mass execution ground by the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge when
they ruled the country from 1975 to 1978. The Khmer Rouge were
ousted after Vietnamese forces invaded the country in late 1978.
   However, it was unclear if the remains found in Choeung Ek dated
from the period when the Khmer Rouge held power.
   The U.S. mission broke a long political stalemate between
Washington and successive Communist governments in Phnom Penh over
the MIA issue.
   Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd, a team spokesman, said past U.S. efforts
to examine remains in Cambodia had been ``either ignored or
politicized.''
   He said Washington would consider sending another such team to
examine more remains, but added that this was not discussed during
his group's visit to Phnom Penh.
   The United States does not recognize the Phnom Penh government.
But a week ago, Washington announced it was withdrawing recognition
of the Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla coalition that is fighting
the Phnom Penh government, and would open talks with Vietnam on
ending the Cambodian civil war.
   Cambodia's Deputy Interior Minister Khim Ponn, head of a newly
formed MIA commission, said he wanted to discuss normalization of
diplomatic relations, but the Americans limited talks to the issue
of missing Americans.
   Most of the Americans missing in Cambodia are airmen whose
planes were downed during bombing raids from 1969 to 1973 on the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, the major supply route for the North Vietnamese
into South Vietnam that wound through the mountains of eastern
Cambodia.
   A total of 2,299 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action in Indochina. Aside from those in Cambodia, 1,678 are
missing in Vietnam, 533 in Laos and six in China's coastal waters.

   A team of Laotian and U.S. experts will
excavate a U.S. warplane crash site next month to search for remains
of missing American servicemen, a U.S. official said today.
   The search will take place Dec. 10 in Nong district of the
central Laotian province of Savannakhet, the official Laotian news
agency KPL said Tuesday. It gave no more details on the crash site.
   The report, seen in Bangkok today, quoted a news release from
Laos' Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   It would be the fourth joint excavation in the communist nation
and the second this year. The U.S. official, who requested
anonymity, said Laos has pledged to conduct three joint excavations
this year.
   In May, U.S. and Laotian soldiers searched a remote hillside in
Savannakhet but failed to find the remains of two fliers missing
after their plane was shot down in 1966.
   The United States is seeking to account for 2,387 American
servicemen and civilians missing in action, or MIA, from the war in
Vietnam, which also spilled over into neighboring Laos and Cambodia.
Most of those unaccounted for are airmen who crashed.
   The war that cost 58,000 American lives ended with communist
victories in all three countries in 1975.
   Officials have made good progress on the MIA issue this year.
   On Nov. 3, Vietnam returned what it believes to be the remains of
23 Americans. That brought to 100 the number of suspected remains
Vietnam has repatriated since agreeing in August 1987 to hasten
cooperation on the issue.
   Also this month, U.S.-Vietnamese teams completed the second joint
field investigations in the countryside to find out the fates of
American airmen shot down over northern Vietnam.
   The teams found no remains, but an informed source said today
that they retrieved some personal effects that may have belonged to
missing Americans, including a helmet that villagers had been using
to grind rice.
   He said the teams surveyed a crash site and otherwise
investigated a few cases in mountainous areas of Ha Son Binh, Hai
Hung and Son La provinces near the national capital of Hanoi.
   They interviewed villagers with information about the missing
men, but the source said the sites must be excavated before the
cases could be resolved.

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials will meet next
week in Hanoi to discuss joint efforts to search for Americans
missing from the war, administration spokesmen said Thursday. And
they released the names of four servicemen whose remains were
returned by the Vietnamese this year.
   U.S. officials also welcomed a statement by the Vietnamese
foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, that he would try to resolve by
the end of year 70 so-called discrepancy cases, among them,
Americans believed to have been captured by the Vietnamese.
   The Vietnamese offers come amid increasing signs that communist
authorities in that Southeast Asian nation wish to improve
relations with the West. The biggest step has been withdrawal of
some Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.
   ``We are pleased to confirm that Vietnam has offered to work
jointly with the United States on concerted efforts to resolve the
issue of American military and civilian personnel still missing and
unaccounted for from the Vietnam war,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley. A Pentagon spokesman read an identical
statement.
   The Vietnamese offer stemmed from a meeting in New York on June
8 between Gen. John Vessey, a presidential envoy, and the
Vietnamese foreign minister ``to discuss accelerated cooperation on
humanitarian issues of concern,'' she said.
   Last August, Vessey gave the Vietnamese a list of 200
discrepancy cases, describing 70 of them as ``compelling'' and
warranting urgent action.
   Vessey, asked by President Reagan to handle unresolved
prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action issues from the Vietnam War,
has defined discrepancy cases as those ``for whom there was strong
evidence that they survived their incident and were captured or
otherwise came under Vietnamese control, or about whom the
Vietnamese authorities should have information.''
   The U.S. statement said ``we have long urged Vietnam to agree to
joint activities, such as field investigations, surveys and
excavations, to expedite the resolution of the POW-MIA issue.''
   ``The Vietnamese offer is an encouraging development that will
facilitate this objective, and we look forward to greatly expanded
cooperation in the coming months,'' it said. ``The two governments
have agreed to hold planning meetings in Hanoi July 25-28 to
discuss technical aspects of implementing this offer.''
   The head of the U.S. delegation heading to Hanoi will be Lt.
Col. Joe Harvey, the commanding officer of the Joint Casualty
Resolution Center, the statement said.
   At the same time, the Pentagon released the names of four
servicemen whose remains were returned or recovered earlier.
   Their names, hometowns, dates of birth, and loss dates were:
   _Air Force Maj. Joseph J. Karins, Jr., of Syracuse, N.Y., born
April 21, 1938, lost over North Vietnam, March 11, 1967;

born Nov. 25, 1951, lost in Laos, March 29, 1972.
   The Pentagon announcement said the remains of three of the
servicemen would leave Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, at 8 a.m. on
Monday, July 25, en route for Travis Air Force Base, Calif., ``for
their final journey home.''
   In July 1985, Vietnam announced its intention to help resolve
the issue of American POWs and MIAs within two years, and since
then has returned the remains of many Americans lost in Indochina.
   The Vietnamese allowed U.S. representatives to take part in the
joint excavation of one crash site, in November 1985, but no
remains were recovered.
   The United States is trying to account for nearly 1,800
Americans missing in action from the Vietnam war, which ended in
April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government. U.S. forces lost 58,000 soldiers during the
war.

   Vietnam War veterans plan to spend more than a
month in a bamboo cage to draw public attention to U.S. soldiers
still reported missing in action in southeast Asia.
   The group began its 37-day vigil adjacent to the city's
lakefront War Memorial Center on Thursday. The vigil is to end
Sept. 15, designated National POW-MIA Day.
   Forty-eight members of Wisconsin Vietnam Veterans Chapter One
are to take turns around the clock in the cage for 37 days, said
Gary Wetzel, a Congressional Medal of Honor recipient who spoke
Friday from inside the cage covered with barbed wire.
   The cage, 5 feet long, 5 feet wide and 3{ feet tall, is about
the size of the cages in which several prisoners of war were held
during the Vietnam War, Wetzel said.
   Participants are allowed to leave the cage to go the bathroom,
and all have agreed to try to reduce their food-intake as a
symbolic sacrifice.
   Organizers said the length of the vigil was selected to honor
the 37 Wisconsin soldiers still listed as missing in action during
the Vietnam War.
   The cage is set up alongside a reflecting pool at the center,
where the names of Milwaukee's war dead are listed. Those who visit
the location are urged to write their congressmen, senators and the
president to account for Americans missing in the war, Wetzel, 41,
said.
   ``When the day comes that one American is not worth the time and
the effort to be found, we, as Americans, have lost,'' Wetzel said,
adding that more than 2,300 Americans still have not been accounted
for in southeast Asia.
