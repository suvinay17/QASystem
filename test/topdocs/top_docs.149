   NILES, Ohio -- RMI Titanium Co. has seen early signs of an
upturn in orders for delivery in the 1992 first quarter, but
the company expects at least two more quarters of losses, L.
Frederick Gieg Jr., president and chief executive officer,
said.
   Low shipments and weak titanium prices will produce a loss
for the current quarter larger than the second quarter's $3.3
million deficit, Mr. Gieg said in an interview. The company
also will show a loss for the fourth quarter, he said, but
it's too early to say whether the final period's loss will
equal the second quarter's.

   Meanwhile, RMI is attempting to counter a long-term
decline in military demand for titanium by finding new uses
for the light, strong and corrosion-resistant metal.
Currently, 75% to 80% of titanium products are sold to
aerospace concerns. By the middle of this decade, RMI wants
to obtain half its sales from other markets, Mr. Gieg said.
Among the most promising possibilities, he said, are
increased sales to the energy industry.
   In addition, RMI is studying ways to improve its
facilities for producing the raw metal, Mr. Gieg said. That
effort will require a major investment, he added, but it may
be made as a joint venture with another titanium concern,
possibly a foreign company. Mr. Gieg declined to identify
companies it is talking with concerning such a possible joint
venture.
   RMI had a second-quarter loss equal to 23 cents a share,
in contrast to net income of $8.3 million, or 54 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell 36% to $44.3 million from
$68.9 million. For the first half, RMI had a loss of $3.3
million, or 23 cents a share, on sales of $92.5 million,
compared with year-earlier net income of $17.5 million, or
$1.11 a share, on sales of $137 million.
   Sales for the year are likely to fall below $200 million,
Mr. Geig said, from $255.3 million in 1990. For all of 1990,
the company earned $27.3 million, or $1.82 a share.
   Until April 1990, RMI was a partnership of USX Corp. and
Quantum Chemical Corp. Quantum sold its shares through a
public offering April 20, 1990. USX retained its shares,
which currently account for about 52% of the total
outstanding because of stock buy-backs by RMI.
   RMI will approximately break even on a cash flow basis
this year, Mr. Gieg said. Results for the fourth quarter will
determine whether the company has a slightly positive or
negative cash flow, he said.
   Directors will "take a good hard look" at the dividend at
their October meeting, when the next payment will be
considered, he said. The company has paid a quarterly
dividend of 2.5 cents a share since the public offering, he
said, but directors will have to decide whether business
prospects and cash requirements will permit continued
payments at that rate.
   RMI Titanium's orders began weakening in early 1990, Mr.
Gieg said, mainly because of lower defense purchases. The
order slowdown was compounded by the recession that began a
year ago and by related problems in commercial aviation. The
aircraft industry uses titanium in jet engines and for many
body parts.
   Military aircraft will be a shrinking market for some
years, he said, as defense spending is reduced because of the
end of the Cold War. However, the commercial airplane market,
which already consumes 50% more titanium than military
aircraft, will resume its growth once lingering effects of
the recession are over and certain airlines resolve their
financial problems, Mr. Gieg said.
   The pulp and paper industry, chemical process plants and
other industrial users are consuming less titanium this year
because expansion projects have been deferred or curtailed,
he said.
   User inventories quickly became too large as consumption
dropped off, he said. Orders fell and prices weakened.
   As a result, RMI expects to ship 11 million to 13 million
pounds of titanium mill products this year, Mr. Gieg said,
down from 16 million pounds in 1990. Sales of titanium
sponge, a raw form of the metal that RMI sells to
nonintegrated titanium concerns, will drop to one million to
1.5 million pounds, from four million to five million pounds
in recent years.

   The Air Force is
spending $90 million to rebuild a launch pad for its new Titan 4
rockets, which will take secret military payloads into space, an
official said.
   Space Launch Complex-4 East has been used for Titan 34D launches
since 1982 and was rebuilt after one exploded in April 1986.
   The Titan 4 will carry payloads previously intended for the space
shuttle. Vandenberg's shuttle pad was dismantled in the aftermath of
the Challenger disaster.
   The 1986 explosion of the Titan 34D destroyed what was reportedly
a spy satellite and put the launch pad and one close by out of
commission for more than a year.
   The Air Force spent $50 million to rebuild the two pads so it
could continue launching the Titan 34Ds, said Col. John E. Angell,
who is in charge of Air Force space launches from Vandenberg.
   The launch pads were further rebuilt to handle the Titan 4
launches, he said.
   The first Titan 4 launched at Vandenberg likely will carry a $1
billion KH-12 spy satellite, said John Pike, a space policy expert
with the Federation of American Scientists.
   The reconnaissance satellite is capable of taking sharp
photographs of the Earth's surface through clouds, he said.

   The Air Force's last Titan 3 rocket
blasted off with a secret military satellite Monday, ending a
quarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled
more than 200 satellites into space.
   The 16-story-tall rocket, the powerful 34D model, brilliantly
illuminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at
1:54 a.m.
   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for
the Titan 3 family, a success rate of 96 percent.
   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to another
generation of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.
Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command.
   Officials said Monday's payload was secret. Sources who spoke on
condition on anonymity said the rocket may have carried a
reconnaissance satellite.
   Many of the satellites carried by Titan 3 rockets have been
cloaked in secrecy since the first was launched here in 1964.
   The payloads, most of them built for the Pentagon, have performed
a number of strategic assignments, including photo reconnaissance,
communications, navigation, monitoring missile tests, intercepting
military and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet compliance with
arms treaties and establishing an orbiting system to provide instant
alert of a missile attack.
   Titan 3 rockets also launched two Viking spacecraft toward Mars
in 1976 and sent the Voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1977 toward the solar
system's outer reaches.
   Voyager 2 two weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune
and its moon Triton as it completed a grand tour that also included
a closeup look at Uranus.
   The Titan 34D can boost 31,650-pound payloads into low orbit,
about 150 miles up, or 4,200 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles
out.
   The Air Force is replacing it with the larger Titan 4, the first
of which boosted a missile warning satellite into orbit on June 14.
The new rocket can hoist 39,000 pounds to low orbit or 10,000 pounds
to stationary orbit.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a contract to build 23
Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion and is negotiating for
an additional 26 rockets.
   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Force
from the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, which
earlier had been modified to boost into orbit the two-man Gemini
capsule in the mid-1960s.
   The booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34D series,
each more powerful than the last.
   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalleled success
record,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.
   ``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the
Air Force's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect the
Titan 4 to continue that tradition.''

   The last Air Force Titan 3 rocket
roared into space with a secret Pentagon satellite today, ending 25
years of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled more than
200 satellites into space.
   The 16-story-tall rocket, a 34D model, blazed away from its
launch pad at 1:54 a.m., brilliantly illuminating the darkness as it
rumbled skyward.
   ``The vehicle is right on track,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Ron
Rand, the launch commentator.
   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for
the Titan 3.
   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to another
generation of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.
Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command. ``I'd like to
thank the entire Air Force and industry team for dedicated and
dependable service.''
   Officials provided no information on today's payload, saying only
that it was classified. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said the rocket may have carried an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   A secrecy label has been placed on many of the satellites carried
by Titan 3 rockets since the first was launched here in 1964.
   The payloads, most built for the Defense Department, have
performed many strategic military assignments. Among them were photo
reconnaissance, communications, monitoring missile tests,
intercepting military and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet
compliance with arms control treaties and establishing an orbiting
system to provide instant alert of a hostile missile attack.
   The Titan 3s also have had some notable non-classified launches,
including two Viking spacecraft boosted toward landings on Mars in
1976 and the Voyager 1 and 2 probes dispatched in 1977 toward the
outer planets.
   Voyager 1 and 2 probed Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 two
weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune and its moon
Triton as it completed a grand tour that included closeup looks at
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The Titan 34D launched today was the 15th for that model, which
is the most powerful in the Titan 3 series. It can boost
31,650-pound payloads into low Earth orbit or 4,200 pounds to
stationary orbit 22,300 miles out.
   The Air Force is replacing the Titan 34D with the more powerful

Gets Titan Work
For $1.56 Billion

   The Air Force awarded Martin Marietta Corp. a $1.56 billion contract for a new generation of Titan launch vehicles to lift a variety of military payloads into space.

   The award provides funds to accelerate production on an earlier Air Force order for 10 Titan 4 vehicles and also covers the purchase of 13 more under an Air Force program that envisions the new type of expendable vehicles as a complement to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space shuttle launches.

   The Air Force has only four of the older Titan 34D models left after two successful launches last fall broke a long dry spell in U.S. space activities.
The order for the first 10 Titan 4s was effectively suspended in April 1986 after Titan 34D failures closely followed the Challenger shuttle disaster.

   "We're looking for a robust launch capability and assured access to space," an Air Force spokesman said.

   The huge order also covers the construction of a launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that's larger than the one used to lift the older Titans.
The Titan 4 will be able to lift a 10,000-pound payload into geostationary orbit, meaning the payload remains in a fixed location relative to the earth's surface.
The Air Force said that's equal to, or better than, the shuttle's lifting capacity and 2 1/2 times more than the Titan 34Ds.
The military payloads are typically communications or reconnaissance satellites.

   Martin Marietta, an aerospace and data company based in Bethesda, Md., is the sole producer of both Titan vehicles.
The Titan 4s will be constructed at its Denver plant.
A Martin Marietta statement said the first Titan 4 launches are scheduled for late 1988.
In time, the new vehicles will be delivered at a rate that would enable Vandenberg to make six launches a year, the company said.

   In other contract awards yesterday, Negretti Aviation won an $18.9 million Navy job for gas masks for helicopter crews.

   International Business Machines Corp. was issued a $17.6 million Navy contract for SH-60B helicopter equipment.

   Amoco Oil Co. received a $16.1 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for jet fuel.

   Information Systems &amp; Networks Corp. got a $12.4 million Navy contract for intrusion-detection systems.

   The first of the Air Force's
powerful new $150 million Titan 4 space rockets was transported to
a launch pad Saturday under curious censorship.
   The 20-story-tall rocket, the largest unmanned booster in the
U.S. space stable, is scheduled to make its maiden flight next
October, boosting a classified military reconnaissance satellite.
   Development of the Titan 4 was accelerated following the
explosion that destroyed space shuttle Challenger in 1986. The
grounding of the shuttle fleet left several critical national
security payloads without a way to get into space, and many of
those will be hoisted by the new rocket.
   The Air Force, which held a media extravaganza here in January
when the first rocket was delivered and its launch pad was
dedicated, originally said the news media would be escorted to the
pad to cover Saturday's rollout.
   But Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldrich, who presided at the
January festivity, ruled the media out earlier this week, with the
Pentagon explaining only that, ``the launch sequence of military
launch vehicles is not typically an item of public discussion.''
   But when the decision was made Saturday to move the Titan 4, Air
Force public affairs officials alerted the news media at their
homes by phone. They also made arrangements to release photographs,
film and videotape of the move.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the
Eastern Space and Missile Center, replied, ``absolutely none,''
when asked if there were any security or safety reasons for barring
the press Saturday.
   A Titan 34D, predecessor of the Titan 4, is being readied on an
adjacent pad for a secret military launching, but Rand said that
had no bearing on the ruling.
   The rocket was visible for miles during its 45-minute move to
the launch pad from an assembly building. The closest point for the
public to see it was about six miles away.
   The launch pad debuts of previous space rockets have been open
to news coverage here.
   Martin Marietta is building 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force at its
plant near Denver. The Pentagon is seeking millions in public funds
to build an additional 27 boosters.
   Col. Lawrence Gooch, commander of the Eastern Space and Missile
Center, issued a statement saying, ``The rollout of the Titan 4 is
another major step toward recovering our space launch capability.''
   From Washington, Aldrich said, ``The Titan 4 program is one of
the cornerstones of our national security stategy to rebuild
assured access to space. This booster represents the new workhorse
of space for our nation.''
   For the next several months, a team of specialists from the Air
Force and Martin Marietta Astronautics Group will check the
compatibility of the rocket with the new launch pad and prepare the
vehicle for launch.
   The Air Force plans to launch two Titan 4 rockets a year from
Cape Canaveral to boost military satellites for such assignments as
reconnaissance, communications and communications intercept. Other
launches are scheduled from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
   The Titan 4 can boost 32,000-pound payloads into low Earth orbit
and 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high, where most
military satellites are based.

   The nation's most powerful unmanned
rocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the proper
orbit, effectively rendering it useless, according to a source
close to the space program.
   Engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvage
the satellite launched atop a 16-story Titan 34D Friday morning,
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Friday
night.
   However, the source was not hopeful anything could be done to
place it in the correct orbit.
   A civilian expert has said the booster carried a satellite that
could eavesdrop on Soviet military and diplomatic communications.
   A successful launch would have been the third in a row for the
Titan 34D, which was grounded for 18 months after two explosions.
   Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the Eastern
Space and Missile Center here, said the Air Force had a policy of
not commenting on the results of military space launches.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said he
knew of no problem with the launch.
   The three-stage Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad here
at 8:05 a.m Friday.
   The booster's third stage ignited correctly, putting the
satellite in a highly elliptical orbit ranging from 100 miles to
22,300 miles above the Earth, the source said.
   But the rocket failed to re-ignite, which would have put the
payload in a geosynchronous, or stationery, orbit 22,330 miles over
the Equator, said the source.
   A military reconnaissance satellite would be useless unless it
was in a geosynchronous orbit.
   The Air Force, following its practice of recent years, did not
announce the launch in advance, but issued a statement afterward.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last month the payload
would be a satellite designed to monitor Soviet missile tests and
monitor radio, telephone, radar and other electronic military and
diplomatic communications.
   He said the satellite carried an antenna built to unfold to the
size of a baseball field.
   The launch was the third for the Titan 34D, which will remain
the nation's most powerful unmanned rocket until an upgraded
version, the Titan 4, makes its launch debut later this year, also
with a military satellite. Both are made by Martin Marietta Corp.
in Denver.
   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched
successfully last October from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
Another blasted away from Cape Canaveral a month later and placed
into orbit a satellite to provide warning of a hostile missile
attack.
   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded for
18 months following two straight explosions of the rocket.
   ``These two launches (from Canaveral) and last October's launch
(from Vandenberg) illustrate the success of America's return to a
more robust space-launch capability,'' the Air Force said in its
post-launch statement.
   During the long Titan 34D grounding, the Air Force was unable to
lift heavy military satellites into orbit because the only other
available carrier, the manned space shuttle, was grounded because
of the Challenger explosion in January 1986.
   That led to a critical backlog of military payloads waiting to
get into space. To help break that logjam, the Air Force is backing
development of Titan 4, Titan 2 and Delta 2 rocket systems. They
will make their first launches either late this year or early next
year, and are expected to see considerable use over several years.

   A Titan rocket today propelled into
space a secret military payload that a civilian expert identified
as a satellite capable of eavesdropping on Soviet military and
diplomatic communications.
   The powerful, 16-story-tall Titan 34D, scoring its third
straight success after being grounded for 18 months, thundered from
its launch pad at 8:05 a.m.
   The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has
been its practice on military space flights, and afterward said
only that the Titan 34D, ``carrying a classified military
payload,'' was successfully launched.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last month the payload
would be a satellite to monitor Soviet missile tests and radio,
telephone, radar and other electronic military and diplomatic
communications.
   He said the payload carried an antenna built to unfold to the
size of a baseball field.
   Pike said the satellite project originally was code-named Chalet
but was changed to Vortex when Chalet became known. Vortex became
compromised some time ago and yet another name may have been
substituted, he said.
   The Titan 34D will remain the nation's most powerful unmanned
rocket until an upgraded version, the Titan 4, makes its launch
debut later this year, also with a military satellite. Both are
made by Martin Marietta in Denver.

   Thirty years ago, a Titan 1 missile
roared off a launch pad here on its maiden test flight, spawning an
evolution that soon will see one of its offspring debut as America's
most powerful unmanned space rocket.
   By today's standards, that first Titan 1 launch on Feb. 6, 1959,
was not much. Only the first stage was fueled, with the second
stage's tanks filled with water for weight, and it traveled only 300
miles down the Atlantic Tracking Range.
   But before many months, the Air Force rocket was hurling dummy
warheads more than 5,000 miles at speeds up to 17,000 mph.
   It was the nation's first two-stage intercontinental ballistic
missile and at the time the most powerful delivery system in its
nuclear arsenal.
   ``We certainly were plowing new ground with a two-stage vehicle.
The Titan 1 was the giant of our launch vehicle family,'' said Gary
D. Flora, who as a young engineer began working on Titans for Martin
Marietta in 1960. He now is president of the company's Space Launch
Systems Co. in Denver.
   But the Titan 1 was soon obsolete. It was replaced by the larger,
more powerful Titan 2, which with its storable fuel could sit for
months in an underground silo, ready to be fired at almost a
moment's notice.
   Fifty-four Titan 2s stood on alert for nearly 20 years in
165-foot silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona before the last one
was deactivated in 1982. The liquid-fueled missiles were replaced by
the Minuteman and the submarine-launched Trident missiles, with
advanced technology and easier-to-handle solid fuel.
   Modified Titan 2s were used in 1965 and 1966 to hoist 10 pairs of
Gemini astronauts into orbit to rehearse techniques needed to send
Apollo astronauts to the moon.
   Then, using the Titan 2 as a basic core, Martin Marietta and the
Air Force built a series of Titan 3s by improving the rocket motors,
enlarging the fuel tanks, and adding solid fuel booster rockets and
upper stages.
   Most Titan 3s were used by the Air Force to launch satellites for
such things as reconnaissance, communications, and navigation. NASA
added its Centaur upper stage to a few of the vehicles to launch the
Helios deep space probe and the Voyager and Viking payloads to
explore the planets.
   The next generation, the Titan 4, is on a Canaveral launch pad,
ready for its maiden flight within a few weeks with a classified
military payload.
   The new rocket will be able to lift 39,000 pounds into low orbit
or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit, 23,000 miles out, where
communications satellites reside.
   The Air Force has ordered 23 Titan 4s from Martin Marietta and
negotiations are under way for 26 more. The company also is
modifying 14 of the old Titan 2s removed from silos so they can
serve as medium-size space boosters. The first of these was launched
successfully with an Air Force payload last September.
   Flora said the Titan 4 is a very ``robust, blossoming program''
and he expects the rocket will be America's workhorse space rocket,
primarily for military payloads, until near the end of the century.
   ``With Titan 4 we are pushing into a new generation in terms of
lift capability,'' said W.E. Fields, director of Canaveral
Operations for Martin Marietta's Space Launch Systems.
   Fields said the Titan 4, like the Titan 3, will grow and become
even more powerful as improvements are introduced.
   And separate teams of contractors headed by Martin Marietta,
Boeing and General Dynamics are studying designs for a new rocket
for the early 21st century capable of lifting 100,000 to 200,000
pounds into orbit.
   ``Whether that becomes a derivative of Titan or not is
problematical,'' said Fields, who began working on the Titan program
in 1956.

   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and one
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication
satellites into orbit.
   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said Air
Force Capt. John Sullivan, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenberg
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.
   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or
KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said John Pike, a space policy
expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.
   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the data
system satellites are used for military communications.
   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touch
with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crews
operating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he
said.
   Pike said two SDS satellites were ``launched five years ago.
They're due for replacement.''
   SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from
Vandenberg on Titan 34Ds, he said.
   ``The reason I think it's SDS is I don't think the Air Force has
any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' Pike said.
   The Titan 34D, America's most powerful space booster, will be
supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Cape Canaveral on Sept.
2, but sources told The Associated Press it failed to place its
payload in orbit.
   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor
Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other
electronic communications.
   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Before
then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during
launches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11
and a KH-9.

   The Air Force has decided to convert a
mothballed $3.5 billion space shuttle dock into a backup pad for
launches of the Titan 4-Centaur rocket.
   The Pentagon said Friday the multimillion dollar conversion of
Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base will start
after Oct. 1.
   The first launch of Titan 4 rockets equipped with Centaur
upper-stage boosters at the pad is expected in 1996, the Pentagon
said.
   The Air Force believes the pad is needed in case an accident
ever cripples Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex-4 East, which will
be used early next year for the first West Coast launch of a Titan
4 without a Centaur upper stage, Col. Charles F. Sterling, Titan 4
program director, said in a statement.
   Sterling cited the 1985 explosion of a Titan 34D rocket that
temporarily halted use of another launch pad.
   But a critic predicted the pad will never be used because
Congress will refuse to pay for the costly military communications
and surveillance satellites meant to be launched on Titan
4-Centaurs.
   ``They've been working on this launch pad for more than two
decades and it still hasn't launched anything,'' space policy
analyst John Pike said Friday by telephone from the Federation of
American Scientists, a public interest group in Washington. ``They
just want to keep pouring concrete.''
   The conversion of SLC-6 will cost $300 million to $500 million,
and will be faster, cheaper and environmently safer than building a
new launch complex for up to $800 million, said Maj. Tom Worsdale,
a Vandenberg spokesman.
   Pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more. He said
the decision ``effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from
California.''
   The cost of Titan 4 and Titan 4-Centaurs ranges from $173
million to $265 million each, according to various Air Force and
General Accounting Office estimates.

   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space Sunday, carrying a classified payload an expert
said was probably a pair of military communications satellites.
   The powerful 16-story-tall booster blasted off under heavy cloud
cover from Space Launch Complex 4 about 10:03 a.m, said Capt. John
Sullivan, a spokesman at Vandenberg, about 140 miles northwest of
Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't

   The Titan 34D is America's most powerful space booster, although
it soon will be replaced by the Titan 4, which is due for its maiden
launch next year from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   Sunday's rocket was the last Titan 34D that will be launched from
Vandenberg. Two more are scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral
early next year.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Florida on Sept. 2, but
sources told The Associated Press it failed to orbit its payload
because the rocket's third stage failed to reignite.
   Titan 34Ds were grounded for 18 months following two successive
explosions during launches from Vandenberg in 1985 and 1986.

   America's mightiest unmanned space
rocket, a Titan 4, blasted off today with a secret military payload.
   It was the second launch of a Titan 4. The giant rocket boosted a
missile-warning satellite into orbit in June 1989.
   The rocket was launched at 1:22 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station, lighting up the sky as it thundered toward orbit.
   The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight
until about 20 minutes later, when a statement was issued. The
payload was not disclosed.
   ``This was an important launch for America's space program,''
said Martin C. Faga, the Air Force's assistant secretary for space.
``The Titan 4 is the largest booster ever launched by the Air Force.
... The Titan 4 provides our nation a vital path to space for
critical national security payloads.''
   John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists'
space policy project, said the rocket's cargo probably is a $500
million electronic eavesdropping satellite capable of intercepting
missile telemetry and radio communications.
   A less likely possibility, Pike said, is that it is a
missile-warning satellite.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1 billion contract
with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for
eight more. The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its
dependency on NASA's manned space shuttle.
   The shuttle is the most powerful cargo carrier used by the United
States, capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. The
Titan 4, an expendable launch vehicle, can lift a 39,000-pound
payload into low Earth orbit or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary
orbit 22,300 miles high.
   The Titan 4 stands 20 stories tall and is powered by two liquid
fuel main engines and two solid rocket boosters. One of the engine's
nozzles malfunctioned in last year's launch, but the other nozzle
compensated and the rocket remained on target.
   The Air Force plans to launch future Titan 4 rockets from Cape
Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
   Ten Titan 4 rockets originally were to have been launched by
October. The U.S. General Accounting Office criticized the program
in a report last month, citing schedule delays and $209 million in
cost overruns as of July 1989.
   Martin Marietta said it is working to improve production and cut
costs.
   The Denver company encountered problems with a commercial Titan 3
launch in March. An engineering design error caused the rocket's
cargo, an Intelsat communications satellite, to be placed in a
uselessly low orbit.
   Intelsat's board of governors will decide at a meeting in
Barbados this week and next whether to pay the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for a shuttle rescue mission, which could
exceed $130 million. The Washington-based consortium of 119
countries operates a global communications system.
   A commercial Titan 3 is scheduled to carry another Intelsat
communications satellite into orbit on June 21.

   A Titan rocket packing a secret
Pentagon payload streaked off on an apparently routine flight into
orbit, but the fiery blastoff ignited brush fires that closed the
launch area for more than an hour.
   The $65 million Titan 34D lifted off at 3:47 p.m. Wednesday and
appeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky.
   As with other military space flights, the Air Force did not
announce the launch in advance. But with more than 20,000 employees
working at Cape Canaveral and adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it
couldn't hide the fact that the 16-story-tall rocket was going to
be launched.
   Minutes before liftoff, hundreds of workers poured out of
buildings to watch.
   The Air Force issued a brief post-launch statement saying only
that a Titan 34D had been launched successfully. It provided no
information on the nature of the payload.
   There was no damage to launch pad from brush fires triggered by
the rocket's exhaust, officials said.
   Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, retiring commander of the Air Force
Space Division, told a conference last year that the first Titan
34D launched in 1989 would carry up two communications satellites
named DSCS _ for Defense Satellite Communications System.
   The satellites are built to provide secure voice and high data
rate transmission for American military and diplomatic
communications.
   Sources close to the project who spoke on condition of anonynity
said Wednesday the satellites were aboard the Titan 34D.
   A Chalet satellite designed to monitor Soviet communications
networks was aboard a Titan 34D launched last Sept. 2. An upper
stage failure left that payload in the wrong orbit.
   On Nov. 6, a Titan 34D successfully launched a payload believed
to be a pair of satellites intended to monitor Soviet missile tests
and electronic communciations.
   One Titan 34D remains in the Air Force inventory. It is
scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral later this year and will
be replaced by the more powerful Titan 4.
   The first Titan 4 is scheduled for launch here within a few
weeks, carrying a satellite designed to provide instant warning of
a hostile missile attack on the United States.

   Leaking rocket fuel
forced the evacuation of a Titan 2 launch pad during the weekend,
the Air Force said Tuesday.
   The Air Force declined to confirm whether the mishap Sunday
delayed the classified launch of four Navy spy satellites.
   John Pike, a space policy expert at the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last week that a classified
Titan 2 launch was expected soon.
   He said the one-time intercontinental ballistic missile, in its
maiden flight as a space booster, was almost certain to carry into
orbit a set of four White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System
satellites designed to eavesdrop on radio and radar transmissions
by the Soviet fleet.
   The Air Force and Martin Marietta Corp. have previously said
that Space Launch Complex 4 West will be used to launch refurbished
Titan 2s carrying military payloads.
   ``We had a minor vapor escape of monomethyl hydrazine at Space
Launch Complex 4 West this weekend,'' said Capt. John Sullivan, a
spokesman for the Air Force Space and Missile Test Organization at
this military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   ``The leak was detected by our sensors and the pad was evacuated
with our safety procedures,'' he added. ``The vapor dispersed
harmlessly into the atmosphere. At no time was there any danger to
the base or community population'' in nearby Vandenberg Village or
the neighboring city of Lompoc.
   Sullivan emphasized the leak wasn't serious, but said he didn't
know how many people were evacuated from the launch pad.
   He also declined comment on whether a Titan 2 was being loaded
with the hydrazine fuel to prepare it for a classified launch.
   For about 25 years, Titan 2 rockets served as ICBMs, each
carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead. Maintenance and safety
problems spurred removal of the obsolete missiles from their silos
in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona.
   The Air Force has ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta
because it was cheaper than building new rockets.

   A Titan 4, America's newest, most
powerful rocket, blasted off on its maiden flight today, reportedly
sending into space a $180 million satellite designed to provide
instant alert of a missile attack.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, a $45 million satellite
booster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close to
half a billion dollars.
   The 20-story-tall booster barreled off its launch pad at 9:18
a.m. and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twin
solid-fuel boosters as it dashed out over the Atlantic Ocean.
   Ten minutes after liftoff, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force
launch commentator, reported the rocket had successfully drilled its
secret payload into space.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because its
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster, which will
give us assured access to space for our critical heavy national
security payloads,'' Rand said.
   The Titan 4 will be the workhorse as the Pentagon assembles a
stable of rockets to solve a post-Challenger crisis that has left
about 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloads
languishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle.
   The Titan 4 can hoist 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150 to
300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to stationary orbits
23,000 miles up. It replaces the Titan 34D booster, only one of
which remains to be launched.
   The United States once had a more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5
that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon, but it was discontinued
after the lunar program. It could send a 240,000-pound payload into
orbit.
   The space shuttle, by comparison, can lift 55,000 pounds into
orbit.
   The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's largest rocket, has
nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   The Air Force said only that the big rocket was boosting a
classified payload.
   However, it has been widely reported that the rocket carried an
advanced missile warning satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific Oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   ``That would give bombers enough time to become airborne, enough
time to mobilize our own nuclear forces and enough time to get the
president into an airborne command post,'' Pike said.
   The new satellite offers about the same warning time as older
ones, but without such errors as mistaking sunlight glinting off
clouds for missile exhaust, Pike said.
   The 2{-ton satellite also will provide intelligence on routine
Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and will be able to detect
the exhaust heat from military aircraft when they fly with their
afterburners on for extra speed.
   Pike said nine of the new satellites will be launched over the
next several years into orbits 22,300 miles high to replace aging,
earlier models.
   The first of the new rockets had waited a long time for its
maiden flight. It was moved to the launch pad more than a year ago,
on May 15, 1988, to be readied for a liftoff last October. But
technical problems caused delay after delay, stretching into months
and adding millions of dollars to the cost.
   Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace is building 23 Titan 4s for the
Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two are negotiating another contract
for an additional 26 rockets.
   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger exploded in 1986 that
they were relying too heavily on the space shuttle for vital
military payloads. They more than doubled the number of Titan 4s on
order and authorized development of two new smaller rockets, the
Delta 2 and Atlas 2.
   The first two Delta 2's launched navigation satellites in
February and on Saturday.

Planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Air Force officials
announced plans Thursday to increase unmanned launches at this
coastal base, after reaffirming a decision to put its space shuttle
facilities in mothballs.
   Col. Sebastian Colitore said at the 25th Annual Space Congress
convention Thursday in Cocoa Beach, Fla., that the Air Force would
build one new launch pad and modify another at the base to launch
the Titan 4 missile.
   His statement came a day after Maj. Gen. Donald Cromer, chief of
the Space and Missile Test Organization at Vandenberg, reaffirmed a
February announcement that the $3.5 billion shuttle launch facility
at Vandenberg was being placed in mothballs because of federal
budget cuts.
   Cromer said the move would save the Air Force $40 million in
1989.
   The Air Force plans to use the shuttle pad to launch other,
unmanned missles, Maj. Sgt. Bruce Zielsdorf, a Vandenberg
spokesman, said Thursday.
   The Titan 4, the military's workhorse missile, carries huge,
shuttle-sized payloads and satellites into orbit. The first planned
launch of the Titan 4, which is 20 feet taller than the shuttle at
204 feet, is set for February 1990, Colitore said.
   The Air Force also will modify another launch pad for old Titan
2 intercontinental missiles that are being refurbished into space
boosters, said Lt. Col. Mike Callaway, project manager. The first
launch of the Titan 2 is set for July 1 at Vandenberg, he said.
   Colitore said the Air Force would increase its unmanned launches
at Vandenberg, 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles on the California
coast.
   The Vandenberg shuttle site has been regularly maintained at a
cost of $50 million a year since the space shuttle Challenger
exploded during launch in Florida in January 1986, killing the
seven people aboard.
   It was to be the next site of a shuttle launch in July 1986. But
after the Challenger disaster, NASA moved the launch back to 1992.
Now launches have been indefinitely postponed at Vandenberg,
although an August shuttle launch is planned at Cape Canaveral in
Florida.
   Even if Vandenberg's vast shuttle complex, which includes a
launch pad, buildings and runway, were to be reactivated, it would
take at least four years for it to be functional, Zielsdorf said.

   A secret new spy satellite circled
the globe in a useless orbit Saturday, leaving the United States to
continue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning of
missile attacks.
   The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Soviet
communications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbit
by a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday.
   But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed to
achieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upper
stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about
100 to 22,300 miles above Earth.
   He said the payload was useless on that course and there was
little hope of salvaging the mission.
   The Air Force, as is its custom with military launches, did not
announce the liftoff in advance. Several minutes after launch, with
the Titan apparently working well, it reported a successful start
to the mission.
   Asked about the reported failure, Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand,
director of public affairs at the Eastern Space and Missile Center
here, said the Pentagon had a policy of not commenting on the
results of military space flights.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said the satellite was
code-named Vortex, a series designed to monitor Soviet missile
tests and military and diplomatic electronic communications.
   It was intended to replace a satellite that has been in use for
several years and is showing signs of wear, the source reported.
   Aging is a problem with many of America's military satellites
and is causing concern among military planners, who over the last
two decades have relied heavily on space-based systems for
reconnaissance, communications, electronic eavesdropping,
missile-attack alert and navigation.
   Since the space shuttle Challenger explosion and a Titan 34D
blowup, both in early 1986, the Pentagon has been limited in its
ability to lift heavy satellites into orbit to replace older
systems, many of which continue to operate long past their
anticipated operational lifetimes.
   The Titan 34D, the United States' most powerful unmanned rocket,
was grounded for redesign for 18 months following its 1986 failure.
   Flights resumed late last year with two straight successes _
deployment of reconnaissance and missile attack warning satellites,
the only two heavy U.S. military payloads launched successfully in
the last 2{ years.
   Friday's launch was the first for the Titan 34D since those 1987
flights, and it had been delayed several months by technical
problems.
   Only three more Titan 34Ds remain in the inventory, with the
rocket to be replaced starting later this year by the more powerful
Titan 4.
   The redesigned space shuttle is scheduled to resume flights late
this month or in early October, and the Pentagon has booked
critically needed military satellites on five of the first nine
missions.
   Even before Challenger, the Defense Department realized it was
depending too much on the shuttle for access to space and began
developing the Titan 4 over the objection of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The Air Force is shepherding the construction of 50 Titan 4s and
a large number of smaller Delta 2s and Titan 2s to launch a family
of military satellites over the next several years, gradually
cutting back on its use of the shuttle.

   The debut of the Delta 2 space rocket
next month and that of the powerful Titan 4 a few weeks later
highlight the Air Force's busiest launch year here since 1983, an
official says.
   The Pentagon is counting on both rockets to help orbit a backlog
of about 25 national defense payloads that have been grounded since
the 1986 explosions of the space shuttle Challenger and an unpiloted
Titan 34D rocket.
   Problems that have held up the two launches for months are being
resolved, Air Force Col. Lawrence L. Gooch, commander of the Eastern
Space and Missile Center, told reporters Tuesday.
   The Delta 2 will carry two military navigation satellites on its
first flight Feb. 7 and the Titan 4, which will be America's most
powerful expendable rocket, will hoist a classified payload a few
weeks later, Gooch said.
   The 1989 launch schedule calls for seven military Delta 2s, two
commercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan 4s, two smaller Titan
34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two commercial Atlas-Centaurs and
one with a Navy communications satellite; and six to eight submarine
test launches of the Navy's powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missile.
   The missile center also will support seven National Aeronautics
and Space Administration space shuttle launchings during 1989,
starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.
   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since
1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.
   Launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold the total
down, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, but if we
can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''
   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to significantly
increase its Titan 4 order after space shuttle Challenger exploded
on Jan. 26, 1986.
   The Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unpiloted rockets and
had been putting all their launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle.
The Challenger disaster convinced officials that strategy had been a
mistake, and they ordered expendable rockets to ensure American
access to space.
   Gooch estimated 40 military, commercial and NASA space payloads
have backed up as a result of the 32-month standdown after the
shuttle accident and because of the Titan 34D grounding for several
months. About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense,
he said.
   Cape Canaveral range may have problems supporting the schedule if
there are delays in a lot of the missions, Gooch said.
   A shortage of people to handle launches could be another problem,
Gooch said. The colonel said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100
people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations group.

   A giant Titan 4 rocket thundered into
orbit Friday with what's believed to be a military surveillance
satellite. Air Force officials said the early morning launch went
smoothly.
   It was the second launch of the nation's most powerful unmanned
space rocket and one of three planned for this year.
   ``Everything went very well. It was a beautiful sight to
behold,'' said Air Force Col. Frank Stirling, director of the Titan
program. ``It was a great step for us in the Air Force to get the
second Titan 4 launched on time as planned.''
   The $173 million rocket blasted off at 1:22 a.m. from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station. It resembled a large ball of fire as it
cut through clouds on its way toward an undisclosed orbit.
   The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight
until it issued a statement about 20 minutes after liftoff. The
payload was not revealed, but civilian experts believe it is an
electronic eavesdropping satellite or a missile-warning spacecraft.
   A Titan 4 successfully boosted a missile-warning satellite into
orbit in June 1989, even though an engine nozzle malfunctioned.
Stirling said the problem was corrected and did not occur in
Friday's launch.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1 billion contract
with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for
eight more. The goal is to have 75 by the end of 1997, which would
put the cost of the program at $17 billion, Stirling said.
   The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to serve as a
complimentary launch vehicle to NASA's manned space shuttle, the
most powerful cargo carrier used by the United States.
   The shuttle is capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into
orbit. The Titan 4, which stands 20 stories tall, can lift a
39,000-pound cargo into low Earth orbit or carry 10,000 pounds to
stationary orbit 22,300 miles high.
   After the 1986 Challenger explosion, the Air Force revamped the
program and targeted the Titan 4 as its primary booster for heavy
Pentagon payloads.
   Stirling said the switch from ``an off-the-shelf'' rocket to one
of shuttle caliber led to schedule delays and a $209 million in cost
overruns as of July 1989.
   The U.S. General Accounting Office cited program delays and cost
overruns in a report last month, noting that 10 rockets originally
were to have been launched by October.
   The rocket launched Friday could have gone up several months ago,
but its payload was not ready, Stirling said.
   The Air Force plans to launch two more Titan 4 rockets this year
from either Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg, Stirling said. Several
rockets are at each site, ready to go, he said.
   Smaller rockets such as the Delta and Atlas will be used to carry
lighter payloads, Stirling said. The space shuttle will be used only
if astronauts' assistance or the shuttle's unique capabilities are
required, he said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret military payload into
orbit next month. It will be the seventh shuttle mission dedicated
to the Defense Department; only a few remain on the shuttle flight
manifest.
   ``Right now, the idea is to have a robust and capable launch
vehicle program that stands alone, based on a mixed fleet, so we
never get into a posture again of having to rely on a single means
of access to space which is in many regards technically fragile,''
Stirling said.

   A Titan 4, the workhorse rocket that
will let the Pentagon reduce its dependence on the space shuttle,
lifted into orbit what was believed to be a satellite capable of
warning against missile attack.
   The 20-stories-tall Titan, America's mightiest unmanned rocket,
lit up NASA's two shuttle launch pads a few miles away - one
occupied by Atlantis, the other by Columbia - as it headed out over
the Atlantic on Monday night.
   The launch had been delayed two months by problems that included
leaking propellant.
   Air Force officials refused even to acknowledge the launch prior
to liftoff and would not disclose the nature of the payload, but
civilian experts said they believed it was a $180 million missile
warning satellite.
   A spacecraft of this type could be used to detect instantly the
launch of Iraqi missiles against sites in the Middle East, said
John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists' space
policy project.
   It was the Air Force's third launch of the Titan 4, valued at
$173 million. The first one was in 1989, and the second one in
June. Neither had a similar leak problem, said Col. Frank Stirling,
director of the Titan program.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems of Denver has a $7.1
billion contract with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets,
with an option for eight more. The Air Force wants 75 by the end of
1997.
   The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its
dependence on the pace shuttle.
   A fleet of Titans will allow the Air Force to launch with more
consistency, Stirling said. ``Should we ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.
   Atlantis' flight on Thursday, during which it will put into
orbit a military satellite, is the last classified Pentagon shuttle
mission.
   Two more Defense Department shuttle flights are planned, both
next year, but they will not be surrounded by secrecy.
   NASA's shuttle, the strongest cargo carrier used in the United
States, is capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into orbit.
   The Titan 4 can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into low Earth orbit
or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high.

<HEAD>Four Navy Spy Satellites Said To Soar Aboard Refurbished ICBM</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 2 rocket that
once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into
space Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to be
four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships.
   The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles
had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second
time U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a
week.
   ``It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as
expected,'' said Air Force Capt. Norma Payne.
   But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two
to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended
polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles.
   The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition to
the Navy's White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System, an
electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Soviet
and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, space
policy analyst John Pike said before the launch.
   ``The Navy really likes them,'' said Pike, of the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. ``They are very
important for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.''
   Pike said a White Cloud launch ``consists of one mother
satellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit is
reached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so
all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in
polar orbit.
   The $37.5 million Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 West
and into fog-shrouded skies at 2:25 a.m. PDT, Ms. Payne said at
this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town of
Lompoc, where police said they received a half-dozen calls from
residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch.
   The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capable
of lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit.
   Starting in the 1960s, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in
Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona, where they served as intercontinental
ballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead.
   But the missiles were removed from service ``because the
propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had
a tendency to blow up,'' Pike said.
   The Air Force then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta Corp.
Air Force officials have said more are likely to be refurbished
because recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building new
rockets.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But a source close to the project,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the
upper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there was
little hope of salvaging that mission.
   Despite that failure, Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete''
Aldridge issued a prepared statement after Monday's launch,
declaring, ``This is the year of space launch recovery.''
   ``Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three new
boosters the Air Force will launch in the coming year,'' Aldridge
said. ``The Titan 2, Titan 4 and the Delta 2 ... will ensure this
nation's access to space for many years to come.''
   The launch had been expected a week earlier, but apparently was
delayed by a fuel leak that the Air Force said spurred evacuation
of the launch pad Aug. 28. No one was hurt in that incident,
officials said.
   Pike said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost into
orbit from Vandenberg was a Defense Meteorological Support Program
satellite. But he called that unlikely.
   A Titan 2 exploded in its Arkansas silo on Sept. 19, 1980,
killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-wide
crater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet
from the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo
evacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have been
replaced by Minuteman, Midgetman and MX missiles.
   Pike said Air Force officials have testified before Congress
that the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for one
launch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launches
of DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a
classified program.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, he said.
   Pike compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or Radar Ocean
Reconaissance Satellites, which monitor U.S. ship movements.

   The long-delayed launch debuts of two
new military space rockets, the Delta 2 and Titan 4, should occur
within two months as the Air Force prepares for what could be the
busiest launch year here since 1983, an official said Tuesday.
   The commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center, Air Force
Col. Lawrence L. Gooch, said the Delta 2, carrying a pair of
military navigation satellites, is set for liftoff Feb. 7, with the
Titan 4, which will be America's most powerful unmanned rocket, to
follow within a few weeks.
   Gooch told reporters the current schedule for 1989 calls for
seven Delta 2s, two commercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan
4s, two smaller Titan 34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two
commercial Atlas-Centaurs and one with a Navy communications
satellite, and six to eight submarine test launches of the Navy's
powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missiles.
   In addition, the missile center will support seven NASA space
shuttle launchings during 1989, starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.
   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since
1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.
   But launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold down
the total, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, but
if we can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''
   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to greatly
increase its Titan 4 order following the explosion of space shuttle
Challenger in 1986.
   Both the Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unmanned rockets
and putting all launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle. After
Challenger, officials realized this was a mistake and they ordered
expendable rockets to give the nation assured access to space.
   Gooch estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up, waiting
for a rocket ride, as a result of the 32-month shuttle standdown
after the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the Titan
34D for several months after back-to-back failures in 1885 and 1986.
About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense, he said.
   Gooch said the range may have problems supporting the schedule if
there are delays in a lot of the missions.
   Citing the Trident 2 submarine launches, the first of which is
scheduled in about two months, he said, ``If you have a Trident sub
at sea, and it comes in here for demonstration firings, that's a lot
of resources and involves a national defense commitment.''
   In most cases, the Trident launch probably would have priority
over all except the most critical defense satellite launches.
   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 already has been delayed six
months and the debut of the Titan 4 about five months by problems
preparing the new rockets and their refurbished launch pads.
   Another problem, Gooch said, could be a shortage of manpower to
support launches. He said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100
skilled people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations
group.

A powerful Titan rocket Wednesday propelled into space a secret Pentagon
payload believed to be a pair of advanced satellites for worldwide U.S.
military and diplomatic communications.
</P>
<P>
The 16-story-tall, $65-million Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad and
appeared to be flying normally as it rumbled out over the Atlantic through
partly cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
The fiery exhaust ignited several brush fires that kept the launch pad area
closed for more than an hour. There was no damage to facilities, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has been its
practice on military space flights for several years. It issued a brief
post-launch statement that said only that a Titan 34D had been "launched
successfully." It provided no information on the nature of the payload.
</P>
<P>
Although the Pentagon tried to keep the launch secret, with more than 20,000
employees working at Cape Canaveral and the adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it
proved difficult for them to hide the fact that a rocket that large was going
to be launched.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the Titan 34D lifted off, hundreds of workers poured out of
buildings to watch.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, outgoing commander of the Air Force Space Division,

</P>
<P>

DSCS satellites were aboard the Titan 34D. DSCS satellites are built to provide
secure voice and high data-rate transmission for American military and

<HEAD>Titan 4 Rocket Gives Pentagon Ability to Launch Heavy Military Payloads</HEAD>

   With the successful maiden launch of
the huge Titan 4, the Pentagon has an unmanned rocket that lessens
its reliance on the space shuttle for lifting heavy military
satellites into orbit.
   Nearly 40 of those satellites have languished in storage for lack
of a launch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded more than
three years ago.
   The 20-story-tall Titan 4 made a spectacular debut Wednesday when
it thundered off its launch pad with a 2{-ton satellite designed to
provide instant alert of a missile attack on the United States.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, the $180 million
satellite, a $45 million payload booster stage and other costs
raising the total to close to $500 billion.
   The Air Force reported the big rocket had successfully passed its
maiden test and placed its military satellite in orbit.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because it's
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster which will give
us assured access to space for our critical heavy national security
payloads,'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman.
   The Air Force reported only that the rocket launched Wednesday
carried a classified payload which it would not identify for
national security reasons.
   However, it has been widely reported by knowledgeable observers
and by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine and other
publications that the rocket carried an advanced missile warning
satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   Defense Department officials decided after Challenger exploded in
1986 that they were relying too much on the manned shuttle for
critical military payloads. So they more than doubled the number of
Titan 4s on order and authorized development of two new smaller
rockets, the Delta 2 and Atlas 2, for medium-size payloads.
   The Delta 2 made its debut in February, carrying a navigation
satellite into orbit. It repeated with another navigation payload
Saturday.
   The shuttle flights resumed last September, and the second flight
in December deployed one of the backlogged heavy military
satellites. Two more are scheduled on shuttle flights later this
year, with at least one more Titan 4 launch planned.
   The Pentagon hopes eventually to shift most of the payloads to
the Titan 4, which can boost 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150
to 300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to so-called
stationary orbits 23,000 miles up.
   The U.S. once had a much more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5 that
launched Apollo astronauts to the moon. It could hoist 240,000
pounds into orbit. The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's
largest rocket, has nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   Both the Air Force and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are studying designs fpr a large advanced booster
capable of lifting between 150,000 and 200,000 pounds to orbit.
   The space shuttle can deliver 55,000 pounds.

<P>
The Titan 4 booster rocket that erupted in fire at Edwards Air Force Base on
Friday while being assembled by crane is a key part of the Air Force's answer
to the space shuttle -- a powerful, unmanned rocket that can launch heavy
payloads into space.
</P>
<P>
But the $200-million-a-shot Titan, like its civilian counterpart, has had its
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4, the latest in a generation of rockets that grew out of the
intercontinental ballistic missile program, is a "top-of-the-line launch
vehicle," said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, it is over budget and far behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials have never been comfortable relying on the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to launch its satellites into orbit -- as
Congress ordered it to do more than a decade ago as part of an effort to make
the shuttle "economical" by ensuring an ample supply of customers. After the
space shuttle Challenger exploded in January, 1986, the Air Force successfully
renewed its effort to win congressional approval to get back into the launching
business.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4, designed to carry as much payload into orbit as the shuttle, is
supposed to free the Air Force of its dependence on NASA.
</P>
<P>
But Friday, with the civilian space shuttle fleet grounded because of hydrogen
fuel leaks, the Air Force was left trying to explain a massive fire that is
bound to raise the same kind of questions in Washington that NASA has been
trying to answer about its shuttle program.
</P>
<P>
The fire, of course, is not the same sort of problem that has been confronting
NASA -- which in addition to its shuttle problems has a space telescope that
doesn't work right -- but the accident once again reveals the vulnerability of
any space program.
</P>
<P>
"This (the Titan 4) is our way of lifting heavy payloads for the future,"
Logsdon said. "This is it."
</P>
<P>
And the Air Force, he added, may be guilty of placing all its eggs in one
basket, just as NASA did with the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say there has been criticism of the Air Force for placing all its
eggs in a new basket, called Titan 4," he said. "It owns the Titan 4, whereas
it didn't own the shuttle."
</P>
<P>
Thus, Logsdon noted, problems with that vehicle would leave the Air Force open
to the same kind of criticism that NASA faces -- placing too much reliance on
one system.
</P>
<P>
Although the overall record of the Titan program has been good, with more than
200 successful launches dating back to 1962, the newer-generation vehicles have
had their problems. Two Titan 34D rockets -- the Titan 4's immediate
predecessor -- failed during launch attempts at Vandenberg Air Force Base in
1985 and 1986, the second coming just months after the Challenger disaster.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Vandenberg, Titans can also be launched from the Cape Canaveral
Air Force Station in Florida, just south of the Kennedy Space Center. Both
sites have seen the launches of Titans in the past, but the Titan 4 represents
a new stage in the nation's space program.
</P>
<P>
Rockets are not launched from Edwards because they would have to travel over
populated areas during their hazardous early ascent. The Titan involved in
Friday's accident was at the Air Force's Astronautics Laboratory at the
sprawling base, where it was undergoing tests.
</P>
<P>
The powerful rocket uses a two-stage, liquid-fueled main propulsion system,
plus two solid rockets strapped to its sides. The solids give the rocket its
initial lift off the pad, and the first-stage main engine fires shortly after
the boosters separate from the rocket. The second stage ignites last, carrying
the payload either into Earth orbit or, at least potentially, into deep space.
</P>
<P>
Solid rockets, like the one that caught fire Friday, have been controversial
since they were introduced in the U.S. space program. Critics argued that once
a solid is ignited, it cannot be shut down. Supporters argued that solids would
be the most reliable way of boosting the carrying capacity of large rockets.
</P>
<P>
The fuel used in the Titan 4 booster, as in all solid-fuel rockets, is highly
flammable, as Friday's accident demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, a solid rocket is like a firecracker," Logsdon said. "You treat it
with a great deal of respect."
</P>
<P>
Once the two solid rockets are ignited, the fuel is supposed to burn for two
minutes in a controlled fire that generates 1.4 million pounds of thrust.
</P>
<P>
The solids are blasted free of the main rocket after their fuel has been
exhausted, and the liquid-fueled engine takes over.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4's capacity is slightly less than the shuttle's. It can put almost
10,000 pounds into geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth. At that
altitude the payload orbits at just the right speed to remain stationary over
one spot on the Earth's surface, an ideal situation for communications
satellites.
</P>
<P>
The capacity varies according to which launching site is used. Any rocket can
carry a heavier load into space from the Cape than it can from Vandenberg.
Payloads are launched into equatorial orbit from the Cape, so the rocket
benefits from the spin of the Earth, which is equivalent to around 1,000 miles
an hour at the Equator. The effect is similar to that of throwing a rock out
the window of a moving car.
</P>
<P>
But payloads are launched into polar orbit from Vandenberg, and that slingshot
effect is lost, so the weight of the load must be reduced.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRONOLOGY OF TITAN ACCIDENTS
</P>
<P>
Here is a chronology of Titan accidents, involving various models, over the
last 25 years. Several accidents also occurred in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 5, 1988: An expended first stage section of a liquid-fuel Titan 2 rocket
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base exploded after separating from the
second stage of the craft, which was otherwise successful in completing its
mission of placing four spy satellites in orbit.
</P>
<P>
April 18, 1986: A Titan 34D carrying a secret spy satellite exploded nine
seconds after being launched from Vandenberg, causing minor injuries to 58
people. Insulation on one of the solid-fueled booster rockets separated from
the rocket casing, causing a "burn-through."
</P>
<P>
Aug. 28, 1985: A Titan 34D was destroyed along with a spy satellite in a launch
failure at Vandenberg Air Force Base caused by an oxidizer leak and a pump
malfunction in the core booster.
</P>
<P>
Sept. 19, 1980: A Titan 2 missile exploded in its silo near Damascus, Ark.,
after a workman dropped a wrench and punctured its fuel tank. One man was
killed and at least 21 were injured. Several others were stricken ill by toxic
fumes during the days after the explosion. A nuclear warhead, thrown 200 yards
by the explosion, landed without incident. The explosion was the eleventh Titan
missile accident in Arkansas in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
March 25, 1978: A Titan 3C with twin military communications satellites was
ordered destroyed shortly after malfunctioning on liftoff from Cape Canaveral.
In other accidents in 1978, two people were killed and 27 were hospitalized in
Kansas and Arkansas after exposure to highly toxic fumes associated with the
liquid propellants.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 26, 1966: A Titan 3C rocket launched from Florida exploded shortly after
liftoff, destroying a payload of eight communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 9, 1965: A flash fire caused when a welder's torch struck a line carrying
combustible fluid killed 53 civilian workers who were renovating a Titan 1 silo
near Damascus, Ark., to accommodate a newer Titan 2 missile.

<HEAD>Pieces Missing From Titan Rocket Motor After Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chunks missing from a Titan 4 motor
after a recent ground test could mean a delay in the first
scheduled launch of the rocket in October, the San Jose Mercury
News reported Wednesday.
   The test was conducted Feb. 14 at the San Jose research
facilities of United Technologies Corp., whose engineers, along
with Air Force specialists, are trying to find out if a flaw might
require retesting or redesign, the newspaper said.
   U.S. space officials have been counting on the Titan 4 to carry
into orbit dozens of satellites.
   ``There are some chunks missing, not terribly large,'' spokesman
Rick Huling of the El Segundo Air Force unit said. ``I think in one
particular case the burn was down fairly close to the metal on the
outside of the (nozzle) casing. If the flames had burned through
the remaining insulation and ruptured the metal nozzle case, then
you've had it.''
   A smaller Titan 34D rocket exploded April 18, 1986, during
launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base when some insulation broke
loose inside the motor. The heat burned through the rocket's outer
wall.
   The Titan 4 launch, scheduled for October from the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., would take up a classified military
payload that analysts have said is a satellite equipped with a
heat-sensitive infrared telescope to spot nuclear missile attacks.
   ``We have a backlog of space shuttle-size loads,'' said Huling.
``The Titan 4 is, in fact, going to be the substitute for anything
that doesn't need a man up there in space. I would say we need to
get up there as quickly as possible.''
   The manned shuttle program was put on hold after the Challenger
explosion, with the target date for the next launch set for Aug. 4.

<HEAD>Pentagon Panel Says Super Rocket Not Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States doesn't need a super rocket
and can rely on its fleet of expendable launch vehicles through the
end of the century, a Defense Department advisory panel says.
   Instead of building a heavy-lift booster, the Defense Science
Board said, the military should push two technical approaches that
hold promise for breakthroughs in rocket technology: the
air-breathing propulsion being developed for the National Aerospace
Plane, and nuclear engines.
   ``Although launching rockets incorporating nuclear devices
presents emotional and political difficulties, the task force review
leads us to recommend continued investment in this area,'' said the
report released Monday.
   The board's finding would, in effect, leave the Soviet Union
unchallenged in heavy-lift capacity. Its Energia is the world's most
powerful rocket, capable of putting a 220,000-pound cargo into low
Earth orbit.
   The most powerful cargo carrier used by the United States is the
space shuttle, which can lift 52,000 pounds into orbit. The biggest
expendable rocket, the Titan 4, can carry a 39,000-pound payload.
   In the Apollo moon landing program of the late 1960s and early
1970s, the United States used Saturn 5 rockets capable of lifting
310,000 pounds of cargo. But the assembly lines were shut down when
that program ended.
   The science board said it was uncomfortable with a 1987 national
security directive signed by President Reagan that called for
development of a heavy-lift launch vehicle for the anti-missile
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Rather than developing a more powerful booster or a new family of
expendable rockets, the report said, research should concentrate on
improving rocket engines.
   ``If the rocket engines are in an advanced state of development,
a launch vehicle can be developed faster than any payload it would
be required to carry,'' it said.
   ``Unless there is a decision to deploy SDI, the annual national
security payload to orbit averages less than 600,000 pounds,'' the
report added. ``Individual payloads do not exceed 50,000 pounds. No
heavy lift requirement, with the possible exception of an experiment
for SDI, is evident.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has talked of
developing a vehicle, to be called Shuttle-C, that would substitute
a cargo canister for the space shuttle orbiter. It would be able to
lift about 150,000 pounds and be used to carry construction parts
for the space station.
   The report called also for building a second pad for launching
Titan 4 rockets at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
   ``The single Titan 4 pad at Vandenberg is a major risk,'' it
said. ``Payloads to polar orbit can only be launched from the West
Coast, and the April 1986 Titan 34D accident demonstrated how much
damage can be done to a launch complex by a booster malfunction.''

   A Titan 4 missile blew up
at a rocket test site Friday, killing one person, leaving one
missing and sending up a huge mushroom cloud over the desert,
authorities said.
   The Titan 4 booster rocket exploded at the testing laboratory at
about 10:45 a.m., said Staff Sgt. Thomas Morgan.
   The blast left one person dead and one missing, said Lt. Col.
Rick Oborn, a spokesman at the Pentagon.
   Oborn said an initial report from the scene indicated that the
blast was due to the explosion of ``one of the stages of a Titan
missile booster.''
   The spokesman said one of the rocket's stages was being moved,
was somehow dislodged or dropped, and exploded upon impact.
   ``It appears to have been one of the solid fuel sections'' of
the booster, Oborn said.
   The resulting plume was moving away from populated areas at an
altitude that posed no immediate threat to residents, Morgan said.
   ``There was a big cloud of smoke. It was really bright,'' said
Roberta Martinson, clerk at a convenience store in Boron.
   Base officials contacted the California Highway Patrol, which
closed a 30-mile stretch of Highway 58. The road, which runs across
the north side of the base, was reopened a short time later.
   There were no evacuations of the area, 70 miles northeast of Los
Angeles, said Capt. Chris Angelo of the Kern County Fire
Department's Boron station.
   ``It was high enough that we felt it wouldn't come down,''
Angelo said.
   Titan 4s, built by Martin Marietta Corp., are considered the Air
Force's primary booster for launching its heavy payloads into space.
   The second Titan 4 built, worth $173 million, was launched June
8 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., carrying a secret surveillance
satellite into orbit. The first was launched on June 14, 1989,
boosting what analysts said was either a missile-warning satellite
or an electronic eavesdropping satellite.
   Ten launches had been planned during 1990-91, but six were
postponed because of delays in preparing launch sites and taking
delivery of the rockets. As of June, the Air Force said it planned
two more Titan 4 launches this year.
   The Pentagon also has said it plans to launch 10 Titan 4s
annually by 1995.
   The Air Force initially planned to build only 10 Titan 4s to
complement the space shuttle as a way to launch heavy payloads. But
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members prompted the Pentagon to decide to obtain many
more.
   The shuttle can put a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. The Titan
4, which stands 20 stories tall, can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into
low Earth orbit or a 10,000-pound payload to a fixed orbit 22,300
miles high.
   As of June, the Air Force had let contracts for construction of
41 Titan 4s, and had funds available for nine more. The service
planned to procure 100 Titan 4s by the year 2000.

A giant Titan 4 rocket thundered into orbit early Friday with what was believed
to be a military surveillance satellite.
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said the early morning launching went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
It was the second launching of the nation's most powerful unmanned space rocket
and one of three planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
"Everything went very well. It was a beautiful sight to behold," Air Force Col.
Frank Stirling, director of the Titan program, said. "It was a great step for
us in the Air Force to get the second Titan 4 launched on time as planned."
</P>
<P>
The $173-million rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It
resembled a large ball of fire as it cut through clouds on its way toward an
undisclosed orbit.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight until it issued
a statement about 20 minutes after liftoff. The payload was not disclosed, but
civilian experts believe it is an electronic eavesdropping satellite or a
missile-warning spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
A Titan 4 successfully boosted a missile-warning satellite into orbit in June,
1989, even though an engine nozzle malfunctioned. Stirling said the problem was
corrected and did not occur in Friday's launching.
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1-billion contract with the Air
Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for eight more. The goal is
to have 75 by the end of 1997, which would put the cost of the program at $17
billion, Stirling said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to serve as a complementary launching
vehicle to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's manned space
shuttle.

<TEXT>
   An advanced navigation satellite
soared into orbit Tuesday aboard the maiden flight of the Air
Force's new Delta 2 rocket, a booster developed to carry vital
military payloads grounded after the space shuttle Challenger
explosion.
   It was the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the Pentagon
is ordering in a $14 billion program to resolve a post-Challenger
crisis that has seen about 40 needed reconnaissance and other
national security payloads languish in storage for want of a launch
vehicle.
   The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite carried on the
Delta 2's maiden flight Tuesday was the first military payload
shifted off the shuttle manifest to a throwaway booster.
   The $30 million, 128-foot rocket roared off its launch pad at
1:30 p.m., and the Air Force reported 30 miunutes later it had
performed flawlessly in lofting the $65 million satellite into an
initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles
above the Earth.
   ``It was in every way a picture-perfect launch,'' Air Force Lt.
Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, told a news conference. ``The
satellite came up very strong and we're receiving a good signal.''
   On Thursday, an on-board rocket motor is to fire to shift the
satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up.
   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS is an advanced version of seven
earlier model Navstars currently in orbit. The new satellite will
tell U.S. and allied military forces where they are to within a few
feet anywhere on the globe _ land, sea or air.
   The new satellite has more power and other improved systems and
has two information channels instead of one, with the second being
encrypted for use only by the military.
   Users of the military channel will be able to plot their
locations to within 50 feet, in some cases to within 5 or 6 feet,
officials said.
   Civilian users will have to be satisfied with an accuracy of
about 300 feet, still pretty good if a person is in the middle of an
ocean or a jungle, said Col. Marty E. Runkle, director of the Joint
Global Positioning System Office of the Air Force Space Division.
   ``Just about any military system or operation you can conceive of
can use the GPS system for location _ airplanes, trucks, submarines,
tanks, troops, whatever,'' Runkle told a news conference. ``Midair
refueling or a linkup at sea in dark nights, through the fog, can be
done without any communications or turning on of radar. Typically
you have to turn on radar and essentially light up the sky.''
   The satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded Navstars the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving
anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning
information.
   The Air Force originally planned to launch all 21 on NASA's space
shuttle fleet. But that plan was scrapped after the shuttle
Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. Now only two Navstars remain
scheduled on the shuttle.
   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger they had made a
mistake in abandoning unmanned rockets to launch all payloads on the
shuttle, and authorized the building of three new models of rockets
_ the medium-size Delta 2 and Atlas 2 and the much larger Titan 4.
   The Delta 2, a more powerful version of the earlier Delta rocket
that has been flying since 1960, is the first of the new rockets to
fly. The Titan 4 is scheduled to debut next month and the Atlas 2
next year.
   The grounding of the shuttle and the Air Force Titan 34D rocket,
also after a 1986 failure, created a backlog of about 40
reconnaisance, communications, navigation and other national
security satellites.
   Six more Delta, four Titan and two military shuttle flights
scheduled this year will help drain down that backlog.

A Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites roared
into space Sunday night after nine postponements as Martin Marietta Corp.
entered the commercial launch business.
</P>
<P>
The 155-foot-tall booster blasted away from its launch pad at the Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station at 7:07 p.m. and gave thousands of spectators a
dazzling New Year's Eve show, brilliantly lighting the night sky as it climbed
toward orbit.
</P>
<P>
"Everything looks good," mission commentator Bob Gordon reported as the rocket
sped into space. Twenty minutes after liftoff mission director Vic Whitehead
reported the Titan 3 upper stage carrying the satellites had achieved a
successful orbit ranging from 117 to 437 miles high.
</P>
<P>
The Titan got away on its 10th attempt. Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch
was delayed once by a technical problem and eight times by strong, high
altitude winds. The wind was no problem Sunday night and the countdown
proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff.
</P>
<P>
Packed in the nose cone of the most powerful U.S. commercial rocket were the
14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites.
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4A was ejected from the Titan's nose cone into its planned preliminary
orbit a little more than an hour after launch and JCSAT 2 followed about an
hour and a half later. On-board rocket motors were to boost the relay stations
to their operational altitude of 22,300 miles.
</P>
<P>
JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network, providing
telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data services. It is owned by
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co.
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for communicating with
land, sea and air forces.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company and British government share the $125-million cost of the
rocket and launch services provided by Martin Marietta.
</P>
<P>
Roaring with power, the Titan's boosters burned out about two minutes after
liftoff as planned and fell away into the Atlantic Ocean. The liquid-fueled
Titan "core" vehicle then continued the ascent, looking like a brilliant star
as the vehicle disappeared to the east.
</P>
<P>
The flight plan called for Skynet 4 to be deployed from the Titan's
second-stage nose cone one hour and 12 minutes after liftoff. JCSAT-2 was to
follow suit about an hour and a half after that.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the second big U.S.
rocket to enter the commercial market, launching payloads for a fee. McDonnell
Douglas was the first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a communications
satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August.
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics plans to enter the competition next year with its Atlas
rocket.

<TEXT>
   The reported explosion of a Titan 2 rocket
stage as it fell away from a booster did not prevent four Navy spy
satellites from climbing toward their proper orbits, sources said.
   ``The satellites are moving exactly as they should be,'' an Air
Force source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Everything is just peachy.''
   The satellites were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base 140
miles northwest of Los Angeles on Monday atop a 103-foot-high,
liquid-fueled Titan 2. The Lompoc Record newspaper, quoting ground
observers, reported Tuesday that the Titan 2's expended first stage
apparently blew up in a secondary explosion after separating from
the booster's second stage. The rest of the booster was seen
continuing skyward.
   A second source, also insisting on anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the satellites were not endangered.
   Neither source could confirm the secondary explosion, but said
they wouldn't necessarily know of such an event if it didn't affect
deployment of the satellites.
   ``I checked into it and everything I know is positive,'' said
Capt. Marty Hauser, an Air Force public affairs officer at the
Pentagon. ``It went well.''
   The observers, who were very familiar with launch procedures,
believed the crimson flash resulted from a puncture in a nearly
empty oxidizer tank on the the $37.5 million rocket's first stage,
according to the Record.
   The newspaper said similar anomalies happened after launches of
other rockets at Vandenberg without preventing their payloads from
reaching orbit.
   Capt. Norma Payne, a Vandenberg spokeswoman, would not discuss
whether an explosion occurred or whether the secret payload reached
proper orbit.
   ``We're not going to comment on the results of a (classified)
space flight,'' she said.
   Space policy expert John Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists has identified the Titan 2's payload as a White Cloud
Navy Ocean Surveillance System of four satellites which would be
used to listen to the Soviet fleet's radar and radio communications.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, Pike said.
   The rocket was the first of a series of refurbished Titan 2
intercontinental ballistic missiles to be used as a space booster.
The missiles were originally deployed in silos in Arkansas, Kansas
and Arizona in the 1960s, but were removed because of corrosion and
other aging problems.
   The Air Force decided to refurbish Titan 2 as space boosters
because it was cheaper than building new rockets.
   On Monday, Payne called the Titan 2 liftoff ``a spectacular
launch with all systems operating as expected,'' but said officials
would not know for two to three days whether the payload achieved
its intended polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South
poles.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. A source close to the project, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the satellite failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit when the rocket's upper stage
failed to re-ignite. He said there was little hope of salvaging
that mission.

   An advanced navigation satellite
circled Earth today, boosted into orbit on the inaugural liftoff of
the Delta 2, the first of the post-Challenger space rockets
developed to launch vital military payloads.
   ``It was in every way a picture perfect launch,'' Air Force Lt.
Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, said after Tuesday's
successful liftoff. ``The satellite came up very strong and we're
receiving a good signal.''
   The Delta 2 is the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the
Pentagon is ordering in a $14 billion program to launch much-needed
reconnaissance, navigation, communications and other national
security satellites.
   About 40 of these payloads have been grounded for lack of a
launch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded three years
ago, killing seven astronauts.
   As a result of the accident, the Air Force decided it was a
mistake to abandon unmanned rockets and to use the shuttle for sole
access to space. It ordered three new rocket systems, the
medium-size Delta 2 and Atlas 2 and the large, more powerful Titan 4.
   The Delta 2 was the first to fly. On its debut, it carried into
orbit the $65 million Navstar Global Positioning satellite, the
first payload removed from the shuttle manifest to a throwaway
rocket.
   The satellite entered an initial elliptical orbit ranging from
about 100 to 11,000 miles above Earth. On Thursday, an on-board
motor will be fired to shift the satellite into a circular orbit of
about 11,000 miles high.
   The 3,675-pound satellite is an advanced version of of seven
earlier model Navstars currently in orbit. It will enable U.S. and
allied military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks to
locate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel.
The accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet.
   The satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded Navstars the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving
anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning
information.
   The original plan was to launch all 21 on NASA's space shuttle
fleet. But that idea was scrapped after the Challenger explosion.
Now, only two remain scheduled on the shuttle.
   The Air Force has ordered 20 Delta 2s from McDonnell Douglas, 23
Titan 4s from Martin Marietta and 11 Atlas 2s from General Dynamics.
It is negotiating for 26 more Titan 4s.
   The Titan 4 is scheduled to make its first flight next month. The
Atlas 2 debut is set for next year.

<HEAD>Back to Expendable Rockets, Following Challenger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years ago, while space shuttles were
making regular satellite-delivery runs into orbit, the Air Force
began agitating for a return to rocket launches in case something
went wrong with the shuttle fleet.
   Something did go horribly wrong _ Challenger _ and the space
program is back where it started 30 years ago, using expendable
rockets.
   Edward C. Aldridge, then undersecretary of the Air Force,
sounded the warning before Congress in 1984.
   ``We simply cannot afford to be in a situation, whatever the
view on its likelihood, that could result in our being denied all
access to space,'' he said. ``The Department of Defense must not be
totally dependent on the shuttle ... We feel that having our total
launch capability placed on the shuttle is an unacceptable risk.''
   Aldridge's testimony was the capstone of a furious fight with a
sister agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
which contended that the Air Force was trying to undermine the
civilian shuttle program by pushing for a return to large,
expensive, ``expendable launch vehicles'' to put military
satellites in orbit. The space agency all along had counted on the
military to be its paying customer on at least one-third of all
flights.
   Aldridge, now secretary of the Air Force, got his ELVs. His
warnings proved to be prophetic when the Challenger blew up on Jan.
28, 1986. Because of his efforts, an assembly line was starting to
put an improved version of the Air Force's workhorse Titan rocket
together.
   Like all disasters, the space program's came in threes. On April
18, a Titan 34-D exploded five seconds after launch with a secret
military payload and on May 3, a Delta, carrying a $57 million
weather satellite, had to be destroyed when it veered out of
control. The United States was left with no capacity to launch
heavy payloads.
   With the shuttle fleet grounded for nearly three years and
expensive satellites sitting in warehouses with no place to go, the
expendable launch vehicle industry had a slow rebirth.
   President Reagan ordered NASA out of the commercial launching
business; the Air Force began spending billions to restore an ELV
fleet that was all but depleted; owners of satellites with no way
to orbit began booking rides with the European consortium
Arianespace; and both China and the Soviet Union began soliciting
launch business.
   As of July 23, Arianespace has contracts to launch 40 satellites
for $2.3 billion, including 7 from the United States and more than
a dozen from other countries and international organizations that
previously used American launch vehicles.
   For years, the United States had encouraged development of a
private launch industry, but not a single customer had been signed.
In the new climate, the big three rocket builders suddenly got into
the buiness of selling satellite deliveries as a package deals:
rocket and launch for one price, discounts available for two or
more.
   ``There has been a resurgence in this industry,'' said Fred
Bettinger of General Dynamics, which makes Atlas-Centaur and Atlas
2 rockets. General Dynamics has 18 Atlas-Centaurs on its assembly
line _ although only four are sold for $50 million to $60 million
each; it has orders for 11 Atlas 2s through 1997 for $856 million.
   McDonnell Douglas has a major share of the Air Force ELV
buildup. The Air Force has ordered 14 Delta 2s for $493.8 million
and has options for six more for a total $690 million. In addition,
said McDonnell Douglas' Tom Williams, the company began to market
the Deltas commercially and has seven orders through 1991.
   ``Two years ago we were going out of business in the area of
ELVs,'' Williams said. ``That was before the Reagan administration
revived the ELV business.
   ``During that vacuum when Challenger crashed and before our ELV
business was resurrected, Arianespace cleaned up, securing many
contracts. The balance has been redressed especially this year. We
landed four contracts in 1987 and three this year.''
   Among McDonnell Douglas commercial customers are British
Satellite Broadcast Limited, the governments of India and
Indonesia, NATO and two for Inmarsat.
   Martin Marietta has contracts for $5.5 billion worth of its
Titan rockets and their launches _ three different launch vehicles
for Air Force and commercial customers.
   ``What really gave us the impetus to start our commercial Titan
business was the presidential decision to take commercial payloads
off the shuttle,'' said Judy Herb, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman in
Denver. ``We announced within days of that that we had formed the
Commercial Titan Co.''
   The firm is marketing a version of the Titan 3 _ an Air Force
standby since the 1960s _ as the Commercial Titan, and has sold
four at $100 million to $125 million each for launches through
early 1990. It also has an agreement with General Electric to
launch up to 15 satellites over a number of years, all on the
Commercial Titan.
   The Titan 2, a refurbished Intercontinental Ballistics Missile
was launched for the first time this month (September) and there
are 13 more on order for $638.7 million.
   The newest and biggest of the line, the Titan 4, is on a pad at
the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida for launch in
October. It has the greatest lift capacity of any American rocket,
being able to put a 10,000-pound satellite into orbit 22,300 miles
above Earth.
   Twenty-two more Titan 4s are on order, bringing the price tag to
$4.2 billion through 1993 and the Air Force has just announced its
intention to buy 20 more of the behemoths.
   An irony is that NASA, which fought ELVs so long as a threat to
the manned space flight program, now is standing in line to buy
them from the Air Force.
   In 1984, Aldridge called an ELV capacity ``a modest hedge
against unanticipated and unforeseen shuttle problems which might
cause fleet groundings or outages.'' In 1988 NASA tends to agree.

   High-altitude winds forced a
postponement Sunday of the launch the Air Force's new Delta 2 space
rocket with an advanced navigation satellite.
   The postponement was announced just 13 minutes before the planned
liftoff after balloon data showed that shear winds several miles
above the launch pad were too high for the rocket to pass through
safely.
   ``We have scrubbed the launch of the Navstar mission because of
the upper level wind conditions,'' Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force
launch commentator reported. Wind velocities were not reported.
   The launch was rescheduled for 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.
   Rand said a two-day delay was needed to provide rest for the
launch team.
   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 is to carry into space a $65
million Navstar satellite that will enable NATO military users such
as ships, planes, trucks and tanks to locate their positions within
50 feet. The accuracy for civilian users will be 300 feet.
   The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the Delta 1, which has
logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first of
three new space boosters the Air Force ordered built to carry
national security payloads after the space shuttle Challenger
explosion in 1986.
   The grounding of the shuttle fleet and the Titan 34D rocket, also
after a 1986 failure, has left the Pentagon with a backlog of about
40 reconnaissance, communications, navigation and other military
satellites to be launched.
   The new Titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month,
with the Atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch.
   The Navstar satellite, orbiting 11,000 miles up, is to join seven
earlier model Navstars already on patrol. The Air Force goal is a
constellation of 21 of the upgraded payloads in orbit by 1992 to
provide total global coverage.

   An advanced navigation satellite was
propelled into orbit Tuesday by the Air Force's new Delta 2 rocket,
a 128-foot-tall booster developed after the Challenger disaster to
carry vital military payloads.
   The three-stage $30 million rocket roared off its launch pad on
schedule at 1:30 p.m. and the Air Force reported 30 minutes later
that it had released the satellite into an initial elliptical orbit
ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles high.
   ``The spacecraft separation occurred on time and everything looks
fine'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.
   On Thursday an onboard motor will fire to shift the satellite
into a circular orbit in which both the high and low points will be
about 11,000 miles high.
   The launch was postponed Sunday just 13 minutes before the
planned liftoff after balloon data showed that winds several miles
above the launch pad were too strong for the rocket to pass through
safely.
   Rand reported the winds today had shifted to a more favorable
direction and had calmed.
   Aboard the Delta 2 for its maiden flight was a $65 million
Navstar Global Position System payload that will enable U.S. and
allied military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks to
locate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel.
The accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet.
   The satellite, which contains an atomic clock with an error rate
of one second every 300,000 years, was designed to provide
information on longitude, latitude and altitude.
   The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the Delta 1, which has
logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first of

A section of a Titan 4 rocket booster fell off a crane and burst into flames
Friday at a testing laboratory here, leaving one worker missing and presumed
dead, injuring nine others and sending a mushroom-shaped cloud of smoke
thousands of feet into the air, officials said.

The Titan 4, the largest unmanned space booster being developed by the Air
Force, is designed to carry almost as much payload into orbit as the space
shuttle and was intended to free the military from its dependency on the
troubled shuttle program. But the Titan program, which costs $200 million per
launch, is over budget and behind schedule and also has been plagued with
malfunctions and other problems.
</P>
<P>
After the fire broke out, hospitals throughout the Antelope Valley were put on
alert to prepare for patients from the base, but the casualty toll by late
Friday held at nine injured, including one who suffered chemical burns and
another whose elbow was fractured. Five workers were treated for smoke
inhalation and released.
</P>
<P>
Names of the victims were not disclosed, but officials said three were believed
to be civilian workers employed by an aerospace contractor.
</P>
<P>
One worker was still missing late Friday. Lt. Col. Jan Dalby said the base's
disaster response team was searching for him. But, he added, "We assume that he
is dead."
</P>
<P>
Some damage to surrounding buildings was also reported. The intense fire curled
the metal siding on some structures, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10:45 a.m. as the rocket booster was being moved at
the base's Astronautics Laboratory. It forced several hundred employees to be
evacuated from the facility, a 65-square-mile complex north of the base's Test
Flight Center and known as "The Rock."
</P>
<P>
Mechanics said sections of the 112-foot rocket booster were being moved to an
outdoor test stand where they would be further assembled. The procedure, called
"stacking," involves attaching the first and second stages to the bottom,
largest section.
</P>
<P>
As the bottom section of one solid-fuel booster was being hoisted to the stand
by a 900-ton crane, it became dislodged and fell 100 feet, igniting upon
impact, Air Force Maj. Dick Cole said.
</P>
<P>
The piece that fell and caught on fire is the motor unit section of a Titan
Advanced Solid Rocket booster, Air Force spokesmen said. Two such solid-fuel
boosters are strapped to the sides of the middle section, or "core vehicle," of
a Titan 4 rocket and used to give the rocket initial liftoff. The liquid-fueled
core vehicle, which carries the payload, then fires shortly after the boosters
separate.
</P>
<P>
The segment that toppled from the crane was being tested to determine whether
the Air Force wanted to purchase additional units, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
The crane, which stood more than 100 feet tall and could be seen for miles
around, fell onto concrete blocks at the test stand. Air Force officials said
the missing worker may be buried under the rubble, complicating recovery of the
body.
</P>
<P>
"All I could see was that the crane fell over and a bunch of smoke went up,"
said David Calta, a civil engineer who works at the Astronautics Laboratory.
"(The crane) was like the landmark around here. It's visible from quite a
distance and now it's not there anymore."
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials emphasized the booster component did not explode but
produced a sudden, large "flash fire."
</P>
<P>
"It looked much like fireworks from the Fourth of July when you have a
sparkler," Ranney Adams, a spokesman for the Astronautics Laboratory, said.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting accounts from witnesses, some of whom reported hearing a
blast and others who did not.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a small boom and the next thing I know they were telling us to get
out," said a mechanic working at the base who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The security police said, 'Ladies and gentlemen get off The Rock. Now!' "
</P>
<P>
The mechanic said there was a massive tie-up of cars leaving the base, and at
least five ambulances passed him, going toward the lab.
</P>
<P>
Though the cloud of smoke, which billowed several thousand feet into the air,
contained trace amounts of potentially toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric
acid, Air Force officials said it at no time posed a threat to surrounding
communities in the sparsely populated desert area. It wafted northward, then
dissipated, but could be seen up to 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
No nuclear-delivery system was involved in the accident, officials said.
</P>
<P>
As the cloud drifted, the California Highway Patrol closed a 30-mile stretch of
California 58 as a precaution. The road was opened about 40 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a thunderhead, a big plume of smoke curling into the air," said
a mechanic who works in a nearby laboratory. "Oh jeez, it was a half-mile in
diameter. I have never seen anything like that."
</P>
<P>
He added that workers were alerted to the emergency by an alarm system.
</P>
<P>
"I never heard any noise or explosion," he said. "I was in another building.
They came over the alert system saying, 'We have a major emergency, all haz mat
(hazardous material) and rescue teams go to your posts. This is not a drill. We
have an emergency on hand.' "
</P>
<P>
Two inspectors from Cal/OSHA, the state job safety agency, arrived at the test
site Friday afternoon. Officials from the Air Force Space Division, which
oversees the Astronautics Laboratory, were also expected to join an
investigation of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) also urged the Pentagon to investigate, saying the
accident may have exposed "unknown deficiencies in Air Force procedures for
moving, storing and installing" Titan 4 components.
</P>
<P>
Edwards, located in the western Mojave Desert about 100 miles north of Los
Angeles, is home of the Air Force Flight Test Center, the country's premier
aerospace test and research facility. Nearly every aircraft in the Air Force
inventory over the last 45 years has been tested and evaluated by the Air Force
Flight Test Center, which is 17 miles south of the Astronautics Laboratory
where Friday's accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Astronautics Laboratory, the largest tenant at Edwards, represents the
space and missile arm of the Air Force. With a 1989 budget of $137 million, it
is charged with conducting advanced research and development involving space
systems and rocket propulsion technologies, including solid propellant rocket
motors.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4 is the newest and largest unmanned space booster being developed by
Air Force Systems Command's Space Division. Built by the Martin Marietta Corp.,
it is designed to carry payloads equivalent in size and weight to those carried
by the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Past Titan rockets have carried spy payloads. The first was launched on June
14, 1989, boosting what analysts said was either a missile-warning satellite or
an electronic eavesdropping satellite. The second Titan 4, worth $173 million,
was launched June 8 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., carrying a secret surveillance
satellite into orbit.
</P>
<P>
Ten launches were planned during 1990-91, but six were postponed because of
delays in preparing launch sites and taking delivery of the rockets. As of
June, the Air Force said it planned two more Titan 4 launches this year.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also has said it plans to launch 10 Titan 4s annually by 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force initially planned to build only 10 Titan 4s to complement the
space shuttle as a way to launch heavy payloads. But the 1986 explosion that
destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed seven crew members prompted the
Pentagon to decide to obtain many more.
</P>
<P>
Two Titan 34D rockets, the immediate predecessor to the Titan 4, failed during
launch attempts at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1985 and '86. Also in 1986, a
Titan 34D exploded at Vandenberg, injuring 58 people.

   Atlantis lit up the sky in a rare
launch in darkness Thursday as it streaked into orbit on a secret
military mission that reportedly will send a satellite to spy on
Iraq.
   The shuttle thundered from its oceanside launch pad at 6:48 p.m.
EST, trailed by a 700-foot-pillar of flame. On board were five
astronauts who will deploy the satellite during the flight.
   Mission control's Jeff Carr described the launch as ``picture
perfect, absolutely no anomalies to report.'' He said the mission
commander described the liftoff as ``spectacular.''
   ``This was really just about as smooth a count and liftoff and
early few minutes of a mission as I've ever seen,'' said NASA
Administrator Richard Truly.
   The 100-ton spaceship was visible for miles as it rocketed into
the nighttime sky.
   It was the fifth after-dark launch in 37 shuttle flights. It
also was NASA's fifth launch for 1990 and the seventh and probably
last Pentagon mission to be shrouded in secrecy.
   Two minutes into the flight, Atlantis' two solid fuel rockets
burned out and dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. The shuttle reached
an undisclosed orbit 6{ minutes later on the thrust of its three
main liquid fuel engines, and all public communications with the
craft were cut off.
   Throughout the day, high crosswinds and low clouds threatened to
delay the launch, but the weather improved. The countdown also was
unaffected by a last-minute problem with a unit at the launch pad
used to cool the shuttle.
   A news blackout has been imposed on Atlantis' four-day flight,
during which the astronauts will deploy a satellite that sources
said is to spy on Iraq. Experts believe it is either a photographic
imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft.
   Atlantis carried a spy satellite into orbit during its last
flight in March.
   The shuttle's all-military crew, commanded by Air Force Col.
Richard Covey, has been waiting for months to fly this mission. The
flight was scheduled for July but was delayed indefinitely when
Atlantis was found during a fueling test in June to have dangerous
hydrogen leaks.
   It was the second shuttle to be crippled by leaking hydrogen.
Columbia's astronomy mission was scrubbed in May when the spaceship
sprang leaks during fueling.
   ``We finally got there, fixed the leaks, which is again a
testimony to the team,'' said launch director Bob Sieck. ``We do
find problems, they do occur. But we fix them, and we'll get on
with what we're supposed to do which is flying these machines
safely and successfully.''
   During the grounding, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration replaced Atlantis' external fuel tank, plumbing
between the orbiter and tank, and valve seals. In addition,
Atlantis' military cargo reportedly was modified for gathering
information in the Persian Gulf.
   Atlantis, like Columbia, was cleared for flight during a fueling
test last month.
   NASA set a Nov. 9 launch date for Atlantis, but the Air Force
delayed that mission because of undisclosed cargo problems. That
trouble quickly was resolved, clearing the way for Thursday's
liftoff attempt.
   Also on the crew are Navy Cmdr. Frank Culbertson Jr., pilot; and
Army Capt. Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade and Marine
Col. Robert Springer, all mission specialists.
   The Pentagon has imposed a news blackout on the flight similar
to its six previous missions. Because of the expense in maintaining
secure operations, officials said this would be the last military
shuttle mission to be conducted in secrecy.
   The Pentagon plans to use the shuttle two more times in 1991,
but the cargoes in each instance will be unclassified. Military
officials will rely on unmanned rockets - primarily the giant Titan
4 - to carry other payloads into orbit.
   So far, the Air Force has sent up three Titan 4 rockets, the
most powerful unmanned launcher in the United States. The third one
blasted off Monday night from Cape Canaveral.
   Air Force Col. Frank Stirling, who heads the Titan 4 program,
said a fleet of unmanned rockets will offer greater reliability
than NASA's shuttle.
   ``We had in a sense committed all our resources for space access
to one program, the space shuttle with only four orbiters,''
Stirling said.
   ``With Titan we have a continuing production line with many
Titans available so that if we should ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.

   Europe and the United States plan to send a space
probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one
with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space
Agency announced Friday.
   The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas-shrouded satellite
would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to
test soil from the mysterious moon.
   The mission, to be called the Cassini-Titan probe, was chosen
from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday
and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.
   NASA, however, still is seeking official approval for the $550
million project. It is expected to ask Congress for some funding
during the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, NASA spokesman
Charles Redmond said in Washington.
   Redmond said he expects the Europeans would contribute about $100
million to $150 million. They proposed paying for at least one major
instrument system, helping to pay for some others and providing
propulsion components.
   The project is named after 17th-century Italian astronomer
Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
   Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a thick,
organic-rich nitrogen atmosphere. The surface temperature is about
minus 354 degrees.
   Scientists believe that the chemical processes in Titan's
atmosphere may resemble those at work on the primitive Earth before
the origin of life.
   Cassini-Titan is to be launched in April 1996 by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and should arrive in the Saturn
system in October 2002, the European Space Agency said in a
statement.
   Saturn and its system of rings and satellites were briefly
encountered in 1980-81 during the United States' Voyager 1 and 2
missions.
   The Cassini-Titan mission will place around Saturn a NASA-built
orbiter that will send an European-built probe into Titan's
atmosphere. The probe is to slow down to subsonic speeds when it
gets within 110 miles of the moon.
   The probe is named Huygens, after the Dutch astronomer and
physicist Christian Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1656.
   A parachute system will be deployed to allow a slow descent to
the surface of Titan, which some scientists say is covered by ethane
and methane lakes or oceans. The low-velocity impact may be soft
enough to allow analysis of a surface sample before the probe dies,
the European Space Agency said.
   During the descent of Huygens, the orbiter will be used as a
radio relay station to transmit the probe's data to Earth. After
Huygen's mission, the Cassini orbiter is to circle Saturn for four
years at an altitude of only 620 miles.

   Space Shuttle Atlantis was moved to
the launch pad Wednesday for a flight late this month in which the
crew will deploy a Pentagon intelligence-gathering satellite and try
to determine man's role as a military observer in orbit.
   Perched vertically atop a huge transporter with a tank-like
tread, Atlantis headed out of an assembly building into the darkness
shortly after 1 a.m., completing the snail's-pace, four-mile trip
seven hours later at Launch Pad 39B.
   The move, befitting the classified nature of the mission, was
made without the floodlights, music, speeches and cheers of
thousands of workers who showed up when Discovery rolled to the pad
July 4 for the first shuttle mission since the 1986 Challenger
explosion that killed seven astronauts.
   Discovery returned Americans to space Sept. 29 and successfully
completed its mission four days later.
   Conrad Nagel, Atlantis' processing director, said NASA was aiming
for a launch Nov. 28 or 29. A firm date won't be set until after a
flight readiness review Nov. 16.
   Nagel's team began readying Atlantis in March 1987 for its third
journey into space, making more than 200 modifications to improve
the spacecraft's safety and performance.
   ``We are simply clean as far as any technical problems,'' he told
reporters Wednesday.
   Atlantis will have a crew of five, headed by Navy Cmdr. Robert
Gibson. The others are Air Force Lt. Col. Guy Gardner, Air Force Lt.
Col. Jerry Ross, Air Force Col. Richard Mullane and Navy Cmdr.
William Shepherd.
   The astronauts will deploy a satellite, believed to carry
instruments to intercept electronic signals and verify arms control
agreements, and conduct other experiments of a military nature.
   The Air Force has been planning several experiments for upcoming
shuttle flights to determine the utility of astronauts for strategic
reconnaissance, surveillance of Soviet naval forces and other
operational military objectives.
   The tests will be coordinated with with ground exercises,
including troop maneuvers, naval movements and ballistic missile
launches. It is not known publicly which of the exercises will be
conducted on the upcoming mission because the Defense Department has
thrown a cloak of secrecy over most details.
   Officials have said the launch will occur between 6:32 a.m. and
9:32 a.m., but the time won't be made public until the countdown
reaches nine minutes before liftoff.
   Once Atlantis is safely in orbit, there will be a news blackout,
except for a brief announcement every 24 hours saying the shuttle is
still up there. That plan will be broken only if something serious
goes wrong. Sixteen hours' advance notice will be given of the
landing.
   Two more Defense Department shuttle flights and seven unmanned
Titan launches are planned in the next year as the Pentagon aims to
start moving into space a backlog of more than 20 payloads grounded
by the Challenger accident and the explosion of a Titan rocket three
months later.

   Space shuttle Discovery will lift
off after dark on a secret Thanksgiving week military mission, the
first of three dazzling nighttime launches scheduled here in four
weeks.
   NASA announced the Nov. 20 Discovery launch date Tuesday after
shuttle managers concluded a two day-review that assessed the
readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the global tracking network
and all other aspects of the mission.
   The space agency said the liftoff would occur during a four-hour
period starting at 6:30 p.m., only the third night launch in 32
shuttle flights. The precise time will not be made public until
nine minutes before launch to make it harder for Soviet
reconnaissance ships to track the shuttle.
   Martin Marietta also announced Tuesday that it will launch the
first commercial payloads on its huge Titan 3 rocket on the night
of Dec. 8. They will be communications satellites for Japan and
Great Britain.
   NASA earlier announced the scheduled after-dark launch of space
shuttle Columbia on Dec. 18, to deploy a communications satellite
and to track down and return to Earth a science satellite that has
been in orbit more than five years.
   The late Discovery and Titan launches are necessary to place the
satellites in desired orbits. The Columbia liftoff is timed to put
the shuttle on course to intercept the satellite to be retrieved.
   While Discovery's crew is scheduled to be in space on
Thanksgiving, Columbia's 10-day mission will have its astronauts in
orbit on Christmas.
   The trio of night launches should provide a brilliant fireworks
display for rocket watchers for hundreds of miles around.
   When Atlantis lifted off on the last shuttle night mission in
November, 1985, its 700-tail of fire was clearly visible from Key
West, Fla., to Georgia, and in Fort Myers, 150 miles away on
Florida's southwest coast.
   Discovery's payload on the Nov. 20 flight will be a $300
million, 2{-ton satellite for monitoring Soviet missile tests and
eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications, said
reliable sources who requested anonymity. Another team of Discovery
astronauts launched a similar satellite in 1985.
   The crew for the upcoming mission is: Air Force Col. Frederick
C. Gregory, the commander; Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot;
and mission specialists Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F. Story
Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pioneering space probe suggested
Saturn's largest moon might be covered with an ocean of liquid
natural gas, but scientists who bounced radar off its surface say it
may have some dry land or an icy surface.
   ``We interpret our results to mean that the surface of Titan is
highly variable,'' planetary scientist Duane O. Muhleman said in an
announcement issued Monday by the California Institute of Technology.
   Titan, nearly twice as massive as Earth's moon, is one of only
three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres. The
others are Jupiter's moon Io and Neptune's moon Triton.
   Data from Voyager 1 in 1980 suggested that methane and ethane,
components of natural gas, condense in Titan's mostly nitrogen
atmosphere and rain on the surface, leading some scientists to
believe Titan might be covered by up to a mile of liquid ethane and
methane.
   Muhleman and his colleagues bounced 360,000-watt radar signals
off Titan during three 5{-hour periods on June 3, 4 and 5.
   An ethane-methane ocean would have low reflectivity, creating
weak radar echoes. Instead, they found strong radar echoes during
one observation period and weak echoes during the other two while
Titan rotated on its axis. That suggests Titan has oceans in some
places and a solid surface in others.

   The Air Force said Saturday it will
launch a Delta 2 rocket Sunday with a military navigation
satellite, taking priority over the flight of a commercial Titan 3
booster with two foreign satellites.
   The Titan 3 liftoff was postponed Thursday night by a computer
software problem and Friday night by stormy weather. The launch was
to mark the entry of Martin Marietta into the commercial launch
business.
   Company officials said Saturday that other launches planned at
Cape Canaveral over the next nine days have priority, so the Titan
3 can't be launched until at least Dec. 20.
   However, they said if one of the other rockets is delayed, the
Titan 3 could move up. The rocket is to carry communications
satellites for a Japanese company and Britain's Ministry of Defense.
   The Delta launch from another pad was set for 12:58 p.m. EST
with the launch window extending until 1:19 p.m. The rocket carries
the fourth in a series of Navstar satellites that enable U.S. and
allied military forces to pinpoint their location anywhere on Earth
within 50 feet.
   Other pending launches are those of a Trident 2 military missile
from the submarine USS Tennessee during the coming week and space
shuttle Columbia on Dec. 18.
   Columbia's five astronauts are to deploy a Navy communications
satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to Earth a
science payload that has been orbiting the globe for nearly six
years.

   Hercules Inc. shares plunged in hectic trading after the
explosion Monday of a rocket engine booster considered
crucial to the future of the company's troubled aerospace
division.
   The explosion of the Titan IV engine booster in its first
test firing raises serious doubts about Hercules' engine
project, securities analysts said. At best, it delays the
engine program by several months. At worst, it could lead to
the entire four-year-old project being scrapped, analysts
speculated.

   Despite the broad advance in stock prices yesterday
Hercules shares plunged $5.25 to close at $36 on volume of
2.9 million shares. Initially, the stock fell $7.25 to $34,
or more than 17%, after a delayed opening caused by a flood
of sell orders. More than 1% of the shares outstanding
changed hands at that price, the day's low, in a single block
of 500,000 shares.
   "Obviously, it's a set back for the company," said George
Krug, a securities analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New
York. Robert Hessler, a spokesman for the Wilmington, Del.,
company, said it was "impossible to speculate" what impact
the explosion will have on Hercules' contract to develop and
produce the rocket booster.
   Shares of Martin Marietta Corp., the major contractor for
the Titan IV project, slid $1.625 to $54.875.
   There were no injuries in the explosion, which the Air
Force said it has appointed a panel to investigate.
   Some investors may have recently accumulated Hercules
stock as a bet on a successful test of the engine booster.
Several analysts sent out optimistic reports on the company
after company Chairman Thomas Gossage, according to one
analyst, said recently that he was "optimistic, but not
overly confident" about the test.
   One analyst warned in February that a failed engine test
"could be devastating for the Titan program and Hercules'
role in it." But he added, "risk-oriented investors may wish
to be aggressive in accumulating the stock since a normal
Titan test would likely propel the stock to new heights."
   The explosion is also the latest setback for the U.S.
space program. The solid fuel engine is designed to boost by
25% the payload unmanned rockets can carry into earth orbit
to accommodate the Air Force's need for heavier, more
sophisticated spy satellites. The Air Force had hoped to
launch a satellite using the booster next year.
   The explosion at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern
California occurred at 4:17 p.m. EST, shortly after the close
of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. A firing
stand used in the test was also heavily damaged by the
explosion.
   The test was to be the first of five. Due to the damage to
the firing stand, it is likely to be many months before
another test can take place, the Hercules spokesman said.
   Charles Gunn, the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration's director of unmanned launch vehicles, said
he didn't believe that the Titan IV problems would affect the
space agency because NASA doesn't plan to use the rocket
until the end of 1995. He estimates that the Air Force will
have launched a dozen Titan IVs with the upgraded booster by
that time and corrected the problems.
   Hercules' aerospace unit took $323 million in write-offs
in 1989, more than $200 million of which were directly
attributable to the Titan IV engine. The unit continued to
stumble last year, when it "experienced technical and
operational setbacks," according to the 1990 annual report.

   The Air Force's powerful new Titan 4
rocket will carry a huge new missile-warning satellite when it
blasts off on its maiden flight next month, an industry magazine
reported Friday.
   Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology said the 5,200-pound satellite
is the third generation of Defense Support Program payloads designed
to give the United States instant alert of a missile attack.
   The magazine said in a report to be published in its Feb. 20
issue that nine of the new DSP satellites, costing $180 million
each, will be launched over the next several years.
   It said the satellite has an advanced infrared telescope to
detect the heat exhaust of a missile rising after launch from land
or sea.
   While missile warning is the payload's primary role, Aviation
Week said the satellite also will provide intelligence on routine
Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and space launches.
   It also is expected to be able to detect the heat from military
aircraft when they fly with their afterburners on for higher speed.
   The magazine said the satellite has new survivability features,
including a system to protect it from ground-based lasers.
   Thirteen early model DSP satellites have been launched by the Air
Force since 1971.
   The Titan 4, the largest of three rocket systems the Air Force
ordered to lessen its dependency on NASA's space shuttle after the
1986 Challenger explosion, is scheduled for launch in mid-March.

<HL> McDonnell Douglas Gains Strong Hold
In Space Industry on Big Rocket Order

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. has suddenly become a major factor in the commercial space industry as a result of the Air Force's decision to order as many as 20 unmanned Delta II rockets.

   Industry officials say the economies of scale made possible by the Air Force purchase should give McDonnell Douglas a strong base for establishing a commercial launch business for space satellites.
Its principal competitor will be European Ariane rockets, although two other U.S. companies said they may still try to enter the field.

   "We think we may be in a position to drive the whole market," a McDonnell Douglas official says.
He cites an Air Force study forecasting that the Delta II could capture as much as 70% of the current backlog in space satellites.

   Analysts, meanwhile, say the price of the Delta II rockets in the Air Force order indicates that McDonnell Douglas could compete on a solid footing with European and other foreign competitiors.

   The $669.3 million contract is a product of the recovery plan drawn up by the Air Force last year after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the failure of an Air Force Delta rocket.
The new launch vehicles will be used to carry medium-weight payloads into orbit.
The Air Force intends to use its Delta IIs to launch global navigation satellites that initially were scheduled for launching on the shuttle.

   To help defray costs, the Air Force order requires McDonnell Douglas to develop a version of the rocket designed to reestablish a commercial launch industry in the U.S. Industry sources say there currently is a backlog of about 30 to 45 commercial satellites awaiting launch.

   Both General Dynamics Corp., which makes the Atlas rocket, and Martin Marietta Corp., producer of the Titan rocket, say they will reevaluate their programs after losing out to McDonnell Douglas in the Air Force competition.
Each, however, indicates a continuing interest in entering the commercial market.
"Obviously the Air Force decision was a major setback," says a Martin Marietta official.
"But we think there is business out there for our product."

   The primary advantage of the Delta II apparently was a price tag that averaged $33 million for each in a full order of 20 rockets.
That compares with the estimated $100 million cost of the Martin Marietta Titan, which carries two satellites instead of the Delta II's one and is also capable of transporting larger payloads.
The General Dynamics bid also is understood to have been substantially higher than the one for Delta II.

   The European Ariane rocket can carry one large and one small satellite, costing approximately $80 million to $100 million, depending upon the specifications of the satellites, according to industry officials.
Aerospace specialists said the unit costs of a rocket program decline sharply as volume increases.

   The disadvantage of the Delta II is a smaller payload capacity than either the Titan, Atlas or Ariane.
"There are a number of satellites that are just too big for it to handle," one analyst says.

   McDonnell Douglas, however, believes that technology will help make satellites smaller and smaller.
"The market is moving more and more in our direction," an official says.

   For the next few years, aerospace executives say there should be more satellite business available than either the McDonnell Douglas or the European Ariane program can handle.
U.S. officials believe the Ariane program is capable of launching a maximum of about 16 satellites a year, while McDonnell Douglas could begin launching as many as 12 rockets annually starting in late 1989 -- including seven Air Force payloads a year.

   A McDonnell Douglas official says the company plans to increase its launch capacity to 18 rockets by 1991.
Even so, analysts say that could leave as many as 10 other commercial satellites annually that could be launched by a third major competitor.

   A National Aeronautics and Space Administration official says that of the 25 satellites that had firm schedules to fly on the shuttle, only 10 are still slated for shuttle deployment.
The rest, he said, have been finding other rides -- including on proposed Chinese, Japanese and Russian launch vehicles.

   "The glut that has built up from the shuttle disaster will make it impossible for any launch program to satisfy demand in the next several years," says Louis C. Raburn, director of the Delta program at McDonnell Douglas.

   Martin Marietta Corp. lost a rocket contract earlier this year that was seen as the ticket to major sales in the fledgling business of launching commercial satellites.
But company officials say its commercial space business is about to lift off anyway.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. won the $669.3 million contract in January to build unmanned rockets for the Air Force.
The victory has already attracted a flurry of inquiries to the company from potential commercial customers.
But Martin Marietta has a $2.2 billion backlog of government orders for its large Titan rockets, giving it a stable production base on which to build a new commercial business.

   Indeed, Martin Marietta has already signed preliminary agreements with eight commercial customers to send 10 satellites into orbit on its Titan rockets, which in most cases can carry two satellites at a time.
The list includes three agreements completed after McDonnell Douglas received the Air Force award.

   Although the pacts represent only tentative commitments, Caleb B. Hurtt, Martin Marietta's executive vice president, predicts that Martin Marietta will soon start firming up its business.
"We expect definitive contracts in the very near future," he says.
"By the end of the year, we hope to have several."

   The company moved a step closer to that goal last week when the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, known as Intelsat, authorized its director general to sign a contract with Martin Marietta to launch two satellites.
The authorization is subject to resolution of certain launch-related issues.

   With the price tag for each Titan launch expected to exceed $100 million, Mr. Hurtt predicts that by the early 1990s, Martin Marietta's annual revenue from commercial satellite launches "could be about equal to" the $500 million in Titan military business that the company expects to have at that time.
For 1986, the aerospace and information systems concern had sales of $4.75 billion.

   The U.S. commercial space industry got its start after the space shuttle Challenger exploded last year.
As part of a recovery plan drawn up in the wake of the accident, the Air Force decided to order some expendable rockets, known as launch vehicles, to carry medium-weight navigational satellites that had been slated to fly on the shuttle.
McDonnell Douglas won the contract to build as many as 20 of its Delta rockets.
It also became a major factor in the new commercial space business because the Air Force also required it to develop a commercial version of its rocket that would compete with the European Ariane rocket program, among others.

   Industry sources say there is probably enough demand for at least two U.S. rocket manufacturers to enter the field.
They estimate that, in the wake of the shuttle disaster, about 30 to 45 satellites are awaiting launch.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is also expected to buy some unmanned rockets for its own use.

   But some analysts say demand might drop, since several telecommunications companies plan to install more fiber optic cable in the U.S. and around the world, reducing the need for communications satellites.

   Industry sources say the Air Force's choice of McDonnell Douglas's Delta rocket, rather than the Atlas that General Dynamics Corp. proposed building, is helping Martin Marietta's marketing efforts.

   McDonnell's Delta has a significantly smaller payload capacity than Martin Marietta's Titan, meaning it can carry far less weight into space.
The capacity of General Dynamics's Atlas, meanwhile, is closer to that of Martin Marietta's Titan.
This difference suggests that Martin Marietta would have faced a tougher competitor in the commercial market had the Air Force picked General Dynamics and given its Atlas a boost, some analysts say.

   For now, Martin Marietta's and McDonnell Douglas's vehicles are so different "they really don't compete for the same business," one industry source says.

   Indeed, Telesat Canada, the Ottawa-based operator of Canada's domestic satellite system, says McDonnell Douglas's Delta is too small to carry a heavy satellite the company plans to launch in 1990.
Telesat made a tentative reservation for a Titan launch by Martin Marietta, a Telesat spokeswoman says, but it also is considering launch proposals from the Europeans and the Chinese.

   General Dynamics says that, despite losing out on the Air Force contract, it is still seeking commercial customers.
But Alan Lovelace, a General Dynamics vice president, concedes that without a government contract to build its Atlas rockets, his company faces a difficult marketing challenge: It must line up customers one at a time in order to build "an economic base" that will allow it to go forward with production plans.

   "We have a number of companies that have indicated a desire to make reservations with us," Mr. Lovelace says.
But he says that the company hasn't yet signed any agreements.

   McDonnell Douglas, meanwhile, already has tentative launch agreements for seven commercial satellites owned by six customers.
"We've been swamped with requests since we won" the Air Force contract, a spokesman says.
"We're very optimistic."

   Martin Marietta officials also are excited about the Titan's propects.
The company expects to line up enough satellites for four to six commercial flights a year, starting in 1990, Mr. Hurtt says.
Its first commercial launch, expected in late 1989, is tentatively scheduled to carry a Federal Express Corp. satellite.

   Other customers that have tentative Titan reservations include the Hughes Communications Inc. unit of General Motors Corp.; Intelsat; the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization, a European consortium known as Eutelsat; and the Ford Aerospace unit of Ford Motor Co.

   "We are in an active marketing mode," Mr. Hurtt says.
"We don't have anybody telling us, 'Go away.
We hate you guys.'"

   Europe this week will launch its biggest, most
versatile rocket ever, which could give it an edge over the United
States and other countries in the race to commercialize space.
   Ariane-4, which is to blast off Wednesday from the European
Space Agency's space center in Kourou, French Guiana, was declared
ready for service on Saturday. Fueling of the rocket began Sunday.
   The new generation rocket is designed to serve as Europe's
``workhorse on the world launch services market until the end of
this century,'' according to officials at Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the 13-nation European Space Agency consortium.
   The rocket will on its inaugural launch carry an international
payload of three satellites into orbit, demonstrating the vehicle's
space readiness to potential customers.
   Capable of carrying heavier payloads than previous Arianes, the
rocket is the most sophisticated the Europeans have ever produced.
Its design allows engineers to strap on different configurations of
solid and liquid boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's
specific budget and needs, the agency said.
   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575 million,
Ariane-4 can carry a maximum load of 4.6 tons into orbit. Ariane-3,
the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8 tons.
   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloads.
As of May 25, the company held 67 launch contracts worth $3.4
billion.
   The United States and Japan have barely entered the race. But in
the coming years, Arianespace faces competition from the American
Titan-4 made by Martin Marietta Corp., Atlas-Centaur built by
General Dynamics and Delta made by McDonnell Douglas _ as well as
from the Soviet Proton, the Chinese Long March and the Japanese
H-2, now under development.
   The United States had been depending on its space shuttles as
the chief launchers of commercial satellites until Jan. 28, 1986,
when the shuttle Challenger exploded just after liftoff, killing
all seven crew members.
   There has not been a shuttle launch since. The next one is
expected late this summer.
   Even when the shuttles resume regular flights, their focus will
be on military and scientific missions, rather than commercial
operations.
   However, the Delta-2 will begin commercial flights this fall
with the Titan-3 scheduled to begin early next year. The
Atlas-Centaur is scheduled to take off with paying customers in the
middle of 1989.
   Previously, U.S. rockets lifted mostly military and scientific
loads under supervision of the U.S. Air Force or the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Arianespace officials consider the Titan rocket their toughest
competitor in the world market of about 25 launches a year. The
Titan is the only U.S. rocket able to haul satellites weighing more
than 2.7 tons.
   The main U.S. challenger may turn out to be the new Delta-2,
which will be bigger and more powerful than the current model.
   Arianespace plans to build and launch 70 of their new rockets
between now and 1995, when the Ariane-5 will be ready to fly.
   One of the three satellites due to be sent into space on
Wednesday, the Meteostat-P2, will be placed in orbit to furnish
weather data to 16 European countries.
   The 1,529-pound satellite will monitor weather over most of
Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of South
America. It replaces Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which until
recently sent back pictures of earth every half hour.
   The 330-pound Amsat-3C, known by the nickname Oscar-13, will
serve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.
   PAS-1, a satellite owned by the American telecommunications
company Pan American Satellite, will further telecommunications
service at a moderate cost between Latin America, the United States
and Europe.
   It also will provide some Latin American countries with the
ability to create national television networks.
