   Princess Diana, her two sons, mother and two
sisters flew to Antigua today for a weeklong vacation in the
Caribbean.
   Police and bodyguards kept photographers from taking pictures of
Diana, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4, as they boarded a
British Airways flight at Heathrow Airport.
   The princess and her children were traveling with her mother,
Frances Shand-Kydd, and sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady
Jane Fellowes.
   A spokesman at the Antigua and Barbuda High Commission in London,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the princess and her
family were headed for the island of Tortola in the British Virgin
Islands. Buckingham Palace said it could not confirm the report.
   ``This is a private holiday treat which Mrs. Shand-Kydd has
planned for quite some time,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman,
who by custom was not identified.
   During Diana's last holiday in the Caribbean, on the island of
Eleuthera, photographers snapped pictures of the princess as she
sunbathed in a bikini while pregnant with Prince William.
   Diana's husband, Prince Charles, remained at the estate of his
mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in Sandringham, where the royal family
celebrated the holidays.

<LEADPARA>  I HAVE never met the Queen of England, who visited the United States last
week, nor seen her in person. But on one occasion I almost knocked down her
mother, the Queen Mother.;    I was walking near St. Paul's Cathedral in
London, not particularly watching where I was going, when a limousine pulled
up to the curb and out stepped the ever-smiling Queen Mother, dainty in an
organdy dress and wide-brimmed hat.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Waving to the instant audience that gathered, she stepped onto the sidewalk
-- and I almost collided with her.;    That's the closest I've ever come to
meeting a member of the royal family, but it shows how accessible they are. If
I were determined enough, I could easily see -- if not meet -- every one of
the royals residing in London.;    Royals-watching is something like
star-watching. If you want to see a movie star in Hollywood, you go where they
are likely to appear.;    The same is true in London, only the palace makes it
easy: It publishes a monthly calendar listing the public appearances of the
royals. Among newspapers that print this list are the London Times, the
Telegraph and the Independent.;    Usually there's a royal appearance of one
kind or another every day. When I was in London a few years back, for
instance, the Duchess of York was to make a presentation at the Dulwich
Picture Galley at noon and attend an "Evening at the Races" at 7:55 p.m. at
the Savoy Hotel. Meanwhile, Princess Diana was to attend a preview of the
Chelsea Flower Show that evening.;    Such appearances are almost always
covered by London's headline-seeking tabloids, who are inveterate
royals-trackers. Some newspapers, like the Sun, have a full-time royals
reporter.;    For the general public, these appearances provide only a glimpse
of a royal personage as he or she moves from limousine to ceremony. For a more
candid -- and perhaps longer -- look at the royals, the thing to do is to hang
out at places where they are known to stay or visit.;    Prince Charles and
his family, for instance, live in London's Kensington Palace; a patient
royals-watcher may spot Princess Diana sending off sons Prince William and
Prince Henry to school in the mornings.;    Kensington Palace is also home to
several other members of the royal family, including Princess Margaret, the
Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and their three children, and Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent and their two children.;    The best place to spot
the royals at Kensington Palace is near the entrance on the side away from
Kensington Gardens Park, according to "Fodor's Royalty Watching," an excellent
guidebook that details the many places and events where the royals can be
seen.;    Unlike Buckingham Palace, where the Queen resides, parts of
Kensington Palace are open to the public. On display in the baroque state
apartments is a collection of court costumes.;    On the other hand, only the
Queen's Gallery and the Royal Mews are open to the public at stately
Buckingham Palace. The gallery displays some of the Queen's extraordinary
collection of paintings. In the mews, or stables, are the gilded state
coaches, including those used in coronations.;    Visitors also can watch the
changing-of-the-guard ceremony in the palace forecourt at 11 a.m. daily. It's
difficult to see much of this popular ritual because the heavy crowd cuts off
the view. Get there early or buy a periscope.;    The rest of the palace is
off-limits. In addition to the Queen, Buckingham is home to Prince Edward and
Princess Anne. Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York also stay here when in
town.;    It's possible to spot a royal or two coming and going at Buckingham,
but don't wait at the front gate; they use the side entrances.;    Most of the
royals also have homes outside London. Prince Charles' house in the Cotswolds
Hills is called Highgrove. Prince Andrew built a home in Sunninghill,
Berkshire, adjoining Windsor Great Park. Princess Anne has a place in Gatcombe
Park in Gloucestershire. The Queen has several castles, including Windsor and
Balmoral.;    Certain events bring out the royals. The royal enclosure at the
Royal Ascot races in June is always a good place to spot a crowned head or
two, as are the polo matches at nearby Smith's Lawn. Beware, however, of the
English tabloid photographers. They will elbow and jostle unmercifully just to
get a photo, as some of us found out one day when both Princess Diana and the
Duchess of York came to the polo matches attired in polka-dot outfits,
creating a photo frenzy.;    The Queen, of course, makes many public
appearances. One of the most colorful is the Trooping of the Color, a
celebration of the Queen's birthday held every year on the second Saturday in
June. She rides in a carriage. Other members of the royal family watch the
ceremony from the Horse Guards building.;    After the march, the Queen and
royal family gather on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a flyover by the
Royal Air Force. Camera-toting visitors equipped with a telephoto lens can
make their own souvenir photos of the royal family at this time.;    Now that
his broken arm has mended, Prince Charles is likely to resume playing polo at
Smith's Lawn, near the Ascot race course. Among the spectators may be his
father, the Duke of Edinburgh, or his wife, Princess Diana, though Di's
presence is becoming increasingly unlikely.;    Most royals watchers, however,
cherish the views they get of their distinguished targets during their less
public moments -- if, for instance, one happens to dine in the same restaurant
as Princess Diana, or spot Prince Andrew and the spirited Duchess of York in a
nightclub.;    These are chance occurrences, of course, since the royals do
not broadcast their private itineraries. But your chances of spotting a royal
are better if you visit the places where they are known to frequent.;    I
once missed seeing Princess Diana by just a day at Green's, a classy
restaurant on Duke Street in Mayfair. On a later visit there, I talked with
the manager, David Wicker.;    "Someone printed what she (Princess Diana)
dined on, so I got a letter from her lady-in-waiting, saying she was
displeased. But she's been here since." Wicker said people hardly turn their
heads when royal diners come in, and detectives don't let people approach
them.;    Other restaurants popular with members of the royal family include
Caprice, San Lorenzo, Mirabelle's, Belinsky's Balloon, Langan's Brasserie,
Annabel's Club (private), and the Clauserie in Claridge's Hotel.;    It's a
heady world the royals travel in, but it may not be as exciting as one might
think.;    A year or so ago in London, I saw a wonderful series of clips of
Princess Diana greeting person after person in a receiving line and becoming
progressively and utterly bored with it all.;    Which goes to show that for
all their pomp and circumstance, the royals are just as human as we commoners.  </TEXT>

   All, it would seem, was bliss at Buckingham Palace.
   Prince Charles and Diana emerged unscathed from a spate of rumors
about their marriage. Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, are happily
raising a baby. Prince Edward gave up military life and apparently
found peace with a theater company.
   Queen Elizabeth II was the picture of grandmotherly contentment.
   But now, suddenly, shocking headlines! Headstrong Princess Anne
and her shy commoner husband are splitting up. Is the British royal
family in trouble?
   Not really. It has survived worse crises, only to grow in
prestige and popularity. And compared with the scandals that beset
some of their ancestors, the separation announced Thursday of the
queen's daughter from Capt. Mark Phillips is small potatoes.
   ``Many, many royal marriages have been very unhappy indeed,''
says Michelle Brown, curator of the Royal Britain Exhibition.
``There have been lots of royal divorces in the past, and many
people far more miserable than Capt. Phillips and Princess Anne seem
to have been.''
   Like the unfortunate Sophia Dorothea, whose husband, George I,
locked her in a castle for 32 years for being unfaithful to him in
1694.
   Or, more recently, the drawn-out saga of Princess Margaret, the
queen's younger sister, whose marriage to Lord Snowdon ended in
divorce in 1978.
   And then there was 19th-century George IV, whose attempts to
divorce Caroline of Brunswick became a prolonged and disgraceful
public spectacle.
   Anne and Mark, who have two children, do not plan to divorce,
Buckingham Palace says.
   While most newspapers ran the split on the front page Friday, The
Independent ran just one paragraph on page 2. The Independent simply
doesn't believe the royals matter. Others enjoy them as soap opera.
   ``No scriptwriter could wish for a better cast,'' the columnist
Godfrey Smith has written: Queen Elizabeth II as ``everyone's
favorite mum,'' Prince Margaret the ``willful younger sister,''
Prince Philip ``the cantankerous father,'' ``interesting children
(cheerful Charlie, randy Andy, educated Edward and angular Anne),
all sorts of in-laws (divine Diana, problem-girl Princess Michael),
grandchildren galore...''
   There is, however, genuine sympathy for Anne.
   Her marriage in 1973 to Phillips, televised from Westminster
Abbey, was dubbed a storybook romance, but rested mainly on a shared
passion for horses, and marital strife has been rumored for eight
years.
   Anne's short temper and caustic tongue earned her an unpopular
image that only changed in the 1980s through her quiet, sustained
and often courageous work on behalf of the world's needy children.
   She may never rival Princess Diana in looks, and as seventh in
line to the throne she is unlikely to become Queen Anne. But she is
blessed with wit, poise and intellect, and at 39 she is by far the
most interesting of the British royals.
   ``We are very possessive about our royal family, and we were all,
in a sense, guests at that fairy-tale wedding 15 years ago,'' The
Times editorialized Friday. ``The queen's daughter has never been a
fairy-tale princess, however, and the monarchy is the stronger for
it.''
   Indeed, the line was taken by some newspapers that the marriage
was a sham, and that its end came as a relief.
   Other European countries also treasure their royals, and scandals
are far fewer. Belgium hasn't had any problems since King Leopold
III married a commoner in 1941 without his government's approval.
Holland's Princess Irene scandalized Protestants by converting to
Catholicism to marry a Spaniard, but her divorce 17 years later
barely caused a ripple. The Swedish and Danish royal families are
squeaky clean.
   So, for the most part, is the British family. But when it does
arise, divorce is always an emotional issue, from much-married Henry
VIII four centuries ago to Edward VIII, who had to abdicate in 1936
to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson.
   ``It was only since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert set up this
wonderful sort of epitome of the perfect family that the pressure
existed,'' curator Brown told London Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Before then, royal marriages had all the rough and tumble and
all the problems of any other marriage and nobody tried to pretend
otherwise.''

   Prince Charles on Monday hailed
Hungary's role in ``changing the face of Europe'' as he and
Princess Diana began the first official visit by members of
Britain's royal family to a Warsaw Pact country.
   The royal couple were met at the airport by their host, newly
elected interim President Arpad Goencz, the state MTI news agency
reported.
   During their four-day trip, the couple will meet with government
officials, business officials and artists.
   On Monday, Prince Charles visited Parliament, where he met
separately with Goencz, Premier Miklos Nemeth and Prime
Minister-designate Jozsef Antall, the leader of the center-right
Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   Last week, Hungary's new multiparty legislature met for the
first time and elected Goencz, a liberal writer jailed for six
years after the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising, as interim president.
   Antall, whose party gained the most seats in the March and April
elections _ the first freely contested since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948 _ was asked to form the next government.
He is seeking to form a center-right coalition with the like-minded
Independent Smallholders and the Christian Democrats.
   Nemeth formally submitted his Cabinet's resignation but it will
remain as a caretaker government until the new one is formed.
   Goencz presided over a gala dinner held for the royal duo Monday
night.
   At the dinner, Prince Charles said his great-great-great
grandmother, Countess Claudia Rhedey, was Hungarian.
   ``This evening I am especially proud of the Hungarian blood in
my veins,'' he said, according to MTI. He praised Hungary's role in
``changing the face of Europe'' with its early moves toward
political reforms.
   ``Making democracy work is never easy, but the effort is well
worth the bother,'' the prince said.
   Goencz said Hungary now has a ``unique opportunity ... to
irreversibly return to developed Europe,'' the news agency said.
   Upon arrival, their first stop was Heroes' Square, where they
placed a wreath at a monument in honor of Hungarian heroes.
   About 1,500 people gathered at the square. Many applauded as the
couple emerged from their car. The well-wishers included about 100
members of the British community in Budapest.
   ``I think the princess is beautiful,'' said Janos Nagy, a
21-year-old student. ``I have only seen pictures of her.''
   ``I came to see how she looks in real life,'' he said, tapping a
pair of binoculars.
   Amalia Roth, 67, with three grandchildren at her side, said she
had been to Britain before World War II as a young girl. ``I love
England and felt I must come,'' she said.
   The couple's schedule Tuesday included a speech by Prince
Charles at the University of Economics in Budapest. Princess Diana
is to view a display of British fashion at the Museum of Applied
Arts.
   The private jet taking Princess Diana to Hungary diverted to
Gatwick Airport shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport because
of an electrical fault, Buckingham Palace and airport officials
said.
   The four-engine jet of the Queen's Flight spent an hour and 20
minutes on the ground at Gatwick while the fault was repaired, said
Roger Hamson, terminal duty manager for Gatwick Airport. It then
left for Italy, where it picked up Charles before traveling to
Budapest.

   Princess Diana, who returned Friday from her
two-day visit to New York, won praise from British newspapers for
making it a success, but some said the city expected a combination
of superstar and girl next door.
   ``The Big Apple Goes Bananas Over Princess,'' the Sun tabloid
crowed in a headline. The Daily Mail called her the ``Queen of New
York'' in glowing coverage.
   Some papers reported cool spots in a warm reception, and one said
Americans are over-eager and don't understand real royalty.
   ``Americans love a star with a generosity that is not quite
British,'' Charles Laurence wrote in the conservative Daily
Telegraph.
   ``They are imbued with an egalitarian streak that demands their
stars be as human as the boy or girl next door.
   ``This creates a sense of impatience that the royals insist on
the protocols of address and seniority even `off-screen' and a
refusal to accept that in such delicate matters as love and marriage
they are different from that boy and girl next door.''
   He and other British reporters said Americans had asked whether
making the trip alone meant Diana and was having marriage problems
with her husband, Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.
   That sort of speculation was front-page news in Britain for a
time last year.
   The Telegraph gave first honors for what it called royal
exploitation to a shop that displayed ``crude'' mannequins of the
royal family with boxes for heads.
   To The Times, Diana's reception was ``hot and cold'' and
interpreted critical reports as anti-British. ``While small crowds
of fans gathered to cheer and socialites gathered for eleventh-hour
tickets'' to a reception, it said, ``others were declaring their
distaste for royal fuss.''
   ``New York's welcome for the princess veered to the extremes for
which the city is famous,'' the august journal pronounced.
   Reports in most papers ooohed and aaahed over both Diana's poise
and the fans who praised her glamour or waited for a quick glimpse.
   ``Leaving Prince Charles behind on her first visit to New York,
she enchanted hardened New Yorkers and turned thousands of ordinary
Americans into avid royalists,'' the tabloid Daily Mail said. It
printed a picture of Diana with the caption ``Instant hit.''
   Columnist Pete Hammill called Diana the ``most famous welfare
mother in the world,'' they said, an apparent reference to the fact
that her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, and other members of the
royal family receive government allowances.
   Diana and Charles, the Prince of Wales, live on his income from
from land and investments and do not receive such an allowance.

<TEXT>
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, who was killed Thursday in an
avalanche while skiing with Prince Charles, was a career army
officer who became a favorite aide of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Handsome, urbane, fun-loving and an expert skier, Lindsay was
out on the slopes at a resort in Klosters, Switzerland with the
39-year-old heir to the British throne when he was caught in an
avalanche.
   Buckingham Palace said Charles escaped unharmed.
   The prince helped dig out Lindsay, according to Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency, but the major was dead
by the time he was airlifted to a nearby hospital.
   Lindsay, 34, was a close friend of Charles and Princess Diana.
   Last July, Diana and Prince Edward, the youngest brother of
Prince Charles, made a surprise appearance at Lindsay's wedding to
Sarah Brennan at the 10th-century Church of St. Nichola in Compton,
Surrey outside London.
   Mrs. Lindsay, who works in the Buckingham Palace press office,
is expecting the couple's first child in May.
   Lindsay was a major in the British army when he was appointed an
equerry, or aide, to the queen in October 1983. He spent three
years working closely with her before returning to full-time army
duty with the Prince of Wales' 9th-12th Royal Lancers in 1986.
   ``He was the perfect equerry, which means he was the perfect
courtier,'' said Anthony Carthew, court correspondent for
Independent Television. ``He was very good-looking and urbane and
witty.
   ``He was very popular with the queen ... popular indeed with the
whole royal family.''
   He also said Lindsay was a very strong skier.
   In his spare time, Lindsay played in a seven-man blues band
called ``Sweatband,'' which appeared at balls and society parties.
Baroness Isabelle Van Randwyck, a school friend of Diana, also
played in the band.
   Lindsay was vacationing at Klosters in 1986 with Charles and
Diana when Sarah Ferguson made one of her first public appearances
before the announcement of her engagement to Prince Andrew,
Charles' brother.
   The major was playfully prodded with an umbrella by Diana and
Sarah at the races at Royal Ascot last June, to the crowd's delight.

<HEADLINE>  BRITISH ROYALTY FIGHTS EMBATTLED WAR IMAGE
POLL SHOWS PUBLIC 'DISGUSTED' BY BEHAVIOR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     How many of the royal family's subjects are losing sleep over this matter
is not clear. But in a phone-in poll over the weekend, 83 percent of those
participating pronounced themselves "disgusted.";    That in turn prompted the
tabloid newspaper Today to declare with just the slightest overstatement: "The
Queen is today facing the biggest royal crisis since the Abdication (of Edward
VIII) more than 50 years ago.";    Among the elements in the indictment are
these:;    Prince Philip and Prince Charles have gone hunting. Prince Andrew
has played golf. The Duchess of York, also known as Fergie, has enjoyed a loud
meal with some friends at a London restaurant.;    Lord Linley, the Queen's
nephew, took a vacation in the Caribbean with his girlfriend. Lord Althrop,
the Queen's godson, had an adulterous affair in France.;    Queen Elizabeth
and Princess Diana are generally considered to have impeccably performed their
wartime duties.;    But, as royals watchers have noted, it is always the
"minor royals" and the "nearly royals" who ruin things for everyone.;    What
distinguishes this flap from the kind that arises every other week in this
country is that the criticism has come from high places.;    Harold
Brooks-Baker, editor of Burke's Peerage, the bible of the British aristocracy,
has weighed in with his warning.;    So, too, have the editors of the Sunday
Times, which, like Today, is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.;    "On the
home front," the editors wrote, "too many of the young royals and their
entourages carry on regardless with their peacetime lifestyles, parading a
mixture of upper-class decadence and insensitivity which disgusts the public
and demeans the monarchy. The Queen should put a stop to it.";    Coming from
one of the so-called "quality papers," that attack was too much to take for
Charles Anson, the press secretary at Buckingham Palace.;    He responded by
putting out a list of war-related appearances by members of the royal family
since British forces were first deployed in the gulf in August.;    And as if
to answer the charges, the royals were out Monday doing their duty. Prince
Charles and Princess Diana visited navy families in Plymouth; Princess Anne
was at a military base in Germany; and Prince Philip was seeing soldiers in
Northern Ireland.  </TEXT>

FT  13 JAN 93 / PM rejects statutory controls on press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR statutory controls on the press were rejected by Mr John Major
yesterday amid disclosures that at least one member of the Royal family had
sanctioned leaks about their personal life to tabloid newspapers.
Downing Street officials said the prime minister would not support the
creation of a tribunal with legal authority to impose sanctions against
newspapers judged to have breached strict new privacy rules.
His stance was revealed as ministers tacitly confirmed reports that the
Princess of Wales had played a behind-the-scenes role in press coverage last
year of the break-up of her marriage to Prince Charles. There was no
confirmation that Prince Charles had done likewise.
The disclosures were judged at Westminster to have delivered another
damaging blow to the standing of a monarchy which has been plagued by
controversy for more than a year. They had also undercut much of the recent
criticism of the press by those MPs seeking tougher controls.
Mr Major's opposition killed the central recommendation of the report on the
press drawn up by Sir David Calcutt, QC, even before it was officially
published.
According to leaks of the report - confirmed as accurate by officials - Sir
David calls for the replacement of the present Press Complaints Commission
by a statutory tribunal with the powers to impose large fines on newspapers.
The report was handed to ministers last week and will be considered by the
full cabinet tomorrow but one senior minister commented bluntly last night:
'There is not a hope in hell of a statutory body.'
Lord McGregor of Durris, the chairman of the PCC and a fierce opponent of
statutory regulation, said last night that it was 'game, set and match' to
opponents of the Calcutt report. He described the section of the report
devoted to the PCC as 'reeking with prejudice and malice'.
Downing Street stressed that the prime minister's judgment had not been
affected by the latest revelations concerning the role played by Princess
Diana in the sensational reporting of her marriage problems.
Mr Major and other senior colleagues still backed the idea of new
legislation to outlaw electronic eavesdropping and other 'intrusive'
practices which involved trespass on private property.
The aim would be to protect all individuals from unjustified invasions of
privacy rather than to shield specifically the Royal Family and other
prominent public figures.
But the reports that close friends of Princess Diana fed information on her
behalf to the tabloids to ensure her case was present in stories about the
marriage break-up caused acute embarrassment in Downing Street.
It also raised new question marks among MPs about Mr Major's insistence last
month that the subsequent separation of the Royal couple would not prevent
Princess Diana at some stage being crowned Queen.
The disclosure was made in a letter sent by Lord McGregor to Sir David as
part of his inquiry. Lord McGregor revealed that Buckingham Palace had
apologised to him after first denying and then, in effect, admitting that
Princess Diana had actively collaborated in reports. Officials confirmed
that Mr Major and other senior ministers had been kept informed last year of
the charge laid by Lord Mc-Gregor.

Prince Charles and Princess Diana arrived in Hong Kong today for a three-day 
official visit, possibly the last by British royalty before the colony reverts 
to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
All air traffic was halted before the royal flight touched down at Kai Tak 
Airport, which has one of the world's most spectacular runways, jutting out 
into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Charles is expected to hear the concerns of Chinese in Hong Kong who are 
worried about their future under Beijing sovereignty. Local fears have been 
heightened by the crushing in June of China's pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been scheduled to visit China, but the trip was canceled after 
the brutal crackdown in Beijing, and they went to Indonesia instead after a 
last-minute invitation by President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Houston the Duchess of York ended a five-day visit to Texas with 
a visit to an inner-city school where she took part in a day filled with 
anti-drug messages. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old former Sarah Ferguson was also serenaded by more than 600 
pupils at Blackshear Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to Houston on 
Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera, which is saluting 300 
years of British opera.

   Princess Diana is a spunky, bewitchingly natural
young woman with a magnetic charge of glamour that has dragged the
sleepy British monarchy into the age of mass media, according to a
published report.
   And the future queen likes to wear glitzy costume jewelry as
much as the real thing, according to a special issue of People
magazine, released for previews Sunday. The issue is titled ``All
About Diana: The Private World of a Princess.''
   People reports that Princess Di, who turns 27 on July 1, enjoys
a royal family fortune of $680 million. With this wealth comes a
personal collection of jewelry estimated at about $1.5 million and
use of cars that include a Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Bentley. She and
Prince Charles have an annual income of about $3 million and four
royal homes.
   The one woman Diana trusts most, the magazine reports, is her
mother, Frances Shand Kydd, 52.
   People reports that Diana enjoys greeting her sons at the palace
when they arrive home from school and reading them bedtime stories.
   While Prince Charles often spends the evening working in his
study, Diana watches her favorite television soap operas.

   Frank Zamboni, the man who made his name a
household word in hockey country, fittingly received his first
honorary degree from Clarkson University, an NCAA Division I hockey
power in upstate New York.
   Zamboni, 87, inventor of the ice resurfacing machine that bears
his name, was awarded an honorary doctor of engineering degree at
the university's commencement exercises Sunday.
   ``He's very important to us here in the North Country,'' said
Clark Bailey, assistant to acting Clarkson president R. Thomas
Williamson.
   Bailey nominated Zamboni, a man with a ninth grade education,
for the doctorate.
   ``I felt that this guy epitomized the work ethic,'' said Bailey.
   Zamboni, a Utah native, invented the machine in 1949 while
operating a California ice skating rink. The machine greatly
reduced the time needed to resurface the ice.

   Estelle Getty, one of television's
``Golden Girls,'' says her cause is the aging of America.
   Because of death, illness or divorce, many women suddenly find
they ``have to face the world alone. The world is not Noah's Ark,
and people can get by without walking two by two,'' Ms. Getty said.
   She also said she doesn't like to get specific about either her
age or her height.
   ``Don't ask me how tall I am. That's one question I don't
answer,'' the diminutive co-star of the ``Golden Girls'' situation
comedy told an audience of 300 people Sunday at a women's health
day speech at McLeod Regional Medical Center.
   ``We're all the same age,'' said Ms. Getty, who's a little under
5 feet tall and a little over 60.
   She says the living arrangement on her television show, in which
older women share a home, is ``independence through
interdependence.'' Her housemates have private bedrooms and
bathrooms but share in a household community.
   Ms. Getty is planning to publish this fall a book _ titled ``If
I Knew Then What I Know Now, So What'' _ on her observations and
philosophy from 40 years of marriage and two sons.
   ``Women marry men thinking they're going to change them, and
they never do,'' she said. ``Men marry women hoping they will never
change, but they invariably do.''

   The Dalai Lama says he's content with his simple
and meditative life, but he recognizes the historic importance of
greed, drive and ambition.
   ``To a certain extent, advancement and human progress come from
being greedy ... With too much contentment, nothing gets done,''
the Dalai Lama says in an interview in the June issue of Life
magazine.
   The leader of the world's Tibetan Buddhists, who has lived in
exile in India since a rebellion against the Chinese in 1959, says
he doesn't regret not being able to exercise normal human passions.
   ``Certain people think that without love, sex, anger, they would
be lifeless,'' he said. ``To me such things make life colorful, but
also turbulent. They make life go up and down. Without extreme
feelings, life is in one way colorless, but it is very steady.''
   Asked about the role of religious leaders such as Jesse Jackson
and Pat Robertson in politics, the Dalai Lama said ``politicians
should have more spiritual experience.''
   ``That will help them to conduct politics with more moral
principle,'' he said, adding: ``The reality of a big country like
the United States is that there are many religions, many cultures.
America might not be suited to a leader from one religion.''

A barefooted Princess Diana and an aproned Prince Charles didn't fare too well 
in the parents' race at their sons' school, but it was the spanking that Di 
gave Prince William that made the news. 
</P>
<P>
Diana shed her shoes before running across the turf in red culottes and a 
striped sweater, placing third or fourth in the mothers' race Wednesday, 
depending on who was doing the judging. 
</P>
<P>
Charles was well back in the field of fathers who donned aprons for a race. 
</P>
<P>
The day finished badly for William, 7, despite his team's triumph in a 
tug-of-war. Diana spanked him after he defied her orders by dashing off to play 
with his pals at the end of his school sports day. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun newspaper ran a picture of the spanking under a headline that declared 
"Wallop." Another tabloid, the Daily Mirror, heralded it as the "slap that 
could change the world," saying too many parents have been brainwashed into 
thinking that any kind of punishment is wrong. "But there is a great difference 
between a slap from a loving parent, like Princess Diana, and corporal 
punishment," the newspaper said.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Prince Charles and Diana to separate but not divorce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCE and Princess of Wales are to separate, Buckingham Palace
announced yesterday, but the government said the princess could still become
Queen.
Mr John Major told MPs the decision had no constitutional implications and
there were 'no plans' for the couple to divorce. Prince Charles's succession
as head of the Church of England, which frowns on divorce, was also
unaffected.
The prime minister said: 'There is no reason why the Princess of Wales
should not be crowned Queen in due course.'
The couple's 11-year marriage had been subject to intense speculation by
newspapers, fuelled by the publication in June of a biography of the
princess by Mr Andrew Morton. Buckingham Palace said the Queen was
'saddened' by the announcement and wanted an end to the press intrusions
into the couple's lives.
The Queen believes 'a degree of privacy and understanding is essential if
their Royal Highnesses are to provide a happy and secure upbringing for
their children, while continuing to give a wholehearted commitment to their
public duties'. The prince and princess will continue to carry out public
engagements - sometimes together, as at tomorrow night's state banquet in
Edinburgh for European Community leaders.
The princess will live in Kensington Palace. The prince will stay in
Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, and, when in London, with his grandmother,
the Queen Mother, at Clarence House.
The announcement follows, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis for the
royal family - dominated by newspaper reports of marital rifts and the
behaviour of its junior members - that has stimulated debate about the
future of the House of Windsor.
After a political row over the cost of the Windsor Castle fire, the Queen
said she would pay income tax and reduce the number of publicly funded
royals.
The separation of Charles and Diana could have wider implications. If either
wanted to divorce, the question of the succession would trigger
constitutional uncertainty not seen since the abdication of King Edward VIII
in 1936.
Downing Street last night refused to comment on 'hypothetical' scenarios. Mr
Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, believes that
the prince will renounce the throne in favour of his eldest son, William.
The idea of a single-parent Queen separated from her husband was greeted
with gasps by MPs. 'There is no possibility of this working,' said Mr
Brooks-Baker.

   Prince Charles flew home Friday with the body of a
friend who was killed by a Swiss avalanche that nearly engulfed the
future king as it roared down a mountain in a ``terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   With Maj. Hugh Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, the prince
watched as six soldiers from his dead friend's Royal Lancers
regiment bore the flag-draped coffin from the red and white jet of
the Queen's Flight.
   The 39-year-old heir to the throne was praised for helping save
the life of another skier in his party but called foolhardy for
skiing perilous slopes off the main trails of the Klosters resort.
   A private funeral service in Devon was being arranged for
Lindsay, but no date was announced. Independent Television News
reported that Lindsay, an avid cricket player, had said he wanted
his ashes to be scattered on the cricket ground in his home town of
Budleigh Salterton.
   Charles, his wife, Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the
Duchess of York, all dressed in black, walked under leaden skies
from the jet at Northolt air base near London.
   They were met by Mrs. Lindsay, 34, a Buckingham Palace press
officer who had helped answer inquiries about Thursday's accident
before discovering her husband had died.
   She and Lindsay, also 34, were married last summer and she
expects a baby in May. He was a former aide to Queen Elizabeth II,
the prince's mother.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at the Zurich
airport after the royal party left, Charles said he and five
companions were skiing ``at our risk and we all accepted ... that
mountains have to be treated with the greatest respect and not
treated lightly.''
   When the avalanche started ``with a trememdous roaring'' he and
three others skied out of its path, Charles said.
   Then, ``to my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson just failed to ski clear and were swept away in a
whirling maelstrom as the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past
us to the valley below. It was all over in a terrifying matter of
seconds.''
   He described helping dig Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson out of the
snow with a shovel, then with his hands. Both of her legs were
broken and she is hospitalized in Switzerland.
   The royal party cut the skiiing holiday short. It began Tuesday
and ended tragically at 2:45 p.m. Thursday when the avalanche
hurtled down the mountain toward Charles; Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson;
her husband, Charles; Lindsay; Swiss guide Bruno Sprecher; and a
Swiss policeman.
   They were skiing off the main track between the treacherous
Gotschnawang and Drostobel trails at an altitude of about 5,800
feet when the snowslide began about 300 feet above them. Officials
had warned of avalanche danger at 5,200 feet and higher.
   ``Herr Sprecher acted with incredible speed and total
professionalism,'' the prince said. ``He skied down as fast as
possible, having told the Swiss policeman to radio for assistance.''
   Sprecher located Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson by a beeper on her body.
   ``Mr. Palmer-Tomkinson and I skied down and just arrived as Herr
Sprecher had reached Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson's head,'' the statement
said. ``He gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and revived her.
He gave me the shovel to dig her out and I tried using my hands as
well.
   ``At this point I sat with Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson while he
(Sprecher) quickly went to try and locate Maj. Lindsay. He found
him about 15 yards above Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, but tragically he
had been killed outright during the fall.''
   Mrs. Lindsay left the Northolt base with her father. She was
carrying a bag apparently containing some of her husband's
belongings that the Duchess of York had given to her.
   Prince Charles departed for Windsor Castle, 20 miles away, to
see the queen and Diana and the Duchess of York went to Kensington
Palace.
   ``Thereafter their movements for the weekend are private,''
Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident highlighted the sometimes risky behavior of
Britain's royals.
   Hours before the avalanche, the Duchess of York, 28 and four
months pregnant, took a bad fall skiing.
   That night, the Royal Navy ship on which her husband, Prince
Andrew, is serving lost a helicopter with two crewmen off Portugal.
Andrew, younger brother of Charles, was not involved but he is a
helicopter pilot.
   The avalanche was the worst accident for the royal family since
Prince William of Gloucester, a cousin of the queen, died in a
crash during an air race in 1972.
   Newspapers clamored on Friday for Charles and other members of
the royal family to give up dangerous pursuits.
   ``Why was he there?'' the tabloid Sun asked. ``Charles has
consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes.''
   Charles is an ardent polo player who has taken many falls, and
had a near-collision while flying a plane. On his first parachute
jump he snarled the rigging and fell several thousand feet before
untangling it.

<HEAD>Princess Beatrice Gives Short Cry At Baptism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice was bapitized Tuesday by the
archbishop of York with water from the Jordan River, and she let out
just one quick cry as her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York,
watched in delight.
   The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of Britain's royal
family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the
archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made
her a member of the Church of England.
   Queen Elizabeth II, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head
of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at St. James'
Palace after the christening to pose briefly for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and
matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on Aug. 8, 1988, at 8:18
p.m., considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers.
   Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn
woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the
``blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of ``poisoned
glut'' and ``poisoned seas.''
   The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, Prince
Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of
duty in the Far East.
   Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev.
John Habgood, Archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the
church rather than Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the
church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of
``personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York
title.
   The Chapel Royal, the main surviving part of the Tudor Palace
built by Henry VIII, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married in the chapel in 1840
and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there.
   The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the
parents, ``Jesus, Good Above All Other,'' ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, ``Away In A Manger.''
   The choir also sang ``Princess Beatrice's Anthem,'' composed by
Richard Popplewell, organist and choir master of the queen's Chapels
Royal, with words by the late Lord Gorell, a literary magazine
editor.
   Beatrice was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of
flowing cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen Victoria's eldest
son in 1842.
   She was baptized at the silver gilt Lily Font, made for the
christening in 1840 of Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria's eldest
child, and used to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children.
   Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, Beatrice's five were
reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil
and to follow Christ.
   Her godparents are Viscount Linley, son of the queen's sister
Princess Margaret; property developer Peter Palumbo, who is chairman
of the Arts Council; Mrs. Harry Cotterell, who formerly shared an
apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of Roxburghe, at whose
Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah Ferguson; and Mrs.
John Greenall, a friend of the duchess.
   Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, his wife, Princess Diana and
their two children, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4. Queen
Mother Elizabeth, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also
there.
   After the ceremony, the guests went to Buckingham Palace for a
tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the
palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took
the official family photographs of the christening party.

   Prince Andrew arrived at a London hospital today
with a bouquet of red roses to visit his wife, Sarah, and their
newborn daughter as delighted Britons celebrated the princess'
birth on an especially lucky day.
   Champagne corks popped, bells rang and cameras flashed outside
Portland Hospital in central London with the announcement Monday
night of the birth of a 6-pound, 12-ounce girl to Andrew, the Duke
of York, and his red-haired duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London this afternoon
celebrating the royal birth.
   The Princess of York, who has not yet been named, is their first
child and the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Jane Makim, the duchess' elder sister who lives in Australia,
told British reporters that her mother, Susan Barrantes, who was at
the hospital for the birth, had telephoned to say the baby was very
alert, had elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit
for a princess.
   ``My mother said the baby is beautiful. Just a nice weight and
everything. Not much hair but very pretty,'' Mrs. Makim said.
   Andrew, sporting a yellow rose in the lapel of his dark blue
suit, smiled and waved to a large crowd of journalists and several
dozen well-wishers before going inside the American-owned Portland
Hospital.
   Only 24 hours earlier, he had looked somber and anxious as he
drove his 28-year-old wife to the hospital from the country home
west of London which they are renting from King Hussein of Jordan.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the duchess' obstetrician, was also at the
hospital today. He led a team of four doctors in the delivery room.
   Hundreds of people on their way to work this morning stopped off
at Buckingham Palace to see the brief notice posted on the gates
announcing the baby's birth.
   Polish student Arek Ilnicki went straight there after arriving
in London. ``I think the English are a bit mad about the baby. But
it's good.''
   Andrew, the 28-year-old second son of the monarch and a Royal
Navy lieutenant, flew to London on Sunday from Singapore where he
is on sea duty on HMS Edinburgh. News of the birth was announced to
the ship's crew and the prince's fellow officers immediately
toasted to the health of the baby and parents.
   The Buckingham Palace statement announcing the birth said the
Duchess of York was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m..''
   The statement said the delivery was ``a normal birth'' and
`there were no complications.'' Neither the palace nor the doctors
would say whether the birth had been induced, as newspapers had
speculated.
   Andrew was present at his daughter's birth, the palace said.
British press reports said the prince, an accomplished amateur
photographer, took the first photos of his daughter.
   There was much speculation over the baby's name, with Elizabeth
and Victoria as favorites. Early in his wife's pregnancy Andrew had
been quoted as saying the baby would be called Annabel.
   Whatever the choice, the baby will be Her Royal Highness,
Princess (name) of York. She is fifth in line to the throne behind
Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, Charles' two children
Prince William and Prince Harry, and Andrew himself. The queen's
two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara Phillips, are the children
of her only daughter, Anne.
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 on the eighth day of the
eighth month of the century's 88th year is being taken by
well-wishers as a sign of great good fortune. The day is considered
highly auspicious by Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for
eight is similar to that for prosperity.
   The Times of London headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A Safe
and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun said: ``Fergie's first
baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   A message of congratulation from Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her husband, Denis, who are visiting Bangkok, read:
``It is wonderful news and your happiness will be shared by the
whole nation.''
   It was not known how soon the queen and her husband, Prince
Philip, would see the baby. The queen has public engagements in
Scotland today and is cruising off the Scottish coast in the royal
yacht Britannia.
   The Queen Mother Elizabeth is on vacation in Scotland.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, and their sons go to the
Spanish island of Majorca this week for a vacation with the Spanish
royal family.

<HEAD>Peer Who Organized Prince Charles And Diana's Wedding Is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Maclean, the former chief official of Queen
Elizabeth II's household and organizer of the 1981 wedding of
Prince Charles, has died, his family announced today. He was 73.
   Maclean died Thursday at Hampton Court Palace, a former royal
residence in London, where he had been chief steward since 1985.
The announcement gave no cause of death.
   The Scottish baron became lord chamberlain in 1971. Before he
retired from the post in 1984, he had established a reputation as a
perfectionist in royal ceremonies while overseeing the queen's
household.
   The wedding of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son, and Lady
Diana Spencer in St. Paul's Cathedral was a highlight of his term.
   In a spontaneous gesture, Princess Diana kissed him before a
train carried the newlyweds away on their honeymoon.
   Maclean served as a Scots Guards infantry officer in World War
II, fighting in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. After
the war, he became a sheep and cattle farmer.
   In 1959, he became leader of the Boy Scouts in Britain and the
Commonwealth. He went on to revolutionize the staid image of the
movement founded by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908, adding sports such
as gliding and cave diving to traditional scouting activities. He
retired as chief scout in 1975.
   Maclean's first ceremonial assignment as lord chamberlain was
the 1972 funeral of the Duke of Windsor, who as King Edward VIII
abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis
Simpson.
   The assignment was difficult because of the bad feeling
engendered by the abdication among other members of the royal
family. But Maclean was judged to have handled the funeral
arrangements with great skill.
   Royalty watchers noted with approval that Maclean did not bow
when he said farewell to the duke's widow as she left.
   Maclean also organized the silver wedding celebration of Queen
Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, that year.
   His job as lord chamberlain sometimes involved odd
responsibilities. He once had to advise the queen whether she
should keep her centuries-old legal right to possession of every
whale and sturgeon washed up on the British coast. After some
deliberation, Maclean advised her to renounce it, saying it might
prove a nuisance.
   There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.
   He is survived by his wife and their son and daughter.

<HEAD>Prince Charles: Ski Party Was Aware of Avalanche Dangers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS graf at bottom with funeral arrangements</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles said a roaring avalanche that
missed him in the Swiss Alps took only seconds to bury two skiing
partners, killing one. He said his skiing party was aware of the
dangers when they left the main trails.
   The Hon. Audrey Lindsay, mother of the dead skier, Maj. Hugh
Lindsay, was quoted today by the British domestic news agency Press
Association as telling a relative: ``I don't blame anybody. It was
an unfortunate accident.''
   Looking distraught and wearing black, Charles, his wife,
Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the Duchess of York,
returned home Friday from Switzerland.
   Their plane, which landed at Northolt air base near London,
carried the coffin containing the body of the 34-year-old Lindsay,
a former aide to Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and a close
friend of Charles and Diana.
   They were met at the base by Lindsay's widow, Sarah Lindsay, who
is expecting a baby in May. Mrs. Lindsay, a Buckingham Palace press
officer, had helped answer questions about the avalanche before
discovering her husband was killed in it.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at Zurich airport
after the royal party left for England, Charles, the heir to the
British throne, said:
   ``All members of my party were skiing off the piste (the regular
ski runs) at own our risk and we all accepted ... that mountains
have to be treated with the greatest respect and not treated
lightly,'' he said.
   He said that when the avalanche Thursday at Klosters,
Switzerland, started ``with a tremendous roaring'' he and three
others in the group skied out its path. The other two, Lindsay and
Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson could not evade the snow slide.
   ``To my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson just
failed to ski clear and were swept away in a whirling maelstrom as
the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us to the valley
below,'' the prince said. ``It was all over in a terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   Charles described how he helped dig Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson out of
the snow with a shovel and then with his hands. She broke both legs
and is in a Swiss hospital.
   The 39-year-old prince has been skiing for more than 15 years
and knows the area well where the avalanche occurred. He was
leading the ski party and Press Association quoted police at
Klosters as saying he personally asked Thursday for the party to be
allowed to ski on the perilous slopes where the avalanche later
occurred.
   Charles was praised for helping save the life of Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson. But some British newspapers called him foolhardy
for taking on the dangerous Haglamatte slopes of Klosters.
   Mrs. Lindsay was at Northolt to see six soldiers from her late
husband's Royal Lancers regiment carry his flag-draped coffin from
the red and white jet of the Queen's Flight.
   She left afterwards with her father while Charles went to
Windsor Castle 20 miles away to see the queen. Diana and Sarah left
in another car for Kensington Palace in London.
   ``Their movements for the weekend are private,'' Buckingham
Palace said.
   Lindsay's funeral is expected to take place at the Royal
Military College at Sandhurst on Thursday, provided legal matters
are settled in time, his regiment, the 9th@12th Royal Lancers said
today. The service in the Memorial Chapel will be followed by a
cremation.

NEW YORK OFFERS PRINCESS DIANA BOTH PROTOCOL, PROTESTS

Hours before the Princess of Wales stepped off the British Concorde at Kennedy 
Airport on Wednesday, one of her spokesmen tried to give an etiquette lesson to 
New York's hyper-aggressive press corps. 
</P>
<P>
"The Princess of Wales doesn't operate in every way like a President of the 
United States or like a senior political figure," Francis Cornish of the 
British Information Service, explained. 
</P>
<P>
"If people think it would be a good idea to shout questions, I can tell you 
here and now that you won't get an answer. Frankly, you're more likely to get 
the back of her head," he warned. "She will not give any interviews." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Koch Pledges Politeness 
</P>
<P>
New York's normally outspoken Mayor Edward I. Koch pledged, meanwhile, that he 
would be polite and "not rain on her parade." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young woman who has nothing to do but represent the royal family in 
a royal way," Koch said. The mayor said that, above all, he would not bring up 
the touchy subject of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do that," Koch told reporters. "I don't happen to agree with 
the British government's position with respect to Northern Ireland. I believe 
that the phrase 'Brits out of Ireland' still applies. But I'm not going to 
insult this young woman." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Big Apple, Lady Di. 
</P>
<P>
The princess' three-day, high-profile visit is designed to stress social causes 
and to push British products ranging from cashmere sweaters to a toy called 
Thomas the Tank Engine -- a railroad locomotive with a happy smiling face. 
</P>
<P>
Irish-American foes of British rule in Northern Ireland promised to protest the 
visit, especially when the 27-year-old princess attends the Welsh Opera's 
American premiere, a performance of "Falstaff" tonight at the Brooklyn Academy 
of Music. After the final curtain and a backstage visit with the cast, she is 
to be the honored guest at a lavish dinner in the soaring glass and steel 
Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
During her visit to New York, Diana is staying in a flower-filled 
$1,800-a-night deluxe duplex hotel suite with deep red walls with its own 
solarium and terrace -- but without Prince Charles, who remains at home to hand 
out awards to a variety of Britons, including dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"The prince and princess receive several thousands of invitations a year in the 
U.K. and abroad," explained Dickie Arbiter, assistant press secretary to the 
queen. "In order to satisfy the thousands of requests that come in, they have 
to split their resources." 
</P>
<P>
Just before dinner time, smiling and looking radiant in a royal blue wool coat 
and a string of pearls, Diana arrived amid heavy security at Kennedy Airport 
and rushed off to her first stop, a reception hosted by a firm that produces 
Scottish cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
She also will promote British toy manufacturers by visiting FAO Schwarz, the 
huge 5th Avenue toy store. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will also stress social problems. Diana will tour the Henry Street 
Settlement's Urban Family Center in Lower Manhattan, a pioneering program 
serving as an alternative to welfare hotels for homeless families, and Harlem 
Hospital's pediatric AIDS unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people are pretty excited," said Fred Winters, a hospital 
spokesman. "I think all Americans are excited when they meet royalty." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the princess said that her visits to Harlem Hospital and the 
Henry Street shelter were designed to follow up some of her own social 
interests in England. 
</P>
<P>
"She is aware these are problems that loom large on the New York scene," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Prince Charles visited New York some years ago, he was picketed heavily by 
Irish-Americans protesting British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Nassau County Comptroller Peter King, chairman of the Committee for Legal 
Justice in Northern Ireland, said he would lead similar protests outside the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music.

A royal jet carrying Princess Diana was forced to make an emergency landing 
today because of an electrical problem that cropped up just after takeoff on 
the first leg of a visit to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers repaired the problem and the 28-year-old princess of Wales and her 
entourage later left on the first official visit to a Warsaw Pact nation by 
members of the House of Windsor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The first stop was to be in Ancona, Italy, where the royal party was to pick up 
Prince Charles, Diana's husband and the heir to the British throne, before 
flying on to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. Prince Charles was in Italy to 
open his first exhibition of watercolor paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The unspecified electrical fault was detected shortly after the BAE-146 
aircraft -- manned by the Queen's Flight, members of the Royal Air Force -- 
took off from London's Heathrow Airport, authorities said. The pilot 
immediately diverted to London's nearby Gatwick Airport, where the problem was 
solved. The princess and her party of about 20 remained aboard the aircraft 
while British Airways engineers fixed the problem.

<HEAD>Bookmakers Stop Bets On Sex and Name of Duchess' Baby</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of London's leading bookmakers has stopped
taking bets on the sex and name of the Duchess of York's unborn
child because her husband, Prince Andrew, was quoted as saying it
will be a girl called Annabel.
   The Sun newspaper reported Friday that Andrew told a Yorkshire
cricket team about his prediction this week after the team offered
him a child's cricket bat.
   ``It won't be much use. I'm sure we are having a girl,'' the
paper quoted Andrew as saying. It said the 28-year-old prince, a
Royal Navy helicopter pilot, told the guests the baby will be
called Annabel.
   In Britain, cricket is primarily played by boys.
   The former Sarah Ferguson, who married Queen Elizabeth II's son
in July 1986, is expecting their first child in August.
   Buckingham Palace said the report that the 28-year-old duchess
was expecting a girl was just speculation.
   ``Certainly, we are not in a position to talk about the private
coversations of the Duke of York. It's all speculation,'' said a
spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified.
   But Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for bookmakers William Hill,
said: ``We decided that the reported remarks of the Duke of York
represented an ideal opportunity for us to close the book on the
sex and name of the baby.''
   Sharpe said if Andrew's quote had surfaced soon after the
duchess become pregnant, ``we might not have given it credence.''
   But now that she's six months along, he said, ``they must have a
good idea of what they would call the baby, be it male or female.
After six months, if they want to know what the sex of the baby is,
it's very easy to find out.''
   In recent weeks, he said, Annabel went from a 20-1 to 3-1
favorite.
   ``The last time anything similar happened was when we had heavy
backing for the name William to be chosen as the name of Charles
and Diana's firstborn, and of course we all know what happened
there.''
   Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, and his wife, Princess
Diana, chose William as the name of their first son, who was born
in June 1982. William is second in line to the British throne
behind his father.
   Sharpe said William Hill had taken in about $56,000 in bets on
the name and sex of the baby.
   ``It's not as much as was bet on William, but it's more than on
Harry,'' he said. Prince Harry, the second son of Charles and
Diana, was born in September 1984.
   Sharpe said punters with an appetite for things royal would
still be able to bet on the weight of the duchess' baby and its
birth date. ``We're offering 7-1 against them being able to tell us
the date on which the baby is born,'' he said.

   Princess Diana's brother and his

George Washington's ancestors are buried.
   The marriage of Viscount Althorp and former model Victoria
Lockwood had been proclaimed ``the nearly royal wedding of the
year'' by The Sunday Times of London.
   The bride wore the Spencer family tiara that Diana wore when she
married Prince Charles in 1981.
   Like Diana's, the wedding was conducted by the archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie _ ``a very nice man,'' in
the opinion of the eighth Earl Spencer, father of the groom, whose
comments were included in a packet of press material on the ceremony.
   Charles and Diana were among the guests, and their second son,
five-year-old Prince Harry, was a page. Security, in deference to
the royals, was strict, and villagers needed red tickets to be
admitted to an enclosure near the church.
   Unlike the royal wedding in the vast St. Paul's Cathedral in
London, Saturday's ceremony was crammed into the medieval Church of
St. Mary the Virgin, two miles from the family seat of Althorp. Six
pews were removed to make room for an orchestra and a choir, leaving
space for about 250 guests.
   Another 200 people were invited for champagne and a light supper
afterwards at the family house. The estate stands in
Northamptonshire amid rolling pastures where sheep and cattle graze
among the hedgerows.
   Barbara Cartland, 88-year-old queen of romance novelists and
mother of the earl's second wife, arrived in a hot pink chiffon
dress and hat.
   Charles Althorp, 25, who is a reporter for NBC's ``Today'' Show,
is in line to become the ninth Earl and inherit an estimated $80
million fortune, including the Althorp estate.
   Miss Lockwood, 24, a former fashion model, became engaged to
Althorp in July following a six-week romance.
   St. Mary's, with its tall beacon tower, has been the church of
the Spencer family _ Princess Diana's family _ since 1508 when Sir
John Spencer bought the 15,000-acre Althorp estate.
   Laurence Washington, the great-great-great-grandfather of the
first American president, was a cousin by marriage of the Spencers
and lived on the estate until he died in December 1616 and was
buried in the chancel near the church altar. Laurence's younger
brother, Robert, also is buried in the church.
   Their tombstones bear the Washington coat of arms with three
stars over two horizontal bars. It is thought to have inspired the
design of the American flag.
   As promised last week, church officials took up a collection from
among the assembled journalists to raise money to help restore the
church. There was no word on how much was raised.
   Church officials say they need $190,000 to preserve the church,
which overlooks the thatched roofs and farmlands of Great Brington,
66 miles northwest of London.
   Several hundred people, fortified by picnic baskets and
thermoses, staked out places near the church despite a drenching
rain.
   ``It's the wedding of the year,'' said Emily Coghlan, 64, an
onlooker who deployed her lawn chair in front of the church at 7
a.m., eight hours before the ceremony.

   A crude incendiary device has been sent to
Princess Diana at Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said.
   The palace's security system spotted it Thursday within minutes
and anti-terrorist squad officers took it away for forensic
examination, a police statement said.
   ``It must be emphasized that this crude incendiary device was
not a bomb and did not originate from any terrorist organization,''
the statement said.
   Police sources said it was believed the work of ``a crank.''
   Scotland Yard said no member of the royal family was ever at
risk in the incident.
   The device was contained in a package addressed to the Princess
of Wales and delivered to Buckingham Palace Thursday morning, the
statement said.
   It is not known where the princess was when the package arrived.
She and her husband, Prince Charles, live about a mile away at
Kensington Palace when they are in London.
   Diana kept to her official schedule and visited a center for the
elderly in southwest London Thursday morning.

   In the two years since she married the queen's
second son Andrew, the Duchess of York has brought both sparkle and
new controversy to the royal scene.
   Some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of fun
tiresome or vulgar, her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless.
   But royal watchers say the 28-year-old former Sarah Ferguson is
a favorite with Queen Elizabeth II.
   Prince Andrew, a tall, handsome Royal Navy lieutenant, gained a
playboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood. It included a
well-publicized romance with an American actress, Koo Stark, who
once appeared in soft-porn movies.
   But by the spring of 1986 Andrew was clearly smitten with the
red-haired Miss Ferguson. The public were enjoying her lively good
nature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved that
Andrew had found a suitable wife.
   They married at Westminster Abbey July 23, 1986, and became the
Duke and Duchess of York. Both were 26.
   Sarah Ferguson was a new kind of royal bride.
   A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when
she married, she had led a free and independent life that included
a three-year romance with motor-racing figure Paddy McNally, a
widower with two sons.
   Robust, athletic and outspoken, Sarah was far from the slim,
demure and impeccably-groomed English rose that Princess Diana,
wife of Prince Charles, typified.
   She kept working after her marriage, and although she had given
up her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free-lance
work.
   While Andrew pursued his career as a Royal Navy pilot, his wife
learned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share the
experience with him.
   The Yorks have rejected the traditional choice of an old stately
home and are building a new house near Windsor Castle _ in a
neo-Tudor style that has drawn some criticism.
   Sarah's attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to some
howling failures, each of which was dissected in the press.
   The media also criticized what they saw as the duchess' brash
and vulgar behavior during the couple's March U.S. tour,
particularly in Los Angeles.
   Newspapers were especially critical of the duchess' quip: ``I'll
see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``I love you'' at a
dinner.
   When Sarah wore a flamboyant black-and-red gown to a black-tie
dinner, Craig Brown of The Sunday Times wrote: ``While the stars of
Hollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, down
the stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won third
prize for her Carmen Miranda impersonation ... at some forgotten
resort.''
   ``Has the Duchess of York gone too far?'' asked the Observer
newspaper.
   As Sarah grew heavily pregnant, the tabloids carried
unflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight.
   But the duchess's sense of humor scarcely flagged _ except in
May when a newspaper carried a photo of her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, emerging from a London massage parlor.
   While some newspapers called him Romeo Ronnie and suggested he
be fired from his job as polo manager to Prince Charles, the heir
to the throne, and others said the duchess was advised to avoid him
in public, Sarah was photographed speaking to her father, worriedly.
   The major had become a close friend of the queen's husband,
Prince Philip, through their shared interest in polo. Sarah, born
Oct. 15, 1959, has known all the queen's children since childhood.
   She became a close friend of Diana, who is reported to have done
some matchmaking in Sarah's relationship with Andrew.
   Sarah grew up at her family's 18th-century farmhouse set in
1,200 acres of rolling Hampshire countryside at Dummer. She was
educated at two local boarding schools, Daneshill and Hurst Lodge,
where she was head girl _ the school leader _ excelling at sports
rather than studies.
   Sarah's parents divorced when she was 14, and her mother, Susan,
married Argentine polo professional Hector Barrantes. They live at
Trenque Laughen near Buenos Aires and travel the international polo
circuit.
   After school, Sarah studied at St. James' secretarial college in
London. Then it was off to work, first at an apartment rental
agency, then at a Covent Garden art gallery, a sports public
relations agency and finally as a sales executive with B.C.K.
Graphic Arts in fashionable Mayfair.

REPORTS in the British media of difficulties in the marriage of the Prince
and Princess of Wales do not pose any constitutional crisis for the
monarchy, constitutional experts said yesterday.
Lord St John of Fawsley, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said that
the allegations published in The Sunday Times about the marriage, based on
Diana: Her True Story, a book by Andrew Morton, 'cast a shadow over the
monarchy and must be very upsetting for the Queen'. But, he added, 'they
have no effect on the role of the Queen or the role of the Prince of Wales'.
Lord St John said that if the prince and princess divorced, it would have no
effect on the succession. Other constitutional experts agreed.
Lord St John said: 'The role of the royal family as exemplar of family life
and values would be diminished, but there would be no practical effect on
the succession. Divorce is very widespread and accepted.'
In his book Mr Morton claims that Princess Diana attempted to commit suicide
during the 1980s. The book details conversations with friends of the
princess who say her marriage is a sham and that she is convinced she will
never become queen.
Buckingham Palace would not comment on the allegations yesterday.
A spokesman said yesterday that the Princess of Wales had not co-operated
over Mr Morton's book 'in any way whatsoever' and she had not seen the
proofs.
'As far as we are concer-ned it's business as usual. They both have official
engagements today which they will be fulfilling.'
He denied that, in the wake of the divorce of the Princess Royal and the
recent separation of the Duke and Duchess of York, the Palace's failure to
refute the allegations was fuelling a constitutional crisis.
'What constitutional crisis? There is no constitutional crisis,' he said.
He added that it was pointless to speculate about the effect of a divorce of
the Prince and Princess of Wales, because that was a purely hypothetical
situation.
Mr Brian Hanson, legal officer of the General Synod of the Church of
England, confirmed that the Prince of Wales could divorce and still succeed
to the throne with the title of Supreme Governor of the Church. He said:
'The only fetter on the heir to the throne is becoming a Roman Catholic or
marrying a Roman Catholic. In theory a divorce would be possible.'
Lord St John said damage to the monarchy caused by the book would be
limited.
Most of the events described in it and reported by the weekend press took
place in the early 1980s and were out of date. The feeling of the British
people was mostly against the press and not against the royal family.
'I am not worried about the future of the monarchy as a result of this,'
Lord St John said. 'Perhaps it will lead people to take a more realistic
view of the monarchy as ordinary people with ordinary problems.'

   The Duke and Duchess of York named their
two-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The baby, who is fifth in line to the throne, will be known as
Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York, the palace said.
   She is the first child of the former Sarah Ferguson and her
husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Britain's newest princess is currently at Balmoral Castle, the
queen's summer home in Scotland, with her parents and grandparents.
   She was born Aug. 8, 1988 at 8:18 p.m., considered one of the
luckiest moments of the century by Chinese astrologers, and flew to
Scotland hours after leaving Portland Hospital in London with her
parents on Aug. 12.
   The name Beatrice _ which means bringer of joy _ has royal
roots. The youngest of Queen Victoria's nine children was named
Princess Beatrice.
   While the duke and duchess were deciding on a name, British
gamblers had a few ideas as well. But their top favorites,
Charlotte, Victoria, Annabel and Elizabeth, all turned out to be
losers.
   The tabloid Sun, Britain's largest-circulation paper, hit the
mark last Friday with a front-page banner headline revealing all
three of the baby's names correctly.
   The paper said Annabel was Andrew and Sarah's first choice but
the name was rejected by the queen as ``too yuppie.'' It said the
queen suggested the name Beatrice during a family gathering at
Balmoral.
   ``It was agreed to be the perfect compromise _ unusual enough to
please Fergie, but royal enough to please the queen,'' The Sun said.
   Princess Beatrice's second name, Elizabeth, is after her
grandmother, the queen, and her great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, who just celebrated her 88th birthday.
   The baby's third name, Mary, is the middle name of the duchess'
mother, Susan Barrantes, wife of Argentinian polo player Hector
Barrantes. It is also the name of Andrew's great-grandmother, Queen
Mary, wife of King George V.
   Taking two weeks to choose a name is not unusual in the royal
family.
   The queen's daughter, Princess Anne and her husband Mark
Phillips took more than three weeks to name their son, Peter, and
almost four weeks to name their daughter, Zara.
   Prince Charles and his wife Diana were comparatively quick to
name their children. Prince William, who is second in line to the
throne behind his father, was named eight days after his birth and
his younger brother, Prince Harry, who is third in line, was named
after 24 hours.
   But Charles himself was referred to as the ``infant son'' for
about a month after he was born on Nov. 14, 1948. His name was
announced the day before his christening on Dec. 14 of that year.

<TEXT>     These rooms and the lifestyles of those who live in and pass through them
are the focus of "Inside Buckingham Palace, The Private World of the Royal
Family" by Andrew Morton (Summit Books, $20). This coffee-table style book,
with its beautiful photographs, is hard to put down, even if you don't follow
all the gossip about the royal family.;   "People see Buckingham Palace as a
personification of mystery and majesty," says Morton, who has spent more than
a decade chronicling the comings and goings of Charles, Diana, Fergie and
all.;   "The palace is the center for national rejoicing and sorrow," he says.
"It was the place people ran to on the day the second World War ended. It's a
national rallying point and the royal family has come to symbolize universal
values of duty, obligation and family life.";   Life inside the palace,
according to Morton, is as different and extreme as any commoner might expect.
It takes three days to set the table for a major banquet, using place settings
valued at $5,400 each, and another three days to wash up. A system of traffic
lights keeps the footmen, pages and butlers who serve and clear from
colliding. And there are two men who do nothing but tend to the winding and
servicing of the 300 clocks in the house.;   There are rooms set aside for
everything from television and radio broadcasts to a bedroom for the queen's
pet corgi dogs. One of the most fascinating is the Gift Room, so-called
because this is where the queen goes to choose gifts she wants to give
someone.;   "It's her own personal shop inside the palace," Morton says.
"Obviously she hasn't time to go shopping. There is lots of porcelain and the
gifts range from the simplest things like a waste basket to little silver
holders you put glasses of tea in.";   Morton divides the interior of the
palace into three areas. "The staff areas are like government offices or the
back rooms of a large hotel, without any glitter or glitz. There are the state
apartments which have polish -- red carpet, mirrors, Regency furniture and
gilt. And the private quarters, which are more comfortable and cozy." The
latter, he says, "contain the kinds of things they like -- pink carnations in
the queen's room and pictures she's chosen herself. Fergie's room has teddy
bears and a helicopter helmet and Fisher-Price toys all over the place.";   In
describing the private areas, Morton makes no attempt to hide his disdain for
the fact that Fergie has almost no closet space. "It's ridiculous -- you have
the premier duchess in the land with her clothes on hangers outside in the
red-carpeted corridor, but she likes Buckingham Palace because it's
comfortable, near her friends, away from prying eyes, and she can enjoy
herself away from the public.";   Authoritative as he is on Buckingham Palace,
Morton's visits have been confined to a narrow area that does not include even
the Centre Room, let alone the private quarters he describes in such vivid
detail.;   "After every book I write, the courtiers have a little inquiry on
how on earth I got such accurate information," he boasts. "It's because of
contacts. I've cultivated people in key positions like any specialist would.";
  Would Morton pay for information?;   He pauses slightly and says, "I'd
haggle.";   A testimony to his sleuthing is the detailed floor plan of the
principal and bedroom floors of the palace. "It's not well-known at all, but I
wanted to print the layout of the private quarters so people could get an idea
of it," he says.;   Morton has yet to hear what the queen or Scotland Yard
thinks about it, but he is pleased to reveal that one of his previous books,
about the Royal Yacht Britannia, was such a hit that "the queen gave lots of
copies away as Christmas presents.";   While they live in lavish surroundings,
the royal family is anything but lavish in their personal spending habits.
"There is no conspicuous consumption in the way of Donald Trump or that
Helmsley woman (Leona)," Morton says. "It's not the kind of family where you
could accuse them of living extravagantly. Everything is of the finest
quality, but they keep whatever they have for a long time, longer than you and
I.";   Fan that he admits he is, Morton still believes the economy kick is
taken too far at times. "It's ridiculous," he says. "You have Diana and Fergie
and the children using a local hotel's swimming pool because the queen hasn't
spent the money on a pool at Balmoral. It's the same at Sandringham. You have
the richest woman in the world not having a swimming pool!";   The pampered
life led by the queen and her family, with someone always there to run the
bath water, lay out their clothes and help them dress, has made them, in
Morton's words, "a bit helpless. They're institutionalized. I don't mean that
in a nasty or negative way. Quite frankly, I'd feel a bit daunted if my day's
schedule said at 10:30 you'll hold an investiture, at noon you'll meet an
ambassador, at 2 you meet the prime minister, at 3 you do a walkabout and that
evening you host a dinner. If you've never done it before in your life, it's
the same way if you've never run a bath or pressed your clothes. They're bred
to a certain kind of function.";   Morton started covering the royal family
while working as a Fleet Street reporter.;   Three years ago Morton gave up
his newspaper job to start Palace Press, which specializes in covering the
royal family. He readily agrees most people view the topic he has chosen as
"very trivial, but once you get into it, it's a very interesting subject
because it touches on many areas of society from an anthropological,
sociological and historical viewpoint.";   While Morton's latest book is on
the palace itself and the lifestyle within the walls, you can't resist asking
his opinion of the constant rumors about Prince Charles and Princess Diana's
marriage.;   "There's always going to be rumors because of the 13-year age
gap," he says. "They have separate interests, a separate circle of friends and
separate timetables. I saw them in Canada, but they didn't seem to be happy.
Only people within a marriage can say how it is from day to day and month to
month."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Newspapers Say Royals Should Give Up Dangerous Pursuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Avalanche-Royals, Bjt

<TEXT>
   Newspapers clamored today for Prince Charles and
other royals to abandon dangerous pursuits after the 39-year-old
heir to the British throne narrowly escaped an avalanche that
killed a close friend.
   ``Charles is the next king .... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   It said Charles as well as Prince Andrew and his wife, the
Duchess of York, took ``unnecessary risks.''
   ``The royals have a duty to play it safe,'' the newspaper added.
   Charles' 28-year-old brother, Andrew, was catapaulted off the
deck of the U.S. carrier Nimitz in a jet fighter when he and the
28-year-old duchess visited the United States last week.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting the
couple's first child in August. She was on a skiing holiday with
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, 26, and friends at Klosters
in the Swiss Alps when the avalanche occurred Thursday. All are
good skiers.
   Sarah, who fell skiing earlier Thursday and was advised to rest,
was with Diana in a chalet when the avalanche struck.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy helicopter co-pilot in the 1982 Falklands
War and now a helicopter instructor, missed the holiday because of
duties at Portland naval based in southwest England.
   The avalanche killed Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, and injured another
friend of the royals, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson.
   Charles, the lead skier, and the rest of his party managed to
evade the avalanche. He helped rescue the unconscious Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, both of whose legs were broken, and then helped
free Lindsay's body from under the snow.
   Another tabloid, The Sun, demanded: ``Why was he there?''
   ``Daredevil Charles has a passion for pushing himself to the
limit on the snow. Each time he dons his skis he likes to shake off
his tag of pampered prince and prove he is a real man ... Charles
has consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes,'' The Sun said.
   Swiss authorities had warned that the area where the royal party
was skiing was prone to avalanches.
   The Sun quoted Alex Broggi, a Klosters ski club owner, as
calling Charles ``incredibly brave.'' Broggi added, ``Many locals
are amazed by the runs he attempts. They wouldn't go anywhere near
them.''
   The Star said in an editorial: ``We don't want our royals to be
wimps ... But advisers who should know better must never again lead
the heir to the throne into such deadly danger.''
   The royals and many of their friends have a pronounced taste for
danger and Charles once asserted: ``If you occasionally live
dangerously it helps you appreciate life.''
   The Daily Mail said: ``The question asked by well-wishers of the
royal family is: Why do so many of them go in for such perilous
sports?'' It urged Queen Elizabeth II to ``ask your offspring, for
the nation's sake, to show just a little more care.''
   Charles' other sports include polo and fox hunting. He has
injured himself several times in falls from his horse at polo.
   His father, Prince Philip, 66, played polo until recently while
the 61-year-old queen is an accomplished horsewoman.
   Princess Anne, 37, the queen's only daughter, goes fox hunting
and occasionally rides in horse races, where accidents are numerous.

   Prince Charles was in ``high
spirits'' today following surgery on his right arm, which was badly
broken when he fell off his horse during a polo match, his
spokesman said.
   But the 41-year-old prince, an avid polo player for 25 years,
will remain hospitalized so doctors can keep an eye on his arm,
spokesman Dickie Arbiter said.
   ``He is in good form and high spirits, chatting away to staff
and doctors, but there will be no departure today,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``There is nothing ominous in no departure today. It is a bad
fracture, a bad break and his arm is swollen,'' Arbiter said.
   Charles underwent a 45-minute operation under general anesthetic
Thursday to set two breaks above the elbow of his right arm. He is
being treated free by the state-run National Health Service.
   Arbiter said the heir to the British throne was in pain today
and had been sedated with painkillers.
   Princess Diana, who celebrates her 29th birthday on Sunday,
spent nearly three hours with her husband this morning.
   Buff Crisp, the secretary of polo's governing body, said a
broken arm is the most common injury suffered by polo players.
   The accident occurred during a polo match at Cirencester Park,
Gloucestershire, seven miles from Highgrove, the country home of
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana. Highgrove is 70 miles west of
London.
   ``The prince was in the process of making a shot when he lost
his balance,'' Arbiter said. ``His horse just trotted away.''
   Diana left during a performance of ``La Boheme'' at the Royal
Opera Thursday night and drove to the hospital just before midnight
to see her husband. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was
informed in Canada where she is visiting.
   Charles was riding his pony, Echo, and playing for his team,
Windsor Park, in the semifinal of the Warwickshire Cup against
Hildon when he fell. Hildon won the match 7-6.
   Charles, who once joked he would continue playing polo ``as long
as I bounce when I fall off,'' lay motionless for some time before
being put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to Cirencester
Memorial Hospital, a witness said.
   David Leahy, head of the local health district, said the prince
told him during a visit that he felt ``jolly lucky'' after the
accident.
   ``He told me it had to happen some time,'' Leahy said. ``He is
extremely cheerful. He is a very stoical man as he must have been
in a great deal of pain.''

Britain's Royal Family has resorted to disguises and aliases to evade the 
prying lenses of the press, but two of its most controversial members have just 
walked into a photographic storm with their eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, and his wife, Sarah, invited a 
photographer into their home to take a set of informal pictures, complete with 
birthday party scenes and beachwear shots. 
</P>
<P>
The photo exclusive of the couple, the Duke and Duchess of York, and their two 
young daughters filled 48 pages of a recent edition of Hello magazine. 
</P>
<P>
But the royal snapshots, accompanied by an article titled "Delightful Moments 
at Home with the Yorks," provoked criticism from friends and foes of the 
monarchy, who accused the couple of making a tasteless show of their private 
life. 
</P>
<P>
It also stoked a long-running debate over whether the more fashionable royals 
damage or strengthen the monarchy by their mass appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The episode is the latest in a series of controversies surrounding the younger 
members of the Royal Family who, in breaking with protocol to make the monarchy 
more accessible, have sometimes been accused of lacking the dignity demanded by 
their high station in life. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, was panned three years ago when 
he persuaded a group of royals to dress up in period costumes and lead teams in 
a televised charity contest. 
</P>
<P>
Flame-haired Sarah, nicknamed "Fergie" after her maiden name of Ferguson, was 
one of those taking part. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has faced more criticism over her spending habits, her 
ranch-style house -- dubbed "Palace Dallas" by British newspapers -- and for 
wearing short skirts that reveal too much royal leg when she gets in and out of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, traditionalists were horrified when Princess Diana, wife of 
Prince Charles, heir to the throne, was caught giving her chauffeur a goodby 
kiss on the cheek after a holiday in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the royals to keep their dignity with the tabloid press 
around. A newspaper once ran a story titled: "20 Things You Did Not Know About 
Prince Charlie's Bald Spot." 
</P>
<P>
Other controversial photographs have surfaced, including one of a pregnant 
Princess Diana in a skimpy bikini. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things added together are leading to a crisis in the monarchy," said 
Harold Brooks-Baker, champion of royal tradition and editor of Britain's 
nobility directory, Burke's Peerage. "If this carries on, it will come 
unstuck." 
</P>
<P>
He was highly critical of the Yorks. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for an ordinary person, these photographs would be unacceptable," he 
said. "Who would want to show pictures of their wife in a sun-dress to anyone 
but very close friends?" 
</P>
<P>
The photographs are no different from average family snapshots. But some 
Britons take offense at the idea of one of the queen's sons and his wife being 
photographed frolicking in a pool and feeding the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess was snapped changing her baby daughter Eugenie's diapers and 
rubbing suntan lotion on 2-year-old Beatrice, who romped naked by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the public was not allowed to see inside the royal households. 
When Queen Elizabeth first admitted the television cameras, her family was clad 
in traditional tweeds and tartans. 
</P>
<P>
Hello editor Maggie Goodman said typical English prudery and snobbery were 
behind the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The public was snapping up copies of the magazine, she said, and newspapers 
that criticized the photographs were just jealous of Hello's exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper said the prince and his wife, the daughter of a polo coach, came 
across like tourists on a cheap holiday. Even the right-leaning Daily Telegraph 
admonished the couple. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice is that the Royal Family should equip themselves with an intelligent 
public relations operator without further delay before irreparable harm is done 
to the monarchy," wrote the Telegraph's Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Family could hardly complain about snooping reporters if they made 
their private lives public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Andrew is no fan of the press. In his bachelor days, he was caught 
vacationing with an actress friend despite traveling under an assumed name. He 
once threw paint over the paparazzi and had to make a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why the couple agreed to the photo session. Goodman said they 
just wanted to share their wedded bliss with the world. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics have spoken of a big fee, a claim firmly denied by Hello magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace, in keeping with royal tradition, offered its customary "no 
comment."

   Nigel Tully is a 45-year-old Londoner. 
See if you can guess what he does for a living. 

   Mr. Tully is a businessman who works with computers and electric guitars. 
Sometimes he wears a pin-stripe suit to work, but often he dresses casually, in an open-collar shirt. 
He travels all over Britain, with occasional forays to the Continent, the Middle East and White Plains, N.Y. 
He frequently works nights, usually starting at about 10 p.m. 
But he works days, too. 
Hint: a rock 'n' roll band is involved. 

   He manages the band, right? 
Yes, but there's more. 
He plays in the band? 
Right again, but keep going. 
He works for IBM? 
You're getting warmer. 
All of the above? 
Bingo. 

   With his Jiminy Cricket spectacles, Nigel Tully looks a bit like Clark Kent, which is appropriate since he leads a double life. 
By day he's an account executive in marketing for IBM (he's handled the British Telecom account for 12 years). 
And at night he grabs his electric guitar, saxophone and harmonica and jives with his five-man rock 'n' roll dance band, the Dark Blues. 

   You probably haven't heard of the Dark Blues, but that just means you haven't attended the right parties. 
The band, formed in 1962 when Mr. Tully was a physics student at Oxford, has played at countless society weddings, debutante parties, bar mitzvahs and hunt balls all over Britain. 
Harpers and Queen, the English society magazine, calls them "Britain's most popular party musicians." 

   They played at Windsor Castle when Princess Anne made her debut in society. 
They played at Buckingham Palace when the Queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. 
And they were back at the palace last November for Prince Charles's 40th birthday party, playing hits by Stevie Wonder, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Michael Jackson. (Mr. 
Tully's drawing room is graced by a framed note from the future king, thanking him for "playing so energetically.") 

   Britain's royals aren't the only bluebloods who boogey to the Dark Blues. 
King Hussein of Jordan flew the band out twice in the late 1970s. 
It played for guests that included the Shah of Iran at the king's private beach in Aqaba near the Israeli border. 
"Israeli radar kept coming through our amplifiers," Mr. Tully recalls. 

   They also played for parties thrown by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Price during his recent stint as U.S. ambassador to Britain. 
Princess Diana attended one and requested the Glenn Miller hit, "In the Mood." 

   "The important thing always is to make people dance," says Mr. Tully, seated in his London home after watching his nine-year-old son play cricket on a non-gig night. 
"What I love is when the crowd wave their arms in the air and shout for more at two o'clock in the morning." 

   The Dark Blues, who perform 120 times a year, usually play "Land of a Thousand Dances," the old James Brown hit, to get people jumping, but with a repertoire of more than 2,000 songs, there's plenty of choice. 
They play everything from Glenn Miller to Madonna, the Supremes to Strauss (the Blue Danube gets dusted off when they need a waltz). 
"We make Bruce Springsteen's sets look short," says Mr. Tully. 

   Among the songs they played at Prince Charles's birthday party were "Rock Around the Clock," "American Pie," "Billie Jean," the old Elton John hit "Your Song" (the singer was at the party), and "God Save the Queen." 

   "We didn't do anything very way out because it was a gentle sort of ball," says Mr. Tully. 
Indeed, the band had learned all the songs on Michael Jackson's "Bad" album, a special favorite of the Princess of Wales, but decided hits like "Dirty Diana" weren't quite right for the occasion. 

   "There are two types of live party bands," says Mr. Tully, turning philosophical. 
"One kind goes on stage and knows exactly what they'll play that night. 
But we never know what we'll play." 
As band leader, Mr. Tully sizes up the crowd, the moment and the mood, then chooses a song that seems appropriate. 

   The songs have changed, but the approach dates from the days when Mr. Tully, a native of Birmingham, formed his first band, The Fourbeats, while a student at Oxford University. 
Like most British rock buffs back then, his idols were American -- James Brown, Roy Orbison, Bo Didley, Otis Redding and Elvis. 

   But Mr. Tully didn't care about writing his own songs or developing his own sound. 
"All I wanted was to reproduce their music as well as I could, note for note," he says. 
And that's what his band has always done. (The name Dark Blues is a pun on Oxford's colors and "the blues.") "I was very, very commercial," says Mr. Tully, who sported bell-bottom trousers and flower-power shirts in the '60s. 
"I wanted applause, I wanted a successful band, and I wanted people to enjoy it." 

   He also wanted to continue playing after Oxford, which was one reason he went to work for IBM upon graduation in 1964. 
Big Blue offered him a job in London, the center of the universe for British party bands, and he has never moved. 

   The bigwigs at IBM, in turn, have never complained about his musical moonlighting or his hair, which was fashionably long in the '70s, at least by rock-music standards. 
The band, which currently gets $2,400 per gig, has played at a number of IBM parties, including a five-day gathering in Morocco for top sales people this summer. 

   Mr. Tully, who is married and has two children, plans to press on with his music, like Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton and other aging rockers of his generation. 
The band already has many confirmed bookings for 1991, including a hunt ball organized by Mr. Tully's wife, Prue. (The couple met in 1975 when Prue hired the Dark Blues to play.) 

   And there's always the chance of another royal engagement, though Mr. Tully insists the last fulfilled the wish of a lifetime. 
Pop singer Phil Collins also performed at Prince Charles's party, and on a souvenir map of Buckingham Palace given to party guests, the Dark Blues received top billing over the famous Mr. Collins. 
Nigel Tully grins. 
"It's my most prized possession."

   Six-year-old Prince William is learning to ski on
the slope where Britain's Olympic loser, Eddie ``the Eagle''
Edwards, made his first faltering leap to fame, the manager of the
ski center said Thursday.
   William has taken three lessons on the dry ski slope at the
Gloucester Ski Center near Highgrove, his family's country home west
of London, said Dave Watson.
   William is second in line to the British throne behind his
father, Prince Charles.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, are accomplished skiiers,
and Diana recently disclosed her older son ``loves skiing.''
   Edwards soared to fame in the Winter Olympics by finishing last
in two ski jumping events. Fans fell in love with his thick glasses,
jutting chin and unflappable humor.

   Actor Gary Busey, recovering from head
injuries suffered in a motorcycle crash, was out of intensive-care
unit as his condition continued to improve.
   Busey, 44, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his
starring role in ``The Buddy Holly Story'' in 1978, hit his head on
a curb after being thrown from his Harley Davidson motorcycle
Sunday. He underwent 90 minutes of brain surgery after the crash.
   Busey, a Malibu resident, was moved to a regular hospital room
from the intensive-care unit Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, where he remained in serious condition, spokesman Ron Wise
said.
   ``He's really far along for somebody who had his kind of brain
surgery only three days ago,'' Wise said.
   The actor was expected to make a complete recovery, Wise said
earlier.
   Busey, who wasn't wearing a helmet during the crash, has
campaigned against efforts to pass a California law requiring all
motorcycle riders and passengers to wear helmets.
   Lt. Ellis Smith said a helmet probably would have protected Busey
from head injury, adding, ``I don't think even the helmet would have
been broken.''

   Prince Harry came to the rescue Thursday when a shy
co-star forgot her lines in their kindergarten Nativity play.
   The 4-year-old son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was
playing a shepherd and had just uttered his lines ``in a very
confident voice'' when a classmate playing another shepherd forgot
hers, said a Buckingham Palace spokesman who was in the audience.
   The prince stepped closer, whispered the forgotten lines into her
ear, and the show went on, said the spokesman, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British custom.
   Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife, Diana, were in
the audience for their son's first speaking role. Harry played a
goblin in his school play last year, but it was a silent part.

   Matilda Cuomo, wife of Gov. Mario Cuomo, is
in a court fight over her father's will.
   Mrs. Cuomo and two of her siblings are battling their mother and
two other brothers over where the will of Charles Raffa will be
probated and who should be the executor of the $13.7 million estate.
   A Nassau County Surrogate Court judge set Jan. 5 for a hearing.
He also ordered on Wednesday that the temporary executor, Sam Raffa,
one of the three sons, not dispose of any property.
   Raffa claims he was named executor in a will codicil made in 1984
shortly after his father was severely beaten during a mugging.
Charles Raffa never recovered and died Oct. 19, 1988.
   Sam Raffa also wants the will probated in Nassau County. His
mother, Mary, and brother, Frank, have sided with him.
   Matilda Cuomo, along with her sister Nancy Mazzola and brother,
Joseph, want to use an executor named in a 1977 will. They want the
will validated in Brooklyn, where they said their father lived most
of his life.
   ``This is not a split in the family,'' Mrs. Mazzola said. ``We're
just trying to make some decisions.''
   But Sam Raffa said in a court affidavit that trying to remove him
as executor was ``part of a plan to eventually attack the provisions
of my father's will.''

<HEAD>Poll Says 82 Percent Of Britons Support Monarchy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of five Britons remain firmly royalist but
nearly 60 percent think Queen Elizabeth II should step down to allow
her eldest son Prince Charles to become king, according to an
opinion poll published today.
   The Gallup poll, published in The Daily Telegraph newspaper,
reported 82 percent of those questioned said they were in favor of
the British monarchy, just 14 percent wanted it abolished and the
rest expressed no opinion.
   But 59 percent said they thought the 62-year-old queen should
``retire'' early, allowing 40-year-old Charles to become king.
   Because of the disgrace surrounding the abdication in 1936 of the
queen's uncle King Edward VIII, later the Duke of Windsor, in order
to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, the queen has said she
will never abdicate the throne.
   This could mean a long wait for Charles. His
great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII, had to wait until he was
59 years old before he succeeded to the thone in 1901 on the death
of his mother, Queen Victoria, at age 81.
   Charles, whose concern for the poor, homeless and what he regards
as the uglier aspects of modern architecture have won him widespread
public support, heads the list of most popular royals, according to
the poll. It said 21 percent of those questioned said Charles was
their favorite.
   A 75-minute television documentary made by the prince attacking
many modern buildings as ugly was screened by the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Oct. 28. A newspaper survey at the time said
75 percent of Britons agreed with him.
   In today's poll, 19 percent of respondents said Elizabeth the
Queen Mother, Charles' 88-year-old grandmother, was their favorite;
17 percent favored his 38-year-old sister Princess Anne; 12 percent
liked his 27-year-old wife Princess Diana best; and 11 percent liked
the queen most.
   Despite the overwhelming support for the monarchy, 40 percent of
presondents said they thought the $9.45 million in taxpayers' money
paid last year to support the royals was too much.
   The queen, one of the world's richest people, has a personal
fortune estimated earlier this year by the London business
publication Money Magazine at $6 billion. But she and some other
royals also receive an annual grant of taxpayers' money voted by
Parliament to help them with the cost of their official duties,
upkeep of palaces and other expenses.
   Asked whether they themselves would want to be members of the
royal family, 89 percent of those questioned in the poll said no.
   The poll was based on interviews with 918 people around Britain.
It stated no margin of error.

   The Princess of York, newborn daughter of the Duke
and Duchess of York, is fifth in line the British throne now
occupied by her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   The baby girl born Monday night is far enough away from the
ancient seat not to have to train seriously for it as her Uncle
Charles, the first in line, did.
   Charles' 6-year-old son, Prince William of Wales, is destined to
be king after his father and will no doubt have to study for the
role more diligently than younger brother Prince Harry, almost 4,
the third in line.
   The baby's father, 28-year-old Prince Andrew, the Duke of York
and second son of the queen, is fourth in line as long as Charles
and his wife, Diana, have no other children to push Andrew further
down the list.
   The baby princess is officially Her Royal Highness Princess of
York.
   Her place in the line will change if her parents have a son, who
would be placed ahead of her, or if the Prince and Princess of
Wales have a daughter or another son.
   The new York baby pushes Prince Edward, 24, the queen's third
son, back to sixth place, and 37-year-old Anne _ her only daughter
and second-eldest child, back to seventh place.
   Anne's children _ Peter Phillips, 10, and Zara Phillips, 7 _ are
eighth and ninth in line. They are not a prince and princess, nor
are they designated royal highnesses, because Anne's husband,
equestrian champion Mark Phillips, has no royal title.
   The queen's 57-year-old sister, Princess Margaret, the Countess
of Snowdon, is 10th in line followed by her children, Viscount
Linley, 26, and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, 24, in 11th and 12th
place.
   The order of succession then shifts to the queen's cousins: the
Duke of Gloucester and his three children, the Duke of Kent and two
of his three children, and the two children of his brother Prince
Michael of Kent, who lost his own place by marrying a Roman
Catholic. The Duke of Kent's eldest son also lost his place in the
line of succession because he married a Catholic.
   The Kent brothers' sister, Princess Alexandra and her two
children are next.

   Prince Charles escaped an avalanche
while skiing today, but the snowslide killed one of his friends and
injured another.
   Buckingham Palace identified the dead man as Maj. Hugh Lindsay,
a former equerry, or aide, to Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II.
A woman in the party, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries, the palace said.
   The palace said Charles was not injured. But witnesses said the
prince looked distraught, and one said he was weeping and shaking
as a helicopter arrived to pick him up.
   Charles' wife, Diana, and Sarah Ferguson, his pregnant
sister-in-law, were not on the slopes at the time, the palace said.
   Swiss authorities said the snowslide on Mt. Gotschnagrat near
Klosters began about 300 feet above a group of six skiers that
included Prince Charles. The prince and three other people were
unharmed.
   The palace said the party was skiing off the main ski run and
was stationary when the avalanche began at 2:45 p.m.
   ``All members of the party were in a position to take avoiding
action with the exception of Maj. Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, who were both caught in the avalanche,'' it said.
   Lindsay, 34, was a serving army major and a friend of Charles
and Diana. He was married to a Buckingham Palace press secretary
who was expecting a baby, the palace said.
   Peter Balsiger, editor-in-chief of the Zurich-based newspaper
Blick, was quoted as saying he was told Charles, 39, helped dig one
person out of the snow.
   The palace statement said a Swiss guide and members of the royal
party helped dig the victims free. It did not say whether Charles
was among the diggers.
   A French photographer told BBC radio he saw Charles being
comforted by someone as a helicopter took off with a stretcher.
   BBC TV news said the queen was understood to have spoken to the
family at the chalet where they gathered after the tragedy.
   The 1988 Good Ski Guide describes the run where the accident
occurred as ``a slope of awesome steepness, dropping about 500
meters (yards).''
   Prince Charles skied the area many times during his bachelor
days and is credited with giving Klosters its exclusive tag.
   The guide says: ``Prince Charles is no doubt pleased to have put
(it) behind him; mercifully it is rarely open.''
   ``They (avalanches) are extremely difficult to predict. That is
what makes them so dangerous,'' said Peter Cliff, an Alpine guide
and leader of the Cairngorm mountain rescue team in Scotland.
   The most common is the snow-slab avalanche, when snow driven by
wind creates a crusted surface, underlaid with air pockets, and is
liable to fracture across the entire width of a slope.
   Without warning, massive slides can be set off by temperature
increases, new falls of snow or skiers and climbers.
   The royals arrived in Switzerland on Tuesday.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York, who is married to
Charles' younger brother Prince Andrew, posed for photographers at
Klosters on Wednesday for photographers. The 28-year-old duchess,
the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.

   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II begins
her annual tour Monday of Scotland, but her family outing will be
missing a few members.
   The Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of York bowed out
Sunday as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived in the Scottish
capital on their way to the Palace at Holyroodhouse.
   Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, is a naval officer and joined
his new ship, the HMS Edinburgh. The Duchess, the former Sarah
Ferguson, is expecting their first child and did not make the trip.
   Princess Diana has official duties in Cornwall and will not join
Prince Charles when he travels Thursday to Scotland.
   The Queen and Prince Philip, meanwhile, were scheduled Monday to
visit the Royal Navy at its base in Rosyth, north of Edinburgh.
Along with Charles and Princess Anne, they will carry out more than
40 official engagements during the weeklong stay.

<TEXT>
   The Princess of Wales, visiting the Big Apple for
the first time, will attend a gala performance of the Welsh National
Opera, promote British exports from cashmere to toys and meet with
children suffering from AIDS.
   The princess was to arrive this afternoon for her three-day
whirlwind tour of the city, during which she will meet the city's
social elite as well as its sick and homeless.
   Princess Diana's last visit to the United States was in 1985,
when she and her husband, Prince Charles, went to the White House.
   The princess is traveling alone this time and will stay in an
$1,800-a-night suite at the Plaza Athenee.
   The highlight of the visit will be the American debut Thursday
night of the Welsh National Opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
She is patron of the opera company.
   Following the black-tie, $1,000-a-seat benefit performance of
Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' the 850 ticket holders will have dinner with
Diana.
   Diana _ the mother of Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4 _
also plans to take over F.A.O. Schwarz, the posh Fifth Avenue toy
store, to announce an exposition next month of British-made toys,
children's apparel and other goods.
   The princess will then turn her attention to the city's less
fortunate children with a trip Thursday morning to a day-care
program and a homeless shelter.
   On Friday morning, she will go to Harlem Hospital to visit
children suffering from AIDS. She is scheduled to leave that
afternoon.
   Supporters of the Irish Republican Army have planned protests to
mark Diana's visit, including a demonstration at Thursday night's
opera.

Prince and Princess of Wales sounds less like a story spun by Hans Christian
Andersen than one crafted by the Brothers Grimm.;    Casting Prince Charles as

TEN YEARS AFTER THEIR STORYBOOK WEDDING,
DIANA AND CHARLES ARE LIVING SEPARATE LIVES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Truth or twaddle, there's little doubt that things have changed since that
sultry Wednesday morning of July 29, 1981, when America roused itself in the
wee hours to catch a bleary eyeful of a shy, blond stalk of a girl marrying
her Prince Charming.;    She wasn't Cinderella, but Lady Diana Spencer came
close, right down to the glass wedding coach, drawn by prancing horses and
flanked by plumed-helmeted outriders. A pedigreed capillary of an English
bloodline even bluer than the Windsors', Diana never played scullery maid to
her rather high-handed stepmother, but she reportedly cleaned houses briefly
after dropping out of finishing school. A long-stemmed, porcelain-skinned
beauty under a charmingly ragged mop of sunny hair, she stood on the balcony
of Buckingham Palace, blushed and kissed Prince Charles to the approving roar
of delighted subjects.;    This prettiest of pictures begged for the caption:
"And they lived happily ever after.";    On New Year's Day 1991, another
picture, taken on a windswept stretch of the Norfolk coast, seemed to tell
another story: Diana was photographed not kicking up her heels on her
husband's arm at some bright soiree, but dejectedly kicking at the surf,
alone, on a desolate beach seven miles from the queen's Sandringham estate,
where the family was gathered for the holidays.;    Said Jim Bennett, the
astonished free-lance photographer who snapped the shot, "In all my years of
covering the royal family, I have never seen any one of them out at such a
lonely place without at least three policemen.";    Perhaps that is because no
one in the royal family has ever been in quite the place Diana finds herself
these days.;    In many ways, it has less to do with the apparently fraying
state of a storybook marriage than with the fact that she and Charles are the
future rulers of England. As such, they are in a class by themselves, a simple
fact but one with endless complications that, under the best of circumstances,
make it a rather lonely place indeed.;    Inevitably, almost from the
beginning, there were predictions of rifts in the match between the bubbly, if
untutored, former kindergarten teacher and the sophisticated, if gloomily
intellectual, heir to the throne.;    There was the 12-year age gap. She
bopped to Phil Collins, he mused to Mozart. She thrilled to Danielle Steel, he
pondered Carl Jung. She shopped, he fished. She hated horses, he lived for
polo. By her own reported admission, she was "thick as a plank," while he will
be the most-educated king ever to rule Britain. She was high-spirited, he was
a young fogey.;    Unexpected role reversal;  In 10 years, their tastes
haven't changed much, but the Waleses themselves have. In fact, in the eyes of
the world, Diana and Charles have undergone a spectacularly unexpected role
reversal.;    Demure, sheltered and unsullied by the world, Diana at 20 was
the quintessential virgin bride, a status of increasing rarity, but, according
to her rather indiscreet father, a condition confirmed by prenuptial medical
examination. This was a very old-fashioned girl.;    Then the transformation
began, each stage slavishly chronicled and labeled by the world media. Shy Di,
she of the nail-bitten fingers and nervous giggles, quickly became Disco Di, a
leather-skirted featherbrain who danced through the palace halls with a
Walkman clamped to her empty head. Dynasty Di soon followed, with big hair,
bigger shoulder pads and a co-starring role, with sister-in-law Fergie, as the
sort of merry wives of Windsor who poked passersby with parasols at Royal
Ascot.;    But in the last year, Dutiful Di, a designation some see as more
resigned, as well as more regal, has taken over. Diana, already patron of
about 50 charities, most of them having to do with children or substance
abuse, recently added service to the National AIDS Trust to her list of good
deeds. In fact, the princess caused headlines by pointedly shaking the hand of
an AIDS patient, a move one observer called probably the "single most
important thing done by a royal in the last 200 years.";    Royal
canonization;  Making an increasingly heavy number of royal appearances,
always scheduled carefully around the school plays and other needs of her two
young princes, Diana seems headed for the sort of royal canonization reserved
for the venerably bouncy Queen Mother.;    Ironically, Diana's ascent into
regal impeccability has been matched by her husband's descent into an
increasingly crabby dottiness that most recently bordered on disgrace.;   
Absent during son's surgery;  Earlier this month, when young Prince William,
8, got his royal skull fractured by a schoolmate brandishing a golf club, both
parents rushed to the hospital. Diana remained at William's bedside for 18
straight hours.;    But even before the little prince was wheeled into
surgery, Charles had rushed off to the opera and then left London for North
Yorkshire, where he was due at an environmental conference.;    To some, this
was simply the stiff-upper-lip-and-carry-on royal tradition at work in
Charles.;    Nonetheless, this did not go down well with the British press,
which berated the absent Charles with such headlines as "What Kind of Dad Are
You?" Last week, People magazine joined in the Charles-bashing with a scathing
coverline -- "Once Again, England Asks, 'Where's Poppa?' " -- and story
tallying the heir to the throne's paternal lapses over recent months.;    No
more man of action;  Where Charles finds himself these days is in a far
different place than he was 10 years ago.;    The debonair, if sometimes dour,
bachelor prince who leapt out of helicopters, scored death-defying polo goals
and romanced leggy starlets like some combination of James Bond and Don Juan
has traded in his action-man image. Though doubtlessly sobered by his own
brush with death during a 1988 Swiss skiing accident that killed his friend
Maj. Hugh Lindsay, and a serious polo accident last year, Charles these days,
according to the British press, is more like "missing in action," detached not
only from the lives of his wife and children, but from modern life itself.;   
As heir to the throne, Charles grew up in the glare of public scrutiny, a
pressure some believed was lessened by the arrival of Diana. But what may have
begun as relief seems to have evolved into a sort of retreat.;    Often takes
trips by himself;  The current Charles, an elusive, moodily Byronic figure
with overtones of Thoreau, tends to take solitary sketching treks to the
Kalahari Desert, painting trips to Italy and monthlong fishing forays, alone,
at Balmoral, the queen's castle in Scotland.;    He frets about the
environment, holistic medicine, spiritualism, architecture, agriculture and
the state of his personal garden at the couple's country estate, Highgrove, in
Gloucestershire.;    There, where he reportedly spends most of the week
tending to flowers and organic vegetables, while Diana and the boys remain in
London, the prince is said to while away countless hours behind the
7-foot-high walls of his secret garden, happily troweling by flashlight after
sundown.;    "A-Loon Again," crowed the tabloid Sun of Charles' horticultural
passions. To be fair, through the years, the prince, stuck in a holding
pattern for the throne, has tried to find ways to make himself useful.
Unfortunately, most of them, like his gardening, have tended to backfire by
making him look rather loopy.;    Thus, it seemed the gesture of either an
understanding or cynical wife when Diana recently gave Charles a
gilt-finished, crown-shaped outdoor lamp to illuminate his garden. A London
newspaper quoted a palace source as saying that not only does this thoughtful
gift eliminate the need for Charles to keep replacing the batteries in his
flashlights, but "he can stay in the garden until midnight now if he wants."; 
  This romantic pronouncement was matched only by a reported palace statement
that the prince and the princess, contrary to media speculation, spend at
least three nights a week together.;    Man without a job;  Charles would seem
made for gloom. By nature, his long Windsor face wears a sour, pinched look,
which, in fairness, may be more the fault of genetics than temperament.;   
The prince's mood would probably sweeten if he had a job; not just any job,
but the job he has been groomed for since his birth 42 years ago. Because that
job is usually available only upon the death of its holder, Charles has a
problem.;    The subject of endless debate in British circles, the possible
abdication of the queen in favor of her son remains only that, a possibility,
and a dim one at that. There was a brief flurry of speculation this year, when
Elizabeth turned 65 -- what many considered to be a proper and dignified time
for her to step down -- but she's still on the throne, in good health and
showing no sign of leaving.;    If there ever is to be a coronation, there
certainly can never be a divorce. If there were to be, Charles could stop
pruning his roses right now, because British law forbids the accession of a
divorced person to the throne. With divorce out of the question, other, less
drastic but more practical solutions have sprung to the minds of those in the
media.;    Royal arrangements;  Royal marriages that degenerate into royal
arrangements are hardly unknown. A flutter of whispers that Diana was carrying
on with a dashing investment banker, Philip Dunne, a few years ago fell on
shocked ears. After all, she was the mother of two, and an affair with the
future queen would be tantamount to treason.;    On the other hand, Charles
would probably benefit from a royal double standard traditionally observed in
such delicate matters.;    There have been rumors in recent years that his
relationships with such old friends as dress designer Lady "Kanga" Tryon are
more than friendships.;    As recently as this month, People magazine pointed
an accusing finger at yet another "other woman," this time Charles' former
flame Camilla Parker Bowles.;    Reprimands from the queen;  Rumors are one
thing, but even the appearance of estrangement or marital woes, which has
cropped up several times in a marriage featuring weeks of physical separation,
is dicey and reportedly has earned the Waleses reprimands from the queen.;   
Fact is the Waleses spend less and less time together, even when they're in
the same place.;    The separate-bedrooms claim, put forth by an overly chatty
former security guard at Highgrove, came in the wake of Diana's own
pronouncement on future pregnancies. In short she said she was "sticking with
two" children.;    Two is probably all she can manage if Charles continues to
absent himself from family outings. In April, the princess took her two sons
on an Austrian ski vacation without Charles, who went fishing at Balmoral. The
same month, she took them to Thorpe Park, and again, Charles was absent.;   
In March, it was Diana, not known for her love of horses, who took her boys to
a riding competition in Gloucestershire. Though only a few miles away at
Highgrove, the prince stayed home.;    When the Waleses jetted off to Brazil
on an official visit in April, the British press noted, it was the first time
the couple had been seen together in public in 22 days.;    There, while the
princess cuddled with schoolchildren, the prince, according to one British
press account, "lovingly" planted a Brazilian nut tree, "patted it" and
"wished it good luck.";    The same wish might be extended to their next
decade together. It looks as if they will need it.  </TEXT>

   Flu struck down Princess Diana, wife of the heir
to the British throne, forcing her to miss one church service over
the weekend, Buckingham Palace said.
   The princess was absent when her husband, Prince Charles,
parents-in-law Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and other
royals worshiped at the church Sunday on the family's estate in
Norfolk.
   But Diana, 28, did attend a service Christmas Day, accompanied
by sons Willliam and Harry and other family members.
   Britain has been swept by an unusually severe flu epidemic in
recent weeks.

FT  10 JUL 93 / Superstar route for royalty: John Lloyd has been ploughing
through the torrent of books on the British monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE books about the British monarchy published in the first half of this
year, the majority advertise in their titles that they are diagnoses of
sickness, even death.
Two proclaim the fall of the House of Windsor. One gets 'behind palace
doors.' Another borrows law court language - Diana v Charles - to emphasise
the hectic distaste which the Prince and Princess of Wales conceived for
each other. A fifth sees the crown as 'tarnished.' A sixth boldly
psychoanalyses the family. A seventh homes in upon the royal marriages with
the ruthless eye of the scandal-monger.
The books are themselves a pathology, for the four journalist-authors -
Nigel Dempster/Peter Evans, Anthony Holden and James Whitaker - were all
scribe-courtiers of, even fawners on, their subjects. Now they take the
insouciant high ground of the scornful know-all, seeing 'nothing but
lechery' wherever they look.
For the writer A N Wilson, the most disdainful of them, the behaviour of
Charles, above all, has been a betrayal of trust. Wilson is forced to
suggest an unlikely alienation of the monarchy from the Windsor family in
order to preserve it.
One of the two Ladies writing, Lady Colin Campbell, is a distant relation by
marriage to the British royal family and to 'most of the royal houses of
Europe,' and is bitchily revelatory, whisking aside bedroom curtains across
a continent and four generations.
The one academic, a former Labour politician turned radical, Stephen
Haseler, sees the pass to which sex has brought the monarchy as the starting
point for his vigorous, neo-conservative republicanism.
Other critical books have been published since the second world war - that
is, in the period when the royal family became the Holy Family (a myth
started not by the present Queen but by her mother, that hard nut with a
creamy, sweet coating). But Percy Black's Mystique of Modern Royalty and
Kingsley Martin's Crown and Establishment, for example, were chiding, not
radical.
In the late 1980s, two books were published which, although resigned to the
continuation of popular sycophancy, nevertheless began to strike chords. The
doughty republican Edgar Wilson's Myth of the British Monarchy appeared in
1989. More stylish was the Scots Marxist Tom Nairn's book, The Enchanted
Glass (1988). It was a meditation on royalty and its acceptance in British
public and fantasy life.
It was good stuff, but what else would you expect from a Scots Marxist? The
fact that it attracted attention was not due to left-wing agitation but to
something quite different: to the best impulses of Thatcherism - a
dispassionate and undeferential questioning of the way we organise
ourselves. This questioning left its mark everywhere, and has permitted some
curious alliances in the 1990s - as on royalty. Linked to this was the
growing lack of inhibition of the popular press.
Although they prepared the ground, the Thatcherites retreated from it
because deference was still too strong in their bones. The most radical of
them - Keith Joseph, Norman Tebbit, David Young and Margaret Thatcher
herself - all in the end were too bourgeois to press the logic they had
unleashed. They bowed the knee and took the peerage route into the
decompression chamber of British public life.
Behind them, however, they left a right-radical popular press, led by The
Sun, without the restraining influence of the leader herself. In the past
two years the press has launched attacks more forcefully and promiscuously
than ever before, reaching deep into previously taboo heartland. The medium
for this travel into the forbidden zone was sex. These books, with the
exception of that written by the Roundhead Haseler, are full of it.
This is natural enough. The British monarchy has much more of a duty to
reproduce than to rule. Alone among the state functionaries of Britain, the
monarch's sex life can be reasonably said to be of public interest.
The lamp of the media's attention has been hottest on Charles: he has
melted, though not completely. Most of the books, especially Holden's and
Wilson's, view the prince with real contempt, ridiculing his intellectual
pretensions, his vacillation over marriage and his finally surly resignation
in marrying.
Whitaker, with the wariness of a tabloid reporter who cannot afford to
offend a future king - although he, as the others, doubts that Charles will
now make it - is less censorious. He makes the even-handed, sad comment that
'put at its crudest it came to this: he needed someone to produce a future
king, she desperately wanted to be Princess of Wales.' On balance he prefers
the princess with whom, on his account, he has had a number of
heart-to-hearts, especially just before the wedding - conversations which
were clearly of great value (financially as well as emotionally) to him.
The male authors all agree that the princess was ready to love, but that she
ran up against Charles' desire to carry on with a routine of duty,
philosophising, polo, fishing and, ultimately, adultery.
In a soupy pre-marriage interview, both Charles and Diana were asked if they
were in love. She simpered assent. He gave his, then added: 'Whatever love
means.' Since that was not part of the wedding-of-the-epoch script, it was
made little of. However, today's republicans-come-lately see it as the
emotional viper in the bosom of the marriage.
Diana, already sanctified by Andrew Morton's Diana - a powerful and mythic
work - has a much better time of it from the authors. All note her dimness,
her ambition and, by far her most important characteristic, her
chameleon-like nature.
With tabloid economy, Whitaker puts it best: 'She had a knack for picking up
the gestures that define a personality.' Holden, quoting the US author
Camilla Paglia, says that Diana 'may have become the most powerful image in
the world today, a case study in the modern cult of celebrity and the way in
which it stimulates atavistic religious emotions.' And he lists the
stereotypes at which she now takes a turn: 'Cinderella, betrayed wife,
princess in the tower, mater dolorosa, pagan goddess, Hollywood queen and
beautiful boy.'
Lady Campbell is the notable dissenter from the general view that the
princess is the more sinned against. She has written a magnificent book
whose veracity it is completely impossible to determine, though her blood
ties to the royal families of Britain and Europe would in nobler times have
removed any doubt as to her word.
She is in every bed chamber, including that of the queen and the many
occupied by the Duke of Edinburgh. Of Charles, she believes that a man in
his position will, after the duty is done, take a mistress or mistresses.
Diana's inability to tolerate this appears to her 'irrational and childish.'
She presents the princess as a tantrum-prone bully without the intelligence
to grasp what was expected of her and the stakes for which she was gambling.
Of course, the famous 'Camillagate' (Prince Charles) and 'Squidgy' (Diana)
tapes are represented in both Dempster's and Whitaker's book. The tapes'
contents are well known. I found the Prince's conversation touching to the
point of feeling a stab of sympathy for him, and Diana's deportment while
she was being grossly flattered by James Gilbey unnervingly self-controlled
and narcissistic.
Can the greatest surviving monarchy on earth live through this? As rational
British citizens, we must hope not. But we must also - knowing the depth of
its cunning, the rotundity of its purse and the reserves of popularity it
still commands - fear that it can.
The answer to its survival lies with Diana. In her embrace of stardom and in
her ability to lend herself to a series of pre-determined images  -
especially of the 'caring' sort now so much in vogue - she has mapped out a
route that her sister-in-law, Princess Anne, has already discovered in a
lower-key way.
The British royal family can survive as charity superstars. They must be
ruthless with their ceremonial, trimming it to what is amusing and splendid
on occasion. They must open up not just Buckingham Palace but all the
palaces, including the so-called 'private possessions' like Balmoral and
Sandringham - in reality, as Holden writes, the product of Queen Victoria's
adroit begging for public finance. And they must open all the art and other
collections.
They must create, probably outside London, the largest and best designed

that clever accountancy is not the option for them that it is for most of

   Hollywood legend Bette Davis says
disagreements with the director forced her to flee the set of her
latest film, ``Wicked Stepmother,'' for ``the good of my future
career.''
   The 80-year-old actress said director Larry Cohen was
unresponsive to her suggestions and unwilling to make changes. After
one week of filming, she flew to New York where she stayed for
several weeks, recuperating from dental surgery. But she decided not
to return.
   ``He never rehearses actors,'' she complained in Tuesday's
editions of the Los Angeles Times. ``He just rehearses the camera.
So we work for the camera. I was very uncomfortable in all the
scenes he had me play in that week.''
   ``People will be horrified at the footage on me,'' Miss Davis
said. ``I think that for the good of my future career I honestly had
no choice'' but to go public with the story.
   Cohen called Miss Davis a ``wonderful'' woman and dismissed the
criticisms, saying the cast spent hours rehearsing at his home.

   Actress Jane Seymour says she's sticking her
neck out by allowing her son and daughter to play the children of
Marie Antoinette because the movie in which she portrays the French
queen is ``extraordinary.''
   In a deal with the producers, Miss Seymour said Tuesday, she
secured roles for her daughter, Katie, 6, and son Sean, 3, as Louis
Charles and Marie Therese, who were imprisoned with their mother.
   ``I would normally keep my children away from this kind of thing.
If it was a sit-com or a weekly series, I would never let them do
it,'' the actress said.
   ``But this is something extraordinary and historic. It's a huge
definitive version of the French Revolution and provides them with a
marvelous opportunity to learn a little French and understand the
history, too,'' Miss Seymour said from her home in Bath.
   She gave no details of the deal with the producers.
   The film in French and English, tentatively called ``The French
Revolution,'' will be shot in Paris and Versailles for release in
October to mark this year's bicentennial of the French Revolution.
Marie Antoinette and her husband, King Louis XVI, were sent to the
guillotine in 1793.
   Miss Seymour starred in the ABC-TV miniseries ``War and
Remembrance'' and last year played the Duchess of Windsor and opera
diva Maria Callas.

British Virgin Islands while Prince Charles stays in England.
   Emerging from a chartered plane Tuesday in sunny, 85-degree
weather, Diana wore a sleeveless, flowered pink dress. Sons Prince
William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4, wore shorts.
   They were vacationing with Diana's mother, Frances Shand-Kydd,
and sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, and the
sisters' four children.
   ``This is private holiday treat which Mrs. Shand-Kydd has planned

``Everything is just dandy.
   ``I have, from all over the world, received congratulatory

   The Great Dane, who gained worldwide fame by punctuating his

   ``That I'm not dead,'' he replied.
   More seriously, he said, ``I think it's in the genes. Just good

   Borge added that he still has the energy to do his quota of 75 to

that grows and grows, and every year the fruit appears. And I just

   A beaming Prince Andrew welcomed Princess Diana
and her two sons with kisses and hugs when they arrived at Portland
Hospital on Wednesday for the first glimpse of the newest addition
to the royal family.
   Andrew's wife, Sarah, the Duchess of York, gave birth Monday
night to their first child, the still-unnamed Princess of York.
Mother and daughter are ``very well,'' Buckingham Palace said.
   Coral Bookmakers offered short odds on the princess being named
Charlotte, although British newspapers speculated Annabel, Victoria
and Elizabeth were also possible choices.
   More than 100 well-wishers cheered as Diana and her sons,
Princes William and Harry, arrived for their brief visit.
   It is not known when the duchess and baby will leave hospital,
although Andrew must return to his Royal Navy duties in the Far
East next week.
   The palace confirmed the duchess was expected to take the baby
to Balmoral Castle in Scotland ``at some stage'' this summer to see
her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   Andrew is the queen's second-oldest son and the baby is her
fifth grandchild.

   Prince William, 7-year-old son of heir-to-the

Buckingham Palace said.
   William is to attend Ludgrove School in Berkshire county, 10
miles from the Windsor Castle country home of his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth II, and 35 miles from his parents' London home at
Kensington Palace.
   William, who will be 8 by the time he starts at Ludgrove, has
been attending Wetherby School in London.
   The choice of the 186-student school is a break with family
tradition. Charles attended Cheam Preparatory School, as did his
father, Prince Philip.
   Buckingham Palace announced Friday that Ludgrove had been the
``joint parental choice'' of Charles and his wife, Diana.
   Another royal offspring, 15-month-old Princess Beatrice, took
her first trip abroad, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
   Her mother, Sarah, the Duchess of York, slipped quietly out of
the country for a private vacation in Australia with her elder
sister, Jane. The Duke of York, Prince Andrew, is taking a
refresher course in England as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.

The 'Charles and Diana' story is the opium of the people. It attracts
immense interest in most countries, but at home it does more. In Britain,
gossip about the private life of the scions of the House of Windsor is an
obsession of the tabloids, a quick-seller for the serious newspapers,
dominant on the airwaves, an easy topic of conversation, the stuff of
fantasy and scribblers' invention, marginal, fluffy, inconsequential - and,
as such, a substitute for thought, a painkiller for a bewildered national
psyche. It is, in short, a constant distraction from genuine problems of
governance, evidence of a polity thrashing around for a sense of purpose.
The latter is the serious element in an essentially unserious flow of media
pap. It may be that this flow has latterly been stimulated by the heir to
the throne and his estranged wife, but that is beside the point. The British
people approach the end of the 20th century as uncertain about their role in
the world as at any time since the end of empire. Historians will be
justified if they label it the century of moral decline.
The final decade is already looking inglorious. A prize for literature is
awarded to a 'novel' widely acknowledged to be illiterate. A fund is set up
to spend the proceeds of a national lottery on celebrating the millennium,
but no one, not even the minister in charge, has articulated a clear idea of
what that means, or what there is to celebrate. At a conference of the
governing party, a yob makes a successful bid for the front pages by lifting
his kilt for the cameras.
We affect to be shocked, but our sensibilities are numbed. Nothing is
sacred, least of all religion. There is some tut-tutting when a clergyman is
dismissed for professing a lack of belief in God. Several of our television
comedians appear to be motivated by a militant, even spiteful, atheism. The
end of deference may be welcome, but in its place has come - a void. We
revel in titillating accounts of the sexual misdemeanours of this or that
government minister and affect surprise when we hear that various officials,
elected and appointed, appear to have been lining their own pockets, or
allowing their relatives to do so. We live in the kingdom of Grab, an empty
commonwealth in which, when financial fiddles are revealed, some wonder
whether the misdemeanour lies in the act, or the getting caught.
In such a world, prattle about whether the monarchy will survive the war of
the royal books is mere escapism. Prince Charles and Princess Diana have
been subsumed into the production line of the media; they have become its
primary raw material, second only to paper. They are the prince and princess
of publishing. Their original image, that of the shyly spooning couple, was
a romantic fiction in the preparation of which they connived. They are now
assisting in the manufacture of the salacious prose that may diminish or
possibly even destroy one or both of them.
Does it matter? At the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth last
week the senior minister at our dining-table was asked what he made of it
all. 'You are addressing the wrong person,' came the reply. 'I give little
thought to these things. All we need to know is that most voters are
monarchists. Nearly all of them hold the Queen in high regard. End of
story.'
Mr John Major concurs. 'I think the monarchy has got its roots sunk so deep
in the affairs of the people of this country that it is very sound and
secure,' the prime minister said yesterday. His confidence is supported by
precedent. Two centuries have passed since James Gillray's caricatures
savagely attacked the extravagance and promiscuous behaviour of the
'voluptuary', the then Prince of Wales. The crown survived. Nearly 60 years
have flown by since the abdication of Edward VIII was forced upon him when
he declared his intention of marrying Mrs Wallis Simpson, the American
divorcee. His niece is still on the throne.
There is no constitutional reason why the Queen's eldest son should not
succeed her. That he shall do so is, as it happens, the essence of the
British constitution. The Prince's qualification for the job is that he is
of his mother born. His private behaviour is irrelevant. This is not a
change of mind on my part. I have long advocated the setting up of a federal
republic of Britain, on the ground that the executive hides behind 'crown
prerogative' as an excuse for misgovernment. Hanging everything on the tag
of the supposed royal command is a licence to print honours, a permit for
the exercise of patronage.
Yet I would cheerfully salute the accession of Prince Charles if the throne
were first to become detached from the executive, made contractually
subservient to the people, and defined in a written constitution. It might
then usefully be slimmed down, becoming a 'bicycle monarchy' as in northern
Europe. It would certainly benefit from a period of reticence about itself,
as the Duke of Edinburgh intimated yesterday. In such clearly-defined
circumstances, the role of an hereditary king as a focus of loyalty to the
nation - that is, of all of us to one another - could as well be fulfilled
by Prince Charles as anyone. Better that, as they said at the recent Liberal
Democrat conference in Brighton, than President Tebbit or, heaven help us,
President Thatcher.
Meanwhile Queen Elizabeth II is more likely than not to reign well into the
next century. The first queen bearing her name ruled during a flowering of
English culture; hers were years of national glory. The second Elizabeth,
possessed of few powers, has been less fortunate. She has been able to
reign, but not rule. She has been steadfast and dutiful, but her governments
have not covered themselves in glory. They have left the nation uncertain
about whether it belongs to the continent to which it is attached.
As a nuclear power and permanent member of the security council, Britain
retains the vestiges of its 'great' past, but lacks the self-confidence to
participate wholeheartedly in the affairs of the European Union. We cling to
illusory 'certainties', such as 'sovereignty' and the idealised Victorian
royal family. We know that reality lies elsewhere. Some - perhaps most - of
us cannot bear the knowledge. To get through the night, we tune in to
'Charles and Di,' and go back to sleep.

<HEAD>Royal Baby Due Soon, Will Be Fifth In Line To British Throne</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York, wife of Prince Andrew, will
soon give birth to her first child following an active pregnancy
which survived two accidents, a family scandal and a flood of
rumors.
   Buckingham Palace insists the birth is due in mid-August, but
Britain already looks set for a fresh bout of royal baby hoopla,
spurred by excited predictions in the tabloid press that the big
day is imminent.
   The Sun newspaper said Friday the duchess' weight and other
health problems may force a Caesarian delivery this weekend.
   On July 22, the Star claimed the birth was likely to be
artificially induced within 48 hours because the duchess feared
losing the baby.
   Every other day, Andrew is prematurely reported to have left his
Royal Navy ship in Singapore to be at her side during the delivery.
   But Buckingham Palace is sticking to its forecast and refusing
to comment on the press reports.
   The baby, to carry the title Prince or Princess of York, will be
Queen Elizabeth II's fifth grandchild and fifth in line to succeed
her.
   ``Complications which could endanger mother and baby have led
her doctors to give up the wait for a natural delivery,'' the Sun
reported Friday.
   The newspaper said without attribution that the duchess' doctor
had decided on a Caesarian section because she is suffering from
high blood pressure and severe water retention, and because the
baby is in a breech position, meaning it would be born bottom first
rather than head first, as is normal.
   The Star added that the ``roly-poly'' duchess has gained almost
50 pounds during the pregnancy.
   The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, married
Andrew, the queen's second oldest son, in July 1986. When she
didn't become pregnant in the first year, the British media
speculated that ``Fergie'' was being treated for infertility,
although her family repeatedly denied it.
   The duchess radiated good health during the early months of her
pregnancy. She skiied in Europe, performed a full calendar of royal
engagements and worked at her publishing job until February. When
the palace confirmed her pregnancy on Jan. 25, the duchess was
taking a helicopter flying lesson.
   Then came two scares and a family scandal.
   The duchess fell into an icy stream while skiing in the French
Alps in March, when she was four months pregnant. Earlier this
month she escaped injury when her car, driven by a police
bodyguard, collided with another car on a busy highway outside
London.
   Meanwhile, the tabloids discovered that her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, was frequenting a London massage parlor. The scandal
almost got him expelled from his polo club.
   The duchess has broken with royal tradition in her choice of
doctor and hospital.
   Instead of Dr. George Pinker, royal gynecologist since 1973 and
deliverer of nine princes and princesses, she has chosen Dr.
Anthony Kenney, a prominent London obstetrician known to favor
natural childbirth.
   She has picked the private, American-owned Portland Hospital in
west London, unlike her sisters-in-law, Princess Diana and Princess
Anne, who had their babies in the private wing of a state-run
hospital.
   The modern Portland Hospital is said to be Britain's most
expensive maternity clinic.
   The Sun says Room 201 has been reserved for the duchess and
decorated with pink wallpaper and mauve floral curtains.
   Andrew was quoted as saying in May that the baby will be a girl
and will be named Annabelle. He refused a gift of a child's cricket
bat from a Yorkshire cricket team, saying: ``It won't be much use
... I'm sure we are having a girl.''
   However, the prince has a reputation as a prankster, and
Buckingham Palace said of his comments, ``It's all speculation.''
   Bookmakers William Hill say Annabelle remains the favorite name
for a girl and David for a boy.

<HEAD>Princess Diana Leaves NYC After Whirlwind Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although her visit to New York was brief,
Britain's Princess Diana seemed to capture the heart of the Big
Apple wherever she went.
   In three days, she saw an opera in Brooklyn, visited a fancy toy
store on Park Avenue and hugged a child with AIDS in a Harlem
hospital.
   The Princess of Wales rubbed elbows with developer Donald Trump,
publisher Malcolm Forbes and actor Michael Douglas.
   Diana also touched the heart of 13-year-old Hope Manley, a
Pennsylvania youngster suffering from cystic fibrosis, and Wanda
Morales, whom the princess visited in a lower East Side shelter for
the homeless.
   On Friday, the last day of her visit, she toured the pediatrics
ward of Harlem Hospital where Diana unexpectedly picked up a
7-year-old afflicted with AIDS after first asking him, ``Are you
heavy?''
   The 27-year-old princess has long sought to educate the public
about the disease, which doctors say cannot be transmitted through
casual contact.
   The princess also attended a briefing by the hospital's
pediatrics director, Dr. Margaret Heagarty, who said later that
Diana was genuinely concerned about the plight of the children and
occasionally interrupted to ask questions.
   At the hospital, hundreds of excited workers strained to catch a
glimpse of the princess. It had been the same throughout her visit
as usually nonplussed New Yorkers sometimes breathlessly recounted a
royal handshake or a wave.
   After her visit to the hospital, Diana attended a private
reception given by British Consul General Gordon Jewkes for about 60
patrons of the Royal Academy of Music.
   After that she left New York as she had arrived, aboard a British
Airways supersonic Concorde.
   Friday's events capped a visit that also included a visit to a
homeless shelter and day-care center and the American debut
performance by the Welsh National Opera at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music.
   Cheering crowds greeted the princess at nearly every stop. The
exception was when about 400 protestors showed up in Brooklyn to
denounce Britain's policies in Northern Ireland.
   But inside the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Diana dazzled the
audience as she entered to a drumroll and the opera patrons fell
silent.
   And later that same evening, New York's social elite again fell
silent as the princess walked down a marble staircase to the dining
area of a gala reception in her honor at the World Financial Center.
   The 800 or so guests remained silent until she approached her
seat at the head table, when they broke into spontaneous applause.
   Her husband, Prince Charles, who stayed in Britian this week,
will arrive in the United States on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit to
Washington and Palm Beach, Fla., where he'll attend charity polo
matches.
