   Luck Is Running Out at Some Lotteries,
   As Competition and Boredom Take Toll

   Lotteries for years have pushed dreams of easy millions,
both for bettors and the states that sell tickets to
potential fame and fortune. But, like more pedestrian
businesses, state lotteries are beginning to feel the effects
of increased competition and plain old customer boredom.
   Since lotteries were introduced in the mid-1960s, states
have distilled the public's lust for instant riches into a
bonanza for cash-strapped coffers. Lottomania has swept 33
states and the District of Columbia, pumping more than $7
billion into education, senior citizens' programs and other
causes last year alone. Estimated 1990 sales rose to a record
$20 billion, although the approximate 6% increase was the
smallest since 1987 and resulted largely from new states
starting games.

   While new lotteries usually enjoy robust double-digit
growth for a while, the real trick is producing steady growth
once the novelty wears off. "There are people who think
lotteries are in a world by themselves, but they're not
immune to the laws of the marketplace," says Saul F. Leonard,
a gambling industry consultant in Los Angeles who works with
state lotteries. And lottery officials, who are looking for
new games and technologies that can produce solid long-term
growth, warn that there aren't any quick fixes.
   In the short term, many lottery officials say the
recession is chipping away at customers' discretionary
spending, debunking the old myth that gambling is
recessionproof. While executives say it's difficult to know
just how damaging the recession will be, it's clearly
affecting lottery sales in New York and a number of other
states.
   Although lotteries are a form of gambling, they compete
directly with movies, video rentals and other discretionary
purchases for the consumer's entertainment dollar. The
expansion of riverboat gambling, Indian bingo, off-track
betting and other forms of gambling may also hurt.
   "Lottery growth is continuing, but in many cases it's not
meeting expectations," says William S. Bergman, executive
director of the North American Association of State and
Provincial Lotteries. While new lotteries are continuing to
do well, he says, "for the more mature lotteries, especially
those in the Northeast and the Rust Belt, things are
softening a bit."
   Total sales in California dropped to $2.47 billion in the
year ended June 30 from $2.62 billion the prior year,
although lottery officials say the decline has leveled off
since last summer. Iowa's sales dropped about 2% to $169.5
million last year, while such other states as Pennsylvania
have also shown declines in the past year.
   In several states, lotto game sales are declining, but the
drop is being offset somewhat by increases in other games.
Peter D. Lynch, director of the New York lottery, thinks
higher gasoline prices are a prime suspect in the sharp
falloff of state lotto sales since last summer. "Someone who
spent $15 to fill up the gasoline tank and $5 in lottery
tickets is now spending $22 to fill up the tank," Mr. Lynch
says. Lotto sales have dropped 8% since last summer, he
estimates.
   The problems affecting the New York lottery, long
considered one of the nation's most successful, are typical
of those bedeviling mature lotteries. Tight-fisted state
officials slashed the lottery's ad budget 40% this fiscal
year. A special promotion in January produced a spectacular
$90 million jackpot, and officials hoped it would pump up
sales by grabbing big headlines. But hardly a word appeared
in the press because of coverage of the war. Nonetheless, Mr.
Lynch expects sales to hit $2.1 billion this year, up from
$1.92 billion in the year ended March 31.
   Bigger jackpots alone no longer guarantee player interest,
experts say. And serious gamblers have always argued that
lotteries are a lousy bet: The odds of picking the correct
six of 53 numbers, for example, are a staggering 23 million
to one. Many lotteries operate under guidelines similar to
those governing California's lottery, which allocates at
least 34% of sales to public schools, 50% to players and a
maximum of 16% to retailer commissions and other expenses.
   Given those odds, many lotteries are shifting their
pitches from "become an instant millionaire" to the fun of
playing. "We stress winning too much," says Jim Davey,
director of the Oregon lottery and president of Lotto
America, a lottery game that is played in several smaller
states. "We haven't done a good job in positioning it as
entertainment."
   The Oregon lottery was a pioneer in a new generation of
lottery games when it started the nation's first sports pool
games last year. The games fell short of expectations, and
faced formidable opposition from the National Football League
and the National Basketball Association, which are fighting
in Congress and individual states to block lottery sports
betting.
   Many experts believe sports games could help lottery
growth, but most say new technologies hold greater promise.
South Dakota is among the first to try video lottery
terminals, which offer instant results and have proved
popular with players. But many lottery directors worry about
a public outcry over video terminals, which some might think
blur the line between traditional lotto and "hard" gambling.
   The format that may hold the greatest potential -- and
faces the biggest hurdles -- is an interactive telephone
lottery. A group of lottery directors is exploring a
multi-state lottery that would let players gain access to the
game from their telephones. A television show tie-in would
provide the excitement and "player engagement" that makes
casino gambling so popular.
   "Phone interactive is one of a very, very few remaining
big-time events for lotteries," says Sharon Sharp, director
of the $1.6 billion Illinois lottery and a leading proponent
of the game. Mrs. Sharp acknowledges that political
opposition could be formidable but notes that lotteries are
by their nature controversial.
   Chon Gutierrez, who oversees the nation's biggest lottery
in California, believes the key to growth isn't in new games
but in making lotteries more accessible to players. "The key
to the future of the lottery is in broadening the player
base," Mr. Gutierrez says. "We have to minimize the hurdles
that force the occasional player to go out of his way to
play."
   Despite the slowdown in lottery growth, the games seem
certain to spread. Resistance to lotteries has succumbed to a
need for revenue even in such conservative states as
Louisiana, and experts bet that other Bible Belt states and
Texas won't be far behind. "When their financial situation
becomes stressful enough, you'll see gambling come through,"
says Mr. Leonard.
   In fact, lottery officials say, some cities are looking at
lotteries as a possible way of stemming their own flood of
red ink, either by tapping into their state's lottery or
starting up a separate municipal game, a move likely to meet
heated opposition from state games. New York City considered
a 25-cent surcharge on ticket sales and even wanted to start
its own scratchoff lottery game, but the Legislature didn't
approve them. Industry experts say the issues are bound to
recur as fiscal crises deepen around the nation.
   As lotteries enter their next phase, some worry that
states may seek a higher payoff for themselves. "Expectations
are so high," says Illinois's Mrs. Sharp. "But if we see
states get too greedy for lottery dollars, it can hurt."
Increasingly, lotteries find themselves stuck in the
political crossfire among legislatures, constituents and
state leaders as they search for cash cows to supplement
shrinking tax bases.
   Mr. Lynch of the New York lottery says the current
slowdown in lottery growth proves clearly that "there's a
limit to the public's discretionary spending on all forms of
entertainment, and lotteries in particular." But considering
the huge "gray market" for such activities as video poker
machines, he adds, "there's still plenty of room for
lotteries to grow without reaching a saturation point."

<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania Lottery said Wednesday
it has decided to stick with its computer vendor, Control Data
Corp. of Minneapolis, in a new five-year, $143 million contract.
   Companies from Rhode Island, Maryland and Georgia were
unsuccessful in their bid for the contract with the lottery, the
nation's third largest. The Pennsylvania Lottery had gross revenue
of of $1.3 billion in 1986-87 and profits of $570 million.
   Control Data's Automated Wagering Division, based in New York
City, will supply a minimum of 3,200 new sales terminals and a
primary and backup computer with new telecommunications features,
said Revenue Secretary Barton Fields. The new equipment is to be
installed by next January.
   After a three-month review, lottery officials decided Control
Data's 11 years' experience as the lottery's computer supplier and
its proposed system were among the reasons to keep the company,
Fields said.
   ``CDC, by virtue of its state-of-the-art technology and
expertise, is the supplier best suited to serve the lottery into
the 1990s,'' Fields said in a statement.
   Other vendors who had submitted proposals were G-Tech Corp. of
Warwick, R.I., General Instruments Corp. of Hunt Valley, Md. and
Scientific Games of Atlanta.
   The new contract will take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and the $143
million is the estimated worth over five years.
   ``The Pennsylvania Lottery system will be the newest and most
powerful lottery system available to the lottery industry today,''
said James Chidester, vice president of wagering services for the
Automated Wagering Division.
   Control Data, with over 50 percent of the market for on-line
lottery equipment, supplies lotteries in five states besides
Pennsylvania and recently was awarded the contract for Florida's
new lottery, the company said. The other states with Control Data
equipment are Maryland, Delaware, New York, Illinois and Washington.

<HEAD>Connecticut Revives Lottery System After 24-Hour Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut's million-dollar-a-day
lottery was revived late Wednesday after a 24-hour shutdown
following the discovery that tickets could be bought after the
winning numbers were announced.
   The company that provided new computers for the lottery
``assured us the problems have been fixed,'' said Gregory Zieman,
assistant chief of the lottery unit of the Division of Special
Revenue.
   Lottery officials said parts of the 2,200-terminal system were
operating at 7:30 p.m. but did not know how long it would take to
get all 2,200 terminals back on line.
   The new equipment went on line Sunday. The games were suspended
Tuesday evening.
   The flaw in the system was demonstrated by two Hartford ticket
agents who saw Monday's televised drawing then played the winning
numbers, officials said. The machines gave them tickets with
numbers dated Monday instead of Tuesday.
   The pair, Jose Rodriguez and Gilberto Pardo, startled lottery
officials Tuesday when they revealed what had happened and handed
back $16,500 in checks that had just been made out in their names.
   Lottery unit spokeswoman Ann Evans said she did not know whether
there were any other such incidents. Officials say codes of winning
tickets can be checked if a problem is suspected.
   The state operates daily lottery and Play Four games and
twice-weekly Lotto games with drawings on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Tuesday's drawings were held and winners' tickets will be honored
when the system resumes operating, said J. Blaine Lewis Jr., chief
of the Special Revenue lottery unit.
   The state sells $8 million in tickets a week and has a net
weekly profit of $3 million, Lewis said.
   The mixup compounded the headaches of the Division of Special
Revenue, which was forced to shut down two jai alai frontons
because of strike by players. The state gets $55,000 a day from jai
alai wagering, officials say.
   Earlier Wednesday, some lottery agents reported unhappy
customers.
   ``They're very angry about it,'' said Richard Shoztic, manager
of Bull's Head News and Variety in Stamford.
   ``They think the store owners have something to do with it and
don't realize it's someone else's problem,'' Shoztic said. ``A few
have said they would play in New York.''
   Lewis said the contract with the company that runs the lottery
system, General Instrument Co. of Hunt Valley, Md., stipulates that
the company will be penalized when the system is down for the
amount of the state's lost profits.
   General Instrument took over the system from G-Tech Corp. of
Providence, R.I., when it was awarded a five-year, $40 million
contract in December. General Instrument's bid was $11 million
lower than G-Tech's, according to Lewis.
   General Instrument also runs the Off-Track Betting computer and
ran the state's lottery system when it was begun in the early
1970s, he said.
   General Instrument officials did not immediately return calls
placed to their Wethersfield office.
   The company also provides equipment for the 1,200-terminal
Missouri lottery. Officials there said they experienced problems
when the system went on line in 1986 but did not have to shut it
down.

<TEXT>
   A computer failure that cost the state up to
$700,000 in lost lottery ticket sales is being investigated by
specialists from the firm that set up the troubled ``Lotto 6-49''
terminals, officials said.
   Experts from GTECH, based in Providence, R.I., were to inspect
the software that caused the 3-year-old lottery's worst computer
breakdown.
   The computer crash came as the state was ending an investigation
of problems with GTECH, which has been fined $1.7 million for
computer mishaps since the company got the ``Lotto 6-49'' contract
in October 1986. A report of the investigation is due Friday, said
lottery director Chon Gutierrez.
   The computer failure Saturday night affected up to 4,700 of the
state lottery's 7,200 ``Lotto 6-49'' terminals.
   A backup system restored service to all but 120 terminals about
12 minutes later, lottery spokeswoman Susan Kossack said. ``What is
unusual is that all of the terminals on the backup system did not
come back up,'' she said.
   In spite of the outage, three players picked all six numbers
correctly to win $2 million each.
   GTECH, which operates Lotto under a $220 million five-year
contract with the state, is subject to fines for each minute of
computer lapse that occurs up to eight hours before the Wednesday
and Saturday drawings.
   GTECH faces a fine of ``close to $200,000'' as a result of the
failure, lottery computer director Joanne Hoffman told the Los
Angeles Times.
   However, Leonard G. Morrissey, GTECH's senior vice president,
told the Rocky Mountain News in Denver that his company probably
would have to pay less than $1,000 in fines for Saturday's
breakdown. GTECH is installing the system for Colorado's lottery,
which is scheduled to begin Jan. 24.
   In a related development, the San Francisco Chronicle and the
Times reported Tuesday that GTECH has been investigated by auditors
from the lottery and the state controller's office.
   The two-month investigation was prompted by allegations from two
lottery telecommunications systems analysts who contended that GTECH
concealed computer malfunctions to avoid paying the state damages
for lost Lotto revenue.
   Lew Ritter, chief of security for the state lottery, called the
allegations ``just a bunch of baloney.'' He predicted that GTECH
will be cleared of wrongdoing.
   Cynthia Nebergall, GTECH's general counsel, declined to discuss
the allegations, citing company policy.
   The two complaining workers, who have been transferred from their
jobs pending the investigation, allege that lottery officials are
covering up for GTECH.

   Florida's Lotto jackpot reached $100
million Thursday with tickets for Saturday's drawing selling at a
rate of 500 a second.
   Players poured in from other states and countries with dreams of
becoming millionaires, or of making a few bucks selling the $1
tickets at a higher price to those who could not make it to
Florida. The tickets are not sold outside the state.
   Two men from New Orleans, Joe Revolta and Robert Bache, plunked
down $10,000 in cash Wednesday for 10,000 tickets at Groovin'
Noovin's, a Pensacola convenience store near the Alabama-Florida
state line.
   ``It's on our news in Louisiana constantly,'' Revolta said.
``You might not have much of a chance, but you have even less if
you don't play.''
   State lottery officials on Thursday increased the jackpot to
$100 million, the second largest in U.S. history, but said they
doubted it would break the record of $115 million. The expected
jackpot is based on sales and projected sales through Saturday.
   About 30 people flew from Atlanta to Pensacola Regional Airport
early Wednesday, bought tickets at a nearby convenience store and
went home, said Gene Mumtzis of Eagle Travel.
   ``One guy said he goes to California, Ohio and everywhere else
to buy tickets,'' Mumtzis said.
   Richard Cardone, owner of a Pittsburgh beauty salon, bought 50
tickets during an airline stopover in West Palm Beach.
   ``Who wouldn't play?'' asked Cardone. ``You'd be a fool not to.
Everybody's fantasy is to be a multimillionaire.''
   Bahamians carrying thousands of dollars are flying to south
Florida to buy tickets tosell at a higher price back home, the
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported.
   ``They come every Friday. This week they will bring $4,000 to
$5,000,'' said George Prado, who sells lottery tickets at the
Caribe Cafeteria, a Cuban restaurant near Miami International
Airport.
   To play the Florida Lotto game, players select six numbers from
one to 49. The winning numbers are chosen at random during a
weekly, televised drawing.
   The odds of one ticket containing all six winning numbers are
about one-in-14 million. But for every dollar spent, there was a
dream.
   ``First, I would help the church in any way I could, then I
would buy a ticket to fly to the moon,'' said Anne Straub, 66, of
Gulf Breeze. ``I've just always wanted to go into space.''
   On Thursday, tickets sold at a rate of 500 a second, said
Florida Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The highest sales were reported along the state's lines with
Georgia and Alabama, she said.
   Results of Saturday night's drawing would be announced Sunday,
although the final size of the jackpot would not be determined
until Monday, she said.
   The record jackpot of $115 million was split among 14 winning
tickets in Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was a $58 million jackpot
split between five winners in April. Each winning ticket was worth
nearly $11.7 million, to be paid out over 20 years.
   Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs holds the world record for a
prize to a single winner of a computerized numbers game. She won a
$55.1 million Florida Lotto jackpot in September 1988.
   In Florida, 50 percent of each dollar spent on the lottery is
returned in prizes, 38 percent goes to the state's schools system
and the rest is split between retailers and the lottery department.

   As six states and the District of Columbia
launch a new multistate Lotto game, Associated Press bureaus in 26
states checked on their states' experience with legal wagering.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-six states are now wheedling extra dollars from their
taxpayers with lottery games, helping senior citizens in
Pennsylvania, schools in Ohio and economic development in Iowa and
Oregon.
   Total sales exceeded $12 billion last year. Eight states sell $1
billion or more in lottery tickets a year, keeping a third or more
of that amount to support state programs. Within the last year,
Florida, Kansas, Montana and South Dakota have joined the club, and
Wisconsin and Virginia will begin games this year.
   Though most states report rising income from wagering, some have
to hustle to keep bettors interested.
   Last week, Pennsylvania scrapped a lotto game that had sold $2.2
billion worth of tickets since 1982 and launched a ``Wild Card
Lotto'' game. Players in the old game picked six numbers out of 40,
but the new game has 48 choices.
   That changes the odds of winning from one in 1.9 million to one
in 6.1 million. That, in turn, increases the chances of creating
one of those humongous $30 million or $40 million jackpots that
inspire frantic ticket sales.
   ``We've had so many people who've won a million or more, it now
takes a pot of $10 million to generate the interest that $5 million
did once,'' says Laurie Kipp-Klecha, a spokeswoman for the lottery
in Michigan, where on Sunday officials said someone was holding a
$17 million ticket after the latest drawing.
   ``People like to spend a dollar to have a shot at the moon,''
said Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   That's also the theory behind the new six-state ``Lotto
America'' game, launched last week in Oregon, Iowa, Kansas,
Missouri, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
With more bettors to lose money, the game can offer bigger prizes _
a minimum of $2 million.
   ``Our motivation is to offer Oregonians a chance to play in
games they could play in one of the big states,'' said James Davey,
whose state lottery faces big-jackpot competition along the
California border.
   No one picked all seven numbers to win the jackpot in the first
Lotto America drawing held Saturday night. More than 2 million
tickets were sold, spokesman Brett Voorhees said in Des Moines,
Iowa.
   Colorado legislators, who have seen lottery sales slump from
$136.9 million in the first year, 1982-83, to as low as $105.3
million in fiscal 1985, are debating a big-jackpot lotto game this
year.
   Donald L. Bean, assistant director of the Ohio lottery, credits
the state's ``Super Lotto'' game with helping build ticket sales
from $100 million in the first year, 1974-75, to $1.07 billion last
year.
   There are seven other states in the billion-dollar club:
California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania.
   New York has the most lucrative games, earning $666.8 million on
sales of $1.46 billion, a 45 percent profit, in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1987.
   New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania all extract more than 40
percent from their games as well.
   However, Missouri's 2-year-old lottery has run into problems
because the state constitutional amendment authorizing the games
requires that 45 percent of the proceeds go to the state and that
no more than 10 percent go to administration.
   An independent audit commissioned by the Legislature concluded
that the game would fail early in 1989 unless more money was
offered as prizes and more money was available for administration.
An amendment reflecting those recommendations will be on the
Missouri ballot later this year.
   The Missouri lottery earned $80 million last year, far less than
the $250 million a year some legislators had forecast.
   Even a successful operation such as the New York lottery
contributes only 2.5 percent of the state's general fund budget,
and there is no reason to believe that lotteries have been a
substitute for tax increases.
   New York's game began at the same time sales, personal income
and corporate taxes were rising in the free-spending years of Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller. Washington state's lottery came with a package
of tax increases in 1982, when the state was hard-pressed for cash.
   Dave Ellis, spokesman for the Massachusetts lottery, recalled
that the lottery was promoted in 1971 as a way of avoiding a sales
tax increase from 3 percent to 4 percent. In 1975, the sales tax
went up to 5 percent _ part of a program by newly elected Gov.
Michael Dukakis to eliminate a $600 million deficit.
   Pennsylvania's receipts are earmarked for senior citizen
programs such as tax subsidies and prescription drugs. Despite
projected growth of 11 percent next year, revenues were lagging
behind program requirements, and Gov. Robert P. Casey has
recommended returning some of the senior citizen programs to
general funding.
   Iowa decided not to depend on lottery profits for state
operations. Instead, ``Iowa Plan'' proceeds go into one-time
economic development programs such as grants to new or expanding
businesses.
   Oregon also directs its lottery profits _ $47.3 million last
year _ to economic development.
   Florida, which began its lottery last month, has a novel clause
making things more difficult for unscrupulous prize winners. It
provides for prizes to be awarded to dependents if the winner is a
child-support deadbeat. Already, $70,000 has been earmarked for
dependents.

<TEXT>     In Texas, hoping to become millionaires and avoid new taxes, would-be
gamblers overwhelmingly voted Nov. 5 to end the 146-year-old ban against
state-run lotteries.;   Looming even larger on the lottery horizon are
so-called video lottery machines -- kissing cousins to slot machines.;   And
on the drawing boards are ticket purchases with credit cards, games that can
be played on home computers via telephone modems, and a national lottery
television show in which home viewers can participate.;   "You see experiments
now that you wouldn't have seen a few years ago," said William Bergman,
director of the National Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.;   The
reason: Lotteries have experienced a major slide in growth since 1988, either
because the novelty has worn off, because there's new competition from other
wagering games or because of the recession's drain on personal finances.;
NINE STATES, including California, have reported declines in sales, according
to Christensen Cummings Associates of New York, which tracks the industry's
sales. Illinois, which is considering the use of 900 numbers, has stayed level
at $1.5 billion a year.;   But all 34 U.S. lotteries are reaching for new ways
to win customers. Whipping them on are deficit-ridden state governments that
have come to expect more of the $57 billion cash feed that lotteries have
given them over 17 years, the one tax that no one has to pay.;   Those
lotteries that aren't looking to technological innovations and gambling
industry clone games for their salvation are rethinking the size of their
prizes and the odds of winning them.;   The 16-state Lotto America, whose
sales have plunged as much as 60 percent in some weeks during the past six
months, is considering raising the odds so that million-dollar jackpots will
build to more exciting amounts. Lotto America also may triple its number of
lower-tier prizes.;   "There's a growing feeling that the decline is caused by
lack of winner reinforcement," said George Andersen, director of Minnesota's
lottery and a Lotto America board member. "If you don't win something, you
tend not to play, and it takes a larger and larger number to get you active.";
  There is no shortage of novel ideas to reinvigorate lotteries.;   In Oregon,
where ticket buyers can bet on sports games, they now may play a new keno game
every five minutes, with results shown on a television monitor at ticket
purchase sites.;   And Minnesota lottery officials had hoped to launch a pilot
project that would have let people buy lottery tickets through Nintendo units
in their homes.;    NINTENDO DECKS, estimated to be in 32 percent of Minnesota
homes, would have been equipped with special lottery cartridges and a
telephone modem. But the idea was abandoned after vocal protests from several
powerful state legislators.;   By far the most alluring and controversial new
growth area is the video lottery or poker blackjack machine, similar to those
that account for as much as 70 percent of income in some Las Vegas casinos.;
The machines, already in use in South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia, are
set to be introduced next year in Oregon and Louisiana. As many as 23 states
are considering video lottery games.;   In South Dakota, where the machines
have been in bars, taverns and restaurants since late 1989, gross sales were
$25.5 million last year -- six times greater than for the state's instant
lottery.;   "The big game is video lottery. That towers over all the others in
the country," said Jim Davey, who hopes the machines will add $50 million a
year to his $200-million-a-year Oregon state lottery.;   But the machines have
not been met with open arms in many state legislatures. Some lawmakers in
Oregon and other states question the authority of lottery officials to
introduce video lottery machines.;   "There is a sense that it is bad public
policy and not within the mandate of the lottery, or the character of the
state," said Fred McGibney, director of the Vermont lottery commission, which
rejected video lottery games last year.;   But competitive pressures may
change such attitudes. Just as the Illinois lottery created the desire for
lotteries in neighboring Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana and Missouri, a similar
effect is being generated by South Dakota's video lottery machines.;
"Lotteries are moving toward harder forms of gambling to deflect criticism
from their stagnant sales, and states are looking toward harder forms of
gambling, envisioning that they will generate the revenues that lotteries
did," said Michael Jones, whose Chicago-based marketing promotion company
specializes in gaming.;   AMERICANS spent $10 billion on lottery tickets last
year -- twice as much as they did on movie theater tickets, according to
Christensen Cummings Associates.;   Despite their incredibly bad odds, lottery
tickets remain "a vent, a palliative . . . popular during times when people
aren't socially optimistic," said Mark Pastin, director of the Lincoln Center
for Ethics at Arizona State University. "It's still a kind of hope anybody can
buy for a few bucks."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Ticket Sales Brisk For World-Record $52 Million Lotto</HEAD>

   Lottery machines spewed out tickets by
the millions Friday as players scurried for a chance to win
Saturday's world-record $52 million Lotto jackpot.
   Tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second, said Ed
George, spokesman for the Florida lottery.
   For the day, 7.5 million tickets at $1 apiece had been sold by 5
p.m., compared to 4.9 million at the same time last Friday when the
jackpot was $32 million. The jackpot has been climbing because no
one has won since Aug. 6.
   Fridays are the lottery's second-biggest sales day. A full 50
percent of any week's sales are made on Saturdays through 10:30
p.m. when computerized ticket machines shut down for the 11 p.m.
drawings.
   Last week some 32 million tickets were sold. This week,
officials expected sales to hit 40 million.
   It took Florida only four months to break the world record for a
Lotto prize, which California set in June with a $51.4 million
prize that was shared by two winners. Florida launched its Lotto
game in April.
   In spite of the 14-million-to-one odds, the record-jackpot was
attracting players from bordering states in large numbers, lottery
officials said.
   Eight of the state's top 10 retailers, measured by ticket sales,
are located in Panhandle or northeast Florida counties bordering
Alabama and Georgia, neither of which has a legalized lottery, said
George.
   ``We do know that our border retailers are very heavy,'' said
George. ``Any one of those retailers will tell you what the tags
are on the cars in the parking lots.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But because Postal Service regulations prohibit the sale
of the lottery tickets through the mail, people must visit Florida
to buy their tickets or have someone buy them.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' said Bill McMurtray, manager of a convenience store and
service station in Bradfordville, about eight miles south of the
Georgia border.
   Lotto players select six numbers from one through 49, mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   The $51.4 million California prize had been the world record,
according to Terri La Fleur, a senior editor at Gaming and Wagering
Business Magazine, a monthly trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur. Spain's ``El Gordo''
lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but it was not a Lotto-style
jackpot.

<HL> Will Lotteries Win the Heart Of the South? </HL>

<TEXT>
   It's an old story in the gambling industry.
States where lotteries are legal invariably sell a big share of their tickets to -- and earn a major chunk of their profits from -- people who live in neighboring states where lotteries aren't allowed.

   After watching revenue dribble away to state governments next door, the lottery-free states usually come to rethink their position and start games of their own.

   This ripple effect is worth contemplating as state-sponsored games of chance begin to test the waters in the South, the last basically lottery-free region of the U.S.
Two states, both on the South's periphery, have recently approved lotteries.
Florida's lotto game, just four months old, has already run up the biggest single jackpot -- $55.2 million -- of any state lottery.
Virginia plans to begin selling lottery tickets today.

   Gaming officials and state legislators now wonder whether these lotteries will begin to erode the longstanding aversion to wagering in the core of the Bible Belt -- or whether they'll merely fuel the opposition.

   "This is an issue that would bring the church leaders out of the woodwork, and there's not many legislators that could stand that heat," says Barbara Morgan, press secretary to Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris.
The governor has pledged to veto any lottery bill in his state.

   In Texas, the most populous state without a lottery, a huge state-government budget deficit had lottery supporters hopeful for a while, as lotteries have proved to be potent revenue raisers.
Illinois, for example, reaped $543 million from lottery sales in the fiscal year ended June 30.

   But Texas lawmakers, who narrowly approved parimutuel betting for horse and dog tracks, have defeated a lottery bill in the past two sessions.
The state constitution bars lotteries, and changing that requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature.

   Richard Brown, an Austin-based lobbyist who favors lotteries, thinks the racetrack backers will now join the powerful Baptist Church lobby in opposing a lottery.
"Unless there's extensive preparatory work by the (lottery) advocates, chances in the next session are bleak indeed," he says.

   Florida, meanwhile, is gladly taking the money of thousands of lottery-happy Georgians and Alabamans.
Eight of Florida's 10 top ticket sellers -- including the three biggest -- are small retailers located near the state's northern border.

   Rebecca Paul, Florida's lottery director, expects Georgia and Alabama will start lotteries.
"But," she adds, "I don't think it will happen for five years."

   Michael Jones, former Illinois lottery director and now a Chicago-based lottery consultant, believes most states will join in eventually.
He notes that Illinois started its lotto game in 1983.
Two years later, Missouri capitulated after state officials figured out that St. Louis residents were crossing the Mississippi River and buying $80 million to $100 million of Illinois lottery tickets annually.
Kansas began its lottery a year later after watching its citizens playing the new Missouri game.

   In 1964, New Hampshire was the only state with a lottery.
Since then, 27 states have followed suit.
Every state in New England, in the industrial Northeast and along the Pacific Coast has a lottery.

   The Sun Belt east of Arizona (excepting Florida) is conspicuously lottery free.
So is Utah, dominated by the Mormon Church, as well as Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada.

   The Florida lottery's first
computerized numbers game produced 859 winners Friday night, and
that didn't include the St. Petersburg Times, which published a
photo of a winning ticket hours before the contest.
   A photograph at the top of the front page of Friday morning's
paper showed the numbers 8-0-6, which proved to be the winning
combination in the first Cash 3 contest. The photo showed a sample
ticket sent to the paper a month ago.
   ``This was entirely coincidental,'' City Editor Jack Reed said.
``It doesn't seem like that should need to be said, but we've
gotten so many calls.''
   The Cash 3 winners will split a total payout of $94,090.
   Sales of the Lotto and Cash 3 tickets began when Lt. Gov. Bobby
Brantley purchased two Cash 3 betting slips.
   But the kickoff was delayed several minutes when a computer
terminal at the new lottery headquarters refused to issue
Brantley's tickets because the terminal's password had not been
entered correctly.
   Across the state, 3,142 retailers were supposed to be hooked
into a central computer to begin dispensing the 50-cent Cash 3 and
$1 Lotto tickets.
   Several reported their machines were not working or said they
could not get through on a hotline set up by Control Data Corp.,
which is operating the on-line computer system.
   By 7:30 p.m., $616,543 had been wagered on Cash 3 and $345,377
on the Lotto game.
   ``Most on-line games start out slow and then grow,'' lottery
Secretary Rebecca Paul said. She predicted combined Lotto and Cash
3 sales would surpass $10 million in the first eight days of sales,
and $1 billion in the first year.
   Thirty-five percent of all lottery revenue is earmarked for
public education.
   Twenty-eight states, including Florida, and the District of
Columbia have legalized lotteries. Law enforcement officials hope
the Florida games will help undermine illegal numbers rackets.
   ``Some of the people down here have been playing illegal numbers
since they were teen-agers,'' said Lt. Norflett Harris of the Miami
Police vice squad. ``But if they can find a way to play the same
amount, win the same amount and do it legally, I'm reasonably sure
a lot of them will switch over and play the legal game or start
playing both.''
   Cash 3 offers daily top prizes of $500. Players pick numbers
from 000 to 999.
   In the Lotto game, players pick six numbers from 1 to 49. The
first winning number will be drawn May 7 when the jackpot will be
at least $2 million, but could reach $4 million.

   Florida's Lotto jackpot increased
Wednesday to a world's record $52 million as ticket sales continued
booming.
   Sales for this week's prize were up 36 percent over Wednesday
afternoon sales last week, so officials increased the prize from
$50 million to $52 million, said Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   ``Our sales are going into orbit,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   California gave away $51.4 million in June, 21 months after
starting its computerized numbers game. Florida's Lotto began four
months ago.
   ``We have experienced unprecedented growth for a lottery state
this young,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   The $52 million jackpot is a world record, according to Terri La
Fleur, a senior editor with Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine,
a monthly trade publication based in New York City.
   The jackpot includes three weekly grand prizes, because no one
has correctly guessed the six winning numbers drawn each Saturday
night since Aug. 6. Last week's jackpot had grown to $32 million.
   Lottery officials are assuming that at least 40 million tickets
will be sold this week, to support the increase of the prize to $52
million.
   Some 32 million $1 tickets were sold last week, Mrs. Paul said.
   This week's sales of 7.8 million tickets by Wednesday afternoon
were up 36 percent over last week's sales, Mrs. Paul said. The bulk
of the sales are usually at the end of the week.
   ``The $50 million jackpot has really brought a lot of people
in,'' said Gary Harper, assistant manager of a Jiffy Store that
sell lottery tickets in Ponte Vedra Beach. ``Saturday is going to
be our big day.''

<HEAD>GTECH Goes After Lottery Market In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTECH Corp., the world's leading maker
of computerized lottery systems, has its eyes set on the world's
biggest market: China.
   The company is negotiating a contract to set up ticket-printing
plants in China, a deal that executives hope eventually leads to
the installation of an on-line lottery network similar to those
used in the United States.
   The winner of the contract to print tickets for China's handful
of paper lottery games could have the inside track on any future
projects, said Guy B. Snowden, GTECH chairman.
   ``One thing that I've found out about Asian philosophy and
Chinese culture in particular is that if you get going with them,
the relationships tend to be very long term,'' Snowden said.
   Iit has been known since last fall, when Chinese representatives
attended a lottery industry exposition, that the nation was
interested in a more sophisticated lottery.
   Lottery company executives say China's 1 billion population and
its increasingly consumerized society make it a tempting target.
   About a year ago, China introduced lotteries in a handful of
provinces. Buses drive to villages and sell tickets from a window _
tickets that GTECH hopes to win the contract to print.
   A computerized on-line lottery system like those in use in the
United States could follow, Snowden said. ``We want to provide them
an electronic bus,'' he said.
   China is the largest, but not the only, country where GTECH and
other lottery-system makers are seeking to expand.
   Lottery company executives estimate the world could easily
support 250,000 wagering terminals, yet only 60,000 have been
installed. In the United States, by contrast, the competition for
lottery contracts has dwindled; fewer states are starting lotteries
and most that already have them are under long-term contracts.
   GTECH reportedly is close to contracts in South Korea, Turkey,
Taiwan and West Germany, and runs on-line lotteries in Australia,
Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Singapore,
Sweden and Venezuela, as well as in 10 American states.

   No one won Florida's $32 million Lotto
jackpot, pushing the grand prize in the weekly numbers game to at
least $50 million, only $1.4 million short of the nation's record
lottery prize.
   Lottery officials estimate each week's jackpot based on
projected sales.
   But Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Sunday she didn't know
if ticket sales would surpass expectations this week and push the
jackpot past the national record. ``We don't know what's going to
happen,'' she said.
   The size of the prize should give Florida's lottery national
exposure that will help attract tourists to the months-old game,
Mrs. Paul said.
   ``That is really, really good for the state of Florida,'' she
said.
   The national record for a lottery prize was set in June when
California gave away $51.4 million to two winners.
   In the Florida Lotto game, players try to match six numbers from
one through 49. Tickets are $1.
   No one matched the six winning numbers drawn Saturday _ 20, 42,
6, 29, 45 and 26.
   The prizes are rolled over into the next week's purse, fueling
sales as they get bigger. The Florida jackpot increases quickly,
compared with other states, partly because the state set up its
lottery with some of the toughest odds of any lottery in the nation
_ nearly 14 million to 1 against winning.
   Florida joined 27 states and the District of Columbia that have
legalized lotteries when the Lotto game started in April.
   Three drawings have now passed without a grand prize winner.
Emily Davidheiser of Brandon claimed the $26 million prize from the
Aug. 6 drawing.
   More than 32 million Lotto tickets were sold this last week,
according to Mrs. Paul.

   A world-record lottery jackpot drew
entrants from as far away as England as 265 tickets a second were
sold for a shot at the $52 million Florida Lotto drawing tonight.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' Bill McMurtray, manager of the Sing convenience store and
gas station in Bradfordville near the Georgia line, said Friday.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said she met a man from London
who read about the jackpot and flew to Florida to play.
   The record prize in the 4-month-old lottery also is attracting
droves of players from neighboring states.
   Eight of the state's top 10 ticket sellers are in the Panhandle
or northeast Florida counties bordering Alabama and Georgia,
neither of which has a legalized lottery, said lottery spokesman Ed
George.
   Half the sales at the Sing convenience store, about eight miles
south of the Georgia line, are to Georgia and Alabama residents.
One man purchased more than $500 worth of tickets Friday morning
for a lottery pool.
   ``He comes down every Friday,'' McMurtray said. ``The higher the
jackpot has been, the higher the influx of people from Georgia has
been.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But Postal Service regulations prohibit selling lottery
tickets through the mail.
   Many Lotto players dreamed of what it would be like to win.
   ``Parties, trips, plays, travel. I'd throw a big party first
thing,'' said Gail Thomas, a Georgia juvenile detention officer who
bought her tickets in the border town of Iamonia.
   Pasco Donald, 74, said he would remember his 12 children, 60
grandchildren and more than 50 great-grandchildren.
   ``I'd give each of them $1,000,'' he said. ``Well, maybe some of
them. Not all of them.''
   Despite the 14-million-to-1 odds of winning, the $1 Lotto
tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second Friday, said
George.
   Last week about 32 million tickets were sold for a $32 million
jackpot. This week, officials expected sales to hit 40 million. The
pot has been climbing because no one has won since Aug. 6.
   Officials said half of any week's sales are usually made on
Saturdays before computerized ticket machines shut down at 10:30
p.m. for the 11 p.m. drawing, which is televised.
   California set the world lottery jackpot record in June with a
$51.4 million prize that went to two people, said Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur.
   California's biweekly numbers game took 20 months to produce the
prize. It took Florida only four months to break the California
mark. The increase in Florida's jackpot was aided by the stiff odds
against winning _ among the highest of any state lottery.
   Players select six numbers from 1 to 49 and mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   Spain's ``El Gordo'' lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but
it was not a Lotto-style game.

   Lines were long and dreams were big for
tonight's $100 million Lotto drawing.
   It was possible, but not probable, that the jackpot will end up
at more than $115 million, the amount of the nation's highest,
Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Friday.
   The chance of a single winner was nearly one in 14 million,
which is the number of possible combinations of six numbers. It was
likelier the riches will be split among several winners.
   With 100 million tickets expected to be sold by tonight's
drawing, there was only one chance in 200 that no one will pick all
the winning numbers, lottery spokesman Ed George said.
   And they could come from anywhere.
   ``Everybody who knew I was coming to Florida this week wanted me
to buy them Lotto tickets,'' said Frank Greer, a Washington
campaign consultant for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lawton
Chiles. ``That's all anyone is talking about.''
   The state Lottery Department fielded calls from across the
country and Canada, George said.
   The $1 Lotto tickets were hustled for $3 to $5 at newsstands on
Wall Street and midtown Manhattan. A dry cleaning shop in
Washington, D.C., was shut down Friday for illegal sales.
Authorities said more than $1,000 in cash was seized along with a
lottery machine and gaming receipts.
   In Georgia, a couple who parked their pickup truck at a Macon
shopping mall and posted a sign saying ``Florida lottery tickets
for sale'' was arrested Wednesday on commercial gambling charges.
   Michael LaBruno, a self-proclaimed ``Lotto nut'' from Jersey
City, N.J., flew to Jacksonville and bought $7,600 in tickets at a
convenience store. It took almost five hours to process the tickets
and cost him $600 in air fare.
   Connecticut businesses that deliver tickets for out-of-state
lotteries were swamped with customers, most interested in the
Florida drawing.
   Thomas Wilkison, owner of the Manchester Lotto Express office,
said his office took orders for 20,000 tickets Wednesday. By
mid-afternoon Thursday, 17,000 more had been taken.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was $58 million, split
between five winners in April. Each winning ticket was worth almost
$11.7 million to be paid over 20 years.
   The record for a prize to a single winner of a computerized
numbers game is held by Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, who won a
$55.1 million Florida Lotto jackpot in September 1988.
   The current jackpot was missed four weeks in a row, rolling over
each time. Pennsylvania's lottery produced the nation's highest
jackpot in April 1989. It paid the holders of 14 winning tickets
$8.3 million over 26 years.
   Throughout the week in Florida, there were several reports of
Lotto players spending $10,000 on the weekly computerized game. But
not all were big spenders.
   A mother of three in Apopka bought a Lotto ticket with 100
pennies.
   ``It was all we had,'' said Melanie Faby, 37. ``If we win, I'll
start a foundation to help abused children and women.''

<HEAD>Couple Claims Richest Lotto Prize to a Single Winner in Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban couple came forward today to claim a
$42 million Lotto jackpot, the richest prize to a single-ticket
winner in Illinois State Lottery history.
   William and Kathleen Madigan, who formed the Madigan Partnership
to claim the prize, will receive 20 annual payments of $2.1 million,
officials said at a news conference.
   The Madigans, who live in Hometown, a southern suburb of Chicago,
bought their ticket for Saturday's Lotto drawing at a White Hen
Pantry in suburban Oak Lawn. The convenience store will receive
$420,000, 1 percent of their winnings, lottery officials said.
   Mike Wittkowski, a Chicago printer who was a 1984 Lotto winner,
held the previous state single-jackpot record of $40 million.
   The state's biggest jackpot ever was $69.9 million for the April
15 drawing this year, but the cash in that grand-prize pool was
divided four ways.
   The winner of the largest undivided lottery prize in the United
States was Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, Fla., who won $55.16
million in the Florida lottery on Sept. 3, 1988.
   Players in the Illinois Lottery select six numbers from 1 to 54.
A $1 ticket buys two plays. The winning numbers drawn Saturday night
were 6, 9, 33, 40, 51, 54.

   There's a new multimillionaire
somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers
needed to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least
$54 million, officials said Sunday.
   The winning $1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchased
in Longwood, a town of 14,500 in central Florida, Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winner
steps forward.
   Eight-digit riches were also doled out in New York, where one
winning ticket was purchased for a $23 million jackpot Saturday
night, and in Illinois, where holders of four winning tickets will
split a $21 million prize.
   The previous national record jackpot, $51.4 million, was shared
by two California lottery players in June. A Pennsylvania couple
had the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won
$46 million in 1987.
   The new Florida millionaire _ or millionaires, if several
persons shared the ticket _ get 180 days to claim the prize. The
earliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday.
   The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lottery
withholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes,
although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. Florida has no
state income tax.
   Splitting a $54 million payout into 20 installments, and
deducting 20 percent, would bring the annual check to $2.16 million.
   Officials had estimated Saturday's jackpot at $52 million, but a
last-minute frenzy of sales that sometimes topped 850 tickets a
second raised the total to $54 million. It could be even larger,
depending on final sales figures.
   Saturday sales totaled 14.6 million tickets, and total weekly
purchases were 44.78 million by the 11 p.m. drawing.
   Players had turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to
beat the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out
of 49. The winning numbers were 3-5-19-20-27-35.
   Until Saturday, there hadn't been a winner in the drawing since
Aug. 6. That boosted the jackpot with each passing week.
   ``This became an international news story. What better way to
let people know about your lottery than through an international
news story?'' Mrs. Paul said at a news conference. Florida began
its lottery only this year.
   At least $20 million of the week's lottery profits will go to
state education, she said.
   Longwood Mayor David R. Gunter said he was delighted to have the
$54 million ticket sold in his town. The bedroom community 18 miles
northeast of Orlando has several lottery outlets.
   ``I think we're due to be on the map,'' said Gunter. ``This is
one great way to put us on it. It's always good to have a small
city wake up and learn that one individual has had such fantastic
luck.''
   Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players won
smaller prizes.
   Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales.
   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto
News in Miami. ``It's madness.''
   Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited Florida's Lotto
with boosting their sales.
   ``That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery of
everyone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales,'' said
Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   As in Florida, the winners of the $21 million Illinois drawing
and the $23 million New York lottery were not immediately
identified.
   The winning ticket in New York was sold in prosperous
Westchester County, north of New York City, while the four winning
tickets in Illinois were sold in the suburbs of Chicago.
   Florida Lottery spokesman Ed George spoke via telephone on an
Arizona radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions from
people who wanted to play Florida's game.
   ``I told them to climb into a good solid car or buy a plane
ticket and come on out and visit,'' George said.

   Lottery officials waited today for the holders of
four tickets to step forward and claim a world-record jackpot of
$69.9 million.
   Holders of the tickets, whether it's one person, a couple or a
group, will split the pot, which was raised from $69 million today
after final sales were tallied.
   Two people, one in Chicago and one elsewhere in Illinois,
contacted state officials Sunday to report they held winning
tickets, but Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said the tickets would
have to be validated before the millionaires could be annointed.
   Officials today tentatively identified one winner as a man from
west central Illinois who planned to share the winnings with his
two sisters from Arizona. He was on his way to Chicago to have his
ticket validated, said lottery spokeswoman Carrie Worley.
   ``For all of you who said it's easier to be struck by lightning
than to win the Lotto, four people were struck last night and they
struck gold,'' Ms. Sharp said Sunday at a news conference.
   Each winner would get a $17.25 million share of the grand prize,
paid over 20 years, said Lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem. The total
could rise after final sales figures are tallied, she said.
   The winning numbers were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54.
   Hopeful players from around the country and world descended on
Illinois last week, buying record numbers of tickets that enabled
lottery officials to boost the prize. Some rerouted flights, others
called from as far away as Europe, Japan and South America to find
out how to get a piece of the action.
   Losers said they were disappointed but took their losses in
stride.
   ``I just got one ticket because ... if you're going to win,
you'll win with one,'' said Lonny Taylor, a systems engineer from
Chicago.
   In addition to the four big winners, Ms. Sharp said Saturday's
drawing produced 1,220 players who matched five of the six numbers
to win prizes of $2,316.50, and 73,452 who will receive $76.50 for
matching four of six.
   The jackpot beat the old world record of $61.98 million set in
October in California. That pot was split among three winning
tickets, one bought by an individual and the others bought by
groups of co-workers.
   The previous Illinois record jackpot of $40 million was won by
Chicago printer Mike Wittkowski in 1984.
   Ms. Sharp said sales for the week _ $56.5 million _ eclipsed
totals for the week leading up to the $40 million jackpot in 1984.
She said sales on Saturday reached 27,000 tickets per minute.
   ``It was a little hairy there for a while,'' she said.
   Forty cents on every dollar in Lotto proceeds goes to the state
for the Common School Fund, Ms. Sharp said. But since the amount of
money spent on schools is determined by state budget figures, the
additional revenue from last week's record sales will go into state
coffers not specifically slated for education, she said.
   If only one person had matched the numbers, the jackpot would
have been the largest paid to a single winner.
   But with four ticketholders sharing the pot, the largest single
winner in U.S. history remains Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs,
Fla., who walked away with $55.16 million in the Florida lottery in
September.
   Florida's Lotto jackpot is on the rise again, to an estimated
$37 million in next Saturday's drawing, its second highest level
after Ms. Ryan's winnings, because nobody won this weekend's $23
million prize, Lottery secretary Rebecca Paul announced Sunday.
   ``We're urging players to purchase their tickets early this week
to avoid the possiblity of longer lines Friday and Saturday,'' said
Mrs. Paul, who helped Illinois set up its lottery before she moved
south to Florida.

<TEXT>
   Florida's weekly Lotto jackpot was
raised to $90 million today as sales continued at a pace that could
send the game past the $100 million mark before Saturday night's
drawing.
   The overnight $10 million increase in the prize money was
announced by Susan Nefzger, spokeswoman for the lottery.
   On Saturday, there were no winning tickets in a $50 million
lottery. The next day, the jackpot for the coming Saturday was set
at $75 million; on Monday, it was raised to $80 million.
   For the jackpot to reach $100 million, lottery officials
calculate that the state will have to sell $98 million tickets this
week. The previous record was $56 million in sales in one week, set
in April.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Monday's sales raced well
ahead of the record pace.
   ``It's a little crazy here right now,'' she said. ``It's a
really hard issue for us because this is so outside of the norm.''
   April Fanaken of Fort Lauderdale was playing for the first time.
   ``I have never played. I am a teacher, and all my kids all day
long have been talking about `you never know,''' she said,
referring to the slogan used by the lottery.
   Extra maintenance people were added this week to keep terminals
working across the state and additional phone lines were installed
at lottery headquarters to handle increased telephone traffic, Mrs.
Paul said.
   The national record for a lottery prize is $115 million, which
was awarded in Pennsylvania to 14 ticket-holders, some of them
individuals and some groups.
   But the U.S. record of the largest single lottery prize still
goes to Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, who won a Florida Lotto
jackpot of $55.1 million two years ago.
   Lotto jackpots roll over when no one picks all the winning
numbers. The Lottery Department then estimates the size of the next
week's jackpot based on sales projections.
   The odds of someone picking the winning numbers are about
one-in-14 million.
   Another concern for lottery officials is the design of the
billboards announcing jackpot estimates, which don't have space for
a nine-figure jackpot. ``The boards were not originally prepared
for the extra digi,'' said Bernie Torra, spokesman for Ackerley
Communications of Miami, lottery billboard handlers in South
Florida. ``We're working on it.''

FT  20 JAN 94 / Technology: Lucky numbers - A network for Britain's national
lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH UNDERWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new national lottery opens for business in about a year, promising
big cash prizes to the punters and much-needed tax revenues for the UK
government.
For the consortium chosen to operate the lottery, however, it also poses
some daunting technical problems, not least of which will be setting up one
of the largest computer networks in the world in around six months.
The eight consortia expected to bid for the licence next month agree that,
while the technology involved is relatively simple, the sheer size of the
network, coupled with strict requirements for reliability and security, will
make building the necessary computer system a tortuous task.
Having stated its requirement, the government is leaving the specification
of the system to its potential suppliers. To be truly national, however, it
will need to cover more than 10,000 nationwide retail outlets at launch
time, rising swiftly to approach 25,000. Each will be installed with a
specially designed terminal connected to a central computer system handling
on-line transaction processing at speeds of up to 2,000 to 3,000
transactions a second at peak betting times, typically the hour before the
weekly jackpot is drawn.
A second computer centre, located at a separate site in case the first is
hit by disaster, will be on constant standby, ready to take up the
processing load should the lead computer system fail.
David Bale, chief executive of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission and a
consultant to UK bidder the Great British Lottery Company, warns against
over-ambition. 'The key is integrity. The system must do everything
properly, all the time. I would suggest that it would be irresponsible for
anyone to bid newly developed software for such a large system as the UK. It
must be well and truly tested, as must the hardware and communications
network.'
New Zealand's lottery, set up under Bale's guidance in 1987, has 700 outlets
but because of their geographical spread and the country's demographics, it
has proved a tough testing ground. Newsagents were initially connected to a
central system via New Zealand Telecom leased lines and modems, although the
network was digitised last year to improve availability and resilience as
well as to add new features such as an emergency satellite back-up service.
Bale's worst memory is the Saturday morning when a road digger sliced
through both the primary and secondary wires connecting 50 per cent of New
Zealand's lottery customers to the central system, jeopardising an equal
percentage of the week's income. In this instance, service was resumed by
5pm in time for intense activity before the 7pm weekly big prize draw.
Besides leased lines and locally connected circuits, communications
technologies which may be viable in the UK include cable, packet radio
networks, emerging integrated services, digital networks and, ultimately,
the latest generation of satellite services.
Bale cautions, however, against a mix-and-match approach to building the
communications network. 'Every time you add a new media, you add problems. I
would avoid it like the plague.
'BT's twisted-pair wiring goes everywhere in the UK and I believe it will
deliver a very resilient service.' With the investment in technology to set
up the network expected to be Pounds 200m or more, British
Telecommunications will not be the only supplier keen for a slice of the
action, although its involvement is almost guaranteed as Mercury has neither
the coverage, nor the experience, sought by the consortia.
Established suppliers of lottery system hardware include US companies
Digital Equipment Corporation, Concurrent Computers and Control Data, which
also offers complete systems through its subsidiary Automatic Wagering
International. Software and specialist terminals are dominated by US-based
G-Tech, with more than 60 per cent of the world market. It is also a member
of the Camelot consortium (backed by Cadbury Schweppes), although this will
not preclude other bidders from selecting its systems.
Specially designed G-Tech lottery terminals, bearing some resemblance to a
hybrid automatic teller machine and cash register, and made by consortium
partner ICL (the UK-based and Japanese-owned computer company), would be
installed in retail outlets with communication handled across a customised
network of mixed media chosen for its cost effectiveness.
Don Stanford, G-Tech's senior vice-president for technology, says: 'We need
to achieve over 99.98 per cent availability and total transaction times of
less than 5 seconds from when the customer hits the button to when he
receives a receipt. And we want to give retailers a terminal designed to
provide the power, capacity and speed to sell all game products within 5
seconds. In the UK, things will go wrong if the solution is not completely
integrated or properly tested.
'The hardest part of the job will be planning and tackling the complexity
involved to have everything online on day one. Besides the computer systems,
retailers need to be trained and there will be a high field service
requirement.' Although none of the consortia is prepared to commit itself,
Stanford - who masterminded the Texas and California state lotteries -
believes more than 500 jobs in manufacturing, operating the lottery and
servicing retail sites will be created by the consortium chosen to run the
lottery under the first seven-year licence.
IBM, the technical partner in the Lottery Foundation (formed by Richard
Branson, chairman of Virgin), endorses the need for systems integration. In
its self-appointed role as a services company rather than hardware supplier,
the US computer group will act as a project management and implementation
specialist.
To enhance its technical credibility in the eyes of the government selection
team, Rainbow, the group put together by advertising agency Leo Burnett
under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Sheehy (chairman of BAT Industries),
has enlisted a well-known technical expert. Peter Borer, formerly head of
British Rail's telecommunications arm, is, like his counterparts,
scrutinising all the technical options available.
As Bale points out: 'The UK lottery is the last big prize (in the gaming
sector) in the 20th century and probably the 21st. The battle will be in
marketing, but that must be supported by first-class gear.'

   Gtech Corp. said it was tentatively selected by the California State Lottery to provide and service from 2,500 to 7,000 terminals for the state's computerized lottery game.

   Gtech said the contract is subject to a "protest period" and ratification by the California lottery commission, and to a 60-day evaluation of the new terminals' compatibility with the state's existing lottery network.

   Gtech said gross revenue from the potential award could exceed $25 million.
Deliveries would begin this fall and continue for as long as two years, the company added.

   Gtech, which makes and operates computerized lottery systems, earned $7.7 million, or 81 cents a share, on revenue of $131.5 million for the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.

   Florida's Lotto jackpot reached an
estimated $96 million _ the second largest ever in the country _
after hopeful players Wednesday bought tickets at a rate of up to
300 every second.
   ``Will we go to $100 million? Anything is possible,'' Lottery
Secretary Rebecca Paul said.
   The national record is $115 million awarded to 14 ticket-holders
in Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   Florida ticket sales accelerated after nobody picked all six
numbers to win a $50 million jackpot Saturday.
   By 5 p.m. Wednesday, Florida sold 9.5 million $1 tickets for the
day, at a rate of up to 300 every second, Lottery Department
spokesman Ed George said. Ticket sales are expected to increase
Friday and Saturday.
   Among Wednesday's players were a Tampa father and son who came
to Lottery Department headquarters in Tallahassee and bought 10,000
tickets. It took nearly seven hours for the lottery computer to
print out all the tickets.
   ``I saved up for it. I figured it would be a good use,'' said
Anthony Giardino, 21. He bought 2,000 tickets _ 500 for friends _
and his father, who would not speak to reporters, bought 8,000.
They chose the numbers on 800 tickets and had the computer pick the
rest at random.
   ``I figured I have a good chance of winning,'' Giardino said.
   In reality, the odds of winning the jackpot are about 1-in-14
million, lottery officials estimate.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was a $58 million jackpot
split between five winners in April.
   Florida Lotto also holds the world record for largest single
prize for a computerized numbers game, $55.1 million to Sheelah
Ryan of Winter Springs in September 1988.

CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WON $1-BILLION PAYOFF FROM LOTTERY DURING YEAR

The California State Lottery hit the jackpot in the last fiscal year as
revenues reached $2.6 billion, lottery Executive Director Chon Gutierrez
announced Wednesday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Record-breaking fiscal 1988-89 lottery sales for the first time provided more
than $1 billion to the state's public education system, Gutierrez said. "We had
a terrific year, the best one yet."
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Unified School District is the second-largest recipient of
lottery money, trailing only Los Angeles schools, according to Lottery figures.
San Diego city schools will receive more than $20 million from 1988-89 lottery
proceeds, part of the $78 million due schools in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
School officials have already included the anticipated lottery revenues in the
district's current $540 million budget, said Acting Supt. Cathy Hopper. The
money is not designated for specific projects, and is used simply to balance
the books, Hopper said.
</P>
<P>
By law, at least 34% of lottery revenues is earmarked for public education, but
that number rose to 40% last year, according to Gutierrez. The lottery awarded
half of its income to prize winners and spent 10% on expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lottery's contributions to public schools rose by a third from the 1987-88
fiscal year, Gutierrez said. Lottery funds make up 3% of school budgets
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
The lottery distributes money to the school systems based on their size. For
the fiscal year that ended June 30, districts earned $181 from the lottery for
every student enrolled.
</P>
<P>
Lottery surveys show that 60% of Californians played the weekly Lotto or an
instant game within the last month, according to Gutierrez. Although state
residents are still buying only a third as many tickets per-capita as players
in Ohio and Massachusetts, sales for July point to the current fiscal year
being another record breaker, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Hopper said lottery experts have warned her district not to expect
another record-breaking year. "A lot of people have been telling us that the
lottery has peaked," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez disagreed. He said fully automated, self-service Lotto machines due
in San Diego within months, and a daily drawing game set to begin next year
will push sales higher.

   Three tickets were sold with the six
numbers needed to win California's $60.8 million lottery jackpot,
the largest in the world, officials said Sunday.
   Each of the tickets is worth a third of the jackpot. A pool of
15 hospital workers in San Diego County jubilantly claimed Sunday
that it held one of the winning tickets. However, lottery spokesman
Bob Taylor said he could not confirm that until the ticket stub is
verified, probably on Monday.
   The two other tickets with the six winning numbers were
purchased in Westminster in Orange County and in Sacramento, Taylor
said. Winners in those areas had not come forward.
   Workers at Fallbrook Hospital told The Associated Press they
went together to purchase $600 worth of tickets.
   Carrie Dragon, a 38-year-old pharmacy technician, said she
joined 13 nurses, lab technicians and other hospital employees, as
well as a friend of one worker, in putting $40 each toward the
tickets.
   She said all agreed they would split what winnings came from the
``Quick Pick'' tickets. ``Quick Pick'' means that the numbers were
selected at random by one of the computerized lotto terminals.
   The tickets were purchased at a Circle K convenience store, she
said. Lottery officials verified that the winning ticket in
Fallbrook was purchased at a Circle K.
   The hospital workers in the pool held a party to watch Saturday
night's drawing.
   ``The lady who found we had a winning ticket screamed,'' said
Dragon. ``Everybody was just amazed. Then everybody started
dreaming about what we were going to do with the money.
   ``I'm going to set up trust funds for my four kids and pay off
bills,'' she said. ``But for Thanksgiving, we're all going to go to
Hawaii, or some place like that.''
   She said the ticket was placed in a bank vault.
   Lottery spokeswoman Susan Kossack said each winner will receive
$20,296,175, a third of the $60,888,525 jackpot, in installments
over 20 years. The installments will amount to $810,666 annually
after taxes, she said.
   If verified, the hospital pool ticket would be worth more than
$67,600 annually before taxes for 20 years to each of the 15
people. The lottery pays out only to a single winner, the person
holding the winning ticket. Arrangements for dividing the money
would be the responsibility of the group.
   Dragon said two hospital workers, Duff Stone and Charlie Jett,
bought the tickets for the group. An unidentified woman who
answered the telephone at Stone's home said reporters would have to
wait to talk to the winners at a lottery office on Monday.
   The winning numbers selected in the televised Saturday night
drawing were: 5, 20, 26, 28, 32, and 39. The bonus number was 3.
   The jackpot was the world's largest lottery prize, according to
Taylor.
   The previous world record jackpot was $56 million in Spain's El
Gordo lottery in 1983, according to Sam Valenza, publisher of
Lottery Players magazine in Moorestown, N.J. But in Spain's
lottery, players don't choose their numbers, which are already
printed on tickets, and several winning entries are guaranteed in
each of the five or six drawings held each year.
   The previous North American record was a $55.16 million jackpot
in a Florida lottery last month. That prize went to a single winner.
   Saturday's California drawing climaxed a week of frenzied lotto
ticket buying throughout the state, with gamblers wagering about
$106 million, Taylor said.
   ``All these figures are records,'' Kossack added.
   Saturday's sales hit $39.5 million, officials said. At 6:32 p.m.
Saturday, the high sales point, more than 86,000 tickets were being
sold each minute. In the heaviest hour, from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Saturday, about 4.3 million of the $1 tickets were sold.
   The Saturday jackpot soared because on Wednesday, for the fourth
consecutive time, nobody picked the six winning numbers between 1
and 49. Wednesday's $33.4 million jackpot was rolled over to the
Saturday game and grew with each ticket sale.
   Residents of Nevada, which has legalized gambling but no state
lottery, accounted for some of the sales, officials said.
   The busiest store Saturday was in the Sierra Nevada community of
Truckee, 20 miles southwest west of Reno, Nev., with sales of
$47,652.
   For the week, the busiest retailer was a store in Baker, 80
miles southwest of Las Vegas, that has only one lotto sales
terminal but logged $162,014 in sales.
   Lottery tickets with five winning numbers plus the bonus number
will pay $261,977 each to 29 players, while five numbers without
the bonus will pay $3,742 each to 1,046 players, said Taylor.

   Floridians snatched up Lotto jackpot
tickets Thursday, the day after officials upped the pot to $52
million, a world record for lotteries where the winner can take all.
   By noon, Thursday's ticket sales topped 2 million, a 51.8
percent increase over the 1.3 million tickets sold all day a week
earlier when residents were trying to win a $32 million jackpot.
   More than 13 million of the $1 tickets have been sold so far
this week, a 36.7 percent increase over the 9.6 million sold by the
same time last week.
   Since no one picked the six numbers drawn Saturday, the $32
million prize, which included the grand prizes of the two previous
weeks, was rolled over to be included in this week's jackpot.
   No one has won the grand prize in the weekly numbers game since
Aug. 6, when a Brandon woman won a $26 million jackpot.
   Lottery officials increased this week's jackpot from $50 million
to $52 million based on estimates that 40 million tickets would be
sold, according to Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul. Last week some
32 million tickets were sold.
   It took Florida only four months to break the world record for a
Lotto prize, which California set in June with a $51.4 million
prize that went to two people. California's biweekly numbers game
was 21 months old when it produced that jackpot.
   That had been the world record, according to Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication based in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur. Spain's El Gordo lottery
registered a $56 million jackpot in 1983, but Valenza said Spain's
lottery was very different from Florida's Lotto game.
   In Spain's lottery, players don't choose their numbers, which
are already printed on tickets. Also, several winning entries are
guaranteed in each of the five or six drawings held each year.

<LEADPARA>  California Lottery officials are considering a proposal to reduce the schools'
percentage of lottery proceeds to increase the prize pool, lottery director
Chon Gutierrez said.;    Gutierrez said Thursday he would support the plan
only if research indicated it would result in a large enough increase in
ticket sales to offset the lower percentage for schools.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LOTTERY DEBATES PLAN TO REDUCE SCHOOLS' PERCENTAGE
OFFICIALS SAY 6/53 IS STILL A BIG LOSER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But school officials vowed to oppose any reduction in their share.;
"Absolutely, we would fight it," said California Superintendent of Public
Instruction Bill Honig. "Tell them to take it out of their share instead.";
Schools now get 34 percent of all lottery money. Fifty percent is set aside
for prizes, and 16 percent goes to lottery administration.;    In response to
slumping lottery revenues, Gutierrez told the California Lottery Commission on
Wednesday that he would recommend scrapping the Lotto 6/53 game for a format
with better odds of winning.;    At a news conference Thursday, Gutierrez said
changes in the lotto game would be recommended as part of an overhaul of all
lottery games in an attempt to build participation.;    Los Angeles Unified
School District officials, who just cut more than $274 million from their
district's budget, said the district would be devastated by a reduction in
lottery revenues.;    "I'm in such shock I'm still trying to pick my jaw off
the floor," said Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein. "It's
absolutely appalling news. We're talking about an 'Alice in Wonderland'
approach to a measure that was passed by the voters precisely to be used for
education.";    In addition to setting aside more money for prizes, Gutierrez
said lottery officials would propose adding games based on themes now
prohibited, such as horse racing and poker.;    Gutierrez said lottery
marketing specialists are studying the feasibility of the various proposals
and said that he will ask the Lottery Commission, at its Sept. 17 meeting, to
endorse those ideas considered most likely to increase lottery revenues.;
He acknowledged that changing the percentage of revenues going to schools --
which would require approval of the California Legislature -- would not be
easy. But he said the change could be beneficial if it boosts participation in
the games and increases revenues to schools.;    "These things have to be
addressed. It's time to make some changes," Gutierrez said.;    Lottery sales
are in their third consecutive year of decline, after peaking at $2.6 billion
in the 1988-89 fiscal year.;    "Lotto 6/53 produced a world record $118.8
million jackpot and slowed the year-long lotto sales decline that occurred in
the last year of 6/49, but it didn't stop the decline," Gutierrez said.;
Gutierrez rejected Honig's suggestion to cut the amount of lottery revenues
going to administer the games of chance. Of the 16 cents of every dollar that
goes to administration, he said retailers get 6 cents and the advertising
budget takes 2 cents, leaving 8 cents for administrative costs such as
salaries, ticket printing, and computers.;    Gutierrez told the Lottery
Commission on Wednesday that players were staying away from the 6/53 game
because of a perception that its astronomical odds make it impossible to win.
One lottery commissioner recommended an immediate return to the 6/49 game
abandoned in favor of the 6/53 game in June 1990, but the other commissioners
opted to wait until next month's meeting to take any action.;    The lottery
director said other alternatives that might be considered by the commission
next month include:;    (check) Recommending that the Legislature allow games
now barred under the 1984 initiative that created the lottery, such as games
with horse racing or poker themes. Those prohibitions were included in the
original law to minimize opposition from Nevada casinos.;    (check) Starting
a public relations campaign to inform people where the lottery money goes and
how it helps schools and emphasizing that local school districts are free to
budget it as they see fit.;    (check) Changing the lotto game so that the
public believes it is "more winnable." The odds are 23 million-to-one against
picking six numbers right in the 6/53 game. In the 6/49 game, the odds against
a perfect card were 14 million-to-one.;    (check) Maximizing the amount of
prize money retailers may pay to winners in cash. Winners of $100 or more now
must wait several weeks for the state to determine that the person does not
owe money to the state. Gutierrez proposed raising the instant cash prize
limit to $599, the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.;
(check) Selling two chances for $1, rather than at a dollar each, and
elimination of the "quick pick" option. When players use the quick-pick method
and allow a computer to choose their numbers, it tends to distribute the
numbers further across the possible combinations than those chosen by
players.; Putting the spin on lottery; In addition to reducing the percentage
of lottery revenues for schools, the state lottery commission will be asked to
consider:; (box)Recommending that the Legislature allow games currently
barred, such as games with horse racing or poker themes.; (box)Starting a
public relations campaign to inform people where the lottery money goes and
how it helps schools.; (box)Changing the lotto game to make it 'more

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. is about to take a spin
on creating the nation's first coast-to-coast lottery game.
   Disney's Buena Vista Television unit has teamed up with a
national group of state lottery directors to launch a
half-hour syndicated game show that would revolve around a
nationwide lottery. If all goes well, Disney and lottery
officials say the show will be on the air by the fall of 1992
and offer millions of dollars in pooled prizes every day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Disney and the gambling officials hope to tap into the
enormous popularity of televised state lottery drawings,
which lottery experts say can draw tremendous audiences. By
teaming big daily prizes with the excitement and atmosphere
of a game show, lottery officials hope to entice new players
and re-excite those who have become somewhat bored with their
own state lotteries.
   If all 33 state and the District of Columbia lotteries
participate, lottery experts say the game could reach 85% of
the nation's population. "This will offer state lotteries a
new way to expand their business," says Peter Lynch,
president of Lottery Innovations Corp., an industry group
with representatives from 22 state lotteries. "Every lottery
in the country has expressed interest in this."
   The concept has lottery directors' juices flowing, but the
game has a way to go before it is beamed into America's
living rooms. Mr. Lynch says the partners have yet to design
the show, and they must still decide such details as how
individual state lotteries would sell the game pieces or how
prizes will be structured. Although there are federal
statutes barring the mailing of state lottery tickets and
other related acts, Mr. Lynch says, there aren't any statutes
prohibiting a national lottery-type game.
   Neither partner would disclose what the potential profits
from the venture might be or how they would be divided. If
the game did reach 85% of the population, or roughly 180
million people, Mr. Lynch says, "a realistic worst-case
scenario of 10 cents per capita per week is very, very
achievable."
   In other words, if 10% of the people play $1 a week, that
would produce $18 million a week in sales. That, in turn,
would produce a minimum of $9 million a week in prizes, or
about $1.8 million a day. In practice, the figures could
climb much higher.
   The game's most likely format, he says, is a so-called
"on-line" computerized lottery game in which game pieces
could be purchased from any of the nation's 100,000 lottery
agents. "You take home the piece and watch the show that
night, and participate in it," Mr. Lynch says. "You have a
real interest in rooting for the outcome."
   Disney officials say that player interaction will be the
key to the show's success. "We have to create an
entertainment show that stands on its own," says Randy Reiss,
executive vice president of the Walt Disney Studios. If
Disney succeeds, the game could have appeal even in states
that don't have lotteries, he adds.
   Moreover, the show could be pitched to local advertisers,
such as fast-food outlets, who could run their own games tied
to the show. A point-of-purchase game piece from a hamburger
chain, Mr. Reiss says, could get viewers to tune in in
non-lottery states.
   Since lotteries were introduced in the mid-1960s, states
have used them to help fill cash-strapped coffers. Lottomania
pumped more than $7 billion into education, senior citizens'
programs and other causes last year alone. Estimated 1990
lottery sales rose to a record $20 billion, although the
approximate 6% increase was the smallest since 1987.
   In the short term, many lottery officials say the current
recession is chipping away at customers' discretionary
income, effectively disproving the belief that gambling is
recession-proof. Sales have been affected in New York and a
number of other states, but overall the industry shows signs
of stable single-digit growth.
   Some lotteries have discovered that bigger jackpots alone
no longer guarantee player interest, but the daily prizes may
well be enough to catch the interest of rank-and-file lottery
players. On-line computerized lotteries account for the
lion's share of all lottery sales, with only about a quarter
of revenues coming from "instant" scratch-off tickets and
other niche games.
   While the televised show holds promise for lotteries, the
format that may have the greatest potential -- and that faces
the biggest hurdles -- would be a game in which players could
buy tickets and participate in other ways over the phone. A
television show tie-in would provide excitement and engage
players, things that make casino gambling popular. The
Disney-state lottery game won't involve telephones.
   "Some states are heavily involved with the possibility of
betting over the telephone and others are very far away from
it," Mr. Lynch says. "That's not something we're going to get
involved with."

   A 63-year-old real estate agent who
``always needs money'' randomly picked numbers from the front page
of a newspaper to beat the 14 million-to-1 odds for Florida's
Lotto, winning a U.S. record $55 million.
   Sheelah Ryan, 63, said Wednesday her winning six-number
combination _ 3, 5, 19, 20, 27 and 35 _ was drawn from the first
six numbers she saw in The Orlando Sentinel last week. She then
bought her ticket near her home in central Florida's Winter Springs.
   Twice earlier, Ms. Ryan said she had $4 winners in Florida's
8-month-old lottery. Since then, she bought five tickets each week
but was stunned when she watched Saturday's drawing on television
and realized she was rich.
   ``I just kept saying `Oh, my God!''' she told a room packed with
journalists as she was introduced at the Florida Lottery Department
offices.
   Her first call was to her lawyer. ``She told me not to leave the
house,'' Ms. Ryan said, calling Wednesday a day of firsts.
   ``Today I had my first plane ride. It is not that I'm afraid. I
never had a reason to fly before,'' she said. ``This is my first
press conference. And this is the first time I ever won $55
million.''
   The prize was the largest single lottery jackpot in U.S.
history. The odds of winning were estimated by lottery officials at
14 million to 1.
   Previously, the largest single jackpot was Pennsylvania's $46
million that went to Donald R. Woomer Sr. and Linda K. Despot, a
couple from Hollidaysburg, Pa., last October. Two individual
ticket-buyers divided a $51.4 million California lottery jackpot in
June.
   Publicity from Florida's jackpot spurred a buying frenzy before
Saturday night's drawing here and in Illinois and New York, lottery
officials in those states said.
   Saturday night's prizes in New York and Illinois totaled $44
million, bringing the night's take for the three states to nearly
$100 million.
   The winner of the New York lottery's second largest prize, $23
million, was a 29-year-old truck driver who also presented his
ticket Wednesday, then announced his retirement, kissed his wife
and forecast a rosy future.
   ``Right now we're just going to stick with the simple things,''
said Anthony Valentino of Port Chester. ``Maybe a house, a couple
of cars. Put money away for my son. Maybe another baby. That's
about it.''
   In Illinois, four ticket-buyers split a $21 million jackpot. As
of Wednesday afternoon, only one of the four had come forward.
   Florida's new winner said she didn't know if she'd keep her job
or what she would buy when the state next week hands over the first
installment of $2,767,361 _ minus 20 percent that goes to the
Internal Revenue Service. She will receive 19 other slightly
smaller payments.
   ``I've always been middle class and the middle class always
needs money,'' said the New York native, who moved to Florida in
1975.
   ``I can buy an awful lot of things now,'' said Ms. Ryan, who is
single, has no children but has a brother and nephews in New York.
``I'm overwhelmed.''
   Before Ms. Ryan claimed her prize, dozens of people claimed they
had the winning ticket.
   One claimant, a janitor named Charles Hill, submitted a machine
copy of the purported winning ticket Wednesday, saying the original
had been damaged in the laundry.
   Hill's claim was enough to get him a $23,000 van with no cash
down from a car dealer.
   ``We're sorry for him, but we're not too shook up about it,''
said Tommy Thomas, owner of a Panama City Chevrolet dealership. He
said he expects to get the van back. ``Maybe we'll raffle it off.''

<HL> REGIONS:
Multistate Lottery's Prospects
Grow, Even Absent Big States
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 08/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell.
So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of your potential customers are playing the multimillion-dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home.

   That's exactly what Iowa and Missouri, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring Illinois, hope to do.
Starting early next year, Iowa and Missouri plan to join forces with several other states in a coast-to-coast, multistate lottery.

   The idea is to promote the same lottery"America's Game" is one of the names being considered -- in states from Oregon to Rhode Island.
The states would be linked by satellite every Saturday night for the weekly drawing.

   The new game is likely to hurt ticket sales in participating states' existing lotteries.
But organizers of the multistate game are betting that the public's usual response to lotteries will prevail.
That is, a large population base will produce lots of ticket sales, which will build big jackpots, which will inspire even more sales, far outweighing any revenue loss in single-state games.
As usual in the lottery business, the odds of winning will be infinitesimal.

   THE BIG QUESTION is membership.
Six states, with a combined population of 16 million, already are committed to the plan: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia.
The District of Columbia says it's in, too.
If past experience is any guide, that should make the multistate lottery one of the nation's richest games of chance.

   It would be richer still if New York and Illinois, both early supporters of the multistate idea, weren't sitting on the sidelines.
Illinois Gov. James Thompson is stringing out a decision whether to participate.
New York's lottery director, John Quinn, says his state won't play unless Illinois does. (New York's legislature needs to approve the state's multistate membership; a bill to that effect apparently died last month when the assembly recessed.)

   Signing up the two big states would triple the multistate lottery's projected population base to 45 million.
The small states think this is wonderful, because residents of Iowa or West Virginia would have a shot -- albeit tiny -- at a huge grand prize in a homestate lottery.
Ticket sales in those states would presumably soar.

   THE RATIONALE BEHIND LOTTERIES, after all, is to raise money for state government programs and thus ease the bite on taxpayers.
Oregon's lottery, just two years old, has already earned $70 million for state economic development programs ranging from new university buildings to commercial fishing piers.
In Illinois, 42% of lottery income goes to elementary and secondary schools.
Last year, that came to $553 million.

   Indeed, Illinois, with its own popular lottery, has less incentive than the smaller states to join the multistate lottery.
It was Illinois, after all, that produced the richest prize won by a single ticketholder in a North American lottery: $40 million in September 1984.
The huge pot came after the lottery went four weeks without a winner, the grand prize rolling over and growing each week.

   "During those four weeks, we had tremendous ticket sales," recalls Michael Jones, Illinois's lottery superintendent at the time and now a Chicago-based lottery consultant.

   It's what lottery directors dream about: a game designed in such a way that every so often, no one wins the grand prize for two or three weeks in a row.
The prize money builds, newspapers and television give the game big coverage, and people line up everywhere to buy tickets in a sort of gambler's feeding frenzy.

   But Illinois's grand prize hasn't come close to that level since , leading the state's lottery strategists to wonder how to boost business.
One way is to join the multistate game.
Rebecca Paul, who resigned as Illinois's lottery director last week to head Florida's new lottery, thinks that's the wave of the future.
In Canada, Australia, Switzerland and West Germany, multistate or multiprovince lotteries are the most widely played.
"I think that's where we're headed three to five years from now," Ms. Paul says.

   MR. JONES FORESEES a different format.
"I see the large states getting together in a super lotto."
He suggests a "triangle game" with Florida, New York and Illinois, or a Great Lakes regional lottery, with Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.
There is a precedent: Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont already run a lottery called Tristate Megabucks.

   Ms. Paul, whose Florida game will begin Jan. 15, doesn't like the idea of such fragmented lotteries.
"I think it's bad for the industry to have competing multistate games," she says.

   Multistate games aren't the only way to draw more players; states can also change the odds on an existing game.
Illinois did that in April, introducing a new Wednesday night lotto drawing that makes it easier to win a cheap prize (last week it was one chance in 89 to win $12 on a $1 ticket), but tougher to win the grand prize (one chance in 15.4 million).
The idea paid off late last month, when the jackpot reached $22 million, Illinois's highest in three years.

   As for the multistate plan, Sharon Sharp, who took over yesterday as Illinois lottery director, says she hasn't made up her mind about Illinois membership.
If the answer is yes, Chicago will be the site of the weekly multistate lottery drawing.
If Illinois says no, the winning numbers will be picked in Des Moines, Iowa.

   Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot
to $62 million today _ a national record _ as gamblers and dreamers
from as far away as Europe clamored to play.
   The geographical range is ``something we've never seen before,''
Illinois Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday.
   Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed
Lotto booths, where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just
about double the average, said Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, which runs the six Lotto kiosks.
   ``Who knows when the wheel of fortune spins or not?'' said
ticket-buyer Arthur Beane, a salesman from South Carolina.
   ``I want to win,'' said Florida developer Jack Ross.
   Ticket sales were also particularly brisk at lottery outlets
near Illinois' borders with Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri, as
residents from those states flocked to get in on the action.
   ``They're ordering them by the hundreds. One runner from Indiana
just bought $3,200 worth,'' sat Pat Poulos of the Deluxe Restaurant
in Danville.
   The Illinois jackpot had risen to $58 million by Friday morning.
And shortly after noon, lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem announced it
had swollen to $62 million _ topping the old record of $61.98
million set last October in California.
   Three winning tickets were bought in the California lottery, and
two of the three tickets had been purchased by groups of
co-workers, so the winnings were actually split more than 40 ways.
The largest lottery prize that went to a single ticket buyer was
claimed last September, when a Florida woman won $55 million.
   Ticket sales have increased the Illinois jackpot _ already
swollen by rollovers from three straight winless drawings _ by $5
million each day since Sunday.
   More than 23 million tickets had been sold by late Thursday.
   Ms. Rem said officials have received inquiries about the drawing
from California, Tennessee, Texas and other states.
   ``We've also gotten calls from Europe _ England, the Netherlands
_ with people asking how they can play,'' she said.
   Ticket sales have broken records every day this week. A total of
7.5 million tickets were sold Wednesday, a 20 percent increase over
the previous mark for a Wednesday set in 1986, Ms. Rem said.
   Each $1 ticket has two plays. In each bet, the bettor _ or the
computer _ picks six numbers between 1 and 54. The odds of winning
the Lotto on a two-play ticket are 12.9 million to one.

   Owners of six winning tickets will
split a record Florida Lotto jackpot of an estimated $105 million,
lottery officials said Sunday.
   Each of the tickets, bearing the numbers 5-6-21-34-35-45, is
worth an estimated $17.5 million, said Lottery Secretary Rebecca
Paul.
   The numbers were drawn at 11 p.m. Saturday, ending a week of
lottomania in which more than 100 million $1 tickets were sold,
sometimes at the rate of some 44,500 tickets a minute.
   The week followed four weeks in which there had been no Lotto
jackpot winner, pushing the grand prize to its near-record height.
In the history of state lotteries in the Unitd States, only a $115
million Lotto jackpot in Pennsylvania last year has been higher. In
that drawing, 14 winning tickets were sold.
   With no single ticket holder taking home the $105 million this
time, the U.S. record holder for a single winning lottery ticket
remains Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs. She bought the only lucky
ticket in a $55.16 million Florida lottery drawing two years ago.
   Winning ticket holders in Saturday's drawing had to wait until
lottery offices opened Monday to validate the tickets and begin the
process of claiming their winnings, which will be paid off over 20
years.
   Some of the umpteen million losers had plenty to say, though.
   ``I just lost miserably,'' said Victor Morgan, who said he
bought two tickets. ``But I've wasted my money on worse things.''
He watched the drawing at Sharkey's Shrimp Bar in downtown Miami.
   Jennifer Kram, who matched just three numbers on one of her 20
tickets, ``I'm very depressed. Three isn't good enough for me. I
wanted at least $500,000.'' The three-number match will bring her a
grand total of $5.50.
   Mrs. Paul hinted at the exhaustion the week had brought lottery
officials.
   ``I think we're happy,'' she said at a midday news conference.
``I think we're glad it's over. But it's been fun and exciting.''
   She said the estimated jackpot of $105 million - ``give or take
a dollar or two'' - was based on last week's interest rates and
total sales of more than 109 million tickets. Earlier, the jackpot
was predicted to total $100 million.
   The six tickets were sold in New Smyrna Beach, Coconut Creek,
Venice, Miami, Winter Haven and Longwood.
   She said there were nearly 2 million winners overall, including
1,581 tickets with five out of the six numbers. Those players will
get $4,488 each. The 96,036 tickets with four of the six numbers
are worth $108 each. Some 1.8 million who picked three of the six
numbers will take home $5.50 each.
   The most popular combination was the simplest: 1,2,3,4,5,6. More
than 52,000 tickets had those six numbers, Mrs. Paul said.
   Had those turned out to be the winners, the per-ticket payout
would have been about $1,000, paid out in a lump sum rather than
over 20 years.
   The jackpot for this week's game, to be decided Saturday night,
was estimated at $9 million, lottery officials said.
   By law, half of every $1 spent on a Florida lottery ticket is
returned to the players in the form of prizes. At least 38{ percent
goes to education and the rest is spent on retailers and
administration.

   Jackpot fantasies are in full bloom in
Florida, where Lottery players snapped up tickets at 500 a second
in hopes of winning an estimated $100 million.
   ``I'm getting lost with all the zeroes,'' said Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul, who added a ninth digit Thursday to the projected
jackpot.
   No more projections will be announced before Saturday night's
televised drawing, she said.
   A $100 million jackpot would be the second largest in U.S.
history. State lottery officials doubted the jackpot would break
the $115 million record split among 14 winning tickets in
Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   The number of winners will be announced Sunday. The final size
of the jackpot will not be determined until Monday, Mrs. Paul said.
   The heaviest ticket sales Thursday were reported along Florida's
borders with Georgia and Alabama. Tickets are not sold outside the
state.
   Joe Revolta and Robert Bache traveled from New Orleans to buy
10,000 tickets at $1 apiece at Groovin' Noovin's, a Pensacola
convenience store near the Alabama-Florida state line.
   ``You might not have much of a chance, but you have even less if
you don't play,'' Revolta said.
   Long-distance telephone calls poured into the state to friends
and relatives asked to buy tickets for thousands of people
attracted by the huge prize.
   Lotto mania even brought warnings from Lotto officials to spend
prudently, and a gamblers' group questioned why the lottery is not
providing money to treat compulsive gamblers.
   ``Half of the people in one Gamblers Anonymous meeting said they
were tempted because of the lottery,'' said Paul Ashe, executive
director of the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling.
   To play the Florida Lotto game, players select six numbers from
one to 49. The winning numbers are chosen at random during a
weekly, televised drawing.
   The odds of one ticket containing all six winning numbers are
about one-in-14 million. But for every dollar spent, there was a
dream.
   ``I'd get a 200-foot yacht and staff it with chicks in bikinis
from stem to stern and go to Europe,'' said 19-year-old Ricky Ford,
a Tallahassee college student who spent $20 on tickets.
   ``First, I would help the church in any way I could, then I
would by a ticket to fly to the moon,'' said Anne Straub, 66, of
Gulf Breeze. ``I've just always wanted to go into space.''
   Bahamians carrying thousands of dollars are flying to South
Florida to buy lottery tickets to resell at a higher price back
home, the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported.
   ``They come every Friday. This week they will bring $4,000 to
$5,000,'' said George Prado, who sells lottery tickets at the
Caribe Cafeteria, a Cuban restaurant near the Miami International
Airport.

   Lottery players streamed to ticket outlets
across California Saturday, hoping to pick the winning numbers in a
national record jackpot estimated at $51.2 million.
   By the time the drawing took place Saturday night, the odds of
winning were about one in 14 million, said state lottery officials.
As usual, lottery computers will not determine whether anyone has
won the jackpot until Sunday. A winner would not be verified until
Monday.
   Ticket sales on Saturday alone reached more than $33 million, a
one-day all time high, lottery spokesman Bob Taylor said.
   ``At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the lotto prize past $46
million,'' he said, ``past the Pennsylvania record.''
   The nation's previous richest lottery prize, $46 million, was
awarded in Pennsylvania in October. The biggest previous California
jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two players in October.
   ``There's no way we could have predicted anything like this,''
Taylor said in releasing the anticipated sum and a statement from
Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez calling sales a ``phenomenal tidal
wave.''
   Many stores brought in extra help to keep up with ticket sales.
   ``I cannot handle it. Too many people,'' said Paul Lee, owner of
the New Lun Wah grocery store in San Francisco's Chinatown, where 50
people lined up for tickets Saturday morning.
   ``It's been crazy,'' said Alex Lichine, manager of Lichine's
Liquor, Deli and Catering store in Sacramento. ``It's going to get
worse. Everybody's playing today. Everybody's playing four or five
times more than normal.''
   Ticket buyers forked over dollars at the rate of $2 million per
hour statewide, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   A player beating the 1-in-14 million odds of winning the jackpot,
which began growing when there were no winners in several previous
drawings of the Lotto 6-49 game, would receive the money, after
federal taxes, in an annuity paid over 20 years.
   The actual size of the jackpot depended on how many tickets were
sold.
   The winning numbers, six of 49, were picked in a 7:56 p.m.
drawing in Sacramento. They were: 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. The bonus
number was 37.
   ``I tell you the sky's the limit today. We had almost $5 million
(in ticket sales) at 10 o'clock today,'' said Taylor. ``Last
Saturday at this time we had $904,000. These figures are just mind
boggling.''
   As the game heated up, a Los Angeles psychologist cautioned
players not to fall victim to what he called ``lottery fantasy
syndrome.''
   ``People purchase a ticket, ignore the odds and start thinking of
the impossible: quitting their jobs, buying items that they have
always wanted, going places that they have never been, and some even
think of divorcing their spouses and starting their lives completely
over,'' said Robert Butterworth.
   The jackpot lured players across state and national borders.
   Leo Gronich, owner of Garlan's Inc., a Calexico department store
with a currency exchange, said some players were Mexicans trading
pesos for tickets. Oregon residents drove south to Yreka, Calif.,
for tickets, said clerk Dan Jerden at Sports and Spirits.
   At Tahoe Tom's in South Lake Tahoe, the fat pot drew Nevada
residents across the border, three blocks away.
   ``We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the
(ticket) line up to the state line and have the casino executives
wonder what's going on,'' said owner Tom Erickson.
   What to do with the enormous sum?
   ``Party forever,'' said Leslie Beagle, 43, of Riverside, as she
plunked down $10 for her shot at the jackpot.
   ``You'd probably have to take six months off to think about it,''
said Bill Masterson, 46, of South Lake Tahoe, who planned to buy
five tickets.

Prospective millionaires jammed convenience stores, supermarkets and gas
stations from Pensacola to Key West Friday in the waning hours of a weeklong
buying frenzy that has produced a record Florida Lotto jackpot that may yet
grow into the richest in history.
</P>
<P>
The estimated payoff: $100 million plus.
</P>
<P>
The odds of winning: 1 in 13,983,816.
</P>
<P>
The number of players who don't believe they'll win: 0.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks they're going to win," said Dave Sweezy, director of the Miami
regional lottery office. "I guess that's human nature. But we are urging
moderation, reminding them it only takes one."
</P>
<P>
Try telling that to the lady who flew in from Las Vegas Friday morning and
bought 1,200 of the $1 tickets. Or the players in Tampa and Pensacola who each
bought $10,000 worth of tickets. Or Michael Taylor, a 21-year-old University of
Miami student who Friday afternoon stood in line behind about 30 other hopefuls
in a Circle K store in Coral Gables. "I already had 10 tickets," he said, "but
then I thought of some more numbers. And I just had a feeling. So I'm back to
buy five more."
</P>
<P>
Despite radio spots from the lottery commission and advice from Florida Gov.
Bob Martinez to "play responsibly," something akin to gold-rush fever continues
to rage. "People are coming in with $100, $200, even $300, and they all think
that, with a little luck, it could be them," said Frank Soler, owner of Frank's
Discount in Miami. Many are first-time players. Most players normally spend no
more than $5 or $10 a week on the lottery, he added.
</P>
<P>
In Miami's Latino neighborhoods, this lottery prize is called "el gordo," the
fat one. But people from all over the country are seeing it as the chance of a
lifetime. "I've had calls from every state," said Sweezy, including one from
California, where a group of investors offered a check for $13.9 million in
exchange for tickets covering every possible combination.
</P>
<P>
Sweezy explained that it would take one terminal 63 weeks to print out 13.9
million tickets. "These people aren't thinking," he added.
</P>
<P>
So many out-of-state players have been driving into Florida that the lottery
commission set up an extra 30 terminals along the Georgia and Alabama borders.
Hundreds of Bahamians have flown into Miami this week to buy thousands of
tickets, most for illegal resale in the islands, officials admit.
</P>
<P>
It's been four weeks since anyone has picked the right six numbers in the
weekly Lotto game, and the prize has ballooned to the highest since the Florida
lottery was begun in May, 1988. The largest lottery jackpot on record is the
$115 million awarded earlier this year in Pennsylvania. That mark could be
topped, officials say, if sales Friday and today, typically the biggest of the
week, continue at the current pace and if the computers hold up.
</P>
<P>
At their peak Friday afternoon, the lottery's 7,500 terminals were spitting out
tickets at the rate of almost 600 per second.
</P>
<P>
While nothing is expected to slow Florida's Lottomania until sales are cut off
30 minutes before today's drawing at 11 p.m., one tragic reminder that money
does not guarantee happiness did surface earlier in the week. The body of a
35-year-old man was pulled from the Miami River Thursday morning, a week after
he had claimed $10,000 won in a scratch-off lottery game. He had $2,505 in his
pocket and an empty wine bottle stuck in the front of his pants, police said.
The county medical examiner Friday ruled his death an accidental drowning.

   For the past few months, the Ohio Lottery has
been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of Cleveland Stadium
reminding fans that a $3 million lottery jackpot isn't ``chicken
feed'' or ``chopped liver.''
   During an era when jackpots around the country are regularly
topping $20 million, the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir
up interest in ``Super Lotto'' prizes that a decade ago would have
made newspaper front pages.
   ``We are looking for an expanded base of players,'' said Anne
Bloomberg, Ohio Lottery spokeswoman. ``We want the players to
understand that $3 million is a lot of money. While the giant
jackpots get a lot of focus, $150,000 (annual earnings for 20 years
in a $3 million prize) is a lot of money.''
   The explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play
around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by
dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars, said Paul
Dworin, publisher of Gaming and Wagering Business magazine in New
York.
   ``Florida awards a $55 million jackpot, and a lot of people are
not going to get excited by lower numbers,'' Dworin said. ``Why
play when it's $10 million if it could be $50 million?''
   Florida's $55 million prize, awarded after a Sept. 3 drawing, is
the nation's largest lottery jackpot to date. Six of the 10 largest
jackpots have been awarded this year, records show.
   Many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to
trigger ``lotto mania,'' described as the point when sales increase
dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize. In
most ``lotto'' contests, participants try to guess a series of
numbers to be drawn, and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct
match.
   In Illinois, the attitude of players has changed since the state
started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a high-payoff lotto game
in 1983, said Kathy Rem, lottery communication director.
   ``After a lottery has been around a number of years, people get
used to it. Our players have gotten more sophisticated,'' Ms. Rem
said.
   Asked when ``lotto mania'' begins, she added, ``If you wanted a
number, I'd say $20 million.''
   New York recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to
attract upscale, casual players, said Russell Gladieux, acting
director of the New York State Lottery.
   ``We've completely restructured our advertising to get the
person who wouldn't play for $4 million but would play for $20
million,'' Gladieux said. ``We've begun featuring well-dressed,
well-educated, real people who share their dream of winning, on
television.''
   New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine operate a tri-state lotto, but
with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot
of $9.6 million, the contest may never generate ``lotto mania,''
said Rick Wisler, games manager for the New Hampshire Sweepstakes
Commission.
   Blaine Lewis Jr., president of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said newspaper coverage illustrates
how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars.
   ``In 1983, with a $1.4 million winner in Connecticut, we got a
front page story in The Hartford Courant,'' said Lewis, who tracks
lotteries in 28 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands and five Canadian provinces. He said the same
lottery story in 1988 probably wouldn't make the front section of
the newspaper.
   ``People and the press are getting jaded, but most people still
realize a million dollars is a lot of money,'' he said.
   Dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for
lotteries to increase the odds of winning.
   ``If you increase the (choice of numbers), the odds are much
longer and therefore even if more people play, there's a higher
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots,'' Dworin
said.
   In Ohio, where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44, the
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been
$32 million. Ms. Bloomberg said there are several points when sales
increase.
   ``Ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some
casual players come in,'' said Ms. Bloomberg. ``At $13 million to
$15 million, about 80 percent come in.''
   She said once the jackpot exceeds $15 billion, just about
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who
can't by law.
   ``When we get the big jackpots, the attention heightens
visibility, which heightens sales, which heightens the jackpot and
it just keeps going,'' she said.

lottery story in 1988 probably wouldn't make the front section of
the newspaper.
   ``People and the press are getting jaded, but most people still
realize a million dollars is a lot of money,'' he said.
   Dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for
lotteries to increase the odds of winning.
   ``If you increase the (choice of numbers), the odds are much
longer and therefore even if more people play, there's a higher
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots,'' Dworin
said.
   In Ohio, where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44, the
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been
$32 million. Ms. Bloomberg said there are several points when sales
increase.
   ``Ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some
casual players come in,'' said Ms. Bloomberg. ``At $13 million to
$15 million, about 80 percent come in.''
   She said once the jackpot exceeds $15 million, just about
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who
can't by law.
   ``When we get the big jackpots, the attention heightens
visibility, which heightens sales, which heightens the jackpot and
it just keeps going,'' she said.

<HL> REGIONS:
States Hoping to Hit Jackpot
With Big Combined Lottery

   THE BIGGEST get-rich-quick scheme in the history of the Republic, a multistate lottery, is in the works.
Just imagine.
Citizens of New York, Illinois, Oregon and other states competing with each other every week for a single jackpot running as high as $80 million.
Millions of citizens will buy tickets in this, the closest thing yet to a national lottery, and participating states will reap millions of dollars for worthy causes.
All of this, lottery promoters say, is the next best thing to a sure bet.

   Names for the gambling extravaganza are already being tossed around: America's Game and The All-American Game are favorites.
There is an organizing body, the Multistate Lotto Board, headed by Peter O'Connell, Rhode Island's lottery director.
Mr. O'Connell says the game will be running by fall.

   Two hurdles remain.
Many states need approval of their legislatures to participate.
And enough states must sign on to make the enterprise worthwhile.
Odds that each will occur appear good.

   The idea for a nationwide multistate lottery germinated in the Northeast.
Small states there have been restless under the existing lottery system, which operates on two basic principles.
One: The size of a lottery jackpot is determined by the number of people buying tickets.
Two: As jackpots get bigger, more and more people shell out money to play.

   THIS PUTS STATES with small populations at a disadvantage.
Rhode Island's biggest-ever jackpot, $2.2 million, looks puny next to the grand prizes offered twice weekly in neighboring Massachusetts that routinely run $4 million or so.

   Mr. O'Connell says Rhode Islanders regularly play the Massachusetts and Connecticut lotteries, siphoning off sales that would otherwise stay home.
"People will chase a large jackpot," he says.
When New York's lottery was nearing its record $41 million jackpot in August 1985, he adds, "people would get one person and fly him to New York to buy tickets.
They were abandoning the Massachusetts and Rhode Island lotteries and sending money to New York.
That tells you something."

   What it tells small states, Mr. O'Connell thinks, is that they should band together to keep the money at home.
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont fought the attraction of the Massachusetts lottery by joining forces.
Tristate Megabucks, the nation's only regional lottery, has delivered.
The three states, with fewer than three million people, ran up a jackpot of $9.6 million last June.

   Canada is Exhibit B.
The 10 Canadian provinces conduct a combined lottery draw every Wednesday and Saturday.
The four-year-old nationwide lotto game, run by the provinces themselves, is offered in addition to each province's own lottery.

   FEWER PEOPLE now play the lotteries in their own provinces, but this is more than offset by huge sales for the nationwide game.
"If the provincial games in 1982 were at 100, then they're at 80 now, but the total lottery volume is 220," says Guy Simonis, president of British Columbia Lottery Corp.
Since the provinces run both games, they are money ahead.

   Revenue this year in the Canadian interprovincial lottery should approach $2 billion (Canadian).
"This in a country with the population of California," Mr. Simonis notes.

   Small states aren't the only multistate boosters.
John Quinn, director of the New York lottery, says it's smart tactics for his state to join.
If surrounding states that traditionally offer smaller lottery prizes than New York suddenly start offering a piece of the big-buck multistate jackpot, New Yorkers might start crossing state lines to play the multistate game.
"I think we'd be losing some sales," Mr. Quinn says.
But if New York's legislature gives the multistate concept a thumbs up, "there's no doubt in my mind our bottom line will improve."

   HERE'S HOW the game will work: States will sell weekly multistate tickets in addition to their existing lottery games.
The game will be a lotto format, players selecting six numbers from a predetermined field.
Each state will administer its own multistate ticket sales.
If no one has the exact numbers, the prize rolls over and continues to build.
Organizers say they'll cap the jackpot at $80 million, with any extra being used to build the next grand prize.

   The winning numbers will be drawn in Chicago, probably on Saturday night.
States will contribute to the jackpot fund in proportion to the number of tickets they sell.
If Oregon sells 5% of a week's multistate lottery tickets, it kicks in 5% of the jackpot total.

   Michael Jones, a Chicago-based lottery consultant, says the key sections are mostly technical, such as how to ensure uniform payout rules and audit standards.
Putting computer software and drawing equipment in place can be done quickly, he says.

   The list of interested states has shifted in recent weeks.
The hot prospects now are thought to include Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

   Pennsylvania, which claims to offer more lottery games than any state, is on the sidelines.
"We might be adding one too many products," says lottery director Blair Gettig.
"Right now, we don't see the advantage."

   Mr. O'Connell of the lottery board doesn't mind the dissent.
"I'd start with three states -- New York, Illinois and Rhode Island -- but we expect more," he says.
"Once we're up and running, it's only a matter of time before they'll all be trying to join."

<TEXT>
   Residents are wondering whether one of
their neighbors in this town of 14,500 will step forward and claim
the world's largest single lottery jackpot.
   The winning ticket for Florida's $54 million Lotto prize was
bought at one of Longwood's 24 lottery outlets, lottery officials
said.
   Some people are so curious about the winner's identity that
they've flagged down police officers on patrol.
   ``People are really interested,'' said officer Robert Hemmert.
``We're up in the air. We're just as curious as anybody else.''
   Residents may have to wait a while. Last month, it took Emily
Davidheiser 10 days to step forward and identify herself as the
winner of a $26 million jackpot.
   Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. Lottery offices are
closed until Tuesday.
   Although lottery officials can't project the exact payout until
Tuesday, the annual payment to one winner would be about $2.16
million each year after taxes, using a lottery department formula
that divides total winnings by 20 years and deducts 20 percent of
the yearly windfall for taxes.
   Longwood Mayor David Gunter said he was pleased the winning
ticket was bought in his town, once known as the poultry capital of
Florida.
   ``It might put Longwood on the map now,'' he said. ``Whether
they just bought the ticket here or whether they live here, it
means a lot to a community like this.
   ``We're going to take the credit. It feels good.''
   The week's lottery frenzy was a bonanza for promoting the
Florida lottery, which has set numerous sales records in its first
year and attracted worldwide attention.
   The huge jackpot pushed Saturday sales to 14.6 million and total
weekly Lotto purchases to 44.78 million.
   The jackpot for this week's Florida Lotto drawing will begin at
$7 million.
   The Florida jackpot topped the previous record prize for a
numbers game, the $51.4 million shared by two people who bought
winning tickets for California's lottery on June 4.
   Florida's single-ticket win also set a record for the largest
individual Lotto prize, beating the $46 million won on one ticket
in the Pennsylvania lottery in October 1987.

   The St. Petersburg Times had a winning
ticket but no winners in the fledgling Florida lottery's first
computerized numbers game.
   A photo at the top of the front page of Friday morning's
newspaper showed the numbers 8-0-6, which turned out to be the
winning combination in the first Cash 3 contest that night. The
photo, used to illustrate a story about the lottery, was of a
sample ticket sent to the paper a month ago.
   ``This was entirely coincidental,'' City Editor Jack Reed said.
``It doesn't seem like that should need to be said, but we've
gotten so many calls.''
   The first daily contest produced 859 winners but none in the
Times newsroom.
   ``In fact, I don't know anyone that played daily game in the
newsroom,'' Reed said.
   A spokesman for the lottery said the first Cash 3 game drawing
went off without a hitch. Pingpong balls with the winning numbers
were selected in only 60 seconds. The payout totaled $94,090.
   Ticket sales are expected to top $10 million in the first week.
By 7:30 p.m. Friday, $616,543 had been wagered on Cash 3 and
$345,377 on the jackpot Lotto game. Thirty-five percent of all
lottery revenues are earmarked for public education.
   The first Lotto drawing will be held May 7. The prize will be at
least $2 million but could reach $4 million.
   Florida joins 27 other states and the District of Columbia that
have legalized lotteries. Law enforcement officials hope the
legalized Florida numbers games will help undermine illegal numbers
rackets.

<HEAD>Two Players Winner $52 Million Jackpot in Illinois Lottery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Illinois lottery players accomplished what
millions have failed to do in three previous weeks, matching all
six Lotto numbers to capture a grand prize of about $52 million,
the lottery director said Sunday.
   Despite cold weather and blowing snow that caused accidents and
closed roads, ticket sales peaked Saturday afternoon, hours before
the drawing for the second biggest Lotto prize in Illinois history,
Illinois State Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said at a morning news
conference.
   ``We ended up selling nearly $37 million worth of Lotto tickets
in the past week,'' she said. The total revenue collected for
payouts in Saturday's Lotto was more than $72 million, she said.
   The large grand prize and high sales volume followed three
straight rollovers of the Lotto jackpot after no one matched all
six numbers in the drawings of Feb. 3, Feb. 10 and Feb. 17. In its
16-year history, the Illinois lottery has never had a weekly
jackpot roll over four times.
   The previous biggest Illinois jackpot was $69.9 million, divided
by four Lotto players who each matched all six numbers in the
drawing of April 15, 1989.
   The weekend's winning numbers were 25, 31, 35, 36, 39 and 47. As
usual, the winners' identities cannot be confirmed until they step
forward and have their tickets validated by lottery officials.

<HEAD>Despite Burgeoning Popularity, State Lotteries Have Their Critics</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of state lotteries see the games and their burgeoning
popularity due to multimillion-dollar jackpots as a way to increase
government revenue without raising taxes, but critics say the games
are a bad bet for many people.
   In states where lottery revenue goes toward education, the
lottery can stiffen public resistance to paying higher taxes to
support schools, critics say.
   They also say lotteries have no impact on the services they were
designed to finance because the money is used to replace, rather
than supplement, other revenue sources.
   And a long-held argument against lotteries is that they take
money from those who can least afford it.
   Despite the criticism, lottery sales are sizzling.
Multimillion-dollar payouts are so common they hardly make news
anymore.
   In October, California gave away a $61.98 million jackpot, the
world's largest lottery prize ever.
   Lottery ticket sales are expected to reach $14 billion to $15
billion this year, up from $11.4 billion last year.
   And they'll probably rise. Six new state lotteries are opening
this year, and voters in four other states gave the go-ahead on
Election Day for lotteries. Already, 28 states and Washington, D.C.,
have lotteries.
   Of the $11.4 billion, which excludes commissions to ticket
sellers, about $4.8 billion went into state coffers and $6 billion
went back to winners. The rest went for administrative costs,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Some state legislatures
set a percentage of lottery revenue that must go back to the state;
some permit lottery officials to decide the state's cut.
   In five states, lottery revenue is split among several
beneficiaries. In Colorado, half the revenue goes to capital
construction, 40 percent pays for conservation, and 10 percent for
parks and recreation.
   Twelve states put lottery revenue in the state's general fund. In
eight states, lottery money pays for school-related expenses.
   But critics say lottery money has no impact on budgets in most
states.
   ``In many respects it is inappropriate to say that as the lottery
goes up, education spending goes up,'' said Robert H. Koff, dean of
the School of Education at the State University of New York in
Albany.
   J. Blaine Lewis Jr., head of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said it would be a mistake to rely
on lottery revenue to increase expenditures, because lottery sales
fluctuate. ``What if your lottery goes down 5 percent? Then you have
5 percent less than you need,'' he said.
   In some states, educators object to getting money from a lottery
based on ``moral grounds,'' said Illinois School Boards Association
spokesman Jerry Glaub.
   But California educators have a different objection.
   ``I think California educators would be delighted to have the
lottery in place had it not undermined other efforts to increase
funding,'' said James W. Guthrie, a University of California
professor and head of Policy Analysis for California Education, a
private research organization.
   Guthrie conceded that state aid to schools has risen in recent
years. But, he added: ``It's at the local level where school
districts attempt to pass a bond that we run into the perception
that the schools aren't hurting, because of the lottery.''
   ``That is a false perception,'' agreed California lottery
spokeswoman Susan Kossack. ``The lottery provided over $800 million
(in the 1987-88 fiscal year) for education, and that's a lot of
money but it's only 2.5 percent of the public education budget.''
   In Pennsylvania, the lottery pays for programs for the elderly.
   Shirley Sharp, spokeswoman for the American Association for
Retired Persons in Pennsylvania, said it has worked so well that
other constituencies are clamoring for a share.
   Massachusetts has devised a revenue-sharing program in which each
of the state's 351 cities and towns gets a portion of lottery
revenue for discretionary purposes, with the amount based on
population.
   ``People are confident that even if they don't win, there is
still some benefit coming back to their communities,'' said David
Ellis, the state lottery spokesman.
   One of the oldest arguments against raising money through
lotteries is that the games are a regressive tax: People with the
lowest incomes contribute the most money.
   But Ralph Batch of the Public Gaming Research Institute said that
theory ``is not substantiated by 100 surveys.'' Besides, he said,
``when you are buying a lottery ticket on a voluntary basis, it's
not a definition of what I know of as a tax.''

   Lottery players began queuing up today to buy
tickets for next week's state lottery jackpot, which is projected
to top $62 million and will be the second-largest in U.S. history.
   ``We'll just be jammed. We were jammed this morning as soon as
we opened'' at 6:30 a.m., said June Gerken, who sells tickets for
the Super 7 lottery from a balloon shop she operates in Pittsburgh
with her husband, Larry.
   Despite record sales, no ticket sold for Wednesday's drawing
contained seven winning numbers for the jackpot of at least $42
million.
   Lottery officials set next Wednesday's jackpot at $62 million
based on projected ticket sales. The jackpot will be at least that
much and could go higher, spokeswoman Terry Murphy said today.
   The nation's highest lottery jackpot of $69.9 million came just
last week in Illinois. That jackpot was split among four winning
ticket holders after Saturday's drawing. The previous record, set
last fall, was a $61.98 million jackpot split among buyers of three
tickets in the California lottery.
   The largest single winner was a Florida woman who won $55.16
million in that state's lottery in September 1988.
   In the Pennsylvania lottery's ``Super 7'' game, players pick
seven out of 80 numbers. The lottery then picks 11 numbers, and the
winner is anyone whose choices are any seven of the 11 numbers. The
odds of winning are calculated at one in 9.6 million.
   Sally Carpenter, manager of Dunkin Donuts in Woodlyn, said only
a few people have bought tickets this morning for next week's
drawing.
   ``They seem to all wait to the end, and I don't know why,'' she
said.
   ``Most people are in shock. They can't believe it didn't go last
night. They're all excited. They feel they've got another chance,''
said Dorothy DeLuca, who runs the lottery machine at DeLuca's State
News and Variety Store in Erie. ``We have people who don't know how
to play playing.''
   Lottery officials braced for a record number of ticket buyers in
the coming week and advised buyers to use the computer to pick the
numbers, to speed up the sales.
   Lottery official Michael Keyser said a record 29,258,972 tickets
were sold for Wednesday night's drawing, exceeding the previous
number of 27,662,192 on Oct. 14, 1987, when a Hollidaysburg couple
won the previous largest state jackpot of $46 million.

<TEXT>
   A 63-year-old real estate broker,
saying she was middle class ``and the middle class always needs
money,'' stepped forward Wednesday to claim a record world lottery
prize of $55 million.
   The winner, Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, said she watched
Saturday's drawing on television and realized then that she had the
winning ticket.
   ``I just kept saying `Oh, my God,'' she told a room packed with
journalists as she was introduced at the offices of the Florida
Lottery Department.
   Ms. Ryan said she didn't know what she'd do with her winnings,
but didn't think that finding things to do with the wealth would be
a problem. ``I've always been middle class and the middle class
always needs money,'' she said.
   The first of 20 annual installments of $2,767,361 _ less 20
percent withheld for the Internal Revenue Service _ is due to be
paid to Ms. Ryan next week. She said she didn't know if she'd quit
her job.
   The native New Yorker, a single woman with no children who said
her hobbies were tennis and music, moved to central Florida in
1975. She said her relatives include a brother and nephews in New
York.
   She said her Wednesday flight to Tallahassee to present the
winning ticket was her first plane ride.
   ``I've had three firsts today,'' she said. ``It has been my
first plane ride. ... No. 2, this is my first press conference. No.
3, this is the first time I've ever won $55 million.''
   It was Ms. Ryan's third winning ticket in Florida's 8-month-old
lottery _ the other two prizes were for $4 each.
   She picked the first six numbers she came across in various
stories on the front page of The Orlando Sentinel last week and
bought the winning ticket Friday at a grocery store in Longwood,
like Winter Springs a suburb of Orlando. The winning combo was 3,
5, 19, 20, 27, and 35.
   ``These numbers were driving me crazy,'' she said. Ms. Ryan said
she had been buying four tickets a week until Florida offered a $23
million jackpot in early August. Since then, she's been buying five
tickets.
   Before Ms. Ryan claimed her prize, several dozen other people
claimed they had the winning ticket. It's not a crime to claim a
winning lottery ticket, but it's a felony to present an altered
lottery ticket for payment.
   One of the claimants was Charles Hill, an elementary school
janitor in the tiny hamlet of Bristol, about 280 miles northwest of
Longwood.
   Hill's claim was enough to get him a $23,000 Chevrolet van with
no cash down, but Wednesday morning in Tallahassee, he submitted
only a photostat copy of a ticket, saying the original had been
damaged in the laundry.
   ``We have denied Mr. Hill's claim based on the fact he does not
have the original of his ticket,'' said a statement by Tom Bell,
general counsel for the Lottery Department. ``The Lottery's
verification procedures on the copy provided by Mr. Hill indicate
that he does not have the winning ticket.''
   It was not immediately clear whether officials would pursue
charges against Hill, based on his submissal of the photostat
lottery ticket. Bell was in a meeting Wednesday afternoon and not
available for comment, his office said.
   Tommy Thomas, owner of a Panama City Chevrolet dealership, said
he let Hill drive away in a brand new mauve van after Liberty
County Sheriff Harrell W. Revell told his credit manager that
Hill's ticket was genuine.
   ``We're sorry for him, but we're not too shook up about it,''
Thomas said Wednesday afternoon upon learning that Hill wasn't a
winner. He said he expects to get the van back, and joked that
``maybe we'll raffle it off.''
   Several dozen people called the department claiming to have the
winning ticket, according to Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The jackpot's final value was put at $55.16 million. Earlier
estimates put the jackpot at $54 million.
   It was the largest single lottery jackpot in the United States.
   Previously, the largest single jackpot in U.S. history was the
$46 million that went to Donald R. Woomer Sr. and Linda K. Despot,
a couple, of Hollidaysburg, Pa., last October. Two individual
ticket-buyers divided a $51.4 million California lottery jackpot in
June.
   Two other large lottery drawings that were held Saturday night
in New York and Illinois totaled $44 million, bringing the night's
take for the three states to nearly $100 million.
   In New York, $23 million winner Anthony Valentino, 29, of Port
Chester said he would quit his job as a truck driver and his wife,
Connie, said, ``I'd like to see Europe. All of Europe.''
   In Illinois, four ticket-buyers split a $21 million jackpot. As
of Wednesday afternoon, only one of the four had come forward.
Lottery officials identified them as the Kole family of Chicago, a
machine operator, her four children and a cousin, who asked
officials not to give out their full names.

<TEXT>     "Sharon's track record at the Illinois Lottery proves she can do the job
here in California and turn the fortunes of the California Lottery around,"
Wilson said.;   Sharp, who directed the Illinois system from 1987 to 1991,
said she will arrive in California on Wednesday to begin figuring out how to
boost the game's image and income.;   "I've read and studied as much as I can
about the California Lottery, but it's simply premature to say whether I am
going to do this or this or this," Sharp said in a telephone interview from
Illinois. "I am certainly not going to come in with any rosy glow that this is
going to be easy.";   California introduced its lottery in 1985 as a way to
provide added money for schools, which receive about 35 percent of all lottery
revenues.;   Ticket sales rose to a high of $2.6 billion in 1988-'89, bringing
schools an average of $178 per pupil. But sales then tumbled to $2.15 billion
in 1990-'91, and the schools' take slipped to $124 per student.;   This year,
the decline has continued. Total lottery sales from July 1 to Sept. 7 were
only $265 million -- less than three-fourths of what had been expected.;
Legislators, lottery staff members and lottery commissioners have scrambled
for ways to reverse the decline. Some blame the current economic recession or
the gradual loss of the lottery's novelty.;   Others blame changes in the
state's lotto game that made prizes larger while making the already-slim odds
of winning the top jackpot even slimmer -- from one in 14 million to one in 23
million.;   "There is a general perception that nobody wins the lottery and
that the only prizes are $2 prizes," said Chon Gutierrez, whom Sharp will
replace as lottery director. "(Sharp) is going to have to face these
challenges, and face them in an environment where she doesn't have a lot of
control -- a very soft economy.";   Sharp faced similar challenges when she
was chosen to head the Illinois Lottery in 1987. She made numerous changes,
which included altering Illinois' lotto game to give it higher prizes and
slimmer odds -- the same combination that has come under fire in California.;
 Illinois' lottery sales rose under Sharp's tenure, with a 48.6 percent lotto
increase in 1989 and record sums going to schools in 1990.;   Sharp -- who
started a lottery consulting firm when she left the Illinois post earlier this
year -- will earn $95,052 a year. Her appointment requires state Senate
confirmation.  </TEXT>

   Luck Is Running Out at Some Lotteries,
   As Competition and Boredom Take Toll

   Lotteries for years have pushed dreams of easy millions,
both for bettors and the states that sell tickets to
potential fame and fortune. But, like more pedestrian
businesses, state lotteries are beginning to feel the effects
of increased competition and plain old customer boredom.
   Since lotteries were introduced in the mid-1960s, states
have distilled the public's lust for instant riches into a
bonanza for cash-strapped coffers. Lottomania has swept 33
states and the District of Columbia, pumping more than $7
billion into education, senior citizens' programs and other
causes last year alone. Estimated 1990 sales rose to a record
$20 billion, although the approximate 6% increase was the
smallest since 1987 and resulted largely from new states
starting games.

   While new lotteries usually enjoy robust double-digit
growth for a while, the real trick is producing steady growth
once the novelty wears off. "There are people who think
lotteries are in a world by themselves, but they're not
immune to the laws of the marketplace," says Saul F. Leonard,
a gambling industry consultant in Los Angeles who works with
state lotteries. And lottery officials, who are looking for
new games and technologies that can produce solid long-term
growth, warn that there aren't any quick fixes.
   In the short term, many lottery officials say the
recession is chipping away at customers' discretionary
spending, debunking the old myth that gambling is
recessionproof. While executives say it's difficult to know
just how damaging the recession will be, it's clearly
affecting lottery sales in New York and a number of other
states.
   Although lotteries are a form of gambling, they compete
directly with movies, video rentals and other discretionary
purchases for the consumer's entertainment dollar. The
expansion of riverboat gambling, Indian bingo, off-track
betting and other forms of gambling may also hurt.
   "Lottery growth is continuing, but in many cases it's not
meeting expectations," says William S. Bergman, executive
director of the North American Association of State and
Provincial Lotteries. While new lotteries are continuing to
do well, he says, "for the more mature lotteries, especially
those in the Northeast and the Rust Belt, things are
softening a bit."
   Total sales in California dropped to $2.47 billion in the
year ended June 30 from $2.62 billion the prior year,
although lottery officials say the decline has leveled off
since last summer. Iowa's sales dropped about 2% to $169.5
million last year, while such other states as Pennsylvania
have also shown declines in the past year.
   In several states, lotto game sales are declining, but the
drop is being offset somewhat by increases in other games.
Peter D. Lynch, director of the New York lottery, thinks
higher gasoline prices are a prime suspect in the sharp
falloff of state lotto sales since last summer. "Someone who
spent $15 to fill up the gasoline tank and $5 in lottery
tickets is now spending $22 to fill up the tank," Mr. Lynch
says. Lotto sales have dropped 8% since last summer, he
estimates.
   The problems affecting the New York lottery, long
considered one of the nation's most successful, are typical
of those bedeviling mature lotteries. Tight-fisted state
officials slashed the lottery's ad budget 40% this fiscal
year. A special promotion in January produced a spectacular
$90 million jackpot, and officials hoped it would pump up
sales by grabbing big headlines. But hardly a word appeared
in the press because of coverage of the war. Nonetheless, Mr.
Lynch expects sales to hit $2.1 billion this year, up from
$1.92 billion in the year ended March 31.
   Bigger jackpots alone no longer guarantee player interest,
experts say. And serious gamblers have always argued that
lotteries are a lousy bet: The odds of picking the correct
six of 53 numbers, for example, are a staggering 23 million
to one. Many lotteries operate under guidelines similar to
those governing California's lottery, which allocates at
least 34% of sales to public schools, 50% to players and a
maximum of 16% to retailer commissions and other expenses.
   Given those odds, many lotteries are shifting their
pitches from "become an instant millionaire" to the fun of
playing. "We stress winning too much," says Jim Davey,
director of the Oregon lottery and president of Lotto
America, a lottery game that is played in several smaller
states. "We haven't done a good job in positioning it as
entertainment."
   The Oregon lottery was a pioneer in a new generation of
lottery games when it started the nation's first sports pool
games last year. The games fell short of expectations, and
faced formidable opposition from the National Football League
and the National Basketball Association, which are fighting
in Congress and individual states to block lottery sports
betting.
   Many experts believe sports games could help lottery
growth, but most say new technologies hold greater promise.
South Dakota is among the first to try video lottery
terminals, which offer instant results and have proved
popular with players. But many lottery directors worry about
a public outcry over video terminals, which some might think
blur the line between traditional lotto and "hard" gambling.
   The format that may hold the greatest potential -- and
faces the biggest hurdles -- is an interactive telephone
lottery. A group of lottery directors is exploring a
multi-state lottery that would let players gain access to the
game from their telephones. A television show tie-in would
provide the excitement and "player engagement" that makes
casino gambling so popular.
   "Phone interactive is one of a very, very few remaining
big-time events for lotteries," says Sharon Sharp, director
of the $1.6 billion Illinois lottery and a leading proponent
of the game. Mrs. Sharp acknowledges that political
opposition could be formidable but notes that lotteries are
by their nature controversial.
   Chon Gutierrez, who oversees the nation's biggest lottery
in California, believes the key to growth isn't in new games
but in making lotteries more accessible to players. "The key
to the future of the lottery is in broadening the player
base," Mr. Gutierrez says. "We have to minimize the hurdles
that force the occasional player to go out of his way to
play."
   Despite the slowdown in lottery growth, the games seem
certain to spread. Resistance to lotteries has succumbed to a
need for revenue even in such conservative states as
Louisiana, and experts bet that other Bible Belt states and
Texas won't be far behind. "When their financial situation
becomes stressful enough, you'll see gambling come through,"
says Mr. Leonard.
   In fact, lottery officials say, some cities are looking at
lotteries as a possible way of stemming their own flood of
red ink, either by tapping into their state's lottery or
starting up a separate municipal game, a move likely to meet
heated opposition from state games. New York City considered
a 25-cent surcharge on ticket sales and even wanted to start
its own scratchoff lottery game, but the Legislature didn't
approve them. Industry experts say the issues are bound to
recur as fiscal crises deepen around the nation.
   As lotteries enter their next phase, some worry that
states may seek a higher payoff for themselves. "Expectations
are so high," says Illinois's Mrs. Sharp. "But if we see
states get too greedy for lottery dollars, it can hurt."
Increasingly, lotteries find themselves stuck in the
political crossfire among legislatures, constituents and
state leaders as they search for cash cows to supplement
shrinking tax bases.
   Mr. Lynch of the New York lottery says the current
slowdown in lottery growth proves clearly that "there's a
limit to the public's discretionary spending on all forms of
entertainment, and lotteries in particular." But considering
the huge "gray market" for such activities as video poker
machines, he adds, "there's still plenty of room for
lotteries to grow without reaching a saturation point."

<HL> Control Data Is Big Loser In Florida Lottery So Far --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>

<TEXT>
   For Control Data Corp., the new Florida lottery has been a loser.
It already has cost the company more than $2 million.

   The Minneapolis-based computer-services concern recently won the rights to install the Florida system, and made a big deal of it in its annual report to shareholders.
It estimated potential revenue from the contract at more than $100 million.

   But when the computerized wagering system went on-line April 29, some of the 3,147 terminals installed didn't work.
"They'd be up, they'd be down, they were erratic," said Jon Peck, press secretary to Florida Gov. Bob Martinez.
"It led to a lot of confusion and dismay among those who wanted to play the games."

   As a result, the company, which has lottery contracts in six other states, agreed to forgo its first $1,460,000 payment from Florida.
Moreover, Control Data will pay the state $100,000 a month for the first half of 1989, and will throw in three new computer systems for Florida schools.

   Calling it a "glitch," a Control Data spokesman blamed some of the problem on difficulties "that always come up in dealing with the phone company and lead times."
The spokesman said that unlike other lottery contracts, Control Data had assumed responsibility for communications links between game-controlling computers and terminals scattered across the state.

<HEAD>Lottery Awards $3 Million to Janitor Who Lost Winning 1985 Ticket</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A janitor who lost his winning ticket for a $3
million lottery says he's not mad that it took him four years to
claim the prize.
   ``The lottery was doing their job,'' said newly-made millionaire
Julius Russell Jr. The school janitor from the South Side picked up
a certificate of his winnings from lottery officials Thursday. ``Why
should I feel resentment?''
   Russell, 60, matched all six winning Lotto numbers in a November
1985 drawing, but accidently threw away his ticket.
   He proved in court last month that he consistently played the
same two sets of numbers in the weekly Lotto game, and the lottery
confirmed that one of two winning tickets for the $6 million jackpot
was purchased at the grocery where Russell routinely plays the game.
   The Illinois State Lottery had argued that lottery rules require
possession of a ticket to win, and officials appealed the court
ruling.
   But Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday the agency was
withdrawing its appeal after a check of lottery records showed
prizes have been awarded previously to claimants who could not
produce a winning ticket. None of the prizes was for more than
$5,000.
   ``We thought Mr. Russell should not have to suffer,'' she said.
   Ms. Sharp presented Russell with a mock check, and said he would
receive three installments of about $450,000 within eight weeks. The
remainder will be paid in 17 annual installments, she said.
   ``I feel great. I have five beautiful daughters and that's where
it's going,'' Russell said. ``I haven't thought about myself as of
yet.''
   Circuit Judge Robert Sklowdowski ruled Aug. 10 that the lottery
must pay Russell the prize despite his inability to produce the
winning ticket.
   ``I have decided that paying this particular claimant is the
fairest way to resolve this case,'' Ms. Sharp said. ``We think he
deserves the $3 million.''
   Ms. Sharp said lottery officials would never again pay a claim
without a ticket, and would seek legislation to toughen the ``no
ticket, no win'' rule.
   Russell said he plans to keep his job.
   The Illinois State Lottery has $14 million in unclaimed prizes,
Ms. Sharp said, and ``a lot'' of people make claims without tickets.
   Ms. Sharp said only one other state, Ohio, had awarded a grand
prize without a ticket.

   A woman who says she ``fussed at my
husband every time he bought some tickets'' was among the winners
to step forward today and claim their share of a record $106.5
million jackpot.
   Six Florida Lottery tickets matched the winning numbers drawn
Saturday night after a week of feverish buying, some of it by
people who drove or flew in from out of state or plunked down
thousands of dollars trying to improve their odds from 1 in 14
million. Two of the winners appeared at a news conference this
morning.
   Jeanne Piasecki of New Smyrna Beach said her family was
splitting the winnings. She added smilingly: ``I still don't
believe in gambling. I fussed at my husband every time he bought
some tickets.''
   Another winning ticket holder, Pat Landry of Sorrento in Lake
County, said her winning entry, bought by her daughter in Longwood,
was divided among a dozen family members and friends.
   She said she was glad their were six grand prize winners because
it helped keep the attention on her family to a minimum.
   ``Who needs $106 million?'' she commented.
   Both ticket winners said the numbers were picked at random.
   The jackpot, estimated at $105 million Sunday, was calculated
today at $106.5 million - a state record and second largest in U.S.
history. Each of the six tickets is thus worth $17.75 million over
20 years, or about $887,500 a year before taxes.
   The other four winners didn't immediately step forward. Lottery
computers show the other winning tickets were bought in Miami,
Coconut Creek, Venice and Winter Haven.
   The winners matched all six numbers drawn: 05-06-21-34-35-45.
   Some of the umpteen million losers had plenty to say, too.
   ``I just lost miserably,'' said Victor Morgan, who bought two
tickets. ``But I've wasted my money on worse things.''
   Jennifer Kram, who matched just three numbers on one of her 20
tickets, said, ``I'm very depressed. Three isn't good enough for
me. I wanted at least $500,000.'' The three-number match will bring
her a grand total of $5.50.
   The prize had snowballed for four weeks, growing with each
week's drawing every time no one won the jackpot. Only a $115
million jackpot in Pennsylvania last year has been higher. But in
that drawing, 14 winning tickets were sold.
   More than 100 million $1 tickets were sold, at up to 44,500 a
minute.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul hinted at the exhaustion the week
had brought.
   ``I think we're glad it's over,'' she said. ``But it's been fun
and exciting.''
   State economists planned to meet today to calculate how much
extra money education will reap. Education, like the rest of state
government, is facing a 5 percent spending cutback because of a
shortfall in revenue.
   By law, half of every dollar spent on a Florida lottery ticket
is paid out in prizes. At least 38.5 percent goes to education, and
the rest to retailers and administration.
   The U.S. record for a lottery prize to a single winner is held
by Florida, which awarded a woman almost $55.2 million after a
drawing two years ago.

   One lucky Lotto player received a Christmas Eve
gift that will go on giving for many Christmases to come _ $37
million spread out in 20 annual payments, state lottery officials
said Sunday.
   But the identity of the winner of the third largest grand prize
ever awarded in the Illinois lottery could remain a mystery for a
day or two, said lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem. State officials have
to certify the winning ticket, and they don't go back to work until
Tuesday, Ms. Rem said.
   The huge payout is the result of three previous weekend drawings
without any player matching all six numbers drawn from among 54
possible. The state lottery guarantees $5 million for each weekend
drawing and rolls that amount over.
   Strong ticket sales added an extra $17 million to the pot to push
the total to $37 million, Ms. Rem said.
   The prize is the fifth largest ever in the United States to go to
a single ticket buyer. The biggest winner is Sheelah Ryan of Winter
Springs, Fla., who won $55.16 million in the Florida lottery in
September.
   Former printer Mike Wittkowski won the largest-ever Illinois
lottery prize of $40 million four years ago.
   Saturday's winning numbers were eight, nine, 27, 33, 43 and 54.
   In addition to the one big winner, 539 players correctly matched
five of six numbers to win $2,365 each, and nearly 32,000 players
matched four to win $80, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A projected $55 million-plus lottery
prize that would return the North American title for big jackpots to
the state is making Californians' gambling fever rise again.
   Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for the
Saturday drawing were running about double the usual pace for
Thursday's sales.
   The official estimate of ``over $55 million'' for the drawing is
conservative, based on similar situations in the two-year history of
California's computerized Lotto 6-49 game, said lottery spokesman
Bob Taylor.
   On June 4, California's lottery paid out a $51.4 million jackpot,
North America's largest at the time. That jackpot was eclipsed Sept.
3 by a $55.1 million prize in Florida.
   The state-run lottery's policy is to estimate the jackpot
conservatively, then revise the projection upward as sales soar.
   It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the
1-in-14-million chance of winning the jackpot.
   ``The jackpot is going to generate an awful lot of sales,'' said
Taylor.
   The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers,
which combine to produce heavy gambling periods, dubbed
``lottomania'' when they first struck other state's games.
   When nobody picks all six winning numbers out of a choice 49, the
jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for the next
twice-weekly drawing.
   Four rollovers, including the rollover of a $33.4 million jackpot
Wednesday night, produced the current record prize estimate.
   The exact size of the jackpot will depend on how many tickets are
sold. Of every $1 ticket, 20 cents goes into the jackpot.
   Each time the jackpot climbs, so do sales, pushing the total
still higher, generating even more sales. Historically, most of the
sales occur in the last few hours before the televised drawing at
four seconds before 7:57 p.m. Sales are cut off at 7:45 p.m.
   By 2 p.m. Thursday, sales hit $1.2 million, which is normally the
total for the entire 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. sales period on a Thursday,
said Taylor.

<TEXT>
   Members of two farflung families came forward
from four states Monday to claim half the record $69.9 million
Illinois Lotto jackpot, leaving the holders of the two other
winning tickets unknown.
   ``It's more money than any of us ever expected to see in our
lifetimes,'' said Daniel Dixon, 38, of suburban Naperville, Ill..,
who bought one winning ticket for his wife's family.
   Louis and Mary Matlosz, of Elizabeth, N.J., and their four
children, including Dixon's wife MaryAnn, and three grandchildren,
joined Dixon at a news conference, saying they would split their
$17.5 million share of the jackpot and plan to spend the money on
vacations and on the grandchildren.
   Another winner was Ron Miller, 36, a hog buyer from Little York,
who will share his prize with brothers in Stafford, Texas, and
Chandler, Ariz.
   Miller said he was ``hysterical,'' after learning he had won.
``I sat at the table and laughed.''
   The news got around fast in Little York, a town of 300 in
west-central Illinois, and a big sign in the Post Office declared
``Congratulations, Ron.''
   State computers recorded that four winning tickets were sold _
two in the Chicago area, one in west-central Illinois and one in
southern Illinois.
   Both the Matlosz family and the Miller family bought 15 Lotto
tickets, and Miller said he was not surprised the $69.9 million
jackpot was being shared.
   ``It's more money than I'll ever use,'' Miller said.
   He said he would not quit work altogether, but ``I'll find
something I like a little better.''
   The Matlosz family members planned to keep working.
   The remaining winners were expected to come forward this week,
perhaps after making financial preparations.
   ``Most people will have already gotten some advice,'' said state
Lottery Director Sharon Sharp.
   The final figure for the jackpot, boosted by four winner-less
drawings and a frenzy of ticket-buying last week before Saturday's
drawing, was $69,940,000, Ms. Sharp said.
   The huge jackpot, which nearly doubled in the week before the
drawing, drew dreamers to Lotto outlets from around the country and
even the world, as travelers flocked to Lotto kiosks at O'Hare
International Airport between planes.
   By Monday, life was back to normal in Lotto-land. ``It's a lot
slower than last week,'' Ms. Sharp said.
   The jackpot, bolstered by a week of record sales, beat the world
record of $61.98 million set in October in California. That pot was
split among three winning tickets, one bought by an individual and
the others bought by groups of co-workers.
   If only one person had matched the numbers, the jackpot would
have been the largest paid to a single winner. But with four
ticket-holders sharing the pot, the largest single winner in U.S.
history remains a Florida woman who walked away with $55.16 million
in the Florida lottery in September.
   The winning numbers drawn Saturday were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54.
   Illinois Lotto players pick six numbers from 1 to 54 with two
chances on each $1 ticket. The odds that a ticket carries a winning
sequence are 12.9 million to 1.
