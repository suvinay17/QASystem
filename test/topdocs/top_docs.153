FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (6): Creature
from outer space - Profile of SCI of Huntsville, Alabama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the fruits of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(Nasa) programme in the 1960s was that it spawned a new generation of
innovative electronics companies.
One is SCI, founded in Alabama by Olin B King, a former Nasa engineer who
began a three-man business manufacturing flight simulators for the moon
shots in his basement in 1961.
King realised, however, that there was not much volume in 18 moon shots. So
he diversified the company, initially called Space Craft Inc., into building
a wide range of electronic systems under contract.
By 1969, when the Apollo launch vehicle left the Kennedy Space centre launch
pad, it was carrying more than 400 SCI-built sub-systems providing vital
instrumentation, communication and computer functions, including some in the
lunar lander.
Eight years later, in August 1977, SCI built the plated-wire memories for
the highly successful Voyager 2 spacecraft whose systems were still
operating flawlessly more than a decade later.
When the original IBM PC made its appearance in 1981 it came with a
SCI-manufactured motherboard. SCI also manufactured the Sinclair-designed
Z88 computer.
By the mid 1980s SCI had become a Fortune 500 company in its own right.
Today it is one of the biggest and oldest contract electronics manufacturers
employing about 9,500 people in 19 manufacturing plants worldwide, and
serving mainly multinational customers in North America, Western Europe and
South East Asia where it has plants in Singapore and Thailand. Last year,
the publicly-quoted group, which is still based at Huntsville, reported net
income of Dollars 3.83m on revenues of Dollars 1.05bn despite the recession.
SCI's major worldwide IT customers in the year to June 30 last year included
IBM, Seagate Technology and Conner Peripherals, which together accounted for
almost half its total revenues. However, SCI is now a major diversified
manufacturer for both the Government and commercial markets. It designs,
manufactures, markets and services electronic products for OEM (original
equipment manufacturers) customers in many industries including the
aerospace, telecommunications, medical and banking sectors.
Its investment in electronics manufacturing technology is enormous. Overall
the group, which began to install surface mount technology (SMT) production
lines in 1985, had 75 fully automated SMT assembly lines in operation by mid
1992 together with 34 traditional lines using the older PTH
(plated-through-hole) technology.
The group is divided into five geographic regions each with multiple plants
manufacturing components, sub-assemblies and finished products for
customers, but also increasingly offering a full 'turnkey' option including
design, engineering, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and support
services if required.
The growth of SCI's international operations, including those in Europe,
directly reflects the increasing globalisation of the world electronics
industry. SCI followed its OEM customers overseas in order to maintain its
global manufacturing relationships.
For example, SCI's European region comprises two manufacturing facilities,
one in Irvine, Scotland, and the other in Fermoy, County Cork,in the Irish
Republic.
Both sites reflect the establishment of significant offshore manufacturing
bases by global OEMs over the past decade. In Scotland, SCI followed
customers such as IBM, Sun Micro systems and Mitsubishi which needed to
establish operations in Europe and were attracted to the region by a range
of incentives.
Similarly the Fermoy plant, which employs 300 people, was set up in 1989 to
provide electronic assemblies to Irish manufacturing operations of
multinational OEMs such as Dell Computer which set up operations in Ireland
as part of their global manufacturing strategies.
'They all want to manufacture close to the market because it gives
flexibility,' says Mr Bruce Armstrong, SCI senior vice president in charge
of the European division.
SCI's size and dispersed operations are a significant advantage when dealing
with large multinational OEMs because it can offer customers considerable
flexibility. If a customer's market or manufacturing need changes by
location or demand, production can be switched to any SCI plant in a matter
of days.
For example, a complete new SMT line can be flown in from Huntsville and,
says Armstrong, 'be up and running within two weeks'. Because modern
contract manufacturing is capital intensive the cost differential between
different regions is not usually significant. 'These days the cost is a
given, but it is flexibility that counts,' when it comes to holding on to
customers, he says.
Nevertheless he accepts that the European plants have to be able to match
the Far East on the basis of 'landed' or total contract price - including
those costs which are often overlooked such as transport, inventory and
other less tangible items such as delays and inflexibility.
It is a measure of the success at Irvine in controlling overheads and other
costs while providing flexibility that it has recently succeeded in winning
some contracts back from the Far East.
The 120,000 sq ft Scottish plant was set up in 1984, mainly to supply IBM's
Greenock PC operations. Today it employs about 800 people although, like
most other large contract electronics manufacturers, SCI also uses a pool of
casual labour and the workforce is expanded by several hundred temporary
workers at busy times.
Equipment at Irvine includes 12 Fuji SMT lines, each costing about Dollars
1m, four Universal PTH lines and three system configuration lines. Currently
80 per cent of output is SMT, 15 per cent PTH and 5 per cent even newer
technologies such as COB (chip on board). But by the turn of the century Mr
Armstrong expects the proportions to be 75 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per
cent respectively.
The product mix is also changing. Five years ago 90 per cent of production
was for the IT industry. However the plant has broadened its customer base.
IT now represents about 70 per cent, telecommunications 20 per cent and
automotive 10 per cent with telecoms and the automotive sectors growing
rapidly.
SCI has also expanded its range of services and increasingly sees itself as
being in a beneficial partnership with its customers. Some customers still
only require a consignment manufacturing service - they supply all the
materials. However, Mr Armstrong says the 'more enlightened' OEMs have long
since moved towards much broader 'turnkey' contracts where services can
range from product engineering and design for manufacturing, through
procurement, manufacturing and testing to distribution.
SCI designs and manufactures some products completely. For example, it
designs and builds its own PCs, which are then badged by two big computer
companies. Mr Armstrong acknowledges that there is some temptation for SCI
to widen its business and sell products under its own name. However, he
adds, 'in the end it's about doing what you are good at'. And for SCI that
is being expert at capital intensive, high technology, flexible contract
manufacturing.
In order to maximise flexibility while minimising costs SCI uses automated
manufacturing systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) to provide
sophisticated links with its customers and suppliers and to interconnect its
own plants.
'The reason we are efficient is that each plant is a profit and loss centre.
They have to make a profit,' says Mr Armstrong. The two European plants
export 50 per cent of their production to continental Europe, and the
percentage is rising so SCI is likely to build a new plant in Europe soon,
probably in France.
When any of its plants reaches full capacity SCI builds another rather than
expanding existing facilities. This is because it believes that overheads
increase quickly when a plant becomes too large. 'Otherwise you become an
OEM,' says Mr Armstrong. 'In our business small and medium is beautiful.'

<TEXT>
   Convergent Technologies Inc., battered by slumping margins in its core computer business and high marketing costs for new products, posted a first-quarter loss of $11 million.
The company previously had forecast a loss of at least $9.6 million.

   In the 1986 first quarter, Convergent had a restated net income of $2.1 million, or five cents a share.
Revenue for the 1987 quarter fell 5% to $73.6 million from $77.4 million in the year-earlier period.

   It was the fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the computer and software maker, whose troubles began more than a year ago, when it lost most of a contract to supply computer systems to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for resale by AT&amp;T under the UNIX-PC label.

   Paul C. Ely Jr., Convergent's chairman, called the first-quarter results "a disappointing detour on our path to bring Convergent stability and profitability."
A company spokesman, however, said Convergent is counting on a general improvement in its marketing niche -- original equipment manufacturing -- and a rebound in its growing applications-software business to return it to profitability by year's end.

   Analysts agreed that margins in Convergent's highly competitive market are likely to improve over the next several quarters and said the company's frustrations in achieving its revenue goals in its relatively new software business, operated by its Convergent Business Systems unit, aren't unusual in new ventures.

   Stephen K. Smith, an analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc., said, however, that a critical question is whether Convergent, given its marketing niche's volatility, has "the cost controls in place to manage a business that's changing dramatically."

   Convergent's first-quarter results reflect a sharp deterioration in original equipment manufacturing margins after several quarters of recovery, according to Mr. Smith.
He blamed erosion of margins on price pressures in the personal computer business and escalating costs of certain parts.

   Of its 1987 first-quarter revenues, Convergent said $20.4 million, or 28%, came from recent acquisitions within its Convergent Business Systems unit, which markets turnkey applications-software systems for small businesses.
The contribution of the unit, owing to seasonal slowdowns for certain products and lower-than-anticipated sales of certain new software programs, fell below expectations, Convergent said.

   A company spokesman, however, said results of the unit are expected to rebound in the second and third quarters.
Success of the unit is considered key to Convergent's efforts to wean itself from complete dependency on original equipment manufacturing contracts.

<HL> Convergent Technologies Inc. Posts Loss
Of $4.5 Million for the Fourth Quarter

<TEXT>
   Convergent Technologies Inc., still woozy from losing most of a large original-equipment manufacturing contract with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., reported a narrower fourth-quarter loss.

   The computer and software concern's $4.5 million loss, which compares with a loss of $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter, resulted from nonrecurring charges totaling $4.9 million.
Without the charges, the company would have shown a small profit, which is what industry analysts had expected.

   The fourth-quarter one-time charges include $2.9 million from the donation of several hundred computer systems to U.S. colleges and universities, $400,000 from the closing of the company's Japanese subsidiary, and $1.6 million from the consolidation of certain leased facilities.

   Convergent's chairman and chief executive officer, Paul C. Ely, is "taking the opportunity to clean house, or they would have done a little better than break even," said Richard Edwards, a computer industry analyst with Robertson, Coleman &amp; Stephens in San Francisco.

   The Milpitas, Calif.-based company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 35% to $77.4 million from $118.8 million a year earlier.

   Convergent is struggling to wean itself from its dwindling original-equipment relationship with AT&amp;T, whose UNIX-PC microcomputer, manufactured by Convergent, has flopped in the marketplace.

   The company's shipments to AT&amp;T have declined from a peak of $48 million during the fourth-quarter of 1985, to $7 million in the quarter just ended, according to Stephen K. Smith, analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. Mr. Smith expects Convergent's AT&amp;T shipments to be "just a trickle" in 1987.

   Under Mr. Ely, who became chief executive in early 1985, Convergent has embarked on a new strategy to create what it calls a "federation" of software companies specializing in applications for small businesses.

   Mr. Smith said Convergent's software activities, including subsidiaries serving auto dealerships, beverage distributorships and lumber yards, currently account for about a third of the company's revenue, with the remainder coming from Convergent's traditional original-equipment, or OEM, computer businesses.

   "The problem is their OEM business isn't profitable," said Mr. Smith.
"They need to do about $65 million in OEM to break even, and they only did $51 million last quarter."

   On the upside, analysts say, Convergent may benefit in coming months from many users of some of its roughly 250,000 currently installed systems, who may trade up to the new, more powerful 80386 microprocessor made by Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp.

   Unlike most other personal computers, Convergent's systems contain modules that allow users to upgrade their systems when new chips become available.
"To some extent, they have a captive market already out there," said Mr. Smith.

   For the full year, the company had a loss of $32.8 million, compared with earnings of $13.2 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier.
The company's 1986 revenue declined 33% to $305.8 million from $459.3 million last year.

second-quarter loss that will "significantly exceed" its $7
million loss in the first quarter, said it would move to exit
an unprofitable sales operation that once accounted for
one-third of its revenue.
   The Beaverton, Ore., maker of high-powered computing
systems also announced it would dismiss 7% to 9% of its
world-wide work force of about 1,700 people, freeze salaries,
reduce travel and severely restrict capital purchases.

   The company cited the recession and a sharp decline in
so-called original equipment manufacturer sales in projecting
the loss for the quarter ended June 29, which it said will
widen significantly from the first quarter's 30 cents a
share. Original equipment manufacturer sales, which the
company says it will now de-emphasize, refer to sales to
customers that resell Sequent products under their own label.
   Revenue is expected to be $49 million to $51 million, up
from $47.9 million in the first quarter but down from $58.2
million in the year-ago second quarter, when Sequent reported
net income of $5.7 million, or 24 cents a share.
   Second-quarter results are expected to be released July
23. The company said the projected loss includes a one-time
charge for costs related to the work-force reduction.
   Minus the charge, analysts said that equates to an
operating loss of $5 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a
share; higher than analysts' estimates that the operating
loss would be 10 cents a share for the period.
   Following the announcement, Sequent stock fell $2 to close
at $9.75 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   Scott Gibson, Sequent president, said the quarter was
particularly frustrating because the company's sales to
end-user customers grew 20% from the first quarter while
orders to vendors who resell under their own label fell 50%.
   The original equipment manufacturer sales were stagnant
for much of 1990 and have been declining since December,
primarily because of financial problems experienced by
Sequent's largest customer, Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa., the
company said.
   After agreeing to supply computer systems to Unisys in
early 1989, Sequent's resell orders grew that year to $50
million, or 34% of its business, but were projected to
decline this year to $34 million, or 13% of its business,
with another decrease expected in 1992, analysts said. The
company, therefore, said it decided to de-emphasize that
business, while shifting focus to the more lucrative end-user
sales.
   "We will not be pursuing any new business {in orders for
resale}," Mr. Gibson said, adding that the company isn't
cancelling contracts with Unisys and its other big customer,
Siemens Nixdorf Inc. in Germany.
   The move drew praise from analysts. "If it's a drain on
the expenses and you can't reverse a negative trend, it seems
like you might as well cut your losses," said John B. Jones,
managing director of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   Analyst J. Neil Weintraut with Hambrecht &amp; Quist said
that, long-term, Sequent's exiting the resale business would
help restore profitability. "But the company still has to get
its financial results back on a strong footing, which will
likely take into the fourth quarter," he said, citing the
continued weak economy, among other factors.

   Convergent Technologies Inc. said it expects to report a first-quarter loss that is more than double the $4.8 million loss it incurred in the fourth quarter of 1986.

   In the 1986 first quarter, the computer manufacturer posted profit of $1.9 million, or five cents a share, on sales of $73.5 million.

   Convergent blamed the anticipated deficit on lower-than-expected operating margins, start-up costs for new product manufacturing, and increased expenses.

   Company officials did not elaborate on the anticipated loss.

   Results declined both in the company's traditional business of selling to original equipment manufacturers and in Convergent Business Systems, a federation of companies providing computer solutions directly to users.

   However, positive trends in the booking of new orders should help Convergent correct its margin problems, said the company's chairman, Paul C. Ely Jr.

<F P=106> [Interview with Amaury Halna du Fretay, President of the </F>
GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Group] Equipment Group, by
Jean Dupont; place and date not given: "`The Year 1994 Will Be
Still More Difficult Than Last Year'"]
  [Text]
  [Dupont] Your branch seems to have been relatively spared in
the 1994 defense budget. Would you say that it will help you
maintain employment at equipment manufacturers?
  [Halna du Fretay] As you just said, the 1994 budget shows a
slight upturn. Unfortunately, it comes after several years when
it was reduced in current francs. It is a good sign; it shows
that the government is aware that the situation of our industry
had become tragically inadequate. For all that, this budget will
not enable us to solve all employment problems. Our current
activity also depends on previous years' budget commitments. Our
feeling is that the year 1994 will be still more difficult than
last year. There will be still more layoffs, more employment
adjustment plans, and probably more companies filing for
bankruptcy. I would like to add that the difficulties raised
against our prime contractors concerning the implementation of
employment adjustment plans constitute an incentive for them to
take back some activities and subcontracting. In other words,
you prevent layoffs in one place and you create them in another.
All we can say is that things will not get as much worse in
1994, with a defense equipment budget of 130 billion francs
[Fr], as would have been the case if the budget had remained at
Fr97 billion like last year.
  [Dupont] Each new program increases self-financing by
manufacturers, in particular equipment manufacturers. Do you
feel that you are in a position to make the effort required?
  [Halna du Fretay] For many French equipment manufacturers,
the need to provide additional co-financing while sales and
series production are decreasing and margins getting smaller
forces them to operate in the red or on the verge of it. For the
NH-90 program, the financing required of equipment manufacturers
represents 40 to 100 percent of design and engineering costs.
All equipment manufacturers are eager to compete for this
program, especially because there are not that many new
programs. But some will be unable to keep up with the
self-financing levels currently considered. In addition, with
NH-90 we have the quite abnormal situation of a military program
which may or may not go on to series production. On the other
hand, the U.S. government pays for 100 percent of military
research and development!
  [Dupont] With declining deliveries of new aircraft, fleets
throughout the world are aging. What are French equipment
manufacturers doing to seize the opportunities that may arise in
customer service and modernization?
  [Halna du Fretay] We can say today that French equipment
manufacturers have reached the level of their U.S. competitors
as far as customer service quality is concerned. Besides, since
the beginning of this decade, the Airbus inventory represents a
significant part of the world fleet, which now provides us with
a solid base for customer service.
  As far as spare parts for older aircraft are concerned, our
competitors are the "brokers" and we must be at least as good as
they are; which means that we must offer airlines close-by
servicing facilities, just as they do. For new-generation
aircraft, we must increasingly be able to offer overall service
in the form of maintenance agreements based on flight-time, the
goal being to free airlines from the burden of maintaining spare
parts inventories. The same trend can also be observed on export
military markets, where equipment manufacturers are increasingly
required to provide these services. That is an additional effort
that we must make.
  In another respect, fleet aging does create an emerging
market among airlines, to improve the operational capacities, in
particular landing, and the operating costs of their older
aircraft. As for the modernization of military aircraft, the
French are already quite well represented on these markets. But
this will never amount to much and it will not replace domestic
original-equipment markets.
  [Dupont] The crisis in the aircraft manufacturing industry
hit equipment manufacturers before it hit prime contractors.
Will the recovery also be felt first at equipment manufacturers?
  [Halna du Fretay] The crisis hit equipment manufacturers
before prime contractors because spare part markets collapsed
and original-equipment inventories were reduced, or because
prime contractors took back some activities. It is very
difficult to make a forecast as to the recovery of spare parts
markets. But if prime contractors have actually depleted their
intermediate product inventories, then I agree that recovery
might be stronger for us and pose rather difficult problems. In
some cases, we may even find that suppliers cannot cope because
they have reduced their activities so much that it will take
them a very long time to bring back their capacities to
pre-crisis levels.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: T&amp;N raises Pounds 37m for purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the motor component manufacturer, yesterday successfully placed 21.9m
shares at 170p to raise Pounds 37m to help finance the acquisition of Goetze
AG, the German piston ring producer.
The deal, announced in principle last year, will cost DM250m (Pounds 102m).
The first DM90m instalment was made yesterday, the second DM90m is due next
March with a final DM70m due in March 1995.
T&amp;N's share price rose 7p to 184p yesterday amid enthusiasm for the deal
among institutional investors.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said he was not too concerned
that the German economy appeared to be heading more rapidly into recession
than was anticipated last December.
'We envisaged significant cost reductions and restructuring so our forward
projections were based on a lower volume than business was operating on
historically,' he said. The group was assuming that the German economy would
be improving by 1995. It thought German car production would fall 15 per
cent this year. It appears to be 20 per cent down.
Goetze, which is privately owned, is the largest producer in Europe of
piston rings for supply to vehicle makers as original equipment. It also
produces gaskets and has an important manufacturing presence in the US.
It has six plants in Germany and five in the US, as well as others in France
and Turkey.
Mr Hope said the group had been hoping to do a vendor placing but tax
problems and complexities arising from the family shareholdings made this
difficult. The placing means T&amp;N will be restricted from making further
placings for a year.
T&amp;N said yesterday that Goetze would have significant strategic benefits for
the group and would strengthen its position as a supplier of components to
original equipment manufacturers.

   Revenue rose 14% to $92.7 million from $81.5 million.
Last year's first-quarter net loss included a gain of $26,000 from discontinued operations.

   The company said that contributing to its loss was a squeeze on margins for its computer systems.
However, order backlog for its Convergent Technologies unit increased $5 million from the end of 1987.

   Convergent supplies computer systems sold through original-equipment manufacturers through its Convergent Technologies unit, and markets directly to independent businesses through its Convergent Business Systems unit.

strong sales of its Windows operating system program, writes Louise Kehoe in
San Francisco.
Net income for the quarter, ended March 31, was Dollars 179m, or 90 cents

FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (1): Farewell to
sweat-shops - A rapidly rising proportion of electronic equipment is now
manufactured on behalf of the big international suppliers by outside
contractors. Paul Taylor probes the reasons for the emergence of this
expanding force within one of the world's predominant industries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CONTRACT electronics manufacturing (CEM) has become the fastest growing
sector of the European electronics industry and is on target to become a
Dollars 22bn global business by the mid-1990s.
In the UK a group of dedicated contract electronics manufacturers have
successfully shaken off the second-rate 'sweat-shop' image of sub-contract
and assembly work in the 1960s by investing heavily in advanced production
and test equipment, training and quality processes.
Today their big customers are blue chip multinationals such as IBM, Sony,
Bosch, Motorola, AEG, and Matsushita which require fast response times,
flexibility and first class quality, as well as cost-effective
manufacturing. These companies are using contract manufacturers as part of
their global strategies to maintain and improve international
competitiveness.
From humble beginnings the UK industry has entered what Mr Bruce Armstrong,
managing director of SCI Europe, describes as its third phase - strategic
global partnerships between OEMs and contract manufacturers which can
provide full turnkey services from design and printed circuit board layout,
through to product distribution.
A handful of factors have fuelled the growth in CEM over the past decade. In
particular, the pace of technological change has resulted in shortened
product life cycles requiring increased manufacturing flexibility and
worldwide manufacturing capability. In order to remain competitive in fast
moving consumer-led markets companies have had to reduce the period it takes
to bring new products to market.
At the same time electronic controls are replacing electro-mechanical
devices in many consumer products such as cars and medical equipment whose
manufacturers have little or no electronics manufacturing experience or
capacity.
Meanwhile, the continuing push for smaller, more portable but more
sophisticated products such as mobile phones and notebook computers requires
greater silicon integration and results in more complex devices. These are
best manufactured using advanced techniques for placing components on
printed circuit boards such as surface mount technology which require
expensive specialist machinery and expertise to design, assemble and test
and which involve considerable 'manufacturing risk' because of market
volatility.
The trend towards CEM also mirrors the move towards buying in a wide range
of service and other peripheral corporate functions, backed by the
management theory that organisations should focus on their 'core
competencies' and contract out every thing else - creating what some
observers have called 'the virtual corporation'.
Recessionary pressures have forced some managements to reconsider the 'make
or buy' decision. But generally, although contract manufacturing can result
in cost savings, most participants argue this should not be the primary
motivation.
The arrival of the single European market has encouraged many Japanese and
other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to set up locally in Europe.
As MHM, a market research organisation based in Ayr, Scotland, noted in its
latest study of the European CEM market, business from these companies 'has
fuelled spectacular expansion in at least one CEM house'.
MHM describes the growth of the UK market in the 1980s as 'spectacular'. The
turnover of the six largest sub-contract companies in the UK, SCI, Race,
Avex, AB, Philips, Welwyn and Timex, grew by an average 42 per cent per year
between 1984 and 1990.
Growth has slowed considerably since then, in part reflecting the recession
and the sharp price war in the computer and IT sector which accounts for a
still large, but declining, proportion of the CEM industry order book - a
trend which has been partly offset by increased demand from new customers in
the automotive, telecommunications and industrial sectors.
According to the Association of Contract Electronics Manufacturers (ACeM),
part of the Electronic Components Industry Federation (ECIF), formed in 1990
to provide a voice for the emerging industry, the overall UK market was
worth about Pounds 550m last year, and is growing at an underlying annual
rate of 10-15 per cent. ACeM membership now totals 48 contractors
representing 70-80 per cent of the UK CEM industry which, despite being
capital intensive, employs around 10,000 people.
'Rapid growth over the last 10 years has resulted in a fragmented industry
expanding on the back of a rapidly expanding electronics industry,' said Mr
Eric Luckwell, chairman of Datalink Services, a small Loughborough-based
CEM, in a study of the UK market.
'The capability of these organisations ranges from the very high volume and
complex technological process, such as surface mount technology and
automatic component insertion, to the very low volume and simple labour
intensive processes,' he said.
Mr Derek Duffett, ACeM director, groups the UK CEM market into four groups.
Large companies dedicated to contract electronics include SCI and Avex,
Scottish subsidiaries of US groups, which are also multinationals in their
own right and whose main business is high volume, low margin work for big
OEMs.
Their particular strengths are their capacity, sophisticated automated
manufacturing systems, substantial component purchasing power and worldwide
facilities. 'Our customers are global, so are we,' says Carol Brannigan,
Avex Electronic's European sales and marketing director and chairman of
ACeM's Promotions Committee.
'European customers and global companies operating in Europe are telling us
they need total product life cycle management services not just PCB assembly
and test,' she says. In response big CEMs are building what she calls 'a
transparent or seamless partnership' linking CEM and customer using
electronic data interchange (EDI), integrated MRP (Materials Requirement
Planning) systems, CAD/CAM design systems and electronic mail.
Medium-sized dedicated CEMs are the second group. These generally maintain
close links with OEM design houses working in specialist applications areas,
such as the industrial and professional markets. Almost half of ACeM's
membership falls into this category with most companies employing between
100 and 500 people. They include Welwyn Systems, the contract electronics
subsidiary of the TT Group which also acquired AB Contract Electronics last
year, and Race Electronics. Small start-up companies, the third group,
emphasise their flexibility and personalised service, particularly to
entrepreneurial businesses which may want prototypes built and tested or
require low to medium manufacturing volumes.
The in-house contracting departments of original equipment manufacturers.
These units have been created to fill spare capacity or diversify into new
areas. Established players include Philips Circuit assemblies and Rank-Xerox
Manufacturing Services. These companies often have access to specialised
environmental and test equipment in design and failure analysis.
Recently they have been joined by other OEMs with excess capacity which,
together with the arrival in Europe of new Far East competitors such as
Flextronics, is causing concern in an industry which arguably already has
excess capacity and thin margins.
'Presently the CEM industry can stand the additional capacity better than
many other mature electronics sectors,' said the MHM report, 'but this
situation will not continue indefinitely.'
An industry shake-out and reorganisation is widely expected amid forecasts
that the industry will become increasingly polarised between the high
volume, low margin multinational CEMs, and the much smaller niche companies.
Mr Gordon Stewart, UK director of specialist management consultants
Pittiglio Rabin Todd &amp; McGrath, told an ACeM conference in October that the
dominant feature of the CEM industry in the 1990s will be the performance
gap between an emerging super- league of multinational manufacturers and a
horde of increasingly marginalised smaller competitors.
Because the UK market is maturing most of the large CEMs are adopting the
twin strategies of trying to win back business which has gone offshore,
particularly to the Far East, while also expanding overseas themselves.
Armed with internationally accepted quality assurance standards and total
quality management programmes the UK's leading CEMs have been stressing the
importance of looking at total costs - including loss of flexibility and
transport delays - in their attempts to win back offshore business, and have
been having some success. They are also helped by the increasingly capital
intensive nature of the business, which means that labour cost differentials
are growing less important.
However, they are handicapped by the prevailing duty and tariff structure
which provides a significant incentive to import printed circuit boards or
fully built equipment, which are mostly subject to a 4.5 per cent tariff,
rather than semiconductors and other components which are generally subject
to a 14 per cent tariff. The ACeM has begun to campaign for a more even
playing field, arguing that a tariff change could help generate thousands of
manufacturing jobs in the UK.
At the same time some CEMs have begun to establish footholds on the
continent. The UK CEM market is considerably more developed than most of its
European counter parts. The Germany market in particular is expected to grow
rapidly and, together with France, is attracting attention.
Overall the European CEM market is reckoned to be worth about Dollars 6bn -
which still leaves OEMs undertaking the vast majority of electronics
manufacturing in-house. Despite their growth contract manufacturers have
still only captured a fraction of the potential European market.
Arguably, of all the changes in the electronics industry over the past
decade, the one that has gone most unnoticed, has been the emergence of
quality contract electronics manufacturers. That is now changing.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Regulation crossroads for US vehicle
makers - Environment and safety laws are set to lead to higher costs, but
also new opportunities for parts suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US environmental and safety legislation could cost the country's motor
industry an extra Dollars 40bn annually in parts, materials and services by
the late 1990s, aspirant equipment suppliers to the North American market
heard yesterday. The aggregate figure works out at Dollars 5,000 for each
vehicle.
The effect of the changes will spread down to the 'aftermarket', the market
for spare parts, accessories and chemicals supplied to vehicles on the road.
Aftermarket requirements could provide business worth at least another
Dollars 40bn.
'We are living in a world of regulatory activity that is frightening,' Mr
Bob Miller, president of the US Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association,
complained to UK motor component executives at a meeting in Birmingham.
Yet Mr Miller's complaint has its silver lining for actual and potential
suppliers to the US original equipment market and its aftermarket. This was
made clear by Knibb Gormezano and Partners, consultants, in a report* on the
North American motor market, commissioned by the UK Department of Trade and
Industry and presented to the Birmingham meeting.
The report noted that environmental and safety considerations were one of
five background factors affecting both future vehicle production in North
America and 'the aspirations of potential off-shore suppliers'.
As part of the realigning relations between the motor manufacturers and the
component suppliers, much of the work on meeting higher environmental
standards would not be undertaken by the motor manufacturers. 'A large
proportion of the research and development into more
environmentally-friendly vehicles is sub-contracted to outside companies,'
said Knibb Gormezano.
facturers want urgent solutions to the environmental demands, 'any British
manufacturer which has, or could have, products which help meet the demands
will find a multitude of ready ears'.
But this does not suggest that the North American market is suddenly free
and easy. Manufacturers at the Birmingham meeting observed that the US
market takes just as long to penetrate as the Japanese motor market. The
leading British component manufacturers - GKN, Lucas, T&amp;N for example - have
been active in the market for years and have local manufacturing capacity.
Indeed, over the last two years, partly reflecting the relative strength of
the EC and the US motor markets and emphasising the growing globalisation of
the vehicle industry, British motor industry exports to the US declined in
value. In 1990 they were worth Pounds 1.18bn; in 1991 Pounds 772m. By
comparison, exports to the German, French, Belgian and Spanish markets rose.
While the US motor manufacturers may need need new equipment, the recession
has ensured that they will not be producing vast new numbers of vehicles.
Knibb Gormezano observed that the recession had caused an 18 per cent
decline in volume since 1988 and that lost volume was not likely to be fully
recovered until 1995.
The effect of the recession is the second of the factors affecting the
aspirations of potential suppliers. But the mere recital of numbers hides
changes which have been taking place in the US industry, most notably the
loss of share by the Big Three manufacturers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - to
the Japanese car makers. However, the Japanese manufacturers will use the
US, just as they are starting to use the UK, as a springboard for exports.
The third factor affecting new entrants to the market is exchange rate
volatility, not a new phenomenon. But currency shifts such as the 10 per
cent decline in the value of sterling against the dollar in February-March
1992 can skew margin and profit calculations.
A new surge of protectionist sentiment is the fourth factor. Knibb Gormezano
has noticed no shift in commercial purchasing practices because of it and
commented that 'Japan is very much at the centre of the debate'. But
problems could emerge for European companies if US restraint actions
designed to fit one problem are couched in multilateral terms.
Negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement between the US,
Canada and Mexico are the fifth factor. This may have the effect of shifting
more labour-intensive production to Mexico, but the main victim of this
process is likely to be the Canadian component sector rather than the
European.

<HL> Digital Gets Tough With Once-Friendly Competitors

Computer Maker Pulls Welcome Mat
On Resellers, Peripheral Makers

   Like the pilot fish that hover near a shark, small companies often gather around a big company in an uneasy symbiotic relationship.
Sometimes the big fish decides the little fish are getting fat at its expense -- and turns on them.

   Something like that is happening between Digital Equipment Corp. and the smaller companies that resell its computers or make low-priced peripherals that compete with Digital's own products.

   Digital is embroiled in at least six lawsuits against companies that sell compatible computer products and services to its customers.
It is aggressively blocking customers from making easy profits by simply reselling Digital's popular computers.
It is limiting licenses of a new computer design, thus frustrating makers of compatible equipment.

   But Digital's new get-tough policy is risky.
While it may well boost sales short term, the strategy could hurt sales long term by turning allies into enemies.

   "DEC is making a big error," says Miles Efron, vice president of Standard Memories Inc., a Santa Ana, Calif., maker of parts for Digital computers.
"One of the things that has made Digital successful is the fact they have had a myriad of people developing the goodies the world out there wants."
Others think the policy may distract Digital.
"Instead of focusing on smashing the Evil Blue Empire (International Business Machines Corp.), Digital is beating on the third-party market," says R. David Mallery, editorial director of DEC Professional, a trade publication.

   Digital executives say the company remains open to compatible equipment that doesn't violate its own patents.
And it continues to encourage small companies to buy and resell Digital computers, so long as they add value in some way.
But, says John C. McKeen, vice president and group manager of channels marketing, Digital "is trying to change relationships" with resellers by coordinating sales to big customers through Digital salespeople -- a change that dismays some resellers.

   Spats among computer makers, resellers and compatible-parts makers are common.
In small markets, computer makers are happy to have manufacturers make compatible equipment and to have dealers handle small sales.
But as soon as a market gets big or a dealer cracks major accounts, the computer company wants the business for itself.
For example, sales-channel conflicts between IBM and its resellers and dealers are legion.

   Historically, Digital has been unusually hospitable to so-called original-equipment manufacturers that write software or incorporate Digital minicomputers into their products and then resell them.
Mr. McKeen says that 30% to 35% of sales continue to be made through third parties, as in the past.
But during the past two years, Digital has built up its own sales force and increasingly has emphasized sales to endusers.

   This year, Digital is enjoying the brightest success of any major computer company.
For the first six months of its current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 1987, net income more than doubled to a record $452.6 million, or $3.39 a share, as revenue surged 24% to $4.31 billion.
Meanwhile, rivals ranging from IBM to Wang Laboratories Inc. and Data General Corp. are struggling.

   Digital's success is boosting results for a host of smaller companies that have hitched their wagons to the Digital star.
EMC Corp., a Natick, Mass.-based maker of computer memories and peripherals for minicomputers, reported nine-month sales doubled to $47.3 million and net income rose 170%.
Once-struggling concerns such as disk drive maker Micropolis Corp., based in Chatsworth, Calif., are showing healthy profits.

   John Gantz, vice president at Technology Financial Services, a Chelmsford, Mass.-based research concern, estimates the third-party market built up around Digital reached $6 billion in sales in 1985 -- equal to about 75% of Digital's sales -- and is growing faster than Digital itself.
Digital has reason to want a bigger share of that.
Mr. Gantz notes that despite its recent health, Digital still trails IBM in such measures of efficiency and productivity as revenue and earnings per employee.

   Now, Digital is warning resellers away from prime business.
"They have targeted accounts such as large banks and government and the Fortune 500.
They've said, 'You'll be spinning your wheels in there,'" says James E. Sommer, president of TriLogic Corp., a Canonsburg, Pa., reseller.
TriLogic now is concentrating on companies with less than $50 million in sales.
Digital gives hefty discounts to large corporations buying dozens of computers so the resellers can't compete with Digital salespeople.

   Moreover, Digital is strongly enforcing contracts with resellers that keep them from just buying from Digital at a discount and then reselling.
Digital says it has terminated a growing number of such brokers in recent years.
"We've taken all the steps the legal department allows," says Mr. McKeen.

   Digital's pricing policies also are making it harder for some resellers.
In the past, many resellers provided repair services.
But last year Digital started including a one-year service contract in the price of a new series of computers, whether sold to a user or a reseller.
"We simplified (original-equipment manufacturers') life. (But) the way we did it impacted their margins," says Mr. McKeen.

   And some resellers appear to be defecting.
A rival computer maker, Computer Consoles Inc. of Waltham, Mass., says it has signed up eight Digital resellers in the past six months.

   Mr. McKeen says Digital salespeople are actually helping the resellers sell products that they make and Digital doesn't.
Some resellers agree.
For example, Christopher Fadden, president of Cyberchron Corp., Cold Spring, N.Y., says Digital even paid to make a video of a Digital computer that Cyberchron adapts for severe conditions.
The video shows the computer surviving fire, smoke and water.
"We can grow dramatically because we leverage through their sales force," says Mr. Fadden.

   Changing Digital policies also have angered some customers who were told they couldn't transfer certain software licenses when they sell old computers.
Osman Ahmad, manager of technical services for the Association of American Railroads, a trade group, complains that Digital "is a different company now than it used to be.
They're becoming more like IBM, but without the same savvy."
Mr. Ahmad decided against buying a $50,000 Digital software package in part because he feared it couldn't be resold.

   Digital's relations with compatible makers are even more contentious than they are with resellers.
No companies make clones of Digital computers, as some do of IBM mainframes and personal computers.
But a number of companies produce parts, such as memory boards, terminals and disk-drive controllers, that hook into Digital computers.
"Digital is taking very aggressive steps to protect its share of that market," says Vipul Mehta, vice president for Peripheral Concepts Inc., a Garden Grove, Calif., market researcher.

   Digital has cut prices sharply on many peripherals, becoming tougher competition for the third-party manufacturers.

   More dramatically, Digital has repeatedly gone to court charging compatible makers with patent infringement or theft of trade secrets.
"DEC has sued the largest vendor in each compatible market," says Jonathan Cohler, editor in chief of Digital Review, a bimonthly magazine.

   That pattern suggests more than just protecting Digital's rights, competitors say.
System Industries Inc., Milpitas, Calif., charges in a countersuit to a 1980 patent-infringement charge that Digital's suits "are to acquire and maintain an unlawful monopoly on the sale of DEC-compatible peripherals."

   Such suits can intimidate customers.
"Everyone is watching the suit," says Jay O'Donald, a vice president of Emulex Corp., Costa Mesa, Calif.
A federal court enjoined Emulex from making certain products after Digital sued, saying their design was stolen by a former employee.
Emulex denies stealing Digital trade secrets.

   And Digital's actions scare some compatible makers.
For example, fear of lawsuits has kept almost all the compatible makers from developing cut-rate parts for Digital's newest series of computers, which were designed with some proprietary internal connections that make reverse engineering difficult.

   A spokesman for Digital says that the company always has pursued patent infringers to protect its research and development investment.
He says the actions are attracting attention now only because of Digital's success.

   IEC Electronics Corp. expects to report that net income for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 52% as sales eased 9.4%.

   The contract electronics maker earned about $230,000, or seven cents a share, compared with $484,000, or 23 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
The latest per-share amounts are based on 2.7 million shares outstanding, compared with 1.8 million a year ago.

   Roger E. Main, president and chief executive officer, estimated that sales dipped to $3.8 million from $4.2 million.

   IEC expects to report full-year net rose 11% to 13%, however, as sales grew 10%.

   The company earned between $1,202,000 and $1,224,000, or 52 cents to 53 cents a share, compared with $1.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in fiscal 1985.
In the latest year, shares outstanding climbed to 2.3 million from 1.8 million.
Sales increased to about $15.8 million from $14.4 million.

   Mr. Main said that he expects 1987 to be "a pretty decent year for the computer industry" based on a recent increase in the requests for bids the company is receiving from customers.
IEC's primary business is assembling and manufacturing electronic parts such as surface-mounted printed circuit boards and chassis assemblies for original-equipment manufacturers.
These concerns include International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.

sort of wonder how much better it can get.";    Mike Hallman, president and
chief operating officer, said: "These results reflect record revenue from both
worldwide retail and worldwide OEM (original equipment manufacturers') sales
channels.";    The earnings were announced after the close of trading Tuesday,
during which Microsoft's stock fell $1, to $65.50, in the over-the-counter
market.;    Readerman said the results were in line with or a little better
than Wall Street expectations and that Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., had
improved its already high net profit margins.;    In the fourth quarter, net
income was 26.3 percent of revenues.;    Microsoft's results were paced by

times the size of Lotus Development Corp., the second-largest publicly traded
personal computer software company.;    Microsoft has been gaining market
share in part because many other software companies do not have programs yet

advanced memory chips capacity
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE semiconductor makers are stepping up investment in next-generation
dynamic random access memory chips in a bid to take advantage of strong
demand for advanced memory chips from the personal computer industry and
stay ahead of rivals in the highly competitive market.
Hitachi yesterday became the latest company to announce it will increase
investment in 16-megabit dRAMs to bring worldwide capacity at its dRAM
factories to about 2m chips a month by the end of next year.
The company produces about 300,000 16-megabit dRAMs a month in Japan, but it
plans to start manufacturing the chips at its German plant next year. It
will invest Y60bn (Dollars 566m) by the end of fiscal 1996.
Hitachi's move follows the earlier decision by NEC to bring a semiconductor
facility on stream to manufacture 16-megabit dRAMS next year. NEC's
facility, which had been built but not equipped, will eventually have the
capacity to manufacture 4m dRAMs per month, the company said.
Meanwhile, Fujitsu, one of Japan's leading semiconductor makers, and
Hyundai, the Korean company, agreed earlier this month to co-operate in the
development of 16-megabit dRAMs. Hitachi also agreed earlier this month to
transfer 16-megabit technology to Goldstar of Korea and buy back chips on an
original equipment manufacturing basis.

FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese camera makers turn in
gloomy results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's camera makers have been forced to readjust their focus amid a gloomy
earnings season in which Minolta, once the industry leader, reported an
after-tax loss of Y25.8bn (Dollars 199m) and most other producers predicted
a bleak year ahead.
Restructuring programmes in the industry, begun when the domestic economy
was expanding rapidly, have run into the troubles of recession, complicating
the companies' entry into new markets.
Earnings at Minolta were also dragged down by the settlement of a US patent
dispute in March, forcing the company to write-off Y16.9bn. This came on top
of a pre-tax loss of Y8.5bn, a turnround from a profit of Y4.9bn the
previous year and the company's first loss for 26 years.
Minolta was also weakened by stock market turmoil, as its unrealised gains
on long-term holdings of shares fell from Y57bn to Y27.7bn, and cash
deposits, seen as a mark of strength in Japan, were halved to Y14.5bn.
Traditionally strong in foreign markets, Minolta's long-term strategy
included the aims of increasing the share of domestic camera sales and
expanding the office equipment business.
But the company has had difficulty penetrating the crowded domestic office
equipment market, where its sales last year fell 5.6 per cent, while exports
of office machinery rose 7.3 per cent - camera exports fell 12.8 per cent
and domestic camera sales were down 7.9 per cent.
Minolta's total sales for the year were 2.9 per cent lower at Y215.6bn, and
while the company confidently predicted sales would rise to Y228bn in the
current period, it forecast another pre-tax loss of Y4bn.
Nikon, the camera and semiconductor equipment maker, reported a 62.4 per
cent plunge to Y7.2bn in its pre-tax profit, following weak demand from
Japanese semiconductor producers, which are facing large losses on their
investments in the present generation of memory chips.
Sales for the year fell 9.4 per cent to Y230.6bn, and Nikon forecast a
difficult year ahead, with sales expected at Y228bn and pre-tax profits
declining to Y4bn. By product line, camera sales fell 6 per cent and
semiconductor equipment by 21.2 per cent.
Ricoh, now reliant on copiers and information equipment for most of its
sales, reported a 70.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y7.4bn, and a 0.7
per cent sales decline at Y672.7bn. The company said the weakness of the US
market hurt original equipment manufacturer orders for its copiers and fax
machines.
It also blamed 'currency fluctuations' for the downturn, that is, the
appreciation of the yen.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will
produce computer memory chips for the international market under a
joint venture with Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan, the
companies announced.
   The five-year agreement between Mitsubishi and AT&amp;T
Microelectronics, an AT&amp;T division based in Berkeley Heights, N.J.,
involves technology sharing, worldwide marketing and manufacturing
of SRAM microchips, company officials said Thursday.
   SRAM is an acronym for static random access memory, a type of
computer memory chip that stores information as long as the power
to the computer is maintained. SRAMs are used in computer
workstations, advanced personal computers, super minicomputers and
telecommunications equipment.
   Mitsubishi will provide design and engineering expertise for the
chips, which will be made at AT&amp;T's Orlando semiconductor plant.
   This is the first time AT&amp;T has teamed up with a Japanese
company in the semiconductor business, said company officials, who
refused to disclose terms of the multimillion-dollar deal.
   AT&amp;T hopes the venture will enhance the company's efforts to
sell chips on the international market, officials said.
   ``Our goal is to rapidly increase sales worldwide to
original-equipment manufacturers,'' William J. Warwick, president
of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, said in a statement.
   Preliminary work on the SRAM chip already has begun in Orlando,
said Mary Lou Ambrus, a spokeswoman for AT&amp;T Microelectronics
   Last month, International Business Machines Corp. and Siemens AG
of West Germany announced a joint venture to develop advanced
computer memory chips.

   Sequent Computer Systems Inc., Beaverton, Ore., stung by
plunging sales of its high-performance computers, reported a
second-quarter net loss of $19.7 million, or 86 cents a
share.
   The loss included a $7.6 million charge related to the
company's de-emphasis of the troubled high-performance
machine segment; those machines have higher margins than
Sequent's other computer products. Sequent said the
restructuring includes eliminating about 150 jobs, or 8% of
its work force.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue tumbled 14% to $50.1 million from $58.2 million a
year ago. In the year-earlier quarter, Sequent earned $5.7
million, or 24 cents a share.
   Scott Gibson, president, said the results reflect the
"progressive collapse" of sales of the company's high-end
computers. He said sales in that segment crashed to $5
million in the latest quarter, from $18 million in the third
quarter of 1990. Also, sales of Sequent's other products have
been hurt by the recession, he said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sequent
closed at $9.25, up 50 cents.

   SEQUENT COMPUTER SYSTEMS Inc.'s second-quarter net loss
resulted from sharply declining original equipment
manufacturer sales, which are sales to customers who then
resell the products under their own labels. Sequent is
de-emphasizing that segment. The company said the remainder
of its high-performance computer segment performed well in
the quarter. Thursday's edition misstated the reason for the
loss.

pact
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-PACKARD has signed an extensive technology-sharing pact with Convex
Computer, a leading manufacturer of mini super-computers. To cement the new
relationship, Hewlett-Packard will take a 5 per cent equity stake in Convex
for Dollars 18m.
Convex will also adopt Hewlett-Packard's Reduced Instruction Set Computing
(RISC) microprocessor technology for use in a new range of massively
parallel processing super-computers. Convex will purchase the microprocessor
chips from HP.
HP and Convex will also exchange software technologies, including HP's RISC
compiler technology and Convex's supercomputer compiler technology.
Massively parallel supercomputers combine the power of hundreds, or even
thousands, of microprocessors to reach very high processing speed.
HP and Convex also plan to reach an agreement to offer each others products
for sale on a bilateral original equipment manufacturer basis.
The agreement represents a win for HP, which is competing with Sun
Microsystems, Digital Equipment, International Business Machines and others
to establish its RISC technology as a broadly-used industry standard.
Hewlett-Packard is the third largest US computer manufacturer with 1991
revenues of Dollars 14.5bn. The company was an early leader in RISC, which
is emerging as a key technology in all types of computers.
Convex is a 10-year-old company, based in Dallas. Microsoft said yesterday
it would launch a new version of its widely-used Windows personal computer
program next month and expects to sell 1m copies within 30 days.
The announcement appears designed to pre-empt International Business
Machines' expected introduction, later this month, of a competing operating
system for personal computers.
The former partners are gearing up for a marketing battle. Microsoft will
for the first time use television advertising to promote Windows. IBM is
also planning a publicity blitz.
Price competition is also expected to be fierce, with Microsoft offering a
Windows upgrade package to current users for Dollars 50. At issue is control
over the direction of personal computer software.
Windows provides personal computer users with a graphical interface, similar
to the Apple Macintosh.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: No quick recovery from IBM's big
blues - Analysts see further losses at the troubled computer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE summer of 1993 brought big changes for International Business Machines.
These included a new management structure and accelerated cost cutting - but
not, it appears, any sign of recovery from two years of heavy losses.
Even the most optimistic analysts are predicting that today, IBM, once the
bluest of the blue chip stocks, will report a loss for its third quarter.
The only question is how deep the red ink will flow. While the consensus is
an operating loss of about Dollars 170m, or 30 cents per share, it could be
double that, some IBM-watchers fear.
The stage has been set for IBM by disappointing results from several other
companies in the computer sector. Digital Equipment, in the midst of
restructuring, last week reported net losses of Dollars 83m on revenues of
Dollars 3bn for its first quarter, in spite of a Dollars 20m lift from
accounting changes.
Digital's revenues declined almost 10 per cent from the same period last
year, reflecting weak sales in Europe - particularly Germany and Italy - the
company said. Even Hewlett-Packard, which earlier reported a 44 per cent
earnings rise to Dollars 271m for its third quarter, ending in July, with
revenues up 23 per cent at Dollars 5bn, saw a sharp drop in European order
growth rates to 10 per cent, from 28 per cent growth in the previous
quarter.
Depressed economic conditions in Europe, the largest export market for the
US computer industry, are taking their toll on companies and IBM is expected
to be no exception.
Last year, European sales of Dollars 23.75bn accounted for almost 37 per
cent of IBM's total revenues. Germany, Italy and France are IBM's largest
European markets. Thus the continuing weakness of the European economy
represents one of the most formidable barriers to IBM's efforts to return to
profitability.
Another factor in the gloomy projections for IBM's third-quarter performance
is rapidly declining mainframe computer prices. Mainframe computers,
together with associated storage devices represent about 20 per cent of
IBM's revenues.
Amdahl, one of IBM's direct competitors in the mainframe computer market, is
due to report this week. The company has warned it expected to report an
operating loss 'considerably larger' than its second-quarter Dollars 23.7m
loss.
The company cited slow mainframe computer sales and 'intense competitive
pressure on pricing' as the principal reasons for anticipated losses.
Industry analysts say mainframe prices have declined by about 40 per cent in
the 12 months ending in July, with IBM driving the trend with heavy
discounting.
The personal computer market, in contrast, is rising and after losing market
share to competitors, the IBM PC is on the rebound. IBM's share of the
worldwide PC market rose to 14.9 per cent in the first quarter of this year
from 10.9 per cent in 1992, according to IDC, a market research group.
Yet IBM's ability to take advantage of strong demand for its PCs has been
hampered by parts shortages. In particular, IBM has been unable to get
enough of the active-matrix flat panel displays used in its popular Thinkpad
portable notebook computers.
Analysts estimate IBM may have lost as much as Dollars 1bn of business in
the third quarter because of inability to keep pace with demand for its PC
products.
Similar problems dogged Apple Computer and Compaq Computer last year and
industry executives see the ability to forecast demand accurately - and
order parts in advance - as a critical element of success in the PC market
that IBM has yet to master.
Rival Compaq Computer, which last week reported a 64 per cent jump in sales
to Dollars 1.75bn for the third quarter, with income more than doubling to
Dollars 107m, seems to have been the chief beneficiary of IBM's supply
constraints.
'Compaq is well prepared with manufacturing capacity and parts availability
to take advantage of the strong demand we are experiencing,' said Mr Eckhard
Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive.
As in other segments of the computer industry, personal computer profit
margins are declining rapidly amid intense price competition.
Apple Computer, which reported its results this month, saw gross margins
fall to below 26 per cent from above 40 per cent. In spite of record
revenues of Dollars 2.14bn for its fourth fiscal quarter, Apple recorded a
meagre net profit of Dollars 2.7m, down 97 per cent from the same period
last year.
IBM's painful struggles to adjust to lower gross margins have seen its
workforce cut by 125,000 since the end of 1986. Another 60,000 workers are
expected to leave the company before the end of 1994. The company has
written off Dollars 2.9bn in assets this year, half of it in manufacturing
facilities.
While the short-term outlook for IBM is still bleak, at least one analyst
believes Big Blue is on the right track.
'I'm not predicting it will happen in the fourth quarter or in the first
quarter of next year, but the ingredients are in place for a recovery,' says
Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers in San Francisco.
IBM's operating expenses and manufacturing costs are now 'almost at parity'
with industry competitors, Mr Jones says.
There is a new 'fire in the belly' of its product divisions; a new
determination to beat external competitors rather than squabble among
internal divisions, he believes.
The decline in IBM's mainframe computer business will bottom out in
1995-1996, Mr Jones predicts. The company's introduction - expected next
year - of parallel processing mainframe computer technology could lead to a
reduction in mainframe computer costs, creating stronger demand.
'Of the data stores in Fortune 500 companies, 80 per cent is on mainframe
computers today,' Mr Jones points out. He expects IBM's new parallel
processing technology, which will not require any software changes, to be an
important factor in IBM's recovery.
New sources of revenue and profit for IBM include its emerging merchant
semiconductor business.
Until recently, it has manufactured semiconductor chips only for its own
use, but it has set aggressive goals to become a multi-billion dollar chip
supplier to outside customers over the next few years.
Chips are one example of IBM's strategy to sell technology, components and
even finished products to other companies, rather than end-users. IBM has
set a goal of Dollars 3bn in original-equipment sales to industry customers
this year.
These efforts are unlikely, to yield short-term returns and today's
third-quarter financial report is expected to demonstrate that there is no
quick fix for IBM's big blues.

FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Navistar reports deficit of
Dollars 32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAVISTAR, the leading North American manufacturer of medium and heavy
trucks, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 32m and said
it also expected to be in the red in the second quarter.
The group, which has been hit hard by weak demand for trucks due to the US
recession, said its loss worked through at 16 cents a share.
This compared with a net loss of Dollars 38m, or 18 cents a share, in the
first quarter of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 902m, up 7
per cent.
Truck shipments totalled 17,100 units, up 3 per cent, mainly because of
higher shipments of school-bus chassis to customers who normally took
delivery later in the year.
Shipments of medium-range diesel engines to original equipment manufacturers
increased 11 per cent, reflecting higher retail demand for diesel powered
trucks and vans.
Navistar said it had increased its share of the North American retail market
for medium and heavy trucks to 28.1 per cent, from 26.5 per cent in the
first quarter of last year.
The industry sales of medium and heavy trucks fell 9 per cent from a year
earlier to 52,800 units.
Mr James Cotting, chairman, said Navistar's margins had improved slightly
from the 1991 first quarter because of the additional sales volume and the
impact of a cost reduction programme.
He expected a moderate strengthening of the US economy as the year
progressed, but at current demand levels expected a second-quarter loss.

   A U.S. Inspector General is investigating whether certain
medical equipment manufacturers and government-owned
hospitals conspired to keep independent companies from
servicing and maintaining the manufacturers' high-tech
diagnostic machines.
   The IG's office at the Veterans Administration in
Washington, D.C., that is conducting the investigation
declined to name the company or companies and the hospitals
involved. "It wouldn't be fair to the companies and the
people if we were to identify them at this time," said
Michael Costello, assistant inspector general for
investigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He would only confirm that his office is investigating why
veterans' hospitals, in their requests for bids for service
contracts, used restrictive language that favored the
manufacturer of the machine. In response to complaints from
independent service companies, the VA's office of policy,
planning and resources reviewed the VA's service contracts.
In a special report, issued last June, it reported that 21 of
the 36 contracts it investigated "contained restrictive
specifications . . . that could only have been achieved by
the original equipment manufacturer, in this case, Picker."
   Picker International Inc., whose tactics were the subject
of a front-page story in this newspaper last October, has
installed its machines in more than 90% of the nation's VA
medical centers. The Cleveland-based unit of Britain's
General Electric Co. PLC, which isn't related to the General
Electric Co. based in Fairfield, Conn., has disagreed with
the report. Picker didn't return calls seeking comment on the
Inspector General's investigation.
   John Keller, president of Houston-based Electronics in
Medicine Inc., said a week ago that IG investigators
contacted him to ask whether he knew of any "bribery and
entertaining of VA officials by Picker." Electronics in
Medicine, also known as ETEK, is an independent service
company that has sued Picker in a federal court in Texas,
charging, among other things, "tortious interference with
existing and prospective contracts" by Picker.
   Thomas Quinn, president of IES Inc., a Pittsburgh-based
independent service company also involved in litigation
against Picker, said federal investigators "spent a whole
day" going through his files in search of evidence of whether
"Picker influenced government employees."
   Mr. Costello, the assistant inspector general for
investigation at the VA, said his investigators are looking
at whether there is any evidence of "fraud, conflict of
interest, and bribery" and will turn over the findings to the
U.S. Justice Department to determine whether any action is
warranted.
   The high-tech medical machines, such as computed
tomography or CT, and magnetic resonance imaging or MRI,
machines, are used in imaging internal organs for medical
diagnosis. They cost between $1 million and $2 million
apiece, and hospitals that purchase them also obtain
contracts to service and maintain the machines. The cost of
these service contracts typically ranges between $125,000 and
$200,000 annually.
   This service and maintenance market, estimated to be about
$3 billion annually, is dominated by the manufacturers of the
machines, which include General Electric Co. of Fairfield,
Conn., N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, Germany's Siemens AG,
and Japan's Toshiba Corp. A burgeoning industry of
independent service organizations, which hospitals say offer
similar service contracts at 40% to 50% cheaper, have been
complaining in their suits and countersuits against the
manufacturers that they are being kept out of the market by
the manufacturers' restrictive software licensing agreements
and parts-supply policies.
   The broader issue of whether manufacturers' refusal to
license crucial diagnostic software, other maintenance
manuals and parts to independent companies amounts to
stifling competition is currently the subject of pending
lawsuits, including one in the U.S. Supreme Court.

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks closed mixed as
investors continued to sort through an onslaught of earnings
news.
   Concerns about disappointing earnings battered technology
stocks for a second consecutive day. Even companies posting
profits within the range of analyst expectations saw their
shares marked down.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Intel fell 1 1/2 to 44 1/4 and Borland International
slipped 3/4 to 48 1/2 even though both companies' results
were on target.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which had been down as much as
2.31, closed with a slim loss of 0.18, or 0.04%, to 493.42.
Advancing issues, though, narrowly outpaced decliners, 977 to
943.
   National Market System volume totaled a moderate
118,150,000 shares, compared with 123,420,000 Tuesday.
   On the Big Board, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index eased 0.03, or 0.01%, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average slipped 5.14 to 2978.75.
   Charles Howley, manager of OTC trading at Soundview
Financial Corp., said technology stocks were in the forefront
of investors' minds yesterday. And within the technology
group, he said, all eyes were focused on Apple Computer.
   Apple, whose third-quarter earnings were awaited by
investors, closed with a loss of 1 1/4 to 42 1/2. The stock,
which lost a total of 3 points on Monday and Tuesday, had
been a bit higher earlier in the day.
   After the market closed, Apple reported a loss of 44 cents
a share for the quarter ended June 28. The Cupertino, Calif.,
concern said its results were reduced by a charge of $1.16 a
share related to restructuring and other expenses. Last year,
the company had third-quarter net of 96 cents a share.
   Soundview's Mr. Howley said he expects the tone at the
opening of OTC trading today to be largely dictated by
investors' perceptions of Apple's earnings report.
   He said the stock sold off late in the day yesterday
because of investors' reluctance to hold the issue overnight
ahead of the earnings report. "They just don't want to get
hurt by technology again," Mr. Howley said in reference to
other technology stocks that have fallen after disappointing
earnings reports. "It's been a constant barrage of misses so
people are saying, `I just don't want to take a chance,'" he
said.
   Yesterday, Intergraph lost 3 1/8 to 21 5/8 after it
recorded lower-than-expected second-quarter net of 36 cents a
share. Analysts had expected the maker of computer graphics
systems to earn about 42 cents in the period. In the
year-earlier quarter, it had net of 33 cents.
   Meanwhile, Micropolis eased 1/8 to 6 1/8. It posted
second-quarter net of two cents a share, down from 20 cents
last year. The disk-drive maker cited price competition and
the loss of some expected original equipment manufacturing
orders.
   Elsewhere, Intel eased despite reporting second-quarter
net of $1.10 a share, above the 84 cents it posted in the
year-ago period and in line with analysts' expectations.
Borland International slid despite its report late Tuesday of
earnings of 56 cents a share for its first quarter, ended
June 30, up from 32 cents last year.
   Ashton-Tate closed unchanged at 16 3/8. After the market
closed, the company posted second-quarter net of 11 cents a
share, compared with a loss of 47 cents a year ago. According
to First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Networks, analysts
had expected the software developer to earn about 13 cents a
share.
   Earnings news had a positive effect on Refac Technology.
Its shares climbed 1 3/8 to 4 1/8 after the company posted
second-quarter net of 23 cents a share, compared with a loss
of six cents last year. Refac attributed the improvement to
completion of license agreements and settlement of litigation
involving its patents.
   Co-Operative Bank of Concord added 5/8 to 2 3/4. On
Tuesday, the company posted second-quarter net income of six
cents a share, compared with a loss of 65 cents a year
earlier. The company significantly trimmed the size of its
provision for loan losses in the latest period.
   Michigan National added 1/2 to 30 1/4. It posted
higher-than-expected second-quarter net of 73 cents a share.
In the year-ago period, the bank holding company earned $1.15
a share.
   Microsoft added 1/4 to 67 3/4. The company disclosed a
reorganization of its international operations designed to
help it to manage growth overseas throughout this decade. The
move includes the structuring of its international markets
outside Europe into four geographic regions.
   Staodyn rose 1 1/8 to 6. The Food and Drug Administration
filed a pre-market approval application for the company's
Dermapulse device. The product is to be used in treating
pressure ulcers of the skin, often called bedsores.
   Compression Labs jumped 1 7/8 to 17 7/8. The company will
participate in the development of the Advanced Research
Consortium's digital simulcast high-definition television
system.
   Newport Pharmaceuticals lost 1/2 to 4 after its
Scandinavian licensee withdrew an application for Newport's
drug, Isoprinosine, under a Common Market coordinated
approval procedure. The licensee, Leo Pharmaceutical
Products, was seeking approval of the drug for use in the
early stages of AIDS. Separately, Newport posted
second-quarter net of two cents a share, compared with a
year-ago loss of 18 cents.
   Micronics Computers, a new issue, closed at 6 1/4 on 1.8
million shares. The three million-share issue for the maker
of system boards for International Business
Machines-compatible personal computers was offered at $6 a
share.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (8): French shake-out
under way - 'This could be the industry's worst year of the decade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the surface, the French automotive components industry had a reasonable
year in 1992, although there have also been some suggestions that the sector
was heading for difficulties in view of such factors as the 'franc fort'
pegged to the strength of the Deutschemark within the ERM; a shake-out of
the number of suppliers to both Renault and the PSA group; and the downward
pressure on the prices of bought-in components exerted by France's vehicle
manufacturers.
The most worrying factor for 1993, however, has been the steep downturn in
vehicle output which has characterised the first few months.
Staring at the abyss by late 1992, the components industry has seen
production in France of passenger cars fall by 13.6 per cent in the four
months to the end of April, as compared with the performance of the
comparable period of 1992.
In the commercial vehicle sector, production has performed worse still, with
output falling 30 per cent.
A succint statement from the Federation des Industries des Equipements pour
Vehicules (FIEV - the Automotive Equipment Industry Association) says it
all: '1993 has started very badly, and all the signs are that the year could
turn out to be the most difficult of the decade.'
According to FIEV, sales in 1992 by French automotive equipment
manufacturers increased by a provisionally-estimated 5.6 per cent to the
all-time record level of FFr78.8bn.
Within this total, original equipment (OE) sales to French vehicle
manufacturers accounted for a little more than half - with OE sales
increasing by a provisionally-estimated 3.4 per cent.
This was, however, below the 4.2 per cent increase in the number of vehicles
manufactured in France last year, which was the first time this phenomenon
has occurred - to the chagrin of the French components industry, this
relative decline was made all the worse in view of the accepted trend of
growth in the value of sales per vehicle manufactured in France.
Price pressures from Peugeot, Citroen and Renault on their components
suppliers was responsible, with French vehicle manufacturers under
increasing pressure to reduce their costs.
Renault suffered a pre-tax loss of FFr961m in the fourth quarter of 1992
owing in part to a FFr600m loss in franc revenue as a result of the strength
of the franc against the lire and sterling.
For 1993, Renault expects a further currency-induced reduction of FFr3bn in
taxable income. First quarter 1993 income at Renault was only one-tenth that
of the comparable period of 1992.
PSA Peugeot-Citroen saw a 39 per cent decline in profits during 1992. As the
auto equipment association says, 'since 1991 our auto-makers have increased
their pressure on (components) prices, and the favourable trend from which
we previously benefited has been destroyed by the reductions which we have
been obliged to grant them.'
Not all has been, or is, gloom for the French components manufacturers,
however. During 1992, 'aftermarket' sales within France rose by 3.5 per cent
after having effectively stagnated in 1991. This reflects the positive
effect on parts sales of the introduction of mandatory vehicle-testing
procedures.
In addition, sales by French components producers to other (generally
'first-tier') suppliers rose during 1992 by 37.2 per cent to FFr1,100m in
what looks like becoming, as a result of structural changes in the pattern
of supply, a substantial area of business in the 1990s.
Direct exports of components from France increased by 9.1 per cent in 1992
to a provisionally-estimated FFr26.6bn, although it is difficult not to
wonder for how long such a performance is possible if the franc continues to
remain one of Europe's stronger currencies (and especially in view of the
German vehicle manufacturers' desire to reduce costs sharply and speedily).
Even though relative costs within the French components industry are
generally lower than those in Germany, they have become still lower in
certain other countries since the ERM upsets of the autumn of 1992 (and most
especially so in the UK).
The Michelin group is by far the largest components manufacturer in France,
as well as being the world's leading tyre maker, and it has been affected by
the 'franc fort.'
During 1992 global sales were steady in volume terms, but turnover fell by
1.2 per cent to FFr66.8bn as a result of the strengthening franc against the
dollar, lire and sterling.
In the second half of last year, adverse exchange rates were a big factor
behind the group's move back into loss - another was a contraction in the
tyre market.
In the first quarter of 1993 the group saw volume sales of its tyres fall by
an alarming 14 per cent. This has led the company to introduce an emergency
rationalisation programme which has included short-time working in France
and the announcement of a reduction of 2,950 in Michelin's French workforce
to 1995 - which has come after 16,000 job losses worldwide over 1991-92.
France's largest non-tyre components group, Valeo, was able to look back on
1992 with some satisfaction, although the company's chairman, Noel Goutard,
has recently sounded a note of caution for 1993. In 1992 group sales
increased by 4 per cent to FFr20.6bn, of which 56 per cent derived from
outside France.
Adverse exchange rate fluctuations, however, pared an estimated 2 per cent
off turnover, which would otherwise have grown by 6 per cent. Group net
profit in 1992 rose by 26 per cent to FFr753m. For 1993, as a result of the
condition of the European motor industry, Mr Goutard has said that 'our
customers are becoming more and more demanding. Valeo intends responding to
these new challenges through cost-cutting, quality and innovation.'
This is including a reduction in the number and/or size of Valeo's European
industrial facilities during 1993.
Over the first four months of this year, Valeo's consolidated sales fell 5.1
per cent as compared with the comparable period of 1992. The second-largest
non-tyre components group in France is Epeda-Bertrand Faure - which is also
the world's leading vehicle seating manufacturer  - which achieved a 15 per
cent growth in 1992 automotive sales to FFr9.1bn (78 per cent of group
total).
Profitability of the group was affected in 1992 by such factors as exchange
rate losses arising from the effects of the September currency devaluations.
During the first four months of 1993 group auto sales were 9 per cent lower
than in the comparable period of 1992.
For the medium-term however, EBF has - in common with most of France's
larger automotive groups - already moved to minimise geographical market and
currency risks by establishing or acquiring a number of facilities in
several vehicle manufacturing countries of the world.
Domestic sales for French auto components in 1991 and 1992 were FFr50,214m
and FFr52,200m respectively.
Direct exports: FFr24,377m in 1991 and FFr26,600m in 1992.
Total sales: FFr74,591m in 1991 and FFr78,800m in 1992.
For a list of larger European component suppliers with auto-related sales of
at least Dollars 1bn, see page three.

<TEXT>
   Japan's Nikon Inc. knocked Perkin-Elmer Corp.
from its traditional top spot to become the world's No.1 seller of
equipment for semiconductor manufacturing last year, according to a
survey released Monday.
   It was the first time a Japanese company headed the list,
according to VLSI Research Inc., a San Jose, Calif.-based
consulting firm that compiles the annual list.
   Nikon moved up from seventh place on the strength of a 62
percent gain in its sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
while Perkin-Elmer's sales in the category fell 20 percent, the
consulting firm said.
   Perkin-Elmer, based in Norwalk, Conn., had held the top spot in
the world listings since 1980. One reason for its decline was the
discontinuation of two lines of business that accounted for 5
percent of its sales of semiconductor equipment, VLSI Research said.
   VLSI Research released the full results to The Associated Press
on Monday after Nikon issued a statement Monday saying it had been
listed first.
   The U.S. government has given a high priority to preserving the
health of American companies that make equipment for producing
computer chips, considering them crucial to national security.
   The industry in general, U.S. and Japanese alike, fared somewhat
better in 1987 than in 1986, partly because of streamlining and
improved market conditions, VLSI Research said.
   Nikon's 62 percent rise in sales was partly the result of an 11
percent rise in the value of the Japanese yen. Also, VLSI Research
said its estimate of the company's 1986 revenue in the category,
$149 million, was about 12 percent low.
   Japanese companies' revenue was converted to dollars at a rate
of 150.7 yen to the dollar in 1987 and 168.4 yen to the dollar in
1986.
   Here are the names of the top 10 companies in 1987, followed by
their 1986 rankings and their 1987 revenue from semiconductor
manufacturing equipment:
   _1. Nikon Inc., Japan, up from 7th, $242 million.
   _2. Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, Conn., down from 1st, $213
million.
   _3. General Signal Corp., Stamford, Conn., unchanged, $208
million.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (7): Keyed up for the world stage - Profile
of Acer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN manufacturers have not traditionally focused on marketing their own
brand-name product. Instead, they have favoured high-volume production of
low cost goods on an original equipment manufacture (OEM) basis, and the
comparatively low financial risk which OEM offers.
Acer, however, has always sought to be the exception. The company's
chairman, chief executive officer and founder, Mr Stan Shih, says he is in
the process of transforming Acer into a multinational computer company,
capable of competing with the main global players.
According to Mr Shih: 'Our aim is to motivate Taiwan's people to succeed in
removing the negative image of 'Made in Taiwan'.'
Although Mr Shih believes that he can only increase international awareness
of Acer products through marketing, Acer still relies on OEM for 30 per cent
of its business, a proportion which Mr Shih would like to see augmented to
45 per cent. 'On the whole OEM and our brand name business complement each
other,' he says. 'OEM is also a very good way to share the cost of
developing new technology.'
Underlying Acer's strategy is Mr Shih's personal blend of ancient Chinese
philosophy and modern management techniques.
'In the game of Go, first you conquer the periphery, then you conquer the
centre,' he explains. 'Because Acer is not yet big enough to compete with
the big US companies, we have found a niche in smaller markets, like South
America and south-east Asia.'
In Chile, says Mr Shih, people speak of Acer-compatible computers, rather
than IBM-compatible. 'We targeted the markets that none of the big players
had reached yet. So even with limited resources we were able to dominate
those markets,' he adds.
Acer was set up in 1976 as Multitech International with 11 employees, and
began production of IBM-compatible personal computers and software in the
early 1980s, using the same microchip and software as the IBM equivalent,
but selling for two-thirds of the price. By 1991, annual sales had totalled
around USDollars 1bn.
At a time when its competitors are hoping to sit out the downturn in the
global computer industry, Acer's own-brand business actually grew by 45 per
cent in 1991.
Acer has an annual corporate budget to boost brand awareness, of TDollars
25m, which is considered high by Taiwanese standards. It has also
restructured into a series of independent business units, designed to
decentralise decision-making, which can spend up to four times that amount
on marketing in various regions.
Earlier this year, a glossy Dollars 5m advertising campaign which uses
shadows thrown by Acer products to convey hidden qualities of the product
and images of the user, ran throughout Europe and the US. The 'shadows'
theme was conceived by Dentsu Young and Rubicam of the US, and is intended
to suggest that there is more to Acer than meets the eye.
Despite the emphasis on marketing, repeated attempts to penetrate the US
computer market have produced mixed results. In 1990, Acer tried to buy
market share by acquiring a financially stretched US minicomputer
manufacturer, Altos, for Dollars 94m.
The company had hoped to integrate its business hardware systems with Altos'
Unix-based systems thereby gaining a ready-made foothold in high end
production in the US. But minicomputers went out of fashion, and Altos
continued to lose money.
Analysts say Acer paid too much for the acquisition. Altos' losses, and
price-cutting due to the downturn in the computer market, led to Acer
reporting a net loss of USDollars 22.7m last year. However, Acer has since
reported net earnings of USDollars 3m in the six months ending June 30,
1992.
Acer's mass-merchandiser and superstore business fared somewhat better than
Altos in Europe and the US. The company's exports of lower end products
bound for outlets such as Best Buy and Bizmart of the US and Dixon's of the
UK grew by around 170 per cent in 1991.

FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Full speed ahead for IBM and
Bull - The rationale behind the computer groups' accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineers from Groupe Bull, the French computer manufacturer, will begin to
take up residence at International Business Machines' computer design centre
in Austin, Texas, within the next few days.
Their arrival will be the first and most controversial consequence of the
technological and marketing agreement concluded recently between the two
computer makers.
In Austin, the Bull team will work with IBM and its partners Apple Computers
and Motorola on the design of microchips planned to be at the heart of
tomorrow's personal computers. Bull will have a unique window into the
future of computer technology.
While almost every important detail of last week's agreement has yet to be
spelled out in detail - the size of the equity stake IBM has agreed to take
in Bull, for example, or the annual value of Bull's orders for IBM's small
disk drives - both companies appreciate the need for speed if they are to
make the most of their initiative.
Within months, Bull will be selling IBM mid-range computers badged with
Bull's green tree logo; by the end of the year, the cabinets will be Bull's
but the chips at the heart of the system will still be IBM.
The new understanding between IBM, the world's largest computer maker, and
Bull, state-owned and losing money heavily, began as a search for a
straightforward technology agreement. Bull needed a source of a new
technology called 'reduced instruction set computing (risc)' available only
from US suppliers - IBM, Hewlett Packard (HP), Digital Equipment, Sun
Microsystems and Mips. It elected to choose between IBM and HP.
IBM was looking for a partner to licence its risc technology to increase
manufacturing volumes and improve distribution. In the past year it has
struck oem (original equipment manufacturer) deals with Wang of the US for
personal computers and mid-range machines and with Siemens of Germany for
memory chips.
The deal with Bull, however, has grown into a complex, two-way relationship
which will have far-reaching consequences for the world computer industry.
'Bull's position as a viable vendor has received a much needed boost' the
Gartner Group, a well-regard-ed US consultancy said, immediately following
the deal.
Risc technology was invented by IBM. It makes possible powerful but low cost
computer systems through simple silicon chip design in combination with
complex software. It is seen as the technology of choice for mid-range
computers and, increasingly, personal computers. Typically, risc computers
run the Unix operating system, developed by AT&amp;T and set to become the
industry standard for small and medium computers.
The key to making profits from risc computers, as for personal computers, is
high volume and efficient distribution.
Mr Bob Dies, director-general, products and systems, IBM Europe, and his
opposite number at Bull, Mr Michel Bloch, managed the burden of the
negotiations. Mr Michael Armstrong, head of IBM world trade, and Mr Francis
Lorentz, Bull chairman and chief executive handled the final stages.
The French government, as Bull's majority shareholder, gave its approval to
Mr Lorentz's desire to seal a deal with IBM: 'We did not know we had been
selected until Mrs Cresson, the prime minister, announced it' Mr Dies said.
IBM lost money for the first time in 1991 and has put in place a profound
restructuring strategy to restore profitability.
There was little to choose between the risc technology on offer from IBM and
HP in the view of Bull's experts. Why then did Mr Lorentz opt for IBM? He
gave six reasons.
IBM would be prepared to take a large number, perhaps 100,000, of portable
computers a year from Bull subsidiary Zenith Data Systems to sell under its
own label.
There was the possibility of creating a separate, global, printed circuit
board business based on Bull's manufacturing facilities at Angers, France,
and Boston in the US.
Bull would take the lead in developing powerful networks of risc processors,
an advanced technology called 'symmetrical multiprocessing (smp)'. IBM would
benefit from being able to save resources it would otherwise have to pour
into its own smp project.
A computation of the profit and loss account over four years for each of the
potential partners came out in IBM's favour.
He believed that software houses - whose application programs can make or
break a hardware supplier - would be more encouraged to write for IBM
designs than for HP.
He was concerned about speculation, however absurd, that Hitachi, the
Japanese electronics giant, might launch a takeover bid for HP. HP licences
its own version of risc to Hitachi, which builds workstations based around
it.
The agreement transforms Bull's credibility but as the Gartner Group points
out, its future is dependent on the delivery of the products. Gartner
believes there is only a 75 per cent chance of success in the symmetrical
multiprocessor development. Michael Armstrong, led final stages of deal for
IBM

<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer company, and Canon, the Japanese office equipment and
camera maker, have joined forces to develop compact personal computers.
The aim of the project is to build portable and small desktop machines that
incorporate a small printer using Canon's bubble-jet technology.
Initially, Canon is to make the computer in Japan for sale under its own
name, and will supply the product to IBM on an original equipment
manufacturer basis. It is to be based on the PS/55 computer made by IBM
Japan and will be available in the 'near future'.
Canon Sales, a subsidiary of Canon, markets IBM computers in Japan. Canon
also supplies bubble-jet printers to IBM on an OEM basis.
The two also plan to develop ties in the field of multi-media devices, which
combine audio, video, computer, or communication functions.
For IBM, the collaboration is the latest in a series of co-operative
arrangements with Japanese companies as part of its new strategy, following
a restructuring last year. IBM is developing flash memory devices -
semiconductor chips which retain memory after power is turned off - jointly
with Toshiba. IBM has also joined forces with Toshiba and Siemens of Germany
to develop technology for the 256 megabit dynamic random access memory chip.
Hitachi and IBM recently agreed to co-operate on printing technology.
IBM is expected to announce today that it is restructuring its personal
computer business, the precursor to a new PC product line to be announced
later this month, analysts said, Reuter reports. A spokesman said IBM would
make an announcement today, but declined to provide details.
The restructuring will turn IBM's PC hardware business into a separate
independent unit responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of
its products in addition to the development and manufacturing it now
controls.

<TEXT>
   Mountain Computer Inc., a closely held Campbell, Calif., maker of tape-drive equipment, said it reached a definitive agreement to be acquired by Nakamichi Corp. of Tokyo for $45 million.

   The transaction, which must be approved by regulatory agencies, would make Mountain a subsidiary of the Japanese tape-drive supplier.

   The acquisition represents major market opportunities for both companies; each has complementary technological capabilities and distribution channels.

   Through Mountain, which currently sells its products through such stores as ComputerLand, Nakamichi gains access to U.S. retail distribution channels.
For Mountain, the move represents a chance to make a strategic alliance with California Peripherals Inc., the Torrance, Calif., original equipment manufacturer that acts as the exclusive distributor for Nakamichi's computer peripheral products.

   Jim Sedin, Mountain's president, decribed the proposed acquisition as "the best possible match for us," giving it access to capital to finance future growth.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Apple, Honeywell in cockpit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Macintosh personal computers will find their way into the cockpits of
commercial aircraft as a result of an agreement reached between Apple and
Honeywell's Commercial Flight Systems Group.
Under the deal, Honeywell will develop an 'electronic library' for use by
flight crews, providing 'multi-media' versions of maintenance and operation
manuals that incorporate video, graphics and sound as well as text.
Honeywell will also make a 'ruggedised' version of Apple's
recently-introduced Macintosh Quadra 800 high-performance PC for the cockpit
information system.
The agreement marks the first time that Apple has licensed its Macintosh
computer technology under such an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement
and signals a new strategy by Apple to broaden the markets for its
technology.
Honeywell said it plans to provide its airline customers with an easy-to-use
information system. The cockpit Macintosh computers will also be able to run
standard PC software.
'This provides airborne software application compatibility with computer
systems on the ground, and should help to incorporate more fully the
aircraft into an airline's overall information management system,' said Mr
Mark Anderson, Honeywell's lead engineer for the ELS project.
The agreement with Honeywell is the first to be reached by a new group
formed at Apple. Called 'New Media/New Markets,' the group will focus on
opportunities created by the convergence of the publishing, entertainment,
telecommunications, computing and consumer electronics businesses, Apple
said.
'Apple believes Macintosh personal computing technology can add great value
outside the realm of the traditional personal computer market,' said Mr Fred
Forsyth, senior vice-president and general manager of the Macintosh Systems
Division.' In particular, Apple is targeting areas such as retail,
automotive, transportation, medical imaging and aviation.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Can Britain make it?: Foreign ownership handicaps
electronics - FT writers make a closer examination of two sectors that have
traditionally been strong, in our series on manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRITISH manufacturing may have declined, but the electronics sector
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
consisting of telecommunications, consumer electronics, information
technology and components - seems in better shape today than it has been for
many years.
The UK now has the fourth largest electronics industry in the world after
the US, Japan and Germany. The industry accounted for about 15 per cent of
the UK's visible exports last year.
A quarter of the large-screen television sets produced in western Europe are
made in Britain and 59 per cent of Europe's personal computer production
comes from the UK and Ireland.
The critical question is whether the health of the sector is sustainable or
a transitory phenomenon which could be slowed or reversed by decisions taken
abroad. US computer maker Digital Equipment's decision to close its computer
manufacturing plant in Galway, Ireland, is a case in point.
Mr John Gardner, managing director of computer maker ICL's UK operations,
points to the difficulty of drawing conclusions in a global business where
manufacturers site production according to market requirements. The Far East
is falling out of favour as European manufacturers improve efficiency.
Transport and distribution costs are lower when production is geographically
close to a company's principal markets, he argues.
The bright spots are dazzling. Applied Materials of the US, one of the
world's largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, carries out
the research and development for its most sophisticated instruments in
Horsham, West Sussex. The Santa Cruz Operation, a leading US software house,
last week bought IXI, a tiny Cambridge company, to acquire IXI's unique
technology.
These examples, however, illustrate the predicament of the UK industry.
Local levels of skill and inventiveness are high but the companies are often
in foreign hands. The trade association for consumer electronics
manufacturers has 16 members but only one is British-owned.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of the UK subsidiary of Digital Equipment, is
convinced the government should do more to encourage home grown market
leaders. 'The UK has always been good at small start-up companies. What we
have not done well is to grow companies able to compete at global level,' he
says.
The result is that Britain's trade deficit in electronics last year was
about Pounds 1.4bn but there are signs of improvement. Last year electronics
exports were 15 per cent smaller than imports. Ten years ago the gap was
twice as large. Some of the improvement is due to recession but the primary
reason is extensive foreign investment.
The most obvious example is consumer electronics, where the deficit is now
only a quarter of the Pounds 1.1bn reached in 1983. Sony started making
television sets in south Wales in the 1970s and inward investment
accelerated in the last decade. Now the list of UK-made Japanese products
includes video recorders from Mitsubishi, compact disc players from Pioneer,
mobile phones from NEC and TV sets from Matsushita and JVC.
Mr Hugh Peltor, director of Brema, the consumer electronics trade
association, says 'We have done well in inward investment.'
The recovery in telecommunications has different origins. The privatisation
of BT created a wave of demand for new equipment and services from BT and
its competitor Mercury in the 1980s. At the same time, the privatisation
freed BT to buy equipment from abroad, hence stimulating competition in the
home market.
In the past couple of years the investment wave has abated, so cutting
imports. But at the same time, UK suppliers - chiefly the part-German owned
GPT and Canada's Northern Telecom - have been sharpened by competitive
pressures.
Now they are waiting for the closed and regulated telecommunications markets
of mainland Europe to follow the UK's liberalised example.
The mainland European markets could offer rich pickings when they are
opened. It is thought that Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is paying two to
three times as much as BT for comparable German equipment in a tightly
regulated market.
Computer software has often been touted as an area where the UK should
excel. The value of computer software and services purchased worldwide will
soon exceed the value of computer hardware.
The industry is dominated by US companies such as Microsoft and Lotus,
however, and there are no signs the position will change.
Nevertheless, the electronics industry gives grounds for modest optimism
although nobody should expect it to become a shooting star in the UK's
economic firmament. The chief concern is its dependence on inward
investment, where fashions may change suddenly and without warning.

SHARP PLANS CHANGES AT IRVINE FIRM;
</P>
<P>
HYCOM IS EXPECTED TO GROW AS COMPANY'S NEW U.S. SALES ARM
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sharp Corp., the Japanese electronics giant, said Wednesday that it has begun
an expansion and major refocusing of its Irvine-based Hycom Inc. research firm.
</P>
<P>
The plan to turn the small operation into Sharp's U.S. sales arm for the
printers and other add-on equipment it sells to major computer manufacturers
ultimately will add dozens of jobs at Hycom headquarters and, Sharp hopes,
boost annual sales in the United States by hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
To run the new sales operation, Hycom has recruited Gregory J. Peel, former
vice president of international sales for Western Digital Corp. in Irvine. As
vice president of sales and marketing, Peel will share responsibility for the
new operation with two longtime Sharp executives recently transferred to Hycom
-- Toru (Ted) Kojima, vice president of operations, and Takehiro Hamanaka,
corporate director and general manager of marketing.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Sharp required U.S. customers for its computer peripherals --
including printers, color scanners, monitors and information storage devices --
to buy directly from Japan. The process created a long pipeline and stunted
Sharp's sales to American computer manufacturers, Peel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In most of its worldwide markets, he said, Sharp's sales are derived almost
equally from consumers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
But Sharp's sales to computer makers, known as original equipment manufacturer,
or OEM, sales, in the United States last year were "negligible" when compared
to the $1.5 billion logged by its U.S. consumer electronics unit in New Jersey,
according to Peel.
</P>
<P>
Peel said that initial plans call for Hycom -- which now has about 30
employees, to add about a dozen people to the sales staff. Further employment
gains, he said, would come with sales growth.
</P>
<P>
That growth could come rather quickly if Sharp is aggressive in its marketing
efforts, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"Sharp has been increasing its role in the laptop computer market and has been
an industry leader in color liquid crystal display technology," said Bill
Lempesis, a computer-industry analyst with Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. The
company's growing reputation as a portable computer maker, he said, could stand
it in good stead in the increasingly competitive OEM market.
</P>
<P>
Sharp officials said in a prepared statement that the company has built a new
factory in Japan solely to provide products for the U.S. OEM market.
</P>
<P>
Peel said that Hycom is expected to outgrow its current facility in Irvine by
late next year but intends to stay in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
Despite its new emphasis on OEM sales, Hycom's original mission of electronics
research and development will not be abandoned, Peel said.
</P>
<P>
The company started in 1972 as a joint venture with a group of U.S. electronics
engineers. Sharp, through its Sharp Microelectronics Technology Inc. subsidiary
in Vancouver, Wash., acquired 100% of the company in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Hycom brought its first commercial product -- an internal modem for personal
computers -- to market earlier this year but has developed display-imaging
systems, advanced computer chips and other products for Sharp and numerous
other clients over the years, Hycom sales manager Jerry Henricks said.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: IBM to market components to
rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is for the first time actively seeking to
sell its semiconductor technology products to outside customers. As part of
the new marketing strategy, it has set an ambitious target of achieving
annual chip sales of Dollars 500m over the next three years.
IBM, the world's largest chip-maker, has until recently consumed internally
all of the output of its large chip plants. Previous sales to third parties
have been modest, occurring mostly in response to specific requests from
customers.
The new semiconductor marketing strategy represents a marked departure from
past practice. It is the latest example of an effort by IBM to raise Dollars
3bn in annual revenues from sales to original equipment manufacturers by
next year.
IBM's entry into the semiconductor market potentially creates a powerful new
competitor for other chip-makers. However, IBM is not expected to compete in
the market for standard commodity chips. Instead, it will focus on 'high
value-added products' in which it has a technological advantage.
Such products include IBM's thermal conduction modules, a core packaging
technology used in its mainframe computers. 'Everything made by the
technology products division, of which the semiconductor operations are a
part, is on the table,' said IBM.
The company is confident that selling a key component to competitors will
not damage its position in the mainframe market. 'Customers don't buy IBM's
mainframes only because of this technology,' it said. Other factors, such as
software, product quality and pricing were distinguishing factors, the
company said.
Excess capacity in semiconductors is one reason for the decision to sell to
third parties. Technological improvements alone have brought annual
production gains of 20 per cent to 30 per cent, the company said. 'We have
reached a point where IBM's internal consumption cannot consume all its
output.'
IBM's entry into the semiconductor market adds a new twist to the ongoing
trade battle between the US and Japan in the computer chip field. Currently,
IBM's sales in Japan are excluded from the US government's preferred method
of calculating the foreign share of the Japanese market. The US has argued
that IBM is a special case because it does not sell to outside customers.
If IBM were included in calculating foreign semiconductor sales in Japan,
the figure could increase by close to 2 percentage points, bringing it to
about 16.5 per cent, much closer to the 20 per cent target at the centre of
the tense trade row.

FT  02 NOV 92 / (CORRECTED) International Capital Markets: Nikon posts 82%
slide in profits

<TEXT>
Correction (published 5th November 1992) appended to this article
NIKON, the leading Japanese camera and precision equipment manufacturer, has
reported operating losses of Y248bn (Dollars 2bn) for the first six months
to September, largely due to a steep fall in sales of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. This compares with operating profits of Y5.39bn a
year earlier.
Pre-tax profits fell by 81.9 per cent to Y1bn, while net profits slid by
73.8 per cent to Y645m. Only the redemption of Y1.1bn of dollar denominated
bonds allowed the company to record pre-tax profits.
Nikon's turnover fell by 14.7 per cent to Y104,273bn. However, sales of
semiconductor equipment, which last year accounted for a third of the
company's sales, fell by almost 50 per cent to Y19bn in the six months from
Y37bn.
Sales of cameras fell to Y48bn from Y51bn. Only sales of spectacle lenses,
frames, sunglasses and binoculars increased, to Y16bn from Y13bn.
Nikon hopes to contain its operating deficit for the year to March to about
Y2.5bn, with cost savings in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment
division.
Nikon declared an unchanged interim dividend of Y4.50.
CORRECTION
Nikon announced operating losses of Y2.48bn (dollars 20.3m) on sales
of Y104.27bn for the six months to September 30. These figures were
incorrectly reported in the FT on November 2.

   Wang Laboratories Inc., in a retreat from its longtime
effort to be a major computer designer and manufacturer, said
it will sell computers made by archrival International
Business Machines Corp.
   Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., said the change will mean
"significant restructuring charges" for its year ending June
30. It will also mean substantial further layoffs at Wang as
the company reduces its manufacturing and development of
computer hardware and focuses on office software, analysts
and consultants said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, the IBM relationship may give Wang credibility
with customers at a time when sales of its own computers have
steadily weakened, revenue is shrinking and losses have been
continuing.
   In an action that helped cement what the two companies
called a "strategic business relationship," IBM will make a
$25 million investment in Wang to buy convertible securities
that could be converted into a 3% or 4% stake in Wang's Class
B stock. It may also make further investments of as much as
$75 million, depending on Wang's performance. The companies
declined to be more specific about the terms of the
agreement.
   The agreement will give IBM a leg up in selling its
computers to customers who are already defecting from Wang,
and will further IBM'S defensive push into the
original-equipment-manufacturer marketplace. Not only does
such business take IBM's products to customers its sales
force hasn't been able to reach, it also soaks up some of
IBM's excess manufacturing capacity. And the accord will keep
Wang from signing a similar agreement with a competitor.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Wang Labs
Class B stock rose 50 cents to close at $4.375 a share. IBM
stock was quoted at $100.875 a share, up $1.375, in late New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   "This is a radical change in Wang's business strategy,"
said Barry Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. He added that Wang's financial results will be "under
pressure" while employees and customers evaluate the new
structure.
   Wang's chairman and chief executive officer, Richard
Miller, said that "within the next few weeks, we'll be
articulating our business plan." He said the company has
various business structures under consideration, but he
declined to discuss any layoffs, charges or forecasts of
financial results.
   Under the new business plan, Wang will focus on its
strategy of developing office-automation and
document-management software for business and government
offices. Although it will continue to make and sell its
proprietary VS midrange computer line, many of its
development and sales efforts will be focused on the IBM
hardware.
   Some observers said Wang has embarked on a high-risk
strategy. "Miller has decided to pivot the company to be a
big software player. The problem is, he has about a year to
do it," said John McCarthy of market researcher Forrester
Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass. Because Wang has to quickly
produce new software products, "The margin for error in this
transition is nil. He has his feet on a tightrope and his
head in a noose," said Mr. McCarthy.
   Rumors of big changes at Wang have been flying in recent
days, because observers expect the company to report
continued revenue declines and a net loss for the fiscal year
ending June 30. In fiscal 1990, Wang reported a net loss of
$715.9 million, including restructuring charges of $338.3
million. Revenue last year was $2.5 billion.
   Under its agreement with IBM, Wang will sell the Armonk,
N.Y., company's personal computers and RS/6000 workstations
under its own label. Wang said it hasn't decided whether to
continue making its own PC. The plan to use the RS/6000
throws doubt on Wang's six-month-old agreement to buy
workstations from Mips Computer Systems Inc., Sunnyvale,
Calif. A Mips spokeswoman declined comment.
   Wang will also include IBM's proprietary AS/400
minicomputer in its product line -- under an IBM label -- and
make it easy for customers to convert their software from the
VS line to the AS/400. Wang said it will continue to upgrade
its VS line this year, but analysts said many customers are
likely to be skeptical of the line's outlook.
   The relationship with IBM is a wrenching change for Wang,
which a decade ago was competing toe-to-toe with IBM for
dominance in the office. In recent years Wang's
word-processors have been replaced by IBM-compatible PCs,
sales have plunged, and a cash crunch two years ago led to
management upheaval. Three years ago, Wang had annual revenue
of $3 billion and employed 31,500. This year revenue will be
closer to $2 billion, and at the end of March the company had
just 17,500 workers.
   Despite all the changes in recent years, the new pact is
likely to worry employees even more. "The question is, will
Wang survive as a professional-services, integration and
software company?" says Thomas Willmott, a consultant with
Aberdeen Group, Boston.
   Terry Lautenbach, a senior vice president who heads IBM's
U.S. operations, said yesterday that IBM will receive a
"substantial" revenue boost from the Wang deal. But in an
interview, another IBM executive said the benefit probably
won't be felt until 1992, citing the training period required
for Wang to start selling IBM machines.
   The Wang-IBM linkup "won't be off to a roaring start in
1991," said William Grabe, who oversees IBM's marketing and
services in the U.S. Mr. Grabe added that the initial revenue
kick will likely come from Wang customers choosing to move
over to the AS/400 minicomputer, while the boost from extra
sales of RS/6000 workstations and PS/2 personal computers
will come only after Wang's software plans for those machines
have been finalized.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. said errors in predicting demand for its product lines depressed earnings significantly below analysts' expectations for the second consecutive quarter.

   The Palo Alto, Calif., maker of computers and scientific instruments estimated that per-share net income for the third quarter ended July 31 was 11% to 16% less than what most analysts had anticipated.

   The company expects to report Thursday that per-share net was, at best, flat at 75 cents to 80 cents, compared with analysts' expectations of as much as 95 cents.
A year earlier, net was $192 million, or 80 cents a share, on revenue of $2.4 billion.

   The company said both domestic and international orders for its products continue to show "good" year-to-year growth.
But it said "revenues will fall below expectations because of continuing difficulties in adjusting shipment plans to match the changing mix of its business."

   The announcement, which drove Hewlett-Packard's stock down nearly 5% on heavy volume, was generally a less-shocking replay of glitches in the second-quarter.
The company refused to elaborate on its difficulties, but said it had imposed expense and hiring controls as a means of improving its profitability.

   Computer makers generally have had trouble attempting to forecast demand for their products.
As the time it takes to bring a new product to market is shortening, computer makers are increasingly buffeted by their own inability to quickly manufacture new products, or by customer fears that the introduction of a better, cheaper machine is just around the corner.

   The challenge has been compounded because Hewlett-Packard and many other companies have been maintaining ever-leaner product inventories in an attempt to hold down costs.
Such policies have tended to make quarterly earnings reports more volatile, however.

   Analysts speculated that, as in the second quarter, Hewlett-Packard had unexpected demand for such "low-end" products as personal computers, printers and workstations, while orders for its commercial computers and instruments failed to meet forecasts.
While some analysts said the miscue didn't alter their fundamental view of the company, it has raised eyebrows.

   "After two quarters it becomes kind of a question mark" as to why Hewlett can't ship more on the low-end, said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
"These are products that basically use standard parts."

   A spokeswoman said the lower-than-expected earnings was unrelated to the company's $476.4 million purchase in May of Apollo Computer Inc., a major manufacturer of workstations, which are desk-top computers widely used by scientists and engineers.
The company previously said costs from the acquisition would depress per-share earnings 10 cents to 15 cents in the latest period.

   While Hewlett-Packard's workstation business appears strong for the moment, there is some concern that the company has underestimated the challenge of taking over Apollo.
Some analysts said the company has confused customers by not making it clear which computers it will continue to offer in the future.
"There's tremendous overlap" between the two companies' workstation products, said Vicki Brown, an analyst with International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass.
"I think they underestimated the amount of work it will take" to make this acquisition successful.

   In this year's second quarter, profit was $203 million, or 86 cents a share, on revenue of $2.86 billion.
That profit was 21% below what some analysts had predicted.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Hewlett-Packard stock fell $2.50 to close yesterday at $52.75 a share.

   Separately, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens AG and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Microelectronics unit announced an agreement for international multisourcing of key fiber-optic parts.
The companies said they agreed on a common transceiver with interchangeable parts that will comply with Fiber Distributed Data Interface standards for computer networking.
The transceivers provide transmission of optical signals over fiber.

   The companies said their pact will assure original equipment manufacturers of reliable sources of standardized products, and advance the development of an emerging industry standard for fiber-optic parts.
Samples of the three companies' transceivers are slated to become available this fall.

   NEW YORK -- Hopes of lower interest rates rekindled
over-the-counter stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rebounded 6.78 to 468.18, a
1.5% jump, outpacing the 1% gain in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index and the 1.1% advance in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. OTC volume edged up to 162.9
million shares from 162.5 million Tuesday. Advancing stocks
outpaced decliners, 1,155 to 763, as 75 issues reached new
highs and 12 dropped to new lows.

   "People with cash are looking for an opportunity to step
in and buy stocks" after the nearly 3% combined fall in
smaller issues on Monday and Tuesday, said Ralph Costanza,
head of OTC trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan encouraged investors
when he told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee there
is more room now than in recent months to lower interest
rates to spur economic growth.
   Some of the OTC market's largest shares moved it higher.
Microsoft, the largest OTC issue, rebounded 4 3/4 to 100 1/2.
William Gates III, chairman of the software maker, told this
newspaper a Federal Trade Commission inquiry is narrowly
focused and isn't a broad scrutiny of the company's
competitive practices. Apple Computer surged 3 3/8 to 66 1/4
and Sun Microsystems added 1 to 32 1/4.
   Intel, the OTC's largest semiconductor stock and the day's
most active issue, rebounded 2 3/8 to 47 5/8 on more than 3.5
million shares. The semiconductor industry's leading
indicator, the book-to-bill ratio, jumped in February amid a
surge of orders from buyers who had delayed purchases until
the outcome of the Persian Gulf war was certain. The
increased orders continued to pull the industry out of a long
slump triggered by fears of war and recession.
   Health-care stocks rebounded as several were lifted by
bullish analysts' comments. U.S. Healthcare vaulted 4 to 43
3/8 and United Healthcare gained 1 5/8 to 32 5/8 after
Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Mimi Willard repeated her
"buy" investment opinions on both health maintenance
organizations. Ms. Willard told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report that the 1992 outlook for HMO pricing looks
firm, based on her expectations for private insurers.
   Genetics Institute rebounded 3 1/8 to 43. Several analysts
recommended purchase of the battered biotechnology stock
after the company said Tuesday that it will take a one-time
charge of $18.3 million to reflect the cost of its patent
battle with Amgen and possible losses related to its 4.9%
investment in NeoRx Corp. Analysts at Shearson, Prudential
Securities Inc. and Oppenheimer &amp; Co. all recommended the
stock, but First Boston analyst Amy Berler said she's still
concerned about the company's outlook and is "neutral" on the
stock. Amgen soared 6 to 123.
   Mentor jumped 1 7/8 to a new 52-week high of 25. Tuesday,
rival Collagen said that the Food and Drug Administration had
asked for more data on its injectable treatment for urinary
incontinence. Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Neal Bradsher advised
clients that he expects Mentor to beat Collagen in a race to
win FDA approval of a similar product. Collagen fell 3/4 to
26 3/4.
   Shares of companies involved in video conferencing fared
well. PictureTel rose 1 1/2 to 21 3/4. Siemens Private
Communications Systems, a subsidiary of Siemens AG, said it
formed alliances with PictureTel and another concern to make
lower-cost video conferencing available to its world-wide PBX
customers.
   Compression Labs, which also is in the video conferencing
business, gained 2 1/8 to 19 5/8. On Tuesday, the San Jose,
Calif., company said that it will market world-wide a
conferencing system made by Data Beam Corp.
   Quantum added 5/8 to 25 3/8. The Milipitas, Calif., disk
drive maker said that it updated its ProDrive Series products
to include a feature that improves data transmission rates.
Separately, Quantum said that it entered into an
original-equipment manufacturing ageement with a subsidiary
of Philips N.V. for certain products.
   BE Avionics jumped 1 3/4 to 12 1/4. The Santa Ana, Calif.,
maker of airline audio and video control systems said that it
received a $3 million order from an unidentified
international airline for a video system and an expanded
order from another airline, which increases the value of that
order to $9 million from $5.2 million.
   Investors were quick to sell the stocks of companies that
warned of weak earnings, said Robert C. King, head of OTC
trading in Atlanta for Robinson-Humphrey Co. Both
institutions and individual investors also continued to take
profits in stocks that charged ahead in January and February.
Despite the market's rise, Mr. King said that he saw more
"sell" orders than "buy" orders yesterday.
   Sonoco Products skidded 1 7/8 to 36 5/8. The Hartsville,
S.C., industrial paper products concern said that it will
report lower earnings for the first quarter because of the
weak economy, but it didn't release an earnings estimate. A
year earlier, Sonoco had net income of 57 cents a share.
   Homestyle Buffet slipped 1/8 to 6 1/2 after trading as low
as 5. The Oldsmar, Fla., restaurant chain reported a loss of
nine cents a share for the fourth quarter, including a charge
of 12 cents a share due primarily to the closing of an
unprofitable restaurant. A year earlier, Homestyle had net
income of seven cents a share. Sales rose to $10.3 million
from more than $5.9 million a year earlier.
   Inacomp Computer Centers slid 3/8 to 6 7/8. Late Tuesday,
the Troy, Mich., computer retailer reported that net income
for the second quarter, ended Jan. 26, fell to 20 cents a
share from 30 cents a year ago.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Chip makers' protection spells buyers'
burden - EC officials seeking tariff cuts are caught in the middle of a
bitter debate

TRADE officials in Brussels negotiating with the rest of the world to reduce
tariffs are finding themselves in the middle of a bitter debate between
Europe's semiconductor makers and its users - and both sides claim the
outcome could make or break Europe's electronics industry.
During the current round of multilateral talks on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the EC has offered to lower import tariffs on various
goods by 30 per cent. This offer would apply to the existing 14 per cent
import duty on semiconductors. Whether EC negotiators will keep the offer on
the table depends on how the talks go.
After years of struggling to hold their own, European semiconductor
manufacturers believe a tariff reduction is certain to accelerate the steady
fall in their share of the European market.
Even with the tariff in effect, that share has fallen from 45 per cent in
1978 to about 39 per cent in 1990 and 38 per cent last year, according to
Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy.
US manufacturers together control about 42 per cent of the European market,
while Far Eastern manufacturers have increased their share steadily.
A tariff reduction would be 'one more step towards a very bad situation and
eventually to the industry disappearing altogether', says Mr Klaus
Brinkmann, chairman of the semiconductor working group of the European
Electronic Components Association.
He argues that the semiconductor industry is a key industry on which all
other industries depend. 'Without semiconductors Europe has no industrial
future,' says Mr Brinkmann.
The EC has been the last remaining economy with a tariff on semiconductors
after the US, Japan and Canada suspended their tariffs in 1985.
The elimination of tariffs on semiconductors in Europe 'is among the top
priorities for the Gatt round,' says the Semiconductor Industry Association,
the trade body in the US.
At the same time semiconductor users in Europe are fighting just as
vehemently for the tariff's removal. Either the tariff, which protects
semiconductor manufacturers at the expense of equipment manufacturers, goes
or equipment manufacturers themselves will have to leave Europe, they say.
Olivetti, the Italian computer and office equipment group, for example, has
already moved production of some low-end PCs to Singapore and could move
more production there, according to Mr Bruno Lamborghini, head of Olivetti's
EC liaison office. 'We cannot wait too long,' he says. 'We have to take a
decision.'
'We need zero tariffs,' he says. 'I don't see why we have to support an
industry that cannot compete.'
The semiconductor industry has always claimed that the high costs of
manufacturing in Europe - over 20 per cent more than in the US or Japan - is
due to high labour and capital costs which they have no control over. A
tariff is needed to create a 'level playing field' with their competitors.
Semiconductor users in Europe, in particular the information technology and
telecommunications manufacturers, counter that they are faced with the same
high costs of manufacturing in Europe.
Eurobit, the association of European business machine manufacturers and the
information technology industry, points out that the semiconductor tariff
places the equipment manufacturers at a disadvantage since the level of
tariffs on imported electronic equipment - generally between 4 and 7 per
cent - is lower than the tariff on semiconductors.
This means, in effect, that equipment manufacturers carry the cost of the
higher level of protection provided to the semiconductor industry.
'To create an artificial market is to spell death for the electronics
industry,' Mr Lamborghini says.
He suggests that European semiconductor manufacturers stop trying to compete
in areas where they clearly are not competitive and concentrate their
efforts on areas where they have strength, such as custom chips. If they are
really competitive in these areas they will be able to hold their own even
without the protective tariff.
Both the US and Japan are seeking suspension of the 14 per cent tariff. The
SIA warns that some form of retaliation is not ruled out entirely.
'Depending on what comes out of the Gatt talks, anything is possible.'
The EECA admits that the timing constraints of the Uruguay Round means that
the EC is unlikely to be able to make an exception for the semiconductor
industry.
The options the industry is left with are to continue pushing for an
integrated EC policy on electronics while seeking better access to export
markets such as Japan. But most important, perhaps, it needs to shape up to
meet the impending reality of a less cosy home market.

ARCHIVE CORP. TO TRIM 108 CIPHER JOBS IN SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Archive Corp., the data storage products maker that merged in April with rival
Cipher Data Products Inc., said Monday it will lay off 108 employees in San
Diego and reorganize itself into six new business units.
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which will only affect employees at Cipher's headquarters in San
Diego, represent a 3% reduction in Archive's 3,300-employee work force. Before
the merger, Archive had about 1,600 employees and Cipher had 1,700.
</P>
<P>
Archive, based in Costa Mesa, said the job cuts are the result of a reduced
demand for Cipher's products, a need to eliminate duplication after the two
firms' corporate staffs were merged and a transfer of some manufacturing to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
After a three-month hostile takeover battle, Cipher Data finally agreed in
April to be acquired by Archive for $123 million. Several top Cipher
executives, including Chairman Gary Liebl, resigned from the company in late
April.
</P>
<P>
Under the realignment, manufacturing will be consolidated at two plants in
Singapore and corporate finance and administration will be combined in Costa
Mesa. Employees in Costa Mesa will not be affected by the layoffs, said B.J.
Rone, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
"This is the new Archive, the final plan for our merged company," Rone said.
"We haven't made any decisions about one division, (Cipher's Optimem), but this
is the only reorganization and only layoffs we expect."
</P>
<P>
Allen Strand, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles,
said the layoff was expected and that further consolidations may follow.
</P>
<P>
Archive and Cipher both make tape drives that serve as backup storage systems
to prevent the loss of data stored in computer hard disk drives in the event of
system crashes or natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The merged company will realign itself into six units distinguished by separate
technologies and markets. The changes in the company operations are as follows:
</P>
<P>
* Archive's original equipment manufacturing products division will make 5
1/4-inch tape drives under both the Archive and Cipher brands. Cipher's San
Diego unit will shift its manufacturing overseas and some employees will be
transferred to Archive's plant in Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
* Cipher in San Diego will focus exclusively on its original core business of
making half-inch tape drives for minicomputers. Craig Turner, a longtime Cipher
employee, will serve as the division's president.
</P>
<P>
* Cipher's Irwin Magnetic Systems, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., will concentrate
on the design and marketing of quarter-inch mini-cartridges and 3 1/2-inch form
factor tape drives and tape backup subsystems. Ed Carlson will be president of
Irwin. Herb Amster, a founder of Irwin, will move to the Archive corporate
staff as senior vice president of corporate development.
</P>
<P>
* The tape drive manufacturing operations of both Archive and Cipher will be
consolidated in Singapore under the supervision of Jess Parker, senior vice
president of operations for Archive.
