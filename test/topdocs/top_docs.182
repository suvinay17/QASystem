<HEAD>DOT Rules Logan Airport Landing Fee Plan Discriminatory, Court
Fight Vowed</HEAD>

   The operators of Logan International Airport
are vowing to challenge in court a government order that rejects a
new landing fee system designed to cut traffic at the congested
Boston airfield by discouraging small planes.
   The Transportation Department ruled Thursday that Logan's landing
fee structure, which had been closely watched by the aviation
community as a possible national precedent, was unreasonable,
discriminatory and in violation of federal law.
   Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi Weyforth Dawson signed an
order that gives the Massachusetts Port Authority seven days to
rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $10.2 million in
federal aviation improvement grants for the current fiscal year.
   MassPort officials immediately attacked the ruling.
   ``It sounds like the Department of Transportation has really just
given in to political pressure from powerful special interest groups
and turned its back on millions of air travelers in New England and
throughout the nation,'' said Thomas Champion, assistant to the
executive director at MassPort.
   But opponents of the Logan plan hailed the ruling as a victory
for commuter air passengers, private plane pilots and small-town
America.
   ``This is a tremendous victory for greater public access to our
major airports,'' said Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., author of the
law that authorized the cutoff of federal funds to Logan if the
Transportation Department agreed that the landing fees were unfair.
   Operators of other major airports, including those in Los
Angeles, Denver and Minneapolis, were awaiting the decision to see
if the stiff fee structure could be used as a model in their own
battles to reduce air traffic, said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert,
R-N.Y., a leading congressional opponent of the landing fee plan.
   Small commuter airlines and private plane owners vehemently
fought against the proposal, saying it would lock them out of Logan
and deprive air service to passengers in small communities where
there is no access to major airlines.
   Under Logan's revised fee structure, large jets are paying
significantly less than before, while small aircraft had their
landing fees increase from $25 to more than $100.
   Logan officials defended the new fee structure, which went into
effect in July after a federal district judge in Boston ruled that
the fees were not discriminatory.
   Champion said the landing fee plan had succeeded in reducing
congestion at Logan, which is the largest airport in New England,
and that access had not been restricted for commuters.
   The new fee structure was based on a combination of airplanes'
weight and other operating costs.
   The original fee rate charged planes a minimum of $25 or $1.31
per 1,000 pounds, which ever was greater. Most small planes paid
$25. Under the revised fee structure, which was increased again in
October, all planes are assessed a $103 flat fee plus 55 cents per
1,000 pounds.
   MassPort Executive Director David W. Davis said fees for a Boeing
747, which had ranged up to $800, have been cut roughly in half
under the new fee structure while the landing fee for a Cessna 402
seating 10 passengers jumped from $25 to about $105.

   A decision to boost landing fees for smaller planes at Logan International Airport while slashing them for commercial jetliners is setting the stage for a battle that could affect air travelers throughout the country. 

   The goal of the Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns busy Logan, was simple: to cut delays by inducing commuter airlines and private pilots to switch to bigger planes or better yet to other airports in the Boston area. 
Now Massport is considering other pricing and reservation plans that would give bigger planes preference during rush hours. 

   Supporters laud Massport's moves -- called PACE, or Program for Airport Capacity Efficiency -- as innovative and practical. 
"Where you have this kind of congestion, this is rational," says Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. 
"It's not economically sensible for a plane that lands two people to be on equal footing with one that lands 250." 

   Others disagree. 
"Massport," says Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican who represents central New York, "is thumbing its nose at the little guys." 
What's worse, he says, "Other airports can't wait to do the same thing." 

   In many ways, the Massport controversy is a microcosm of national aviation issues. 
It pits those who believe all planes should be treated the same against those who say big jetliners deserve preference. 
It divides those who believe the airport crunch must be solved by building new runways from those who argue that airport space is limited and should be rationed. 
Like all wrangling over airports, it's a noisy, nasty fight. 

   "Massport has taken a very selfish, narrow perspective," asserts John Baker, president of the politically powerful Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the trade group for private pilots. 
"They treat Logan as a proprietary interest, without a national role, even though they have accepted millions in federal funds." 

   Prodding by Mr. Baker and others, including the Regional Airline Association, which represents commuter airlines, and the National Business Aircraft Association, which represents corporations that own planes, may pay off. 
The U.S. Transportation Department is investigating whether Massport is violating federal law, and Congress is considering denying it $11 million in federal funds. 

   For Massport executive director David Davis, all the fuss obscures a simple issue: Logan, which is expected to handle 37 million passengers annually by the year 2000, up from 23 million last year, will become hopelessly gridlocked without changes. 

   "Airport efficiency," he says, "must be measured by the number of people -- not planes -- who can use the airport with a minimum of delay." 
He predicts the new fee schedule will cut traffic 5%, resulting in a 40% decrease in rush-hour delays. 

   But critics argue that Massport's actions will set an undesirable precedent. 
"If other big airports do the same thing, we'll end up with two dozen mini-CABs {Civil Aeronautics Boards}" deciding who can fly and in what kind of plane, warns Jonathan Howe, president of the business-aircraft group. 
The result, says John Sullivan, president of Brockway Air Inc., a South Burlington, Vt., commuter carrier, will be a "checkerboard of reregulation." 

   Some Massport critics also worry about the prospect of a Dukakis administration. 
The Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor has said he would order Massport-type plans for other congested airports. 
Mr. Davis has been mentioned as a potential Federal Aviation Administration chief. 

   Certainly, Logan's new landing fees have drastically changed the costs of doing business at the airport. 
A Cessna 402, for example, is charged $95.19 to land, up from $25 before July 1, while a Boeing 747-300 is billed $432.51, down from $823.99. 

   For Business Express of Hartford, Conn., a commuter airline affiliated with Delta Air Lines, landing fees at Logan will triple to $1 million a year. 
By contrast, Delta, because it uses big jets, expects to save $1.2 million a year. 

   James McManus, president of Business Express, says the higher fees contributed to a decision to end service between Logan and Augusta, Maine, and may force him to raise fares. 
Precision Airlines, a commuter airline based in Manchester, N.H., has raised fares $8 on all its flights to offset an increase in landing fees. 

   Massport plans to exempt some flights serving smaller communities from the landing-fee increases, but New England lawmakers say the exemptions won't be extensive enough to protect many rural areas from fare increases and service cutbacks. 
They want Massport to drop PACE and consider a new runway for small planes. 
That's an option Massport has rejected for reasons of noise and politics. 

   It's too soon to tell what impact PACE is having on delays, and in any case, the final judgment will be made by the courts and the federal government. 
Groups representing commuter airlines and private pilots are appealing a June ruling by a federal district judge in Boston that upheld the fee changes. 

   Meanwhile, the Senate has voted to deny Massport federal funds if the Transportation Department rules against it and Massport refuses to suspend PACE. 
The provision was written by Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), who contends Logan is being run like a "medieval fiefdom" and that his constituents will be hurt. 

   Rep. Frank is unmoved. 
"In New Hampshire, they're always making a big deal about how wonderful it is to do business there because the taxes are so low," he says, "but that's because of publicly supported places in Massachusetts like Logan."

<HEAD>Federal Judge Permits Fee Hike For Small Planes At Logan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday ruled that dramatic
increases in landing fees for small aircraft at Logan International
Airport are not discriminatory and can be implemented as planned on
Friday.
   The Massachusetts Port Authority, the independent agency that
runs the airport, had announced the new fees in March to reduce
airport congestion by encouraging small planes to use suburban
airfields.
   ``The objectives of the airport to reduce delays are rationally
related to government interests,'' U.S. District Judge A. David
Mazzone said. ``I cannot say that the assignment (of the fees) was
an arbitrary, irrational, non-uniform assignment.''
   Lawyers representing owners of small aircraft and commuter
airlines said they had not decided whether to appeal.
   The New England Legal Foundation, a non-profit organization
specializing in government regulation of business, had argued that
the fee increase violates laws requiring equal access to federally
supported airports. They also alleged the fees violate
constitutional guarantees against discrimination.
   Wayne Henderson, a lawyer for the foundation, said he was
``obviously disappointed ... but it's a close call as the judge
said.''
   The fees are based on a combination of airplanes' weight and
other operating costs. While fees for large jets actually would go
down, fliers of smaller aircraft would pay as much as 250 percent
more.
   Under the new fees, all planes at Logan will be assessed an $88
flat fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. Currently, planes are
assessed $1.31 per 1,000 pounds or $25, whichever is greater. Most
small planes pay $25.
   The fee for a Boeing 747 would drop to $408 from $680, while a
Cessna 402 seating 10 passengers will pay $96 compared to the
current $25.
   The legal foundation represented commuter airlines in the New
England area. Also appearing in court were lawyers for the National
Business Aircraft Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association.
   The landing fees were approved after a crowded, highly charged
hearing. Among those applauding the increase were residents living
next to the airport, who see it as a way to reduce noise and the
potential for accidents.
   Logan averages 90 takeoffs and landings an hour, according to
MassPort. The Federal Aviation Administration ranks Logan among the
nation's 10 most congested airports.
   MassPort executive director David Davis called the decision a
ruling of national importance. ``It's a larger victory because the
judge supported the position of the authority's right'' to set
fees, he said.
   In a related development, the U.S. House on Tuesday removed
provisions in a $10.8 billion spending package for federal
transportation that might have blocked federal aid to Logan because
of the new fees.
   Opponents of the fee hike had inserted a provision to withhold
money from Logan until the U.S. Transportation Department finishes
investigating Massport's plan and the court ruled. The DOT review
is not due until November.
   The provision was deleted after Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
D-Mass., complained it had no place in a spending bill. The bill
passed the House and went to the Senate. Similar provisions
blocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate version.

   A Boston effort to relieve runway congestion
by increasing landing fees for small planes is evolving into a
national debate over the role of major airports.
   What was a local dispute involving Logan International Airport
has spilled over to Congress, the Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' said Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who has introduced legislation designed
to block Logan from implementing the plan. ``There are airports all
over the country sort of foaming at the mouth, just waiting to
follow suit.''
   But Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that ``deteriorating
air traffic gridlock'' justifies Logan's goal of encouraging small
aircraft to use other airfields in the area, saying, ``It's a
balancing of equities.''
   Logan faces a problem common to many airports: Air traffic and
delays are growing, but expansion is unrealistic because of
neighborhood opposition, a lack of available land and enormous
construction costs.
   So the Massachusetts Port Authority, or Massport, the state
agency that operates Logan, has announced a plan it says will
permit more efficient use of the airport by 23 million passengers
annually.
   As of July 1, landing fees for private planes and commuter
airlines will be increased from the current minimum of $25 to an
average of close to $100. The costs for large airliners _ now
hundreds of dollars _ will drop by varying amounts.
   ``Massport has concluded that the test of efficiency at Logan is
not the number of airplanes landed per hour, but the number of
people handled per hour with a minimum of delay,'' the agency's
executive director, David W. Davis, said when the plan was approved
March 16. ``In other words, a 747 with 400 people on board deserves
a higher priority than a Cessna with two people on board.''
   The commuter airline, corporate aircraft and private plane
industries say the Logan plan is unfair because they have as much
right to use the government-supported airport as airlines do. And
the higher fees will hurt their businesses, they say.
   ``We price our service at what we think the market will stand,''
said John Fredericksen, executive vice president of the Regional
Airline Association, which represents the nation's commuter
carriers. ``If we thought that extra money was out there, we'd
charge it.''
   Officials of the small plane industry fear that Logan's plan may
be only the beginning of restrictions across the country.
   Although air traffic grows every year, the last major U.S.
metropolitan airport _ Dallas-Fort Worth International _ was
completed in 1974. No new airports are under construction, although
two cities _ Denver and Austin _ are moving toward building new
ones, and about a dozen others hope to add runways at existing
airfields.
   Since new airports take at least four years to build _ and cost
$1.5 billion to $2 billion _ existing fields are moving to make
better use of what they have. Modern air traffic equipment will
allow more frequent takeoffs and landings, but it is expensive and
in many cases needs further development.
   As delays grow, more airfields are considering shunting some of
their small plane traffic elsewhere by raising fees, particularly
during busy morning and evening hours.
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports, is expected in
September to impose slight rush hour increases in takeoff fees for
small planes.
   Massport spokesman Tom Champion declined to name airports that
have contacted his agency but conceded, ``There are a lot of people
watching us with great interest.''
   Said Fredericksen of the regional airline group, ``Our concern
is that airports will try to limit traffic, rather than expand
capacity.''
   Boehlert's bill, and an identical Senate version co-sponsored by
seven Northeastern lawmakers, face uncertain futures. The 1988
congressional schedule is a short one, and committee chairmen say
they have not decided whether to even hold hearings for the
legislation.
   But Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a private plane pilot, said he will
try attaching an amendment to a spending bill this month that would
kill the Logan plan and discourage other airports from adopting
similar restrictions.
   ``This is a national airspace system, and here we have one
airport trying to make policy,'' he said.
   Opponents of the Logan program have opened other fronts. Small
plane industry groups have filed federal lawsuits in Boston and
also have asked the FAA and Transportation Department to step in on
their behalf.
   Supporters of Logan's efforts say, however, that similar plans
are inevitable.
   ``It's the wave of the future,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``As the skies get more crowded, rational pricing policies
will be imposed at other airports, and Logan is blazing the trail.''

   The Transportation Department and the Massachusetts Port Authority are headed for a showdown in a case that holds major implications for the way airports handle air-traffic congestion. 

   On Friday, Transportation Secretary James Burnley opened an investigation into a new landing-fee schedule for Boston's Logan International Airport. 
He asked the port authority to delay implementing the new schedule, which is due to go into effect July 1, until after the investigation is completed, probably by mid-November. 

   But Tom Champion, assistant to port authority chief David Davis, said the local agency will likely refuse the department's request. 
"Everything we know tells us it will be a significant benefit to New England travelers during the summer travel season," he said. 

   Currently, landing fees at Logan, and other airports throughout the U.S., are determined by an aircraft's weight, so that big planes pay substantially more than smaller ones. 
But Logan, like other big airports, is congested, and the port authority decided to try to reduce the crowding by encouraging smaller planes to land elsewhere. 
To that end, its new fee schedule is based on a flat landing fee per aircraft, plus an additional charge based on weight. 
The effect will be to reduce fees for big planes and increase them for small planes. 

   For example, the fee for a Boeing 727 would drop to about $160 per landing from the current $200. 
A nine-passenger Cessna 402, which currently pays about $25 to land, would pay about $91 under the new schedule. 
If the Logan scheme is successful, some other airports undoubtedly will take similar steps. 

   The port authority estimates that the new fee schedule will reduce Logan traffic by 5% almost immediately, as some small-plane pilots switch to smaller local or regional airports. 
The authority predicts that over time some commuter lines will move to using bigger planes. 

   But critics contend that the plan violates rules barring airports that receive federal funds from treating different classes of aircraft in an unfair or discriminatory way. 
Mr. Burnley's order, in which he said there were "reasonable grounds" for an investigation, is a big boost for three groups that have filed complaints with the department: the National Business Aircraft Association, which represents companies operating corporate jets, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents private pilots, and the Regional Aircraft Association, which represents commuter airlines. 

   Meanwhile, some of the aviation groups and some regional business groups have sued the port authority in federal court in Boston. 
The judge in the case has pledged to give the matter speedy consideration, but it isn't clear what effect the department's action will have on the lawsuit. 

   The dispute also has split the New England congressional delegation; a number of lawmakers from states such as Maine and Vermont are critical of the new fee schedule, fearing it will hurt commuter airlines, while many Massachusetts representatives support it. 

   In any case, port authority officials argue that their plan won't discriminate against smaller planes, but simply end what amounts to a landing-fee subsidy by larger planes. 
They add that, as airports throughout the U.S. become increasingly crowded, airport officials will have to figure out a way to keep traffic at a manageable level.

   Two airplanes want to land at Boston's congested Logan International Airport at 8:30 on a weekday morning. 
One carries 200 Cub Scouts on their way to a weekend outing, the other holds two corporate CEOs heading for a crucial early morning meeting. 

   Which plane should get landing priority? 

   Under a controversial plan being floated by the Massachusetts Port Authority, operator of Logan, the scouts would get the nod. 
Even as the courts and the federal Department of Transportation review Logan's already implemented hike in landing fees for smaller planes, Massport is considering a second phase of its Program for Airport Capacity Efficiency, or PACE, that would give first call on landings and takeoffs during peak travel periods to large-capacity carriers. 

   "Airport capacity is a valuable resource which should be managed to promote the greatest level of efficiency as measured by the movement of people, not airplanes," says Massport Executive Director David Davis. 

   There's no question Logan has an overcrowding problem. 
The airport accommodated more than 23 million passengers in fiscal 1987, a 101% increase from 1976. 
The Federal Aviation Administration projects passenger demand will double again by 2010. 
But its congestion problems are only somewhat worse than those facing many of the nation's airports. 

   In PACE's second phase, Massport proposes dividing aircraft into eight groups: those with more than 300 seats, such as the 747; those carrying 225 to 300 seats, such as the L-1011 or DC-10, and so on down to airplanes with capacities of 30 or less. 
In all, 85% of Logan's capacity during peak hours would be assigned according to size. 
Remaining space for takeoffs and landings would be auctioned off to the high bidders. 

   This "priority reservation" system would in theory apply only to the rush hour periods of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. 
But as Mr. Davis noted in a recent speech, "any hour when scheduled operations exceed" the optimal aircraft flow "would be classified as a peak hour," raising the prospect of far-reaching access restrictions if Logan traffic continues to grow. 

   Even the staunchest advocates of deregulation support Massport's overall efforts to better manage Logan traffic. 
Former Civil Aeronautics Board chairman and deregulation godfather Alfred Kahn calls the PACE Phase One fee hikes "a large step in the right direction." 

   But to Mr. Kahn and other critics, Phase Two is a silly idea that tries to manage the passenger boom sparked by deregulation in a way that ignores deregulation's fundamental message -- let the market decide. 

   "I don't believe anybody should be rationed out," says Mr. Kahn. 
"If a corporate jet is willing to pay $10,000 to land at a peak time, let them do it. 
I'd prefer not to have Massport allocate but to price correctly and let the market allocate." 

   Dissenters to Phase Two offer pragmatic as well as philosophical objections. 

   Big airports like Logan rely on public money in the form of federal grants and fuel taxes, and therefore are constrained from such sweeping restrictions on access, argue some critics. 
Airport administrators in the West and Midwest wonder what havoc Logan's unilateral action might wreak on their business traffic to Boston. 
Small commuter and general aviation airlines are livid over the new landing fees and are fighting them on several fronts. 

   Although Massport spokesman Tom Champion insists "we have the ability to do these things on our own," that may not be the case. 
If an administrative law judge rules against Massport later this month, the Department of Transportation is expected to order the new landing fees rescinded, placing Logan's federal funding -- which accounts for nearly a third of its total operating budget -- at risk. 
Meanwhile, a federal district court ruling in support of Massport's prerogative is under appeal. 

   Most offensive to free-market advocates, however, is the criterion by which Massport proposes to limit takeoffs and landings during prime time. 

   "I have been generally supportive of the PACE program, but now they're running up against the inherent conflict of having to choose between different types of users," says Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation in Santa Monica, Calif. 

   Instead of arbitrarily selecting size as the means of establishing preference, Mr. Poole joins Mr. Kahn in advocating reliance on market pricing. 
"CEOs may have an extremely high value on their time and they might be flying a commercial airline, commuter plane or Piper Cub," he notes. 
"They ought to have a right to express their time preference by being willing to pay a premium." 

   PACE Phase Two reminds Fred Smith Jr., president of the Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute, of failed governmental experiments with high-occupancy vehicle express lanes -- or HOVE lanes -- on busy commuter highways. 

   "It's the HOVE lane mentality -- first government creates scarcity and then it misallocates it," says Mr. Smith. 
"Rather than trying to build its way out of infrastructure problems, Logan is experimenting with a rule approach, using an engineering rule rather than a choice rule. 
If they're going to invest that kind of political time and energy they should do it in a way that maximizes choice and efficiency." 

   Massport argues that's just what it is doing, and the whole debate may become moot anyway if the federal government or courts strike down Phase One. 
But there is grim humor in the specter of regulators and business squaring off over how to make Logan livable. 

   A major contributor to Logan's congestion problem is the fact that unlike other major airports, such as Chicago's O'Hare or Atlanta's Hartsfield, Logan has no parallel runways to allow simultaneous arrivals and departures. 
In 1974, as part of an airport expansion plan that would have swelled Logan's takeoff and landing capacity by 90,000 annually, $23 million was spent on initial construction of new runway 14-32. 

   Environmentalists and airport abutters howled, and in 1975 freshman Gov. Michael Dukakis, then famous for his anti-business reflexes, killed the runway plan. 
As recently as last year a Federal Aviation Administration task force urged completion of runway 14-32 as a key to increased airport efficiency, but Mr. Davis insists any plans for runway construction are "dead in the water." 

   Perhaps the Logan regulators have made themselves a bed they cannot sleep in, suggests Mr. Smith: "An ideology of radical egalitarianism that sees people as uniform blocks of mud is what gives you the idea that 200 scouts are better than two CEOs."

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Finds Logan Fees Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Port Authority unreasonably and
illegally imposed a dual set of landing fees to discourage small
planes from using Logan International Airport, a federal appeals
court ruled Thursday.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
wrote that Massport's its landing fee system had been
unscientifically developed and unfairly discriminated against small
planes.
   Massport's policy was based on the premise that commercial jets
carrying 400 passengers should have priority over a six-seat private
plane, but federal law has long held that all aircraft should have
equal access to U.S. runways.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation, which objected to
Massport's fees, ``has broad authority and responsibility to
regulate navigable airspace to assure its efficient use ... and to
protect `the right of freedom of transit through navigable
airspace,''' the court ruled.
   Massport officials said they were disapppointed with the decision
but hope to work with new leadership at the transportation
department in Washington to ease delay and congestion at Logan.
   Massport last year raised the landing fee for small aircraft at
Logan from a flat $25 per touchdown to a minimum of $100. At the
same time, commercial jet fees were cut. A jumbo jet, for example,
saw its $800 fee cut in half.
   The owners of private and commuter planes complained, but traffic
dropped by one-third and on-time performance for commercial jets
surged from last place among the country's 27 largest airports in
May 1988, to second place in December 1988.

   The Transportation Department, concerned about
local officials interfering in the free flow of air travel,
announced an investigation Friday into plans to sharply increase
landing fees for small aircraft at Boston's Logan International
Airport.
   Private pilots and some commuter airlines have complained loudly
that the higher fees will amount to them being driven from Boston's
major airport.
   At the same time, Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley asked the
operators of Logan to hold off on the landing fee increases, which
are to go into effect July 1, until the department's investigation
has been concluded next November.
   Despite the federal urging, officials of the Massachusetts Port
Authority, the state agency that runs the airport, said they plan
to go ahead with the higher landing fees as scheduled.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to delay (the fee increase),''
David Davies, executive director of Massport, said in a telephone
interview.
   A spokesman for Massport, Thomas Champion, said the higher fee
structure remains ``an essential first step in our overall program
to improve service at Logan for all New England travelers. It
should be implemented without delay and we're committed to a July 1
startup date.''
   The Transportation Department in a statement called the Massport
decision to proceed with the higher fees ``disppointing'' but said
it is ``premature to speculate whether the new fee schedule will
actually go into effect.''
   The plan calls for base landing fees to be increased from $25 to
nearly $100 with an additional charge pegged to the weight of the
aircraft. This would sharply increase the fees required from
operators of small, personal planes, business aircraft and
commuters, while the costs to the major airlines in some cases
would decline, critics complain.
   Burnley has been under intense pressure in recent months from
groups representing private pilots and commuter airlines as well as
some members of Congress to intervene in the Massport issue, which
is seen as a maneuver by the airport's operators to drive away all
but the scheduled airlines.
   Officials at crowded airports around the country are known to be
closely watching the Massport case and what actions the federal
government might take.
   Legislation designed to prevent the Logan plan from being
implemented has been introduced in Congress, but its chances for
passage seem slight this year.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' Rep. Sherwood
Boehler, R-N.Y., said recently of the Massport proposal. ``There
are airports all over the country sort of foaming at the mouth,
just waiting to follow suit.''
   The Transportation Department said its investigation
specifically would examine complaints received about the higher
fees at Logan from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the
National Business Aircraft Association and the Regional Airlines
Association.
   These complaints indicate that ``reasonable grounds exist to
investigate whether Massport's action violates'' federal aviation
laws, the department said. Burnley said he would decide whether
further action is necessary after the report is received sometime
before Nov. 15.
   In a letter to Massport officials, Burnley urged that the new
landing fee structure not be implemented until the federal
investigation is completed because of ``the potential impact'' and
because the complaints about the fees ``raise questions involving
national transportation policy.''
   Davis said he was perplexed by the DOT request because a federal
court in Boston had already agreed to consider expeditiously a suit
challenging the higher fees with hopes of a ruling before they are
imposed. The court case is expected to give the issue a full
review, he suggested.

   The man who runs Boston's Logan Airport faced the
same problem plaguing major airports worldwide: how to cut the
delays that were making flying an ever more unpleasant experience.
   His solution: discourage small planes from using the airport by
raising their takeoff and landing fees while cutting the charges
for commercial airliners.
   ``If you think that all planes are created equal, then I'm
wrong,'' says David W. Davis, executive director of the
Massachusetts Port Authority. ``But there's no way you can convince
me that a small plane with two people aboard has the same priority
as a large airplane with 400.''
   Small aircraft that had paid a flat $25 to land at Logan found
themselves facing a bill for $100-plus every time they set down.
Jumbo jets, by contrast, had their $800 landing fee cut in half.
   Davis' plan worked. The number of private and commuter planes
using the airport fell by one-third. Logan, ranked last in on-time
performance among the 27 biggest U.S. airports last May, surged to
second place in the December rankings.
   But the federal government disagreed with the move, saying the
new regulations violated federal aviation laws and were
``inconsistent with national transportation policy.'' As 1988
ended, the port authority suspended its fee revisions until a
federal appeals court hears arguments in the dispute early next
month.
   On one side are the nation's air travelers and airport
operators, struggling as they are with steadily growing demands for
limited runway space. On the other, private aircraft owners,
corporate plane users and commuter airlines, all of which contend
that a six-seat Piper Cub has the same right to use a runway as a
400-seat DC-10.
   Airports operate like bakery counters: Pilots wanting to take
off or land are all given numbers and must wait their turn. And,
like the bakery customer out to buy two dozen doughnuts, three
loaves of bread and a pound of cookies but who must wait for the
person before him to purchase his lone sticky bun, pilots are all
treated alike.
   Davis argues that the result of such an egalitarian policy, for
more and more people, comes down to a single word: wait.
   Wait to board the plane. Wait for clearance to take off. Wait at
the other end for permission to land. Wait with other passengers
whose trips have likewise been bollixed up for luggage, for a cab
and for the traffic on jammed highways to clear.
   But critics accuse the Massport director of trying to
single-handedly dictate transportation policy and transgressing
long-established laws that guarantee aircraft equal access to the
nation's runways.
   John Baker, president of the 265,000-member Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, says eliminating all the small planes wouldn't
cure congestion at Logan. What the airport really needs, he says,
is another runway _ one set aside for private planes.
   Jonathan Howe, president of the National Business Aircraft
Association, says that if the Massport program stands, other
airports might follow with their restrictions, creating ``chaos''
in the skies.
   But even critics give Davis credit for forcing a debate on
capacity at the nation's overburdened airports.
   Consider these facts:
   _Air passenger traffic has doubled since Jimmy Carter
deregulated airlines a decade ago. In 1976, 11.5 million people
flew through Logan; by 1988, terminal traffic more than doubled, to
23.3 million.
   _Requests to take off and land frequently hit 100 an hour during
Logan's peak periods. That's fine in good weather, when the airport
can handle 110 flights each hour, but not so fine on the one day in
five of bad weather. Then, capacity shrinks to 80 takeoffs and
landings an hour.
   _Before Davis restructured runway fees, port authority officials
say, private and commuter planes accounted for 40 percent of
Logan's takeoffs and landings, but just 6 percent of passengers.
   _Port authority officials say rush-hour backups routinely hit 60
minutes in 1987. Sometime next year, they project, the delays may
stretch to 100 minutes unless the number of takeoffs and landings
falls.
   To deal with these issues, Davis rejiggered the way runway-use
fees were assessed, arguing that many airport costs are fixed and
bear no relation to the size of planes using the facility.
   ``If a Cessna needs fire and crash assistance, you're not going
to send one pick-up truck with a fire extinguisher,'' he says. ``If
a Beechcraft needs to land on a snowy day, you're not going to plow
the middle third of the runway and let it go at that.''
   Authorities felt their logic was unassailable and noted besides
that discouraging a single small plane from using Logan could help
speed hundreds of jumbo jet passengers on their way.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation felt differently.
   In November, a federal administrative law judge ruled that
Logan's fee restructuring violated aviation laws and unfairly
saddled small planes with ``a disproportionate amount of airport
costs.''
   The next month, Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi W. Dawson
upheld the ruling by law judge Burton S. Kolko.
   At the same time, New England legislators had gotten Congress to
threaten the port authority with a cutoff of $10 million in aid
unless the old fee structure was reimposed.
   Massport backed off; the $25 minimum was reborn.
   Opponents of the plan make these arguments:
   _The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association says that even
before Davis' revisions, private planes accounted for just 3
percent of Logan's peak-hours operations.
   ``They phony up the numbers by using 24-hour numbers,'' says
Baker. ``There are periods at Logan where you can shoot a cannon
through there and not hit an airplane.''
   Besides, he adds, few pleasure flyers use airports like Logan
these days.
   ``You put yourself in the elephant line and you suffer the same
privations that everybody else does in the airlines because of
irrational airline scheduling,'' Baker says.
   _The National Business Aircraft Association, which represents 83
percent of the Fortune 500 companies, says the issue in Boston is
the right of equal access to airports and airspace.
   Says Howe:
   ``If you've got the chairman of the board of IBM flying into
Boston to sign an agreement to open up a major computer
manufacturing business that's going to employ 5,000 people in a
Boston suburb, is it more important for him to arrive there in time
to sign that agreement than it is to delay a load of passengers
coming back from Bermuda on vacation?''
   Thomas Champion, Davis' assistant, responds to Howe's argument
by maintaining that a majority of airline passengers suffering
lengthy delays ``weren't charter loads of revelers on their way to
Bermuda or Cub Scouts going to Disneyworld. They were business
travelers.''

   A Transportation Department official ruled against the landingfee system by which Massachusetts Port Authority hoped to ease air traffic congestion at Boston's Logan International Airport. 

   Burton Kolko, an administrative law judge, found that the landing fees unjustly discriminate against smaller planes and interfere with interstate commerce. 
Mr. Kolko, in an 88-page decision, urged the department to declare the fees illegal. 
If it does, the port authority would have to change the fees or face the loss of $11.2 million a year in federal funds. 

   The department must rule on the issue by Dec. 17. 

   The Logan case is being watched closely by aviation groups because it could have implications far beyond Boston. 
The central issues include whether a local airport has the authority to take steps to ease airport congestion or whether only the federal government can act. 
The case also could affect airports' right to make rules governing other problems, such as noise. 

   The new landing-fees schedule, which went into effect July 1, sharply boosts fees for smaller planes while lowering them for commercial airliners. 
The port authority's goal is to ease congestion at the busy airport by encouraging commuter and private planes to use other airports or bigger planes. 

   The Transportation Department's decision may not be the last word on the case, however. 
A federal appeals court in Boston also is expected to rule early next year on a lawsuit against the fees by aviation groups. 

   The landing-fee schedule has become a cause celebre among small-plane operators, and yesterday they hailed Mr. Kolko's decision. 
"We're greatly encouraged," said John Fredericksen, executive vice president of the Regional Airline Association, which represents commuter airlines. 

   But a top port authority official said the decision was only "one step in the process." 
In addition, Thomas Champion, assistant to David Davis, the port authority's executive director, insisted that the new landing-fee structure is working; about 86% of Logan's flights were roughly on-time in September, up from 70% in September 1987, he said. 
At the same time, he added, some commuter airlines are using bigger planes, allowing them to carry more passengers with fewer flights. 

   "That tells us we are moving in the right direction," Mr. Champion said.

   A federal administrative judge ruled Thursday
that stiff landing fees aimed at keeping smaller aircraft out of
Boston's Logan Airport violate federal aviation law because they are
discriminatory and unfair.
   A final decision on how to deal with the fee structure imposed
last summer by the Massachusetts Port Authority rests with the
Transportation Department, to whom administrative law judge Burton
S. Kolko made his recommendations.
   The case has been seen within the aviation industry as a test
over how much power the federal government intends to allow local
officials and airport operators in dealing with air traffic
congestion.
   A DOT spokesman said the department will decide by Dec. 17
whether to uphold Kolko's decision or come down with an alternative
finding on the Boston airport fees, which have raised a storm of
protests among private and business pilots and in the commuter
airline industry.
   Kolko in his decision said the Logan fees ``are lacking in
economic justification ... not fair and reasonable (and) are
unjustly discriminatory'' toward private aircraft and smaller
commuter planes.
   The judge said that Massport officials acted in violation of
federal aviation laws and he concluded that the Transportation
Department has legal grounds on which to take pre-emptive action to
have the fees revoked.
   Massport officials said that since the fee structure has been in
place, Logan has handled more passengers with fewer delays.
   ``It is unsettling then, that all the benefits ... could be
dismantled if DOT accepts the recommendations issued today,'' the
company said.
   The Transportation Department announced last summer that it
planned to closely examine the so-called ``Pace Program'' enacted at
Logan to curtail the volume of air traffic in and out of the busy
Boston airport.
   After loud protests from private pilots and some commuter
airlines, Congress included in its DOT appropriations legislation
earlier this year a provision ordering the department to stop
airport construction money for Logan if it concludes the fees
violate aviation law and are not rescinded.
   Massport approved the higher landing fees for small aircraft last
March, saying Logan's capacity ``is a finite resource, which must be
managed wisely and efficiently in order to keep people moving with a
minimum of delay.''
   The airport's operators said they wanted to use Logan's limited
capacity for airliner traffic and not private aircraft, maintaining
that a large jetliner with up to 400 people aboard ``deserves a
higher priority than a Cessna with two people on board.''
   The new fee structure went into effect in July after a U.S.
district judge ruled that the fees were not discriminatory.
   The higher fees have affected both private pilots and commuter
airlines. The government said some commuter services were
discontinued to Logan after the new fees went into effect, but that
most commuters just passed the higher costs on to air travelers.
   While the conclusion Thursday by Kolko is little more than a
recommendation to senior department officials on whether to take
administrative action, it was hailed by private pilot groups and
other critics of the Logan fees.
   John Baker, president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association, called the law judge's decision ``well reasoned'' and
said, ``It makes it clear once and for all this country has a
national aviation system that must be regulated by appropriate
federal authority.''
   Jonathan Howe, head of the National Business Aircraft
Association, said his group now ``looks forward to .. the final
determination'' on the Massport fees by Deputy Secretary Mimi Dawson
next month.
   ``The entire aviation community was gratified'' by Kolko's
findings, said Edward W. Stimpson, president of the General Aviation
Manufacturers Association, the trade group that represents builders
of small aircraft.

   A federal appeals court here confirmed that Boston's Logan International Airport can't reduce congestion by raising landing fees for smaller planes. 

   The Transportation Department last year found that the scheme violates federal law. 
The Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns Logan Airport, had appealed. 

   The plan, adopted last year, raised landing fees for commuter flights and private planes and lowered them for airliners. 
The fee structure was geared to encourage commuter airlines to use larger aircraft and private pilots to use other airports. 

   According to the Massachusetts Port Authority, the scheme worked. 
While the new fee structure was in place, Logan Airport climbed to rank No. 2 in the nation in terms of on-time arrivals. 
After the program was rescinded in January, following the Department of Transportation ruling, the airport's ranking in that category dropped to No. 22, the authority said. 

   The appeals court decision "was a setback, but it was not a roadblock" to reducing airport congestion, said David W. Davis, executive director of the Massachusetts Port Authority. 
He said the authority hopes to work with "the new leadership at the Department of Transportation" to deal with the problems. 

   The authority said a decision hasn't been made on whether it will appeal the latest ruling.

   Logan International Airport's operators haven't
ended their fight after grudgingly complying with a federal order to
halt hefty fees that were designed to dissuade small craft from
landing at the crowded airfield.
   The new landing fee system had been watched closely by the
aviation industry nationwide as a possible precedent for dealing
with congestion at major airports. Federal officials rank Logan
among the country's 10 most congested airports.
   Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation ruled the fee
structure was unreasonable, discriminatory and in violation of
federal law.
   Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi Weyforth Dawson signed an
order Thursday that gave the Massachusetts Port Authority seven days
to rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $10.2 million
in federal aviation improvement grants for this fiscal year.
   In response, Port Authority officials voted Tuesday to
temporarily suspend the increased landing fees beginning today, but
to file a request with the U.S. Court of Appeals here seeking a
review of the matter.
   ``We are simply recognizing that an aircraft carrying hundreds
and hundreds of people should not have to wait in line while a small
craft carrying maybe one or two people lands,'' said Theresa
McAlpine, a spokeswoman for the state agency.
   Bob Marx, a spokesman for the federal agency, said it would have
no comment on the Port Authority vote.
   Small aircraft lobbyists said they would continue their vigorous
opposition to the plan, which they said cost them an average of 500
percent more in fees.
   ``At this point the whole case has been ... groundbreaking. We
feel that the Department of Transportation's decision is final and
binding and certainly very clear,'' said Patricia Weil, a spokesman
for the national Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
   The Program for Airport Capacity Efficiency, which went into
effect July 1, was intended to reduce congestion and delays by
charging fees so high they would discourage users of small craft
from flying in and out of Logan.
   Under the new fee structure, all planes were assessed an $88 flat
fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. The old system charged $1.31 per
1,000 pounds or $25, whichever was greater.
   The new fee for a Boeing 747, for example, dropped to $450 from
$680, while a Cessna 402 seating 10 passengers was charged $106
versus $25, McAlpine said.
   Organizations representing small aircraft pilots reacted by
filing complaints in court and with the federal Department of
Transportation.

   WASHINGTON -- Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
announced plans to allow airports to charge airlines higher
landing fees during peak travel hours and lower fees during
slack periods.
   The policy would reduce congestion and delays by creating
"incentives to travel at off-peak times," he said. Mr.
Skinner made his remarks at an airline-industry conference.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Murphy, the deputy assistant transportation
secretary for policy and international affairs, said the
department will seek public comment soon on a proposed
peak-hour pricing policy. In an interview, Mr. Murphy said
it's hoped that such pricing would create sufficient economic
incentives to prompt airlines and private pilots to switch
some flights to slower periods. "All we have to do is shift a
couple of flights per hour, and that will have a big impact
on airlines' on-time performance," he said.
   Peak-hour pricing would probably mean higher airline fares
during rush hours as the airlines pass along their costs to
consumers. But many analysts contend that would be only fair.
"It's like advertising on prime-time television," said Kevin
Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "You have
to pay more than in the middle of the afternoon."
   But Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport
Association, which represents the airline industry, noted
that the airlines already are practicing peak-hour pricing by
making fewer discount fares available during rush-hour
flights.
   In addition, he said that although the concept may be
good, it would be difficult for airports to put peak-hour
pricing into effect. For example, he argued, landing fees
would have to be increased drastically -- 20 or 30 times --
in order to compel carriers to switch their flights from peak
periods. Otherwise, he said, airlines wouldn't change their
schedules out of fear they would lose passengers to
competitors. And he said that such high fees would shut out
commuter lines.
   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which
represents 300,000 private pilots, also is worried that its
members would be hurt by peak-hour pricing. "We're concerned
that it would keep out aircraft that should be able to use a
runway just the same as a commercial airliner," said Phil
Boyer, president of the group. Increases in landing fees are
more burdensome for private pilots because they have to
absorb the entire cost themselves.
   Mr. Boyer said peak-hour pricing was like "putting a
Band-Aid" on the nation's long-term airport capacity problem.
Jonathan Howe, president of the National Business Aircraft
Association, which represents corporate jet owners, said he
would support a "properly constructed system" as long as it
isn't "used as a device to limit access" to airports by
smaller planes.
   Currently, landing fees at airports are weight-based;
those for small planes generally range from $2 to $25, while
jetliners pay hundreds of dollars for each flight. There
isn't a flat prohibition against tying the landing fees to
time of day. Airports, however, have been leery to impose
such a system because of a flap that occurred in the late
1980s involving Boston's Logan International Airport.
   To cut congestion, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which
runs the airport, sharply increased landing fees for smaller
planes while slashing them for airliners. But the fees
weren't tied to peak hours; they were in effect for the
entire day.
   A number of groups, including AOPA and NBAA, sued, and in
late 1988 successfully overturned the Logan fees. The
Transportation Department also opposed the Massachusetts Port
rules, arguing they discriminated against small-plane
operators.

   To sports fans here, it's a crime the way officials sometimes let the Detroit Pistons get away with elbowing and shoving the hometown Celtics. 
But there's at least one Piston violation that Boston isn't about to ignore: Flying a noisy jet over Beantown late at night. 

   Following a double-overtime loss to the Celtics in a playoff game here Friday evening, the Pistons piled into their BAC-111 team airplane and thundered off for Detroit at 12:30 a.m. -- flouting a rule at Boston's Logan International Airport banning flights of loud aircraft between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. 

   "The BAC-111 is one of the noisiest planes in the system," says Phil Orlandella, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs the airport. 
"They clearly violated our noise-abatement rules." 

   He adds that this was no technical violation; it was, he says, only the last in a flurry of airport fouls by the Pistons in the team's latest trip to Boston. 
For instance, he says, the plane was initially parked where it wasn't supposed to be, and then taxied against airport rules to another spot. 
That riled airport officials, "but we didn't cite them," says Mr. Orlandella. 

   The noisy takeoff, however, went too far. 
"The Pistons like to slam-dunk you on these things," says Patrick Moscaritolo, Logan's acting aviation director. 
Airport officials are requesting an explanation from the Pistons' management and may file criminal charges against it. 

   A spokesman for the Pistons declines to comment on the matter. 

   The spat, meanwhile, has added fuel to another fire. 
U.S. Rep. Bob Carr, a Michigan Democrat whose district includes Pontiac, site of the Pistons' arena, has been threatening to request a cutoff of federal funds to the Boston Port Authority unless it delays a plan to sharply raise landing fees at Logan for smaller aircraft. 

   In an interview with the Associated Press, Rep. Carr charged that the airport's complaints about the Pistons' plane is either "part of your basic Boston Garden harassment" or "because we're coming down pretty hard" on the Port Authority regarding landing fees. 

   Boston is hanging tough, though. 
Says Logan's Mr. Orlandella: "Who the hell is he (Rep. 
Carr) to tell us how to run our airport?" 
Mr. Moscaritolo adds that if necessary, the Port Authority is ready to square off in a Boston court against the Pistons. 
"The judge lives right under Logan's flight path," he adds.

   Logan International Airport authorities announced steps intended to reduce aircraft congestion during peak hours and to divert smaller aircraft to other regional airports. 

   Some of the steps would require federal approval, the authorities said. 
But David Davis, executive director of Massachusetts Port Authority, which oversees the airport, indicated he might try to implement the measures even if federal approvals aren't forthcoming. 

   Among the steps under consideration are increasing minimum landing fees and charging terminal fees for small aircraft, imposing surcharges during peak hours, and limiting commuter airline operations. 

   A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said the agency's lawyers hadn't yet seen the Logan proposals and couldn't comment. 

   Air traffic at Logan has increased substantially in recent years, making it one of the country's most congested airports.

<HEAD>Passengers Brawl Aboard Continental Jet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines said Sunday an altercation
aboard one of its jets occurred after the plane touched down and
did not cause an aborted landing at Logan International Airport.
   The airline's explanation differed from an account given by the
Massachusetts State Police after interviewing the crew of Flight
358.
   Six people, including a counsel to the New Jersey Senate, his
wife and four Massachusetts residents, were arrested at Logan after
the fight.
   Steven Sacks-Wilner, 39, of Montgomery Township, N.J., and his
wife, Joanne, 37, were arrested when the flight from Trenton, N.J.,
landed at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, according to state police Cpl. Joseph
Howley.
   ``They had a little brawl,'' he said. ``It started out as a
husband and wife that were sort of running around the plane and
making demands on the crew and being a general nuisance and
hollering.''
   The fight between the couple occurred in the air, and expanded
to involve four other passengers, police said. The on-board
confusion led the pilot of the 146-passenger MD-80 aircraft to give
up on his first landing try, said Sgt. Stephen Kelley.
   ``They were fighting in the aisles just prior to touch down,''
Kelley said. ``The pilot was afraid that when the pilot reversed
throttle on his englines _ which you do not feel when you're in
your seat _ the whole troop that was fighting in the aisles would
have wound up in the cockpit.''
   Kelley said state police based their explanation on interviews
with the flight crew. He said the fight lasted 15 to 20 minutes.
   According to the airline, however, the fight began and ended
after the jet landed at Logan International Airport.
   The jet had had to bypass its first landing because a Northwest
Airlines jet was slow in taxiing out of the way, said Ned Walker, a
Continental spokesman.
   ``I have spoken with the captain who said there was a Northwest
plane on the runway that was slow to clear and resulted in his
decision to do what they call a go-around,'' Walker said.
   Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Boston, said Sunday that the Logan control tower
heard nothing of an on-board altercation before the landing.
   ``The airplane, making a normal approach, was given a routine
go-around because the airplane landing in front of him was slow in
clearing the runway,'' Ciccarelli said.
   The FAA has opened an investigation into the incident.
   Sacks-Wilner, the chief counsel for the Republican minority in
the New Jersey Senate, faces charges of interference with a flight
crew, disorderly conduct and three counts of assault on a police
officer, Howley said. Sacks-Wilner allegedly fought back at police
when they boarded the plane and arrested him.
   All those arrested were released from the state police lockup
pending arraignment Monday in East Boston District Court.
   Mrs. Sacks-Wilner and three Medford residents, Frank J.
Federico, 50, his wife Camella, 48, their son John, 22, all face
charges of interfering with a flight crew, as does John's
19-year-old girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte of Revere, Howley said.
   The Massachusetts passengers ``tried to assist the crew and
wound up getting in the crew's way,'' the state police corporal
said.

<HEAD>$10.9 Billion Transportation Appropriations Bill Sent to House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the
Coast Guard would both receive large increases in their budgets
under the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations bill approved
by a House committee.
   The bill also would continue federal support for Amtrak, the
passenger rail line, against the Reagan administration's wishes.
   The bill was sent to the full House on Thursday by a voice vote
of the Appropriations Committee. It would provide $10.9 billion for
the government's transportation programs in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The legislation also would give the government authority to
spend an additional $16.9 billion from special accounts set aside
for various aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   It gives the Coast Guard a budget of nearly $3.1 billion, and
directs that at least $492 million of that amount be used for drug
interdiction programs. FAA spending would grow to nearly $6.7
billion, with enough money to increase the number of air traffic
controllers from 16,020 to 16,800 by Sept. 30, 1989.
   Both amounts are increases of about 16 percent over spending
levels this year.
   The appropriations bill would provide $3.3 billion for mass
transit, $1.8 billion more than proposed by the Reagan
administration, and $594 million for Amtrak. The administration had
sought to end all federal assistance to the passenger railroad,
which expects to carry 34 million passengers next year.
   Another provision of the bill would threaten the coffers of
Boston's Logan International Airport if it pursues plans to reduce
congestion by raising landing fees for small planes.
   Logan officials plan to increase charges for small aircraft on
July 1 in an effort to reduce the number of private planes landing
there and thus ease delays for commercial airliners.
   Groups representing private aircraft owners have filed federal
suits aimed at blocking the plan, claiming the fees discriminate
against small plane owners.
   In addition, the Transportation Department has opened an
investigation of the program and asked Logan officials to delay
implementing the new fees until the inquiry is complete, probably
in November. Airport officials have refused.
   An amendment to the appropriations bill, introduced by Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and adopted by a 19-15 vote, would withhold
federal assistance to Logan unless the courts and the
Transportation Department decide that the new fee structure is
legal.
   Logan spokesman Tom Champion said the measure would affect $11.2
million in federal money, to be used mostly for noise reduction and
runway improvement. The loss of the aid would have little effect on
the airport's operations, he said.

<HEAD>Jury Blames Government, Port Authority for World Airways Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury's finding that the federal government and
Massachusetts Port Authority were to blame for the 1982 crash of a
World Airways jet here came as surprise, the airline's attorney says.
   The U.S. District Court jury Tuesday exonerated World Airways in
the crash, in which a DC-10 carrying 105 passengers and 12 crew
members slid off an icy runway at Logan International Airport. Two
passengers were presumed killed and 39 were injured.
   World Airways, the federal government and Massport, which
operates Logan, have blamed each other for the accident.
   David W. Davis, executive director of Massport which operates
Logan, could not immediately say whether the agency would appeal
Tuesday's verdict.
   ``I felt very strongly and still feel that the principal cause of
the accident was pilot error but for whatever reason the jury has
felt differently and we're going to have to go on from there,''
Davis said.
   James Meehan, chief counsel for World Airways, said the decision
was ``a wonderful and hard-fought victory.''
   ``It took seven years to put the pieces of what happened that
night together,'' Meehan said, ``and finally to lay the
responsibility where it should rest for World Airways and that's
with Massport and the federal government and they fought it all the
way.''
   A new trial to determine who will pay what percentage of damages
was scheduled to begin Feb. 27 in U.S. District Court here.
   Meehan said that although the jury assigned blame to both the
Federal Aviation Administration and Massport, World Airways would
seek to recover damages only from the Port Authority.
   Under federal law, interest on the cost of compensation, the lost
aircraft and the rescue of passengers and crew from the wrecked
aircraft cannot be assessed on the U.S. government.
   ``But we can recover the full amount from Massport and that's
what we intend to do,'' Meehan said.
   Meehan said the ruling came as a pleasant surprise following U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Keeton's 1986 ruling, which found World
Airways 50 percent responsible for the accident, Massport 30 percent
responsible and the federal government 20 percent responsible.
   At the time, Keeton said Massport had failed to close the runway
despite hazardous conditions and that neither it nor the FAA had
informed World Airways that conditions had deteriorated.
   Massport and the federal government have maintained, however,
that the crash was caused by pilot error.
   Keeton made his ruling after a previous jury failed to reach a
verdict and a mistrial was declared.
   Lawyers for both sides said it was not immediately clear how the
divergent decisions would affect one another, but Meehan said
Keeton's ruling was binding solely on the U.S. government.

<HEAD>World Airways to Receive $62.9 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Port Authority has been ordered
to pay $62.9 million to World Airways for its liability in a 1982
plane crash at Logan International Airport.
   Massport officials said they would appeal Friday's ruling by
U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Keeton, who also ruled the
airline could recover an additional $1.6 million from the federal
government.
   In earlier trials, federal juries ruled that the authority and
the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for the January
1982 crash, which killed two people.
   The DC-10, carrying 212 passengers, attempted to land on an icy
runway at Logan, but slid off the runway and into Boston Harbor.
The nose of the plane was severed from the fuselage and passengers
and crew had to swim in the frigid waters to safety.
   While the juries determined Massport and the federal government
were to blame for not taking adequate safety measures in icy
conditions, the amount of the settlement remained to be determined
and questions of interest remained in dispute until Friday.
   The total set by Keeton takes into account $33 million for the
value of the aircraft, interest over the seven years since the
accident, and several passenger claims, The Boston Globe reported.
   Attorneys in the case told the newspaper that Massport may be
able to recover $11 million of the total settlement from the
federal government because the FAA was also found at fault.
   Other issues in the case still remain unresolved, however.
Keeton must rule on motion for a new trial relating to emotional
distress claimed by crew members.
   The pilot, Peter Langley, and his co-pilot were awarded $2
million in damages in April, but Keeton ruled that that amount was
excessive and planned to reduce it by 80 percent, the newspaper
said.

<HEAD>House Debates $10.8 Billion Transportation Spending Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: House debate resumes at 10 a.m. EDT; time for final passage
uncertain. A version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is moving toward final passage of a
bill providing $10.8 billion in new spending for the government's
transportation programs for fiscal 1989, despite a Reagan
administration veto threat.
   Approval of the legislation was expected today, even though
administration officials say rejection of the measure by President
Reagan is possible because it is too expensive.
   The legislation would provide $2 billion above the amount Reagan
requested for transportation programs for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1, and $182 million over the amount provided for this
year. It contains large increases for the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Coast Guard.
   The bill would also allow the government to spend up to an
additional $15.4 billion out of revenues collected each year
specifically for aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   As usual, the bill also contains a number of highway projects
and other items aimed at particular districts.
   Altogether, the measure would allow $3.1 billion in spending for
the Coast Guard, a 16 percent increase over 1988 levels. At least
$492 million would have to be spent on drug interdiction efforts.
   The Federal Aviation Administration would be entitled to spend
more than $6.6 billion, 15 percent more than this year. Most of the
money would be for the salaries of air traffic controllers and
other workers, new equipment such as radar, and grants to airports
for construction.
   Amtrak, the federally subsidized passenger railroad, would
receive $590 million and mass transit programs would get $3.3
billion.
   It was for those programs that lawmakers differed most radically
from Reagan's proposed budget. The president wanted to terminate
all federal aid to Amtrak, which expects to carry 34 million
passengers next year, and provide mass transit programs with barely
half the amount the House approved.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $10.6 billion
version of the bill last Friday. When the full Senate passes that
legislation, the two chambers will have to agree to a compromise
bill before it is sent to Reagan for his signature.
   When debate on the House bill began Tuesday, lawmakers removed
provisions that might have blocked federal aid to Boston's Logan
International Airport.
   Officials at Logan plan to increase landing fees July 1 for
small aircraft, which they say would reduce delays for airline
passengers by encouraging private and commuter planes to use nearby
airfields. The program is supported by Boston-area legislators.
   Opponents inserted a provision that would have withheld federal
assistance to Logan until the Department of Transportation
completes an investigation of Logan's plan, and until the courts
rule on challenges filed by small aircraft industry groups.
   The provision was removed on procedural grounds, however, after
Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., complained that by House rules,
it should not have been included in a spending bill. Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House at the time,
upheld Kennedy's objection. There was no vote.
   Similar provisions blocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate
version of the transportation bill.
   The House bill would also attempt to block a private developer's
plans to build a shopping mall in Manassas, Va., on part of what
was the scene of the Second Battle of Bull Run, a Confederate
victory during the Civil War. The provision, introduced by Civil
War buff Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., would forbid the government to
approve the construction of exits from highways that serve the area.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Gridlock in the vast open skyways? Well, it's not
that dire yet, but aviation officials are worried that today's
airports won't be able to handle the amount of traffic expected in
the next decade or so. Further, little is being done about it. Here
is a report from an AP reporter who covers the aviation beat in
Washington.

<TEXT>
   On the day before Christmas, some 2 million
people rushed to airports across America, expecting turmoil or
delays. They often found both.
   That kind of airport crush, now usually seen only on Thanksgiving
and Christmas, is likely to become commonplace by the year 2000 when
the airlines expect to carry nearly 800 million passengers a year,
an average of more than 2 million every day.
   Hello, gridlock.
   Yes, aviation officials are beginning to worry about a logjam in
the air.
   Once the domain of businessmen and the well-heeled, the airlines
have become a mass transit system. A record 455 million passengers
boarded commercial aircraft in 1988, nearly 1.2 million people a
day, compared to 243 million in l977.
   Three of every 10 adults took an airline flight last year, and
nearly three of every four adults had flown at some point in their
lives.
   Yet, no major new airports have been built since 1974, when the
Dallas-Fort Worth airport was constructed on 18,000-acres of Texas
prairie. And while local officials have received agreement on a
massive, futuristic $3 billion airport at Denver, the airlines there
have balked because of the cost.
   Add to that an air traffic control system still struggling to
recover from a 1981 strike, plus federal budget constraints.
   The holiday passenger crunch ``gives us all a glimpse into the
future of air traffic,'' bemoans Herbert Kelleher, chairman of
Southwest Airlines. He says the air transport system of today
``lacks the capacity to handle that volume of traffic on a daily
basis.'' He also says there are scant signs that anything is being
done about it.
   ``I think the single biggest concern in aviation is the capacity
issue,'' agrees John Lauber, a member of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   The traffic demands also raise safety worries, he says,
especially since it is unlikely that dozens of new runways and
airports will be constructed and broad modernization of the air
traffic control system is years away.
   ``There are real questions as to how we are going to accommodate
this growth,'' Lauber warns.
   He acknowledges that there are ways to solve the congestion
problem short of pouring new concrete. But, he says, ``the danger is
that these things will be done before all of the ramifications are
thought through from a safety standpoint. The pressure is there.''
   Among the short-term solutions being considered by the Federal
Aviation Administration are adopting new technology to allow more
planes to land in a shorter time span and increasing use of
computers to predict traffic flow.
   Indeed, the overcrowding is being felt both in the air and on the
ground.
   Seventeen airports used by 40 percent of the flying public were
classified in 1988 as ``seriously congested'' because they handled
160 percent of the traffic for which they were designed. By the year
2000 that number could go as high as 58 airports used by nearly
three out of every four travelers, according to the FAA.
   Officials at Boston's Logan International Airport say as far as
they're concerned aviation gridlock already has arrived.
   Last summer, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan,
imposed a new fee structure that makes it too expensive for owners
of small planes and even some commuter airlines to land. The local
officials argue that in an era of scarce resources priority must be
given to large jetliners carrying hundreds of people.
   The federal Transportation Department has called the action an
interference with national commerce and threatens to withhold
federal airport funds if the fees are not reversed. The Logan
officials, meanwhile, are standing firm and intend to fight the DOT
ruling in court.
   The FAA is still trying to recover from the 1981 strike by air
traffic controllers in which 11,400 were fired and had to be
replaced by inexperienced recruits. While senior managers have drawn
up new flight patterns and adopted a system of central ``flow
control'' to better manage airspace with fewer controllers, problems
persist.
   Only last fall, controllers at Chicago's busy O'Hare
International Airport began making errors so frequently that the
federal government ordered a cut in flights. As a result, the number
of delays jumped.
   Furthermore, the agency's seven-year focus on damage control and
government-wide budget constraints have delayed for several years
the long-range modernization of its air traffic control system.
   The overhauled system is now scheduled for completion in the late
1990s at a cost of $16 billion to $24 billion.
   But many airline executives complain that the capacity crunch is
already here.
   ``We tend to be making a conscious effort to do everything
possible to restrain the transportation system that lies at the core
of travel and tourism,'' complains Robert Crandall, chairman of
American Airlines.
   Problems with air traffic control and restrictions of various
kinds already stifle competition, he argues.
   ``Today, American can't compete with Eastern, Pan Am or Donald
Trump (who recently bought the Eastern shuttle) between Washington
and New York. We can't add flights to and from Chicago, nor can we
operate the ones we already have there with the slightest assurance
that they will either arrive or leave on time.
   ``Even in Nashville our flights often sit on the ground waiting
for a slot in the sky. The reality is we are making air travel
harder and harder rather than making it easier and easier.''
   The airlines for more than a year have warned of impending chaos.
But a $15 million grass-roots campaign to persuade business and
political leaders to push for new airport capacity has so far
produced little.
   ``I don't see a hell of a lot of difference between our aviation
problems a year ago and our aviation problems today except today
they are worse,'' Crandall said at a recent industry conference.
   The industry is especially critical of the government's handling
of the billions of dollars that are collected each year through an 8
percent ticket tax. The money goes into a special trust fund, but in
recent years much more went in than has come out.

<HEAD>Detroit Jet Crash Focuses Attention on Close Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent collision of two jets on the
taxiway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport was a rarity, but there are
dozens of close calls at airports around the nation each year,
safety officials say.
   The National Transportation Safety Board calls them
``incursions'' - incidents in which pilots report that another
airplane came dangerously close to theirs on the ground.
   They have occurred as often as once every 12,754 takeoffs or
landings, which is the ratio for such incidents during a 20-month
period at Logan International Airport in Boston, federal records
show.
   Statistics published Sunday in The Detroit News showed that none
of the incursions at other airports led to collisions, but the
incidents underscore a growing perception that they are becoming a
major industry problem.
   Detroit had 24 close calls reported among 643,000 operations
during the 20-month period that ended Aug. 31. The newspaper
reported the ratio of incursions at 19 major U.S. airports, but not
the actual number of occurrences.
   ``We've been concerned for some time about runway incursions,
and this Detroit accident has helped bring more attention to it,''
said John Lauber, an investigator for the federal safety board.
   ``In no way is it just a Detroit problem. It is a national
problem,'' he said.
   Eight people died Dec. 3 when two Northwest Airlines planes
collided in fog at Detroit Metro. One plane taxied onto the runway
where the other was rushing toward takeoff.
   The statistics were provided to the federal government by pilots
who file reports with the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a
program monitored by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``The hazard potential, the potential of a high-speed collision
is great,'' said David Haase, spokesman for the Airline Pilots
Association.
   ``We feel there are several areas that need to be addressed to
reduce the risk, everything from high-tech surface detection radar
to changing phraseology used by airport personnel,'' he said.
   Following are the 19 airports listed and the number of landings
or takeoffs for every reported incursion.
   Logan International Airport, 12,754; Cleveland Hopkins
International, 16,960; Newark, 18,114; Washington National, 19,035;

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves $10.6 Billion Transportation Measure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a
bill Friday providing $10.6 billion for the government's
transportation programs, despite a veto threat from the Reagan
administration.
   The measure for fiscal 1989, sent to the full Senate on a voice
vote, would also allow spending of up to an additional $14.4
billion from the revenues the government collects each year for
aviation, highway and mass transit programs. The fiscal year begins
Oct. 1.
   Under the legislation, the government would spend $6.6 billion
for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $800
million over this year. Spending for the Coast Guard would grow
$350 million to $3 billion, of which $492 million would be set
aside for drug interdiction work.
   In a continuation of a perennial dispute between the
administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress, the
committee ignored a White House request to slash spending for mass
transit and eliminate federal aid to Amtrak, the passenger railroad.
   Instead, the committee would provide $581 million for Amtrak and
$3.2 billion for mass transit.
   James C. Miller III, director of the president's Office of
Management and Budget, sent letters Thursday to committee members,
saying he would urge President Reagan to veto the legislation.
   Miller complained that the measure would allow $2.3 billion in
spending more than the president wants. He also objected to the
mass transit and Amtrak spending, and the inclusion of about $25
million for local highway projects lawmakers had tucked into the
bill.
   The legislators accepted an amendment on voice vote by Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., aimed at blocking Logan International
Airport in Boston from imposing higher landing fees on small
aircraft.
   In an effort to reduce congestion for airline passengers by
encouraging private planes to use suburban airfields, Logan
officials have scheduled the higher fees to take effect July 1.
   Rudman's provision would halt federal aid to the airport unless
officials agreed to hold off the increases until the Department of
Transportation completes an inquiry on the pricing structure, and
until lawsuits seeking to block the higher costs are settled.
   The House is scheduled to vote next week on a $10.9 billion
version of the spending bill.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Damages To World Airways Pilot, Co-pilot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of a World Airways jet that slid off an
icy runway into Boston Harbor in 1982 said a jury award of more
than $1 million justified his seven years of ``trauma and
heartache.''
   Pilot Peter Langley and co-pilot Donald Hertzfeldt had suffered
``emotional distress, impairment of earning capacity, lost wages
and minor physical injuries'' from the January 1982 crash, said
their attorney, Walter Walker.
   A federal jury Wednesday awarded Langley $1,021,840 and
Hertzfeldt $444,700.
   Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Logan International
Airport, does not believe the evidence supports the verdict and
plans to ask U.S. District Judge Robert A. Keeton to set the award
aside next week, said agency spokeswoman Teresa McAlpine. By law,
the pilot and co-pilot cannot seek damages against the federal
government.
   A separate federal jury earlier this year determined that the
crash was caused by icy runway conditions at Logan and that the
Federal Aviation Association and the port authority had failed to
apprise Langley of the situation. Yet another federal jury awarded
the airline more than $30 million for the loss of the jet.
   Langley, 64, said the decision was ``justification for one's
position over the last seven years and the trauma and all the
heartache that's been going on. In retrospect, I'd rather that it
hadn't happened. Now that it has, I think it is a fair judgment.''
   ``I think the last 30 seconds on the runway are something that
I'm going to live with the rest of my life,'' he said. ``For a
pilot to feel he's not fully in control of his airplane is a most
frightening experience.''
   Langley said he lost confidence and interest in flying after the
crash and gave up his plans to become a flight engineer after he
reached the mandatory retirement age of 60.
   Hertzfeldt is working as a Pan Am shuttle co-pilot, which Walker
said was the only job he could get with a crash on his record.
   Langley said he mentioned the tarmac seemed slippery when the
jet touched down. ``Then a few seconds later I said `No braking' to
the crew,''' Langley said.
   As the end of the runway approached he saw the landing lights
and pilings of a light tower that jutted out into Boston Harbor.
Langley said he was ``literally standing on the brakes, with the
engines in full reverse thrust.''
   When the DC-10 stopped, the front end was in Boston Harbor and
the nose, which had broken off, was partially submerged. The crew
had to swim to safety, and two people sitting in the front seats
were never found and presumably drowned.

   Senate and House negotiators must square the
differences between the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations
bills that both chambers have now passed, but their work is already
shadowed by a threatened veto over appropriations for mass transit
and Amtrak.
   The Senate passed its version of the legislation Tuesday, a
$10.6 billion measure that ignores President Reagan's efforts to
rein in federal spending for local mass transit systems and for
Amtrak, the passenger railroad. The vote was 91-6.
   Reagan administration officials, complaining that the bill would
spend $2.3 billion more than the president believes is justified,
say they will urge him to veto the measure.
   The next step is for House and Senate bargainers to reach a
compromise on the measure, which covers the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. The House passed a $10.8 billion version of the bill on
June 29.
   The Senate bill would allow expenditures of an additional $14.3
billion from taxes that are collected on fuels and other items and
are set aside for aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   Mass transit programs would receive nearly $3.2 billion under
the legislation, double what Reagan wants. The legislation also
would provide $581 million to Amtrak, the federally subsidized
passenger railroad.
   The bill would bring spending for the Coast Guard to $3 billion,
provide $6.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, and
set aside $11.6 billion for highway programs.
   As usual, the legislation contains pet projects for the home
states of members of the Appropriations Committee. Among them are
$35 million for work on Route 1 in New Jersey, home state of
Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg; $16 million for a road project
in Buckhannon and Upshur counties in West Virginia, home of Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd; and $4 million for a bridge in Nashua,
N.H., home of Republican Sen. Warren Rudman.
   The bill would make it harder for a developer to build a
shopping mall and other buildings on a parcel of land in Manassas,
Va., that was part of the battlefield of the Second Battle of Bull
Run, an 1862 Confederate victory. It would forbid the federal
government to approve the construction of highway interchanges in
the area.
   The legislation also would prohibit Boston's Logan airport from
receiving federal assistance unless its system of higher landing
fees for small planes receives a green light from the Department of
Transportation. The case is considered a harbinger for how other
major, congested airports around the nation will handle private
aviation in future years.
   Logan officials raised landing fees for private and commuter
aircraft on July 1, trying to encourage the smaller planes to use
suburban airfields and ease congestion for airline passengers.
   The amendment would require the Transportation Department to
decide by Dec. 5 whether the new charges discriminate against small
aircraft users. If the agency decides against the new fees, federal
aid to Logan will be withheld unless airport officials change their
plan.
   An amendment was included to suspend for one year the penalties
leveled against states whose motorists consistently ignore the 55
mph speed limit.
   If authorities find that more than half the drivers monitored
are driving above 55 mph, a state can lose up to 10 percent of its
federal highway aid. That requirement, however, was not extended to
states that raised their maximum driving speeds to 65 mph under a
federal law passed last year, an omission that has sparked
complaints of unfairness by lawmakers from 55 mph states.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sens. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was approved on a voice vote. New York
is one of three states _ the others are California and North Dakota
_ whose drivers have been found to have been driving too fast, and
which risk losing some of their federal road assistance.
   Moynihan said the one-year suspension would give Congress a
chance to make the law more consistent.

   The sniper who fired an assault rifle into
downtown Boston from a small airplane thwarted five different law
enforcement agencies with instant communications, state-of-the-art
helicopters and sophisticated radar.
   Murder suspect Alfred Hunter was captured early Wednesday when
he landed a stolen plane at Logan International Airport after a
three-hour flight, just five minutes before the Cessna would have
run out of fuel.
   Jet helicopters owned by state police could easily have
overtaken the Cessna, if officials had decided to use them, said
Trooper David F. Morrill.
   ``Why risk a helicopter chasing an armed person in an
airplane?'' Morrill asked. ``All a helicopter is going to be able
to do is follow him. We did that anyway with the radar. If you get
up there and engage in a shooting match, all you do is endanger
other people.''
   State police, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Massachusetts Port Authority which operates Logan Airport,
emergency response crews and three local police departments were
responded to Hunter's three-hour escapade.
   Airports all over Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire were
alerted.
   Like the feat of Mathias Rust, the 19-year-old West German who
flew through elaborate Soviet border security in a single-engine
Cessna and buzzed Red Square before landing there, Hunter's buzzing
the control tower at Logan Airport and swooping under the Tobin
Bridge stunned law enforcement officials.
   Longtime law enforcment officials said they had never seen
anything like it.
   ``We could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was
going to land,'' said Logan Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella. ``We
could only have made things worse by going up and chasing him.''
   ``What if you shoot the guy down and he crashes into a house or
something?'' said Morrill, noting that for much of the time Hunter
was flying low over heavily populated areas. ``It just isn't
feasible. You basically have to hope he runs out of fuel.''
   FAA officials tracking Hunter from Logan's control tower twice
had to scramble out of their perch because the Cessna came so close
they feared it would crash into the tower.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, an FAA spokesman in Washington.

<HEAD>Snowy Owls Gather at Logan International Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snowy owls, a solitary species of beautiful birds
from frozen tundra far to the north, are returning to their winter
home near one of the nation's noisiest airports and one of its most
polluted harbors.
   The unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and
an abundant food supply at the 1,800 acres of open field at Logan
International Airport, said Bradford Blodget, of the state Division
of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   ``Massachusetts is probably one of the best places in the entire
country to see snowy owls,'' Blodget said. ``Probably the largest
concentration in the state is out at Logan.''
   In addition to providing a curious counterpoint to the modern
surroundings, the white birds are doing their part to clean up the
much-maligned Boston Harbor by feasting on the water rats populating
the grasslands between the runways and the water.
   More than 35 of the solitary, 20-inch-long, often brown-specked
owls perched on radio towers and swooped silently out over the water
and runways during their last December-to-March visit.
   Norman Smith, of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, banded 36
snowy owls at Logan for the first time last season. The birds, which
travel individually, start their trek south in November and continue
to migrate until January.
   So far this year, Smith has sighted three birds. The small number
could be part of a migratory pattern, or more birds could come as
the season progresses, he said.
   Smith is the state's snowy owl expert, but he concedes it is
difficult to say what draws them from the quiet desolation of the
tundra in Greenland and northern Canada to the chaotic environment
of the airport.
   ``Nobody really knows why they migrate,'' Smith said. ``Some
people try to correlate it to the drop in the Lemming supply (which
the owls feed on), some try to correlate it to the weather.''
   Smith said he believes it's just a normal migratory pattern that
draws the snowy owls south to the airport, where the noisy planes
don't disturb the birds.
   ``For the most part they ignore them,'' he said. ``Owls have
sensitive hearing, but the jet noise doesn't seem to phase them at
all.''
   The owls go about their lives at the airport much like they would
in the barren expanses of home, with a few extra activities, Smith
said.
   ``They roost primarily on the ground. And they seem to be most
active just before sunset and very active at night,'' Smith said.
   Sometimes they perch amid discarded ramps, buses and structures
rusting in an isolated section of the airfield, and occasionally the
owls venture out to the harbor islands.
   ``In the evenings, I've actually seen them fly to downtown
Boston,'' Smith said, adding that the owls perch on roof tops and
eat the rats scurrying near open dumpsters in alleys.
   Although the noise from the planes doesn't bother the owls, Bob
D'Entremont, an airport employee since 1971 who has watched the
falcons, blue heron and geese that populate Logan, said the airport
is not always safe for the owls _ they often sit on the white lines
of the runways to blend in.
   ``We lose a couple a year. A couple get hit,'' said D'Entremont,
who said he has spotted snowy owls at Logan since 1975.
   Logan is not the only place snowy owls congregate in the United
States. The birds travel along the seaboard and live along marshes
and fields. A large seasonal population can be found at Plum Island
off Newburyport.
   A Logan owl was once tracked to Rhode Island, and John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York reports five or six snowy owls a
year.

<HEAD>Sky Sniper's Bizarre Flight Reminds Airport Operators Of Vulnerability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bizarre flight of an enraged ex-husband who
commandeered a Cessna and flew among city buildings while firing
randomly at the ground below reminded operators of small airports
of their vulnerablility.
   ``What can you do to prevent someone from going in and
terrorizing people?'' asked John Leyden, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman.
   ``You just have to play the odds,'' said Greg Chapman, manager
of the Beverly municipal airport where the gunman hijacked the
small plane. ``You go along for years and years and nothing
happens. Then all of a sudden everything goes haywire.''
   Alfred J. Hunter, who also is accused of murdering his ex-wife,
was arraigned Wednesday in Salem District Court on charges of
murder and armed robbery. Judge John Doyle ordered Hunter held
without bail for 20 days of psychiatric observation at Bridgwater
State Hospital.
   The sniper flight early Wednesday struck a chord among airport
officials struggling with security.
   The rampage began with the hijacking of the single-engine plane
at Beverly, about 20 miles north of Boston. The episode ended three
hours later at Logan International Airport, one of the nation's
largest facilities.
   At both facilities, the hijacker had officials backed into a
corner.
   In Beverly, flight instructor Robert Golder was alone and had
little choice but to comply with Hunter's demand for a plane.
   ``When you have an AK-47 (assault rifle) stuck up your nose and
someone ask you to provide an airplane, you just ask them what
color airplane they'd like,'' Amero said. ``It's wise to back off.''
   And during the flight, Hunter buzzed Logan and sent air traffic
controllers scrambling from the tower, closing the airport.
   ``Something like this was impossible to anticipate in terms of
security,'' said Phil Orlandella, a spokesman for Logan. ``And I'm
not sure there's a defense for it anyway. The whole city was
helpless.''
   Hunter's flight ended about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday when he landed
at Logan with about five minutes' worth of fuel left in his tank.
He had no comment, and authorities found no weapon in the plane
although several rounds and spent shell casings were recovered.
   Leyden said that ideally, stringent security measures would be
mandated at all of the nation's 15,000 small airports and landing
strips.
   ``But it would be impossible,'' he said. ``You really can't
prepare for events like these. I don't know what you could do in
the way of security without imposing a tremendous economic burden
on small airport operators.''
   Ralph Amero, who manages the Beverly Flight Center, whose plane
Hunter commandeered, agreed.
   ``At airports such as Beverly there really is no security,'' he
said. ``Generally speaking all we can do is band together as a
group of fixed base operators and try to hire security, but the
cost is prohibitive.''
   Bill Thomas, a senior claims representative at AVEMCO Insurance
Corp. said the Frederick, Md.-based small aircraft insurer, one of
the nation's largest, receives eight to 10 theft reports annually.
   Because a single-engine plane like a Cessna 210 is valued at
about $196,000, costs can quickly soar for insurers like AVEMCO,
which spends about $1 million annually in compensation for stolen
and damaged aircraft.
   ``The Boston incident was certainly an exception,'' he said.
``Naturally, we like to see solid security using the best
surveillance technology.''

<HEAD>$10.8 Billion Transportation Bill Heads to Reagan For Signature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress sent a $10.8 billion transportation
spending bill for 1989 to the White House on Wednesday, several
days after lawmakers made it veto-proof by removing language
airline labor unions had championed.
   The House gave final congressional approval to the measure on a
voice vote shortly after the Senate signed off on the bill with a
voice vote of its own. The House had given initial approval to the
measure Tuesday on a 392-13 vote, but had to consider it again
after the Senate made last-minute technical amendments.
   Reagan was expected to sign the legislation by Saturday, the
start of the 1989 federal fiscal year. It is the eighth
appropriations bill the president has received as lawmakers rush to
send Reagan all 13 spending measures before the new year begins.
   Last Thursday, House-Senate negotiators sliced labor-sought
language out of the bill that Reagan had said would cause him to
veto the entire measure.
   That provision, included in the House version of the bill
approved earlier this year, would have required airlines to pay
benefits to employees whose jobs are lost or whose incomes are
diminished due to mergers.
   Besides providing $10.8 billion in new spending for fiscal 1989,
the appropriations bill would allow the government to spend another
$14.7 billion on transportation programs, money that would come
from various federal taxes on fuel and air travel.
   The bill would funnel $3.2 billion to mass transit, $12.2
billion to highway programs, $6.3 billion to aviation and $2.8
billion to the Coast Guard. Among other things, it provides $584
million in grants for Amtrak, the national passenger railroad.
   The legislation not only would spend $2.6 billion more on
transportation than Reagan proposed in the budget he gave Congress
in February, but also rearranges the priorities he sought.
   In a battle that Reagan has waged with congressional Democrats
since the early 1980s, the president preferred dramatically less
spending for mass transit, slightly less for highways, slightly
more for aviation and no money at all for Amtrak.
   Despite those differences, the provision that most piqued the
president was the one protecting airline workers. Supporters argued
that in an era of frequent mergers, workers' jobs must be
protected. The administration considered it an intrusion into the
workings of the free market.
   The legislation contains sections that would block the
construction of a shopping mall in Manassas, Va., near the site of
two important Civil War battles, and prohibit the government from
withholding federal highway aid for states whose drivers disobey
the 55 mph speed limit. Legislation passed last year allowing
states to increase their speed limits to 65 mph dropped such
sanctions for those states.
   The measure would also allow Logan International Airport in
Boston temporarily to continue new, higher landing fees for small
airplanes to encourage them to use other airfields.
   The bill would allow Logan to continue receiving federal aid
until the federal Department of Transportation completes an
investigation of the controversial program. If the agency
determines that the Logan plan is illegal, government assistance to
the airport would be halted.

   What else can go wrong in the market for corporate and private planes? 

   In recent years, a series of credibility-damaging accidents has led to huge product-liability awards. 
Deregulation has sparked a boom in commercial air traffic that threatens to squeeze private jets out of major airports. 
Lagging technology, the soaring costs of buying and operating the planes, widespread corporate cost-consciousness and the woes of the industry's best customers -- the oil companies -- have also taken their toll. 

   And that was before Black Monday. 

   The stock market crash of last Oct. 19 has exacerbated the situation and threatens to dash, at least for now, any glimmering hope for recovery in the industry, which produced only about 1,000 planes in 1987, down from around 17,000 in 1979. 
If the decline persists, the general public is likely to feel the impact as well, particularly in rural areas where the big airlines don't fly anymore. 

   "We've got an industry that is sort of at an economic crossroads here," says Michael Moore, executive vice president of Executive Air Fleet, a PHH Group Inc. subsidiary that manages corporate aircraft fleets. 

   Nobody is predicting the demise of general aviation, the catchall description for a sector made up largely of private and corporate jets, but which also encompasses small commuter airlines. 
Some 211,000 small aircraft fill the air lanes these days, dwarfing the 4,600-plane commercial airline fleet and logging four times the flight hours. 

   "We're the biggest airline in the country by a hell of a margin," says John Baker, president of the Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Association. 
"If we're going to have a national aviation system, then we've got to be a part of it." 

   But the past decade hasn't been kind to the industry. 
Manufacturers' reputations and bottom lines were seriously damaged by a series of small-craft accidents. 
In 1986 alone, the industry shelled out $210 million in product-liability damages, up nearly tenfold from a decade earlier. (The industry is pushing for federal legislation that could offer some relief.) 

   Such liability awards have contributed mightily to the soaring expense of owning and operating small aircraft, as have rising fuel costs and increased landing and hangar fees. 
Moreover, the federal government last month increased to 23 from nine the number of airports requiring new radar equipment on small planes. 
Cost to private-plane owners: about $2,000 per plane. 
Executive Air estimates that annual operating costs currently range from $250,000 for a small turboprop to $1.5 million for a top-of-the-line corporate jet. 

   "We're getting plastered across the board on costs," Mr. Baker says. 
"There are damn few companies that can afford to operate the machines." 

   Indeed, many companies have dumped their aircraft in recent years. 
While 336 of the Fortune 500 companies still operate business aircraft, according to a recent survey by Wichita, Kan.-based Aviation Data Services, that's down about 10% in just four years. 

   The oil-patch depression has wreaked the most damage. 
In 1980, oil companies accounted for 20% of unit sales of new business jets; by 1986, they were providing just 8% of a shrunken sales base. 

   Ironically, private-aircraft manufacturers were seeing signs of a minor recovery just before the stock market crash. 
Used-plane prices had risen as the glut of older planes began to diminish, making new planes more price-competitive. 
Some technologically advanced new models were drawing increased interest. 
The snazzy Gulfstream IV, made by a Chrysler Corp. subsidiary and carrying a sticker price of $18 million, built up a 100-order backlog even before it was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration last year. 

   In addition, the commercial carriers' restructuring of their routes into hub-and-spoke configurations eliminated direct flights to many rural locales, forcing some companies to start private fleets. 
"We may need several changes of planes to get from here to Timbuktu if we fly commercial," says Ray Townsend, chairman of Des Moines, Iowa-based Townsend Engineering, which uses three planes to service its predominantly rural clientele. 

   But the market crash may have killed the nascent turnaround, as exemplified by the decision of General Dynamics Corp.'s Cessna Aircraft subsidiary to shut down production this month, idling 1,400 of its 3,900 workers. 
Cessna, the world's largest manufacturer of private aircraft, has also laid off 250 employees indefinitely and plans a reduced production schedule for February. 
Beech Aircraft Corp., a Raytheon Co. subsidiary, says it also has "noticed an effect" from the stock market crash in some product lines as customers have deferred orders. 
Manufacturers fear that, if a recession hits, the current run of deferred orders may quickly turn into a stampede of cancellations. 

   As if all that weren't enough, small aircraft are facing another serious problem -- finding room at the inn. 
The FAA has classified 16 U.S. airports as "seriously congested," and 42 others are expected to face capacity crunches by the year 2000. 
Proposed solutions have centered on diverting small craft to less convenient "reliever" airports. 
"We're getting pushed further and further out, and the utility is increasingly diminished," says Mr. Baker of the aircraft owners' group. 

   Pressure is mounting on several fronts. 
Last month, for example, the Massachusetts Port Authority proposed higher landing and terminal fees for small planes using Boston's Logan Airport. 
The authority is also contemplating higher fees for small planes landing during peak hours. 

   Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer of New York is pushing for federal legislation that would give scheduled airline flights preference at crowded airports. 
"The idea that a private LearJet should take precedence over a Boeing 747 with 300 people on it at a crowded airport makes no sense," he says. 

   Such moves could further weaken the small-plane market and cause a variety of ripple effects. 
"It could have a devastating impact on small communities," says Jonathan Howe, president of the National Business Aircraft Association. 

   For one thing, the proposals could hurt the commuter airlines servicing the rural routes that major carriers have abandoned in recent years. 
Should other agencies adopt plans similar to, say, the Massachusetts authority's proposal, commuter lines warn that they would face sharply increased costs and a choice between raising fares and drastically cutting service. 

   Moreover, some small companies say increased costs or new airport restrictions could force them to give up their planes and relocate to more urban areas, which would deal a blow to small airports and the communities they serve. 
"We would pack up our things and move to another city," says Greg Brown, president of Dr. Design Inc., a West Lafayette, Ind., consulting firm that uses business planes to visit clients in remote locales. 
Without small aircraft, he explains, "not only could I not operate, but many of them could not operate."

   A TWA jetliner with 114 passengers aboard lost
hydraulic power Saturday shortly after takeoff, and its pilot had to
lower the landing gear by hand when it returned to Lambert Airport,
an airline official said.
   In other incidents, a Northwest Airlines jumbo jet experienced a
loss of oil pressure after leaving Honolulu and another Northwest
aircraft lost power in one of two engines en route to Chicago,
officials said.
   All three planes landed safely, as did an American Airlines jet
that was diverted to Boston after losing one of its hydraulic
systems.
   In St. Louis, Flight 203 to San Diego made a safe landing about
30 minutes after its 9:40 a.m. takeoff, said TWA spokesman Don
Morrison. The pilot of the Boeing 737 reported a loss in hydraulic
power to the main landing gear, Morrison said.
   ``He manually lowered the gear, and landed routinely,'' Morrison
said.
   The 114 passengers were placed on other flights. The airplane was
back in service about 3{ hours later after workers replaced the
hydraulic line, Morrison said.
   On Friday, a TWA jet returned safely to Lambert after one of its
engines failed. A piece of the engine fell through the roof of an
auto-body shop, narrowly missing the store's manager.
   A Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 returned to Honolulu after it
started losing oil pressure in an engine shortly after taking off on
a flight to Osaka, Japan, an airline spokesman said.
   The flight, which had 400 passengers and 14 crew members aboard,
returned at 8:25 a.m., Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said by
telephone from Minneapolis, where the airline is based.
   A Northwest Boeing 757 flying from Detroit to Chicago landed at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after one of its two engines
shut down, Gibbons said. Fifty-six passengers and crew were aboard
the plane.
   An American Airlines Boeing 727 flying from Providence, R.I., to
Raleigh, N.C., with 83 passengers and a crew of seven aboard was
diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston after the
hydraulic system that controlled the plane's landing gear failed,
officials said.
   The pilot was able to switch to a backup system, and the plane
landed safely shortly after 2 p.m.
   The loss of the hydraulic system was caused by a valve
malfunction, said airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.
   On July 19, a United Airlines DC-10 lost its hydraulic system and
its pilot was unable to use the landing gear when he brought the
plane down in Sioux City, Iowa. Flight 232 touched down, cartwheeled
and burst into flames, killing 111 of the 296 people aboard.

   A British Airways flight bound for Miami from
London made an emergency landing at Logan International Airport on
Saturday after an anonymous caller threatened that a bomb would
explode in flight.
   The Boeing 747 jet landed without incident shortly before 3
p.m., said Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port
Authority.
   The 341 passengers and 19 crew members exited by a stairway that
had been wheeled to the plane on a runway apron away from the main
terminal. No injuries were reported.
   British Airways received the threat in London, about four hours
after the plane departed, said John Lampl, an airline spokesman. An
anonymous caller said a bomb aboard the jet was set to explode at
27,000 feet, but the plane was already at 31,000 feet above
Labrador in Canada.
   ``The threat had passed,'' Lampl said, but the plane's captain
decided to divert to Boston as a precaution.
   ``The most important thing is the safety of the passengers,'' he
said.
   After the plane landed, state police searched the aircraft with
the help of explosives-sniffing canines, but they found no
immediate sign of a bomb.
   Passengers were taken to the international air terminal, where
Lampl said they were going through customs and immigration and then
would be placed on other flights to Miami.

   A distraught man who allegedly had just killed his
ex-wife commandeered a small plane and held the city hostage for
three hours early Wednesday, firing a semiautomatic weapon while
flying within 50 feet of motorists and buildings.
   ``We could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was
going to land,'' airport spokesman Phil Orlandella said. ``We could
only have made things worse by going up and chasing him.''
   Traffic controllers at Logan International Airport said the
pilot buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the
airport for an hour and reroute several late-night flights.
Controllers fled the tower twice.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington.
   ``We didn't know if he was on drugs ... drunk, or if he was
suicidal,'' said Orlandella of the Massachusetts Port Authority,
which operates Logan. ``We had not one word of radio contact
throughout the whole flight.''
   Alfred J. Hunter, 42, pleaded innocent Wednesday in Salem to one
count each of murder and armed robbery after a midnight flight that
reportedly included a dip beneath a harbor bridge. Essex County
District Judge John T. Doyle ordered Hunter held without bail at
Bridgewater State Hospital for 20 days of psychiatric observation.
   Hunter made no comments when he was captured, police said.
   Bullets struck a variety of targets, including parked cars and
the Prudential tower's 50th-floor skywalk.
   One pedestrian was struck by ejected casings from the spent
rounds.
   FAA Field Manager Richard Fontz said Hunter was not a licensed
pilot but had apparently had some instruction from his father.
   ``It obviously wasn't the first time he flew an airplane,''
Fontz said.
   Hunter also repeatedly buzzed the post office where he worked,
Fontz said. ``The diving he was doing among the buildings and under
the bridge was something.''
   The sniper flight began at 10:20 p.m. Tuesday and for the next
three hours ambulance services tried to anticipate where the pilot
might land so they could prepare for possible injuries.
   Police in Boston received more than 200 calls from people
reporting the sound of gunfire. In suburban Lynn, police said two
cars were hit by a shower of shots believed fired from the
zig-zagging plane.
   Andrew Smith said he was walking along fashionable Newbury
Street in the city's Back Bay section when he heard popping noises
from the sky.
   ``About two seconds later, several shell casings landed all
around. At that point I realized that the guy was shooting out of
his plane,'' said Smith, who notified police. ``Nobody believed me
at first. I didn't believe it at first,''
   Trooper Barbara Bennett said officials decided to wait until the
gunman ran out of fuel rather than send up a state police
helicopter. If the plane had been shot at, she said, it could have
endangered the public.
   Hunter landed briefly at Logan at 12:57 a.m. but took off again.
He landed again 17 minutes later and was captured after a minor
scuffle, Bennett said.
   Two shell casings and two live shells were found in the
two-seater Cessna, which had about five minutes of fuel left.
Police found no weapon and said it probably was discarded during
the flight. They also said there was no way to tell how many shots
were fired.
   The ammunition was like that used in a semiautomatic assault
rifle such as an AK-47, said State Police Cpl. Joseph Howley. He
said it would not be possible to determine te type of weapon used
from the ammunition alone.
   Earlier Tuesday, Hunter, a mail handler, was given one year's
probation for assaulting his 26-year-old ex-wife, Elvira, in
December 1988 in an argument triggered when he ordered her not to
change a television channel.
   Hunter was convicted of assault and battery, making threats and
violating a restraining order his wife sought in January 1988. The
couple divorced in May 1988.
   Hunter's only previous criminal conviction stemmed from a 1979
incident in which he pleaded guilty to assaulting a group of people
with a machete. He told the court they tried to rob him, and was
sentenced to a year's probation.
   Police said they believe that on Tuesday night Hunter went to
his ex-wife's home and shot her in front of their 5-year-old son
before launching his aerial attack.
   Hunter then commandeered a car, and demanded and got a plane at
the small municipal airport straddling the Beverly-Danvers border
about 20 miles north of Boston.
   ``(It) was the last thing I was expecting. I was basically in
shock,'' said Robert Golder, 21, a flight instructor. ``He wanted
me to start the airplane for him. He told me not to do anything
stupid. He said he had just killed some people.''

<HEAD>Six Arrested for Disorderly Conduct on Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A husband-wife tiff aboard an airliner escalated
to a fight among several passengers and led to the arrest of six
people from the Continental Airlines plane at Logan International
Airport.
   ``They had a little brawl,'' state police Cpl. Joseph Howley
said of the weekend incident aboard an MD-80 jet with 146
passengers aboard.
   ``It started out as a husband and wife that were sort of running
around the plane and making demands on the crew and being a general
nuisance and hollering,'' Howley said.
   Officials available today were unable to say if blows were
exchanged on the flight Saturday, but said the husband struggled
with police who arrested him in the airport terminal.
   Facing arraignment today on a variety of charges are Steven
Sacks-Wilner, 39, attorney for Republicans in the New Jersey
Senate, and his wife, Joane, 37. Also arrested were a Medford,
Mass., family, Frank J. Federico, 50, his wife, Camella, 48, and
their son John, 22, and John's girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte.
   Sacks-Wilner is charged with interfering with a flight crew,
being a disorderly person and three counts of assault on a police
officer for allegedly resisting officers at the gate. The others
were charged with interfering with a flight crew.
   The Massachusetts State Police say the fracas aboard the flight
took place when the plane was in the air, and forced the pilot to
abort the landing Saturday evening.
   But airline spokesman Ned Walker insisted the fight took place
on the ground, and that the pilot aborted his first landing attempt
because another plane was slow to taxi out of the way.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigting, said
Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman in Boston. He said the agency was
told the pilot made a routine manuever for a second landing because
the plane ahead was slow to clear the runway.

A twin-engine private plane crashed today in a driveway between two houses in a 
crowded residential neighborhood, killing the president of a major urban 
development firm, his wife and daughter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash, which occurred in fog and light rain, also set the two houses on 
fire, but no one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Killed was Michael Spear, the president of Rouse Co., a downtown developer 
whose projects included the Harbor Place on the Baltimore waterfront, the 
Faneuil Hall shopping area in Boston, the South Street Seaport in New York and 
the revitalization of Underground Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Also killed were his wife, Judith, 47, and their daughter Jodi, 19. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the agency that runs Logan International 
Airport, identified Spear, 49, as the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine turbo-prop Piper Cheyenne was bound for Logan International 
Airport from the Cape Cod town of Chatham, the Federal Aviation Administration 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spear aborted his first approach to Logan about 6:24 a.m. because he could not 
slow the plane, the FAA said. Controllers told him to climb while circling west 
over Boston but Spear responded that his left engine was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The plane dropped off radar at 6:33 a.m., crashed and burst into flames in the 
driveway between the two single-family homes in the city's Mattapan section, 
setting both houses on fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the occupants of one house were away on vacation and that five 
people in the other house fled to safety. Neighbors said a man who lived in the 
house helped two women and two children escape out a window and suffered minor 
injuries in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Spear was president of Rouse Co., the largest publicly held real estate 
development company in the nation, since 1986.

   A federal investigation and one of the busiest
travel weekends of the year combined to make the Eastern Airlines
terminal at Logan International Airport a waiting room for hundreds
of frustrated travelers.
   The Eastern ticketholders were stuck at the airport Sunday for
the third consecutive day that Eastern flights into or out of
Boston were delayed or canceled by mechanical problems.
   ``I'd rather be sitting by the pool than sitting here,'' Jack
Honen said while he waited for his flight to Florida.
   Eastern, which is the focus of a Federal Aviation Administration
investigation into mechanical and safety problems, was trying to
cope with the crowds on one of Boston's busiest travel weekends of
the year.
   ``What you've got is spring break _ they're all headed down
South. You've got Patriot's weekend and you've got the Boston
Marathon. We're busy in and out,'' said Thomas Hannah, Eastern's
manager for departure services.
   Hannah said the delays and cancellations were typical of any
large airline on a busy weekend. ``There's nothing really unusual
about that. You can go to Delta or Piedmont or what have you and
find the same thing,'' he said.
   Piedmont, United and Continental experienced no significant
delays Sunday, reservations clerks reported. A clerk who answered
the phone at Delta said she could not provide any information.
   An incoming Eastern flight Sunday morning from Orlando, Fla.,
was canceled because of equipment problems that required servicing,
Hannah said. A flight from Boston to Miami was delayed several
hours after Eastern mechanics discovered a fuel leak. And a flight
from Boston to Orlando was delayed three hours.
   ``The mechanics found some engine vibrations. They're working on
it,'' Hannah said.
   Hannah said FAA inspectors were in Eastern's Boston hangars
Sunday looking over the airline's planes. But he said the problems
that led to delays and cancellations had been found by Eastern
mechanics, not the inspectors.
   Honen and his family, of Hanover, were among many heading to
Disney World.
   ``If they were responsible for paying for one day of your
vacation that you lost, maybe they'd get their act together,''
Claire Honen said. She passed time playing cards on the floor with
her two children.
   Earlier Sunday, Eastern officials rerouted several dozen
passengers to LaGuardia Airport in New York City because they were
trying to make connections with a Carribean cruise leaving from
Florida. The passengers had to board an Eastern Shuttle to New York
so they could reach Miami.
   Hannah, who is based in Florida, said he came to Boston to help
manage the busy weekend and handle press questions.
   Three Eastern flights out of Logan were canceled Saturday and
two Eastern jets were taken out of service Friday because of
equipment problems, delaying hundreds of travelers.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Sunday that
starting today, his agency was expanding its airplane-by-airplane
inspection of aircraft to Continental Airlines, like Eastern a
subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company.
   Last week, the FAA began checking Eastern, and fined Eastern
$823,000 for violating safety regulations, authorities said.
   On Wednesday, the agency also began examining the finances and
management of the Houston-based Texas Air. Burnley said the
agency's concerns were raised by evidence that Eastern and
Continental airlines ``are under substantial, increasing financial
pressure.''

<LEADPARA>  Federal safety officials and other witnesses Monday blasted the government's
slow-paced modernization of the nation's air traffic control system, saying
lives are at risk in the air and on the ground.;    Mayor Tom Bradley
criticized the Bush administration for using a $7 billion aviation trust fund
to balance the budget at the expense of passenger safety.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AGING AIR-CONTROL TECHNOLOGY PUTS LIVES AT
RISK, HOUSE PANEL IS TOLD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     People 'placed in danger';    "We cannot balance the budget of this nation
with the lives of the people who are placed in danger," Bradley told a hearing
of the House Government Activities and Transportation Subcommittee at Los
Angeles International Airport.;    Money from the trust fund, which pays for
such improvements as new radar, has been tied up by the federal budget
deficit. Originally intended to pay for airport capital projects, the fund has
bankrolled operating expenses.;    Spending the funds properly could prevent
the kind of runway collision that killed 34 people at the airport on Feb. 1,
Bradley told the committee.;    The hearing, chaired by Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-San Rafael, also looked at a runway collision at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport on Dec. 3 that killed eight people.;    "Two hundred-forty runway
incursions in a year is just not acceptable," Boxer said. The FAA defines an
incursion as a ground collision hazard.;    "Incidents like the LAX collision
always appear random at first, like bolts from the blue or acts of God, but
upon closer examination the pattern of unfortunate trends and occurrences
emerges," Boxer said.;    The LAX collision occurred when an air traffic
controller allowed a USAir jet to land after clearing a Skywest commuter plane
for takeoff on the same runway.;    National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) investigators said most of the 22 people who died in the USAir jet
survived the collision but died trying to escape smoke and fire in the cabin.;
   The NTSB found that a 20-year-old ground radar system at LAX was not
working and that the USAir jet cabin was not equipped with advanced fire
retardant materials.;    Matthew McCormic, chief of the NTSB's survival
factors division, testified the materials must be installed on all new
aircraft, but on older aircraft only when they are refurbished.;    That could
take up to seven years, NTSB official Richard Wentworth said. He added that
over the last eight years, LAX has been second only to Boston's Logan
International Airport in the number of runway incursions.;    In written
testimony, the NTSB said the best way to prevent ground collisions is to
install advanced radar and other equipment that alerts controllers and pilots
about impending collisions.;    Boxer noted that LAX's ground radar hadn't
been functioning for most of the three months before the runway collision.;   
New system being tested;    FAA official Joseph Del Balzo, who declined to
comment on the LAX or Detroit accidents, said the FAA is testing an advanced
new ground radar system in Pittsburgh.;    But technical problems have delayed
its installation by four years, he testified. The system won't be working at
LAX and Detroit until October 1992, he said.;    The LAX ground radar system
goes down for lengthy periods of time while officials seek spare parts or
cannibalize other equipment, Del Balzo said.;    Less-sophisticated ground
radar systems at 13 other major airports fail roughly once every eight days,
Del Balzo added.;    "I believe we have a very safe air transportation system
in the United States . . . but the system isn't perfect," Del Balzo said.;   
Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the Association of Flight Attendants,
criticized the FAA for failing to make it easier to escape airplane window
exits.;    Subcommittee members called on the Bush administration to
appropriate the aviation trust funds.;    "To me, virtually all of the deaths
on the USAir plane were preventable and never should have occurred," said Rep.
Mel Levine, D-Los Angeles.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Government Said Agents Got Test Bomb Through Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents carried a test bomb, hand grenade
and gun through American Airlines security at Logan International
Airport in 1987, the government charges in a lawsuit against the
airline.
   The lawsuit alleging 25 violations of federal regulations was
filed Thursday by Jeremiah O'Sullivan, the acting U.S. attorney for
Massachusetts.
   Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines at its corporate
headquarters in Dallas, said it would be inappropriate for him to
comment on the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit said that on June 22, 1987, a Federal Aviation
Administration inpsector went through the airline's X-ray system at
the airport ``with a test pipe bomb and a hand grenade in his
carry-on luggage.''
   Another agent had a gun in an attache case, the lawsuit said, and
``the screener, who was not paying attention to the screen while the
encapsulated weapon passed through the X-ray system, failed to
detect the weapon.''
   Test weapons are made of materials similar to real weapons and
should look the same on X-ray machines, the U.S. attorney's office
said.
   On the same day the agents made the tests, a federal agent saw 22
passengers go through American Airlines security ``without the
employee looking through the monitor,'' the lawsuit said.
   It also said only one employee was working the security gate that
day. Airlines are required to have both a monitor for X-ray machines
and a supervisor on duty at all times.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Robbins, who is handling the
case, said that under FAA procedures, airlines are notified of
security violations shortly after they are detected, and ``some are
filed (as civil complaints), and some are not.''
   The lawsuit seeks the maximum $1,000 fine for each of the 25
alleged security violations.
   Last December, a bomb planted on a Pan American jet exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the
ground.
   ``Passengers have a right to expect that the airlines to which
they are paying large amounts of money are taking their security
obligation seriously and are paying attention to what they are
doing,'' O'Sullivan said.
   Becker said American Airlines has ``very elaborate, very
rigorous'' security at every airport it serves, he said, but
acknowledged, ``I know nothing about our system at Logan in
particular.''
   Workers at the American Airlines desk at Logan declined to
comment.
   Becker said the airline has been fined for security lapses in the
past and that most airlines have some documented security violations.

   After a Trump Shuttle jet made an emergency
landing without its front gear, owner Donald Trump flew to Boston
to thank the pilot and try to turn a near-disaster into a public
relations triumph.
   ``I think the whole crew is made up of heroes,'' the New York
real estate baron said, singling out Capt. Robert Smith as ``a
great talent.''
   There were no injuries among the 47 passengers and seven crew
members on the Boeing 727, which came screeching into Logan
International Airport on its belly Thursday morning and stopped in
a shower of sparks.
   Smith, 47, a former Navy pilot with 19 years of flying
experience, realized the plane's nose gear failed to extend as he
approached Logan from New York City at about 9:30 a.m.
   He tried to free the landing gear by diving and pulling up
suddenly, and then by making a rough touch-and-go landing _
slamming the main landing gear on the runway and then taking off.
   When both attempts failed, the jet circled for nearly an hour
and dumped fuel over the ocean before finally making a gentle but
ungainly landing, with its nose scraping the pavement.
   Smith played down his efforts. ``This was all in a day's work as
far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
   The emergency landing was the first major problem for Trump
since he bought the shuttle from strike-torn Eastern Airlines on
June 8. He quickly tried to turn any safety fears to his advantage.
   ``I think the public confidence might be greater right now,
because of the talent of our crews,'' Trump said.
   The landing resembled an Aug. 2 incident in which a Piedmont
Airlines 737 scraped its wing and engine in an emergency landing at
Greensboro, N.C., after its left main gear jammed. No one was
injured.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle, said the jet had been
in service since January 1970 and was scheduled for a major
overhaul next month.
   ``Age has nothing to do with it,'' Nobles said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the
incident.

<HEAD>Report: Plane Landed on Wrong Runway at Boston Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wide-bodied passenger jet landed on the wrong
runway at Logan Airport in July, but the Federal Aviation
Administration had no record of the mistake, a newspaper reported
today.
   FAA officials have records of only seven of 20 ``runway
incursions'' at Logan reported to the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration during the first eight months of the year,
according to The Boston Globe.
   Barry Bermingham, FAA special projects manager for the New
England region, said an ``exhaustive search'' is under way to
determine why the agency was not aware of the July incident.
   He said it was possible the controller who handled the flight
decided the landing error did not create a safety hazard so no
report was filed.
   The incident was reported by the flight crew of the unidentified
commercial airliner to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System.
NASA gives those who file reports anonymity and immunity from
penalties for possible wrongdoing.
   The system is designed to create a large data base of potential
safety problems so aviation officials can correct problems.
   The report states the plane was cleared to land at Logan in
cloudy weather with visibility of 15 miles.
   The pilot was using computers and an automatic pilot to approach
the designated runway. But he landed the plane manually because the
computer did not capture the glide slope, which is needed for an
instrument landing.
   The pilot said he had no idea he had landed on the wrong runway
until afterward. No one was injured.

   With storms lashing the West and the Southeast and air fares
climbing today, many Americans headed home early for Thanksgiving to
get a jump on the busiest travel day of the year, and officials
braced for millions more.
   ``Everybody here knows it's going to be extra busy around this
time, so we put some extra people on,'' said Debra Ingram, a
spokeswoman at Newark (N.J.) International Airport, where traffic
was heavy Tuesday. ``Other than that, we just pray a lot.''
   The Western storm howled into Oregon with 75 mph winds and dumped
heavy rain on northern California on Tuesday, delaying San Francisco
flights up to two hours, causing officials in New York to hold
departures for that city and snarling commuter traffic.
   Four Trees, Calif., in the northern Sierra Nevada, received nine
inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 4 a.m. The rain was
expected to continue through tonight.
   In the East, Tropical Storm Keith hit Florida's west coast today
with 65 mph winds and heavy rain.
   Officials at major Florida airports did not expect the foul
weather to affect holiday travel. ``We anticipate the airplanes will
be able to slip by the storm on the side or fly over it,'' said Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport spokesman Jim Reynolds.
   The Western storm was expected to dump as much as 36 inches of
snow in the Sierra Nevada, including up to 18 inches around Lake
Tahoe, and leave heavy snow in most mountain areas of the West as it
spread to the northern Plains today. Wind gusts of more than 50 mph
were reported overnight in Redding, Calif.
   ``We've got about an inch (of snow) already,'' Trudy England, who
runs England's Lodging in Government Gamp, Ore., about five miles
south of Mount Hood, said Tuesday night. ``It's cold and snowing
steadily, so we expect more.''
   Eight inches of snow fell overnight at Stampede Pass in the
Snoqualmie National Forest of central Washington.
   Motorists in parts of the West were urged to check travel
conditions before setting out on long Thanksgiving journeys or to
prepare for mid-winter driving.
   Nationally, authorities were braced for a holiday jam of
motorists today. The Highway Patrol planned a ``turkey watch'' in
the desert outside Los Angeles for those violating speed, safety
belt and other traffic laws.
   The National Safety Council said 450 to 550 people may die in
traffic accidents between 6 p.m. Wednesday and midnight Sunday.
During a non-holiday, four-day weekend, about 390 people could
expect to be killed. Last year, 494 people died during Thanksgiving
weekend.
   For air travelers, the cost of flying went up at midnight Tuesday.
   The nation's biggest airlines went ahead with plans announced
last week to boost their lowest discount air fares and eliminate
cheap fares that can be booked a few days in advance. Among those
making the changes were United Airlines, American Airlines,
Northwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   The new fares were not expected to affect the volume of
Thanksgiving travel, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said at the
carrier's Atlanta headquarters.
   ``Those fares going into effect require advance purchase, so they
will be for later travel,'' Berry said. ``The people traveling this
weekend made their reservations some time ago.''
   Officials prepared for a flood of fliers.
   More than 200,000 passengers today were expected to pass through
the nation's busiest airport, Chicago's O'Hare International. On a
normal day, 120,000 to 150,000 use the airport. The Chicago Transit
Authority planned longer trains and more fare handlers for rides
from downtown to O'Hare.
   At Boston's Logan International Airport, 78,000 travelers were
expected, an increase of 30 percent from the normal number. The
Massachusetts Port Authority planned extra buses, vans and water
shuttles and urged fliers to ride instead of drive to Logan to
minimize airport traffic jams.
   At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, about 136,000
passengers were anticipated, up from 105,000 normally.
   At Newark International on Tuesday night, Zelder Hillard,
arriving from Charlotte, N.C., to visit relatives in Paterson, N.J.,
said 35 people couldn't make her flight from North Carolina because
of the crush of travel.
   Ms. Hillard said Piedmont Airlines offered passengers a free
round-trip ticket anywhere in the United States if they would give
up their seats.
   ``Most of the people seemed to want to get home,'' Ms. Hillard,
20, said. ``Only about three or four people gave up their seats.''

<HEAD>Eastern Strike's Effects In Airline's Major Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a city-by-city wrapup of the effects Sunday of the
3-day-old Eastern Airlines strike at key airports and transit
systems. Almost all Eastern flights were canceled Sunday; effects on
other airlines and mass transit were negligible.
   MIAMI: Pickets were held at Miami International Airport and
nearby Eastern corporate headquarters. No violence was reported.
Twenty flights left the airport on Sunday; normal daily schedule
calls for 100 departures. No reported problems at other airlines.
   FORT LAUDERDALE: All 24 flights canceled Sunday.
   ORLANDO, Fla.: Some 140 pickets were working in shifts, with 20
at a time at about a half-dozen locations. One flight departed
Sunday; on a normal day 31 flights are scheduled. No reports of
violence or problems at other airlines.
   TAMPA, Fla.: Machinists picketed minimally at six locations. No
Eastern flights out of 28 normal Sunday flights left.
   ATLANTA: Eastern's schedule at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport, the airline's largest hub, was extremely limited Sunday.
   At a rally of about 1,500 people across from Eastern's
maintenance headquarters, Jesse Jackson urged President Bush to use
his power to persuade labor and management to ``sit around a common
table.''
   BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON: Just four pickets at a time walked at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. No other carrier
employees joined in sympathy. Eastern said it had no flights out
Sunday. Ten are scheduled daily.
   Amtrak added 12 Metroliner trains today, and Greyhound Lines Inc.
planned special bus service in the Northeast and had 200 buses
deployed for extra duty.
   NEWARK, N.J.: A total of 60 pickets marched at Newark
International Airport. All 18 Eastern flights out of Newark were
canceled A ticket agent said passengers were being put on other
airlines with ``no problem'' and that no one had been stranded.
   NEW YORK: A federal judge signed a temporary restraining order
blocking sympathy strikes by railroad workers ready to join the
striking Machinists. The order covered the Long Island Rail Road,
Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit, which carry
about 320,000 commuters daily. Unions said they planned to honor the
order and Machinists nationwide agreed not to set up pickets.
   Forty Eastern workers, including several pilots, picketed outside
the Eastern terminal at LaGuardia Airport. Eighteen flights took off
Sunday. The Eastern terminal at Kennedy International Airport had
shut down operations, and about a dozen pickets walked in the rain.
   BOSTON: At least three Eastern flights departed Logan
International Airport, which normally handles about 100 Eastern
flights a day servicing 7,200 passengers. Some travelers were
successfully placed on other airlines. About 50 striking machinists
spread out at six picket locations.
   CHICAGO: All 15 Eastern flights from O'Hare International Airport
Sunday were canceled; airport police said strikers were peaceful and
hadn't set up picket lines at other airlines. An airport official
said other airlines were honoring Eastern tickets.
   HOUSTON: Eight people picketed at Hobby Airport, where Eastern's
four daily flights were canceled Sunday. No pickets appeared against
Eastern's sister carrier _ Houston-based Continental Airlines _
which operates a large hub at Houston's Intercontinental Airport.
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico: About 125 pickets at Munoz Marin
International Airport; Eastern said four flights took off Sunday,
equal to Saturday. The airline chartered four planes from
Continental on Sunday for cruise ship passengers.

   A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday extended an
order forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing ticket,
baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping strike-crippled
Eastern Airlines airborne.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland also barred striking
Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at Logan
International Airport in Boston.
   Separately, a federal appeals court in Miami told a lower court
to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots
back to work.
   Earlier, Continental Airlines' flight attendants terminated a
four-day strike that had little apparent effect on Eastern's sister
carrier.
   The developments came on the 21st day of a walkout by the
8,500-member Machinists union being honored by pilots and flight
attendants. Eastern is operating a limited schedule on its
Northeast shuttle and on Latin and South American routes.
   In New York, Eastern attorneys said in bankruptcy court that the
airline was negotiating with rivals to maintain interline
agreements that allow passengers and bags to make connecting
flights on different carriers.
   Eastern said that without cooperation among carriers, its few
services would be crippled. The pacts do not govern agreements with
other airlines honoring Eastern tickets purchased before the strike.
   Lifland granted a two-week extension to an order that
competitors honor the agreements.
   ``We've had very substantial discussions and negotiations with
the major carriers,'' said Eastern's vice president for marketing,
George J. Brennan. ``They're all willing to resolve this.''
   Lifland also barred picketing on a 150-yard-long sidewalk in
front of Eastern's terminal at Logan International Airport after
the airline complained Machinists were trespassing on private
property.
   In Houston, Union of Flight Attendants spokeswoman Myra Clayton
said the union was notifying flight attendants at Eastern's sister
airline, Continental, to return to work.
   Continental said no flights were disrupted or canceled because
of the walkout. It said 200 flight attendants took part; the union
reported more than 1,200 strikers.
   The union, which represents more than 6,000 flight attendants,
called the walkout Monday to protest what it said were substandard
wages and working conditions at the carrier.
   In Miami, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told a lower
court judge that he had the authority to rule whether the walkout
by Eastern's 3,600 pilots constitutes a primary or secondary strike.
   Eastern earlier this month asked the judges to overturn a lower
court ruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honor
striking Machinists' picket lines under the Railway Labor Act of
1926.
   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the
Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.
   It said U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis has the authority to
rule on what kind of strike the pilots are engaged in.
   The ALPA said it is buying advertising this weekend in major
newspapers in Miami, Atlanta, Washington, Boston and New York to
publicize its position and deter other pilots from going to work
for Eastern.
   The advertisement describes the alleged pitfalls of working for
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air. Corp.,
including limited career opportunities and low pay scales, and
says: ``Pilots choose your career opportunities wisely.''

   A Trump Shuttle jet carrying 56 people skidded to
a halt with a spray of sparks and smoke today in an emergency
landing at Logan Airport after its nose wheel failed to extend. No
injuries were reported.
   Fire equipment circled the plane and sprayed it with foam after
the Boeing 727 from New York's LaGuardia Airport ground to a halt.
Passengers slid down emergency chutes and walked to a waiting bus
for a ride to the terminal.
   ``When they first said they had problems, everybody was just
kind of joking about it,'' said a passenger, Charlie Cormay of
Sudbury. ``Once we realized there was going to be a crash landing,
everybody got pretty solemn.''
   As the plane came in for a landing, Cormay said, ``a few
prayers'' went through his mind. ``I looked out the window and saw
all the emergency vehicles. That's when I realized it was actually
pretty serious.''
   Before the landing, the plane circled nearly an hour, dumping
fuel. The pilot also tried to shake the wheel loose from its
housing by dropping the plane onto a runway, but the attempt failed
and the jet took to the air again.
   ``They made one sweep but it didn't shake loose,'' said Greg
Sullivan, 19, who watched the attempt.
   The plane circled several more times before smoothly dropping
its wing wheels to the runway in a gentle, but ungainly, landing,
its nose scraping the pavement.
   Passengers were told to put their heads in their laps as the jet
came in.
   ``They prepared us very well. By the time we landed, we were all
very happy and relieved,'' said Kathy Hussey of New York City.
``Suddenly you were on the runway with foam on your face and on
your back.''
   ``You prepare yourself for the worst,'' said another passenger,
Glenn Porter of New York. ``But it was really just like a rough
regular landing.''
   The jet carried 49 passengers and seven crew members, said Dee
Clark, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which
operates Logan.
   Developer Donald Trump inaugurated the Trump shuttle service
June 8 after buying planes and landing rights from Eastern Airlines
for $365 million. The shuttle operates between New York, Boston and
Washington.
   It was the second emergency landing in a little over a week in
the United States involving a landing gear problem.
   On Aug. 2, a Piedmont Airlines Boeing 737 with 100 people aboard
scraped its wing and engine at Greensboro, N.C., after its left
main gear jammed. No one was injured.

   A TWA flight aborted its takeoff this morning
after fire and smoke was detected in an engine, a Logan Airport
official said. Seven people suffered minor injuries during the
emergency evacuation of the plane.
   Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority,
which runs Logan Airport, said the crew aboard an L-1011 jet
abandoned its takeoff at around 9:30. The flight was bound for St.
Louis.
   Orlandella said the jet taxied off the runway and evacuation
chutes were deployed to help 163 passengers get off the plane.
There was also a crew of 13 on board. Seven people were slightly
injured, he said.
   MassPort crews found no smoke or fire when they inspected the
engine, he said.

   A Northwest Airlines jet with 182 people
on board made an emergency landing Saturday at an airport after the
pilot shut down one engine because of an oil leak. There were no
injuries, officials said.
   The 757 was on the way from Minneapolis to Seattle when it
landed safely at Billings Logan International Airport with one
engine, said Tom Binford, assistant airport manager.
   The plane had developed an oil leak in the right engine and
apparently was losing oil pressure when it landed, Binford said.
   The plane landed safely about 4 p.m., he said.
   Passengers went on to Seattle on other flights, a Northwest
spokeswoman said.
   Big jets like the 757 normally don't land in Billings because
there are not enough potential passengers, but the airport's
runways are wide and long enough to accommodate them, Binford said.

   A federal judge rejected a lawsuit over a failed leveraged
buy-out in one of the first court tests of whether former
shareholders can be held accountable when a transaction goes
bust.
   The suit was brought by Craddock-Terry Shoe Corp., now in
bankruptcy court in Lynchburg, Va., against former directors
and other shareholders who sold the company to a buy-out
group in 1986. The company claimed that the selling
shareholders were paid such a high price for their stake that
the surviving company couldn't possibly pay off its resulting
debts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But after considering written evidence and holding
hearings, U.S. District Judge Jackson L. Kiser of Lynchburg,
Va., ruled that the defendants couldn't be compelled to
return the cash they received in the deal. Bankruptcy lawyers
said that the ruling is likely to be cited by defendants in
other such cases, few of which have reached the trial stage.
   While Virginia's law is slightly different from that in
other states, the Craddock-Terry case is similar to cases
pending over the failed buy-outs of Revco D.S. Inc. and
Wieboldt Stores Inc., among other companies. In such
"fraudulent conveyance" cases, the plaintiffs generally
allege that people who benefited from a buy-out did so with
the knowledge -- or the reason to know -- that the resulting
company wouldn't be able to survive.
   Under Virginia law, the judge said, a suit can't succeed
unless the company received nothing of legal value for what
it paid to buy out former shareholders or unless the
participants intended to commit fraud at the time of the
transactions. In this case, he said, the company received new
management and an infusion of capital. "While the investment
did not work out well for {the buy-out group's} creditors, it
was neither fraudulent nor unlawful at the time it occurred,"
the judge wrote.
   Virginia Powell, a Richmond lawyer representing the former
Craddock-Terry directors, said the court's decision indicates
that "a transaction cannot be set aside merely because the
deal was highly leveraged and the surviving company performed
poorly."
   The Craddock-Terry suit was brought against 45 of its
former shareholders who received amounts ranging from $6,000
to $6 million each in the leveraged buy-out. The successor
company, C-T of Virginia Inc., has been in Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings since 1987 and hasn't filed a plan of
reorganization.
   Harold Bonacquist, the New York lawyer for the company,
said his client hasn't decided whether to appeal. He said
that while the decision "is not good news for plaintiffs in
Virginia," it did not have wide implications for litigation
involving failed buy-outs. But Sandra Mayerson, a New York
lawyer who is a court-appointed examiner in the Interco Inc.
bankruptcy proceedings, said that if other courts follow the
judge's ruling, it will make it difficult for plaintiffs to
win.
   Ms. Mayerson also noted that Judge Kiser considered each
element of the buy-out separately, such as the bank's
financing of the deal, the creation of a buy-out company,
shareholders' tendering of their stock and actual payment to
shareholders. He found that each element, taken by itself,
was properly structured and that there was no broader
evidence of fraudulent intent on anyone's part.
   In contrast, Ms. Mayerson said, some other courts have
said that all the elements of a deal should be considered
together to determine whether the overall effect is to render
the company insolvent. She said Judge Kiser's view, if widely
adopted, would mean that properly structured deals couldn't
be attacked even if the overall effect of the transaction was
to leave the company insolvent.

   POWER FAILURE spawns lawsuit by businesses claiming
losses.
   A group of small businesses on the island of Oahu sued
Hawaiian Electric Co. to recover $75 million in damages
including lost profits allegedly caused by an islandwide
electric power failure that lasted up to 12 hours on April 9.
   Five plaintiffs, including four restaurant concerns and a
laundry machine company, are seeking certification of the
suit as a class action. The class would include all of the
utility's business customers on Oahu, said plaintiff attorney
Paul Devens.
   The suit, filed Friday in state court in Honolulu, accuses
the utility of negligence and breach of contract. The
blackout occurred because Hawaiian Electric failed "to
properly maintain its utility easements . . . including
control of natural growth of trees that came in contact with
electric wires and lines," the suit states.
   A spokesman for the utility's parent, Hawaiian Electric
Industries Inc. of Honolulu, said that investigations into
the cause of the outage are continuing, but that the
"probable cause" was trees that interfered with power lines.
The company's general counsel declined to comment on the
suit.
   Customer lawsuits against utilities resulting from power
outages are rare, but not unprecedented, said a spokesman for
the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington trade group. Most
failures are due to storms and other natural causes that
aren't legal torts, he said.
   Commonwealth Edison Co. said it has agreed to settle two
class-action lawsuits stemming from power outages last summer
in Chicago for a total of about $4 million. The utility
didn't admit any liability, but settled to avoid protracted
litigation and legal fees. Consolidated Edison of New York
said it paid out a total of $2 million to settle more than
550 cases brought after a 1977 blackout in New York.

   JUDICIAL CANDIDATE wins fight to express views during
campaign.
   A federal judge in Philadelphia struck down a Pennsylvania
law that severely restricted what judicial candidates could
tell voters about their legal or political views. The law was
patterned after a model code of judicial conduct drafted by
the American Bar Association in 1972 that was adopted to
varying degrees by states that elect trial judges.
   Samuel C. Stretton, a lawyer and candidate for a seat on
the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, challenged the
law as an unconstitutional violation of his right to free
speech. Mr. Stretton said the law prevented him from stating
his position on key political and social issues.
   The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania -- represented by the state Attorney General's
Office -- contended that the law was valid because it
prohibited candidates from committing themselves on legal and
political issues that they might have to rule on as judges.
   U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer of Philadelphia,
however, ruled that the law's restrictions were too broad and
too vague. The ruling applies only to the Pennsylvania law,
although it may encourage challenges in other states. "There
are an array of less restrictive means to preserve the fact
and appearance of judicial impartiality which do not impose
an unconstitutional restriction upon a judicial candidate's
First Amendment rights," the judge said in his opinion.
   Judge Newcomer upheld the section of the law that bars
candidates from personally soliciting campaign funds.

   AIRPORT DISPUTE over landing fees is settled.
   The settlement of a class-action suit involving landing
fees imposed on small aircraft at Boston's Logan Airport will
provide plaintiffs with about $3 million.
   The dispute stems from a plan instituted by the
Massachusetts Port Authority in 1988 to reduce congestion by
inducing commuter airlines and private planes to switch to
other airports in the Boston area. The program prompted a
flurry of litigation brought by operators of small aircraft
arguing that the increased landing fees were discriminatory.
   The litigation was closely watched because other large
airports face problems similar to Logan's and because the
Port Authority's revised fees were based not just on
equipment weight, the traditional standard, but also on
operational costs.
   In late 1988, the U.S. Department of Transportation ruled
that the fees were unlawful, and that decision was upheld by
a federal appeals court. Some 20 commuter airlines and the
operators of six or seven thousand other airplanes that seat
fewer than 30 people will be entitled to refunds, according
to Raymond J. Rasenberger, of the Washington law firm
Zuckert, Scoutt &amp; Rasenberger, who represented the small
aircraft operators.
   Roscoe Trimmier, a partner at the Boston law firm Ropes &amp;
Gray, said that his client, the Port Authority, has an
"informal understanding" with major carriers that it will be
reimbursed for a portion of the settlement.

   UNEMPLOYED LAWYERS are offered extra training by a law
school.
   Fordham University School of Law, reflecting the
marketplace realities of the lean '90s, is cutting a special
deal for lawyers hit by the recent wave of layoffs. The law
school will charge lawyers only $25 for continuing legal
education courses, intended to help practicing lawyers keep
abreast of changes in various practice areas. Typically, the
fees for the courses range from $65 to $200.
   "The courses won't make them experts," said Ronne Kaplan,
director of Fordham's continuing legal education office. "But
outside of being trained in a firm, there really isn't a way
for a lawyer to learn a new discipline."

   NOTED: After delivering a 10-minute argument in a case
before the U.S. Supreme Court, Attorney General Dick

<HEAD>Boston Student Wakes Up in Ypsilanti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A fifth of vodka goes a long way. Adil Altom Hamza
drank most of one in Boston and woke up in a cargo plane on his way
to Ypsilanti, Mich.
   ``I'm drunk,'' he told Michigan State Police officers when he
walked off the four-engine Lockheed Electra at Willow Run Airport
in Ypsilanti at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   The troopers were there because the pilot, startled in
mid-flight by the appearance of Hamza radioed that he had a
stowaway.
   Hamza, a 27-year-old student from Sudan, told The Boston Globe
he drank most of a bottle of vodka while wandering Boston streets
alone Tuesday night, took public transportation to Logan
International Airport and got on a plane.
   ``I had a few drinks too many. All I can remember is looking for
a place to sleep,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The place he found was the cargo hold of the Zantop Airlines
plane, and that's where he woke up, scared and surprised, he said.
   ``It was dark. There were boxes all around me. It was freezing.
There was nothing there, just the feeling of flying. I thought it
was a nightmare.''
   He went through a door leading into the plane's cabin and tapped
on the shoulder of the flight engineer, one of three crew members,
to ask where he was.
   ``They were scared. Really scared,'' Hamza said. ``They thought
I was going to hijack the plane. But I said, `It's OK, I'm drunk.'
When the pilot said, `You are halfway across the U.S.,' I said, `Oh
my God.'''
   A half-hour later, the plane landed in Ypsilanti. State troopers
questioned Hamza and then let him sleep it off in the state police
lockup. Later they got him a bed at the Shelter Association of Ann
Arbor, and he slept 12 more hours.
   The Massachusetts Port Authority, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the FBI are trying to find out how Hamza evaded
security and got on the plane.
   Hamza, of Brookline, Mass., came to Boston more than three years
ago to attend the University of Massachusetts. He took off a term
this year and hopes to transfer to Northeastern University in the
fall, he said.
   Meanwhile, he is trying to find a way back to Boston. ``They are
going to let me sleep here, and they are feeding me,'' he said.
``Everyone is nice. I'm just trying to find a way back home now.
I'll work or take donations.''
