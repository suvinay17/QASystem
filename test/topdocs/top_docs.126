RESEARCH: THOUSANDS WHO SUFFER FROM THE SYNDROME, AND THEIR DOCTORS, CLAIM IT'S 
CAUSED BY A VIRUS. BUT RESEARCHERS SAY THE SYNDROME IS RARE, IF IT EXISTS AT

<TEXT>
<P>
Years after it first grabbed headlines and became a popular talk-show subject, 
chronic fatigue syndrome continues to raise more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
Is it a new, media-made illness or is it 100 years old? Is it common or rare? 
In the search for its underpinnings, is medical technology on a witch hunt or 
is science closing in on a complex crippler? 
</P>
<P>
Medical researchers at the University of Connecticut claim to have largely 
answered those questions and helped scores of CFS sufferers recover. 
</P>
<P>
Their finding: chronic fatigue syndrome, formerly known as chronic Epstein-Barr 
virus syndrome, is rare if it exists at all. Most of the patient-reported 
symptoms attributed to the syndrome -- exhaustion, fever, swollen glands, 
disturbed sleep and fogged thinking, all occurring or recurring for months or 
years on end -- are the result of treatable psychiatric disorders, particularly 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
Far from settling the matter, their reports and those by others with similar 
findings have further fueled a heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
"To say this is psychological is bull," snaps Dr. James Jones, a senior staff 
member at the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in 
Denver. He says he has seen nearly 2,000 people suffering from CFS. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has co-authored the CFS "working case definition," arrived at in March, 
1988, after elevated antibodies in response to the Epstein-Barr virus proved to 
be a false lead in the hunt for a cause and an agreed-upon diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers argue that CFS sufferers first become physically sick from an 
as-yet-unidentified virus that causes chronic flu-like symptoms. Depression is 
a common symptom of CFS, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as the University of Connecticut researchers, say people with CFS 
symptoms start with a history of recurrent mental illness, including 
depression, panic attacks and other disorders. Their physical symptoms then 
emerge from patients' unspoken "psycho-emotional conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the CFS debate agree that most people who go to doctors 
complaining of persistent tiredness are probably suffering from a treatable 
mental illness, such as depression. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agree that CFS, or the illness that people are now calling CFS, 
is probably not a new disease. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of a similar plaguing fatigue, then labeled neurasthenia, first emerged 
in the United States in the mid-1800s, notes Dr. Peter Manu, lead author of the 
studies by the University of Connecticut researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Similar symptoms have since been attributed to Iceland disease, chronic 
brucellosis and, in England, benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But here the two sides of the debate part company. 
</P>
<P>
Manu says that neurasthenia, still a common diagnosis in other countries, gave 
way to psychiatric diagnoses in the 20th-Century United States. He thinks it 
was wrongly revived as CFS in America in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1985, two articles in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that 
patients suffering from chronic fatigue showed a persistent infection from the 
Epstein-Barr virus as measured by certain antibody levels in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
In some people, the Epstein-Barr virus causes mononucleosis, with its weeks or 
months of fevers, swollen glands and exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, however, doctors found that some healthy people were walking 
around with the same antibody levels as those people chronically fatigued. 
Morever, many people suffering from what seemed like chronic mononucleosis did 
not show high antibody levels. 
</P>
<P>
But by then it was too late, Manu says. Patients were rushing to doctors, 
newspaper clippings in hand, seeking a physical diagnosis for an illness that 
was probably psychological. 
</P>
<P>
In Manu's view, doctors were too pressed for time to do the extensive 
interviews necessary to make a psychiatric diagnosis. Or perhaps they were 
uncomfortable broaching the idea of mental illness with patients. 
</P>
<P>
Since testing for certain Epstein-Barr antibodies had recently become 
commercially available, doctors were able to give patients the technological 
fix they sought. 
</P>
<P>
Although those antibody counts proved imprecise and largely irrelevant, in this 
age of AIDS, both medical and popular thought focused on a viral cause for 
chronic fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you had millions of people that for about two years, 1986 to 1987, 
believed they had chronic Epstein-Barr virus, and all of a sudden that was 
taken away from them," Manu says. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is that (CFS) need not be produced by a virus but is . . . 
associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders," says Manu, who 
says he has seen 200 patients with the syndrome's symptoms since he and two 
other doctors set up the University of Connecticut's Chronic Fatigue Clinic in 
late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees that people catch CFS from magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the knee-jerk reaction is to call anything that we don't understand, 
or that we can't prove is organic by the definition of the day or the 
technology of the day, 'psychiatric.' And I don't think that's right," Dr. Paul 
Cheney says. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior staff physician at the Nolle Clinic in Charlotte, N.C., Cheney says 
he has seen 1,000 patients with chronic fatigue in the past three years. He is 
following 500 people from that group, analyzing them over time for immune 
system and neurological abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
"They have enough objective abnormalities that they could not manufacture 
through psychic means," Cheney says of the majority of those patients. 
</P>
<P>
And he adds, "Between the years 1980 and 1984, the only thing we could find in 
AIDS patients was disturbed immune function and a menagerie of other infections 
that didn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
Both Cheney and Dr. Anthony Komaroff, chief of general medicine at Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in Boston, say they will soon publish studies showing immune 
system dysfunction in CFS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Measurable immune system abnormalities, which Cheney says have been reported in 
other countries' medical journals, could provide a more clear-cut and readily 
accepted diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney concedes, "There isn't a single test within this immunologic profile 
that we do that is always abnormal in CFS patients."

<HEAD>Doctors Should Rule Out Look-Alike Diseases in Mysterious Fatigue
Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should rule out a long list of ills, such
as AIDS and alcoholism, before they decide patients are afflicted
with a baffling, newly recognized ailment called chronic fatigue
syndrome, researchers say.
   In the past, the illness has been referred to as the yuppie
disease, because some of its victims are young professionals, or
more formally, Epstein-Barr virus syndrome or chronic mononucleosis.
   In a report published in the March issue of the Annals of
Internal Medicine, 16 top researchers in this field agreed to call
it chronic fatigue syndrome, and settled on a definition for the
afflication.
   The definition largely involves ruling out other illnesses that
can cause similar symptoms, including the hallmark of the syndrome,
extreme fatigue.
   ``It's a diagnosis of exclusion, and it has to be considered as
such even after you've ruled everything else out,'' said Dr. Gary
P. Holmes, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and chief author
of the report.
   ``You have to continue to be concerned that there is something
else going on,'' he added. ``You have to keep an open mind and not
simply close the books.''
   Another co-author, Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, said the new definition should help
researchers as well as doctors who are faced with patients who have
heard of the illness and think they have it.
   ``Many of them have other physical illnesses, or they are
depressed or anxious,'' he said. ``Doctors need an anchor to help
distinguish patients with chronic fatigue syndrome from patients
who have other kinds of fatigue.''
   According to the definition, people with the syndrome must have
suffered debilitating fatigue for at least six months. It must be
bad enough to reduce daily activity by at least half.
   Doctors also must rule out a long list of diseases that can
mimic the symptoms of the syndrome. These include cancer,
tuberculosis, AIDS, depression, diabetes, alcoholism, poisoning and
kidney disease, among many other disorders.
   In addition, patients must show signs of at least eight of 11
other possible conditions. These are mild fever, sore throat,
painful lymph nodes, generalized muscle weakness, muscle
discomfort, headaches, painful joints, sleep problems, sudden onset
of the symptoms, such neurological problems as trouble
concentrating, confusion or forgetfulness and general fatigue
lasting at least 24 hours after exercise that the patient easily
could have withstood when healthy.
   When the disease first received widespread attention three years
ago, doctors believed it was somehow linked with the Epstein-Barr
virus, because some victims showed signs of activation of that
common virus. However, many experts now say that Epstein-Barr virus
is not associated with the illness, since victims are just as
likely to show exposure to the viruses that cause measles, genital
herpes and cold sores, among other things.
   Although the CDC has received thousands of questions about the
illness from patients and doctors, no one knows how many people
have it.
   Its cause also is a mystery. Some believe it can be triggered by
persistant infections with a variety of viruses. Among the suspects
are a group of microbes called the enteroviruses as well as a newly
discovered virus known as human herpes virus 6.
   Researchers suggest it's a reaction to these lingering
infections rather than the mischief of the viruses themselves that
makes people feel poorly.
   ``My theory is that certain viruses are able to escape ever
being fully eradicated by the body,'' said Komaroff.
   ``They come back to fight again. You have a constant Iran-Iraq
war where the battles are continual. The process of doing battle
and mobilizing the body's immune system causes some of the symptoms
of feeling ill.''
   Holmes noted that the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome are
similar to those experienced by people treated with the natural
hormone interferon.
   ``Interferon is the body's normal response to a viral
infection,'' Holmes said. ``It may be that something like
overproduction of interferon for a prolonged period may be causing
the illness.''

<HEAD>Epstein-Barr Virus May Trigger Rare Anemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Epstein-Barr virus that causes
mononucleosis also may trigger a rare form of anemia that can lead
to death, scientists reported Tuesday.
   The DNA, or genetic code, of the Epstein-Barr virus has been
found in the bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia,
researchers report in this week's Philadelphia-based Annals of
Internal Medicine.
   In patients with that disease, usually young adults, the bone
marrow quits functioning and fails to produce enough red blood cells
to carry oxygen through the body.
   While unlikely to be a common cause of bone marrow failure among
those who lack a history of infectious mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr
virus, or EBV, must be considered as a possible cause of aplastic
anemia, the authors wrote.
   According to the lead researcher, Dr. Bruce Baranski, a
hematologist at the University Wisconsin at Madison, aplastic anemia
afflicts about 200 people a year in this country, usually a few
months after a bout of mononucleosis.
   Treatment requires drugs, and not all patients survive.
   The authors said the research suggests three possible mechanisms
for how Epstein-Barr infects the bone marrow:
   _The virus could directly attack and kill bone marrow cells.
   _It could cause the immune system to turn against the bone
marrow, shutting down the production of blood cells.
   _Other viruses may aid Epstein-Barr in causing the anemia, as
occurs in patients with AIDS, a disease involving a compromised
immune system.
   James Jones, a pediatric immunologist at the National Jewish
Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in Denver, said the
new research ``takes you one step closer'' to understanding the
causes of aplastic anemia.
   He said the research eventually could lead to a form of therapy
directed toward the virus or a treatment aimed at suppressing an
immune system that has turned against itself. ``It could be that
aplastic anemia is secondary to an overzealous immunosuppressive
system,'' he said.
   The researchers began their study in late 1985 after treating a
patient who had severe aplastic anemia following a bout of
mononucleosis. Based on prior research, they suspected Epstein-Barr
might play a role in the anemia and found traces of the virus's DNA
only in the patient's bone marrow.
   According to Yale epidemiologist James Niederman, who discovered
that Epstein-Barr causes mononucleosis in 1968, almost all adults
have been infected with it at some time.
   Niederman said the report published Tuesday confirmed
researchers' suspicions that Epstein-Barr might play a role in
triggering aplastic anemia.
   Researchers also have linked Epstein-Barr to chronic fatigue
syndrome, the so-called ``yuppie flu,'' but the association between
the virus and the syndrome remains unclear.
   Baranski said the researchers studied five patients treated for
aplastic anemia at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center
and one at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   All had traces of the virus in their bone marrow and several had
experienced mononucleosis, he said.
   The researchers also reviewed the cases of 40 prior patients with
aplastic anemia and other blood diseases and found traces of the
virus, Baranski said.

   Researchers said they found evidence of brain inflammation
and an active form of herpes virus in people suffering from
chronic fatigue syndrome.
   The study, conducted on 259 patients involved in an
outbreak of the ailment in Incline Village, Nev., from 1984
through 1986, shows clear physiological differences between
chronic fatigue patients and a group of healthy people who
served as controls. It adds to mounting evidence that an
immune system dysfunction underlies the condition. But the
report, in today's issue of Annals of Internal Medicine,
offers no new clues on what causes the mysterious illness.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Incline Village cases brought chronic fatigue syndrome
to public attention in the mid-1980s, sparking what has
become a major and controversial medical mystery involving
scientists, doctors and patients caught in a debate over
whether their symptoms are real or imagined. The symptoms
include severe and prolonged fatigue, muscle and joint pain
and neurological problems. Many are bed-ridden or otherwise
unable to work or perform other basic tasks. Thousands of
people are believed to be affected, but the extent of the
illness is unknown.
   The new study found evidence of an active virus called
human herpes virus-6, or HHV-6, in 70% of a group of the
Incline Village patients, compared to 20% in people who
served as controls. And brain scans showed abnormalities
believed to indicate inflammation in 78% of the patients,
compared with 21% of controls.
   "The results clearly establish that in this group of
people there was a measurable physical {condition} that was
underpinning their symptoms," said Anthony L. Komaroff, a
researcher at Harvard Medical School and Brigham &amp; Women's
Hospital, Boston, and leader of the group that performed the
study.
   People are usually exposed to HHV-6, one of several herpes
viruses, early in life, in casual contact with family
members. It sometimes causes roseola, a brief fever and rash,
in childhood; some people get infectious mononucleosis.
   "Most people exposed to the virus never get anything," Dr.
Komaroff said. "The body contains it and it remains dormant."
But it can be reawakened in certain conditions, and his
research group believes "some subtle immune deficiency"
apparently allows its reactivation and replication in chronic
fatigue patients.
   Since most people are exposed early in life, the virus
probably isn't the actual cause of the syndrome. Dr. Komaroff
believes several agents, ranging from allergies to a virus to
other environmental factors, may be the trigger.
   Dr. Komaroff said the study clearly differentiates people
with the syndrome from many people who walk into a doctor's
office complaining of a lack of energy and who often suffer
from depression. The syndrome itself almost always begins
"like a bolt out of the blue" after a bout with the flu, he
said.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Link Between Mood and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moods of anger and depression have been implicated
in chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating weakness sometimes
called the ``yuppie disease,'' according to a report today.
   ``It is possible that mood itself is one of the factors in the
development of this syndrome,'' said Dr. Stephen E. Straus. ``People
who have certain emotional makeups may be more predisposed to get
this syndrome than others.''
   Doctors have searched unsuccessfully for a viral cause of the
illness, which is especially likely to afflict well-off young
professionals. A theory that it results from the Epstein-Barr virus,
which causes mononucleosis, has largely been abandoned.
   Some doctors had noticed that acyclovir, a drug used against
Epstein-Barr virus, seemed to relieve the syndrome. The latest study
was conducted to see if it worked.
   The researchers found that those who took acyclvir frequently
improved, but so did a comparison group that received placebos.
   The study found that the only factor that could clearly be linked
to improvement was mood. As people's moods improved _ especially
their feelings of anger and depression _ their fatigue also lessened.
   Straus said the latest findings do not mean that the syndrome is
imaginary. Instead, the symptoms may be caused by the influence of
people's moods on their hormones and immune defenses.
   ``I think it is very possible that a person's psychological
makeup could have a real impact on the expression of diseases,'' he
said.
   He noted that people with some personality types appear to be
less likely to survive heart attacks or cancer.
   ``You have to ask how that would work,'' he said. ``It's possible
that there is a psycho-immunological or metabolic link, and that may
exist in this syndrome, as well.''
   The latest study, directed by Straus at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Twenty-seven adults took part in the study. Neither they nor the
researchers knew whether they were getting acyclovir or dummy drugs.
Of the 24 who finished the study, 11 who took acyclovir and 10 who
took placebos said they felt better.
   In most of them, the perception of improvement lasted two or
three weeks after the treatment ended. However, four said their
improvement lasted for at least a year. Three of these four had
received placebos.
   Many of the patients were surprised by the study's results. Some
were relieved, others dismissed the findings.
   Straus said that some of the results are reassuring. For
instance, the research found that people with the syndrome do not
grow steadily worse. Instead, the symptoms come and go and can
disappear for years.
   The link between mood and the syndrome is controversial. The
study does not prove that people get better because their moods
improved. In fact, Straus said that the opposite might be true.
   ``It could not be determined whether their moods improved because
they felt better or they felt better because their moods improved,''
said Straus. ``Both are possible.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Morton N. Swartz of
Massachusetts General Hospital said it's likely that the syndrome
will prove to have mental and physical causes.
   Straus said that even though the illness has been formally
recognized as a syndrome, it is not new. He said there are accounts
of similar afflictions in the medical literature dating to the 1700s.

CHRONIC FATIGUE: A MYSTERY UNRAVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN LIBMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Jay Goldstein of Anaheim Hills has spent the last five years researching 
and treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating disease 
characterized by incapacitating exhaustion and a range of other perplexing 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his theory of an unknown retrovirus invading the immune system, 
inducing cells to produce a chemical transmitter affecting the entire body, 
Goldstein pauses. "You know," the family practitioner says, "some very 
respected physicians will tell you I am crazy." 
</P>
<P>
That's because in posing a medical explanation for the existence of chronic 
fatigue syndrome -- a disease with no known cause or cure -- Goldstein is 
bucking conventional wisdom. For years now, many in the medical community have 
regarded the ailment as primarily psychological, and they are wary of 
practitioners who pose unproven medical theories. 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, a growing number of the nation's most respected scientists are 
taking the illness very seriously, researching various hunches and theories of 
their own, as they reported at the First Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Conference 
held last weekend in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dubbed 'Yuppie Flu' 
</P>
<P>
Once dubbed the "yuppie flu" and dismissed as a vogue ailment affecting 
neurotic women, chronic fatigue syndrome is now believed to be a complex 
illness of immune dysfunction that affects people of both sexes and varying 
ages and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Though there is little funding for its study, scientists are hoping to 
understand more about chronic fatigue by scrutinizing viruses, including the 
involvement of the newly discovered Human Herpes Virus 6, or HHV-6, which has 
been linked to cancer and AIDS; questioning whether chronic fatigue is linked 
to multiple sclerosis; puzzling over how it is transmitted, and experimenting 
with treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Even AIDS was simpler than this, because it was caused by one virus, and that 
virus is very new in the last 20 years. It is more likely (with chronic 
fatigue) that a whole bunch of other old viruses and other infectious agents 
are all able to cause some people's bodies to act in a particular way to cause 
this disease," said Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, associate professor of medicine at 
Harvard University and chief of general medicine at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. "It is only since new technology has enabled us to take 
pictures of what goes on in the brain that many physicians became convinced 
this was an illness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Komaroff, a presenter at Saturday's conference attended by about 500 
health-care professionals, said he and other researchers speculate toxins, 
heredity, allergy and stress may work in concert with other factors to trigger 
the malady. 
</P>
<P>
Although statistics documenting its prevalence aren't available, chronic 
fatigue syndrome has been classified as a disease by the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta, which is launching a four-year study. In evaluating 
a grant proposal, the CDC recently noted the illness "appears to be reaching 
epidemic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are more than 200 support groups for patients. The CFIDS 
Chronicle, the journal of the nonprofit Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction 
Syndrome Assn., based in Charlotte, N.C., publishes a bimonthly, 70-page 
journal of advocacy information and research. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, chronic fatigue sufferers talk of callous treatment by the medical 
community. Through the course of her two-year illness, conference speaker 
Melinda Paras, 35, of San Francisco, said she dealt with seven practitioners at 
her health maintenance organization. On one occasion, she said, she was told: " 
'This is a seven-minute appointment. I don't have time to hear your 
complaints.' " 
</P>
<P>
After a battery of laboratory work, Paras was advised to take an AIDS test. As 
terrible as it was to wait two agonizing weeks for the appointment and another 
two weeks for results, it paled by what was to come, she said. "Absolutely the 
worst part of this disease came when I had a particularly acute attack and was 
so weak I couldn't breathe and could hardly move. I was scared. I called the 
HMO, and the nurse-practitioner said: 'There is nothing more we can do for you. 
We recommend you seek psychiatric treatment,' " Paras recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly a program coordinator for a nonprofit institution, Paras was stricken 
while on a business trip in Washington. She thought it was severe flu, but in 
the next two months became so debilitated, "it took me 30 minutes to crawl to 
the bathroom and I had to take a nap on the floor for 30 minutes on the way 
back to bed." 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, Tom Hennessey, a 35-year-old former BMW salesman who described 
himself as "a very aggressive, competitive person," said he is now unable to 
work because of chronic fatigue and has spent his last $20,000 on medical 
expenses. "My life savings and individual retirement account are gone," 
Hennessey said, "and I have sold two cars. I don't have the money to pay the 
May rent." 
</P>

Recently, his claim for Social Security disability was denied, he said. He 
urged health-care workers assembled to support patients with letters and 
documents necessary for disability payments, rent subsidies and food stamps. 
"We also need buddy systems to help us with chores, such as cooking, cleaning 
and taking care of ourselves," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Many are struck in theirs 30s and 40s, experts say, more often women than men. 
Typically, incapacitating exhaustion is accompanied by flu-like symptoms, 
including sore throat, swollen lymph glands, drenching night sweats, chronic 
cough, painful and weak muscles and joints, and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
Some also exhibit multiple sclerosis-like symptoms, such as disorientation, 
memory loss, inability to concentrate, balance disturbances and brain 
inflammation. The disease can last for six months or two years. Others never 
seem to recover. 
</P>
<P>
There is disagreement on how long chronic fatigue syndrome has been around, 
perhaps in different guises. Estimates range from the last 30 years to more 
than 120. In the 20th Century, it has been identified as anemia, a bacterial 
infection, low-blood sugar, environmental allergy, bodywide yeast infection, 
and more recently, Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, which causes infectious 
mononucleosis and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Paul Cheney of the Nalle Clinic in Charlotte, N.C., speculates 
chronic fatigue may be an old disease that has evolved. "If this had been 
around for 200 years, with people this sick, I can't believe we could have 
missed it for so long," he said. "I think it's something that has existed as 
long as viruses, but some new co-factor has been added, as well." 
</P>
<P>
In searching for clues, scientists are trying to understand how viruses work 
singly and together as well as how they affect the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Although HHV-6 and the Epstein-Barr virus don't cause chronic fatigue syndrome, 
they may hold powerful clues, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence of Virus 
</P>
<P>
"We now have evidence that HHV-6 is present and active at the time (chronic 
fatigue patients) are sick," Komaroff reported, citing a collaborative effort 
with Dr. Dharam Ablashi of the National Cancer Institute and Dr. Berch Henry of 
the University of Nevada. The finding may be significant, Komaroff said, 
because an active virus can infect cells of the nervous system, which might 
contribute to some or all symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. At the National 
Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., a high prevalence of antibodies to HHV-6 
also has been found in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
and childhood acute leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hypothesize that, like the AIDS virus, HHV-6 has the ability to 
kill the immune system's helper cells. "In the culture system, we have found 
that when you can co-infect these CD4 helper-positive cells with two viruses, 
the cellular killing effect is much faster than either will do alone," said 
Ablashi, coordinator for DNA virus studies at the National Cancer Institute. In 
a similar vein, investigators speculate that the combination of Epstein-Barr 
and HHV-6 might co-infect the immune system of chronic fatigue patients in a 
devastating manner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still a Puzzle 
</P>
<P>
Just what goes on their immune systems is a puzzle. "It is very difficult to 
sort out the mix of what different agents may be causing this illness. The only 
common denominator for all potential causes or co-factors seems to be the 
element of immunological dysfunction in all these patients," Cheney of the 
Nalle clinic said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney became interested in the disease while practicing medicine in the early 
1980s. At the time, he was inundated with patients from Lake Tahoe suffering 
from what he thought might be a chronic mononucleosis-type illness. 
</P>
<P>
After years of research, he believes "the immunologic problem isn't necessarily 
a severe one like AIDS. It looks as much like an allergy. Rather than being 
suppressed, the immune system looks like it is hyper-responsive, really 
fighting something." Theoretically, he added, the immune system's raging battle 
may be one reason chronic fatigue patients feel ill constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Virologist Dr. Jay Levy and his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Group at UC 
San Francisco have been unsuccessful in attempts to isolate an agent that might 
cause chronic fatigue. Perplexed by patients whose symptoms resemble multiple 
sclerosis, he poses these unanswered questions: "Are these really MS patients, 
or is this an early sign of multiple sclerosis in some people? Could chronic 
fatigue syndrome be an acute symptom of another virus that gives rise to 
multiple sclerosis in certain people?" 
</P>
<P>
Another researcher, Dr. David Bell of Lyndonville, N.Y., started seeing 
children with what he now believes is chronic fatigue syndrome in 1983. "These 
children had large lymph nodes, big spleens and were quite sick. They still are 
sick today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genetic or Infectious? 
</P>
<P>
After identifying 21 cases at a local school, the pediatrician compared the 
youngsters with a group of 42 healthy children, examining about 50 factors. 
Among his findings: "The people who got sick had a high rate of allergy, 
implying a genetic marker. There was a high rate of people within the same 
family becoming ill, implying an infectious agent. And people with the illness 
were much more likely to have been drinking raw milk." After three years of 
research, however, the pediatrician has been unable to explain what role raw 
milk might play. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who is affiliated with the Roswell Park Memorial Institute, a cancer 
research center in Buffalo, N.Y., reflects a common complaint about lack of 
research grants. "When you see a disease that is so devastating to the lives of 
children and families, it is remarkable that so little has been done about 
this. I see children who haven't been out of bed in a year, and yet there is 
very little government response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also of concern to doctors is the impact the illness appears to have on the 
brain. Cheney said brain tests in some patients reveal unexplained white 
lesions of the cortex -- the brain's outer layer of gray matter -- and 
abnormalities in the temporal lobes where vision, hearing, memory and emotion 
are processed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our scans, mapping electrical activity, show there are characteristics of 
brain lesions in almost all of the people who have chronic fatigue syndrome," 
added Goldstein of Anaheim Hills. "In some patients, we see areas of decreased 
blood flow in certain areas of the brain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cognitive Problems 
</P>
<P>
These changes correspond with cognitive impairment. "I have seen IQ tests drop 
30 points. I have a doctor in my practice who can't drive a car because he 
can't read street signs and mothers who don't remember the names of their 
daughters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He theorizes that an unknown virus enters cells of the immune system of a 
genetically susceptible person, inducing production of a chemical transmitter 
or cytokine. Other cells, in turn, make their own transmitter chemicals. "You 
can almost view the immune system and the brain as one organ. The body is a 
network of these communicating systems," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
He speculates that by treating the brain, the immune system can be altered. 
Experimenting with a drug that increases slow-wave sleep, he plans to study "in 
what ways this treatment might make people feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Other clinicians are also searching for treatments. In some of her patients, 
Bay Area physician Dr. Carol Jessop has found an imbalance of gastrointestinal 
bacteria and yeast caused, she believes, by chronic use of antibiotics, a 
high-sugar diet, birth control pills, steroids, or, in some people, an 
immunosuppression caused by an unknown viral agent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, patient advocacy groups are becoming increasingly vocal. Jan 
Montgomery of San Francisco's Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
Foundation was instrumental in urging city officials to form a task force 
resulting in the conference, co-sponsored by the San Francisco Medical Society, 
the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the UC San Francisco 
Department of Medicine and School of Nursing. 
</P>
<P>
And researchers, too, are coming to the defense of chronic fatigue patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe, personally, these are people who are primarily depressed or 
psychologically ill," said Dr. Leonard S. Zegans, professor of psychiatry and 
director of professional education at the Langley Porter Institute, a UC 
psychiatric research, teaching and treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
The disease represents powerful stress, the psychiatrist said. Moreover, 
symptoms such as impaired attention and anxiety alter performance at work or 
school, "calling self-worth and self-esteem into question." Not being able to 
work is especially devastating because "many of these people are ambitious," 
Zegans added. Patients become isolated, in part, because "not everyone believes 
they are sick." 
</P>
<P>
He, too, suspects a virus, latent in the blood stream, maybe re-activated by a 
variety of causes, including stress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just now beginning to learn about the interaction between the nervous 
system and the immune system," he told his colleagues at the conference. "We 
have a very complex system of checks and balances in the body and there perhaps 
are ways in which the equilibrium of body defenses can be altered. I think in 
the next 20 years, we are going to be learning a tremendous amount about this."

   A Yale graduate charged with four
murders was a brilliant student and a star athlete, but was
frustrated entering the working world by a lingering, poorly
understood illness, neighbors and friends said.
   A judge on Tuesday set a $4 million bail for Rolando Marcello,
who was formally charged with four counts of first-degree murder
for a Memorial Day rampage that left his mother, brother, a family
friend and a neighbor dead.
   ``What would make a young boy, a promising kid, just snap like
this?'' asked Superior Court Judge Mariam Span. ``We don't know.
That fatal moment he just lost all control. This was not a
malicious boy.''
   Span did not order a psychiatric evaluation.
   Marcello, who was being held in the Union County jail, was
carried, manacled and dressed in jail khakis, into the court.
   Police said they found no indication of drug or alcohol use in a
search of Marcello's house. They recovered what they said was the
murder weapon, a 10-inch butcher knife.
   As a straight-A student at Oratory Preparatory School, where he
graduated in 1983, Marcello was named Union County Scholar-Athlete
of the Year, served as editor of the school newspaper, was captain
of the Chess Team and president of the National Honor Society.
   ``He was everything you wanted to see in a young man,'' said the
Rev. Floyd Rotunno, Oratory's headmaster. ``He was academically
gifted, but he was really well-rounded in everything. I never even
saw him angry.''
   Steve Galluzzo and Ted Sanders, who live in the tree-lined,
upper-middle class Springbrook Park neighborhood with Marcello,
said that Anita Marcello told them six months ago that her
23-year-old son was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which
also has been called Epstein-Barr Syndrome.
   The syndrome has the nickname ``yuppie flu'' because it tends to
strike high-achieving, hard-driving people in their 30s. But Dr.
Thomas Lane, director of the University of Connecticut Fatigue
Clinic, called the label ``purely a media misnomer.''
   He said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has cited the
syndrome as a new illness that can also occur in the poor and
elderly.
   ``I have difficulty connecting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as it
is now defined, to homicide,'' said Lane. But he said the syndrome
can cause depression.
   ``Suicide is certainly common,'' he said.
   The symptoms include long-term fatigue, possibly caused by the
Epstein-Barr virus, which causes a form of mononucleosis. Some
medical researchers are looking into mental illness as a cause for
the syndrome.
   ``His mother talked about this syndrome thing because people
were asking about Rolly, when was he going back to work and all
that,'' Sanders said. ``It didn't seem like anything was wrong with
him, he was just a normal kid, and a brain. He just went ape,
that's all.''
   The other victims were Marcello's 20-year-old brother, Raymond;
family friend Nelson Paiva, 20; and neighbor Mark Dennis, 36.
Neighbor Richard Hartmann was in stable condition Tuesday with stab
wounds to the chest.
   After graduating from Yale in 1987, Marcello worked a short time
as an intern with Chemical Bank in New York before mononucleosis
forced him to drop out in February 1988, neighbors said.

   Researchers have developed a blood test
to distinguish sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome - or ``yuppie
flu'' - from those feeling run-down for other reasons, a scientist
says.
   The test checks levels of white blood cells, AIDS researcher Jay
Levy said Sunday at a national conference on the chronic fatigue
syndrome. He led the group that developed the test at the
University of California at San Francisco.
   Levy said most of the 120 chronic fatigue patients tested at the
university had abnormal levels of three types of white blood cells
produced when the body fights a virus.
   No one virus was present in all the patients, but Levy said
levels of those three cells were either consistently high or
consistently low in most of the patients.
   Therefore, he said, a check of those white blood cells, plus a
review of the patient's medical history, could determine whether a
person has chronic fatigue syndrome. None of the 80 healthy people
studied had abnormal levels, Levy said.
   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by exhaustion, joint
and muscle aches, fever and other problems that persist for more
than six months and often for years. Its cause is unknown.
   Tens of thousands of Americans believe they have chronic fatigue
syndrome, although the extent of it is unclear. It was dubbed
``yuppie flu'' because it has been widely reported among
well-educated women in their 30s and 40s.
   The weekend conference, titled ``Unraveling the Mystery,'' drew
400 eople, including researchers and people afflicted with the
ailment.
   Most researchers now agree the illness stems from immune system
abnormalities, not depression or other psychological factors, Levy
said.
   He called it ``the disease of the '90s.''
   ``This is going to be the 10 years that we see the greatest
advancement in understanding this disease,'' he said.
   He suggested the name be changed to ``chronic immune activation
syndrome'' because research indicates that patients' immune systems
are chronically ``activated,'' as if fighting a continuing viral
infection.
   With most viral infections, such as the flu, the immune system
fights vigorously, causing fatigue and muscle aches. But it quiets
down when the virus is killed. In chronic fatigue syndrome, the
immune system stays on the attack, causing the symptoms to persist,
he said.
   Besides trying to determine the cause, researchers are
struggling to learn how the illness is transmitted and whether it
is contagious.
   Dr. Walter Gunn, a researcher with the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, said an inter-agency committee had been formed
to determine the extent of the illness.

Depression may be the primary cause of debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome, 
the so-called "yuppie flu," and not a common virus, scientists reported last 
week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>

University of Washington researchers said comparisons of 26 people who suffered 
from chronic fatigue and 18 others with no medical complaints turned up no 
evidence the syndrome is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as some past 
studies had suggested. 
</P>
<P>
EBV, which causes mononucleosis, had been suspected of causing chronic fatigue 
because many victims of the disease showed signs of being infected with it.

The primary symptom is long-term lethargy that leaves victims unable to 
function normally and often, unable to work.

chronic fatigue sufferers had experienced at least one episode of major 
depression before the onset of their illnesses.

   A growing body of evidence suggests that a virus or some
other physiological agent -- and not psychiatric troubles --
is a cause of the mysterious ailment known as chronic fatigue
syndrome.
   Researchers who met this weekend in Atlanta said one of at
least four different viruses could be a cause of the
syndrome. None has yet emerged as a leading prospect and
there is no assurance that any of them will be shown to cause
the illness. But the number of candidates itself is viewed as
bolstering the case that some identifiable agent underlies
the illness.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, a study published Saturday in Lancet, a British
medical journal, found that many chronic fatigue patients,
particularly those with severe symptoms, suffer from immune
system irregularities that could provoke many characteristics
of the illness. And an official at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta said data collected in the
agency's study of chronic fatigue are consistent with a
physical cause for the ailment.
   The syndrome is marked by severe fatigue, muscle and joint
pain, and often by cognitive and neurological impairments
such as loss of balance and trouble adding and subtracting.
Such symptoms resemble those of many other illnesses and they
vary widely from patient to patient, making diagnosis
difficult. Some scientists and physicians believe an
infectious agent such as a virus causes the illness, but many
others think psychological or other yet-to-be identified
problems cause the symptoms.
   Finding a physical cause would be a major breakthrough for
efforts to improve diagnosis, develop treatments and
determine whether the syndrome is contagious and how it might
spread. It would also give both patients and researchers more
credibilty in the medical community, where chronic fatigue
continues to face high levels of skepticism. "One of the
major problems with this disease is having it believed," says
Jay A. Levy, a researcher at University of California at San
Fransisco and principal investigator for the research just
published in Lancet.
   But the recent developments also underscore the enormous
complexity that surrounds chronic fatigue and the hurdles
ahead for people who have it and for researchers. "All of us
would like this to be a simpler story than it's going to turn
out to be," says Anthony Komaroff, chief of general medicine
at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, and chairman of the
National Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Council. That
panel met Saturday at the CDC to discuss research on the
ailment.
   Leading investigators and the viruses they are focusing on
include: Elaine DeFreitas of the Wistar Institute in
Philadelphia, who is looking at an unidentified retrovirus
similar to one known as HTLV-2; John Martin of the University
of Southern California, Los Angeles, who is focusing on a
spumavirus, a retrovirus known as human foamy virus; Peter
Behan of the University of Glasgow, Scotland, who is studying
enteroviruses that include the polio virus; and Dr. Komaroff
at Harvard University, who thinks the human herpes virus
might be responsible.
   Such viruses already reside in most people but are held at
bay by the immune system. But research by Drs. Levy and Nancy
Klimas, an immunologist at the University of Miami School of
Medicine, shows that chronic fatigue sufferers have abnormal
immune systems that may fail to clear the body of invading
viruses or to prevent reactivation of latent ones. That
raises the question of whether they are a cause or effect of
chronic fatigue, Dr. Klimas said.
   In the Lancet article, Dr. Levy and his colleagues
reported that patients with severe chronic fatigue symptoms
have abnormalities in a group of infection-fighting cells
known as CD8 cells. The patients had increased numbers of CD8
cells that launch an attack on an invader, but lower than
normal amounts of CD8 suppressor cells that damp the immune
system after the system's job is done. The result is a
hyperactive immune system that pours uncontrolled amounts of
agents called cytokines into the body, apparently provoking
fatigue, muscle pain and other symptoms. The research
compared 147 people with chronic fatigue and 145 without.
   In blood tests, Dr. Levy found no correlation between any
of several viruses and chronic fatigue. One question Dr. Levy
is investigating is whether an unidentified virus is involved
in killing the suppressor cells that would moderate the
action of the immune system.
   Meanwhile, Walter Gunn, principal investigator for the
CDC's chronic fatigue research, says about 42% of 525 people
with symptoms referred to his agency by U.S. physicians
approximated CDC criteria for the illness. Among them, 30%
had evidence of depression near the onset of symptoms; half
had no history of depression. "These data don't compel one to
think this is a psychiatric illness," he says.
   His agency is trying to replicate findings of Dr.
DeFreitas at Wistar and others in a study of Georgia patients
with chronic fatigue in an effort to find a physical marker
that in a blood or other test would clearly identify those
with the illness, thus aiding diagnosis.

<HEAD>Depression, Anxiety May Cause More Chronic Fatigue Than Disease,
Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chronic fatigue can be as disabling as a heart
attack, but it may stem more from depression and anxiety than from
any physical cause, a new study indicates.
   In a report in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Kurt Kroenke, assistant chief of medicine at
Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, said many
doctors don't take chronic fatigue seriously enough.
   Such fatigue, which he compared to lower back pain, can result
in impairment in day-to-day activities resembling that in people
recovering from a heart attack or suffering from other serious
diseases.
   ``Fatigue tends to be underestimated many times in the
physician's mind as a minor complaint,'' Kroenke said Thursday.
``Fatigue is a symptom that doesn't affect the patients' lifespan,
but it causes a lot of disability.''
   Kroenke and his colleagues said 24 percent of 1,159 adults who
answered questionnaires at base clinics in 1986 identified fatigue
as a major problem.
   He and his colleagues conducted further studies on 102 people
who complained of fatigue lasting at least 30 days but had no
identifiable illnesses.
   Fifty-seven of them showed evidence of depression on
psychosocial and physical tests, while 58 of them had scores
suggesting abnormal levels of anxiety, and a total of 82 people _
80 percent of the group _ had one or both.
   In a comparison group of 26 people who had suffered no chronic
fatigue, only three people, or 12 percent, showed abnormal levels
of anxiety or depression, the researchers reported.
   They said a cause-and-effect relationship doesn't necessarily
exist between fatigue and anxiety or depression, because fatigue
could result from an unrecognized illness. But the ``consistent and
powerful findings'' on psychological tests, combined with an
absence of significant differences in lab tests between fatigued
and non-fatigued groups, ``indicate that emotional factors play a
role in chronic fatigue,'' they said.
   Therapy for fatigue sufferers could include reassurance,
counseling, psychoactive drugs and exercise, they said.
   The study did not explore the possible connection between
tiredness and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes
mononucleosis and has been suspected as a cause of chronic fatigue.
   But another study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association found a test for Epstein-Barr virus ``not helpful'' in
determining the cause of chronic tiredness, said authors led by Dr.
Walter Hellinger of the Mayo Clinic's facility in Jacksonville, Fla.
   They found no significant differences between 30 fatigued
patients who tested high for levels of a substance indicating the
presence of Epstein-Barr virus and 30 fatigued subjects who the
test revealed had low levels of the same substance.
   One co-author, Dr. Robert Van Scoy of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., noted the study did not deal with all tests for
Epstein-Barr, but just with the test for the early antigen, or
indicator, of the virus.
   Other researchers had reported in 1985 they found the
early-antigen test ``very useful'' in establishing the link between
the virus and chronic fatigue.

   A blood test has been devised to help
doctors diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome, a flu-like illness some
have dubbed ``yuppie flu,'' a scientist said Sunday.
   Dr. Jay Levy of San Francisco announced the development at a
national conference on the disease here. He predicted the
mysterious illness will be the ``disease of the '90s'' as the
public and the medical community become more aware of it.
   ``It takes about decade before the public wakes up and realizes
that this is not going to go away,'' Levy said.
   The weekend conference, titled ``Unraveling the Mystery,'' drew
400 people including researchers and people afflicted with the
ailment.
   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by fatigue,
exhaustion, joint and muscle aches, and an array of other problems
that persist for more than six months, and often for years.
   Tens of thousands of Americans believe they have chronic fatigue
syndrome, although the extent of it is uncertain. Some researchers
believe the disease may be centuries old and it's just been
misdiagnosed all this time.
   Because it has been widely reported among well-educated women in
their 30s and 40s, the syndrome was dubbed ``yuppie flu.''
   An effort to discover how widespread it is, an inter-agency
coordinating commmittee has been formed, said Dr. Walter Gunn, a
chronic fatigue syndrome researcher at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   Levy, an AIDS researcher at the University of California at San
Francisco, led a group that developed a blood test for the disease.
   Levy said his team was unable to find one virus that caused the
illness. Some research has linked the syndrome to a retrovirus, one
of the family of viruses that causes AIDS.
   ``Because of the immune profile of these patients, we believe
there has been an infection by some agent, though this agent may no
longer be in the body,'' Levy said. ``Or it may be hidden. It
cannot as yet be identified.''
   In any case, he said, the immune system of chronic fatigue
patients is activated for months or years, creating high levels of
a particular white blood cell, caled the CD8&plus; cytotoxic T cell.
   The persistence of the white blood cell causes symptoms of a
viral infection, Levy said.
   The CD8&plus; cytotoxic cells appear to be the major cell type
activated in the disease - a signature unique to chronic fatigue
syndrome, Levy said. So the blood test checks for high levels of
those cells.
   ``This is a way to distinguish those with fatigue alone from
those with an immune reaction that causes chronic fatigue,'' he
said.
   Levy said the level of the white blood cells along with an
examination of the patient's medical history could determine
whether a patient is suffering from the syndrome.
   Levy and other researchers suggested the syndrome be renamed
``chronic immune activation syndrome'' to reflect their findings.

<HEAD>Positive Attitude, Exercise May Slow Immune System Destruction</HEAD>

   Positive thinking, exercise, support from
friends and other ways of reducing stress may help AIDS victims slow
the disease's progression, researchers said.
   But some AIDS researchers at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science cast doubt on the theory.
   ``The jury is still out,'' said Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a clinical
psychologist at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.
   ``We encourage people (infected with the AIDS virus) to do things
that may be helpful and certainly can't be harmful,'' such as
exercising, getting adequate sleep and nutrition and avoiding drugs
and alcohol, said Dr. Karl Goodkin, a psychiatrist at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
   But he said Sunday undue optimism that a positive outlook might
slow progression of AIDS could spur people infected by acquired
immune deficiency syndrome to blame themselves wrongly when their
condition worsens.
   Within the last decade, studies have shown stress can affect the
development and course of upper respiratory infections,
mononucleosis, herpes simplex, rheumatoid arthritis and skin, breast
and cervical cancer.
   In that light, Dr. Ronald Glaser, chairman of immunology at the
Ohio State medical college, said it's not surprising to theorize
that psychological factors may play a role in the progression of
symptom-free AIDS infection to AIDS-related complex to fully
developed AIDS.
   Blood and psychological tests on 18 AIDS patients found that
those who exercised, were assertive and had lower levels of tension,
depression, fatigue, stress and anger also tended to have higher
numbers of disease-fighting immune system cells, according to a
study by Lydia Temoshok, a psychologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and George Solomon, a UCLA psychiatry
professor.
   AIDS cripples the immune system, leaving people susceptible to
fatal infections and cancer.
   University of Miami psychologist Michael Antoni measured various
signs of psychological and immune system functioning among 39
symptom-free homosexual males at various times before and after
tests revealed if they were infected by the AIDS virus. Some of the
men had been participating in a 10-week aerobic exercise program
while others had not.
   Among those who turned out to be AIDS-infected, the exercisers
had higher levels of certain immune system white blood cells. Men
who were better at venting their emotions and seeking social support
also had better signs of immune system performance, Antoni said.
   And compared with non-exercisers, the exercise group suffered
less depression, anxiety, confusion and bewilderment after learning
they were infected.
   Goodkin studied 40 homosexual men _ 13 who were healthy, 10 who
were AIDS-infected but symptom-free, four who had AIDS-related
complex and 13 who suffered fully developed AIDS.
   ``The results showed that those who had the virus but had not
progressed to AIDS had less stress in their lives, more social
support and had a more confident coping style that either the
non-infected group or the group that had progressed to AIDS or
ARC,'' the University of Texas said in a news release.
   Goodkin said his findings suggest AIDS-infected people might
benefit from exercise, relaxation training, participation in support
groups, and psychotherapy that emphasizes positive thinking to
reduce anxiety and depression.
   ``It may even help to get infected patients to deny to some
extent the idea of their eventual disability and death,'' he said.
   Many follow that philosophy. Every week, about 800 Los
Angeles-area people infected with AIDS have crowded into seminars
conducted by controversial AIDS counselor Louise Hay, who preaches
that ``love is the most powerful stimulant to the immune system.''

   A University of Southern California researcher says he has
identified a virus that may cause or play another important
role in a mysterious ailment known as chronic fatigue
syndrome.
   John Martin, chief of molecular pathology at USC Medical
Center, Los Angeles, says he found the virus in the cerebral
spinal fluid of about 10 patients with severe neurological
abnormalities that mimic problems associated with brain
ailments such as multiple sclerosis. Many people afflicted
with chronic fatigue syndrome suffer some unexplained
neurological problems. The virus, from a family known as
spumaviruses, hadn't been previously linked to human disease.

<TEXT>
   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe
fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and often by such
neurological symptoms as loss of balance and coordination and
difficulty in arithmetic and in recalling words and phrases.
It isn't known how many people suffer from the affliction.
But individual symptoms vary widely and are similar to those
of many other illnesses, making specific diagnosis difficult.
   Some doctors and scientists have long been convinced that
some infectious agent underlies the syndrome, but others
think that while symptoms are real, patients suffer them as a
result of psychological problems, or some other yet-to-be
discovered cause. The disease has been derided as "yuppie
flu," because it appeared to strike well-educated men and,
especially, women, in their 30s.
   Disputes over diagnosis are also reflected in medical
research, where just looking for a cause of the ailment is
extraordinarily controversial. Indeed, Dr. Martin
acknowledges that three prominent medical journals have
declined to publish his current data, even as a letter to the
editor. The data haven't yet been replicated by other
researchers.
   Dr. Martin presented his findings at a recent meeting of
chronic fatigue researchers in San Francisco. He will discuss
them again next weekend with other scientists -- some of whom
previously reported evidence of a viral cause of the syndrome
-- at a meeting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta. One possible topic of discussion at the next meeting
is whether researchers who appear to be considering different
viruses as a possible cause of the syndrome may actually be
looking at the same one.
   "It's too early to say {a spumavirus} is a cause of
chronic fatigue syndrome," says Dr. Paul Cheney, a Charlotte,
N.C., doctor who treats chronic fatigue patients and is
familiar with Dr. Martin's work. But when considered in the
context of other recent research, he says, "it's a very
appealing {candidate} as a cause."
   But other scientists say that even if Dr. Martin's
findings are replicated, it isn't clear that his seriously
ill patients suffer from the syndrome as opposed to an
atypical neurologic disease. Dr. Martin says he also found
evidence of the virus in about half of 300 patients diagnosed
with chronic fatigue syndrome -- some of whose symptoms
aren't so serious. But he adds that he isn't ready to say
definitely that all of those patients are infected with a
spumavirus. In any event, finding a new viral cause of any
human illness would have important public health
implications.
   Many scientists investigating the syndrome say they are
now convinced that it reflects the immune system's response
to an invading infectious agent, possibly a virus. They
suspect that the agent engages the immune system and keeps it
from shutting down, with the resulting biological activity
consuming the body's energy at the molecular and cellular
level. So far, experimental efforts to treat the disease have
focused on regulating the immune system, and results of a
trial of a drug called Ampligen, which is believed to
modulate the immune system, are expected to be announced next
month.
   If researchers can pinpoint a viral cause of the syndrome,
Dr. Martin says, efforts would be launched to find an
anti-viral treatment. Such a finding would also provide a
definitive means of diagnosing the disease, thus perhaps
avoiding costly regimens of ineffective tests and treatments.
   Dr. Martin said in an interview that the 10 seriously ill
people he tested were referred to him by such specialists as
psychiatrists, neurologists and rheumatoidologists. They had
been suspected of having such diseases as multiple sclerosis,
lupus and encephalitis, but their symptoms didn't clearly fit
the classic definition of any of them. "They get all types of
tests and therapies and they won't get better. These are very
sad stories of people groping for some kind of a diagnosis
from a specialist," Dr. Martin says.
   One reason other scientists may question whether his first
10 patients are legitimate chronic fatigue patients, he
asserts, is that chronic fatigue patients aren't usually
thought to be so sick. "It's not a trivial illness," he says.
"We are dealing with something much more serious and complex
than the name implies."
   Dr. Martin prefers a diagnosis such as myelagic
encephalopathy, denoting disease of the brain and spinal
column, for such patients, a description that focuses on the
illness's impact on the brain rather than the immune system.
   He says the spumavirus was grown in culture in his
laboratory using cerebral spinal fluid extracted from the
seriously ill patients.
   From an additional 300 patients, mostly referrals from
three doctors, including Dr. Cheney, who regularly treat
chronic fatigue, the same test turned up positive in 160
cases. A thorough analysis of those patients, Dr. Martin
says, hasn't been completed.
   Dr. Cheney, who recently visited Dr. Martin's lab, says
his referrals included patients with mild, moderate and
severe symptoms and that there wasn't any correlation between
those who tested positive for the virus and how sick they
were.
   He says one question is whether the culture test used is
sensitive enough to find the virus in all cases. If it is,
then a roughly 50% positive rate would indicate the virus is
associated, but not necessarily a cause of chronic fatigue.
If a more sensitive test turns up a much higher positive
rate, say 85% or more, it would suggest a spumavirus as a
cause.
   Dr. Cheney says one factor pointing to causation is a
study published recently in the magazine Science by a German
research team that injected mice with human spumavirus. Among
their findings, he says, was that the mice developed a loss
of balance and coordination similar to that experienced by
chronic fatigue patients.
   Spumaviruses are one of a class of agents called
retroviruses. Other retroviruses include human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS.

<TEXT>
   Droopy-eyed and weak, millions of
people visit their doctors every year with a common complaint: They
are tired.
   Doctors at the University of Connecticut Health Center have
discovered that relatively little study has focused on chronic
fatigue, despite interest in the so-called ``yuppie disease,''
chronic fatigue syndrome.
   They decided to help bridge the research gap by establishing a
clinic for patients whose major complaint is chronic fatigue.
   After seeing more than 300 patients over the past three years,
the doctors believe many of the chronically fatigued are suffering
from depression, not chronic fatigue, and can be treated with
anti-depressants and therapy.
   ``There is a great tragedy of saying that chronic fatigue is
viral without a shred of evidence,'' said Dr. Thomas Lane, the
clinic's director. ``Depression and panic disorder are easily
treatable.''
   Contrary to the beliefs of many of their patients, the doctors
believe that few of their clients at the clinic are suffering from
chronic fatigue syndrome.
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta defined the syndrome
as an illness just last year. The CDC says its victims have other
symptoms besides unending tiredness, including headache, sore
throat, fever, weakness, lymph node pain, muscle and joint pains,
memory loss and difficulty concentrating.
   Both the cause and the cure for the syndrome are unknown, but
many doctors believe the root is viral. Several studies have
attempted to link chronic fatigue to the Epstein-Barr virus, which
is related to herpes.
   The mystery surrounding persistent fatigue prompted a fateful
discussion between Lane and his colleagues, Dr. Dale Matthews and
Dr. Peter Manu in 1985.
   ``We compared notes and thought it might be one patient in 10
whose main complaint was chronic fatigue, so we went to the
literature and found it was the fourth most common complaint for
seeing a doctor,'' said Lane, the fatigue clinic's director.
   Fatigue accounts for 10.5 million visits to U.S. doctors each
year, he said.
   ``Research so far has been minimal and even that has been
descriptive,'' Lane said. ``Doctors simply describe the people
they've treated.''
   In November 1986, Lane and his colleagues began asking patients
plagued by fatigue to come to a special clinic. They treated adults
who have not been hospitalized in the past three months and whose
primary complaint is feeling tired at least half the time for at
least the past month.
   Most of the clinic's patients are between 20 and 30 years old.
Women outnumber men two to one. Many come to the clinic convinced
they have chronic fatigue syndrome.
   The physicians complete a medical history of their patients,
give them a physical examination and comprehensive blood tests. The
physicians check for the textbook causes of fatigue: thyroid
problems, viral infections and low blood sugar.
   Patients also must complete a 260-item questionnaire recognized
by the National Institute of Mental Health as an accurate test for
psychiatric diagnoses. Special tests, like sleep studies, are
ordered as needed, Lane said.
   The clinic's findings on 135 patients, published in 1988, showed
that the major causes of fatigue for 67 percent of the patients
were active psychiatric disorders. For 3 percent, medical disorders
were the major causes. Only 6 percent of patients met the CDC
definition of chronic fatigue.
   The major cause of fatigue in the remaining patients was unclear.
   The clinic's findings have gained recognition _ including
publication in prominent medical journals _ and criticism from some
chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers who question the link between
chronic fatigue and depression.
   He prescribes drugs and psychotherapy for patients who are
depressed or suffer panic disorders.
   Jane Packer, 36, of Thomaston said she regained her energy after
accepting Lane's prescriptions.
   Before she saw Lane, she would wake up in the morning and feel
as though she had not slept the night before. She became so
melancholy, she said she would ``cry at the drop of the hat.''
   After tests failed to tell her what was wrong, she wanted to
believe she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.
   ``It's not easy to admit that you're depressed. There's a
stigma,'' she said. ``I think some people with chronic fatigue may
have something (viral) wrong with them, but I think most people are
like me.''

   Researchers said a clinical trial showed that a
controversial experimental drug called Ampligen significantly
improved symptoms of people suffering from severe chronic
fatigue syndrome.
   The study of 92 patients is the first major trial of any
drug for the mysterious ailment and the results yield fresh
evidence that it may be caused by some viral infection and
immune system irregularities. Researchers said that magnetic
resonance imaging exams showed that about half the people in
the study had unexplained brain abnormalities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study was conducted by Hem Pharmaceuticals Corp.,
which is developing Ampligen. While the drug appeared to be
effective for some people, it doesn't cure the ailment. And
it isn't clear what portion of those diagnosed with chronic
fatigue may benefit from Ampligen or how long they would have
to be treated.
   "You can't really judge yet whether it will prove to be a
feasible therapy," says Anthony Komaroff, a Harvard Medical
School researcher who is familiar with the findings. "It's
only a partial report. But it surely looks promising."
   A spokesman at the Food and Drug Administration said the
data are "very preliminary" and that "it's too early to claim
that Ampligen is a dramatic treatment for chronic fatigue
syndrome." The spokesman added that "the product has
significant side effects that would have to be considered
against any claimed benefits." The agency is constrained by
law from commenting more specifically, the spokesman said.
   People familiar with the process say Hem filed an
application with the FDA on Sept. 3 to try the drug on a
limited number of additional people under a policy aimed at
broadening access to promising experimental medicines for
serious diseases before they are approved for marketing. The
agency has 30 days to respond to the application, known as a
Treatment IND, and a decision is expected by later this week.
   A favorable decision isn't assured, but it would be a
boost for Hem, a fledgling, closely held company based in
Philadelphia that has struggled with credibility problems in
an effort to prove that Ampligen is an effective treatment
for a variety of illnesses, including AIDS and some cancers.
In any event, any decision on whether to permit broad
marketing of Ampligen is several months or years away.
   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe,
prolonged fatigue, muscle and joint pain and by neurological
problems. Symptoms mimic other diseases, making diagnosis
difficult, and many doctors believe it results from
psychiatric troubles. Severity varies; some patients continue
working while others are completely bedridden.
   It isn't known how many people are afflicted, but the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which is conducting a
study to determine its prevalence, says it gets up to 3,000
calls a month from people who think they have the illness.
The Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome
Association Inc., a patient organization based in Charlotte,
N.C., says it received 40,000 inquiries last summer alone.
   Patients in the study were severely stricken with the
ailment for at least three years and all required assistance
for such routine activities as getting dressed, going to the
bathroom and balancing a checkbook. All were being treated by
one of four doctors who specialize in chronic fatigue
syndrome with practices in Charlotte and in Incline Village,
Nev., Portland, Ore., and Houston, and who are among
co-authors of the study.
   Researchers said 45 of the patients received twice-weekly
infusions of Ampligen while 47 got a saltwater placebo.
Neither doctors nor patients knew who was getting the drug.
Some patients experienced flu-like reactions early in the
study, but the incidence of such "adverse events" wasn't
statistically different between the drug and placebo groups,
according to William Carter, principal investigator and a
co-inventor of the drug. He said he knew of no instances
where a dose was reduced or treatment was stopped due to side
effects. Dr. Carter presented results of the study at a
meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Chicago.
   Dr. Carter, who is also president and a shareholder of
Hem, said the study found that by two separate scoring
systems, patients treated 24 weeks with Ampligen increased
their daily living activity levels on average by about 20%,
compared with little or no increase for those on placebo.
Ampligen patients on average showed increased endurance on
treadmill tests by the 24th week while the performance of
those on placebo declined. Seven Ampligen patients were
hospitalized for their symptoms during the course of the
study for a total of 19 days, Dr. Carter said, while seven
placebo patients spent a total of 114 days in the hospital.
   The patients "advanced progressively in daily living
activities," Dr. Carter said. "They thought better, were less
forgetful and had fewer headaches than patients in the
placebo group." While many Ampligen patients continued to
have symptoms after 24 weeks, most could carry on their lives
with more independence, he added.
   Dr. Carter said three factors were associated with
patients who responded particularly well to Ampligen: an
acute flu-like onset of the illness; elevated levels of
interleukin-1, an infection-fighting agent of the immune
system, at the beginning of the study; and presence on an MRI
exam of unidentified white spots in front portions of the
brain associated with memory and certain intellectual
activities.
   Scientists believe the drug works by regulating an immune
system pathway that in normal people becomes activated when
the body senses it is being invaded by a virus. Elevated
interleukin-1 levels are one indication that in chronic
fatigue patients, the pathway is overactive. Researchers also
believe that Ampligen blocks virus production.
   At the end of the study, interleukin-1 levels had
diminished in patients who responded to the drug, Dr. Carter
said, an indication that the viral pathway activity was
reduced. It isn't yet known whether the white spots, which
have been reported in chronic fatigue patients by other
researchers, healed after Ampligen treatment, he said.
   Whether or not the drug ultimately is useful in treating
chronic fatigue, the study's findings refute arguments that
its symptoms are provoked by psychological problems, says
Harvard's Dr. Komaroff, who is a member of Hem's scientific
advisory board, but who hasn't any financial stake in the
company. "This isn't a medicine that acts on the psyche," he
says. "It acts on the body."

<HEAD>Mouse With Human Immune System Called A New Tool Against AIDS,

   Researchers say they created a ``human
mouse'' by transplanting the human immune system into rodents,
providing a powerful new tool to study and combat AIDS, cancer,
herpes and many other human diseases.
   In separate studies, the scientists said they used human blood
cells or tissue from aborted human fetuses to develop mice that
produced human antibodies and T cells, the class of white blood
cells attacked by the AIDS virus as it cripples patients' immunity.
   With human immune systems, the mice should make excellent
stand-ins for people, allowing researchers to more rapidly develop
and test new drugs and vaccines against a variety of diseases, said
the scientists from Stanford University and the La Jolla-based
Medical Biology Institute.
   ``We've developed a system in which we can study human cells
directly in a small laboratory animal,'' Dr. Mike McCune, chief
author of the Stanford study, said Wednesday.
   McCune and co-author Dr. Irving Weissman also said such mice
could lead to development of better methods to transplant organs,
and reduce researchers' need to use dwindling populations of
chimpanzees for studies of human ailments.
   ``I consider it a major accomplishment,'' especially in the
fight against AIDS, said Daniel Koshland Jr., editor f the journal
Science, which will publish the Stanford study Sept. 23.
   The British journal Nature today published the other study,
conducted by Dr. Donald Mosier and others at the Medical Biology
Institute and the Veterans Administration in La Jolla.
   Dr. David Katz, the institute's president, said the researchers
succeeded in ``making a human mouse.''
   ``It is not human in the real sense because the mouse is walking
around and behaving like a mouse, only it is protected by a human
immune system,'' Katz said during a telephone interview.
   Mice and other animals normally serve as only approximate models
or stand-ins for people when researchers infect them with human
diseases and test possible new drugs and vaccines on them. Such
studies often are difficult or impossible to perform on humans for
various ethical and practical reasons.
   The deadly AIDS virus cripples the immune system, leaving
patients vulnerable to death from various infections and cancers.
But the virus doesn't infect normal mice and behaves differently in
chimps and monkeys than in people.
   However, mice with human immune systems should suffer the same
kind of AIDS symptoms as humans, making them extremely valuable for
testing possible new drugs and vaccine, the researchers said.
   Katz said Mosier's team injected mice with peripheral blood
leukocytes _ a type of white blood cell _ to successfully
reconstitute a fully functioning human immune system in mice
suffering severe combined immune deficiency, an inherited absence
of immunity.
   Such mice normally would die quickly from infections, but have
been kept alive up to eight months, he said, adding that the mice
also produced human antibodies against tetanus.
   The Stanford team gave 300 of the same kind of mice partially
functioning, temporary human immune systems _ lasting two to three
months _ by implanting them with aborted human fetal tissue
containing ``stem cells'' and other building blocks of the human
immune system, McCune said.
   With the consent of abortion patients, the scientists took liver
cells and bits of thymus and lymph glands from the fetuses, then
injected the liver cells into the mice and surgically implanted
pieces of thymus and lymph glands into the rodents.
   The same mice also can be used to study many other human viral
diseases and possible drugs and vaccines against them using ``a
human system outside the human body so you don't have to expose a
human subject to these treatments,'' Katz said.
   McCune and Katz said such diseases include certain leukemias and
other virus-caused cancers; various forms of hepatitis; and herpes
simplex, mononucleosis and other ailments caused by members of the
herpes virus family.
   The mice also could be implanted with a variety of human tissues
and wouldn't reject the tissues. McCune said that would let
scientists use the mice to study the progression of many non-viral
human diseases _ including diabetes, arthritis and cancers _ and
drugs that might treat the diseases.
   Koshland said Science released the Stanford study early because
the La Jolla study was being published and because federal
officials are considering the Reagan administration's proposed ban
on experimental use of aborted human fetal tissue.
   ``This is an excellent example of the carefully scientifically
controlled use of fetal tissue to attack major human disease
problems,'' said Koshland, who opposes the ban.

   Researchers are intrigued by a report
linking a virus to chronic fatigue syndrome, but say more study is
needed before the cause of the mysterious debilitating illness is
known.
   A study released Tuesday said evidence of a type of virus known
as a retrovirus was found in the blood of 23 of 30 victims of the
syndrome. Many of their healthy relatives also showed evidence of
the virus, suggesting it is contagious, the researchers said.
   ``It's very interesting and it definitely needs to be followed
up,'' said Ann Schluederberg, chief of the virology branch of the
National Institutes of Health. She said a more direct
cause-and-effect must be established.
   ``There are things about it that make it not at all implausible
_ just more has to be done,'' she said.
   The findings mean hope for treatment for those who suffer from
the syndrome, and vindication for those who were told the symptoms
were all in their heads.
   ``It's very encouraging, very important,'' said Marya Grambs,
director of the Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome
Foundation in San Francisco,
   ``This is first time anything has been published, but the
information and suspicion has been very clear for a while,'' she
said.
   The foundation _ one of four national groups dedicated to the
illness _ estimates 3 to 10 million Americans are afflicted.
   The disease starts with flulike symptoms and can develop into
overwhelming fatigue and depression. Other symptoms include muscle
and joint pain, headaches, fever, sore throat, memory lapses and
depression.
   Because the symptoms mimic those of many other diseases, it is
often misdiagnosed, she said.
   ``It's so critical that this disease is recognized by the
government and medical community so it can be aggressively
researched, so people who have it can be validated, and not told
they're crazy,'' she said.
   Because it was widely reported among well-educated women in
their 30s and 40s, the syndrome was dubbed ``yuppie flu.''
   The new findings were presented Tuesday at a neuropathology
conference in Kyoto, Japan, by Elaine DeFreitas of the Wistar
Institute in Philadelphia; Dr. Paul Cheney of Charlotte, N.C.; and
Dr. David Bell of Lyndonville, N.Y.
   ``If it turns out to be the agent causing this, then we learn
something about treatment and something about prevention,'' said
Walter J. Gunn, principal CFS investigator for the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta. ``It has the potential to be a very
important study.''
   But the research must be replicated several times before it is
accepted by the scientific and medical community, Gunn said.
   ``This is an extremely tricky area,'' he said. ``It would not be
hard to make a mistake.''
   DeFreitas herself told The Charlotte Observer: ``I don't think
any of us understands what this thing is, or how it's transmitted
or what the role of this agent is in this disease. Certainly the
studies have to be replicated.''
   Using a new laboratory technique, DeFreitas found that nine of
11 adults and 14 of 19 children had blood cells containing a viral
sequence similar to the human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus,
specifically HTLV-II.
   The HTLV family of retroviruses is linked with leukemia, chronic
diseases of the central nervous system and AIDS.
   DeFreitas also checked 10 healthy adults and 10 healthy babies
as controls, and none showed the presence of such virus-positive
blood cells.
   The researchers checked outwardly healthy relatives and close
friends of the CFS patients. They found that 43 percent of those
exposed to the sick adults tested positively and 29 percent of
those exposed to the sick children tested positively.
   ``Retroviruses are not supposed to be casually transmitted among
humans,'' Cheney told the Observer. ``Maybe we found the one that
is.''
   The CDC is conducting a study to estimate how many people have
the disease, Gunn said. The center gets 1,000 to 2,000 phone calls
a month from people who suspect they have CFS, he said.

   The mysterious ailment has been dubbed
``Hollywood Blahs'' and ``Yuppie Disease,'' but to the thousands of
people debilitated by its long list of symptoms, chronic fatigue
syndrome is no joking matter.
   ``Would you make fun of M.S., lupus or other disorders with
similar hardships for patients?'' wrote Gidget Faubion-Jones,
president of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Society, in a letter
complaining about a newspaper cartoon that poked fun at sufferers
and implied the ailment is psychosomatic.
   ``Many of these people are wheelchair-bound, have lost jobs,
savings, relationships, houses and a normal lifestyle,'' she wrote.
   Until recently, many doctors believed the ailment was fictional.
In a March report in the Annals of Internal Medicine, 16
researchers gave it credibility by naming and defining it. The
definition largely involves ruling out other illnesses, though, and
little is known about the syndrome.
   Faubion-Jones' weight dropped to 85 pounds when she first was
struck in 1985. ``I looked like death warmed over. I would have
died if not for a housekeeper who fed and clothed me.''
   While she has overcome the worst symptoms, she said she still
must stay in bed several days a month and finds small tasks
difficult. ``It takes me about four times as long to put on makeup
and to put curlers in my hair. I tend to wear clothes like jump
suits that are easy to put on and take off.''
   Symptoms can include exhaustion, disorientation, sore throat,
depression, fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches and insomnia.
   Lynn Finch, who helped form the society, uses a wheelchair
because walking is so tiring, and keeps her curtains drawn because
direct sunlight bothers her. When she first became ill in 1979, she
tried to continue her job as a hospital nursing supervisor and her
busy home life as a mother of four children.
   ``When I first got the disease I was devastated,'' Finch said.
``I could tell it was progressing. I stopped going to church,
cooking, driving.
   ``I would lie down on the floor at work during coffee breaks and
I would rest during my lunch break. I'd collapse in a chair when I
got home from work. Finally I had to quit my job. ... My kids were
in high school and they wanted Dad and Mom to go to different
events.
   ``To just be stopped in your tracks is hard to take.''
   The society, which now has 12,000 members, was founded in this
Portland suburb three years ago as a support group for local
sufferers of the illness, then called chronic Epstein-Barr virus
syndrome. The group has evolved into an international clearinghouse
of information about the disorder. It sends out a newsletter,
maintains what it says is the largest library of information about
the illness, organizes conferences and distributes information to
the public.
   ``We're recognizing it as a clinical entity to be investigated
and looked at,'' says Dr. John Stewart of the federal Centers for
Disease Control. The Epstein-Barr virus initially was thought to
cause it, but subsequent laboratory investigation dispelled that
theory. The CDC's next step is a 30-person study in the Atlanta
area.
   ``We still don't know what causes it but at least we have a
definition of what it is,'' said Faubion-Jones. ``Science and
technology is finally starting to catch up with this disorder.''
   Meanwhile, she continues to battle those who scoff. Finch,
society vice president Claudia Carver and Faubion-Jones are
exasperated by people who continue to think those suffering the
syndrome are malingerers.
   ``You just suddenly can't do anything,'' Finch says. ``The
American ethic is that if you just try harder, you can overcome
something like this, but that's just not the case.''

   Researchers said they found abnormally low levels of
stress-related hormones among people with chronic fatigue
syndrome, opening a new avenue in the search for a cause of
the disorder.
   The findings by scientists at the National Institutes of
Health suggest that the body's normal responses to stressful
events somehow go awry in people with the syndrome. Symptoms
of the syndrome include extreme lethargy, muscle pain, joint
pain, fever and often neurological deficits and loss of
balance and coordination. It isn't known how many suffer from
the disorder. Its symptoms vary widely and mimic many other
diseases. There isn't any effective treatment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The NIH researchers, whose findings are published in this
month's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,
didn't determine whether the hormone deficiencies are a cause
or an effect of the syndrome. But they do offer an
"alternative explanation" for some symptoms that other
scientists think may be provoked by a virus, said Philip W.
Gold, chief of neuroendocrinology at the National Institute
of Mental Health and principal investigator on the study.
   The NIH scientists compared 30 patients diagnosed with
chronic fatigue syndrome with 72 normal volunteers who served
as controls. They found deficiencies in the chronic fatigue
group in levels of cortisol, a crucial steroid secreted by
the body during periods of stress, and another substance
called corticotropin releasing hormone, or CRH, that
stimulates production of cortisol.
   The two hormones help regulate the body's response to
stressful events, which could range from a viral or bacterial
infection to a psychological event such as a mugging or the
death of a relative.
   CRH also helps increase energy levels, and a CRH
deficiency alone could result in severe fatigue, Dr. Gold
said. Cortisol is a potent chemical restrainer of the body's
immune system and low levels of the hormone could explain why
the immune system in chronic fatigue patients seems to be
hyperactive.

<HEAD>Distress May Spur Immune System in AIDS-Infected Men, Study Says
^Eds: For release at 3 p.m. EDT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychological distress may stimulate the
disease-fighting immune system in men with early AIDS virus
infection, the opposite of its apparent effect in people with
full-blown AIDS, a study suggests.
   That may mean the impact of anxiety, depression and fatigue
depends on how well the immune system is able to respond to such
distress, said researcher Lydia Temoshok.
   It also fits in with a recent suggestion that the AIDS virus may
over-stimulate the immune system early on, leading to its later
exhaustion and collapse, she said. If that is true, strategies to
spur the immune system of infected people may have to be timed to
avoid over-stimulation, she said.
   AIDS kills by crippling the body's immune system, leaving a
person vulnerable to fatal illnesses. Some researchers are studying
whether programs to help deal with stress can help infected people
maintain their immune systems, possibly slowing the progression of
the disease or increasing survival times.
   Temoshok is a senior scientist at the Walter Reed Army Institute
of Research in Washington. She did the new research at the
University of California at San Francisco with colleagues there and
from the University of California at Los Angeles.
   She spoke in an interview before presenting the work Friday at
the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.
   Arthur LaPerriere, research assistant professor of psychiatry at
the University of Miami School of Medicine, called Temoshok's study
preliminary. But he said it may indicate that psychological
intervention can affect the immune systems of people at the stage
of infection she studied.
   Research at his school found that infected men who had no
symptoms showed an increase in immune system white blood cells
after participating in a program that included progressive muscle
relaxation and psychological therapies, he said.
   Temoshok said her work shows only a correlation between distress
levels and activity of the immune system, suggesting but not
proving any cause and effect.
   Previously, her work had linked higher levels of psychological
distress with lower levels of immune system activity in men with
full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   But just the opposite relationship appeared in the new study of
103 men who showed at least one AIDS-related symptom but not the
full disease.
   Distress was measured with standard tests of anxiety, depression
and fatigue. Measures of the immune system included numbers of
T-cells, which are white blood cells that are a key target of the
AIDS virus, and of other white cells. Researchers also measured the
potency of immune system blood cells called natural killer cells.
   Most immune system measures were significantly higher in men
with more anxiety, depression and fatigue, Temoshok said.
   Other studies suggest that distress has the opposite effect on
healthy people, whose immune systems become depressed.
   The researchers do not yet know if the stimulated immune system
has any effect on the progression to full-blown AIDS, she said. So
it is not clear what psychological treatment, if any, would be
useful, she said.
   A possible explanation for the divergent findings of the two
studies is that the impact of distress may depend on the immune
system of a person infected with the AIDS virus, she said.
   Perhaps the relatively well-functioning immune system of a
person with only early AIDS symptoms responds by being stimulated,
while the more crippled immune system of a person with full-blown
AIDS can only be suppressed, she said.

   Ordinarily, such tainted cells display an alien protein on their
surface. It serves as a sort of badge declaring, ``I'm infected.''
But in one of its many tricks, the AIDS virus circumvents this
convention. Some of these infected macrophages are filled with
thousands of viruses, but they are Trojan horses that give no
warning of their cargo. The body, unconcerned, mounts no defense _
even if such a defense would do any good, which, apparently, it
does not.
   Once inside, the infected cells bump into healthy ones and pass
along their contents. Within days, the virus is established in
tissues throughout the body. Several kinds of cells eventually get
infected, including brain cells, B cells that make antibodies and
Langerhans cells, a form of macrophage that penetrates most of the
body's tissues and lives for decades.
   All of them have one thing in common: Their outer skin contains
a molecule called T4. Among them, one variety of blood cell is
special. It is covered with so much T4 that it's called a T4 helper
cell. A single cell may be coated with 60,000 T4 molecules.
   Of all the cells that the virus enters and subverts, the T4
helper cell is the only one it kills directly. Unfortunately, the
helper cell is a critically important soldier in the body's
microbial warfare. It's a kind of master cell that oversees other
branches of the immune system, coordinating their response to
germs. Without them, this intricate system becomes chaotic,
aimless. Parasites that ordinarily don't stand a chance run
rampant. Overwhelming infection and death are the unstoppable
consequences.
   But this final stage of the infection, the phase called AIDS,
may come a decade or more after those first infected macrophages
cross into their new host's bloodstream, full of virus looking for
T4.
   At first, the virus replicates quickly. Large amounts of it are
found in the central nervous system, then in the blood and finally
in other secretions. For a few weeks, the victim may feel sick with
aches and ills that mimic mononucleosis.
   But then the symptoms clear up. Production of virus drops to a
trace. Now the person is an AIDS carrier, able to pass the
infection on the others but looking and feeling perfectly normal.
   For several years, it may seem as though nothing is wrong. But
that is an illusion.
   ``Something is happening during that asymptomatic period that
eventually results in enough damage that the whole system
collapses,'' says Haseltine. ``I think of it as a dam eroding. The
damage is being done, but the dam looks fine.''
   At last the virus comes to life. Levels rise in the bloodstream.
T4 helper cells start to die. And the symptoms of AIDS set in.
Within about two years after those symptoms appear, the number of
T4 cells in the blood inexorably drops to near zero.
   How does HIV get away with it? In the usual course of viral
surveillance, the branch of the immune system called the B cells
recognizes the invader for what it is and makes antibodies. These
are chemicals that tightly latch onto specific spots on the virus's
surface and mark it for destruction.
   People make antibodies against the AIDS virus, too. But they
don't stop the bug. Scientists aren't sure why, although they have
some theories. Perhaps the spots the antibodies need to attach
themselves to are hidden deep in recesses in the virus's coat.
Perhaps they're disguised with a covering of sugar. Maybe the
antibodies bind to the wrong spot on the virus, failing to harm it.
Or maybe the virus simply stays one step ahead, mutating its shell
faster than the body can fashion new antibodies to fit it.
   The virus's coat is made of a sugar and protein combination, or
glycoprotein, called the envelop protein. It has two parts. The
inner one, called gp41, is imbedded in the surface of the virus.
Loosely attached to gp41 is the outer envelop protein, called gp120.
   Gp120 has an intense attraction for the T4 molecule on human
cells. When it finds this target, it binds tightly, holding the
tiny virus to the rough surface of the much larger cell. Then the
gp41 takes over and fuses the membranes of the virus and the cell,
allowing the inner part of the virus to enter the cell.
   Its goal now is to splice its own genes into those of the cell
so it can turn the cell into a virus factory, manufacturing
thousands upon thousands of new copies of itself.
   For HIV, however, that's even more difficult than it sounds, for
this bug is a retrovirus. Like all creatures in nature, the
assembly plans for a new AIDS virus are contained in the coded
material called genes.

<HEAD>High Depression Rates Among Baby Boomers Pose Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``baby boom'' generation, born into relative
affluence, peace and health, is unhappy. Not just a little blue,
but depressed.
   Studies indicate that clinical depression _ lasting at least two
weeks with appetite or sleep disturbance, feelings of worthlessness
or guilt, or thoughts of death _ is hitting earlier in baby boomers
than the preceding generation.
   Female baby boomers, for example, have a 65 percent greater
chance than normal of being depressed some time in their lives. And
the suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds in 1980 was nearly three
times that of the group in 1950.
   ``Depression has changed from a disease of people in their 40s,
50s and older, to a disease of people in their 20s and 30s,'' said
Robert Hirschfeld of the National Institute of Mental Health.
   Nobody really knows why, but Hirschfeld and psychiatry professor
Gerald Klerman, of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,
suspect major changes in the social environment that occurred since
World War II, and the stress of high expectations clashing with
economic reality.
   Baby boomers are not formally defined, but Klerman applies the
term to the 76.2 million babies born from 1947 to 1965, now ranging
from about 23 to 41 years old. They make up about a third of the
United States population.
   Births during the 16-year boom were 50 percent higher than the
previous 16 years and 16 percent above the following 16 years.
   Klerman believes the size of the generation contributed to
higher depression rates, citing a theory by economist Richard
Easterlin of the University of Southern California, who says that
because of supply and demand, a large age group will face lower
wages, higher unemployment and less upward mobility on the job than
smaller age groups.
   Baby-boomers entered that situation with high material
expectations because they grew up in relatively prosperous times.
Despite the economic burden of the big generation, Easterlin said,
they still aspire to material wealth by staying single, or forming
families with working mothers and few if any children.
   ``And the result is a lot of psychological stress,'' Easterlin
said.
   But sociologist Allan Horwitz of Rutgers University said
baby-boomers grew up in ``a very psychological climate, where they
are more attuned to looking within themselves,'' and may be more
prone to react to difficulties by become depressed. Those born
earlier may have just gotten physically sick.

<HEAD>Hydrogen Coolant Offered As Antidote To Ozone-Depleting Freon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simple hydrogen could replace ozone-busting
refrigerants in vehicle air conditioners, one of the leading
sources of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals damaging Earth's
protective radiation shield, a researcher says.
   But the refrigerant industry believes it will find an antidote
to the ozone problem without forcing society to adopt radically
different technology like that being developed by Edward Wallace of
Carnegie Mellon University.
   ``We're hearing a lot about new inventions coming down the
pike,'' says Kevin Fay of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy.
``We're not saying there aren't technological solutions out there
to be found. But the extent to which they're commercially viable
and can be manufactured in millions of units is another question.''
   The estimated 146,000 metric tons of U.S.-produced R-12, the
type of refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioners, accounted for
45 percent of the nation's output of CFCs, Fay says. ``It's the
single largest source of emission of R-12 in the country today.''
   Wallace's air conditioner cools as hydrogen passes between two
beds of material that absorb it at different rates. One bed's
attraction to hydrogen is strong enough to pull it from the other
bed, duplicating the chilling effect of a liquid evaporating. The
stronger bed when heated gives up the hydrogen to the weaker bed,
and the cycle is repeated as needed.
   Hydrogen's flammability is no problem, Wallace says, because
only 2 percent of the hydrogen in his design is ever in its gaseous
state. The rest is locked in chemical compounds in the beds, which
are alloys of iron, nickel and rare earth elements including
lanthanum.
   Similar devices are under development in Israel, Scandanavia and
Europe, where the most rudimentary designs are about as efficient
as conventional air conditioners. Wallace says he won't know how
efficient his is until the components are assembled and tested.

   Gene amplification is transforming the way doctors detect
dozens of ailments, including AIDS and cancer.
   The sleuthing technology, known as the polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR, was invented in 1983 by scientists at Cetus
Corp. and sold to Hoffmann-La Roche, a unit of Roche Holding
Ltd. of Switzerland, this summer. Popularized outside
medicine, PCR has yielded genetic "fingerprints" that have
helped to identify criminal suspects, prehistoric animals and
casualties of the Gulf War.

   But PCR is opening even more windows in diagnostic
medicine, where its ability to pinpoint genes much more
adeptly and quickly than other methods has aided researchers
in identifying the bacteria, viruses and mutant genes that
cause disease. Starting as early as next year, PCR test kits
may become commercially available to clinical labs, moving
the technology further into the medical mainstream.
   "It's changed the way we think about diagnostic medicine,"
says Jeffrey Cossman of Georgetown University School of
Medicine, which this month co-sponsored a conference on the
explosion in uses for PCR and some of the difficulties in
harnessing the technology.
   PCR involves plucking a gene from a sample of blood or
tissue through the use of DNA probes, which bracket the
target much like bookends, and then replicating it as many as
a trillion times. This bit of medical alchemy permits
detection of one cancer cell in a million, making it 1,000 to
10,000 times more sensitive than earlier techniques. That
helps to alert doctors faster to relapses after treatment and
serves as an early warning system for new viral infections
too recent to have sparked symptoms.
   The speed of the technology tantalizes doctors who track
contagious illness. In the case of tuberculosis, says Jack
Crawford of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
"rapid detection using PCR offers the possibility of early
intervention."
   Certainly, the tool isn't fail-safe. PCR produces swarms
of DNA copies that can overrun lab equipment and taint
results of subsequent experiments, leading to as much as a
30% rate of false-positive readings, warns Arthur Hooberman
of the University of Chicago. Cetus scientist John Sninsky
unveiled a new sterilization technique that can prevent such
contamination. But the opposite problem -- that of false
negative results -- occasionally troubles researchers, too.
   Some researchers also worry about some of the practical
implications of PCR's ability to detect the presence of
disease-bearing genes long before symptoms appear. "The key
question is what are we going to do with all this increased
sensitivity," says Dr. Robert Yolken of the Johns Hopkins
pediatrics department. "Will we diagnose more people who are
sick, or will we find out that everyone is carrying small
amounts of virus and do more harm than good?"
   For several years, PCR has been used to detect genes
responsible for such diseases as sickle-cell anemia. Now,
cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs, and Fragile-X
syndrome, a type of retardation, have joined the list of
genetic defects that PCR targets. The National Institutes of
Health recently funded a network of cystic fibrosis screening
projects. Johns Hopkins University geneticist Haig H.
Kazazian says he supports similar screening programs for such
blood disorders as sickle-cell anemia and thalassemia, as
well as for Tay-Sachs disease, a fatal enzyme deficiency.
   Oncologists are using PCR to detect cancer-causing genes
as well as microscopic traces of disease that can lead
malignancies to recur after treatment. They can diagnose
certain lymphomas and leukemias based on a telltale switch in
the location of certain chromosomes.
   In the AIDS epidemic, PCR has a half dozen distinct uses,
according to Gerald Schochetman of the CDC. It solved the
problem of diagnosing newborns, who carry maternal antibodies
that mask their condition in conventional tests. PCR can also
detect HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in newly infected
adults before they make antibodies. Further, PCR can help
track disease progression by measuring how much virus a
patient is carrying.
   PCR is also emerging as a tool for screening donated blood
for HIV. The American Red Cross is planning to use the
technology in its central laboratory in Washington. Says
Gerald Sandler of the Red Cross: "There are 50,000 people to
whom we've said: `You test false-positive so you can't donate
blood.' We'll put in PCR not to detect more {HIV} but to work
toward reinstating those people as blood donors."
   PCR is having a major impact on more common infectious
diseases, too. For herpes virus infections, Thomas Smith of
the Mayo Clinic says, "PCR gives us more diagnostic options"
because it can pick up such hard-to-detect herpes family
members as the Epstein-Barr virus, linked with mononucleosis
and lymphoma, and the papilloma viruses, linked with genital
warts and tumors. Dr. Yolken of Johns Hopkins says PCR can
also detect cases of virusborne diarrhea before antibodies
are produced, making it potentially easier to curb outbreaks
in hospitals and day-care centers.
   For David Persing of the Mayo Clinic, PCR has shed
unexpected historical light on Lyme disease. After combing
through insect museums, he performed PCR on tick specimens
dating from the 1940s, and concluded that the ailment was
around decades earlier than doctors had thought.
   Next month, Roche is launching clinical trials of its
first commercial PCR candidate, a test for chlamydia, a
common sexually transmitted infection, and the company hopes
to file for market approval in the first quarter of 1992.
According to Dr. Yolken, people with infectious chlamydia can
test negative in conventional tests. What's more, the company
says, its test takes only four hours, compared with two days
for other tests.
   Roche has also slated clinical trials for a second
commercial PCR venture, a confirmatory test for HIV, in the
first half of 1992. Further into the future, Roche scientists
are developing a test that can distinguish between the benign
and cancerous types of the papilloma virus.
   Roche says it owns the rights to all present and future
uses of PCR by virtue of a $300 million deal with Cetus in
July.
   Eastman Kodak Co. has asked for a preliminary injunction
to block Cetus's sale of the technology, and a hearing has
been set for Nov. 19 in Delaware. Kodak claims it retained
broad rights to PCR technology from a 1986 contract with
Cetus. Cetus terminated that contract in 1989, when it
licensed diagnostic rights to Roche.
   Would-be competitors are now developing potential
second-generation diagnostic tests similar to PCR. They
include Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., which calls
its technology the ligase chain reaction. Amoco Corp. is
working on another potential contender called
Q-beta-replicase. So promising is the market for such
gene-based tests that Thomas MacMahon, president of the Roche
Diagnostics Group, predicts, "Any major company in the
diagnostics field will want to compete."
   Roche, meanwhile, expects a bonanza from PCR. Mr. MacMahon
predicts that the world-wide market for gene-based diagnostic
tests will reach $500 million by 1995 or 1996 and double to
$1 billion by the year 2000.
   Along with opening up new treatment options for patients,
PCR may also open up business opportunities for drug
companies. Harley Rotbart of the University of Colorado,
Denver, notes that there are 75,000 cases of viral meningitis
and encephalitis annually that can leave their victims --
especially children -- brain-damaged or dead. Because there
was no practical way to test for the enteroviruses at fault
in such cases, a number of companies shelved potentially
helpful drugs.
   With PCR, "now there is a way to test," says Dr. Rotbart.
He hopes to launch clinical trials of antiviral drugs by
Schering Plough Corp., the G.D. Searle unit of Monsanto Co.
and the Sterling Winthrop unit of Kodak.

<TEXT>     The study showed that injections of the medicine Ampligen restored patients
enough so they had the strength to take care of themselves and think more
clearly, although many still showed some effects of the disease. The medicine
is the first to have any proven impact on the mysterious illness.;   Dr.
William Carter of Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, co-inventor of
Ampligen, presented the findings at an American Society for Microbiology
meeting.;   Besides opening the possibility of a treatment for the disorder,
the research also provides clues to its cause. It suggests that viruses are
ultimately responsible for the illness, but the body's own response to the
infection may make the symptoms much worse.;   Although the disease may have
been around for hundreds of years, current concern about the illness emerged
after doctors in Incline Village, a resort on Lake Tahoe in Nevada, witnessed
an unusual cluster of people with unexplained fatigue in 1984.;   When similar
cases turned up elsewhere, many doctors dismissed it as part of a
psychological disorder, perhaps depression. For a time, it was disparagingly
called yuppie flu.;   Now, the disease is taken seriously. In the latest
study, doctors at four hospitals in Portland, Ore., Houston, Incline Village
and Charlotte, N.C., tested Ampligen on 92 people whose lives had been ruined
by chronic fatigue syndrome. Half received Ampligen injections for up to six
months; the rest got placebo shots.;   Before treatment, the patients needed
custodial care. They could not cook, shop or reliably perform the simplest
household tasks.;   "As a result of Ampligen therapy, the typical patient went
from needing help most of the time to only needing help now and then for
sustained tasks, such as cutting the grass," said Carter.  </TEXT>

   Increasing Incidence of a Lymph Cancer
   Seen Among Long-Term AIDS Survivors

   SAN FRANCISCO -- In a new twist in the decade-long AIDS
epidemic, doctors say many AIDS patients are beating
infections and living longer only to develop an aggressive
cancer of the lymph system.
   As better treatments succeed in repelling infections,
patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome may survive
the once life-threatening episodes of pneumonia and other
sicknesses to live years longer than they once did. However,
the erosion of their immune system leaves them vulnerable to
a virulent form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the
B-cells produced in the body's lymph nodes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trend represents a major shift in the course of the
epidemic and a setback for the group that previously had
embodied the most hope -- those patients who were long-term
survivors. Meanwhile, what role the drug AZT may play in the
development of lymphoma is unclear, suggesting a new
direction for future AIDS research. Questions surrounding the
drug, which is made by Wellcome PLC, London, are sure to
provoke debate, especially from gay activists who feel AZT
has unfairly dominated the nation's research agenda. Efforts
to reach a Wellcome spokesman were unsuccessful over the
weekend.
   Doctors at major AIDS centers are reporting a steep surge
in the number of AIDS-related lymphoma cases this year. "In
the first three months of 1990, we've more than doubled the
rate from prior years," says Lawrence Kaplan, of the
University of California at San Francisco. "It's an
extraordinary number of what we think of as a fairly unusual
disease."
   At New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, almost 10% of
advanced AIDS patients develop the lymphoma -- virtually all
of them while taking the drug AZT. Other centers see more,
increasing with length of diagnosis and time on AZT.
   The trend "is real and important. It represents the
clinical evolution of AIDS," says Jerome E. Groopman of the
Deaconess Hospital. Where patients once succumbed after a
swift bout of pneumonia, AZT plus aerosol pentamidine and
other drugs now allay the acute danger of death from
infection, he says. Now, doctors see more chronic
neurological problems, and a wasting syndrome, but the most
striking new feature is the lymphoma, Dr. Groopman says.
"AIDS is a changing disease," Dr. Groopman cautions. "We have
to be flexible and ready to address new clinical events as
they arise."
   Cancer has been associated with AIDS from the start.
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a tumor of blood vessels, was the
earliest AIDS-linked malignancy to appear, but its incidence
has declined while lymphoma's has surged. In San Francisco,
for example, KS cases grew at a 2% annual rate in 1986 and
1987, the most recent years for which figures are available,
while lymphoma cases soared 48%, according to a report
published last week by the National Cancer Institute.
   Moreover, cancer is a risk for anyone with a weakened
immune system. People who receive organ transplants run a
heightened risk of cancer due to the immunosuppressive drugs
they take to prevent transplant rejection. Children with
congenital diseases like SCID (severe combined immune
deficiency) also develop more than their share of tumors.
   Studies in the U.S. show lymphoma also is on the rise in
elderly men for unknown reasons, possibly due to herbicides
or other environmental factors, says Robert Yarchoan, a
senior scientist at the National Cancer Institute.
   Still, the rate of AIDS lymphoma -- now approaching 20% or
more for the most advanced patients on AZT -- is two to three
times the expected rate of such cancer in other immune
deficiencies, and even in early AIDS.
   "The critical question is whether AZT is acting to enhance
the lymphoma, or whether the lymphoma is the outcome of a
prolonged immune deficiency," says Dr. Groopman. "Clearly,
people with AIDS develop lymphoma even when they aren't
taking AZT, as do people with organ transplants."
   The mystery of AIDS lymphoma may involve several factors
acting in concert to set the stage for cancer: AIDS, another
microbe, and genetic damage.
   About half of the AIDS lymphoma tumors contain a second
virus, Epstein-Barr virus, a member of the herpes family that
is already implicated in certain other cancers, Dr. Groopman
says.
   Other AIDS lymphomas contain evidence of genetic damage:
breaks in certain chromosomes, or expression of an oncogene,
or cancer-promoting gene, called "myc."
   "You might see that a patient today living four years with
AIDS -- in contrast with someone in 1984 who lived two years
-- might have more such chromosomal damage," Dr. Groopman
said. "My gut feeling is that it's not AZT," he added, but he
plans further studies to investigate the drug's possible
role.
   AZT has been reported to cause vaginal tumors in rodents,
but "We think that's a different mechanism," Dr. Yarchoan of
the cancer institute said. Such a rise in vaginal tumors
hasn't been reported among women on AZT.
   Dr. Kaplan of San Francisco suggests that a potential clue
to lymphoma's origin lies in one of the very first visible
symptoms of AIDS infection: swollen lymph nodes.
   "Those lymph nodes are swollen because B-cells are going
wild," he says. "They're hyperactive and proliferating, so
that they can make antibodies to the AIDS virus. When you
have a patient in that situation, it stands to reason that
the longer their B-cells are proliferating, the greater the
chance that some second event will come along -- either a
second virus, or a spontaneous genetic {mutation}."
   By Dr. Kaplan's reckoning, AZT contributes only "in an
extremely roundabout way, by making people live longer so
they get these malignancies."
   Whatever the cause or causes, the prognosis for patients
with AIDS lymphoma is poor, with an average survival time of
about six months. Treatment so far is limited to the
conventional array of anticancer drugs. Many patients,
however, are too ill to withstand the rigors of chemotherapy,
because their bone marrow is depleted by the disease or by
AZT. Dr. Groopman's clinic has three patients in complete
remission, who are alive three years after treatment of their
lymphoma, but more often the cancer recurs, he says.
   "In the worst-case scenario, we often see a situation like
that with Burkitt's lymphoma, where tumors double in size
overnight," says Dr. Kaplan. "You see a patient, and the next
day, his tumor has grown visibly."
   "They are very aggressive tumors, found in the brain,
lung, and gastrointestinal tract," says Dr. Yarchoan. Unlike
classic B-cell lymphomas, which often crop up in the lymph
nodes, AIDS lymphomas often hide in the brain where their
symptoms may be mistaken for AIDS dementia, which is often
caused by toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection.
   "It's not uncommon for the lymphoma to be undiagnosed,"
says Parkash Gill, of the University of California Medical
School in Los Angeles. "So for many cases, it may be
unreported."
   Experts are bracing for a rise in the number of lymphoma
cases. "I believe we'll see more of these cases as a result
of antiretroviral therapy, and treatment of opportunistic
infections," Dr. Yarchoan agrees, adding that he and his
colleagues at the cancer institute are analyzing AIDS
patients who developed lymphoma while participating in
treatment studies.

   Researchers at the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
will conduct a five-year study of the rate at which some people who
receive transplanted organs develop cancer.
   In the process, the $5 million study _ funded by the National
Cancer Institute _ may provide clues to the relationship between
cancer and viruses and the way in which the body combats those
diseases, one official said Tuesday.
   ``It has broad implications for better understanding of
mechanisms that lead to the development of cancer,'' said Dr.
Theresa Whiteside, director of the institute's immunologic
monitoring and diagnostic laboratory and a professor of pathology
at the University of Pittsburgh.
   About 400 adults and children who have received transplants will
be recruited to participate in the study.
   Whiteside said one of the most significant aspects of the study
is that researchers will be able to study a large group of people,
some of whom they know will develop cancer.
   It will build on observations made in 1975 by Pittsburgh liver
transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl, who discovered when he was at
the University of Colorado that 2 to 3 percent of all transplant
recipients developed cancer.
   The most common malignancies diagnosed among those patients were
lymph node cancer, liver cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer
also common among AIDS patients.
   Starzl, along with Dr. Israel Penn, also found that the risk of
cancer after a transplant increased to 10 percent for patients
whose pre-transplant tests showed they did not have antibodies to
the Epstein Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis.
   About 80 percent of those patients become infected with the
virus after transplantation, and researchers believe there is some
correlation between that and the development of cancer,
particularly in the lymph nodes.
   Researchers also will try to determine why liver transplant
recipients whose previous liver was removed because of cancer often
develop the cancer again with the new organ.
   In such patients, the cancer does not show up in other parts of
the body.
   ``We are not even sure if it is the same cancer that returns to
the new liver or a new cancer that arises in the liver. Nothing is
known about this,'' she said.
   The return of cancer, Whiteside said, must have something to do
with a person's immune system after transplantation or the immune
defenses within the liver itself.
   Transplant patients get drugs to suppress their body's natural
defenses after surgery to prevent rejection of the new organs, and
the drugs also make the patients susceptible to other infections.

But the Effectiveness of One Is in Dispute

   The Third International Conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome received word of two new drugs -- one coming in a quiet scholarly publication and the other amid the sound and fury of a scientific-political battle -- that may fight the disease. 

   The drugs are Ampligen, produced by HEM Research Inc., a private Rockville, Md., company now in partnership with Du Pont Co.; and Peptide T, a substance identified by Candace B. Pert of the National Institute of Mental Health, a unit of the National Institutes of Health. 

   Both drugs have been subjected to small preliminary human tests. 
Now both are entering larger, random trials where each will be pitted against placebos, or dummy drugs, and judged by doctors without knowledge of who's getting what. 
That's where their similarity ends. 

   Mild side effects and some very preliminary clinical benefits resulted when Ampligen was given to 10 patients with AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), or the lymphadenopathy syndrome -- swollen glands that often precede AIDS or ARC. 
The report by HEM in collaboration with scientists at Vanderbilt University and elsewhere, will appear in tomorrow's edition of the Lancet, a British medical journal. 

   Scientists reported that six of seven patients with AIDS or ARC showed a reduction in the AIDS virus in their blood after receiving the drug. 
All 10 patients had improved immune response as measured by skin tests, and seven of eight experienced stable or increased levels of T-helper cells, key sentries of the immune system. 
A variety of clinical symptoms abated, including swollen glands, yeast infections, fatigue and weight loss. 
Side effects included nausea and flulike symptoms. 

   "This really is a biological response modifier," said William Mitchell, professor of pathology at Vanderbilt University. 
He said it triggers a cascade of effects, including production of interferons and tumor necrosis factor, and activation of enzymes thought to be steps in the body's efforts to fight viruses. 

   David Jackson, director of biotechnology research for Du Pont, said HEM is now enrolling 200 patients for the controlled trial. 
He said it isn't yet known whether the drug crosses the critical blood-brain barrier to reach the AIDS virus where it hides in the brain. 
Nor is it known whether the drug can penetrate macrophages, cells thought to help spread the AIDS infection throughout the body. 

   The Peptide T protein, which Dr. Pert believes blocks the AIDS virus's access to T-cells and thus thwarts infection, has just been approved for testing in AIDS patients in the U.S. 

   But a bitter controversy erupted at the AIDS conference over which scientists believe Dr. Pert's work and which don't. 
Dr. Pert's work was corroborated by scientists at the Oncogen unit of Bristol-Myers, but disputed by William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute of Boston. 
Dr. Haseltine said six other academic and industrial labs share his skepticism. 

   So far only four patients have received Peptide T in a small pilot study by Lennart Wetterberg of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. 
Dr. Wetterberg gave the protein to the patients for one month last fall, and again this spring. 

   Dr. Wetterberg asserted Peptide T may help clear the brain infection and dementia caused by the AIDS virus, and to that end showed a slide of one patient's brain depicting a retreat of disease. 
But he cautioned, "The clinical relevance of this slide remains to be elucidated." 

   One patient experienced a clearing of severe psoriasis, which though rarely discussed in connection with AIDS, was said by Dr. Wetterberg to be a complication of the disease. 
Two other patients are described as stable and back at work. 
A fourth died after withdrawing from the study. 

   "A controlled study began last month in 50 patients," Dr. Wetterberg said. 
"If Peptide T has any clinical relevance, it certainly remains to be proven." 

   In the field of AIDS diagnostic tests, there's new hope for bringing fast, simple AIDS blood tests to hard-hit central Africa, where 5% to 18% of blood donors carry the virus. 

   Companies are devising faster, simpler ways to detect antibodies that tell doctors whether someone has been infected by the virus. 
Cambridge Bioscience Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass., with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is developing a two-minute antibody test that doesn't require sophisticated equipment or refrigeration and "may not require confirmation" by a second test, says Thomas Quinn, a scientist at the institutes.

   The number of white blood cells infected
by the AIDS virus rises sharply in the year before virus-infected
males actually develop the disease, says a study that may lead to
speedier treatment for AIDS victims.
   While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected
cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test
that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown
AIDS, said the CDC's Janet Nicholson.
   Such a test would help doctors decide when the benefits of
giving patients certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks,
said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the
University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director
at San Francisco General Hospital.
   ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of
developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point,
even if he hadn't developed full-blown AIDS,'' he said.
   Nicholson, the CDC's clinical immunology chief, presented her
findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology.
   She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing blood
cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the virus
and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn't suffer AIDS.
   Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said.
   She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the
six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected
peripheral blood mononuclear cells _ a class of white blood cells.
   If a simple test could show that someone infected with the virus
soon will get AIDS, doctors could better decide when to prescribe
AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other
infections that kill AIDS patients once the virus has crippled
their immune systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is
believed to slow progression of AIDS.
   From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person's risk of
developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,'' he said.
   But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some
AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will
develop disease symptoms.
   Nicholson said researchers previously knew that people infected
with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting
white blood cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection
progresses.
   Her study found that the number of helper cells decreases more
quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in
infected patients who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms.
   ``It's not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will
develop disease,'' she said, adding that her findings point the way
toward determining which patients are likely to do so.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to death from infections and cancer.
   The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have
been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30
percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991.

Efforts to Quell Virus Involves
Use of AZT, Acyclovir
By Symptom-Free Men

   The San Francisco Public Health Department will soon launch a test of antiviral drugs in so-called healthy carriers of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. 

   The test will team up the anti-AIDS drug azidothymidine, or AZT, with the anti-herpes drug acyclovir against the AIDS virus in men who are infected but thus far free of symptoms. 
The effort is designed to find an agent that can prevent the development of AIDS. 
It is believed that 20% to 30% of patients who test positive for AIDS antibodies fall ill within five to six years of being infected. 

   The maker of both drugs, Burroughs-Wellcome Co. of Research Triangle Park, N.C., a unit of London-based Wellcome PLC, is sponsoring the test in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the University of California and the San Francisco Health Department. 

   The test represents the first practical step toward a chemical preventive against AIDS for the estimated 1.5 million to two million Americans now infected with the virus, noted Paul O'Malley, project director for the San Francisco City Clinic AIDS research study. 
Mr. O'Malley's group since 1978 has been following 6,700 gay San Franciscans. 
Of those 6,700, 70% are believed to carry the virus. 

   The study initially will involve 20 men in a phase-one -- or safety-study -- that is expected to start in April, Mr. O'Malley said. 
Phase-two trials, testing effectiveness of the drug combination, will be expanded to involve 400 to 600 men. 
AZT was shown last fall to prolong the lives and reduce the symptoms of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex. 
As reported previously, AZT -- which has a planned brand name of Retrovir -- was recommended last month for market approval by a panel of the Food and Drug Administration. 
Acyclovir, known commercially as Zovirax, is a treatment for herpes. 

   The idea for the AZT-acyclovir combination was "serendipity," Mr. O'Malley said. 
In last year's large AZT study, he explained, patients who were being treated simultaneously with acyclovir for recurrent herpes appeared to do "much better than the group as a whole. 
The theory is that there may be some synergy between the two drugs." 

   Mr. O'Malley added that by combining the two drugs, the test will seek to reduce the customary doses of AZT, thus avoiding the debilitating anemias that can be a side-effect of the drug and that have weakened some AIDS patients, necessitating transfusions and interrupting or halting treatment. 

   AZT and acyclovir both work by tricking viruses to accept chemical impostors into their DNA, thus breaking the genetic chain of the virus and blocking its reproduction. 

   Mr. O'Malley said the test is the first to offer hope of preventing AIDS in people who have tested positive for the AIDS antibody. 
"We have had some men who previously declined (to hear) their test results, who now think it's in their interest to know because they finally can take action," he said. 

   More than 30,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been diagnosed in the U.S., and 271,000 cases are projected by the U.S. Public Health Service by 1991.

   Schering-Plough Interferon Drug Shows
   Promise Treating Hepatitis B in Study

   More than one-third of patients afflicted with chronic
hepatitis B were treated successfully with Schering-Plough
Corp.'s version of interferon, a large team of medical
researchers reported.
   The report is the first time researchers have claimed
success in treating a form of hepatitis that afflicts about
5% of the world's population. It is the most serious form of
hepatitis in that many infected persons develop a chronic
form of hepatitis in which the virus continues to multiply in
the liver for years afterward, often leading to cirrhosis or
liver cancer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The researchers reported that daily injections of
interferon for 16 weeks stopped the hepatitis B virus from
multiplying in 40% of the patients who had suffered a chronic
state of active virus infection and hepatitis for as long as
seven years.
   Most of the patients who were successfully treated
apparently became "silent" or inactive carriers of the
hepatitis B virus. But in 10% of the patients, most of whom
had had hepatitis B for less than two years, the interferon
treatment appeared to eliminate the virus, the researchers
reported.
   "We can cure people who might otherwise have a lifelong
infection with serious consequences if we get to them early
enough," said Robert P. Perrillo, associate professor of
medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Perrillo
headed the team of scientists from a dozen medical schools
and Schering-Plough who tested the interferon treatment.
   Hepatitis B, once known as serum hepatitis, is transmitted
sexually, through contaminated needles, through blood
transfusions or from infected mother to child. It differs
from hepatitis A, which is usually transmitted in
sewage-contaminated food. In the U.S., hepatitis B afflicts
less than 1% of the population and is most often seen in
sexually promiscuous people, homosexual males, drug addicts,
health care workers and infants born to mothers who are
carriers. In parts of Africa and Asia, however, hepatitis B
afflicts and is carried by about 20% of the population.
   The report, published in this week's issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, is the second coup in as many
days for Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b, which it sells
under the brand name Intron A. Tuesday, an advisory group of
medical experts recommended that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approve the company's request to sell Intron A
for the treatment of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis, a
catchall designation for hepatitis in which blood tests fail
to detect the A or B virus.
   A company spokesman said Schering-Plough applied to the
FDA last October for clearance to make claims that Intron A
was effective in hepatitis B but hasn't yet received such
approval. It took 13 months for the approval of Intron A's
use in non-A, non-B hepatitis.
   The interferon treatment isn't cheap. The Schering-Plough
spokesman said that the average retail cost to the patient
would be about $5,000 for the full 16-week course of shots
used in the hepatitis B experiment.
   Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b is one of two
genetically engineered interferons on the market. Roche
Holdings Ltd.'s Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J., sells
interferon alfa-2a, which has some slight molecular
differences from the Schering-Plough product. Both
interferons are sold for the treatment of a type of leukemia
and for the Kaposi's sarcoma cancer that hits many patients
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The tests of interferon alfa-2b in hepatitis B involved
169 patients who had had chronic hepatitis B for at least six
months. Because the outward clinical symptoms of the disease
vary widely from none to severe fatigue, the diagnosis of
hepatitis B was confirmed in liver biopsies and by blood
tests that indicated the virus was actively multiplying in
the liver.
   In the experiment, 85 of the patients were taught to give
themselves daily shots of five million units of interferon
for 16 weeks. Periodic blood tests over the following months
indicated that in 31 of these patients, the virus had quit
multiplying in the liver. In addition, the blood tests on 10
of the patients indicated the virus had disappeared.
   By contrast, of 43 patients whose daily shots were of a
placebo or inert substance, only three showed a spontaneous
loss of virus multiplication, and blood tests indicated all
continued to harbor the virus. Another set of 41 patients
received only one million units of interferon daily. In this
group the virus became inactive in seven and disappeared in
one patient.
   Half of the patients receiving the maximum five million
units of interferon also had been pretreated with a steroid
hormone that had shown some benefit in other forms of
hepatitis. The steroid treatment, however, seemed to make
little difference in the overall results.
   So far, only two patients have experienced a reactivation
of the virus, although the researchers cautioned that a
long-term follow-up is needed to determine the treatment's
efficacy and to find out whether it reduces the risk of
cirrhosis and liver cancer.
   The major adverse effects of the interferon treatment were
changes in appetite, insomnia, acne and flu-like symptoms
such as fatigue, fever and headache.

<LEADPARA>  THERE are an estimated 600,000 polio survivors in the United States. Of these,
researchers say, about a third have or will develop the symptoms of post-polio
syndrome.;    The principal symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, joint
and muscle pain and, in some, respiratory problems. Large numbers of polio
survivors first noticed these problems in the early 1980s -- 30 years after
the polio epidemics of the early 1950s. In the intervening decades, many
people recovered much or all of their strength and lived active lives. The
onset of new symptoms is enormously frustrating, and so there is a
psychological component to the syndrome for many.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The polio virus, when it struck years ago, caused only diarrhea, nausea or
flu-like symptoms in many people. But in others, it infected nerve cells in
the spine that control muscular movements. Many of these nerve cells, known as
anterior horn cells, died or were damaged, resulting in the degeneration of
the nerve connections to various muscles.;    This left many muscle fibers
"orphaned" -- without connections to the central nervous system -- and caused
full or partial paralysis. Through physical rehabilitation and exercise,
patients often were able to strengthen their muscles. In addition, their
bodies kicked in on their own over the years -- by sprouting new connections
between healthy nerve cells in the spine and orphaned muscle fibers.;    In
effect, diminished numbers of healthy nerve cells in the spine were driving
the muscular movements of polio survivors. Through sheer willpower, many
managed to walk and function at active levels for years. But they exerted
enormous amounts of energy while performing routine tasks.;    After 30 years,
overworked muscles and nerves could no longer perform as before and many
survivors began experiencing extreme fatigue. Muscle weakness and aches and
pains also were caused by the overuse and wearing down of muscles, nerves and
ligaments -- although there are sometimes more mundane causes, such as pinched
nerves or the discomfort of sitting in a wheelchair for years.;    Finally, in
the original polio scenario, the virus sometimes infected anterior horn cells
in the brain stem. This caused respiratory or swallowing problems. Some of
these patients were placed in iron lungs to assist their breathing, but were
able to stop that treatment after a number of months. After 30 years, some of
these patients are once again developing respiratory difficulties.  </TEXT>

On Drug Intended to Delay Onset of AIDS

   Researchers at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia soon will present preliminary studies on Ampligen, a new drug they believe may delay the onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS, in people infected by the virus. 

   David R. Strayer, a professor in Hahnemann's department of neoplastic diseases, is scheduled to present the findings tomorrow at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Washington, D.C. 

   The Ampligen study is expected to draw an unusual level of scientific scrutiny because of the intense interest in the drug by AIDS patients and their advocates. 

   Ampligen, a drug fashioned from double-stranded RNA, ribonucleic acid, is being developed as a joint venture of closely held HEM Research Inc. of Rockville, Md., and Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Du Pont closed at $76.75, down $1.25. 

   Dr. Strayer said that after treatment with Ampligen, a group of 25 patients with AIDS-related complex, ARC, or with lymphadenopathy -- a condition characterized by swollen glands -- often found in pre-AIDS patients -- experienced a stabilization of their immune systems. 

   He said this stabilizing effect was seen in the increase in the number of T4 cells, which are key protectors of the immune system. 
Patients overall experienced a 4.5% rise in the number of cells after four months of treatment, 8% after eight months, and 17% after a year. 
However, he noted only six patients had been on Ampligen for a full year, so the sample size was very small. 

   In addition, the patients in the Ampligen study had relatively healthy immune systems at the start of the trial, with a mean T4 count of 332. (By contrast, the drug AZT, which is used to treat AIDS and severe ARC patients, is approved only in patients whose T4 count has dropped below 200.) 

   In a normal, healthy individual, T4 cells can range from a high of 1400 to a low of 700. 
In most AIDS patients, the level of T4 cells has declined to between 50 and 100. 
Most ARC patients have a T4 count between 50 and 200, according to Jerome Groopman, a researcher at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. 
The Ampligen study included some patients whose T4 cells were as high as 400, with the mean at about 332. 

   There weren't any "clinically significant" side-effects, said Dr. Strayer, but he noted that some patients experienced mild muscle aches and fatigue. 
He added that more patients, however, experienced a lessening of fatigue, along with abatement of night sweats and diarrhea. 

   Dr. Strayer acknowledged in an interview that the healthier the subjects, the more significant Ampligen's effects, but he emphasized the aim was to prevent illness in infected people, not cure AIDS. 

   He said patients also experienced a 26% decrease in the levels of the AIDS virus in their blood. 
Overall, he added, the patients' weight remained stable, and about 80% experienced a restoration of the ability of their immune system to react to a certain skin test, which is commonly administered by researchers to measure the strength of the immune system. 

   The drug didn't seem to affect symptoms of patients already ill with AIDS, however. 
Of five patients with AIDS who were treated with Ampligen, one died after a second bout of pneumonia. 
Four AIDS patients in the study who had previously had Kaposi's Sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer, all experienced a worsening of their cancer and were removed from the study, Dr. Strayer said. 

   "We're not making a claim for this drug (Ampligen) for AIDS or for anything right now. 
What we're looking at is a stabilization of T4 cells which would probably have gone down if untreated," Dr. Strayer said. 
"We're hoping that you could delay progression to AIDS by stimulating the immune system and by inhibiting the virus." 

   But several outside researchers, including Mr. Groopman, contended the Ampligen study subjects were too few, and too healthy, and the claimed improvements too slight to draw any conclusions whatever. 

   "With the small sample size, and the relatively high T4-cell counts, it's hard to tell if there's any real immune improvement," said Mr. Groopman. 
He said he had followed a number of similarly healthy ARC patients "who remain stable with no treatment at all." 

   "This doesn't mean the drug isn't good," he added, "but they're obligated to do a much larger trial" to give their claims a fair test. 

   Indeed, Dr. Strayer said the study currently is being expanded to eight from three centers in a test of Ampligen against a placebo, or medically inactive substance, to determine whether the treated patients in fact fare better. 
That test is expected to take about a year to complete.

   The onset of AIDS in people with mild
infections of the HIV virus can be delayed with early treatment of
AZT and makes it ``almost a whole new drug,'' a leading researcher
said.
   A study released Monday in the May 15 issue of the Annals of
Internal Medicine said people who took AZT were more than twice as
likely not to develop AIDS or AIDS-related complex than those who
received a placebo.
   That study and a similar one last month in the New England
Journal of Medicine prompted the federal Food and Drug
Administration in March to allow physicians to prescribe the drug
for patients with the virus who have not developed AIDS symptoms.
   ``It means we can recommend intervention to prevent serious
illness just as we would for mild hypertension to prevent stroke or
heart disease,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl, lead author of the study
in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
   ``The data shows remarkably that if you give zidovudine (AZT)
orally before someone's immune system is severely damaged or they
are severely ill, you will delay development of AIDS,'' she said.
   Because AZT is ``licensed for almost all phases of HIV
infection,'' she said, it represented ``a quantum leap in treatment
intervention.''
   She said the study also showed ``the drug was well-tolerated,
with minimum side effects.'' Only 1 percent of those getting the
minimum dose experienced serious side effects, she said.
   AZT is the only drug definitively shown to at least slow the
usually fatal course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The latest study examined 711 people with mild symptoms of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, or HIV, the precursor to
AIDS. A placebo was given to 351 people while AZT was given to 360.
   Of those getting the drug, 15 developed AIDS or AIDS-related
complex within about 11 months. Of those who did not receive the
drug, 36 developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
   The results were more conclusive for those with more advanced
HIV infection.
   The illness is measured by the concentration of CD4 T
lymphocytes, a cell important in forming antibodies. The lower the
count, the more advanced the illness.
   Among those whose CD4 T lymphocyte count fell between 200 and
500 per square millimeter, 34 subjects who received the placebo
developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex, compared with 12 who
received AZT.
   Among those whose CD4 T lymphocyte count fell between 500 and
799, two subjects who received the placebo developed AIDS or
AIDS-related complex, compared with three who received AZT.
   In an editorial, researchers from the University of British
Columbia cautioned treating patients with counts between 200 and
500.
   ``The available data do not address the question of whether
early intervention ... prolongs life or improves its quality,'' the
editorial said.
   ``Whereas the selective use of zidovudine in such persons should
be endorsed for the present, we eagerly await the results of
ongoing trials that will help resolve these important issues,'' the
editorial said.

   More research is needed before injections of
immunoglobulin blood cells are used generally to treat babies with
AIDS, a National Institutes of Health committee said Wednesday.
   The committee made the recommendation after studying the uses of
an treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIG,
which is becoming widely used for a variety of illnesses related to
the immune system.
   Dr. Peter E. Lipsky, the committee chairman and a professor at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said that
although IVIG has been reported in one limited study as useful in
treating newborns with AIDS, there have been no clinical trials to
prove its value.
   ``The treatment is unpleasant,'' said Lipsky. ``If it doesn't
afford much benefit, it doesn't make sense to subject them to this
expensive treatment.''
   Clinical trials are now underway, the committee said, to
determine if the IVIG therapy can help babies born with AIDS to
develop natural defenses against disease.
   The panel was organized to establish a medical consensus for the
uses of IVIG. The immunoglobulin therapy has been approved to treat
some types of immune deficiency diseases, but experimental uses
have developed what Lipsky called ``anecdotal evidence'' that IVIG
may be useful in treating other illnesses.
   Immunoglobulin is the antibody component of human blood.
Antibodies are disease-fighting proteins made by the body's immune
system. Antibodies will attack any bacteria, virus, tissue, cell or
substance that that appear foreign to the host body.
   Doctors have used human antibody shots for years to protect
patients from a variety of infections or to boost a patient's
immune system. But the shots are very painful and, as a result,
were used only when no other therapy was available.
   In the 1980s, however, pharmaceutical companies developed a way
to process immunoglobulin so that it can be injected into veins.
This is far less painful and enables doctors to use massive amounts.
   Lipsky said the new treatment had such a dramatic effect on
patients with immune problems that many doctors began using IVIG to
treat other conditions.
   ``The enthusiasm has caused there to be lots of therapeutic
adventurism,'' said Lipsky. He said the NIH committee was
established to determine which of the new treatments actually work.
   The committee recommended that IVIG continue to be used for
patients whose immune systems do not create natural antibodies, a
condition called primary immunodeficiency.
   IVIG is also appropriate, the committee said, for reducing
infection among patients who have received bone marrow transplants
or who have chronic lymphatic leukemia.
   The committee said IVIG also has been shown effective among
children who develop Kawasaki syndrome, an inflammatory disease
that often causes heart disease.
   Lipsky said that though there have been limited examples of IVIG
preventing infection among premature babies and relieving symptoms
of such disorders as arthritis or brain seizures, the committee
could not recommend IVIG for those uses until further study is done.
   Seven companies now produce IVIG, but Lipsky said the therapy
continues to be very expensive. IVIG treatment for some patients
with chronic immune system problems may cost up to $5,000 monthly,
he said.

<TEXT>
   A new strain of virus isolated from an African
blood sample by a California research team attacks with a lethal
AIDS-like infection that scientists say cannot yet be explained,
according to a report published Friday.
   Jay A. Levy, leader of the University of California at San
Francisco team that conducted the study, said the new isolated
virus strain is able to cause a fatal infection but does so without
killing cells in the human body.
   This suggests, said Levy, that the lethal mechanism of the virus
is different from the AIDS virus that is infecting and killing
Americans.
   Still another new virus strain from the family that causes
AIDS-like disease in Africa has been isolated by a team at the
University of Alabama, Birmingham. This new strain appears to be
less virulent than AIDS viruses identified earlier, said George M.
Shaw, leader of the Alabama research group.
   Both studies of the new virus strains are reported in Friday's
issue of the journal Science.
   The new isolates found by the researchers are both strains of
human immunodeficiency virus two, or HIV2. This virus is a subtype
of the HIV1 that is blamed for the AIDS epidemic in the United
States.
   Both HIV1 and HIV2 have been found in AIDS patients in Africa,
but only one patient has been found in the United States to be
infected with HIV2. That patient, who died in this country, is
believed to have been infected in Africa.
   Levy said his group isolated its strain of HIV2 from a blood
sample taken from a native of Mali who was hospitalized in Ivory
Coast, a West African nation. He said the patient suffered from
chronic diarrhea and weight loss and died last fall from neurologic
complications, all symptoms seen in AIDS patients.
   But Levy said the researchers are unable to say how the virus
caused these disease symptoms.
   In laboratory studies of U.S. AIDS cases, the HIV1 virus has
been found to infect cells in the blood, brain, bowel and bone
marrow, and to kill cells in the immune system. Levy said that
while the new strain of HIV2 will infect a variety of cells in
laboratory tests, it will not kill the cells.
   ``It doesn`t have to kill (cells) to cause disease,'' he said.
He suggested that the new strain may infect cells of the brain and
bowel and paralyze the cellular function, or force the cells to
make products that are toxic to the body.
   ``The key here is that maybe all HIV viruses do this,'' Levy
said. ``Maybe killing cells is something we see in the laboratory,
but it is not a major aspect in disease induction in a person. That
is where we're looking now.''
   Shaw said the HIV2 strain found by his group was isolated from a
blood sample taken from a healthy prostitute in Senegal, West
Africa.
   Shaw said his team now is looking at the genetic differences
that cause one type of HIV virus to kill infected cells, while
another strain does not.
   ``This will provide an important scientific tool to study the
cellular and biological basis for (cell-killing disease),'' he
said. ``All of this can be combined to better understand the
biology of the HIV family of viruses.''
   Levy said there are many strains of HIV viruses and scientists
will need to understand their diversity and commonality to develop
an antiviral medication that will work against all types of AIDS
infections.
   Howard Streicher, one of the leading AIDS researchers at the
National Institutes of Health, said isolation of the two strains of
HIV2 virus gives an important advance in the war against the killer
disease.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has been shown
among U.S. patients to kill by destroying the body's immune system.
This leaves the patient susceptible to fatal opportunistic diseases
and infections.
   AIDS is spread mostly through homosexual contact and from
needles shared by drug abusers. It also can be spread through
infected blood transfusions and from a birthing mother to her child.
   According to figures released Monday by the Centers for Disease
Control, AIDS has been diagnosed in 64,506 Americans, of whom more
than half, or 36,255, have died. No one is known to have recovered
from AIDS.

   AIDS Patient's Cells Found to Contain
   Monkey Virus Never Seen in Humans

   Researchers in Houston said they discovered that cancer
cells from an AIDS patient contained a monkey virus never
before seen in humans.
   How the patient contracted a monkey-virus infection and
whether it had anything to do with either his AIDS or his
cancer is a mystery. But the case is expected to create a
major stir among virus researchers, as well as among
scientists studying AIDS and cancer in both humans and
monkeys.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said the Houston finding may be meaningless.
Nevertheless, the Houston researchers concluded that "an
important issue" is whether the presence of the monkey virus
in the Houston patient "is an isolated phenomenon or the
harbinger of other co-infections of this type." They
suggested healthy persons as well as AIDS patients be
screened to see if the viruses "have actually entered the
human population in large numbers."
   Some preliminary tests of intravenous drug abusers and of
monkey handlers in Houston already are under way to see if
they might have been infected by the virus. One of the
Houston scientists predicted that researchers will look for
possible links between the monkey virus and other human
diseases such as cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome, where
some think a mysterious virus may be at work.
   Focusing interest on the Houston case is the nature of the
monkey virus. It belongs to a group known as a Type D
retroviruses, referring to the way the viruses infect cells.
In monkeys these viruses can cause a variety of
sometimes-fatal diseases, some of which suppress the immune
system. An AIDS-like disease in monkeys, called simian
immunodeficiency syndrome, is caused by a retrovirus but of a
different variety than Type D.
   Until now only four retroviruses have been found that
infect humans. Two of these, types one and two human
immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), cause AIDS. The other two are
much rarer but are known to cause either a rare leukemia or a
paralytic disorder seen in the tropics. The latter two
viruses are known as human T-cell lymphotrophic viruses, or
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.
   The monkey-virus discovery is described in the November
issue of the Journal of Virology by molecular pathologist
Richard J. Ford of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, virologist Lawrence A. Donehower of Baylor
College of Medicine and Robert C. Bohannon, a doctoral
candidate working with Drs. Ford and Donehower. (Mr. Bohannon
also is a principal in a small Houston company, Onasco
Biotechnologies Inc., which makes diagnostic tests, including
a new test for the monkey virus.)
   The virus was in tumor cells from a 32-year-old man who
was diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
and B-cell lymphoma, a malignancy of certain white blood
cells. "The patient just sort of appeared one day with
classic AIDS," Dr. Ford recalled. There is no question that
the man was infected with HIV, the known cause of AIDS.
   However, Dr. Ford said, "there was something strange about
the lymphoma; it looked different" from the malignant
lymphoma cells pathologists usually see in AIDS patients. The
cancer cells contained the AIDS virus, but they also
contained other viral particles "that looked subtly
different" under the electron microscope, the pathologist
said.
   A series of tests, including a breakdown of the molecules
that comprised the virus's genetic core, showed the virus to
be a Type D retrovirus known as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus,
named after the Pfizer Inc. scientist who discovered it years
ago. To rule out possible laboratory contamination of the
lymphoma cells, the researcher checked biopsies of the
patient taken at another hospital and found the virus there
also.
   "As far as can be determined, our patient hadn't any
contact with monkeys," the scientists reported. They
speculated he might have picked up the monkey virus along
with the AIDS virus. Alternatively, they speculated, the
monkey virus might have been present but latent until the man
was infected by the AIDS virus.
   "It is tempting to speculate" that concurrent infection by
the AIDS and monkey viruses "may have resulted in an
accelerated progression of immune deficiency, but no evidence
exists to confirm this," they wrote.
   The Houston researchers wrote they expected their report
"will be received with some skepticism" and that infections
of other humans by the monkey virus will have to be confirmed
to verify their findings.
   Other researchers said they were, indeed, skeptical of the
findings and saw little public health concern, even if the
Houston discovery was confirmed. Scientists and technicians
working on the simian version of AIDS at Emory University's
Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta are regularly
tested, and none has ever been found infected by the monkey
retroviruses, said associate director Harold McClure.
   There was some concern years ago about the Type D
retroviruses leaping from monkeys to humans, but no evidence
was ever found of such human infection, noted veterinarian
William Morton at the University of Washington Primate Center
in Seattle. The worries at the time, however, raised all
kinds of problems about whether people should be tested for
the monkey virus and what it would mean if the test was
positive, he noted. The new report, he said, might well
"uncork that whole area of concern again," Dr. Morton said.

   Soldiers Back From Gulf War May Carry
   Exotic Diseases, U.S. Doctors Are Told

   U.S. doctors were warned to watch for exotic diseases in
troops returning from the Middle East, particularly
reservists who have returned to civilian life.
   Although most returning soldiers are expected to be
healthy, a few could be infected with viruses and bacteria
unfamiliar to U.S. physicians, four military doctors warned
in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. These exotic
microbes can produce illnesses ranging from simple diarrhea
caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria to a fatal contagious
disease known as Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most returning sick soldiers probably will be treated by
military doctors, the doctors noted. But, "Some will return
to their civilian communities with diseases that only become
evident after their homecoming, sometimes after months or
years, and others will pose a risk of secondary transmission
to people with whom they come in contact," the specialists
from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Institute of
Research in Washington wrote.
   The half million American troops that have been in the
Middle East since August "have encountered a variety of
infectious disease endemic to the area," warned Lt. Col.
Robert A. Gasser of the Air Force and Army doctors Maj. Alan
J. Magill, Col. Charles N. Oster and Col. Edmund C. Tramont.
   The troops' biggest medical problem has been
gastrointestinal illnesses, as is normal for armies in the
field. "Incidence rates have been as high as 50 cases per
1,000 American troops per week in Saudi Arabia," the
specialists said. Viruses are common causes of these
illnesses, characterized by diarrhea and dysentery.
   "Standard treatment regimens remain effective for all
these infections with the notable exception of those caused
by bacteria," the doctors said. "Apparently, years of
indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the Middle East have
selected bacterial populations with extremely high rates of
resistance to multiple antibiotics," the doctors explained.
The diarrhea-causing bacteria are resistant to such common
antibiotics as tetracycline, ampicillin,
trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol.
   Few U.S. troops have contracted any of the other exotic,
Middle East diseases, Dr. Magill said in an interview. "There
have been a couple of cases of visceral leishmaniasis, but
the patients are doing well," he said. This disease, also
called kala-azar and dum-dum fever, is caused by a protozoa
that invades the bloodstream. Fever, weight loss, lassitude,
and enlarged spleens, livers and lymph glands are symptoms.
   "With an incubation period that may exceed 2 1/2 years,
visceral leishmaniasis should remain in the differential
diagnosis of sick veterans and travelers for years to come,"
the four specialists said.
   Dr. Magill said military doctors currently are watching
the U.S. troops for sandfly fever, a viral illness carried by
sandflies in the region. "When the troops got there last
August it was the tail end of the sandfly season" and thus
there were only a "couple of clusters" of the disease then.
The sandflies, however, are now coming out again and will be
flitting around in full force by the end of April, he said.
   The acute sandfly fever, itself, lasts only a few days and
dies away on its own. "Convalescence, however, is frequently
complicated by depression, fatigue, and weakness that can
last for months," they said. Thus, doctors finding returning
veterans with what seems like chronic fatigue syndrome or
post-traumatic stress syndrome should use blood tests to rule
out sandfly fever, the doctors said.
   One of the more worrisome diseases that haunt the U.S.
troops is Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, the specialists
indicated. The virus that causes it is carried by ticks and
is widespread in the Middle East. Fortunately, the virus
usually fails to produce any overt or troublesome symptoms in
most people that it infects. In rare instances, however,
fulminant disease breaks out with sudden fever, headache,
back and limb pain and severe prostration followed by
diarrhea and vomiting.
   "We feel that the soldiers returning from Saudi Arabia
will be extremely unlikely to bring Congo-Crimean fever into
the U.S.," Dr. Magill said. But, he explained, it is
extremely important that doctors immediately recognize a case
should one occur in a returning veteran. There have been
cases where the disease has spread to hospital personnel from
a patient in the fulminant throes of the fever. In such
hospital outbreaks in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and
Iraq, 40% to 100% of the infected hospital workers have died
of the fever.
   Military medics also are on the alert for typhus, which is
spread by lice. "Iraqi prisoners of war taken in January were
described as being heavily infested with lice," the doctors
noted.

<HEAD>Study Boosts Argument for AZT Treatment of Symptom-Free AIDS
Infections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study shows that some AIDS-infected
people without symptoms may be helped by the drug AZT even if
certain key immune cells appear normal.
   The findings by scientists at the University of California, Los
Angeles, will be published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
   People who are infected by the AIDS virus but have no outward
symptoms often display reduced levels of certain immune system
white blood cells known as T-cells.
   Doctors generally determine how badly the AIDS virus has hurt
the body's disease-fighting immune system by measuring T-cells.
That's because T-cells activate many parts of the body's defense
system, including other white blood cells called monocytes and
macrophages.
   Macrophages are grown-up versions of monocytes. Both types of
cells are found in various body tissues, where they act as
scavengers that gobble up debris and invading microbes to help
combat disease.
   A low T-cell count often is the justification used by doctors in
deciding whether the antiviral drug AZT should be prescribed for
AIDS-infected people who haven't yet developed overt symptoms.
   The new study found that, in the test tube, the virus can
directly cause defects in monocytes and macrophages regardless of
whether T-cells are damaged or not, said Dr. David Golde, chief of
blood diseases and cancer at UCLA.
   The researchers also showed that AZT significantly reduced the
AIDS-induced damage to macrophages and monocytes.
   Both findings suggest AIDS-infected people might benefit from
AZT therapy even if their T-cell levels are not abnormally low,
Golde said.
   But he emphasized that he wasn't advocating AZT treatment for
all AIDS-infected people with normal T-cell levels, only those who
are tested and found to have damaged macrophages.
   The study was conducted in Golde's laboratory by research
biologist Gayle Cocita Baldwin, Golde and others.
   AZT has been used for three years to treat patients severely ill
with AIDS symptoms.
   In March, the Food and Drug Administration recommended that
adults infected with the deadly virus be treated with AZT even if
they do not yet have symptoms of the disease. The recommendation
stemmed from federally sponsored studies showing that AZT slowed
the progression of AIDS in infected patients with early symptoms or
without any symptoms.
   But the recommendation also was based on the work of a
scientific advisory panel that said AZT should be used only on
symptom-free patients with reduced T-cell counts.
   The new study suggests the drug might help even AIDS-infected
people with normal T-cell counts.
   Researchers have known for some time that monocytes and
macrophages are defective in people infected by the AIDS virus.
   But they didn't know if the virus directly attacked macrophages
and monocytes to make them defective, or if they were defective
simply as a secondary result of the viral attack on T-cells, Golde
said.
   To perform the study, Baldwin and her colleagues took monocytes
from human blood, infected them with the AIDS virus, then let them
grow into macrophages. They found the infected macrophages were
defective in their disease-fighting ability.
   ``What we found is that in pure cultures of monocytes and
macrophages, the AIDS virus itself causes the function of these
cells to be defective,'' Golde said.
   Certain strains of the AIDS virus are more likely to damage
monocytes and macrophages, while other strains seem to attack
mainly the T-cells, Golde said.
   ``It may be that certain patients are infected with strains that
would have their major impact on macrophages and monocytes, and in
those patients antiviral therapy would appear to be useful'' even
if T-cell counts weren't dramatically reduced, he added.

   Highly successful trials of the antiviral drug
AZT suggest that AIDS may soon become ``a treatable disease''
instead of a hopeless infection, federal officials say.
   The announcement is ``a major turning point in the AIDS
epidemic,'' said Jean McGuire, director of the AIDS Action Council,
an advocacy group for AIDS patients.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announced
Thursday that trials of AZT on one group of patients who have the
AIDS virus, but no symptoms, proved that the drug can halt
progression of the infection.
   ``We are indeed entering the period when AIDS may become a
treatable disease,'' Sullivan said at a news conference where the
AZT drug trial results were announced.
   However, he cautioned: ``AZT is not a cure and, indeed, even
those who are under AZT treatment remain capable of transmitting the
disease.''
   Findings of the drug trials on early-infected patients who show
no symptoms prompted federal officials to stop the trials so that
all participants can receive AZT. The drug trial had required
one-third of the 1,300 in the study to receive a placebo, or sugar
pill.
   Patients in the trial were in the early stages of infection by
the human immunedeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS.
   In effect, they were feeling well and were symptom-free, but they
had a damaged immune system as measured by the numbers of T4
lymphocytes, a type of immune cells, in the blood. An AZT trial
continues for patients in an even earlier stage of infection and
with even less immune system damage.
   AZT, also known as zidovudine, is marketed by Burroughs Wellcome
Co. under the brand name Retrovir. It formally was known by the name
azidothymidine, which was shortened in popular use to AZT.
   Thursday's announcement marks the third time that formal trials
of AZT have been modified after the drug demonstrated its
effectiveness against AIDS in selected patient groups.
   Two weeks ago, a trial was stopped among patients with a stage of
the disease called AIDS-related complex, or ARC. Earlier, the
government halted trials among profoundly infected AIDS patients. In
both cases the trials were stopped so that those participants
getting placebo could start receiving the drug.
   An AZT trial continues among AIDS patients whose blood immune
system is still healthy but who test positive for infection by the
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. This group
would be at an even earlier stage of the disease.
   Sullivan said the new trial results, along with those from the
two earlier trials, provide ``real hope for the millions of people
worldwide who are infected with HIV.''
   Ms. McGuire said in a prepared statement, ``For the millions of
Americans who have waited to be tested for HIV because there was no
medical assistance available, today's announcement should be reason
for people to rethink that decision.''
   The HHS secretary said he is ordering that Medicare patients
receiving AZT be reimbursed for the cost of the drug. AZT, which
must be taken six times daily, costs $7,000 to $8,000 a year per
patient.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, the lead federal clinical agency in
fighting AIDS, said that with Thursday's announcement about 400,000
more patients may be prescribed AZT. Even though the drug is not
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use among mildly
infected patients, it could be prescribed for such patients at
doctors' discretion, he said.
   The earlier trials opened use of the drug to about 200,000
patients, making a total of 600,000 who may now take AZT, Fauci said.
   Sullivan said the FDA will consider the new drug trial results
and may modify the approved uses of AZT to include those mildly
infected. This action, however, could take months, he said.
   In the study concluded Thursday, one-third of the patients
received 1,500 milligrams daily of AZT, a third took 500 mg daily
and a third got sugar pills. The study was conducted at 32 centers
in 16 states and the District of Columbia.
   Fauci said the results showed that among those taking the
placebo, 38 patients developed symptoms of AIDS or of ARC. Among
those on high doses of AZT, 19 developed the disease symptoms, and
among those on the low doses, 17 developed symptoms.
   ``This is a very important step in the scientific certification
of what we had been hoping for,'' Fauci said. ``We're not talking
about a cure, but we're talking about a very important step in
delaying the progression of the disease.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system and renders it incapable of protecting against infection. The
disease is caused by the HIV virus and is spread most frequently
through sexual contact, the sharing of needles and syringes, and
from mother to newborn infant.
   New figures released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control
show there have been 102,621 cases of AIDS diagnosed in the United
States since 1981. A total of 59,391 U.S. patients have died.
   There is no cure for AIDS and no one is known to have recovered
completely from the viral infection.

<TEXT>
   Eight months into a study of chronic fatigue
syndrome, doctors in four cities have reported 250 possible cases
of the mysterious malady to the Centers for Disease Control.
   About 350 physicians in Atlanta; Reno, Nev.; Grand Rapids,
Mich.; and Wichita, Kan., are cooperating with the CDC, reporting
possible cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, sometimes termed the
``yuppie disease.''
   The study, which began in September, has yielded 250 cases, said
Dr. Walter Gunn of the Atlanta-based CDC. It will be another year
before preliminary results from the study are available, he said
today.
   The CDC is trying ``to determine the prevalence and incidence of
this illness,'' Gunn said. ``Some people think it's increasing, but
we really don't know yet.''
   In the last two months, the CDC has received about 2,000 calls
seeking information on chronic fatigue syndrome, ``mostly from
people who think they have it, or know somebody who has it,'' Gunn
said.
   Symptoms of the illness, first named in 1988 but described in
medical literature back to the 1700s, include the debilitating
fatigue which gives it its name, as well as fever, sore throat,
muscle weakness and discomfort, headaches and insomnia.
   Studies have suggested anger or depression may be implicated in
chronic fatigue syndrome, but there's no suggestion it is an
imaginary ailment.
   ``It definitely exists,'' Gunn said. ``We are finding people who
meet the case definition.''
   The study involves reporting of cases to the CDC by private
doctors. Those physicians do not refer their patients to the CDC,
and the centers are not seeking case reports from the public.

   AIDS has spawned a new kind of hypochondriac:
people convinced they are infected by the AIDS virus despite
medical evidence to the contrary, a psychologist who has treated
such people said Sunday.
   Even monthly blood tests for up to a year have failed to quell
the fear in some of them, said Miami psychologist Larry Harmon. In
many cases, the fear stems from guilt over a past sexual incident.
   ``These people are terrified,'' and their condition can make
them avoid sex with their spouses for fear of infecting them, and
disrupt their concentration at work, Harmon said.
   One of his patients was afraid to hold his newborn baby for fear
of infecting the child, he said in an interview.
   Harmon discussed treatment of people with ``AFRAIDS,'' which
stands for acute fear regarding AIDS, at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association.
   When anxiety and depression causes such symptoms as weight loss,
fatigue or reduced resistance to disease, afflicted people
interpret the symptoms as signs of AIDS, he said.
   Even a bruise from a bumped elbow may be perceived as the mark
of an AIDS-related cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma, he said.
   He said he has treated 10 patients since seeing his first case
two years ago, and other psychologists have told him they are
seeing it too. But he did not have any figures on how many cases
might exist.
   The problem often is rooted in guilt over an extramarital
affair, a visit to a prostitute or a homosexual experience, he
said. Sometimes the experience occurred years before.
   Sex with an infected person can spread the AIDS virus.
   One man Harmon treated, married for 10 years, had had sex wih a
female neighbor. About a month later he heard his minister describe
AIDS as punishment for sins, and about a week after that he noticed
he had lost weight and suffered diarrhea. Both were due to anxiety,
but the man interpreted them as evidence of AIDS, Harmon said.
   His worry persisted after a blood test proved negative, and he
was referred to Harmon by an AIDS hot line.
   Most people can significantly reduce their anxiety with
treatment, he said. Therapists can explain the facts about acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, and explain how people who are worried
tend to become over-concerned by coughs or other ``symptoms'' most
people would ignore.
   Harmon asks his patients to carry copies of negative blood test
results in their wallets. He also teaches them about reducing
anxiety by focusing on their present lives and what is going on
around them, and dealing with guilt.
   Harmon said people who recognize the problem in themselves or
others should contact an AIDS hot line for the name of a
psychologist familiar with AIDS-related issues.

   The AIDS virus disappeared from the bloodstreams of
10 patients with AIDS or a related disease when they got monthly
transfusions of blood plasma from otherwise healthy carriers of the
virus, researchers said today.
   The researchers said the treatment apparently kills the virus
without causing serious side effects.
   ``It doesn't mean that they don't have any more virus in their
bodies,'' said Dr. Abraham Karpas of the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology, affiliated with Cambridge University. ``But there is no
more free virus in the blood to infect their cells.''
   The plasma, treated to remove viruses, contains high levels of
antibodies that can kill the AIDS virus, Karpas said.
   AIDS patients lack such antibodies in their blood, said Karpas,
who led the research team. Research details appear in December's
issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a U.S.
scientific journal, he said.
   Karpas called the results of his study ``very encouraging,'' but
other AIDS researchers urged caution in interpreting them.
   Dr Bryan Gazzard of St. Stephen's Hospital in London, where the
tests were conducted, said the findings were interesting but that
larger trials must be done before anyone could say the treatment
offered any clinical benefit.
   Dr. James Chin, an epidemiologist with the Geneva-based World
Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS, said, ``If it's for
real, (it) deserves to be further evaluated.''
   However, ``I think that there may be a lot of work between some
experimental results like that and what kind of applicability you
would have in the real world,'' he warned in an interview.
   ``We don't know how effective it would be, how long people would
have to take such a product. It could very well be for life. So a
lot of things have to be worked out before we can really offer
people a real ray of hope,'' he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, breaking down its resistance to infection. No cure has been
discovered. Not everyone infected with the AIDS virus goes on to
develop symptoms.
   In trials over the past nine months on six AIDS patients and four
suffering from an early stage of AIDS known as AIDS-related complex,
the virus in the patients' blood ``immediately disappeared ...
following the transfusion of this hyper-immune plasma,'' Karpas said
in an interview.
   The researchers said nine of the 10 patients are still alive,
reasonably well, and out of hospital nine months later. ``Those
patients have remained virus negative now for nine months,'' Karpas
said.
   Karpas said some of patients in the study with early symptoms of
AIDS began producing their own antibodies when injected with the
antibody-rich plasma.
   ``The explanation could be that the neutralizing antibody stopped
the virus infecting more T-cells,'' he said.
   T-cells, which are destroyed by the AIDS virus, are a type of
blood cell essential to the body's immune defenses.
   Karpas said he believes the method could reverse the course of
AIDS in some patients, or ``at least to keep it at bay.''
   He hopes to conduct further tests, comparing the effectiveness of
his treatment with the drug azidothymidine, or AZT, which has been
shown to prolong the lives of AIDS sufferers.
   AZT's drawback is that it is toxic to bone marrow,and causes
anemia.
   But the experimental method, said Karpas, ``is not a drug. It has
no toxic effect whatsoever. It's human plasma. It's like a
transfusion.''
   Karpas said larger-scale tests need to be done, but he said he
saw no reason why the treatment couldn't be made available
immediately.

<HEAD>Tentative Link Found Between New Herpes Virus, Cancer, Biologist
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biologist said Wednesday that a newly
discovered herpes virus spread by casual contact might be a sixth
cancer-causing virus and appears to work with the AIDS virus in
wiping out the immune system of AIDS victims.
   Robert Gallo, the National Cancer Institute's chief of
tumor-cell biology, said more evidence was needed before the highly
contagious Herpes 6, or human B-lymphocyte virus, could be blamed
for causing certain types of cancers.
   Gallo spoke at the annual meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, which convened here Sunday.
   Researchers have found a high prevalence of antibodies to the
Herpes 6 virus in people with Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood acute leukemia,
Gallo said.
   ``One could argue the virus must be playing a role to be
detected so readily in those tumors,'' Gallo said.
   Currently, five other viruses are believed to cause cancer. They
are hepatitis B, which can cause liver cancer; Epstein-Barr, which
can cause nasopharyngeal cancer; HTLV, which can cause leukemia;
papillomavirus, which may cause cervical cancer; and
cytomegalovirus, linked to prostate cancer.
   The Herpes 6 virus also has been found alongside the AIDS virus
in T-4 cells, which mastermind the immune system and are the prime
target of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Gallo said.
   Since the AIDS virus kills only a small percentage of T-4 cells
at a time, Gallo said, the new herpes virus might explain the total
annihilation of T-4 cells in AIDS patients.
   Tests to detect Herpes 6 have differed widely on its prevalence
in the United States. One test indicated that it is carried by
between 5 percent and 30 percent of the population; another
indicated between 70 percent and 90 percent.

<HEAD>Study: AIDS Carriers Show No Mental Problems Until Symptoms

   People infected with the AIDS virus
show no sign of mental problems until they develop physical
symptoms associated with the deadly disease, a U.S. government
study shows.
   ``We're not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a
number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually
any form of brain damage,'' said one of the study's authors, Dr.
Ola Selnes, a psychologist at the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions in Baltimore.
   He presented the findings Wednesday at the Fourth International
Conference on AIDS.
   Also at the meeting, Dr. Jonas Salk, the polio vaccine pioneer,
described his first efforts toward an AIDS vaccine.
   In a separate report, Dr. Daniel Zagury, the daring French
scientist who in 1986 injected himself with an experimental AIDS
vaccine of his own devising, said that with booster shots he has
developed antibodies that might be capable of destroying the AIDS
virus.
   And in a study of the distribution of clean needles and syringes
to drug addicts in Amsterdam, researchers said they found that such
a program does not encourage drug abuse and may well reduce the
transmission of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.
   The study by Selnes and Dr. Justin McArthur, also of Hopkins,
was intended to resolve questions raised by earlier studies that
had found distinct mental problems, such as loss of memory and
mental slowness, in people infected with the AIDS virus. Those
changes sometimes seemed to appear before any other signs of AIDS
infection.
   As a result, concern was expressed that people in sensitive
jobs, such as airline pilots, nuclear reactor operators or
operators of heavy industrial equipment, should be removed from
their positions if they become infected with the AIDS virus, even
if they are not outwardly sick.
   ``Based on our results, we do not feel there is any cause for
alarm or concern,'' Selnes said. The study was sponsored by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   The debate involves whether mental problems appear early in the
course of infection, before other diseases strike. There is general
agreement that about 70 percent of those who die of AIDS have
significant mental and neurological problems after other symptoms
develop, according to a report released in March by the World
Health Organization.
   That report concluded that there was no evidence for mental or
neurological problems in otherwise healthy people infected with the
AIDS virus.
   Selnes and McArthur followed 201 people for two years.
Eighty-two were uninfected with the AIDS virus, 88 had been
infected for a long time and 31 had been infected for a relatively
brief period.
   The patients were examined every six months with a variety of
psychological tests, and no differences were seen between the
infected and uninfected subjects, Selnes said.
   Salk said in a report on his vaccine research that he has
completed the first human trials of an unusual vaccine intended to
keep infected people from developing AIDS.
   He said he had given the vaccine to nine men with ARC, or
AIDS-related complex, an AIDS-like disease that can progress to
AIDS.
   The vaccine appears safe, he said. It also appears to raise
levels of immune system cells, and in one of the subjects the virus
seemed to disappear completely.
   That has persuaded Salk to continue trials with 54 AIDS-infected
people who have not yet developed AIDS or ARC.
   In a separate report, Zagury, a University of Paris scientist,
said his administration of an experimental vaccine to himself in
1986 had enhanced his body's production of antibodies against the
AIDS virus.
   The vaccine consisted of a specially modified smallpox virus
containing a portion of the AIDS virus. He gave himself booster
shots of his own blood cells, which he had extracted and infected
with the same type of modified virus before reinjecting them.
   He said his body has produced high levels of AIDS antibodies,
some of which may be capable of neutralizing the AIDS virus.
   Ernest Buning, a psychologist with the Amsterdam Municipal
Health Service, said that four years of providing clean syringes
and needles to drug addicts in the Dutch city has produced a
significant drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb AIDS
spread.
   The needle exchange program gave health workers an opportunity
to tell addicts how to lower their AIDS risk, and that counselling
was a critical component of the exchange program, said Buning.
   ``Our conclusion is that the needle and syringe exchange helps
addicts to use drugs safely,'' he said. Furthermore, he said, the
program did not lead to increased drug use, as critics of such
programs had feared.
   The first U.S. needle exchange program will begin soon in
Portland, Ore., under the sponsorship of the American Foundation
for AIDS Research.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American researcher said Monday
she is investigating whether hypnosis can help people with AIDS
strengthen their immune systems, which the virus that produces the
deadly disease destroys.
   Karen Olness, professor of pediatrics at the Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, said she is ``very optimistic''
that hypnosis eventually may play a role in battling acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   AIDS undermines the body's disease-fighting immune system,
rendering it vulnerable to various infections and forms of cancer.
Ms. Olness said she is trying to find out whether some infections
can be prevented or slowed.
   Hypnosis has been found effective in the treatment of less
serious immune-related illnesses, such as warts, Ms. Olness told
The Associated Press in an interview.
   She was attending the 11th International Congress on Hypnosis
and Psychosomatic Medicine, a gathering of more than 600 medical
and psychiatric experts.
   ``We are trying to find out which immune changes a human being
can voluntarily affect'' under the influence of hypnosis, she said.
   Ms. Olness added that she had recently began an experiment
involving about 50 hemophiliac children infected with the humane
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. Hemophiliacs are
a major risk group for AIDS, which they contract through infected
blood transfusions.
   Part of the group is being taught self-hypnosis techniques to
see if they develop more antibodies against disease than the other
children, Ms. Olness said.
   The patients, all aged 5 to 12, are shown a puppet show that
explains the basics of the immune system.
   They then are hypnotized and given the suggestion that they can
voluntarily increase production of certain antibodies, shesaid, and
in later stages of the experiment they should be able to invoke the
hypnotic state themselves.
   Her experiment's purpose is to boost boosting the function of
T-cell lymphocytes, immune system cells that can help fight off
AIDS infection.
   Mrs. Olness said her work was in line with a recent experiment
in which a group of children showed significant increases of
immunoglobulins _ immune system proteins _ in their saliva after
undergoing hypnotic treatment.
   ``They were effectively increasing their antibodies'' just by
being told to do so under hypnosis, she said. The experiment
involved was conducted two years ago at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis, Minn., according to Ms. Olness.
   A hypnotized person is made to concentrate on a particular image
and enters an altered state of consciousness similiar to sleep.
While that condition lasts, the patient is highly susceptible to
suggestions that would otherwise seem strange or unacceptable.
   Conversely, the immune system can be severely weakened by
adverse factors such as stress, Ms. Olness said, adding that little
is known about the exact relationship between a person's emotional
state and the body's resistance to disease.
   She acknowledged that the experiment, scheduled to last for two
years, may be too short for lasting conclusions. Not all HIV
carriers ultimately develop AIDS, and it may take several years for
symptoms to appear in those who do.
   Use of hypnosis in fighting immune-related disease is among the
most recent applications of the practice, which became popular in
the late 18th century through the work of the Austrian physician
Franz Mesmer.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   COMBINATION therapy for AIDS is gaining ground.
   At the Seventh International Conference on AIDS in
Florence, Italy, Ann C. Collier of the University of
Washington gave the first public report on a study that
combined the drugs AZT and DDI. A mixed group of AIDS
patients and people infected by the HIV virus that causes
AIDS got varying doses of the combined regimen or AZT alone.
   Though the report was preliminary, she said patients
receiving the combo had a rise in the levels of T4 immune
cells. When the AZT portion of the regimen was high (600 mg),
the improved cell counts lasted longer.
   Although it's too soon to predict whether this regimen,
like a recently reported AZT-DDC treatment, will prove
beneficial to patients, Dr. Collier said she believes people
treated with the combination are getting "similar if not
better" results than those who take AZT alone.
   Such findings are encouraging, but they aren't expected to
influence hearings later this month before an advisory panel
of the Food and Drug Administration, where DDI's maker,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, will press its case for market
approval.
                                                                                                       

   Tests of New Treatments
   Focus More on T4 Levels
                                                                                                       

   HOW TO MEASURE the effectiveness of AIDS drugs continues
to spur debate.
   The FDA is considering whether to accept a new measure of
drug efficacy, the level of T4 cells in the blood. Drugs now
are judged, in part, by how long it takes patients to die, a
standard AIDS advocates say is cruel and prolongs studies
unnecessarily.
   Margaret Fischl of the University of Miami reported that
among infected people who were given early treatment, a rise
in T4 cells presages a longer stretch of disease-free living.
"This suggests T4 cell levels may be a useful predictor in
clinical trials," she said, though she granted it isn't "a
perfect marker."
   Similarly, Robert Yarchoan of the National Cancer
Institute said T4 levels that drop below 50 indicate a danger
zone where most AIDS-linked infections and deaths occur.
Although many clinics stop monitoring such levels after they
fall to 200 from the normal 1,000 or more, the NCI is urging
doctors to continue monitoring -- especially near the 50
level.
                                                                                                       

   Virus's Ability to Resist
   New Drugs Is Disputed
                                                                                                       

   THE HIV virus's ability to mutate and evade attack by the
drug AZT has led researchers to wonder whether the virus also
will grow resistant over time to the experimental compounds
DDC and DDI.
   Richard Reichman and his co-workers at the University of
Rochester presented data suggesting DDI-resistant viruses are
starting to appear. They said six of 14 patients receiving
DDI for one year showed evidence that the virus lost
sensitivity to the drug and began replicating again after
about six months of treatment.
   However, a contradictory study by Takuma Shirasaka and his
colleagues at the National Cancer Institute said HIV remains
vulnerable to both DDI and DDC even after it has grown
resistant to treatment by AZT.
   "I'm still awaiting compelling evidence on DDC and DDI
resistance," said Douglas Richman of the University of
California at San Diego, who first documented drug resistance
in AIDS. He added: "Resistance clearly develops much more
slowly to DDC and DDI than to AZT."
                                                                                                       

   Some AIDS Lymphomas
   Are Deadlier Than Others
                                                                                                       

   LYMPHOMA, a cancer of the lymph system, increasingly
attacks long-term AIDS patients. Often these cancers are
aggressive and swiftly fatal.
   Now Lawrence Kaplan of the University of California at San
Francisco has performed a molecular analysis on such tumors
and found that variations within cells can help doctors
predict how long a patient will survive.
   Dr. Kaplan found that some of the tumors contained
Epstein-Barr virus, which is responsible for mononucleosis
and is linked in Africa with a particular tumor called
Burkitt's lymphoma. Patients who had the virus embedded in
their lymphoma cells died sooner, he found.
   Further, Dr. Kaplan said tumors that were monoclonal,
arising from a single malignant cell, indicated poor
survival. But polyclonal tumors arising from several cells
were linked with somewhat better survival.
   Future studies may help determine how such lymphomas arise
and whether different therapies can be devised for them.
                                                                                                       

   Enlisting an `Antisense'
   Against Kaposi's Tumors
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER AIDS-linked tumor, Kaposi's sarcoma, may be a
candidate for genetic therapy, according to Otoniel
Martinez-Maza of the University of California at Los Angeles.
   Dr. Martinez-Maza said KS, a cancer of tiny capillaries in
the skin, depends on a cascade of growth factors to fuel its
malignant proliferation. Among the growth factors is
interleukin-6, which is released by the KS cell and then
returns to that same cell to fuel its further growth in a
vicious feedback loop.
   But the scientist said he's investigating a type of weapon
known as an "antisense," a strand of genetic material that
blocks the gene responsible for IL-6. He said IL-6 antisense
"dramatically decreased the rate of production" of IL-6 in
lab tests and inhibited KS growth.
