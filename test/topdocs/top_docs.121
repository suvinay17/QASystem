<LEADPARA>  Emmy Award-winning actor-comedian Danny Thomas, star of the popular television
series "Make Room for Daddy" and benefactor of St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital, died early today. He was 79.;    Thomas was pronounced dead at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center about a half-hour after he suffered a heart attack
at his Beverly Hills home, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COMEDIAN DANNY THOMAS DIES AT 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Thomas made a guest appearance on Saturday's episode of the series "Empty
Nest" as an aging physician. He recently completed a tour promoting his new
book, "Make Room for Danny," said Norman Brokaw, chairman and chief executive
officer of the William Morris Agency.;    "It's hard to believe. He really
wasn't sick," said Brokaw, Thomas' longtime agent.;    "Make Room for Daddy,"
renamed "The Danny Thomas Show" after its first three seasons, was one of the
longest-running family comedies, running from 1953 to 1964. Thomas played a
nightclub singer and comedian, Danny Williams.;    Jean Hagen played his first
wife, Margaret, followed by Marjorie Lord as his second wife, Kathy; Angela
Cartwright played Kathy's daughter, Linda; and Rusty Hamer played his son,
Rusty. Sherry Jackson and Penny Parker played his daughter, Terry.;    The
title came from a phrase used in the real Thomas household. Whenever Thomas
returned home from a tour as a nightclub and radio comedian, his children had
to shift bedrooms to "make room for Daddy.";    Thomas founded St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., in 1962 and regularly made
appearances on behalf of the hospital. It is a leading research center
dedicated to finding cures for children's cancer and other catastrophic
children's diseases.;    President Reagan presented the Congressional Gold
Medal to Thomas in recognition of his fund-raising activities to benefit St.
Jude's.;    Longtime friend Milton Berle said Thomas had pushed himself in
recent months promoting his book and appearing at fund-raisers. "I don't know
what the wear and tear was on his body but he was so dedicated to St. Jude and
the children he raised millions and millions of dollars for," Berle said.
"He's been driving himself very hard.";    When Thomas was a struggling
entertainer, he had prayed to St. Jude, patron saint of hopeless cases. He
vowed then that some day he would build a shrine to the saint.;    Born Amos
Jacobs in Deerfield, Mich., the comedian grew up in a large Lebanese Catholic
family in Toledo, Ohio. After a number of odd jobs, he moved to Chicago with
the aim of becoming a radio actor.;    He was making a good living as a radio
actor when he married Rose Marie Cassaniti in 1936. Their lives changed when
Jacobs took a $50-a-week job as emcee at Chicago's 5100 Club. He stayed three
years and adopted a new name from brothers Danny and Thomas. He moved on to
the prestigious Chez Paree in Chicago, then national fame.;    Another turning
point in Thomas' career came after his success in nightclubs and radio. Movie
studios wanted to sign him, but there was one problem, as Thomas remembered:; 
  "Louis B. Mayer said I had the qualities to become a great dramatic actor.; 
  "Then Mayer told me how Americans go to the movies to live in a dream world,
leaving their own humdrum lives behind. They wanted to see beautiful people
with perfect faces. So he wanted me to have my nose fixed.;    "Afterward my
agent, Abe Lastfogel of William Morris, said, 'You don't have to change your
nose. There'll be plenty of work for you anyway.' ";    Lastfogel was right.
Thomas starred at MGM and Warner Bros., then moved smoothly into television.; 
  He is survived by his wife, Rose Marie; daughters Marlo Thomas, actress wife
of talk show host Phil Donahue, and Theresa; and son, Tony.  </TEXT>

ANN CONWAY: STARS TWINKLED ON MAN OF THE YEAR

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So many superstars, so little time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tall cotton, isn't it?" said John Crean on Saturday night, ogling the 
galaxy of luminaries crammed into the ballroom of the Century Plaza Hotel in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On view at the bash, which raised more than $1 million for St. Jude Children's 
Research Hospital in Memphis: Danny Thomas, Bob Hope, George Burns, Milton 
Berle, Steve Allen, Buddy Ebsen, Red Buttons, Carol Channing, Bea Arthur, Cyd 
Charisse, Tony Martin, Virginia Mayo, Cesar Romero and more. So many more. 
</P>
<P>
But -- are you ready for this? -- the stars were there to ogle Crean, the 
second Orange County resident in as many years to receive the St. Jude Man of 
the Year Award from Danny Thomas, who founded the hospital in 1962. (Car dealer 
Roger Miller received the prestigious nod last year.) 
</P>
<P>
Crean's coup had its beginnings in 1981, the year he and his wife, Donna, 
became aware of the hospital and began to support it. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year, Crean, who lives in Newport Beach, was invited by L.A. Rams 
owner Georgia Frontiere to watch a football game in her Jacuzzi-appointed suite 
at Anaheim Stadium. Danny Thomas, a buddy of Frontiere's, was also there. 
"Danny came up to me and asked me if I wanted to be St. Jude's Man of the 
Year," Crean said. "And I told him I certainly did. So here we are!" 
</P>
<P>
The award has a hefty price tag -- a $100,000 donation to the hospital. "John 
sent me his check one week after I asked him," said Thomas, beaming a megawatt 
smile at Crean during the star-studded VIP pre-event party (where George Burns 
sat in a corner smiling impishly at guests while he puffed a cigar). "Do you 
know how many people do that? Few. The money has been collecting interest for 
the hospital ever since. Crean is a wonderful guy." 
</P>
<P>
Among guests who came from Orange County to the affair (some of them in luxury 
motor coaches provided by the Creans) -- former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, home 
from his whirlwind tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first walk on 
the moon. "John is a very kind man, generous with those of all statures," 
Aldrin said. "He is most helpful to those in need." 
</P>
<P>
After settling down to a feast that included Chateaubriand and chocolate 
squares crammed with whipped cream and fresh berries, Bob Hope welcomed guests. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can't get your attention, no one can," said Danny Thomas' daughter, 
Terre, who followed Hope to the podium. (Indeed. One of the most dreaded 
challenges for gala hosts is hushing guests.) 
</P>
<P>
Tony Thomas, the comedian's son, did the presenting honors. He said of Crean: 
"His company, Fleetwood Enterprises, a Fortune 500 company, employs 10,000 
people in 17 states and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
"I accept this honor gratefully," said Crean as 1,700 guests listened in 
silence. "It is wonderful the way Rose Marie (Thomas) and Danny Thomas inspire 
others to keep their special dream alive." 
</P>
<P>
Show time. Milton Berle, Steve Allen and Danny Thomas came on stage to crack 
guests up with a show dubbed "The Living Legends of Comedy." (Sid Caesar was 
supposed to have performed, but got hung up in New York. Allen volunteered to 
replace him.) 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the madness that had guests rolling in the aisles: 
</P>
<P>
Berle to Allen: "I love your suit. You never throw anything away, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
Allen to Berle: "If I did, you'd put it in your act." 
</P>
<P>
Berle to audience: "This hotel opened in 1967 with my act!" 
</P>
<P>
Allen to Berle: "Who was doing it at the time?" 
</P>
<P>
Thomas to audience: "They say I'm religious. Bob Hope once said I was so 
religious that the California Highway Patrol stopped me for having stained 
glass windows in my car." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: Jolene and Tom Fuentes, Pilar Wayne (in scarlet silk and a 
twinkling tiara), Buck and Colleen Johns (who are busy-busy cleaning their 
Santa Ana Heights house to prepare for Vice President Dan Quayle's visit there 
Aug. 24), Carl and Margaret Karcher, Barbara and Alexander Bowie, Mardy and Art 
Svendsen, Virginia and Paul Bender, Marion and Tony Montupert, Arvella and the 
Rev. Robert Schuller, Lois and Ted Lundberg, and Vikki Vargas and Mike Nason.

   A woman who went to court to prove she's
the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams Sr. will make
her professional singing debut Sunday at a festival honoring her
late father.
   ``I'm going to do it for a tribute to my father,'' said Cathy
Deupree Adkinson, who was born in Montgomery five days after
Williams died on Jan. 1, 1953.
   As a professional singer, Mrs. Adkinson is using the name ``Jett
Williams,'' which combines the last names of her parents.
   Mrs. Adkinson plans to sing several of her father's songs at the
Hank Williams Memorial Association's annual music festival Sunday
in Evergreen, 75 miles southwest of Montgomery. She will be
accompanied by two members of his original Drifting Cowboys band.
   She was born Antha Belle Jett, the daughter of Nashville, Tenn.,
secretary Bobbie Jett, with whom Williams lived during the summer
of 1952 but never married. An Alabama judge ruled in 1987 that Mrs.
Adkinson is Williams' daughter.
   The only child from Williams' two marriages is entertainer Hank
Williams Jr.

   Danny Thomas' humanitarian work as founder
of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital here will be
recognized this week in Toledo, Ohio, where the entertainer was
raised.
   The Medical College of Ohio at Toledo will present Thomas an
honorary degree Friday during commencement ceremonies, according to
a statement Tuesday from the Memphis hospital.
   Thomas, best known for the television comedy ``Make Room For
Daddy,'' founded St. Jude in 1962 and regularly makes personal
appearances on behalf of the institution.
   The hospital is a leading biomedical research center dedicated
to finding cures for childhood cancer and other catastrophic
children's diseases.

   A prosecutor said charges won't be filed
against actor Timothy Bottoms, who was booked after a motorist told
authorities that the actor confronted him with a gun.
   ``He did have a gun, but he didn't display it in a rude, angry
or threatening manner as required,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Don Grant.
   Bottoms was booked for investigation of brandishing a gun on a
road, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor, after
the motorist told the California Highway Patrol he was confronted
by the actor on U.S. 101 on May 10.
   The decision not to file charges against ``The Last Picture
Show'' actor was made last week, Grant said.
   Bottoms had a .22-caliber pistol and ammunition in his station
wagon when it was pulled over by officers, but the weapon wasn't
loaded, Grant said.
   The actor's spokesman, Sandy Bresler, has declined comment.
   Bottoms, 37, made his film debut in 1971 in the movie ``Johnny
Got His Gun.'' His other films include ``The Paper Chase'' in 1973
and ``Invaders From Mars'' in 1986.

   Chet Atkins and his fellow guitarists
will try to pick their way to a world's record Friday when they
gather at two shopping malls to play the same song simultaneously.
   They hope to establish a record for most guitarists playing one
song together. They also are out to prove that there really are
1,352 guitar pickers in Nashville as the Lovin' Spoonful declared
in their 1966 hit record, ``Nashville Cats.''
   Nashville's guitarists will meet at Hickory Hollow and Rivergate
malls.
   Atkins will lead the guitarists at Hickory Hollow and guitarist
Harold Bradley will conduct those at Rivergate 25 miles away. There
will be a telephone hookup between the two so that each group can
be cued simultaneously.
   Atkins, known as ``Mr. Guitar,'' and Bradley will decide
Thursday on the song.
   The 1988 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records does not
list a category for most guitarists playing one song together.

   Before christening an airship,
Prince Charles took over the controls. Once on the ground, he named
it the Prince of Wales.
   The Prince of Wales was the pilot of the $4.65 million airship
Tuesday for 20 minutes of an hourlong flight. At the Kemble Royal
Air Force base near Cirencester in Gloucestershire, the 40-year-old
heir to the British throne performed the christening cermony,
smashing a bottle of champagne on its side.
   The airship captain, Peter Hemming, said the prince was an
``absolute natural'' as pilot.
   ``He is of course an experienced pilot in his own right and he
took to it very well,'' Hemming said.

   Pierce Lyden, a Hollywood bad guy who
never won a fight or kissed a leading lady in four decades of
western films, had a good role for a change: hometown hero. But he
wasn't wearing a white hat.
   Wearing a black hat and packing pistols, Lyden rode down Main
Street in a horse-drawn carriage Monday as grand marshal of a
parade in his honor.
   ``I'm dumbfounded by the overwhelming response,'' said Lyden,
who was born in Hildreth 83 years ago and graduated from high
school in Naponee. Both towns are near Franklin, which is in
south-central Nebraska, a few miles from the Kansas border.
   ``I never thought this recognition would happen to me,'' Lyden
said as he signed an autograph for a young fan.
   Lyden's career spanned from the 1930s to the 1960s, mainly in
``B'' movies although his credits include ``The Gunfighter'' with
Gregory Peck and ``Red River'' with John Wayne.
   Lyden said he once tried to be a movie ``good guy.''
   ``I shaved off my moustache and even put on a white hat, but it
didn't do any good,'' he said. ``Hollywood had me typecast as a bad
guy.''

   Actress Audrey Hepburn observed life in
Bangkok's largest slum on a mission to publicize the plight of the
hungry, downtrodden children of the world.
   Hepburn, representing the U.N. Children's Fund, also met
Wednesday with Prateep Hata, known as the ``Slum Angel of Bangkok.''
   ``I am full of admiration for this marvelous angel as she is
called. I've seen many of these people. They are the ones that make
a big, big difference,'' Hepburn said.
   The star of ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and
``Roman Holiday'' said she hoped to make some difference in the
lives of the world's downtrodden when she left her Swiss villa and
became a UNICEF fund-raiser and goodwill ambassador two years ago.
   ``I put off growing tomatoes for a while,'' she said.
   Prateep, a slum child herself, started a foundation to care for
and educate neglected children. The foundation's seed money was the
$20,000 grant Prateep got with the 1978 Magsaysay Award, the
equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize in Asia.
   Prateep had begun a kindergarten when she was 16 years old to
care for the children she saw abandoned in the streets.
   ``She is proof that where there is determination and love there
is a way,'' said Hepburn, 60.
   Hepburn said she has little time for acting. In August, however,
she flew to Montana to spend two weeks filming a part in Steven
Spielberg's ``Always,'' which stars Richard Dreyfus and Holly
Hunter. The movie is scheduled for December release.

   Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin pleaded
guilty to urinating in the galley of an airborne jet and agreed to
pay $1,000 cleanup costs.
   Stradlin, 27, said he urinated outside the restroom of the USAir
flight on Aug. 27 because he was frustrated at being kept waiting
outside.
   Originally he was charged with interfering with the duty of a
flight crew, a felony, but the charge was dropped Tuesday when
Stradlin pled guilty to four misdemeanor charges.
   He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine, $1,000 toward cleanup costs
and write a letter of apology to the USAir crew.
   U.S. Magistrate Michael Mignella also placed Stradlin on six
months' probation, which includes counseling.
   Stradlin, whose real name is Jeffrey Dean Isbell, was arrested
at Sky Harbor International Airport during a scheduled stop in
Phoenix of an Indianapolis-Los Angeles flight. He spent one night

   More than 750 radio stations will carry the Nov. 19 broadcast,
``Country Cares for St. Jude Kids,'' to raise money for St. Jude

   First lady Barbara Bush, General Motors head
Roger Smith and Soviet author Chingiz Aitmatov were honored by a
foundation that promotes religious freedom throughout the world.
   ``Who would have thought, even two years ago, that we would be
gathering honoring the first lady of the United States, the
chairman of the largest corporation in the world and honoring a
Soviet author,'' said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the
Appeal of Conscience Foundation.
   The three each were presented Steuben crystal stars at a press
conference Wednesday night.
   Schneier said Mrs. Bush was being honored as a ``woman of
faith'' and ``for her own leadership in and commitment to improving
the quality of life in the American family.''
   Asked whether she thought it symbolic that she and Smith were
being honored along with a Soviet author, Mrs. Bush said: ``It's
just another sign of the friendship between our two countries.''
   In honoring Smith for his philanthropic contributions, Schneier
said: ``There is a perception that a successful corporation head
has no soul and no sensitivity. That's not Roger Smith.''
   Aitmatov was honored ``as a writer who has probed deeply into
the soul of the Russian people and mankind's struggle for human
dignity.''

   French designer Claude Montana will be Lanvin's new
creator of haute couture, the fashion house announced.
   Montana is the latest ready-to-wear designer to join the world
of couture after several other shakeups in the heady high fashion
scene this past year.
   Montana _ the creator of hulking, linebacker shoulders and
strong, aggressive fashion _ will be expected to turn out the
refined clothes expected by customers of the venerable old house of
Lanvin, started by Jeanne Lanvin in the 1920s.
   ``I'll be showing my first collection for 1990 next January,''
Montana said at a news conference Wednesday.
   He ducked questions about his salary. The Paris-born Montana
went to London when he was 20, and nearly starved before he created
papier-mache jewelry that was noticed by Vogue magazine.
   He returned to Paris and designed for several leather companies
before turning out his own collections starting in 1977.

<TEXT>     Sadly, the "songs" of this beloved comic storyteller and icon of
television's official Hall of Fame finally came to an end early Wednesday when
he died of a heart attack at his Beverly Hills home. He was 77.;    I can
imagine Thomas resenting this bitterly, like a performer dragged off stage by
a hook from the wings just when his act was really starting to smoke.;   
There were times, in fact, when Thomas seemed to believe the greatest threat
to his longevity was retirement.;    "God, not to perform?" he told me in
1986. "Certainly I would die. A retired person with nothing constructive to do
is a dead person.";    So Thomas never retired. For that matter, he had a
full-time job turning down offers of work. Mostly, though, he took quick, but
showy, jobs like the featured guest role he played on last Saturday's "Empty
Nest": an aged doctor who refuses to quit ("I'm like a shark," he said on the
show. "If I stop moving, I die").;    Of course, Thomas could have retired 25
years ago, his exalted place in TV history already set in concrete, if that
was any concern. It wasn't.;    "I've never really been impressed with me," he
told me over lunch one day.;    False modesty runs rampant in Hollywood, but I
believed Thomas. The lunch we were eating he had bought for us at the deli,
after standing in line with all the other fast-food customers. He liked
downplaying his celebrity status and loved to watch your reaction when he
handed you his business card, which read: Danny Thomas, out-of-work
entertainer; available any time.;    Repaying heaven;  Thomas always felt he
was a regular guy. He was at ease with his many fans and mingled with them
freely throughout his career. I saw him do it many times, starting with the
first time we met in the 1970s, when I wasn't a TV columnist but just a guy
taking an NBC studio tour with the general public. All the other stars would
head the other way if they saw the tour group coming, but Thomas stopped and
talked, shaking hands with each of us and reminding us where to send
contributions to his favorite charity, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis, Tenn.;    Thomas believed his lack of pretension sprang from his
childhood experiences as one of nine children in a relatively poor
Lebanese-American family in Toledo, Ohio. He had only one year in high school,
leaving to help support the family with a succession of odd jobs.;    "If show
business hadn't happened to me, I certainly would have become a printer's
devil or a shoemaker," he told me.;    But show business did happen to Thomas,
an instinctive storyteller who could hold an audience spellbound with yarns
like "Flat Tire and No Jack" or "Ode to a Wailing Syrian." He prayed to St.
Jude -- the patron saint of lost causes -- for success in his chosen field,
then spent all the years of his fame trying to repay the heavenly debt.;   
Originally a monologist in vaudeville and clubs, Thomas had achieved minor
stardom by the late 1940s and was given a shot at the movies as a supporting
player in films like "The Unfinished Dance" (1947) with child star Margaret
O'Brien and "Big City" (1948), this time as a Jewish cantor who adopts
O'Brien.;    Out of place in movies;  Thomas' unique personality didn't quite
jell in the movies. Even in his leading roles -- as composer Gus Kahn opposite
Doris Day in "I'll See You in My Dreams" (1951) and as the cantor's son in the
1953 remake of "The Jazz Singer" -- Thomas seemed out of his element.;   
Ironically, he didn't realize at the time that television was where he
belonged. Worse, he actually despised the medium that would make him a
legend.;    "I hated television," he said. "It was a dragon that would eat you
alive. It forced you to give away material you had developed all your life."; 
  He came into TV in 1950 as one of the four rotating stars of NBC's "Four
Star Revue," then tried to get out as fast as he could. He hated having to
condense his 18-minute stories down to 6 minutes. He had contempt for the TV
audience and its apparently short attention span.;    "Finally I quit," he
said, "saying television is for idiots.";    Daddy was no dope;  But he
reconsidered when a unique arrangement was proposed to him: A half-hour comedy
would be built around him, tailored to his brash personality. He would play a
popular entertainer with a wife and kids. In other words, he could really be
himself for the first time as a performer.;    The show was "Make Room for
Daddy," one of TV's all-time hits. It premiered on ABC in 1953, moved to CBS
in 1957 as "The Danny Thomas Show" and ran for 11 years, stopping only because
Thomas tired of the daily grind.;    It was a distinctive series because his
Danny Williams character made it one of the few family sitcoms of the period
with a positive image of a father, a warm family man who wasn't a dope. Many
of Thomas' real-life experiences as a show-biz dad made it into the scripts.
Even the title came from real life: His own kids had to give up their bedroom
to "make room for Daddy" whenever he arrived home from a club tour.;    After
Thomas retired from the show, his on-screen activity was much less intense,
but his work behind the screen blossomed. With partners Sheldon Leonard and
Aaron Spelling, he helped create some of TV's most enduring hit shows, from
"The Andy Griffith Show" and "The Dick Van Dyke Show" to "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C"
and "The Mod Squad.";    As his production empire grew, so did his dynasty.
Daughter Marlo became a major TV star in "That Girl," an ABC hit from 1966 to
1971, and remains a major force in television today, producing and/or starring
in TV movies like this season's "Held Hostage: The Sis and Jerry Levin Story"
on ABC.;    Son Tony is one of TV's most successful producers, whose current
hits include "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest." In later years, Thomas
starred in five other weekly shows: "The Danny Thomas Hour" (NBC), 1967-68, an
anthology show; "Make Room for Granddaddy" (ABC), as an older Danny Williams,
1970-71; "The Practice" (NBC), 1976-77, as a cranky Manhattan doctor; "I'm A
Big Girl Now" (ABC), 1980-81, as a cranky dentist; and "One Big Family"
(syndicated), 1986-87, as an even crankier retired vaudevillian raising his
dead younger brother's kids.;    A cigar man;  None of these shows were
ratings successes, but they failed to diminish Thomas' enduring appeal to
fans, who still turned out in enormous numbers for his frequent charity
performances for St. Jude's hospital. He did numerous guest appearances on
other shows right up to his death.;    As successful as he was in both the
performing and business ends of the entertainment world, Thomas preferred to
behave like a homebody when not working, enjoying a quiet home life with Rose
Marie, his wife of more than 50 years, and, inevitably, one of his long
cigars.;    Even at 77, Thomas continued to plan enthusiastically for
tomorrow, following the advice of his mother who taught him that "yesterday
died," so don't worry about it. Still, he was aware most of his show business
contemporaries were gone and there wasn't much future left.;    "I don't let
it get to me," he confided in 1986. "My mother told me, 'Don't get in the
habit of carrying yesterday around on your back or you'll be a hunchback
before you're 21.' ";    Fortunately, the labor of Thomas' yesterdays
continues to survive in endless TV reruns. He may have taken his final bow,
but the medium he started out hating will let him hear the laughter of
millions, wherever he is, for generations to come.  </TEXT>

EX-SUSPECT IN MOLEST CASE SUES PRIEST; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: FORMER YOUTH MINISTER WHOSE SEX TRIALS ENDED IN HUNG JURIES SAYS 
PRIVATE REMARKS TO AN EPISCOPAL PRIEST SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TAPED.

<P>
A former youth minister whose three trials for molesting a teen-age boy ended 
in hung juries has sued an Episcopal priest who tape-recorded a confession 
allegedly concerning the sexual allegations. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickard, 40, former youth pastor at St. Jude's Church in Burbank, claims 
in the lawsuit that the church's rector, Father Michael T. Flynn, violated 
Rickard's privacy and the confidentiality of confession. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks that the tape be turned over to Rickard, of Sierra Madre, or 
taken by the court. Also named in the suit, filed Nov. 28 in Burbank Superior 
Court, are St. Jude's and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Judge Thomas J. Murphy sealed the court record and ordered all those 
involved in the case not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Confession is a church rite under which a person admits wrongdoing to a priest 
for the purpose of forgiveness. Such conversations are protected under 
California law, as are conversations between doctors and patients or attorneys 
and clients. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has denied engaging in a sexual relationship but admitted feelings of 
attraction for the youth. He said Flynn urged him to confess, then misconstrued 
his words. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, 50, rector at St. Jude's for nine years, declined to comment. Canon 
Bruce MacPherson, a spokesman for the diocese, said that he was unfamiliar with 
details of the case but that tape-recording a confession does not violate 
church policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard was tried in 1989 in Redding and in 1989 and 1990 in Pasadena Superior 
Court on 120 charges of oral copulation with a 15-year-old boy who was in 
Rickard's Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, now 20 and married, spent time with Rickard in Sierra Madre and 
later, with his parents' permission, moved with Rickard to Northern California 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The parents learned of the alleged sexual relationship in 1987 and notified 
authorities. Charges were dismissed this year in both places after the third 
jury deadlocked in Pasadena in August. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn wrote Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret on Nov. 20 about the tape, 
saying it "was probably not admissible in a court of law, but it will be held 
secure for other use should Mr. Rickard's future behavior require its 
utilization." 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret at first said Rickard may have waived his right to confidentiality 
by filing the suit. But he said later that the gag order prevents further 
action by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rodiger, vice chancellor of the diocese and an attorney, said the diocese 
and the bishop will probably have little role in the lawsuit because Episcopal 
churches are independently run. Each church elects its own clergy, Rodiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodiger said the lawsuit could center on the legal difference between a 
"confession" and a "conversation." A similar case about 10 years ago in 
Northern California made such a distinction, he said. A woman convicted of 
stealing church money sued her priest, who had reported the theft because he 
interpreted her admission to him as a conversation. She lost. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Rickard has said previously that he 
spent more than $90,000 defending himself.

<P>
A former Burbank youth minister whose three trials on charges of molesting a 
teen-age boy ended in hung juries has sued an Episcopal priest who 
tape-recorded a confession allegedly concerning the sexual allegations. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickard, 40, former youth pastor -- a lay staff worker -- at St. Jude's 
Church in Burbank, says in the lawsuit that the church's rector, Father Michael 
T. Flynn, violated Rickard's privacy and the confidentiality of confession. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks that the tape be turned over to Rickard of Sierra Madre or taken 
by the court. Also named in the suit, filed Nov. 28 in Burbank Superior Court, 
are St. Jude's and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Judge Thomas J. Murphy sealed the court record and ordered all those 
involved in the case not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Confession is a church rite under which a person admits wrongdoing to a priest 
for the purpose of forgiveness. Under California law, a clergyman cannot be 
forced in court to reveal the contents of a confession, in the same way that 
the law protects conversations between doctors and patients or attorneys and 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has denied engaging in a sexual relationship but admitted feelings of 
attraction for the youth. He said Flynn urged him to confess, then misconstrued 
his words as an admission he had sex with the youth. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, 50, rector at St. Jude's for nine years, declined to comment. Canon 
Bruce MacPherson, a spokesman for the diocese, said he was unfamiliar with 
details of the case but that under Episcopalian practice a confession "would 
not be divulged." He said, however, that tape-recording a confession does not 
violate church policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard was tried in 1989 in Redding and in 1989 and 1990 in Pasadena Superior 
Court on 120 charges of oral copulation with a 15-year-old boy who was in 
Rickard's Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, now 20 and married, spent time with Rickard in Sierra Madre and 
later, with his parents' permission, moved with Rickard to Northern California 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The parents learned of the alleged sexual relationship in 1987 and notified 
authorities. Charges were dismissed this year in both sites after the third 
jury deadlocked in Pasadena in August. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Pasadena trial, and before Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret 
had decided whether to try Rickard again or dismiss the charges, Flynn wrote de 
Carteret on Nov. 20, requesting that de Carteret spare the boy and his family 
the ordeal of a fourth trial. To support his plea, he revealed the existence of 
the taped confession, arguing that he could use it to control Rickard's future 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Flynn said the tape "was probably not admissible in a court of 
law, but it will be held secure for other use should Mr. Rickard's future 
behavior require its utilization." 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret said he did not try to obtain the tape as evidence because it is 
protected under California law. A week later, de Carteret decided not to try 
Rickard again and charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
But by filing a suit against Flynn in which the tape is an issue, de Carteret 
said Rickard may have legally waived his right to keep it private. And so he 
began reconsidering moving for another trial, the prosecutor said, until the 
judge imposed the gag order that blocks access to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rodiger, vice chancellor of the diocese and an attorney, said the diocese 
and the bishop will probably have little role in the lawsuit because Episcopal 
churches are independently run. Each church elects its own clergy, Rodiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>

as a conversation. She lost.

   Pop singer Julian Lennon made $450,000 on the
sale of the mountaintop home, a former Army building that he bought
just 10 months ago, according to a published report.
   In December, the son of the late John Lennon paid $1,050,000 for
the former World War II bunker, built in the Santa Monica Mountains
by the U.S. Army and later converted to a residence.
   The young Lennon sold the one-acre property for $1.5 million,
the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified real estate sources as saying
the 4,000-square-foot residence was in bad shape, with some floors
ripped out and a rude British expression meaning ``go away''
painted on the roof to discourage photographers and fans from
flying over.

   Followers threw flowers as the Dalai
Lama, newly named Nobel laureate, paid a visit to the Buddhist
Vajrapani Institute in the Santa Cruz mountains.
   About 1,000 people lined a dirt road leading up to the temple at
the tiny retreat Saturday to greet Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai
Lama, exiled leader of Tibet and winner last week of the Nobel
Peace Prize for his non-violent efforts to free his country from
Chinese domination.
   Dressed in maroon and saffron robes and riding in a gray Jaguar,
he blew a kiss to the crowd as many threw roses.
   ``If you were a Catholic and the pope came to visit your parish,
it's about the same thing,'' said John Schwartz, one of the members
of the Vajrapani community.
   After blessing the temple, the Dalai Lama delivered a message of
peace, wisdom and compassion to an audience of 2,000 in Santa Cruz.
   ``Compassion and love is the key thing. On the family level, the
national level, the international level. It is is the key to
success and happiness,'' he said from a flower-surrounded armchair
at the Civic Auditorium.

   Once upon a time, children wrote to
Santa Claus to make their dreams come true. Now, they write to
Donald Trump.
   Third-graders at Kathleen E. Goodwin Elementary School sent
letters to the billionaire developer Friday _ by Federal Express,
no less _ asking him to buy an antique carousel to save it from
being broken up and auctioned off.
   ``Dear Mr. Trumps,'' reads one of the letters, written by
Melissa Plancon. ``Please buy the carousel. We need it bad. ... All
the kids like it. You are the riches one in the country.''
   If the carousel is sold, Valerie Hacker wrote, ``it will be
bracking children's hearts because children like amusement parks a
lot.''
   Jude Harmon was hard-nosed, trying to appeal to Trump's
legendary business savvy _ and ego.
   ``It is worth more if you buy it,'' Jude wrote. ``Children adore
it. If they destroy it they will break all 5,000 kids hearts plus
my whole school.''
   Since 1927, the wooden merry-go-round has been the main
attraction at Lake Quassapaug Amusement Park in nearby Middlebury.
   The family owned park has been hit by rising insurance premiums
that the owners say make the carousel, built in 1899, an economic
burden they no longer can afford.
   The carousel is to be auctioned off Oct. 21. Recent appraisals
put its value at more than $1 million.
   A spokeswoman for Trump said Friday that the children's plea
would be reviewed by Trump's office. Trump's executive assistant,
Norma Foerderer, said Trump receives about a thousand requests a
day for charitable contributions.

   The British Academy of Film and Television Arts
honored actress Julie Andrews with their Tribute Award for her
contribution to film.
   Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Princess Anne, presented the
award Saturday night to the 54-year-old English-born performer and
called her a ``tremendous ambassador for Britain.''
   Among the celebrities gathered at the Odeon theater in London
were actor James Coburn, who appeared with Miss Andrews in ``The
Americanization of Emily,'' and James Fox, who starred with her in
``Thoroughly Modern Millie.''
   Others who paid tribute by videotape included Dick Van Dyke,
James Garner and Dudley Moore, who starred with Miss Andrews in the
film ``10.''
   Miss Andrews began her career as a singer on the British stage
at the age of 12. At 22 she starred in the musical ``My Fair Lady''
on the Broadway stage. She became a film star with her debut as
Mary Poppins in the 1964 Walt Disney movie, for which she won an
Oscar.

 -- A group of charities honored White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu at a 
weekend dinner, and President Bush dropped by briefly to add some praise to 
that from the ballroom full of guests. The hosts of the dinner were the St. 
Jude's Children's Research Hospital and the American-Lebanese-Syrian Associated 
Charities. Sununu is of Lebanese descent, and among the guests at the black-tie 
affair was entertainer Danny Thomas, also of Lebanese extraction, who founded 
St. Jude's hospital in 1962. With Sununu and Thomas was another person of 
Lebanese descent, United Press International reporter Helen Thomas. Bush spoke 
of his "deep affection for Lebanon" and referred to the turmoil there. " . . . 
I expect every American looks at Lebanon today with agony in his heart and 
concern, hoping that he or she in some way can find a way to make a 
difference," the President said. Bush also said he had learned a lot about his 
top aide in the first months of his Administration and told the crowd: "He is a 
class act."

 -- Victor Emmanuel, son of the last Italian king, renewed an effort to end his 
43-year exile and return from Switzerland with his own son, Emmanuel Filiberto, 
who he hopes can attend an Italian military academy and university. Italian 
newspapers published a letter from Emmanuel to Italian President Francesco 
Cossiga in which he recognized the Italian republic for the first time, but he 
also said he was not relinquishing his claim to the throne last held by his 
father, King Umberto II. Italy's 1947 constitution forbids the entry of 
Emmanuel and his heirs, and to change the ban would require approval of a 
two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament. The widow of Umberto II, 
former Queen Maria Jose, has visited Italy occasionally since the government 
lifted the ban on her return in 1987.

 -- The University of Iowa's Hancher Auditorium launched an effort to silence 
some discordant notes during its concerts. Ailing audience members are being 
asked to squelch their coughs with free cough drops from the ushers, or to 
retire to a soundproof observation room where they can wheeze and sneeze 
without ruining the music. Japanese pianist Mitsuko Uchida was disturbed by 
persistent coughing from the audience during her performance at the hall in 
Iowa City. So the program for a recent appearance by violinist Isaac Stern 
urged the crowd, dubbed the Hancher Hackers by a local newspaper, to keep 
things quiet. The hall's marketing director, Judith Hurtig, said the effort 
seems to have worked, with performances now notable for the audience's 
stillness. DAVE JOHNSON

<LEADPARA>  WHEN St. Jude's Episcopal Church in Cupertino announced a plan to bury ashes
in a memorial garden, it sparked a genuine culture clash and more than a
little confusion and rumor. A Solomonic judgment was called for and was
delivered, at least for now.;    Founded about 30 years ago, St. Jude's wanted
to follow the Episcopalian custom of burying cremated remains of parishioners
on church grounds. However, City Hall had to approve.  </LEADPARA>

REACH A SOLOMONIC DECISION
IN CEMETERY CULTURE CLASH  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Stunned by a turnout of about 150 concerned Cupertino residents, city
officials postponed a decision for weeks. Several Chinese-Americans objected
on spiritual grounds; they did not want to live near a cemetery. Some Anglo
and Asian-American Christians also objected, reflecting a broader-based
opposition to putting cemeteries in the middle of neighborhoods. And some
citizens were worried that an exodus of Chinese-American homeowners would
cause property values to plummet.;    Clearly no simple matter. But then
again, with differing cultural, religious, neighborhood and homeowner values
swirling together, how could it be? Nothing could be more American than this
convergence of differences. Fortunately, hysteria gave way to cooler
thinking.;    Opposition lessened once neighbors learned the plot would be
about the size of a small backyard and only three or four burials would occur
each year. We are told that next door neighbors approved.;    With a vibrant
Korean ministry in the parish and more than a dozen community programs, St.
Jude's is far from the insular and intolerant church some thought it was when
the controversy erupted.;    City Hall approved the ash burial recently and
the church has agreed to postpone burials for at least two years. The
arrangement is a fitting compromise.;    Under zoning laws, St. Jude's
application had to be judged as a question of appropriate land use. It would
have been legally difficult to deny St. Jude's a small memorial garden when
other churches have them.;    Yet the church's two-year waiting period shows
its willingness to listen to its community, to recognize its social
responsibility in a multicultural town.;    Things can change in two years.
There always will be some individuals unwilling to compromise. But in a land
of immigrants, the trick is to reach a level of mutual respect necessary for
communities to grow, adapt and prosper.  </TEXT>

   St. Jude Medical Inc. said it adopted an anti-takeover measure that involves the distribution of preferred stock-purchase rights on each share of its common. 

   The maker of medical products said under certain circumstances, the rights would allow holders to buy shares in an acquiring company, or St. Jude, at half price. 
They will be distributed to stock of record April 6. 

   St. Jude said the rights aren't being distributed in response to any takeover attempt.

<TEXT>
   With about 200 stations now programming in
Spanish to the tune of $176 million in advertising revenue last
year, U.S. Hispanic radio is booming.
   But the sound wasn't always sweet, as seen in the new film,
``Break of Dawn.''
   The movie, released in selected Southwestern cities, re-creates
the story of Spanish radio pioneer Pedro J. Gonzalez, who was
imprisoned after his on-air protests of Depression-era deportations
of Mexicans.
   ``It's a story about justice prevailing over injustice,'' said
producer Jude Pauline Eberhard. Set in Los Angeles in the 1920s and
'30s, the film tells how Gonzalez was paroled after being sent to
San Quentin on trumped up rape charges following his advocacy
broadcasts.
   Gonzalez parlayed his musical talents and eye for business into
a popular Spanish-language radio program. But it ended when he was
sent to prison on charges that were later recanted by the woman who
had allegedly been raped.
   Mexican recording star Oscar Chavez plays Gonzalez, portraying
him as he first translates radio commercials into Spanish, then
sings with his guitar and, finally, pays a station for early
morning airtime. Gonzalez and his wife sold advertising on the
show, making a profit on the difference.
   Called ``Los Madrugadores'' (``The Early Risers''), the Los
Angeles-based program developed a strong following among Hispanics
with a mix of live music, discussion of issues and commercials.
   Now 94, Gonzalez lives with his wife, Maria, in Northern
California and was a consultant for the film, said Isaac
Artenstein, who wrote and directed the movie.
   To insure realism, Artenstein used both Spanish and English
dialogue. ``You can't have Pedro talking and singing in English if
you say he was the first (radio broadcaster) in Spanish,'' said
Artenstein.
   But the bilingual approach can pose distribution problems.
Eberhard said exhibitors are shying away from the film because they
don't know whether to market it as an English or Spanish movie.
``It's scary for the distributors because of the natural language
flow,'' she said.
   Though he changed some characters' names, Artenstein said that
all of the film's main roles are based on real people, including an
activist Mexican consul, a district attorney who helps frame
Gonzalez, and a teen-age girl who falsely accuses Gonzalez of
raping her.
   Courtroom testimony in the film is taken from Gonzalez' trial
transcripts unearthed by a law library archivist. Artenstein said
Los Angeles' Spanish-language daily, La Opinion, also had extensive
coverage of Gonzalez' case, but the English-language media did not
have one story.
   ``Break of Dawn,'' which was shot for $850,000, also stars Maria
Rojo as Gonzalez' wife. Others in the film include Tony Plana, Pepe
Serna, Peter Henry Schroeder, Kamala Lopez, Valarie Wildman and
Socorro Valdez. The film was independently produced by San
Diego-based Cinewest Productions.
   Los Angeles is now the nation's largest Hispanic media market,
with $32.7 million spent on Spanish-language radio advertising in
1988, according to Hispanic Business magazine. Seven radio stations
and two television stations now air Spanish broadcasts full time in
the city.
   It is a far cry from the days when Gonzalez and his wife had to
pay stations in advance for pre-dawn airtime.

FDR'S YACHT IS GETTING SHIPSHAPE; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: RESTORATION FUNDS ARE RUNNING SHORT, BUT THERE ARE EFFORTS TO MAKE THE 
POTOMAC PART OF A HISTORIC PARK IN OAKLAND. THE CITY HOPES THAT IT WILL LURE

OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt plucked from obscurity a 165-foot 
Coast Guard cutter and ordered it refitted with a dining salon, staterooms and 
a hand-operated elevator to accommodate the wheelchair he used after being 
crippled by polio. 
</P>
<P>
For the next decade, until his death, the austere, gleaming-white yacht, 
rechristened the Potomac, served as a "floating White House," where Roosevelt 
entertained kings, queens and political leaders and spent countless weekends 
fishing from the teak-covered deck, a haven from the troubles of Depression and 
war. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the ship is in the final stages of a long, against-the-odds face 
lift at the Port of Oakland after years of bouncing from one owner to another, 
including Elvis Presley, before literally sinking into ignominy after being 
seized by U.S. Customs in a drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, an Oakland Democrat, will 
introduce a bill in Congress later this month to establish the USS Potomac 
National Historical Park. The Potomac itself would be a floating museum of the 
Roosevelt era, ferrying schoolchildren on San Francisco Bay and the Delta. 
</P>
<P>
The designation would make the restored ship and a planned visitor center 
eligible for an estimated $1 million in annual federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, the costly restoration effort, always a hand-to-mouth affair, is in 
some danger of running aground even as workers install the woodwork and light 
fixtures in the staterooms, salon and fantail. 
</P>
<P>
To date, at least $3.5 million raised from government and private sources has 
been spent to refurbish the ship, not counting thousands of dollars' worth of 
donated equipment and building materials. And the furnishings have yet to be 
bought. 
</P>
<P>
"We're almost out of money," Dan Holdgate, project manager for the rebuilding, 
said on a recent tour of the ship. "The Potomac probably will be running by 
mid-September, but we might not have the money to buy life rafts and vests." 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising efforts continue, and officials expect the restoration to be 
completed. But they note that a key to the ship's future will be qualifying for 
government funds. 
</P>
<P>
Given the vessel's tumultuous past, it comes as no surprise to many associated 
with the restoration that the Potomac still faces rough sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Originally called the Electra, the ship was built by the Manitowoc Ship 
Building Co. in Manitowoc, Wis., in 1934. Its first duty was to chase 
rumrunners, who were still around in the early days after Prohibition was 
repealed in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Roosevelt was using the yacht Sequoia, an ornate vessel not 
particularly to his liking. Aides feared that it would be difficult to evacuate 
the crippled leader should the wooden vessel catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt, an avid sailor and former assistant secretary of the Navy, picked 
the Electra for conversion into a presidential yacht at a cost of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes, a hand-powered elevator was installed in the after stack 
to enable the President to ride to and from the boat deck. A large, 
leather-covered settee was built into the fantail; photographs of the time show 
Roosevelt, with his trademark cigarette holder, enjoying cocktails with guests 
there. Wicker chairs and tables and -- when Roosevelt's military advisers 
deemed necessary -- bulletproof glass completed the outdoor furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Below decks, stainless steel bathtubs were added in the President's and guest 
quarters. Leather furniture, wood paneling and brass fixtures were installed 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
In one interior room containing radio equipment, Roosevelt conducted at least 
one of his famous "Fireside Chats." 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a boat that could be used for a number of purposes, but when 
you used it for a yacht, you weren't ashamed of it," FDR's oldest son, James, 
recalled in an interview at his Corona del Mar home. Visitors, he said, often 
were astonished that the ship was quite plain. 
</P>
<P>
Log entries show that it was used for travels from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Key 
West. Roosevelt often used it for fishing jaunts on the Chesapeake Bay. In 
1939, England's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (now the Queen Mum) joined 
the President and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on a journey down the Potomac 
River to Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Potomac was part of a notable ruse in 1941. FDR left Maine aboard the yacht 
but secretly met a cruiser that carried him to a rendezvous with British Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill off Newfoundland, where the two leaders signed the 
Atlantic Charter, creating the wartime alliance. Aboard the Potomac, crew 
members stood in for the President, fishing from the deck in boat cloak and 
snap-brim hat. The secret rendezvous went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, President Harry S. Truman replaced the Potomac with a larger 
vessel, the Williamsburg. The Potomac was mustered out of the Navy, 
decommissioned by the Coast Guard and sold to the state of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland sold the ship in 1960 to a company that used it to ferry passengers 
and freight between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the next few years, 
it changed hands many times. In 1964, Presley bought it for $55,000. He later 
donated it to Danny Thomas' pet project, St. Jude's Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., 
which planned to convert it to a restaurant to raise money. The cost proved too 
great, and St. Jude's auctioned it off. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a Southern California group pulled off the damaged teak upper deck and 
poured concrete, planning to turn the ship into a floating disco palace. That 
didn't work either. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the vessel was looking shabby. An effort to convert it into a 
tourist attraction at San Pedro's Ports O' Call went nowhere. The ship was 
towed to Stockton and then to San Francisco's Pier 26. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, 1980, U.S. Customs seized the Potomac and a companion vessel, the 
Valkyure, which had 21 tons of marijuana on board. Although no drugs were found 
aboard the Potomac, it was a case of guilt by association. The yacht was 
apparently being used as a command post for drug smugglers purporting to be a 
charity for crippled children. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy towed the bedraggled vessel to the Treasure Island naval installation 
in San Francisco Bay. In 1981, the rusted hull was pierced by pilings, and the 
Potomac sank in 35 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy salvage crew spent 12 days lifting her from the muddy bottom of the bay. 
That April, the Port of Oakland, the sole bidder, bought the rusted, derelict 
heap for $15,000 at auction. It hauled it to dry-dock and provided $400,000 in 
seed money to help establish the Assn. for the Preservation of the Presidential 
Yacht Potomac, a mostly volunteer organization charged with overseeing the 
project. Congress authorized $2.5 million for restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
All seemed fine until workers struck the shipyard that won the contract. 
Eventually, workers at the Colberg yard in Stockton spent months welding on a 
new hull and replacing the pilot cabin. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration is now in the final stages back at the Oakland waterfront, 
workers hoping to have the vessel shipshape for a recommissioning. Historic 
photos are guiding them as they attempt to duplicate furniture and match the 
ship's appearance, inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to putting in 8 to 10 hours a day, project manager Holdgate spends 
an estimated 25 hours a week in his home garage finishing wood for cabinets and 
trim -- "to save money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of the ship as a national landmark and park would be a boon for 
Oakland, which has struggled to make Jack London Waterfront a tourist 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to have a land-based FDR interpretive center at an already 
completed Roosevelt Pier, built with a $446,000 grant from the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Potomac also stands a good chance in October of being named a national 
historic landmark by the National Park System Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the only memorial (to FDR) on the West Coast and would be 
differentiated from the others on the East Coast, which are immovable," said 
James Roosevelt, 82, a close adviser to his father who often sailed aboard the 
Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Delgado, chief maritime historian for the National Park Service in 
Washington and head of the National Maritime Initiative, a program supporting 
preservation of historic vessels, hailed the effort. Aboard the Potomac, he 
said, "there very much is a sense of FDR."

ST. JUDE HOSPITAL TO OPEN A 37-BED SKILLED-NURSING FACILITY ON MARCH 21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Later this month St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton 
expects to become the first hospital in Orange County to open skilled-nursing 
facilities on their premises. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Ross, the hospital's vice president for rehabilitation and mental health 
services, said the hospital expects to start admitting patients to its 37-bed 
skilled-nursing facility on March 21, assuming it obtains final state licensing 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
He said the skilled-nursing facility will take patients released from 
acute-care hospitals -- primarily from St. Jude Hospital -- who need special 
rehabilitation and other nursing services before returning home or to 
convalescent facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows us to have the patients receive the most appropriate and economical 
level of care," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said that hospital-based skilled nursing services have the advantage of 
providing convenience to the patients who can use the hospital's diagnostic 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He said the skilled-nursing facility is housed on one floor of a wing at St. 
Jude Hospital that previously contained administrative offices and various 
ancillary services. Over the past six months, he said, that space has been 
converted for patient beds as well as a rehabilitation gym, beauty shop and 
recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Room and board at the new nursing facility will cost $250 a day, Ross said. 
Approved Medicare patients -- representing the vast majority of patients -- 
will pay $25.50 a day for the first 8 days. After that, he said, Medicare will 
pick up the entire tab for care up to 150 days. 
</P>
<P>
Also planning to open skilled-nursing facilities are Anaheim Memorial Hospital 
and Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Dopler, director of communications at Anaheim Memorial Hospital, said 
that hospital already has received state approval for a 20-bed skilled-nursing 
facility scheduled to open April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center, previously La Habra 
Community Hospital, is planning to convert about 36 of its acute care hospital 
beds to skilled nursing beds. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hanna, the hospital's administrator, said architectural plans for the 
skilled-nursing facility, which will be established in part of the existing 
hospital, are under review by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development. He said he hopes the facility will open in the late spring or 
early summer. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilwee, director of the Orange County office of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California, said he welcomes the trend toward the creation of 
hospital-based skilled nursing facilities. He said it gives hospitals a 
potentially profitable opportunity for diversification while providing a needed 
medical service. LESLIE BERKMAN

   It's fitting the little statue labeled St.
``Expedite'' should end up at Our Lady of Guadeloupe. The old Roman
Catholic church on the edge of the French Quarter with its shrine
to St. Jude has long been a haven to the homeless, the helpless and
many of life's misfits.
   On a bright spring morning a young man kneels in prayer at the
altar, an elderly woman lights a candle at the statue of St. Jude,
and an old man in ragged clothes sits in a patch of sunlight by the
door, his shopping bags around his feet.
   ``People come here from all over the city, but we have a lot of
people who come from the French Quarter and here on Rampart Street
and from the Iberville housing project directly behind us,'' said
the Rev. William Zapalac, who has been at the church eight years.
``We see a lot of life in this location. Things are always
hopping.''
   Called the Mortuary Chapel for many years, the church was built
in 1826 to handle the funerals of victims of the an outbreak of
yellow fever.
   ``In those days they thought it was spread by the dead so they
didn't want to have them in the Quarter,'' said Millie Brown, an
80-year-old parishoner. ``They'd bring them here and then zip them
right across the street to the cemetery. They say there would be
hundreds of wagons with coffins lined up on them outside the
church.''
   St. ``Expedite'' showed up about the turn of the century. Legend
has it the statue arrived at the docks without paperwork or address.
   ``The only thing they saw was the word `Expedite' on the side of
the crate,'' said Tom Finney, spokesman for the New Orleans
Diocese. ``In those days there were a lot of first-generation
Italians and Irish on the New Orleans docks and they didn't read
English very well. They thought `Expedite' was the name of a saint
so they delivered the statute to the church.''
   Today it stands by the door, a cross in one hand and a sheaf of
wheat in the other. The name on the statue is in quotes, St.
``Expedite.''
   ``There really is a St. Expedite. I don't know if this is him or
not, but he fits in here, anyway,'' said Zapalac.
   Four times a year the little church is host for a nine-day St.
Jude Novena that draws 3,000 to 4,000 people a day. St. Jude, the
patron saint of lost causes, spends the rest of the year dealing
with a variety of people and pleas from the local community. There
is no lack of work, Zapalac said.
   ``Being right here by the French Quarter we get a lot of the
more unusual people from there. In New Orleans, I find people are
much more tolerant of unusual people. Some places, people would be
afraid of many of the people we really enjoy here,'' the priest
said.
   Rampart Street, with its seedy hotels and cheap bars, has become
a mecca for the homeless, Zapalac said.
   ``We're seeing more and more homeless people all the time. Some
of them we get to know very well,'' he said.
   Some of them, like a mother and daughter who lived on the
streets, are puzzles without solutions, he said.
   The church found housing several times for the mother, who was
in her 50s, and her daughter, in her 30s, but they always returned
to the streets, Zapalac said.
   ``I don't know what happened to them. They finally disappeared.
I think they were afraid of being trapped somehow if they stayed in
the housing we found for them,'' he said.
   Iberville, a vast collection of decaying brick buildings, is
home for many of the city's poor, including many of the church's
parishioners.
   But on Saturday nights it's not problems that are the focus of
the early Mass, it's the city and its music that come to the
forefront in the church's Jazz Mass. The Jazz Mass is the only one
in the world, Zapalac believes.
   ``There's always piano and organ and drums and trumpet and
sometimes other instruments, depending on who's here,'' he said.
``It's really something when we get going.''

Officials of a Japanese health services company last week visited the St. 
Joseph &amp; St. Jude Home Health Network in Orange to gather information that 
will help them establish Japan's first home health-care service. Sherry 
Carmack, administrator of the St. Joseph &amp; St. Jude Home Health Network, 
said she met last Thursday with top officials of the newly formed home health 
division of Duskin Co. Ltd. of Osaka, Japan. Carmack said Service Master Home 
Health, a Chicago-based management firm that operates the home health care 
service for St. Joseph and St. Jude hospitals in Orange County, is assisting 
Duskin in setting up a pilot home nursing program in Tokyo. Carmack said 
Duskin's home health service will be a first for Japan and is scheduled to 
begin operation in March.

When Ronald Matricaria arrived as president and chief executive of Minnesota
heart valve maker St Jude Medical he found a company in rude financial
health.
The business had sales of more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 122m) a year and
net profit margins, after tax, of 43 per cent. Its one product, a heart
valve, enjoyed an 85 per cent US market share and was either first or second
in almost every other large market for medical devices. There was a cash
pile of Dollars 350m.
Yet nobody seemed to want the company's shares. The historic price earnings
ratio had sunk to just 11, at the bottom of the pile in the US healthcare
sector.
'We had spent four years in paralysis. We couldn't diversify without hurting
profitability,' says Matricaria.
'There were several external (non-executive) directors, all senior
executives from large healthcare companies. They all had strong views and
there was never agreement on strategy. There was no plan,' he says.
At the first board meeting after Matricaria joined  - from Eli Lilly, the US
drug company, where he had been head of the medical devices division  - a
director asked him: 'What are we going to buy?'
Matricaria's response was to say that first he had to find out what
investors wanted him to do.
A shareholder survey showed that greater risk-taking and a spread of that
risk were the main priorities. No one mentioned profitability as an area of
concern.
The replies may have been obvious, but Matricaria had another reason for
consulting shareholders.
'Two-thirds of US companies that diversify get hit by shareholder suits,'
says Matricaria. 'And over the months that followed consultation there was a
big turnover in our shareholder lists. Some bought and others sold.'
The next stage was to bring in external advisers  - PA Consultants  - to
identify which of St Jude's 'core competencies' could be applied to other
businesses and hence form the basis for an acquisitions stra-tegy.
PA started off by identifying 191 processes that St Jude used in heart valve
manufacture. Forty eight were labelled as 'critical', of which 15 were
considered 'world class'.
This group was narrowed down to just eight which would be useful in other
business areas.
The consultants and the company then compared these eight with the 16
therapeutic areas in which medical device companies work. They wanted to
label potential takeover targets according to whether they could benefit
from St Jude's technologies.
'Six or seven companies were then identified, and we then had to find out
which was for sale,' says Matricaria.
Given that Matricaria had just come from Eli Lilly, there were perhaps
inevitable rumours that St Jude wanted to buy Lilly's heart pacemaker
business. That speculation came to nothing.
The Siemens heart pacemaker business was also on St Jude's list and luckily
for Matricaria the German electronics giant had just conducted a review of
its businesses and concluded that it was no longer interested in that
activity.
Talks between St Jude and Siemens began in early 1994 and a Dollars 500m
deal was announced in June.
The irony is that St Jude's profitability has fallen sharply: at the
company's January first quarter results following the acquisition, net
profit margin after tax will have fallen to 17 per cent, according to Kurt
Kruger, medical devices analyst at Hambrecht and Quist. But the shareholders
are happy.
The price earnings ratio is at 17, corresponding to a share price that has
risen from Dollars 29 to Dollars 40.
Looking back, Matricaria gives a telling, if subconscious, twist to the
maxim about putting the customer first. 'We had to become more
customer-oriented and find out what our shareholders really wanted from us,'
he says.

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: 'REHAB RADIO' IS SOCIAL THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you're in the hospital, the outside world can sometimes seem a thousand 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
That's especially true for long-term rehabilitation patients, who often spend 
weeks or even months as inpatients undergoing therapy for strokes, brain 
injuries or other major problems. For patients who have trouble moving or 
communicating, the isolation is compounded. 
</P>
<P>
But at St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton, rehab patients 
have a way to reach beyond the walls and make new friends without interrupting 
therapy. It's called Rehab Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"CQ, CQ, CQ, 10 meters, Whiskey Delta Six Bravo Poppa Tango," says volunteer 
April Moell, enunciating clearly into the microphone she's holding. Behind her 
is an amateur radio transceiver; in front of her is a roomful of patients in 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
"CQ is like, 'I'm seeking you,' " Moell explains. "It's kind of like fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, before anyone has a chance to shy away, she moves around the room with 
the microphone like an amateur radio Oprah Winfrey, making sure everyone has a 
chance to try. By the time all the CQs have been spoken, responses are coming 
in so fast they're overlapping, and Moell hurries to write down all the call 
letters she can. 
</P>
<P>
"We've attracted a crowd," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's a bright sunny afternoon in Fullerton, and apparently other atmospheric 
conditions are favorable as well. "Yesterday we couldn't even talk next door, 
let alone to California," says the voice that comes through the radio. Her name 
is Pat, and she's in Virginia. "It looks like we're finally going to get some 
sunshine here today," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Moell gives the rehab patients a chance to introduce themselves. For some, like 
Viola Grace, it isn't easy. She suffered a stroke a few weeks earlier, and 
although she has improved since she arrived at the hospital, she still has 
trouble speaking her name. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi . . . la," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi-O-la," Moell tells her. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi-O-la," she repeats into the microphone, much clearer this time. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime amateur radio enthusiast, Moell founded the St. Jude radio program 
11 years ago when a local widow donated her late husband's ham equipment to the 
hospital. A therapist herself -- until last month, she was director of 
occupational therapy at St. Jude -- Moell finds ways to individualize the radio 
sessions to complement each patient's therapy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping Grace with her speech, for example, Moell works with 
another stroke patient who needs to relearn the left-to-right visual pattern 
necessary for reading. For that, she gives him a turn at reading the weather 
report on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all they can manage is a barely audible "Hi," in the case of one 
brain-injury patient, Moell tries to include everyone. And the folks out there 
in radio land try to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely like to put all your names in my log," Pat says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the program's radio contacts send in QSL cards -- post cards used in 
ham radio to acknowledge a contact -- and some go so far as to send individual 
cards for everyone who was at the session, Moell says. "That really means a lot 
to them." And the rehab patients reciprocate as they can. "If they can't write, 
then we let them stamp the cards," Moell says. One radio contact who lived 
nearby dropped by to deliver QSL cards in person, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most hams have been really wonderful. They seem to sense what's going on," she 
says. She also explains the situation over the radio, answering questions about 
the program from curious radio operators. 
</P>
<P>
During this session, hams across the nation and in Canada acknowledged the 
group's "CQs" and waited patiently for a turn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first experience talking to people in therapy," says Pat, who 
listened as the patients talked, at Moell's prompting, about what they like to 
do when they're not in the hospital, and what kind of therapy they're working 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking and my leg," Grace says. Her husband, John, sits next to her and 
offered encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
After everyone has had a chance to talk to Pat, she signs off and gives others 
a chance to talk to the Fullerton group. They meet Harry, a retired optometrist 
in Mississippi, and Randy, a minister in Indiana, as well as two men on 
opposite sides of the U.S.-Canadian border in New York and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we call good wheelchair copy," Moell says to one contact whose 
transmission is coming in strong. "We can hear you clearly all over the room." 
</P>
<P>
Hams use phonetics to make their call letters understandable, and Moell often 
deviates from the preferred words to make a humorous point. "This is Whiskey 
Delta Six Bed Pan Trainer," she says, reminding her audience that the 
transmission is coming from inside a hospital. "They always get that right 
away," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important for them to maintain contact with the outside world," 
says Richard Boyle, a recreational therapist who works with Moell on the 
program. "We've even had patients who've gone on and gotten their ham radio 
licenses after trying it here." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling of isolation isn't so bad for those who have frequent visitors, 
says Bob Grigsby, a spinal cord injury patient who enjoys participating in the 
radio sessions. "My family has been very supportive, but everybody doesn't have 
that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people who've gotten kind of teary-eyed," Moell says. "A lot of 
times the people out there will say, 'We'll say prayers for you at dinner 
tonight.' It means a lot to think that there's somebody they just met who cares 
about them who doesn't have to. The staff here cares, too, but it's their job. 
For the hams, it isn't. But in a way, they're therapists, too."

   HOLLYWOOD -- D. Constantine Conte lives in two worlds.
   One is filled with the big money and beautiful people of
Hollywood, where Mr. Conte, a six-foot, 200-pound man,
hobnobs with movie stars and movie makers, such as Nick Nolte
and Dino DiLaurentiis. In this world, Mr. Conte, known as
Dino to friends, is a successful Hollywood producer, whose
credits include "48 Hours" and "Conan the Barbarian." He's
the man who co-produced "Another 48 Hours," the just-released
sequel starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte. And he's the man
who, friends say, is generous and trustworthy, who always has
a kind word for a secretary and whose mother lives at his
home. "There will be a seat reserved in Valhalla for Dino
Conte," says John Milius, the movie director.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But then there's the other world. In this one, Dino Conte
is a convicted felon and onetime confederate of a reputed New
York City mobster. He also has been the subject of periodic
surveillance by law enforcement authorities worried that mob
infiltration of Hollywood is increasing. Their internal
reports allege that Mr. Conte has had associations with
reputed mob figures.
   Mr. Conte declined to be interviewed about his past or the
allegations about him. His lawyer, Allan Sigel, would only
communicate by letter. He says his client is a "respected
member of the movie industry" and the victim of
"misinformation and false statements of fact."
   Yet the suggestion that Mr. Conte hasn't associated with
criminal figures is repeatedly challenged by law enforcement
reports, business records and, in at least one case, by a
former criminal himself -- Dennis Tinerino. Mr. Tinerino was
convicted of conspiracy in 1978, about the same time he
shared an office address with Mr. Conte in Beverly Hills.
While Mr. Conte's lawyer says Mr. Conte doesn't know the man,
Mr. Tinerino remembers otherwise: "I used to see Dino all the
time," Mr. Tinerino says in an interview. "We used to hang
out together at Pips Club," a Los Angeles restaurant and
social club. Mr. Conte also tried helping him with a
movie-related business venture, he says.
   Mr. Conte hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing since he
moved west. He also went to the police in 1982 to assure them
he doesn't have any ties to the mob. At the same time, he
complained to the police about what he felt were untrue
statements they had made about him, according to a 1984
police report.
   Nonetheless, law enforcement officials have been
interested in his activities for years. What their
examinations have revealed, as recently as 1988, are
suspected connections -- some direct, some merely indirect --
between the well-known producer and organized crime figures,
according to law enforcement officials and internal
documents.
   Police concern about mob infiltration of Hollywood has a
long history. Back in the 1930s, the Chicago mob, which
infiltrated Hollywood's unions, extorted hundreds of
thousands of dollars from studios in return for promises of
labor peace, according to "Dark Victory," a book on the
entertainment industry by Dan Moldea. In the 1940s a top
industry official and two labor leaders were sent to jail for
the mob-related payoffs, and, in the years since, scandals
involving organized crime have periodically hit Hollywood.
   As for Mr. Conte, he has drawn police attention because of
his success, his past and the company that authorities say he
has kept. For instance, a 1988 Los Angeles police department
report asserts that the movie maker has a "close association"
with Vincent "Jimmy Blue Eyes" Alo, who, according to a
report submitted to the U.S. Senate by the New York Police
Department, is a reputed top member of New York's powerful
Genovese crime family. A 1983 Los Angeles district attorney's
office internal report identifies Mr. Conte as a suspected
"associate" of the Genovese family who reports to Mr. Alo.
And a 1984 Los Angeles police report says that, in his
meeting with police officers, Mr. Conte admitted to
"numerous" meetings with Mr. Alo but said they were simply to
discuss doing a movie or novel about Mr. Alo.
   However, Mr. Sigel, Mr. Conte's lawyer, says his client
has "never attended a meeting with a Mr. Alo" or been a
"business associate." Mr. Alo couldn't be located for comment
and a lawyer who has in the past represented him declined to
comment.
   William Jordan, a private investigator who says he has
worked on movie projects with Mr. Conte and who has in the
past helped the producer try to counter allegations about mob
connections, says in an interview that Mr. Conte isn't in
business with mobsters. He adds, though, that Mr. Conte has
met with suspected "low-level" mob figures. "He told me he
was just meeting with neighborhood friends from his
childhood," says Mr. Jordan, who adds that he advised the
producer to stop seeing those friends and believes Mr. Conte
followed that advice.
   Mr. Jordan also adds that his familiarity with Mr. Conte
goes back only to when the two met on a movie project in the
early- to mid-1970s. What happened before that, he isn't
entirely sure. "I don't know much about his past," he says.
   There are also indications that at least part of the
movie-industry establishment is aware of law enforcement
officials' interest in Mr. Conte. Several years ago,
investigators for the Los Angeles county district attorney
privately warned an outside attorney for Paramount Pictures
about Mr. Conte, according to a person familiar with the
meeting. Around the same time, Michael Eisner, then
Paramount's president, was contacted by police
organized-crime detectives who wanted to discuss Mr. Conte.
Mr. Eisner is now chairman of Walt Disney Co.
   Mr. Eisner, through a spokesman, says he only barely
recalls meeting with police and hasn't any reason to be
suspicious of Mr. Conte. Similarly, a Paramount spokeswoman
says her studio hasn't any reason to think Mr. Conte is
anything other than a respected movie producer.
   Mr. Conte keeps a relatively low profile. Studio releases
about his movies offer scant information about him, and even
his friends say they know little about his private life. "In
all the years I've worked with him, we haven't talked about
his past," says Kurt Neumann, an executive at Warner Bros.
   But from what can be pieced together from law enforcement
records and dozens of interviews with police, friends and
associates, Mr. Conte's biography goes something like this:
   A Greek-American, Mr. Conte was born in 1933 in New York
City. In one letter, Mr. Sigel, the attorney, says Mr. Conte
was "educated in Greek theater and drama," but didn't
elaborate.
   In his early life, Mr. Conte sometimes used the name Dino
Harris. As Dino Harris, he began working in the late 1950s at
various Manhattan bars. Roughly during this period, Mr. Conte
got to know Salvatore "Sally Burns" Granello, who is
identified in law enforcment reports as a member of the
Lucchese crime family. Mr. Conte is identified in law
enforcement documents as a suspected bodyguard for Mr.
Granello.
   In 1964, Mr. Conte and Mr. Granello were charged in New
York state court in Mineola, N.Y., with the attempted
extortion of a Long Island jukebox distributor. According to
New York state court records in the case, Mr. Granello and
some associates beat the businessman's wife with a pistol. A
Nassau County police officer, who reviewed the court records,
says Mr. Conte apparently wasn't present for the beating.
   Mr. Conte pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
commit extortion and was sentenced to six months in the
county jail. Mr. Granello was convicted and sentenced to 18
months in jail. But Mr. Granello would soon meet a savage
end: In 1970, he was found dead in the trunk of a car in
lower Manhattan, garrotted and shot four times in the head.
   Separately that same year, Mr. Conte also encountered new
trouble. Along with four others, he was indicted by a federal
grand jury in New York in connection with the interstate
theft of $271,000 in traveler's checks. Mr. Conte and his
co-defendants were part of a broader, nationwide securities
theft ring with ties to organized crime, according to
testimony presented at a 1971 Senate hearing by the confessed
leader of another theft ring, and according to materials
prepared by the staff of the Senate permanent subcommittee on
investigations.
   Mr. Conte again pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count and
in 1972 was sentenced to three years at a maximum-security
federal prison in Atlanta. He was released March 14, 1974,
with time off for good behavior.
   Around this time, Mr. Conte apparently began his film
career. A 1984 press release from Universal Pictures about a
Conte movie says Mr. Conte had been in the "production end of
film making for the past 14 years."
   An early patron was film maker  Dino DeLaurentiis, say
friends and associates of Mr. Conte. Larry Gleason, a
Paramount official, says Mr. DeLaurentiis once told him that
he and Mr. Conte first worked together on the 1972
DeLaurentiis movie "The Valachi Papers," a true-life story of
a mobster turned government witness. Mr. DeLaurentiis "didn't
say what Conte was doing on the movie," Mr. Gleason adds. Mr.
DeLaurentiis declined to be interviewed.
   By the late 1970s, Mr. Conte was working out of Mr.
DeLaurentiis's Beverly Hills office, according to a 1977
police report and movie-industry people who saw him there. On
a 1978 DeLaurentiis movie, "Brink's Job," Mr. Conte "was like
the troubleshooter . . . keeping an eye on things for Mr.
DeLaurentiis," recalls Domingo Rodriguez, a United Scenic
Artists union official who says he dealt with Mr. Conte.
   Law enforcement reports also assert that Mr. Conte has
been a close associate of an actor named Jude Farese, and was
connected through him to his brother Thomas Farese, who,
according to a 1988 report by the Senate permanent
subcommitee on investigations, is a member of New York's
Colombo crime family. A 1978 Los Angeles police report, for
instance, says Mr. Conte was the "exclusive" driver of a
Cadillac leased in the name of Jude Farese at a Florida
address used by Thomas Farese for a now-defunct company he
called Olympic Film Productions. The report says police
suspected Mr. Conte was helping run Olympic's Los Angeles
office for a time.
   Mr. Conte's lawyer says Mr. Conte has never heard of
Olympic Film. The producer didn't respond to an inquiry from
this newspaper about his alleged contact with the Fareses.
   Jude Farese, through his agent, declined to be interviewed
about Mr. Conte. "He says he knows where your questions are
going to lead and isn't interested in talking about it," the
agent says.
   Thomas Farese is currently in a Florida federal prison for
conspiracy to distribute marijuana. He couldn't be reached
for comment.
   Then there's Mr. Tinerino, who went to jail for conspiracy
and whom Mr. Conte, through his lawyer, says he doesn't know.
According to Los Angeles police reports and California state
corporation records, which list business addresses, Mr. Conte
had the same office address as Mr. Tinerino, who was a
principal in a large out-call massage service.
   In 1978, Mr. Tinerino pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles
state court to conspiracy to force acts of prostitution and
served four months in the county jail. Today he is in the
fitness-equipment business in the Los Angeles area. He says
that, though he shared an office address with Mr. Conte, it
was for separate companies and that Mr. Conte wasn't involved
in the out-call business. "He was very nice to me," says Mr.
Tinerino. He adds that Mr. Conte tried to help him market
sound equipment to the movie business and that the producer
even introduced him to Mr. DeLaurentiis. "I never asked him
how he got into the movie business and he never talked about
what he did before the movie business," says Mr. Tinerino.
   Mr. Conte's jump into the big time in motion pictures came
in 1982, when he received his first producer credits, on
three movies. Two were DeLaurentiis productions, "Conan the
Barbarian" and "Fighting Back." The third, "48 Hours," was a
Paramount production.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney seemed
particularly interested in Mr. Conte's involvement in "48
Hours." A person familiar with the matter says the district
attorney's office was concerned how someone with Mr. Conte's
background could gain such a prominent role on a major movie.
   Two district attorney investigators eventually met with
Alan Croll, an outside attorney for Paramount, to deliver
what one person familiar with the meeting calls "a friendly
warning" to the studio about Mr. Conte. Over lunch at the
Playboy Club, the district attorney's men laid out Mr.
Conte's criminal past and suggested Paramount might want to
do its own review of the producer, says this person. Mr.
Croll thanked them for the information but never got back to
the investigators, this person adds. Mr. Croll declines to
comment on the meeting.
   The movie "48 Hours" would prove a big hit for Mr. Conte
and for its co-star, Nick Nolte. By all accounts, Mr. Nolte
and Mr. Conte are very close friends, and the producer at
times acts as an unofficial agent for the actor. Matt Cimber,
a local television producer, says Mr. Conte once told him,
"if I ever got anything good for Nick {in the way of scripts}
to get it over to him right away."
   During these years, Mr. Conte was also getting to know
people such as Donald Simpson. Mr. Simpson is currently one
of Hollywood's hottest producers, thanks to big-hit credits
such as "Top Gun," "Flashdance" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Mr.
Simpson was the head of production at Paramount in the early
1980s, and it was back then that he allegedly went to Mr.
Conte seeking help in a dispute with a man named Martin
Bacow.
   The 68-year-old Mr. Bacow freely admits to having known
organized-crime figures for most of his life, though he
insists he has never been involved in illegal activities. He
has also been under federal investigation over whether he
used organized-crime and union ties to extort money from
movie companies in return for labor peace -- a charge he
denies.
   Mr. Bacow says in an interview that in the early 1980s he
was doing work at Paramount when he and Mr. Simpson had a
falling out over business issues. Mr. Bacow claims that Mr.
Simpson was sufficiently worried that he sought protection
from Mr. Conte.
   Mr. Bacow says he first learned of the alleged meeting
between Messrs. Simpson and Conte from two members of the Los
Angeles police organized-crime unit he knew. "They told me
they had gone to see Simpson and that he admitted it. He said
he was afraid I was going to have him killed," says Mr.
Bacow, who adds that the fear was unfounded.
   One of those police officials, David Powers, confirms that
he and his partner did interview Mr. Simpson and, separately,
Mr. Eisner, who was Mr. Simpson's boss at the time. Mr.
Powers says police department rules preclude him from
discussing either meeting. Mr. Simpson, through a spokesman,
declined to be interviewed. Mr. Eisner, through a spokesman,
says that he "vaguely" recalls the meeting and that "it had
something to do with Mr. Simpson and a threat."
   Mr. Bacow says that, in a later confrontation, Mr. Simpson
admitted to him that he went to Mr. Conte for help. Two
people who say they witnessed that confrontation essentially
back up Mr. Bacow's account. Through his lawyer, Mr. Conte
says such a meeting with Mr. Simpson never occurred.
   Word of law-enforcement interest in Mr. Conte appeared in
a June 1983 Los Angeles Times article headlined "Police
Investigate Producer; He Calls It Mistaken Identity." In his
interview in the Times, Mr. Conte suggested there must be
another man named Conte with the criminal associations. The
Times quoted Mr. Conte as saying, "I'm not part of no Mafia.
Ask anybody you want in this town. I haven't done nothing to
nobody."
   The article also quoted Mr. Simpson as saying that Mr.
Conte had been instrumental in getting Mr. Nolte for "48
Hours" and quoted Mr. Eisner as saying Mr. Conte appeared to
be "in the mainstream of the motion picture business."
   Mr. Jordan, the private investigator, says the Times
article was a setback to Mr. Conte's career. The studios told
Mr. Conte "they felt they couldn't deal with him until the
controversy died down," says Mr. Jordan. When it did, the
deals started up again, he adds.
   In one of his letters to this newspaper, Mr. Sigel, the
producer's attorney, says the Journal's inquiries in recent
months are also damaging Mr. Conte's career. Mr. Conte has
been put on an industry "blacklist" where "his access to
production and distribution outlets has been curtailed and in
some instances denied," Mr. Sigel says. The lawyer didn't
elaborate.
   Yet if Hollywood does have Mr. Conte on a blacklist, it
doesn't appear to have affected his career. Recently, Daily
Variety columnist Army Archerd wrote that Mr. Conte has three
new movies in the works. Disney would distribute one.
Paramount is reportedly considering distributing another. And
Mr. Nolte would star in all three.

ANN CONWAY: THE 1980S: A LITERAL GLITZ BLITZ

Orange County society won't be crying in their Dom Perignon when they say "see 
ya" to the '80s. It's been a vintage decade for the glitz-set. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the Orange County Performing Arts Center opened in 1986, giving 
the glitterati a stylish new way to spend an evening: First, they dress to 
kill. Then, they dine at an A-list bistro near the Center (usually Antonello), 
watch a performance at Segerstrom Hall and then party till the wee hours at a 
nearby hot spot (usually the posh and private Center Club.). 
</P>
<P>
We're still shaking our heads in disbelief. Clothing vendor Amen Wardy 
installed a ballroom, complete with crystal chandeliers, in his maze-like 
boutique in Newport Center Fashion Island. Its opening-night bash in 1984 saw 
sexy Joan Collins, dripping in spangles, and then-husband Peter Holm ogling 
designer wear while party guests ogled them. In recent years, Wardy's showplace 
has been the site of Orange County's most-talked-about luncheon-fashion show, 
the one annually sponsored by Angelitos de Oro, a support group of Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County. Regularly on the guest list: members of 
the international society set such as fashion superstars Oscar de la Renta and 
Bob Mackie. 
</P>
<P>
Something we loved to see disappear in the '80s: the canopy of blue smoke that 
used to hang like a rain cloud over a ballroom while a party was in progress. 
Now, smoking cigarettes during a bash precipitates "who let you in?" stares. 
Polite guests puff outdoors. Ashtrays are rarely found on party tables. 
</P>
<P>
Something we hated to see appear in the '80s: "The valet stomp," the 
itchy-twitchy dance step party-goers execute post-party time, while they wait 
for their Jags, Rollses, Ferraris and Mercedeses. Some hotels have valet 
parking only (tsk tsk). And some hotels need to hire more valets. 
</P>
<P>
Now that you're primed for looking back, grab that Mont Blanc pen. It's time to 
take the 1989 Society Trivia Quiz, the end-of-the-season game that tests your 
social IQ. Now don't go kicking your secretary in the shins if you miss a few. 
You were probably so busy kicking up your heels, you didn't have time to read 
this column. But if you get them all right, something is dreadfully wrong. 
You've got to get out more, stop being the voyeur. (Answers below.)

   President Bush on Saturday night joined in a
dinner where U.S. Lebanese and Syrian charities honored John Sununu,
and praised his feisty chief of staff as `` a class act.''
   In a quick trip out of the White House and back, Bush dropped by
the black-tie dinner where Sununu was feted by a ballroom full of
guests, including another American of Lebanese descent, entertainer
Danny Thomas.
   The dinner was hosted by a favorite charity of Thomas', the St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the American-Lebanese-Syrian
Associated Charities.
   In brief remarks, Bush told the group that he has ``deep
affection for Lebanon,'' and mentioned the country's longstanding
political turmoil.
   ``I have been there many times as a private citizen before I got
involved in public life. And I expect every American looks at
Lebanon today with agony in his heart and concern hoping that he or
she in some way can find a way to make a difference. And I just
wanted you to know that as president, I want to find a way,'' Bush
said.
   As for Sununu, who has taken some lumps for a few rough spots
early in the Bush administration, Bush said he has learned a lot
about his top aide.
   ``He is a class act,'' Bush said.
   He congratulated the gathering for honoring Sununu.
   Joining Thomas and Sununu on the dais was United Press
International White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who is also of
Lebanese descent.
   Bush plucked the 49-year-old Sununu from the governor's chair in
New Hampshire to be his chief of staff at the White House. Sununu
was a top campaign adviser to Bush last year.
   A former engineer, he served as governor from 1983 until joining
the Bush administration.

Sue McDougall's husband and mother had just suffered strokes when the family 
moved to the quiet hillside neighborhood along Bastanchury Road 2 1/2 years 
ago, so the quaint, terra-cotta roofed hospital just up the block gave her 
peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt comfort being able to walk to a hospital if there was an emergency," 
said McDougall, who does not drive. "I used to brag about it." 
</P>
<P>
She's not bragging any more. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, McDougall and many other residents who live around the old St. Jude 
Hospital site live in fear over the ongoing conversion of the facility into a 
psychiatric hospital that will treat depression and other mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid of people with severe mental problems being in an area like this 
with children and three schools nearby," McDougall said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have signed a petition opposing the conversion of the old 
hospital in the 16000 block of Bastanchury Road. On Saturday, about a 
half-dozen hospital opponents picketed in front of the facility during an open 
house organized to alleviate concerns and attended by more than 100 residents. 
</P>
<P>
At the last Yorba Linda City Council meeting, residents opposed to the 
psychiatric hospital asked the council to do what it could to block to 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have written letters to local schools and churches concerning the 
project and plan to take the issue back to the council, said Steven Brunette, 
who lives a few blocks from the site. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said there is little Yorba Linda can do to block the opening 
of the 80-bed facility, scheduled for mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
Because state law prohibits cities from making distinctions between psychiatric 
facilities and other types of hospitals, the conversion does not violate the 
conditional use permit granted when the facility was a general hospital, 
according to Phillip Paxton, community development director. 
</P>
<P>
First word of the conversion came in early November when the hospital, on the 
corner of Bastanchury Road and Rose Drive, was sold by Orange-based St. Joseph 
Health System to National Medical Enterprises of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
NME runs 61 psychiatric hospitals across the United States, including the Los 
Altos Hospital and Health Center in Long Beach, according to Sandra L. 
Horowitz, vice president for development at Specialty Hospital Group, an NME 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
St. Jude closed its doors Nov. 14, when preparations began for the conversion 
to the new Yorba Hills Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Mesa, administrator at both Los Altos and Yorba Hills hospitals, said 
the facility will treat people who suffer from depression, chemical dependency 
and eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Patients stay at the hospital an average of 22 days and go through treatment 
programs that include therapy sessions, education programs, family visits and 
the prescription of some drugs under the supervision of a physician, he said. 
Treatment fees run at about $600 a day, not including professional fees, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of our patients, this is a timeout," Mesa said. "It's a time to sort 
out their lives." 
</P>
<P>
But many residents who live around Yorba Hills say their lives will be filled 
with anxiety if the conversion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Cosper, who regularly walks her dog past the hospital, said she 
couldn't believe it when she learned the site was going to be turned into a 
mental health center. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally obvious that it is not secure. I can't see how it can be 
properly secured," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While Cosper and other residents agree there is need for such a facility, they 
question the wisdom of placing patients who could be unpredictable and in some 
cases even violent in a suburban setting around homes and schools. They are 
also concerned about patients who have just been released from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone wanted to get out of that hospital quickly, they would get off the 
main street and onto a cul-de-sac," McDougall said. 
</P>
<P>
While Yorba Hills will have door alarms and a security guard, Mesa said the 
hospital will be just as concerned about restricting bad elements from entering 
the hospital as keeping the patients inside. 
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that seriously ill or violent people are kept out of the 
hospital by a strict admissions process that screens more patients out than it 
allows in. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a state hospital or a jail," Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials and at least one councilman believed the Saturday open house 
and tour helped residents feel more comfortable about their new neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a facility that every modern community in the 20th Century 
needs," said Councilman Irwin M. Fried, who attended the Saturday open house 
where he fielded questions from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said they walked away from the open house feeling that the 
facility would not harm their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of questions answered. They satisfied me," said resident Bob 
Stewart.

Survival rates for a common type of childhood cancer improved markedly at a 
leading medical center after doctors started using chemotherapy more 
aggressively, a study showed last week. 
</P>
<P>
In findings presented at the Society for Pediatric Research's annual meeting, 
Dr. Laura Bowman of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., 
said the overall four-year survival rate for neuroblastoma has improved from 
37% to 55% during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Neuroblastoma, which originates in the adrenal gland or nerve tissue near the 
spinal cord, is the most common childhood solid tumor after brain tumors, 
Bowman noted. If the cancer is not caught in its early stages, it often spreads 
to the lymph nodes, liver, bone and bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, doctors sometimes have been reluctant to rush childhood cancer 
patients into chemotherapy because of possible toxic side effects. But about 10 
years ago, St. Jude doctors started using several "front line" chemotherapy 
drugs on neuroblastoma patients as soon as possible, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the four-year survival rate for children younger than 1 year 
old -- whose disease is often not as advanced as in older youngsters -- has 
climbed from 48% to 89%, the doctor said.

petition, city officials postponed the hearing until June 3. That was a wise
and prudent decision.;    The policy question facing Cupertino officials is
whether to grant St. Jude's a burial permit based on existing land use
practices.;    Because St. Jude's is seeking a change -- the addition of a
cemetery where none now exists -- it is compelled to make a good case, one
that ought to address the burial site's effect on the lives of its
Chinese-American neighbors.;    The underlying predicament is how to balance
one group's religious values with another group's in a constructive manner.;  
 Representatives from both communities have the obligation to meet, try to
understand each other's views and search for a solution.;    Cupertino city
hall can help by bringing them together next week to avoid a confrontation on
June 3.;    Frankly, we don't know how to untangle things, but it's important
to try. A major challenge facing Santa Clara County is resolving differences
among neighbors with diverse beliefs.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Court Says Federal Judges May Be Disqualified From Presiding Over
Some Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal judges may be disqualified from
presiding over cases even when they are unaware during trial of
their personal connection to the cases, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Louisiana, the court said the
appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for a judge to
disqualify himself from presiding.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said even if a
judge is unaware of a possible conflict while presiding over a case
he later should disqualify himself when he learns of his connection.
   The judge's initial lack of knowledge of the possible conflict
``does not eliminate the risk that his impartiality might
reasonably be questioned by other persons,'' Stevens said.
   In such instances, the judge ``is called upon to rectify an
oversight and to take the steps necessary to maintain public
confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary,'' Stevens said.
   The case stems from a dispute over ownership of a hospital
corporation. It began in 1981 when Health Services Acquisition
Corp. filed a federal lawsuit against John Liljeberg over ownership
of a corporation known as St. Jude Hospital of Kenner, La.
   St. Jude Hospital had a state certificate of approval to build a
new facility.
   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Collins ruled on March 16, 1982,
in favor of Liljeberg.
   But the following year Health Services Acquisition learned that
Collins was a member of the board of trustees of Loyola University,
which had been negotiating with Liljeberg to sell him property for
a new hospital.
   Liljeberg's ability to build the hospital depended on his
success in obtaining the St. Jude certificate of approval.
   Health Services Acquisition went back to court seeking to
disqualify Collins and throw out his ruling that favored Liljeberg.
   Collins refused to disqualify himself. But the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court overruled him and threw out the judgment favoring Liljeberg.
   In upholding the appeals court ruling, the Supreme Court said
Collins should have disqualified himself when he became aware of
his connection to the case even though he had a temporary memory
lapse about his ties during the trial.
   Dissenting today were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The case is Liljeberg vs. Health Services Acquisition., 86-957.

four-year survival for blacks increased from 40 to 70 percent; for adolescents
it rose from 35 to 65 percent and for infants it rose from 23 to 50 percent.; 
  "These are the best results we've ever had," Rivera said.;    ALL is the
most common childhood cancer, affecting white blood cells known as
lymphocytes. It's diagnosed in about 2,000 American youngsters annually.;   
"Taken together, these interim findings suggest that our investigational

research concluded.;    Similar results have been reported by researchers in
Germany and at Boston's Dana Farber Cancer Institute.;    Patients required
little hospitalization during the treatment. Rivera said that makes it ideal
for use outside of high-tech medical centers.  </TEXT>

THE INNOCENT (18) John Schlesinger
SHOPPING (18) Paul Anderson
BEVERLY HILLS COP 3 (15) John Landis
ROBOCOP 3 (15) Fred Dekker
The tug-of-war custody hearing over the British film industry continues this
week, with important new testimony from both sides.
The evidence produced on behalf of the first party, Mr America, is the movie
Shopping. Paul Anderson's urban thriller - a loud, dark-toned, pacy British
film made in the style of that currently popular retro-genre, 'film noir' -
will be used to show that Hollywood has been powerfully influential in the
forming of modern UK screen culture.
But Miss Europe, who was of course Mr America's common-law partner until a
recent quarrel involving a Gatt, will claim that John Schlesinger's The
Innocent proves the opposite: that this version of Ian McEwan's Cold War
novel set in moody murder-prone Berlin shows that the last best hope for
British film is an alliance with our friends across the Channel. Look at the
evidence. Exhibit A: British director and leading man (Anthony Hopkins).
Exhibit B: Italian leading lady (Isabella Rossellini). Exhibit C: German
locations and co-funding.
Each side is then expected to attack the other mercilessly for its poor
record of care and guardianship. Mr America will accuse Miss Europe of
involving Britain in the deadly quagmire of the 'Euro-pudding' and will
point out certain specific shortcomings in The Innocent. Its peculiar
compote casting, for starters. Why is Sir Anthony Hopkins playing an
American army officer - with an appalling sub-James Cagney accent - while
America's Campbell Scott (better accented) plays the young British telephone
engineer Leonard, brought to Berlin in 1955 to help with an anti-Soviet
surveillance scheme?
McEwan's novel was a bizarre blend of Le Carre spy stuff with sex, passion
and murder. When Leonard falls for the German Maria (played in the film by
the Italian Miss Rossellini), a nasty encounter with her husband ends in
death and dismemberment. 'What will the lovers do with the body?' becomes
the novel's big question, until finally the object is folded cunningly,
ironically into the espionage plot.
Schlesinger's film is best when most intimate. Scott excels as the fussy,
virginal communications boffin marooned in a cut-off world - his dingy love
nest - with the distraught, high-strung girl and the carnage she brings him.
But whenever the film moves out into the 'real' world, all reality ceases.
Schlesinger promises much with a virtuoso opening tracking shot through a
crowded, babbling hotel lobby. But then the individual voices start.
Hopkins's 'You dirdy rat' American; a number of German supporting actors
dubbed into transatlantic; and finally Miss R herself, who is fine right up
to the last scene when she too is tipped into the open air. Her scene of
foggy-voiced tearful parting on a foggy airfield seems like a crazed reprise
of her mother's finest hour in Casablanca.
After Mr America has had his say about The Innocent, and the mish-mash of
vagabond ingredients typical of Euro-puddings, Miss Europe will have her say
about Shopping. She will attack the delinquent tendencies of an ex-colonial
culture based on the worship of crime and violence. Shopping which stars
Sadie Frost and Jude Law as two car-stealing 'ram-raiders,' who like to
enter shops through the shop window, is, she will point out, like Bonnie And
Clyde meets Absolute Beginners, possibly over the prone body of Blade
Runner.
Over-the-top visual atmospherics - mist and smoke, Stygian chiaroscuro,
drizzle-haloed street lights - are wedded to daft script-lines. The exchange
earning the largest giggle at the press show came when Mr Law ventures to
plant a tentative kiss on Miss Frost's lips and she says 'Cut it, Joe, this
is the 90s. Sex isn't safe anymore.' Nor, in the wrong hands, is portentous
epochal dialogue. The film is a second-rate, second-hand thriller in debt,
far beyond repayment, to its Hollywood paradigms.
The judge presiding over the custody hearing will admit that he finds this
case difficult to resolve. Each side, America and Europe, has powerful
arguments concerning the decrepit artistic standards of the other. After
long consideration, though, he has made his decision. He will award custody
to neither party. He will instead urge and if necessary compel the British
film industry to become self-reliant. For a short time it will be made a
ward of court. Then it will be required to make its own way in the world
with no more than a minimal reliance on any other nation.
It will not be allowed to beg at Number Ten Downing Street, nor to spend its
life creeping towards the EC or US for cultural resuscitation. Soon rather
than late it must learn how to please and interest other cultures and
societies, without compromising its own culture or treating its own society
as a charity institute.
After all (sums up the judge), if Four Weddings And A Funeral and The Crying
Game and A Fish Called Wanda and My Beautiful Laundrette can do it, so can
everyone else. Case dismissed.
In the week of Beverly Hills Cop 3 and Robocop 3, what better time to
distance ourselves from Hollywood? When sequel sagas hit stage three, three
things happen. Script invention plummets. Plots reach for tortured novelties
of location or motivation: in BHC3 a theme park, in R3 a whole lot of
inner-city anarchy requiring emergency policing. And favourite actors drop
out.
So no Peter Weller as Robocop. His lips and jaw - nothing else being visible
below the hydraulically whining visor - are replaced by those of Robert
Burke. And over in Beverly Hills no John Ashton, who for two films played
fat-solemn police sidekick (alongside tall-slim Judge Reinhold) to Eddie
Murphy's grinning dementia praecox case from Detroit.
Mr Murphy has now been seconded to California so often that we wonder why he
does not keep a hotel room there. Beverly Hills Cop 3 is an exhausted replay
of the old tics. Its desperation is most evident in the wheeling forth of
Bronson Pinchot, who stole Cop 1 with his fluttery, shrieking art gallery
owner and who is asked to do it again here - no, to overdo it - so that he
becomes victim rather than saviour.
Robocop 3 features another cop called Murphy (hero's name not performer's)
and also begins in Detroit. But this film has the sense to stay there. Here
is the much-loved Motown sound: not Diana Ross but the music of crashing
cars, screaming extras and our hero's bullet-zapping bio-metallic arms. Here
too, for 20 minutes of tolerable reacquaintance, is Hollywood's attempt to
force the futurist vision of Lang's Metropolis into intimacy with the
weaponry of the Star Wars era. Then, like the other film, it tailspins into
diminishing circles.
Should they not have combined the two trequels and given us Beverly Hills
Robocop? That way familiarity could have been spiced with hybridisation. And
we would have warmed to the idea of a knockabout black cop clamped in a
head-to-toe metal casing from which only the best wisdoms and witticisms
would be allowed to emerge.

150 TO TEST BLOOD TO HELP AILING TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 150 employees of St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center will 
undergo blood tests today to determine if their bone marrow is compatible with 
that of Brandon Oba, a 16-year-old suffering from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say the youth, son of hospital employee Steve Oba, needs a bone marrow 
transplant if he is to have any hope of a healthy life. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the blood tests will be performed from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Hospital employees, volunteers and members of the medical staff have 
volunteered to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the possibility of finding a "matching" donor is 1 in 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the blood test is $75 per test, but St. Jude Hospital and 
Rehabilitation Center has agreed to pay the costs of the tests performed on 
their employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of those who have volunteered to be tested are very positive and upbeat," 
said Karen Murray, a hospital lab employee. "We're all hoping that one of us 
will be able to help Brandon."

KYLANDER FLOWERS AT CSUN AFTER HIGH SCHOOL BURNOUT

<P>
Jude Kylander can safely lay claim to the title of fastest woman swimmer at the 
NCAA Division II championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
She already has anchored three victorious relay teams and won an individual 
title in the 50-yard freestyle sprint. 
</P>
<P>
And her favorite race, the 100-yard freestyle, is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
But as fast as she is in the water, she was even more of a blur on foot one 
October day in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
You think FloJo can fly? Too bad there wasn't a stopwatch on Kylander, a born 
and bred Pennsylvanian, the first time the light fixtures in her off-campus 
apartment started break-dancing to the tune of a California quake. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Kylander's older brother Fred was on a visit and was there to 
place the event in its proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to meet the neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They both did. Jude said that it was quite a while before they dared go back 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for an open field to go run in," she said. "Anything away from 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Kylander said that she was more frightened than her brother but "only because I 
could tell he was scared. Normally, nothing bothers him, so I figured if he was 
scared I should be even more." 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Northridge Coach Pete Accardy recalls, Kylander was still 
quaking even though the ground had long since stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me think about coming back home, let me tell ya," Kylander said. 
</P>
<P>
Home for the Kylanders is Warren, Pa., an oil and timber town of about 15,000 
less than 20 miles from the New York border. The area is not considered much of 
a swimming hotbed, which is why Jude, the youngest of four children, was sent 
packing as a high school junior in search of better training. 
</P>
<P>
Mercersburg Academy, a private boarding school in the mountainous southeastern 
part of the state, seemed to have the prescribed combination of aquatics and 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
It was the right choice for many -- Olympic backstroke specialist Betsey 
Mitchell went there, as did several other successful Division I swimmers. But 
it wasn't right for Kylander, who fizzled when faced with the demands of 
mega-mileage workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I got worse each year," Kylander said. "By the time I graduated, I wasn't even 
a contender to look at." 
</P>
<P>
So, while her high school teammates sorted scholarship offers from the likes of 
Tennessee and Texas, Kylander took to the road in search of a team. 
</P>
<P>
First stop: Orlando, Fla., site of the 1985 Division II nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I graduated that if I was going to continue swimming I had to be 
realistic," Kylander said. "I didn't want to just go try to hang on at some 
Division I school." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kylander, who had been a swimmer on strong Clarion State (Pa.) College 
teams, suggested Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"They were always an all-around class act," said Fred, who last swam for 
Clarion in 1982, a year in which CSUN won both the men's and women's national 
team championships. 
</P>
<P>
Clarion, Fred said, was not much of an option. In his two seasons of swimming 
there he suffered through the same type of burnout his sister had experienced 
in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I improved, but not in the leaps and bounds like kids who had been slower 
before they went to Northridge," Fred said. "When I swam against them I 
couldn't understand what kind of magic Accardy had. But I thought that is what 
Jude should have." 
</P>
<P>
No tricks involved, Accardy says. A shot of confidence was all that was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"She came from a good swimming school, but I don't think they worked with her 
head very much," Accardy said. "A lot of swimming coaches put so much stress on 
these kids from such a young age that they all go through plateaus. 
</P>
<P>
"We've picked up a lot of burned-out people and been able to work with them. 
All it is really is developing them emotionally rather than swim-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Although they are 3,000 miles apart, Kylander keeps close contact with her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kylander said that the family considers his sister's experience living in 
Southern California as valuable as the education she is receiving. 
</P>
<P>
"We come from a very small and conservative community," Fred said. "You only 
get so much from the books, then maybe 75% is out of life itself. There is no 
better place than Southern California to learn those lessons." 
</P>
<P>
There is no debating that Kylander's swimming has flourished. She has been 
among the elite of Division II sprinters for three years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her three individual championships, Kylander has been on 12 
title-winning relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
She has been a part of four record-setting relay teams. Northridge is the 
record-holder in the 200- and 800-yard freestyles and the 200- and 400-yard 
medleys. The 400-yard freestyle relay, which will be held today, is the only 
relay record that has eluded CSUN and Kylander. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a shot at it," Accardy said. 
</P>
<P>
The event will be the meet's last race. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a nice way for her to go out," Accardy said.

CRIME: DAVID RICKARD, A FORMER YOUTH COUNSELOR, MAINTAINS THAT HE IS INNOCENT 
OF 120 COUNTS OF ORAL COPULATION WITH A MINOR FILED IN TWO CITIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
With his steady blue eyes and boyish grin, the unswerving loyalty of his 
elderly parents and the comfort of their wood-beamed 1908 home as a backdrop, 
it's easy to believe David Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former youth pastor and counselor has a quietly self-confident 
demeanor that has helped him start youth groups and anti-drug abuse programs in 
several California communities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rickard is either a persuasive con man or he is innocent, as he insists, of 
120 counts of oral copulation with a minor filed against him in Redding and 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine one kid saying one thing, and you lose it all," Rickard said. "The 
people that know me don't believe that this stuff happened at all." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Gaul, the Shasta County deputy district attorney who prosecuted Rickard in 
Redding, has no problem believing "this stuff" happened, however. He thinks 
Rickard just has his supporters charmed. "The guy's kind of a charismatic 
person," Gaul said. "He's interesting to watch up on the stand. He gets this 
funny smile on his face, and he starts quoting from the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Rickard last year faced two separate trials on sex charges stemming from a 
homosexual relationship that he allegedly engaged in for more than 2 1/2 years 
with a teen-ager. The youth was 15 when he moved out of his parents' Glendale 
home and traveled in Rickard's company to Northern California. He was 17 when 
he returned home and told his parents that he had been involved sexually with 
Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Because the alleged relationship had occurred in two places, Redding 
authorities filed 110 charges of oral copulation with a minor, and Pasadena 
authorities filed 10. Both cases came to trial in 1989 and ended in hung 
juries, 9-3 for conviction in Redding and 11-1 in favor of conviction in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has steadfastly maintained he is innocent. During the trials, 10 young 
men, formerly troubled youths whom Rickard counseled, testified on his behalf, 
saying they were never sexually approached by Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are now preparing retrials. On Monday, a hearing is scheduled in 
Redding to set a trial date; Rickard's Pasadena retrial begins Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Before his legal troubles started, Rickard had moved frequently between 
Northern California and the San Gabriel Valley. Born and raised in Sierra 
Madre, he worked in area churches during the '70s, in Northern California in 
the early '80s, and by 1982, was back in the San Gabriel Valley, launching an 
anti-drug program called "Project Alert." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he moved back to Northern California accompanied by the youth who has 
since accused him. There, Rickard worked at a church and in group homes for 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
But since the charges were filed, he has given up the jobs in Northern 
California and moved back into his parents' home in Sierra Madre. He said he 
has racked up $90,000 in legal fees, and his parents have mortgaged their 
house. But he refuses to plea bargain, as was suggested by the judge in the 
Northern California case. 
</P>
<P>
"If I plea bargain, it's all over," said Rickard, who received degrees from Cal 
State LA and Pacific Oaks College, and attended the Melodyland School of 
Theology in Anaheim. "All my degrees are worthless, and I'm ruined for the rest 
of my life. I might as well be dead. I might as well be in the grave." 
</P>
<P>
But the family of the now-19-year-old remains equally firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We prayed about it, went to the pastor and decided that David worming his way 
into another family was never going to happen again," said the youth's father. 
"Obviously, David has led a Christian ministry, but he's got a flaw, and it's 
got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The father and son requested that their names not be used because of the young 
man's age at the time of the alleged sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
The cases have caused some churchgoers from the San Fernando and San Gabriel 
valleys to take sides. Among those siding with Rickard are some members of the 
Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Sierra Madre, which Rickard attended as a 
child in the company of his parents, Jane and Ken, Sierra Madre residents since 
1949. Rickard, who said he got interested in a career as a minister after 
attending a prayer meeting with a friend in 1975, once served as a volunteer 
youth worker at Ascension. 
</P>
<P>
A few longtime Sierra Madre residents also support Rickard. Among them is Don 
Dewey, 57, publisher of R-C Modeler and Fresh Water and Marine Aquarium 
magazines. Dewey said Rickard belonged to a group of young people who conducted 
Bible study classes at the Dewey home in the early 1980s. When Dewey's son, 
Michael, died in a 1982 motorcycle crash, Rickard stayed the night at the 
hospital and helped the family through the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey in turn aided Rickard in the pastor's unsuccessful 1982 bid for a Sierra 
Madre City Council seat. He also helped him launch Project Alert, an anti-drug 
program founded by Rickard in which Sierra Madre police dispatchers sent 
counselors to teens in need. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sierra Madre Police Chief Bill Betts now minimizes the department's 
affiliation with the program, Dewey and Rickard said the department officially 
sanctioned the project. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the other side are members of St. Jude's Episcopal Church in 
Burbank. It was at St. Jude's that Rickard, a youth pastor, met the young man 
and his family in 1984. Despite reservations by older, more conservative church 
members who objected to Rickard's long hair, the young man and his parents came 
to regard the hip youth pastor as a member of the family, said the father. 
</P>
<P>
With his pet macaws, BMW automobile, good stereo system and ability to "talk 
the lingo" of teen-agers, Rickard made the church's youth program flourish. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great deal of enthusiasm," the father said. "He had a charm and 
manner that drove teen-agers to him, especially teen-age boys." 
</P>
<P>
His son, then 14, began spending time with Rickard in Bible study sessions, the 
father said. When Rickard said he was moving to Northern California to work at 
the Little Country Church in Palo Cedro, the young man asked to go. 
</P>
<P>
The father said he consented to his son living away from home because of his 
trust in Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Only when the youth returned in 1987 and was questioned by his mother did the 
family discover the true nature of the relationship, the father said. They 
called Rickard to their house and he confessed, pleading with them not to 
expose him, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard insists that he only admitted a physical attraction to the boy, who, 
with blond hair and blue eyes, looked enough like him to be his child. "The 
physical aspect came in that (the young man) looked like my son," said Rickard, 
who is unmarried and has no children. "It was more of an emotional bonding that 
had taken place." 
</P>
<P>
After the confrontation with Rickard, the family went to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard, who said he has appeared on religious broadcasts on cable television 
in Northern California, has insisted that he is being persecuted by 
law-enforcement officials who view him as another Jim Bakker or Jimmy Swaggart. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors in Los Angeles and Shasta counties deny that, and they are 
determined to retry him. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's somebody in contact with lots of young people, and he abuses his 
position of trust," said Los Angeles Deputy District Atty. Robert de Carteret , 
the prosecutor in the Pasadena case. "The victim is not just a 15-year-old kid. 
The victim is everybody who sends their kid to church and the YMCA and those 
programs. They are all weakened by the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
The young man's parents also are determined, even though the retrials mean 
their son will have to take the stand against Rickard and give painful 
testimony for a third and fourth time. The youth, who received six months of 
counseling after he told his parents of the alleged sexual relationship, is now 
a college student with a grocery store job and a pregnant wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to go on with my life," the young man said recently. "I'd really 
like to see this over." 
</P>
<P>
Rickard is likewise determined to fight the charges, rebuild his life and stay 
in youth counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"My commitment to families and people hasn't changed," he said. "That's my 
life. That's what I do."

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: CLASS FOR GRANDPARENTS IS A TIME FOR FAMILY SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times, 57-year-old Bess Osterhues spreads herself out on the floor and 
pretends to go through labor pains. 
</P>
<P>
Her graphic position and simulated discomfort occur during the childbirth 
classes she teaches for parents. Considering that she has three children and 
has worked around babies all her adult life, Osterhues is pretty good at the 
re-creation. 
</P>
<P>
But these days Osterhues, the perinatal health coordinator at St. Jude Hospital 
in Fullerton, is also teaching a more mature group of people -- the 
grandparents. Although she isn't one herself, Osterhues knows all about that 
too. 
</P>
<P>
In her class, the registered nurse tells grandparents how the philosophy of 
raising a child has changed since they had their children, and what their 
children believe in and practice today. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the focus is not on the process of the birth but on the whole change in 
care," Osterhues said. "These days, we look at the whole family participating, 
and it has been fun developing a program that values and appreciates what each 
family member contributes." 
</P>
<P>
That practice, she added, includes having parents in the mother's hospital room 
during labor. 
</P>
<P>
Osterhues said she was able to observe some of the labor and delivery 
experiences of young women at the hospital. "Hopefully, I have learned the 
things that are important to them and the things they see as being helpful 
without being intrusive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her class attracts upward of 20 people for each session in the hospital's 
maternity wing, and the idea is for the grandparents, especially those who have 
had more than one grandchild, to share their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Grandparents are asked to remember some of the things that happened with their 
first child, said Osterhues, who became a registered nurse in 1954 and, at age 
45, went back to school to become a nurse practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she is studying for a master's degree in health education at Cal State 
Long Beach "to broaden the way I can look at health care and open my eyes to 
provide and help promote health care at (St. Jude) hospital." 
</P>
<P>
"In general, young couples are sensible and able to make their own decisions," 
she said, adding that young people have shown a renewed interest in sharing 
their thoughts and feelings with their own parents. 
</P>
<P>
"They remember their parents survived having children," Osterhues said. No 
doubt when her children have children, it will result in her being a superstar 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Guido, a 9 1/2-year-old German shepherd police dog who will officially retire 
from the Tustin Police Department on Feb. 1, was toasted at a retirement party 
at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
Cake and dog bones were served. 
</P>
<P>
And his handler, Officer Ron Frazier, who bought the dog from the city for $1 
and will keep him as a house pet, said Guido will also receive a proclamation 
for his 5 years of service at a City Council meeting where officials will 
congratulate him and shake his paw. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Monzo's love of comic books may turn into a career for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed reading comics for a long time," said the 21-year-old Costa Mesa 
man, who is learning printing and publishing skills at the North Orange County 
Regional Occupational Program. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of his Quad Star Comics firm, all 800 copies, will be 
distributed next month at 75 cents each. Monzo, a graduate of Loara High School 
in Anaheim, is the owner, writer and only employee of Quad Star Comics. But he 
said he has friends doing the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it gains a lot of interest and sells well so I can support myself," 
Monzo said. "It's a trial-and-error thing because there's no manual on how to 
get into the comic book business." 
</P>
<P>
His first comic book is called "Terror Syndrome," and the plot includes horror 
and violence. "I'd really like to make the next book more like old-time horror 
movies that were exciting, but never really showed much violence."

POLICE SHOOT SUSPECT AFTER FREEWAY CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
TWO IN STOLEN CAR CHASED BY OWNER, OFFICERS; WINDSHIELD OF WOMAN MOTORIST HIT 
BY BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An 18-year-old Anaheim man was in custody early Friday and a second suspect was 
at large after the two allegedly stole a car and led police on a frantic 
freeway chase that ended with a car crash and shots being fired, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase left the Anaheim man wounded from police gunfire. A passing motorist 
was slightly injured after a stray bullet shattered her windshield and sprayed 
her with fragments of glass, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Police Capt. Jim Oman said the incident began around 9:30 p.m. Thursday 
when two men confronted Linda Pinney of Brea as she drove her gold Acura Legend 
into her driveway on the 1400 block of Alta Mesa Way. One of the men yanked her 
from the car, struck her in the face, jumped into the driver's seat and then 
sped away in her car. The other man took off behind in a blue Nissan Maxima, 
Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband Chased Cars 
</P>
<P>
Pinney's husband was home at the time and saw the commotion. He ran to a pickup 
truck parked nearby and began the chase. 
</P>
<P>
The two cars made their way to the Orange Freeway and headed south at speeds of 
up to 100 m.p.h., Oman said. But the husband closed in and overtook the Acura 
in congested traffic near the Lambert Road exit in Brea. Oman said the husband 
jumped from the truck and immediately began beating the driver of the Acura. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief scuffle, the driver broke free and ran to the Nissan, jumped in 
and again sped away. The husband climbed into the Acura and continued the chase 
-- this time followed by police. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Yorba Linda Boulevard exit in Fullerton, the chase ended when the 
Nissan spun out of control and crashed into the freeway's center divider. The 
husband stopped the Acura in front of the car, but this time stayed inside the 
vehicle, Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police shot Jay Le of Anaheim once in the left shoulder as he jumped from the 
Nissan and flashed what an officer thought was a gun, Oman said. Officers later 
found a toy gun in the car, but did not find a real weapon, he said. The 
officer who fired, whose name is being withheld, was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Police said during the gunfire a stray bullet shattered the windshield of a car 
driven by 19-year-old Terry Susan Notthoff of West Covina, who was passing by. 
Notthoff suffered minor injuries from broken glass and was taken to St. Jude 
Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton, where she was treated for her 
injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Police Lt. Chet Panique said that whenever traffic or pedestrians are 
present, officers are told to use discretion in deciding whether to shoot at a 
fleeing suspect or to hold their fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I just believe it would be putting them in too much jeopardy to tell them they 
couldn't shoot on the freeway or congested areas," Panique said. "A lot of it 
boils down to common sense and taking the factors into consideration. . . . But 
of course the officer is held accountable for the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Man Escaped 
</P>
<P>
After being wounded, Le, 18, allegedly ran across the freeway and hopped a wall 
into the Homestead Apartments on Deerpark Drive. The other suspect ran across 
the freeway in the opposite direction and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Davis, a resident of the complex, said he was on his way home from work 
when he heard shots and saw a man scale the wall and run into the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"First I thought maybe it was an auto accident," Davis said, "so I stopped the 
car and got out. As I was walking back I saw this guy hop the freeway wall and 
start running through our complex, but I didn't think he did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he saw two police helicopters hovering over the dimly lit complex in 
search of the suspect. In the meantime, the fugitive climbed into a nearby 
dumpster, but was seen by other residents, who alerted police. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine said he knew where (the suspect) was hiding," said Davis, a 
junior at nearby Cal State Fullerton. "He said he was inside this dumpster, but 
we didn't want to look in because police said he still had a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Oman said a police dog was sent into the dumpster and found Le, unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Le was treated at the scene for his gunshot wound, along with some cuts and 
bruises, and was taken to St. Jude hospital in Fullerton. He was listed Friday 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Le was held at the hospital on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a 
police officer, armed robbery and grand theft auto. His bail is set at $50,000.

   Paul McCartney says his better relations with other
former Beatles has made it possible for him to play the legendary
group's songs in public again.
   ``My relations with former members of the band have improved.
Those songs are wonderful memories for me and that is why I am
playing them again,'' he told reporters Tuesday before his Rome
concert, part of a world tour promoting his latest album ``Flowers
in the Dirt.''
   Those songs include ``Can't Buy Me Love,'' ``Eleanor Rigby,''
``Back in the USSR,'' ``Hey Jude'' and ``Yesterday,'' which he

   A 17-year-old high school senior will
preside as queen of the 101st Tournament of Roses on New Year's Day.
   ``My reaction was very surprised, and I'm very excited,''
Yasmine Begum Delawari said Tuesday after she was named by Don W.
Fedde, president of the Tournament of Roses Association.
   Miss Delawari, a Pasadena area resident, was chosen from seven
finalists who constitute the tournament's royal court. The queen
and six attendants were chosen from more than 800 applicants
following four interviews, said Kristin Mabry Tranquada, a
tournament spokeswoman.
   Judges made their selections based on the candidates' public
speaking ability, poise, academic achievement and personality.
   ``This is the start of a new century for the Tournament of
Roses, so I just plan to do the best I can to represent them,''
said Miss Delawari, who hopes to attend the University of
California, Los Angeles.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton says he wants to
get back to running the state after a judge issued a no-fault
divorce award ending his 23-year marriage to former Miss America
runner-up Dee Caperton.
   The governor didn't attend Monday's brief proceedings during
which Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Herman Canady approved the
divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.
   The action halted a tandem $12 million fraud suit Mrs. Caperton
had filed in federal court against the governor and two others.
   ``I'm pleased to have it behind us,'' the governor said in a
statement. ``I think it's time to move forward.''
   No details were released on the settlement, but Mrs. Caperton's
attorney, Stanley Preiser, said as he left Canady's office: ``Both
cases have been settled. Everybody's happy and she's extremely
satisfied.''
   ``You can underline extremely,'' Mrs. Caperton added.
   In July, Mrs. Caperton filed for divorce and in August followed
it up with her fraud suit, alleging she had been duped into selling
her stock in the family insurance business for $2.98 million when
the stock was worth far more.

   The Who, The Four Tops, the Four Seasons, the
Kinks, the Platters, Hank Ballard, Bobby Darin and Simon and
Garfunkel have been selected for induction Jan. 17 to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.
   The selections bring to 43 the number of recording acts chosen
for the hall and represent ``a good cross section'' of musical
style, rock historian Norm N. Nite said Tuesday. It also represents
an effort to honor people long overdue for recognition, he added.
   ``We're trying to get caught up on a lot of people owed getting
in. As years go by, it will get tighter and tighter,'' said Nite,
who has two syndicated radio rock 'n' roll oldies shows.
   Besides the recording artists, three ``early influencers'' were
selected to be honored at the as-yet unbuilt hall of fame and
museum _ jazz singer-trumpeter Louis Armstrong, jazz guitarist
Charlie Christian and blues pioneer Ma Rainey.
   Two songwriting teams will be inducted in the non-performing
music industry category, although some have been important
performers as well. The writers include the teams of Brian Holland,
Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland, and Gerry Goffin and Carole King.

   Hockey's great one was escorted down Main
Street U.S.A. by the squeaky one, the incoherent one and the goofy
one as the Magic Kingdom paid tribute to Wayne Gretzky.
   Gretzky, 28, wife Janet Jones and their 10-month-old daughter
participated in a parade Tuesday to the Town Square Train Station.
Also in the parade were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy,
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said.
   Disney has produced many commercials featuring athletes who have
just won a Super Bowl or World Series saying they plan to go to
Disneyland next, but Roth said there are no plans to ask Gretzky,
`` ... what are you going to do now?''
   The Los Angeles Kings' center last week became the National
Hockey League's all-time scoring champion, eclipsing Gordie Howe's
record.
   ``This is special in that with most honors you get a trophy or a
plaque and you can just enjoy those by yourself,'' Gretzky said.
``But this way I can enjoy the day with my wife and daughter. Just
to spend the day here is quite an honor.''

   Norman Vincent Peale, whose ``The Power of
Positive Thinking'' is the best-selling non-fiction book in
history, reached another milestone with the dedication here of the
Center for Positive Thinking.
   Among the 1,000 people taking part in the ceremony Friday were
television personality Art Linkletter, chairman of the center's
fund-raising committee, and former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown and
his wife, Phyllis George, a former Miss America.
   The two-story building houses offices, an auditorium, seminar
rooms, a library and a recording studio. It will serve as a
repository for the documents, sermons, books, articles, photographs
and recordings pertaining to Peale's work.
   Peale, who turns 90 on Tuesday, is a minister and the author of
35 books. ``The Power of Positive Thinking,'' published in 1952,
has sold 15 million copies worldwide.
   Peale and his wife, Ruth Stafford Peale, established the
Foundation for Christian Living 48 years ago. For the past 66
years, Peale has lectured and written about personal motivation.

   Comedians Milton Berle, Sid Caesar and
Danny Thomas joined other celebrities and officials in dedicating a
new 1,000-room addition to the Riviera Hotel and Casino, a
33-year-old fixture on the Las Vegas Strip.
   Gov. Richard Bryan presented plaques to the three comics, who
are appearing together at the resort in a Memorial Day weekend show
billed ``The Living Legends of Comedy.''
   Berle recalled playing the hotel when it opened in 1955. At the
time, it was dubbed a ``nine-story skyscraper'' and was one of only
a handful of hotels on a section of the highway that was becoming
known as ``The Strip.''
   The hotel's newest addition gives it a total of more than 2,500
rooms.
   Hotel owner Meshulam Riklis was on hand for Friday's dedication
along with his wife, singer and actress Pia Zadora.
   Ms. Zadora was honored by Thomas for a concert she gave in Las
Vegas earlier this year that raised $250,000 for St. Jude's
Hospital, the children's hospital Thomas helped found.

   It may not be easy, but Mayor Edward I. Koch
says he plans to follow his doctor's orders and avoid sunbathing
after he had five non-cancerous lesions removed from his face.
   Koch said three of the lesions were caused by exposure to the
sun and the other two were from an inherited condition.
   ``They are common and benign lesions,'' Koch said.
   He said dermatologist Richard Green gave him a local anesthetic
and removed the lesions in about 20 minutes Friday. He said no
further medical treatment was required.
   However, he said, Green advised him to avoid prolonged exposure
to the sun.
   ``I have always believed it is a good idea to follow doctor's
orders. But as we begin what promises to be a beautiful and bright
Memorial Day weekend, it may not be easy to do,'' he said.

   Reasoner, a correspondent for ``60 Minutes,'' has seven children
from a previous marriage, which ended in divorce, Brunett said.
Reasoner and Ms. Weber, who also was previously married, live in
Westport, Conn., he said.

   More than 2,300 fans gave American soprano Kathleen
Battle a warm reception as she made her international debut with
the New York Metropolitan Opera as Susanna in ``The Marriage of
Figaro.''
   Miss Battle, arguably the best-known female opera singer in
Japan, delighted the audience with a rousing performance Friday
alongside bass John Cheek as Figaro.
   Her reception, however, was cooler than when the Met opened
Wednesday with Placido Domingo in the lead role of ``The Tales of
Hoffman.''
   Domingo earned hearty bravos and eight curtain calls for
Hoffman, which marked the beginning of the Met's first tour outside
North America in 13 years.
   Nevertheless, Friday's audience in the 2,303-seat Tokyo Cultural
Hall called the cast and musical director James Levine back for
five curtain calls. The Met is on a three-week tour of Japan. Miss
Battle alternates appearances in ``Figaro'' with another soprano,
Hong Hei-kyung.
   Miss Battle's popularity in Japan stems partly from her
appearance in television and magazine ads for Nikka Whiskey.

   Socialite-turned-social-activist Pat
Montandon is auctioning her hard-to-sell $4.9 million penthouse on
the city's chic Russian Hill.
   ``She got to the point where it's time to sell,'' Margie Crowe,
head of the auction division for Merrill Lynch Realty, said
Thursday in announcing the June 25 auction. ``She feels she can get
wider exposure doing it this way.''
   Montandon founded and runs Children as the Peacemakers
Foundation, which seeks to improve relations between the United
States and Soviet Union through an exchange program for children of
the two nations. When the auction was announced, she was in the
Soviet Union for activities connected to the Reagan-Gorbachev
summit.
   Some of the proceeds from the sale of the elegant home will be
donated to the foundation, Crowe said. The foundation also will
benefit from the sale of an assortment of Montandon's belongings,
including furs, a 16th century tapestry, jewels and crystal.

<HL> OTC Focus: Rumors Whip Through Dull Session, Tossing Some Issues Way Up, Some Down </HL>

<TEXT>
   Amid lackluster trading in the over-the-counter market yesterday, rumors abounded, sending prices of some issues sharply up and others sharply down. 

   OTC traders say dull markets often generate waves of rumors, which tend to proliferate when some OTC investors or traders get bored with the lack of activity. 

   Yesterday, St. Jude Medical, for example, slid 2 to 24 5/8 on rumors that David Duclof, a Dain Bosworth analyst, had dropped his earnings estimates for the medical equipment company as well as his recommendation. 
He was out of town. 

   By the time Mr. Duclof could be located and his response put out over the Minneapolis brokerage firm's wire it was afternoon and the stock had hit Nasdaq's most-active list, down 2 1/4. 
"St. 
Jude Medical is weak today on a misunderstanding," was his response. 
"Buy on the weakness," he urged investors, emphasizing that he still considered St. Jude a strong "buy." 

   More OTC issues rose in price yesterday than fell. 
About 1,081 stocks advanced in price, compared with 978 that declined. 
But advancers and decliners each accounted for about 33 million of the 107 million shares that traded yesterday. 
Issues that didn't change in price accounted for the rest. 

   But because small and medium-sized issues generally did better than the giant OTC issues traded by institutions yesterday, the Nasdaq 100 Index, which is the closest of the OTC indexes to the Dow Jones Industrials, fell 0.6%, or 1.87 points, to 316.18. 
Even so, the biggest issues on the National Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation service did better yesterday than those in the Dow, which was dragged down by disappointing special earnings gains reported by IBM. 

   The Nasdaq composite index fell fractionally, by 0.17 points, to 340.36. 

   Among some of yesterday's middle-sized winners, Standard Microsystems, a computer hardware manufacturer with stock currently valued at about $85 million in the marketplace, rose 1 1/8 to 8 on a $9-a-share cash tender offer for its stock. 
And a few similar-sized computer and software issues rose in price. 
Cronus Industries, which makes a computerized system for recording and tabulating votes in elections, rose 3/4 to 13 3/4 on 143,900 shares. 

   Individuals were fairly heavy buyers yesterday, traders said, and many were looking for medical technology stocks with a story. 
Popular were issues such as Phoenix Medical Technology, up 1 to 10 1/2. 
The small company is in a turnaround, having reported earnings in recent quarters after a sequence of losses. 
Its share price is up from 2 3/4 a year ago. 
Phoenix makes surgical drapes and vinyl gloves for medical examinations.

HEARING ON BUILDING NEAR ST. JUDE SLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a public hearing at 7:30 p.m. tonight to consider 
allowing a larger medical office building next to St. Jude Hospital and 
Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed building at the southeast corner of Harbor Boulevard and Valencia 
Mesa Drive has been rejected twice in the last seven months as being too large. 
</P>
<P>
Original plans called for a 109,000-square-foot office building to replace the 
31,500-square-foot building there now. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have complained that a larger office would increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, McBride Development Co. of Brea, reduced the size of the 
proposed building to 72,000 square feet and resubmitted the drawings to the 
Planning Commission in February. The commission denied those plans, 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the three-story medical building include a four-level parking garage 
with 355 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the expanded building, it is expected to adopt a 
recommendation by city planners to require off-site parking during construction 
because of the lost parking spaces. Planners also have asked the council to 
require a shuttle bus to operate between the building and parking lots at the 
hospital and a nearby closed restaurant.

<P>
Thomas J. McDermott, a co-founder of Four Star Television Inc., which once had 
11 shows in prime time each week, has died of a heart attack at his Santa 
Monica home. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Mahoney, a longtime friend, said the onetime advertising executive whose 
agency, Benton &amp; Bowles Inc., bought more than $5 billion worth of 
television time, was 65 when he died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Creator and/or producer of shows ranging from "Father Knows Best" to the 
daytime serials "The Edge of Night" and "As the World Turns," McDermott once 
was responsible for all network programming for Procter &amp; Gamble and 
General Foods Corp., two of the largest sponsors in broadcasting history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, he left advertising and with Dick Powell, Charles Boyer and David 
Niven formed Four Star Television, an outgrowth of the old Four Star Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
(Ida Lupino had been the fourth member of the Playhouse entertainment team, but 
when the company turned to production the title was retained, although there 
were only three "stars" remaining.) 
</P>
<P>
McDermott, who became president after Powell's death in 1963, helped create or 
produce "Wanted: Dead or Alive," "Zane Grey Theatre," "The Rifleman," "The 
Rogues," "Dante" and "The Big Valley." 
</P>
<P>
After Four Star was sold in 1970 he joined RCA. He left six years later to form 
a production partnership with Jack Wrather for movies and TV films. After 
Wrather's death in 1985 he bought out the Wrather library, which included the 
"Lassie" and "Lone Ranger" series and formed Southbrook Entertainment Corp. It 
was sold in 1987 for $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Anne, a daughter and two sons, who ask donations in 
his name to St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Their roots are in the desert lands of the
troubled Middle East. Like immigrants from Europe and elsewhere
they came to these shores looking for greater opportunity. Today
there are some 2.5 million Arab Americans in this country,
including key figures in government, education, entertainment,
sports and the arts.

   DETROIT (AP)- With anxious eyes on the Middle East, Americans
are suddenly aware that there are Arabs in their midst just as
American as they are, rich, bold, colorful tiles in the American
mosaic.
   For years they were an invisible minority, self-clothed in
ethnic and national anonymity.
   No one seemed to know or care whither they came. When the Tokyo
Olympics were televised in 1972 and the athletes of the world
paraded under their national banners, one TV commentator looked
down on one sparse Middle East contingent and concluded it was
``one of those new countries in Africa.''
   Today, Arab Americans constitue 1 percent of the U.S.
population, some 2.5 million in all. Most are clearly surprised,
even proud, to discover so many of their kind have risen to
prominence in their adopted land.
   If they were given an ethnic quiz, few would know:
   -That Christa McAuliffe, the inspirational schoolteacher who
died aboard the shuttle Challenger was one of their own.
   -That George Mitchell, Democratic Majority leader in the Senate,
and John Sununu, chief of staff in the Bush White House and former
governor of New Hampshire, have Lebanese blood.
   -Arab Americans include UCLA basketball coach Jim Harrick,
pioneer heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, Heisman Trophy winner and
pro quarterback Doug Flutie, Oscar winner (for ``Amadeus'') F. (for
Fahrid) Murray Abraham, actor Jamie Farr of ``MASH'' fame, dean of
the White House press corps Helen Thomas, founder of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving Candy Lightner, consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, author and movie producer William Peter Blatty (``The
Exorcist''), Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, Miami Heat
basketball star Ron Seikaly, radio disc jockey Casey Kasem, chess
champion Yasser Seirawan, singer-songwriter Paul Anka.
   They demolish the stereotypical image of the Arab as a shadowy
arms dealer, or a swarthy bedouin charlatan waving a scimitar as he
charges across the desert on an Arabian steed, or the irresistible
lover a la Rudolph Valentino in the old silent movies.
   Or the obedient, shrouded Arab women, suppressed by male
masters, keening over the dead in eerie wails.
   The greatest contradictions to these stereotypes are the Arab
Americans themselves. Can anyone imagine Marlo Thomas, one of the
nation's most ardent feminists, in purdah, or walking three paces
to the rear of husband Phil Donohue? And how can anyone compare her
father, actor-philanthropist Danny Thomas, raising money for St.
Jude's Children's Hospital, with some cinematic scimitar-weilding
terrorist?
   ``We have the most assimilated ethnic group in the country,''
says William Baroody, Jr., former chief of the Reagan White House
Office of Communication. ``A lot of them just weren't known as
quote-unquote Arab Americans.''
   ``We've always been a kind of private people,'' says Baroody,
whose grandparents came to the United States around the turn of the
century. ``I think you are seeing a much greater awareness on the
part of young people now, a greater involvement. ... I think that
they are a little more proud.''
   If previous generations tended to lose their identity in the
melting pot, present generations tend to be culturally distinct
parts of the mosaic.
   ``I think that's true of all ethnic groups,'' Baroody says,
``but it is definitely true of Arab Americans.''
   There is a growing pride in their Arabic background, in their
culture, their history. Every Arab American knows that the Arab
world, larger than the Roman Empire at its peak, preserved the arts
and sciences as Europe fell into intellectual darkness and waited
for the Renaissance. The Arab American knows that his fellow
Americans use the Arabic alphabet and numbers.
   The influx of Arabs to the United States began about 1880,
recruited as cheap labor for America. Most very simply sought the
gold that paved the streets.
   ``The real gold they found was opportunity,'' says Alixa Naff,
who has specialized in Arab American history and works at the
Smithsonian Institution. She says it is a fiction that they were in
flight from the Turks who controlled much of the Arab world until
World War I, although some young men did flee compulsory
conscription into the Turkish Army beginning in 1908.
   They were natural entrepreneurs. Many of them did what they knew
best, growing and mareting produce, fruits and vegetables.
   But they were also merchants and most began peddling notions and
Bibles out of a suitcase from the mountains of West Virginia to the
plains of the Midwest. They built the ``Mother Mosque'' in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, in 1934 and Syrian Orthodox Churches throughout
California.
   Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, came
from Cleveland where there was a large Lebanese Maronite Catholic
community. Her father owned grocery stores and eventually went into
real estate.
   ``My father was a very unusual man,'' he says. ``He believed in
women's education. My mother was a college graduate; my father was
not. He encouraged her to go to law school.''
   Almost every Middle Easterner of the second and third
generations speaks of supportive families and a commitment to
education.
   ``I fulfilled the dreams of my grandparents,'' says Shalala, who
was a professor at Columbia University, president of Hunter
College, a governor of the American Stock Exchange and a director
of the Municipal Assistance Corp. which helped New York City out of
its fiscal crisis. She is also vice chairman of the Children's
Defense Fund.
   The latest immigrants are fleeing for their lives, mostly
agrarian Moslem families from southern Lebanon, but there are also
Iraqi Chaldeans and some Palestinians, some of them professionals,
many of them seeking greater opportunities. The Yemenis are fleeing
poverty to seek jobs in idled auto plants or to work the fields of
California.
   Ismael Ahmed runs the Arab Community Center for Economics and
Social Services (ACCESS) in a depressed neighborhood of southern
suburban Dearborn, practically under the smokestacks of the Ford
River Rouge plant. The area he serves is considered the largest
concentrated Arab community outside the Middle East.
   ``Just within five miles of our center there are 60,000 Arabic
speaking people,'' Ahmed says. ``Six out of 10 of them have been
here less than five years, one out of three doesn't speak English,
two out of three don't read or write English, and one out of three
doesn't read or write Arabic.

<HL> Thatcher: Sow, and Ye Shall Reap for All </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> EUROP </CO>
<TEXT>
      In a speech this month to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher outlined the spiritual beliefs that underpin her political philosophy. Mrs. Thatcher, who said she was "speaking personally as a Christian as well as a politician," stressed self-reliance and personal responsibility. Excerpts follow:
   We are told we must work and use our talents to create wealth. 
"If a man will not work he shall not eat," wrote St. Paul to the Thessalonians. 
Indeed, abundance rather than poverty has a legitimacy which derives from the very nature of Creation. 

   Nevertheless, the Tenth Commandment -- Thou shalt not covet -- recognizes that making money and owning things could become selfish activities. 
But it is not the creation of wealth that is wrong but love of money for its own sake. 

   The spiritual dimension comes in deciding what one does with the wealth. 
How could we respond to the many calls for help, or invest for the future, or support the wonderful artists and craftsmen whose work also glorifies God, unless we had first worked hard and used our talents to create the necessary wealth? . . . 


   I confess that I always had difficulty with interpreting the biblical precept to love our neighbors "as ourselves" until I read some of the words of C.S. Lewis. 
He pointed out that we don't exactly love ourselves when we fall below the standards and beliefs we have accepted. 
Indeed, we might even hate ourselves for some unworthy deed. 

   None of this, of course, tells us exactly what kind of political and social institutions we should have. 

   On this point, Christians will very often genuinely disagree, though it is a mark of Christian manners that they will do so with courtesy and mutual respect. 
What is certain, however, is that any set of social and economic arrangements which is not founded on the acceptance of individual responsibility will do nothing but harm. 
We are all responsible for our own actions. 
We cannot blame society if we disobey the law. 
We simply cannot delegate the exercise of mercy and generosity to others. 

   The politicians and other secular powers should strive by their measures to bring out the good in people and to fight down the bad; but they can't create the one or abolish the other. 
They can only see that the laws encourage the best instincts and convictions of the people -- instincts and convictions which I am convinced are far more deeply rooted than is often supposed. 

   Nowhere is this more evident than the basic ties of the family, which are at the heart of our society and are the very nursery of civic virtue. 
It is on the family that we in government build our own policies for welfare, education and care. 
You recall that Timothy was warned by St. Paul that anyone who neglects to provide for his own house (meaning his own family) has disowned the faith and is "worse than an infidel." 

   We must recognize that modern society is infinitely more complex than that of biblical times and of course new occassions teach new duties. 
In our generation, the only way we can ensure that no one is left without sustenance, help or opportunity, is to have laws to provide for health and education, pensions for the elderly, succor for the sick and disabled. 

   But intervention by the state must never become so great that it effectively removes personal responsibility. 
The same applies to taxation, for while you and I would work extremely hard whatever the circumstances, there are undoubtedly some who would not unless the incentive was there. 
And we need their efforts, too. 

   Recently there have been great debates about religious education. 
I believe politicians must see that religious education has a proper place in the school curriculum. 
The Christian religion -- which, of course, embodies many of the great spiritual and moral truths of Judaism -- is a fundamental part of our national heritage. 
For centuries it has been our very lifeblood. 
Indeed, we are a nation whose ideals are founded on the Bible. 
Also, it is quite impossible to understand our history or literature without grasping this fact. 

   That is the strong practical case for ensuring that children at school are given adequate instruction in the part which the Judaic-Christian tradition has played in molding our laws, manners and institutions. 
How can you make sense of Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, or of the constitutional conflicts of the 17th century in both Scotland and England, without some such knowledge? 

   But I go further than this. 
The truths of the Judaic-Christian tradition are infinitely precious, not only, as I believe, because they are true, but also because they provide the moral impulse which alone can lead to that peace, in the true meaning of the word, for which we all long. 

   To assert absolute moral values is not to claim perfection for ourselves. 
No true Christian could do that. 
What is more, one of the great principles of our Judaic-Christian inheritance is tolerance. 

   People with other faiths and cultures have always been welcomed in our land, assured of equality under the law, of proper respect and of open friends. 
There is absolutely nothing incompatible between this and our desire to maintain the essence of our own identity. 
There is no place for racial or religious intolerance in our creed. 

   When Abraham Lincoln spoke in his famous Gettysburg speech of 1863 of "government of the people," he gave the world a neat definition of democracy which has since been widely and enthusiastically adopted. 
But what he enunciated as a form of government was not in itself especially Christian, for nowhere in the Bible is the word democracy mentioned. 
Ideally, when Christians meet, as Christians, to take counsel together their purpose is not (or should not be) to ascertain what is the mind of the majority but what is the mind of the Holy Spirit -- something which may be quite different. 

   Nevertheless I am an enthusiast for democracy. 
And I take that position not because I believe majority opinion is inevitably right or true -- indeed, no majority can take away God-given human rights. 
But because I believe it most effectively safeguards the value of the individual, and, more than any other system, restrains the abuse of power by the few. 
And that is a Christian concept. 

   But there is little hope for democracy if the hearts of men and women in democratic societies cannot be touched by a call to something greater than themselves. 
Political structures, state institutions, collective ideals are not enough. 
We parliamentarians can legislate for the rule of law. 
You the church can teach the life of faith. 

   When all is said and done, a politician's role is a humble one. 
I always think that the whole debate about the church and the state has never yielded anything comparable in insight to that beautiful hymn "I vow to thee my country." 
It begins with a triumphant assertion of what might be described as secular patriotism, a noble thing indeed in a country like ours: "I vow to thee my country all earthly things above; entire, whole and perfect the service of my love." 
It goes on to speak of "another country I heard of long ago" whose King cannot be seen and whose armies cannot be counted, but "soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase." 

   Not group by group or party by party or even church by church -- but soul by soul -- and each one counts.

   MEMPHIS (AP ) _ President Bush on Wednesday urged the news media
and other organizations to join his crusade for volunteerism by
publicizing good works until they become part of ``everyday
thinking.''
   ``Imagine if every institution, from airlines to dry cleaners to
high schools to neighborhood softball teams, were to join regularly
honoring as heroes those who are engaged in the war against drug
abuse, illiteracy, AIDS, homelessness, hunger and other problems,''
Bush said in a speech at the Commercial Appeal newspaper.
   ``We are nearing the dawn of a new decade. Let it be a decade
with no dark corners, no forgotten people, no forgotten places.''
   Bush made the comments at a soggy outdoor ceremony to honor the
Commercial Appeal's ongoing campaign focusing on people involved in
community service.
   The daily ``Points of Light'' feature in the newspaper stems
from Bush's inauguration call for ``1,000 points of light.'' It is
one of his favorite themes, and he uses the phrase to refer to
individuals, businesses and groups whose volunteerism makes society
better for everyone.
   Bush also paid a visit to St. Jude's Children's Research
Hospital, where he was greeted by the facility's founder,
entertainer Danny Thomas.
   Bush looked in on a handful of children cancer victims and said
he regretted he had never before visited the renowned center, which
specializes in fatal childhood diseases.
   In his remarks at the Commercial Appeal, Bush said other media
organization's should follow the newspaper's example in encouraging
community service.
   ``I'd like to challenge every publisher, every broadcaster,
every member of the American news media, to follow the lead of the
Commercial Appeal,'' he said.
   ``Imagine an America where service to others is a fact of life,
part of everyone's everyday thinking.''
   Bush told a crowd that gathered in a pouring rain outside the
newspaper that ``every one of us has a special talent that can help
solve America's problems. ... So if you've got a hammer, find a
nail. If you can read, find someone who can't . If you're not in
trouble, seek out someone who is. Because everywhere there is a
need in America, there is a way to fill it.''
   Bush also announced the White House would begin a ``points of
light'' program to each day single out a person or institution that
exemplifies the concept of community service.
   ``Each day the White House will recognize one individual or
institution who has successfully addressed our most dire social
problems by engaging in community service,'' the White House said
in a statement.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Siemens sells pacemaker unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the Munich-based electronics and electricals group, is selling its
US-based cardiac pacemaker manufacturing business for 'slightly over'
Dollars 500m. The buyer is St Jude Medical, a manufacturer of artificial
heart valves and blood pumps based in St Paul, Minnesota.
The pacemaker business generated Dollars 350m in turnover for Siemens last
year. Siemens said the sale was driven by strategic considerations, in view
of changes in the market for products implanted during heart surgery,
including artificial blood vessels, valves, heart muscle pumps and
artificial hearts.
Physicians and hospitals had previously bought individual products from
different companies, but there was now a trend towards 'single-sourcing',
Siemens said.
This trend was encouraging the development of companies providing the full
spectrum of products.
Siemens supplies a range of products to cardiologists, but its activities in
the field of cardiac systems for implantation are limited to pacemakers.
It said yesterday it had decided to sell the business - the second biggest
manufacturer of pacemakers in the world - rather than seek to expand across
the full range of implantation products.
Siemens is the world's largest manufacturer of medical systems, with total
sales of DM7.9bn (Dollars 5.03bn) in this area last year. It said the
pacemaker business was profitable, and that sales had risen consistently in
recent years.
A total of 1,300 employees will move to St Jude as a result of the sale.
The sale will take effect in the fourth quarter of Siemens' current
financial year, which ends on September 30.

<TEXT>     MERCK;   New York Exchange;   52-week range: 72 3/8-129 3/4;   Friday's
close: 127 1/8;   "It is no secret that Merck is an excellent issue. Indeed,
it is often seen as the best-managed firm in the country, with a research and
development program that is unmatched in its industry. Merck has 18 drugs with
sales over $100 million. The issue, despite a fairly lofty price tag, is a
premier holding in the drug group. We expect earnings to rise 18 percent this
year to $5.40 a share and to at least $6.35 in 1992.";   -- Dow Theory
Forecasts, Hammond, Ind.; (hbox);   BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB;   New York Exchange;
  52-week range: 55 3/8-87 7/8;   Friday's close: 86 1/4;   "Consistent growth
in sales, earnings, and dividends is a hallmark at Bristol-Myers Squibb. The
company is a powerhouse in cardiovascular, anti-infective, anti-cancer, and
anti-anxiety drugs, to name a few. Current growth is being driven by strong
sales of established products such as Capoten (for hypertension), Buspar
(tranquilizer), the anti-cancer lineup, and antibiotics. Financially, the
company is rock solid with little debt and lots of cash. In addition,
management continues to buy back stock. The shares are not undiscovered; they
sell at 21 times estimated 1991 earnings. But the stock continues to offer
excellent long-term potential. Buy.";   -- United &amp; Babson Investment Report,
Wellesley Hills, Mass.;   (hbox);   PFIZER;   New York Exchange;   52-week
range: 32 1/8-66 7/8;   Friday's close: 68 1/4;   "Heavy spending on research
at Pfizer -- equal to 10 percent of sales -- has resulted in one of the
industry's best product pipelines. Sales of four drugs -- Procardia XL (a
heart drug), Cardura and Norvasc (cardiovascular agents), and Diflucan (an
anti-viral compound) -- are strong. Since 1981, earnings have increased every
year except 1989. The current fiscal year should see profits from $2.38 to
$2.75 per share. Next year should see even stronger growth, with net in the
$3.30 area likely. Technically, Pfizer began a new upleg when it pushed
decisively through 60. Boasting solid 2-to-1 upside volume, we recommend
purchase at or below 64. Our price target is 75 to 80.";   -- The Addison
Report, Franklin, Mass.;   (hbox);   ST. JUDE MEDICAL;   Over the counter;  
52-week range: 24 1/2-52 3/4;   Friday's close: 50 1/2;   "St. Jude Medical is
the world's largest manufacturer of mechanical heart valves, accounting for
over half of all valves implanted to date. The firm has a magnificent track
record for growth, and has an excellent history of stock splits. The
introduction of new opportunities in Western Europe, a new centrifugal
blood-pump system, and the establishment of a new independent sales force
should boost growth in 1991 and 1992. Even though St. Jude Medical is
considerably more volatile than most stocks, we believe it is an excellent
addition to just about anyone's portfolio. We recommend accumulation of these
shares.";   -- The Marketarian Letter, Grand Island, Neb.;   (hbox);  
RESPIRONICS;   Over the counter;   52-week range: 12 1/2-29;   Friday's close:
23 3/4;   "We can't resist Respironics. The company designs and markets
medical products that address a wide range of pulmonary problems by assisting
patient breathing. Respironics' unique products have given the company a
strong niche that should keep it in solid standing. In 1990, earnings reached
62 cents a share, up from 39 cents in fiscal 1989. The company apparently
didn't even notice the recession of the past year. Sales for fiscal 1991 rose
56.5 percent, while earnings rose an incredible 66 percent. We are confident
that this company will prove to be a profitable addition to our buy list.";  
-- Investment Horizons, Chicago.;   (hbox);   U.S. SURGICAL;   New York
Exchange;   52-week range: 20 3/4-75 7/8;   Friday's close: 68 1/2;   "U.S.
Surgical is engaged in developing and marketing a proprietary line of surgical
wound products. This business is booming. The company is now entering two
enormous new markets -- laparoscopy and surgical sutures. We believe the
company will sustain earnings growth of 30 percent plus annually through the
first half of this decade. Selling at around 50 times our 1991 earnings
estimate of $1.50 a share, the stock is not cheap. However, we find the stock
attractive, given its strong current business and outstanding new-product
opportunities.";   -- David Lothson, Paine Webber.;   (hbox);   AMERICAN HOME
PRODUCTS;   New York Exchange;   52-week range: 43-65;   Friday's close: 63
3/8;   "American Home Products is generally perceived to be a purveyor of
mature food and home health products; as a result, it typically trades at a
hefty discount to other leading drug stocks. We don't believe this discount is
warranted. In fact, we believe the stock is worth a premium. American Home is
a leading maker of pharmaceutical and health-care products, with brand names
such as Advil, Anacin, Dimetapp, Inderal, Premarin, Norplant, Dristan, and
Robitussin. Through restructurings, return on equity is now near 40 percent --
triple the U.S. average. Profit margins are exceptionally high and rising.
Cash flow is enormous. This issue offers investors a combination of growth
potential, good stability, a top quality balance sheet, and generous dividend
payout. Buy.";   -- Alston Barrow, Favorably Positioned Stocks, Tampa, Fla.  </TEXT>
