  [Text] London, March 16--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today reaffirmed India's solemn commitment to 
fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the constitution and 
asserted that "there is no question of any going back on human 
rights of the individual citizens," reports PTI. 
  Speaking after paying his homage to the historic magna 
carta, 
a source of inspiration and a symbol of freedom under the law 
throughout the world, Mr Rao said the Indian constitution 
provides the individual freedoms in no uncertain terms and 
chapter three of the constitution on fundamental rights was full 
elaboration of the principles symbolised by the magna carta 
memorial. The memorial was erected at the spot at which King 
John and his barons put their seal to charter of magna carta 779 
years ago on June 15, 1215. 
  The Prime Minister unveiled a commemorative plaque and 
planted an English oak at the memorial on the bank of river 
Thames at Runnymede in Surrey about 25 km from here to mark 
significance of this symbol of freedom on India's development of 
democratic government. 
  Mr Rao briefly addressed the distinguished audience which 
had 
gathered at the memorial in the meadows of Surrey braving heavy 
showers and a mild hailstorm before the Prime Minister's 
arrival. The memorial was erected in 1957 by the American Bar 
Association whose central pillar bears the inscription "to 
commemorate magna carta, symbol of freedom under law." 
  The Indian Prime Minister is the second statesman after 
President, J.F. Kennedy to associate himself with the home of 
magna carta. 
  Mr Rao spoke about the human rights situation in India and 
said those in the administration knew how difficult it was for 
the government to conform to the stringent law of freedom in 
the Indian judicial system. "But we are doing and there is no 
question of going back on the fundamental freedom of the human 
rights of individual citizens." 
  Mr Rao ruled out India accepting any "regional" arrangement 
for nuclear non-proliferation and called for a global and 
non-discriminatory regime against proliferation. 
  "Proliferation could not be stopped nor clandestine activity 
prevented without a global and non-discriminatory regime," Mr 
Rao told Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, during their 
30-minute meeting here on the third day of the Prime Minister's 
four-day official visit to the U.K. yesterday. 
  Aboard his aircraft, the Prime Minister said Britain's stand 
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir "is not very far from 
ours." 
  On the British view on Kashmir, Mr Rao said that its 
position 
was not identical to India's "but on the whole it is not very 
far from our stand."

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Sunday called for a new Magna Carta that would establish basic
rights for all Europeans, including the Soviets.
   Mrs. Thatcher also renewed her call for the United Nations to
apply a total economic embargo against Iraq unless it withdraws
without delay from its occupation of Kuwait. She said the embargo
only would be fully effective if it were supported by all members
of the United Nations.
   ``Iraq's invastion of Kuwait defies every principle for which
the UN stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel
safe again. The law of the jungle takes over,'' she said.
   The prime minister devoted most of her remarks to more than
3,000 people at the Aspen Institute to her vision of the new Europe.
   ``The European Community has reconciled antagonisms within
Western Europe; it should now help to overcome divisions between
East and West in Europe,'' she sand at the closing session of the
Institute's 40th anniversary.
   ``We don't see this new Soviet Union as an enemy, but as a
country groping its way towards freedom. We no longer have to view
the world through the prism of East-West relations. The Cold War is
over.''
   At the end of her half-hour speech inside the big blue-and-white
Aspen Music Festival tent, the crowd gave Thatcher a standing
ovation.
   About 1,700 people were seated inside the big top. The rest were
scattered about the lawn outside in the warm, summer air.
   Thatcher traveled to the institute to address its annual
symposium and receive its Statesman Award, which recognized the
prime minister's long reign and her commitment to democracy and
peace.
   Thatcher met with President Bush in Aspen on Thursday before his
opening address at the institute. She is scheduled to travel to
Washington, D.C., Monday for an afternoon meeting with Bush, then
return to London early Tuesday.
   During her speech, Thatcher said Western nations need to help
nations struggling to establish democracy, but at the same time
maintain a secure defense, including NATO and U.S. forces in Europe.
   ``The unity and strength which we in the West have found from
joining together in defense can now be turned to serve more
positive and ambitious purposes,'' she said.
   King John of England was forced by English barons to grant the
original Magna Carta at Runnymede, England, June 15, 1215. It
traditionally has been interpreted as guaranteeing certain civil
and political liberties.
   The prime minister said her proposed European Magna Carta would
``entrench for every European citizen, including those of the
Soviet Union, the basic rights we in the West take for granted.''
   Among those rights: freedom of speech, worship, access to law
and the marketplace, and the freedom to hold democratic elections,
own property, maintain nationhood and remain free of ``fear of an
over-mighty state.''
   She also suggested that the European Community be poised to
accept all Eastern European nations as members ``when democracy has
taken root and their economies are capable of sustaining
membership.''
   ``We can't say in one breath that they are part of Europe, and
in the next our European Community Club is so exclusive that we
won't admit them,'' she said.
   Founded in 1950, the non-profit Aspen Institute gathers leaders
in all parts of society to discuss critical issues of the world.
The symposium this weekend concentrated on topics including health
care and education.

<LEADPARA>  Every day the bishop of Lincoln prays for a solution to what has been called
Lincoln Cathedral's most damaging dispute since King John's soldiers attacked
it in 1217.;    But neither prayer nor a professional counselor brought in to
calm the row over allegations of financial ineptitude have answered Bishop
Robert Hardy's entreaties.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We haven't resolved the issue," said the cathedral dean, Brandon Jackson.;
   The dean is fighting with his canons: Subdean Rex Davis, responsible for
cathedral finances; cathedral Chancellor John Nurser; Precentor David Rutter;
and Archdeacon Christopher Laurence.;    At issue: a disastrous attempt to
raise money by sending the cathedral's copy of the Magna Carta to Australia.
The dispute has been poisonous, and the police have been called in.;    At one
point, Jackson wrote to Davis: "I have found it virtually impossible to work
with you.";    Davis, in a statement leaked to the press, spoke of "innuendo,
dirty tricks, press leaks, threatening remarks and other unseemly and
demeaning behavior.";    Norman Leeds, assistant chief constable of
Lincolnshire police, said in November that police were looking into
allegations, but he did not spell them out.;    With Jackson, the canons are
responsible for running England's third-largest cathedral.;    A medieval
masterpiece, the hilltop cathedral dominates the city of Lincoln in eastern
England, 130 miles north of London.;    High in the cathedral's Angel Choir
squats the Lincoln Imp, symbol of the city. Set there by medieval masons, the
grinning little stone figure is said to have been sent by the devil to cause
trouble on Earth.;    The trouble at Lincoln started when Nurser, Rutter,
Laurence and the then-dean, Oliver Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, agreed to
Davis' proposal to exhibit the cathedral's Magna Carta, Latin for "Great
Charter," at the World Expo that opened April 1988 in Brisbane, Australia.;   
The document was signed by King John in 1215 under threat from his barons. A
foundation stone of English liberties, it granted church rights and individual
freedoms. Only four original manuscripts exist.;    The project aimed to raise
money for cathedral conservation but instead left it $108,600 worse off.;   
The Magna Carta pavilion attracted 900,000 people, but the venture lost money.
Last month, The Independent newspaper reported that the cathedral spent nearly
$2 million on arrangements in Brisbane, leaving a deficit of about $1.3
million. Expo officials waived most of the debts.;    Bishop Hardy wrote in a
report that accountants could trace no written record of cash counted in
Australia. He accused the Lincoln Chapter of financial ineptitude and said the
canons should consider resigning.;    Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes retired in
1989 and Jackson, then provost at Bradford Cathedral, was appointed to replace
him.;    Jackson, 56, began investigating the Australia trip and passed
details to the Church of England newspaper, the Church Times, which broke the
story in January 1990 under the headline, "How the Lincoln Chapter Burned Its
Fingers.";    Relations between Jackson and the canons deteriorated to the
point where they called in the bishop. The dean asked him to examine the
Australia visit. The canons asked him to investigate their relationship with
Jackson.;    Hardy's report last September said the attitude of the canons was
reprehensible and that they and the dean had conducted themselves shamefully
in the news media.;    "It all seems a very long way from Jesus of Nazareth,"
Hardy wrote.  </TEXT>

   Rule of Law:
   Soviet Coup Blocked the Planned All-Union Runnymede

   The totalitarian government had long overstayed its
welcome. Reformers insisted that the ruler no longer use
arbitrary power. They wanted wider distribution of power and
a presumption in favor of political and economic freedom for
the people. Functionaries of the central power tried
intimidation, but the top official eventually lost the
support of almost every group in society. He was forced to
give up what had been nearly absolute power.
   The place was Runnymede in England, the year was 1215 and
it was King John who was forced to submit to the Magna Carta
and its revolutionary idea of legalized political and
economic liberty. The king's promises included more power to
regional lords, trials by juries of peers, due process and a
ban on expropriation of private property. This defining
moment for what we now know as "the West" never found an echo
in the Duchy of Muscovy, czarist Russia or communist U.S.S.R.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The closest the Soviets ever came to the Magna Carta was
scheduled for last week, when the All-Union Treaty was
supposed to be signed. The treaty was canceled during the
coup that couldn't. The timing of the failed "Putsch" has
been linked to provisions in the treaty that would have given
more power to the republics. It hasn't been widely noted that
the treaty and implementing laws also threatened the power of
the Communist Party by introducing counterrevolutionary legal
reform.
   The treaty would have been the first Soviet charter of
rights for the people, not for the state. The treaty, which
does not mention the word socialism, would have created a new
Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics. The republics and
central government would pledge to "create a rule-of-law
state which would serve as a guarantor against any tendencies
to totalitarianism and arbitrariness."
   Which raises the question, why a Soviet Union? Since its
founding, the U.S.S.R. has been defined as a state above the
law. Lenin, a lawyer before he switched careers, proclaimed
that "A law is a political measure, it is politics." Marxism,
he said, requires the withering away of such bourgeois
concepts as equal justice under impartial law. Local party
bosses have administered "telephone justice" to dictate the
correct verdict and sentence, prosecutors administered
psychiatric prisons and judges owed their tenure to party
bosses.
   Appropriately enough for a country founded on
expropriation, the All-Union Treaty also included a section
on property rights. "The Union and states forming it ensure
free development and protection of all forms of property,"
the treaty said, "and create conditions for the functioning
of enterprises and economic organizations." This is not as
precisely worded as the prohibition against expropriation in
either the Magna Carta or the U.S. Constitution. Still, it
would have been enough, for example, to block the Soviet
decree earlier this year that seized 50- and 100-ruble notes.
   The treaty also would have created a new Constitutional
Court whose judges would be appointed with the approval of
popularly elected representatives from the republics. At
least some of the Soviet judiciary would have been
independent of the party for the first time.
   Recent laws would also clip the powers of prosecutors,
known as procurators, who are also traditionally appointed
for their fealty to the party. Jury trials would become more
common and defense lawyers would get access to their clients
from the beginning of a case. "We must have one dictatorship
for all -- the dictatorship of law and not a dictatorship of
any political group or body of power, Mikhail Gorbachev told
a meeting of Soviet procurators earlier this year. "A
procurator or judge must be guided by law and law alone."
This was a direct challenge to party apparatchiks.
   Indeed, these legal reforms may have posed an even greater
threat to totalitarian rule than the treaty plan to spread
power to the republics. It's one thing to lessen the grip of
Moscow, it's another also to strip local party officials of
their arbitrary power to block licenses, jail "black
marketeers" or seize property.
   By blocking the All-Union Treaty, the hard-line communists
gambled that they could block the double whammy of a rule of
law that protects private property. Instead, many republics
now refuse to join any union, confederation or commonwealth
for fear that some other group of communists will again try
to block reforms. It's no wonder many leaders of the
republics and democratic parliamentarians this week asked why
there should be a Soviet Anything.
   Now reformers face one of the greatest challenges to the
idea of a rule of law. They say they will punish even the
coup plotters with law. "We must all pull away from euphoria,
including from the euphoria of victory," Russian President
Boris Yeltsin said on Monday. "And only the law must operate
-- no euphoria related to vindictiveness, otherwise we would
lose our self-respect as democrats."
   Legal punishment for the coup would be extraordinary in a
country that wrote the script for show trials. There are laws
against treason, though just who represented the "state" is a
nice question. It's also not yet clear whether the suicides
of plotters and sympathizers will turn out to be a variant of
"coup flu"; the translation from the Russian could make
suicide a transitive verb -- as in Interior Minister Boris
Pugo was suicided by parties unknown. And of course many of
Mr. Yeltsin's post-coup decrees against the party had no
apparent legal authority, including his decision to fire the
coup-backing director of Tass and head of the Novosti news
agency.
   Still, there is high irony in pleas for legal protection
by party functionaries. One of the final acts of a group
called the Ruling Council of the Communist Party Control
Commission was to invoke the rights the party denied everyone
else for the past 74 years. "We appeal to leaders of state
organs not to fall for emotions" against the party for the
coup attempt, citing "violations of human rights and people's
prosecutions for political convictions."
   Russia and the other republics will find that there are
those in even the most advanced countries who, given the
chance, will abuse the law for political ends. American
manufacturers faced with deep-pocket-picking
product-liability laws could give tutorials on the dangers of
politicized law. So could executive-branch targets of
Congress's "independent counsel" and RICOed defendants.
   Still, the coup plotters were entirely right to understand
that introducing modern legal concepts to the Soviet Union
would be fatal to communism. Assuming that the Communist
Party's over, it will be fascinating to watch the newest
adherents to the rule of law join the Western world.

   Today is Thursday, June 15, the 166th day of 1989. There are 199
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On June 15, 1215, King John signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede,
England, granting his barons more liberty.
   On this date:
   In 1520, Pope Leo X threatened to excommunicate Martin Luther if
he did not recant his religious beliefs.
   In 1775, the Second Continental Congress voted unanimously to
appoint George Washington head of the Continental Army.
   In 1836, Arkansas became the 25th state.
   In 1844, Charles Goodyear received a patent for his process to
strengthen rubber. Even so, Goodyear did not benefit from the
invention, and died in poverty in 1860.
   In 1846, the United States and Britain signed a treaty settling
the boundary between Canada and the U.S. in the Pacific Northwest.
   In 1849, James Polk, the eleventh president of the United
States, died in Nashville.
   In 1864, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton signed an order
designating a site in Arlington, Va., as a military cemetery.
   In 1904, more than a thousand people died when fire erupted
aboard the steamboat General Slocum in the East River of New York
City.
   In 1944, American forces began their successful invasion of
Saipan in the Central Pacific in World War II.
   In 1967, Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a bill liberalizing
California's abortion law.
   In 1977, in Spain's first free elections in 41 years, a
center-right coalition won a parliamentary majority.
   In 1978, King Hussein of Jordan married 26-year-old American
Elizabeth Halaby, and proclaimed his bride Queen Noor al-Hussein,
Arabic for ``Light of Hussein.''
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter and Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev met for the first time, in Vienna.
   Five years ago: Walter Mondale, the nominee-apparent of the
Democratic Party, said he would interview San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas during the
following week as potential running mates.
   One year ago: The British colony of Hong Kong announced a
clampdown on ``boat people,'' saying newly arriving Vietnamese
refugees would be incarcerated and returned to Vietnam if they
could not prove they fled religious or political persecution.
   Today's birthdays: Democratic Congressman Morris K. Udall of
Arizona is 67. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is 57. Singer Waylon
Jennings is 52. Singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson is 48.
Comedian-actor Jim Belushi is 35.
   Thought for today: ``The present contains nothing more than the
past, and what is found in the effect was already in the cause.'' _
Henri Bergson, French author and philosopher (1859-1941).

   Sen. Edward Kennedy led a group of
people Tuesday to a stone memorial for his slain brother and laid a
single white rose at the marker in a meadow where the Magna Carta
was signed.
   Kennedy traveled without advance publicity to the memorial 20
miles west of London, paid his respects with a handful of friends,
and was gone before other visitors arrived on the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
   The youngest of the Kennedy brothers placed the rose at the foot
of the stark, oblong memorial stone, crossed himself and silently
mouthed a prayer.
   In Britain and elsewhere in Europe, the anniversary of Kennedy's
death was marked by special television programs and newspaper
articles examining his legacy and the various conspiracy theories
surrounding his murder.
   West Berlin remembered Kennedy with special fondness for his 1963
visit and ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech expressing solidarity with
the city. Peter Rebsch, president of the West Berlin parliament,
laid a wreath outside city hall.
   West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, in a speech Monday night
marking the anniversary, said: ``Kennedy's visit and his speech were
unforgettable. His acknowledgment of Berlin as a symbol of freedom
helped cement the self-confidence of Berliners.''
   Vatican Radio remembered the ``tragic event that shook the world
and that hit at the heart of the American dream.''
   During his visit to Runnymeade, Edward Kennedy was accompanied by
three English friends of the Kennedy family Dinah Bridge, Lady Anne
Tree and Chiquita Astor.
   The Massachusetts Democrat also was joined by Americans James
Wyeth, painter of a celebrated posthumous portrait of the president,
and historical author Larry Collins.
   The weather was clear but freezing cold. As the small party
walked across a field away from the memorial, a supersonic Concorde
jet took off from nearby Heathrow Airport, a brilliant white dart
etched against the blue sky.
   The monument sits in a meadow at Runnymede, where in 1215 King
John signed the Magna Carta, or great charter, which would become
the cornerstone of Western civil liberties. It lies on the side of a
hill, not on the top, to symbolize a life cut short before its time.
   The 5-foot-high stone slab, paid for by public donations and
unveiled in 1965, is inscribed with Kennedy's words from his
inaugural address: ``We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet
any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe in order to
assure the survival and success of liberty.''
   Kennedy told The Associated Press the memorial had ``a special
meaning to all the members of the family and I welcome the chance to
come out with some of the close friends ... dear friends of
President Kennedy.''
   He declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th anniversary
of his brother's death, saying: ``We think it's extremely important
to celebrate the life of President Kennedy rather than the tragedy.
We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and the hope of his life
rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   Doreen Ramsey, 64, and her 71-year-old husband Eric, drove more
than 100 miles from Bristol to visit the memorial.
   ``We felt as though the world had stopped,'' said Mrs. Ramsey,
remembering the assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
   One man laid a wreath, said he was there ``to honor a very great
American,'' and broke down in tears, turning away quickly.

Charter'') at Runnymede, England, granting his barons more liberty.
   On this date:
   In 1520, Pope Leo X threatened to ex-communicate Martin Luther if
he did not recant his religious beliefs.
   In 1775, the Second Continental Congress voted unanimously to
appoint George Washington head of the Continental Army.
   In 1836, Arkansas became the 25th state.
   In 1844, Charles Goodyear received a patent for his process to
strengthen rubber. (However, Goodyear failed to benefit from his

   In 1846, the United States and Britain signed a treaty settling
the boundary between Canada and the U.S. in the Pacific Northwest.

   Many British schoolteachers have trouble spelling,
can't do a simple sum and don't know West Germany's capital,
according to a survey published Sunday.
   The Sunday Times commissioned a general knowledge survey of 308
teachers in primary, junior high and high schools nationwide and
reported three-quarters of them could not spell ``embarrass,''
``satellite'' and ``harassment.''
   ``Almost all made mistakes over the 16 simple questions on
current affairs, geography, spelling, maths, science, history and
literature,'' said the weekly, which commissioned the telephone
survey from Market Opinion and Research International.
   ``The results of this survey would be laughable if they were not
so devastating,'' said Peter Dawson, general secretary of the
Professional Association of Teachers.
   The Sunday Times said a press officer at the Department of
Education also had difficulty spelling the three test words and
could not do the percentage question.
   The Sunday Times said the results of the survey might help
explain its poll two ago, which found that one in six British
adults could not find Britain on a map, half did not know how to
read a railway timetable and two-thirds could not spell
``embarrass.''
   One in five of the teachers surveyed did not know King John
signed the Magna Carta and 15 percent didn't know that ``The
Canterbury Tales'' was written by Geoffrey Chaucer, the father of
English poetry.
   Sixteen percent, including 22 of the 171 math and science
teachers queried, were unable to answer when asked: ``What is 15
percent of 10 pounds sterling?'' (answer: 1.50 pounds)
   Eleven percent of the teachers could not say how many
millimeters are in a meter (1,000) and one in 24 thought the Rev.
Ian Paisley, the militant and much publicized Northern Ireland
Protestant politician, was a Roman Catholic.
   One in five did not know Warsaw is the capital of Poland, 27
percent did not know that Bonn is the capital of West Germany, and
47 percent did not know that Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan.
Forty-two percent got all three capitals right.
   The reporter who wrote the story got everything right except the
one about the Magna Carta, traditionally regarded as the basis of
English liberties. He said he had no idea who signed it.

   Police today accused ``international socialists''
of being behind widespread tax protests that disrupted local
council meetings and led to clashes with authorities.
   But a protest organizer said 99 percent of the demonstrators
were local people angered at having to pay higher taxes.
   The controversial new ``community charge'' is a flat tax on all
adults over age 18 that opponents say unfairly favors the wealthy.
   People rebelling against it included an 89-year-old former war
correspondent who handed back his medal at Buckingham Palace and a
teacher who lectured magistrates on the Magna Carta.
   Four constables were injured and 21 demonstrators arrested
Tuesday in the worst violence, in Bristol. Anti-tax disturbances
also were reported in Bradford, Birmingham, Exeter, Maidenhead,
Norwich, Weston-super-Mare, Worcester, Gillingham, Lowestoft and
Reading.
   Police Federation chairman Alan Eastwood claimed that many
protesters were from outside London.
   ``It is rent-a-mob Trotskyites who attend most of these
demonstrations,'' he contended in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. Radio 4.
   ``Why should a police officer have to be assaulted because
somebody feels aggrieved about a tax? It is these international
socialists who take on any issue to have a go at the police,'' he
said.
   Steve Nally, secretary of the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax
Federation, said he sympathized with the far-left Militant group,
which along with ``many other people from a broad political
spectrum'' had been involved in peaceful protests against what has
been dubbed the poll tax.
   He insisted 99 percent of the protesters were local people.
   ``We don't condone the violence that has gone on, but we
understand people are very angry about this issue,'' he said on the
same program.
   The citizens were backed by their representatives in the House
of Commons, where Michael Martin of the opposition Labor Party told
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, ``Your friends are deserting you.
Why don't you give up this irrational obsession to implement the
poll tax?''
   Mrs. Thatcher, whose waning popularity has been blamed in part
on the tax, again blamed local councils for spending too much money
and thus forcing taxes to be increased.
   Scuffles began in Bristol as about 500 demonstators learned that
the council set a tax of $810 per adult per year, one of the
highest in England. One policeman was taken to the hospital
unconscious after he was knocked to the ground, kicked and punched.
   In the northern city of Birmingham, protesters scuffled with
council officials and police. A councilor of the governing
Conservative party and two teenage aides held doors to the council
chamber shut and kept all but half a dozen demonstrators out.
   David Green, 18, who is working for the Conservatives before
starting university studies, was punched in the face and bruised.
``They just started to push their way in and I was determined to
stop them,'' he said.
   The council meeting was suspended for 30 minutes. There were no
arrests.
   Two officers were injured as police fought running battles with
tax protesters in Weston-Super-Mare in Avon. The council meeting
there was suspended for more than two hours as doors and windows
were smashed and scores of people invaded the building.
   One group of protesters staged a sit-in annd nine people were
arrested before order was restored, police said.
   Council meetings in Norwich and Maidenhead were halted by
invasions of demonstrators. Several people were injured when
trouble erupted outside the civic offices in Reading, Berkshire.
   Hand-clapping protesters disrupted a hearing in Bradford, where
teachers also walked out Tuesday to protest spending cuts made to
keep the tax down to 267 pounds ($440).
   A day earlier, protesters dressed as Robin Hood's merry band
invaded the council chamber in Nottingham, blew whistles, tossed
papers and attacked council members with shaving-cream pies.
   Former war correspondent Richard McMillan, 89, who returned his
Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace, said his protest
was not for himself ``but for the hundreds of thousands of poor
people who are worse off than I am.''
   Robert Orme lectured magistrates in Stroud, Gloucestershire that
the Magna Carta, signed by King John at Runnymede in 1215, requires
``general consent'' to any tax.
   ``This government appears to have general dissent,'' he said.
   The average English household will pay 170 pounds ($280) more
under the community charge than under the property tax it replaces
_ an increase from $837 to $1,112, the BBC said Tuesday.
   The figures were calculated by the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance Accountants based on charges already set by 250 councils.

  [Text] The provision of the Uruguay Round to which the 
Philippines committed, to convert quantitative restrictions on 
agricultural products into tariffs does not amend Republic Act 
No. 7606, known as the Magna Carta of Small Farmers. 
  This was the ruling made by Justice Secretary Franklin M. 
Drilon in reply to a query of Trade and Industry Secretary 
Rizalino S. Navarro. Drilon said "the Magna Carta provisions 
cannot be amended by the Final Act of the Uruguay Round." 
  While the Philippines adopts the generally accepted 
principles of international law as part of the law of the land 
in consonance with the Constitution, Drilon said, it has been 
said that a municipal law which is in conflict with a rule of 
international law will often be given effect in municipal courts 
since the latter are organs of municipal law and are bound by it. 
  Citing the Salonga-Yap book on Public International Law, 
Drilon said, the fact that international law has been made part 
of the law of the land does not by any means imply the primacy 
of international law over national or municipal law in the 
municipal sphere. 
  As retired Supreme Court Justice Edgardo J. Paras said in 
his 
work "International Law," in case of conflict between 
international law and the municipal law of the tribunal deciding 
the case, the municipal law shall prevail. 
  However, Drilon said, if the Final Act of the Uruguay Round 
is subjected to the Senate ratification pursuant to the 
Constitution, "our reply to this particular query might be 
different if we are to consider and apply the American 
jurisprudential rule that a treaty may supersede a prior act of 
Congress in the same manner that an act of Congress may 
supersede a prior treaty." 
  Navarro also asked whether "non-implementation by the 
president or the secretary of agriculture of the trade provision 
of the Magna Carta hold them liable for action by interest 
groups."

<HEAD>Edward Kennedy Places a Rose on JFK Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RUNNYMEDE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy laid a white rose
at the foot of a British memorial to his brother, U.S. President
John F. Kennedy, slain 25 years ago today.
   Kennedy today walked across a field and climbed a tree-lined
stone path to the roughly oblong, five-foot high slab of stone that
is Britain's tribute to the assassinated president.
   Wearing a black trenchcoat, he placed the flower at the foot of
the memorial, crossed himself and mouthed a silent prayer.
   Runnymede, 21 miles west of London, was chosen as the site for
the memorial because it was here in 1215 that King John sealed the
Magna Carta, the great charter regarded as the foundation of British
human rights.
   Kennedy came here with three English friends of the family, Dinah
Bridge, Lady Anne Tree and Chiquita Astor, as well as American
artist James Wyeth, painter of a celebrated portrait of President
Kennedy, and historical author Larry Collins.
   The Massachusetts Democrat is in Britain on a private trip and he
visited Runnymede with little advance publicity.
   Kennedy told a reporter the memorial had ``a special meaning to
all the members of the family and I welcome the chance to come out
with some of the close friends ... dear friends of President
Kennedy.''
   ``My sister Kathleen's and my brother Joe's lives were lost not
far from here,'' he said. Kathleen was killed in a plane crash over
northern France in 1948 and Joseph went down with his World War II
bomber over eastern England in 1944.
   Kennedy declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th
anniversary of his brother's death, saying: ``We think it's
extremely important to celebrate the life of President Kennedy
rather than the tragedy. We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and
the hope of his life rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   The anniversary attracted a trickle of British Kennedy admirers
to the memorial. Among the first was Daphne James, 44, a publishing
company secretary who said she needed to be somewhere ``where you
feel you're close to him for a little while.''
   Mrs. James was at home on Nov. 22, 1963, when news of the
assassination in Dallas reached Britain.
   ``I think I spent about 2{ hours crying solidly though I was
trying to get a family to bed,'' she said.
   ``He was special and I want for us not to forget he was a special
person.''
   The memorial, paid for by public donations, was unveiled in 1965
and carries an inscription from Kennedy's own words: ``We shall pay
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or
oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of
liberty.''
   It stands on the side of the hill, not on top, to symbolize a
life cut short before its time.

   TORONTO -- Ford Motor Co. said it has agreed to inject
cash into Magna International Inc., one of Ford's major
outside suppliers of auto parts, in order to ensure a
continued supply of plastic bumpers from the financially
strapped company.
   Neither company would reveal the size of Ford's
investment, but Toronto-based Magna said the deal represents
a "major step" in its program to restructure 1.09 billion
Canadian dollars (US$949.5 million) in debt.
</LP>

   Magna spokesman Brian Colburn called the agreement with
Ford a "vote of confidence" in Magna's ability to continue
operating. Magna, which has been plagued by overcapacity and
a slowdown in the auto industry, supplies parts to all of the
Big Three U.S. auto makers.
   Under terms of the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will
acquire 49% and Magna will own 51% of a new company, Conix
Canada Inc., that has been set up to acquire various assets
from Magna's Decoma International Inc. unit. The assets
include a new 530,000 square-foot plastic bumper
manufacturing plant in Guelph, Ontario. The plant, which will
employ about 500 people after production gets under way early
next year, will eventually replace a smaller facility
currently in use in Toronto, Mr. Colburn said.
   The joint venture company also will acquire Magna's
mould-making plant in Concord, Ontario, which has 130
employees.
   In addition, Magna said Ford has agreed to purchase the
property of Magna's interior component manufacturing plant in
Nashville, Ill., and to lease the facility back to Magna.
Ford also will provide a loan to a Magna subsidiary in the
U.S.
   The pact with Ford is Magna's second significant move to
reduce its debt load since the company announced in March it
was in technical default on some of its bank loans. Last
month, Magna said it agreed to sell its automotive electric
motors division to a unit of Siemens AG of West Germany.
Analysts estimated that deal was worth about C$70 million.
   Mr. Colburn said Magna is negotiating with its creditors
to secure a standstill agreement on the company's loans. He
said Magna aims to cut its debt load by about half over the
next 12 months.

WINDSOR CASTLE is the largest inhabited castle in the world and has been the
sovereign's official residence for more than 800 years.
The original castle at Windsor, a fortified earthwork surrounded by a dry
ditch, was built by William the Conqueror in about 1070 as one of a chain of
strongholds to control the area around London.
It was rebuilt and enlarged over the centuries, although the outline still
follows the shape of the original earthwork.
In 1215 King John rode reluctantly from the castle to nearby Runnymede to
set his seal on the Magna Carta.
Earlier, Henry I was the first monarch to make it a royal house when in 1121
he married his second wife Adelaide of Louvain in a chapel in the castle.
Their new home was little more than a cold and draughty timbered hall.
Each monarch in turn strengthened and added to the castle. The lower wall of
the dominant Round Tower dates back to Henry II, who reigned from 1154-89.
Two kings were born in the castle: Edward III (1327-77), and the gentle and
pious Henry Vl (1422-61), who founded Eton College. His body lies in the
castle's St George's Chapel.
Henry VIII (1509-47) made additions to St George's Chapel and his daughter,
Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), built a gallery which is now part of the
Royal Library.
Work on the inside of the castle was carried out by Sir Christopher Wren on
the command on Charles II (1660-85), although he was not often resident
there.
George III - 'Farmer George', who was king for 60 years from 1760 - loved
the whole of the Thames valley, and since then Windsor's popularity has
never wavered. Queen Victoria (1837-1901) loved the castle more and more as
she grew older.
The state apartments are open to the public when the Queen is not in
residence and visitors can view a collection of paintings by Holbein,
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Van Dyck and Canaletto, as well as important
collections of furniture, porcelain and tapestries. Also on display are
drawings by old masters, including Leonardo da Vinci.

Philadelphia Freedom: Constitution Turns 200

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Philadelphia  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The centerpiece of the Constitution bicentennial celebration here is appropriately entitled "Miracle at Philadelphia." 
But the real miracle on the Delaware is that Philadelphians have given us a stimulating, not snooze-inducing, history lesson. 

   Let's face it: The Constitution doesn't have the appeal of that soaring symbol of freedom, the Statue of Liberty, nor does it warm the patriotic heart like the Declaration of Independence. 
But Philadelphia, with this festival, has gone a long way toward elevating the Constitution to its proper place alongside these other American icons. 

   The first big event of the city's yearlong bash -- a jam-packed agenda of happenings collectively billed as "All Roads Lead to Philadelphia" -- marked the anniversary of the opening of the Constitutional Convention on May 25. 
This Fourth of July weekend there'll be a "Freedom Festival," boasting parades, pageants, concerts, fireworks and even a hot-air-balloon race. 
The fireworks continue on "Constitution Day," Sept. 17, commemorating the occasion when 39 delegates put their pens to the parchment in Independence Hall. 
The highlight that day will be the Grand Federal Procession, which will include a recreation of floats from the 1788 parade celebrating the Constitution's ratification. 

   The best of the Constitutional offerings in this historic city, however, can be enjoyed by the visitor any day this year -- and, remarkably, the crowds aren't bad. 
First stop for all should be the Independence National Historical Park Visitor Center (Third and Chestnut Sts.), the handsome modern brick home of "A Promise of Permanency," a new exhibit that illustrates the durability of the Constitution. 

   Video monitors displaying a moving timeline (1789-1986) are set into niches in a large black-and-white montage depicting famous faces and places of the past. 
To hear commentary on a particular Supreme Court justice or case, you just touch the computer screen. 
Nearby terminals broadcast interviews with experts on divisive issues such as the death penalty and pornography. 
By touching the video screen, a viewer can register his or her own opinions -- and find out how they compare with those of earlier visitors. 
There's also a well-made 30-minute film, "Independence," on America from the Revolution through the Constitutional Convention. 

   A block away "Miracle at Philadelphia," at the landmark Second Bank of the U.S. (Fourth and Chestnut, through Dec. 31), offers a comprehensive multimedia account of the controversial convention. 
Five rooms of original documents, works of art, audiovisual presentations and educational models introduce the visitor, for example, to the Constitution's immediate predecessor, the Articles of Confederation. 
By deciphering yellowed letters and reading original newspaper clips he is reminded why Nationalists such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison pushed for a strong new government: Under the Articles, each state could issue money, levy taxes and regulate trade; Congress didn't have a permanent home or a steady income and was considered weak by Americans and foreigners alike. 

   Once 55 delegates from 12 states did agree to attend the convention, their differences at first seemed only to be exacerbated. 
James Madison's notes on the secret proceedings explain why the negotiations were so difficult. 
The delegates -- representing large and small states, Northern and Southern interests -- bickered over representation in the new government, trade regulation, taxation and slavery -- among other things. 
That they finally agreed on the new document, with its unprecedented call for three separate branches of government and a system of checks and balances, was "little short of a miracle," convention chairman George Washington wrote. 

   A short movie called "The Sound of the Debates" reviews the process of electing a president. 
Also of particular interest are colorful three-dimensional models that use labeled blocks to show the number of representatives each state would have had to the federal government under various proposals -- the Virginia, New Jersey and Connecticut plans. 

   Over at Old City Hall (Fifth and Chestnut, adjacent to Independence Hall), also through Dec. 31, is an original copy of Magna Carta, a precursor to the Constitution. 
The document, drawn up by disgruntled barons in Runnymede, England, and signed by King John in 1215 under threat of civil war, was aimed at curbing royal power and alluded to rights for all subjects. 
This 1297 copy is the only one permanently in the U.S. 
It's on loan from Texas industrialist H. Ross Perot. 

   A 15-minute walk westward from Independence National Historical Park, not far from Philadelphia's modern-day City Hall, brings visitors to a pair of small and informative exhibits. 
"A More Perfect Union: The American People and Their Constitution" at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania (1300 Locust St., through Dec. 14), traces the evolution of the Constitution and public perception of it. 
One original document details the order of participants in the 1788 Grand Procession. 
"Major Pancake, with twelve Axe-men, in frocks and caps" led the march, followed by scores of other citizens, including "whip manufacturers" and "peruke-makers." 
Photos of the 1887 Constitution centennial, depicting high-stepping horses and elaborate floats, are fun to peruse. 

   Next door, at the Library Company of Philadelphia (1314 Locust St., through Oct. 23), is "The Delegates' Library: The Intellectual Heritage of the Constitutional Era," which explores the role of books and the great thinkers who wrote them in the framing of the Constitution. 
The volumes on display cover such topics as: English jurisprudence; the liberal tradition as articulated by John Locke; political economy, particularly the theories of Adam Smith; the French Enlightenment; and America's own philosophical heritage. 

   For visitors with children, a must stop is the Please Touch Museum (210 N. 21st St.), which has mounted a charming exhibition called "Red, White and Blue: Childhood &amp; Citizenship." 
Various displays and participatory exhibits take a look at how Americans communicate national values to the younger generation. 
A placard tells us that "Children used to share far more fully in adult work and play. 
They marched in patriotic processions, sang patriotic songs, attended rallies . . . and even sat through the same tedious orations as their parents." 

   One of the most popular attractions seems to be a simple wooden lemonade stand (presumably it's supposed to show that the capitalist ethic is passed on at an early age) equipped with plastic cups but no real liquid. 
Though the sign says "5 cents," one youngster tried to charge his mom $7. 
Without missing a beat, she pretended to fork over the money. 

   Philadelphia-goers of all ages, of course, can also take this opportunity to visit or revisit Independence Hall. 
And one of the best reminders of the Constitution's legacy sits right across the street. 
When you take a turn declaiming from the podium of the newly installed "America's soapbox," it's hard not to remember that speech wasn't always free.

   John F. Kennedy's family and friends paused
Tuesday to celebrate his life and mourn the dreadful moment 25 years
ago when the youthful president was murdered in Dallas and ``the
heartbeat of a nation stood still.''
   Kennedy was remembered in the salutes of an elite Army unit, in
the simple, graveside tribute of his longtime secretary, in a
private Mass for his widow and children, in a vigil in the Capitol
Rotunda, and with flowers at home and abroad _ including the single
white rose left by his youngest and only surviving brother at a
historic meadow in England.
   Although no official ceremonies were held in Dallas, about 2,500
people thronged Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was felled by an
assassin's rifle as he waved to crowds from an open limousine at
midday Nov. 22, 1963.
   Twenty people clapsed hands along the motorcade route Tuesday,
and a crucifix and two bouquets of flowers were deposited at the
approximate spot on Elm Street where the president was struck.
   A note on one bouquet read, ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22.'' On
the other, the message read, ``After 25 years, we still love you,
John.'' Schoolteacher Jean Hill, who saw Kennedy killed that day,
brought her 50 third-graders to the scene.
   The president's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and her two
children, John Jr. and Caroline, attended a private Mass at St.
Thomas More's Roman Catholic Church in New York City. A spokeswoman
for the former first lady said the family planned no public
appearances.
   In Washington, hundreds of former Peace Corps volunteers ended a
24-hour vigil in the Capitol Rotunda and attended a memorial Mass at
St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, where Kennedy's funeral
service was held.
   Officiating at the Mass was the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, a former
Peace Corps adviser who also took part in Kennedy's funeral service.
Hesburgh, the retired longtime president of Notre Dame, recalled
that when Kennedy was killed, ``the heartbeat of a nation stood
still.''
   He told the former volunteers that if Kennedy ``was here today,
he'd probably say that `you are the people who delivered the message
I gave to the world' and that the Peace Corps `will be my best and
brightest memory.'''
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the president's sister, and a black-clad
Ethel Kennedy, widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who was
assassinated in June 1968, made early-morning visits to the two
Kennedy gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Mrs. Shriver said she hoped people would remember John Kennedy
for ``the high points of his life, the laughter and the vision.''
   Ethel Kennedy was one of the first mourners to appear at the
cemetery when the gates opened at 8 a.m. She knelt silently before
the eternal flame that burns at the president's grave and then
walked to her husband's grave nearby.
   ``I think for the family it's a private moment,'' she said.
``It's a wonderful outpouring of love.''
   Evelyn Lincoln, the late president's personal secretary, made her
annual pilgrimage to the grave and laid three red roses near the
eternal flame. ``It's the least I can do,'' she said.
   About 30 uniformed Green Berets, the U.S. Army Special Forces
unit created by Kennedy, laid a large wreath at the grave. They then
formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in chief.
Members of Kennedy's former White House staff attended a Mass at the
cemetery amphitheater and placed a bouquet of roses on his grave.
   The president's only surviving brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., laid a single white rose at the foot of a British memorial
to the president at Runnymede, England, west of London, during a
private visit with friends.
   Wearing a black trenchcoat, the senator crossed himself and said
a silent prayer before the memorial, a large slab of stone on the
side of a hill at the place where King John in 1215 granted the
charter of civil and political liberties known as the Magna Carta.
   ``We think it's extremely important to celebrate the life of
President Kennedy rather than the tragedy,'' Kennedy told reporters.
``We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and the hope of his life
rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   In the vaulted Capitol Rotunda, where the president's body lay in
state 25 years ago, the last of an estimated 450 former Peace Corps
volunteers or their surrogates completed a 24-hour vigil of readings
and songs dedicated to Kennedy, who founded the overseas development
agency in March 1961.
   Former Sen. Paul Tsongas, D-Mass., who was a Peace corps
volunteer in Ethiopia when Kennedy was killed, told his audience
that ``only part of John Kennedy died 25 years ago. The best part of
him is alive and here in all of us.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who was a volunteer in the
Dominican Republic in 1966-68, said the Peace Corps was ``a living
memorial'' to Kennedy and its volunteers ``will always be our best
ambassadors.''

THOUSAND OAKS: HERBERT STONE HAS AGREED TO COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS 
NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE WILL TESTIFY AGAINST HIS CO-DEFENDANTS.

<P>
One of four defendants accused of stock fraud in a criminal indictment 
involving Magna Technologies, a defunct Thousand Oaks company, pleaded guilty 
in federal court in Los Angeles on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Stone, a former securities broker who made a market in Magna's stock, 
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, seven counts of securities fraud and 
four counts of wire fraud. Each of the 12 counts carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stone is currently serving a two-year sentence in federal prison for stock 
manipulation unrelated to Magna. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Stone's co-defendants, Robert Victor, a former Magna shareholder, and 
Robert Gutstein, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon and Magna's former chairman, 
have pleaded not guilty to the charges and are scheduled to go to trial Nov. 
27. Assistant U.S. Atty. John Walsh said Stone "has agreed with the government 
to cooperate," but it hasn't yet been determined whether he'll testify against 
Victor and Gutstein. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth defendant, Jacob Rubenstein, a shareholder and principal promoter of 
Magna, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
Victor is a convicted felon formerly known as Robert Viggiano. He was referred 
to in police reports from the investigation of ZZZZ Best, the defunct Reseda 
carpet cleaning company, as "a reputed member of the Colombo organized crime 
family." During the securities fraud trial of ZZZZ Best founder Barry Minkow, 
defense attorneys said Victor, a ZZZZ Best shareholder, used threats and 
violence to force Minkow into the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Victor was never charged with a crime relating to ZZZZ Best. Minkow was 
convicted in 1988 of 57 counts of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Magna indictment charged the co-defendants with 42 counts of conspiracy, 
and securities, wire, bank and tax fraud. Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four 
others were also accused of manipulating Magna stock in a related civil suit 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants entered summary judgments in the civil suit, agreeing to stop 
the activities cited in the suit without admitting or denying guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said that in 1985 Magna was merged with Bashney Biscuit, a 
bankrupt, publicly traded corporation, thereby creating freely traded Magna 
stock without registering the stock with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants then carried out a scheme to artificially inflate Magna's stock 
price, the indictment said. The company once boasted that it acquired the 
rights to such offbeat products as a flexible pouch for carrying liquids, a 
battery-operated "stun gun," a device to aid sexually impotent men and a 
hand-held, battery-operated "pain reliever." 
</P>
<P>
The government said no products were produced by Magna during the period named 
in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also said the defendants enlisted the aid of friends and 
relatives who set up accounts at brokerage firms to trade in Magna stock. Using 
these accounts, the defendants drove the stock price up using tactics such as 
"wash sales," in which a person buys and sells the same block of stock, 
"matched sales," which involves two people trading the same block of stock, and 
"free-riding," a technique of placing orders for stock without intending to pay 
for them, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
From March to September, 1985, Magna's stock climbed from 50 cents a share to 
$9.50 before collapsing. The indictment said the defendants made more than $1 
million through sales of Magna stock.

   ST. LOUIS -- Magna Group Inc. and Landmark Bancshares
Corp. amended their October merger agreement, to fix the
value that Landmark common shareholders will receive at $9.80
a share.
   Under terms of the original agreement between the two bank
holding companies, Landmark shareholders were to receive for
each of their shares 50 cents cash and 0.898 shares of Magna
common stock, regardless of the market value of Magna's
common stock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The amended pact calls for the exchange ratio of stock to
fluctuate between 0.62 and 1.033 shares of Magna, if the
average market value of Magna's common stock is between $9
and $15 during a specified 20-day period.
   Magna would thus issue between 4.5 million and 7.5 million
common shares of its stock to Landmark shareholders and the
combined company would have between 18 million and 21 million
shares outstanding upon completion of the merger, Magna said.
   "Under the variable pricing structure of the original
agreement, the recent trading prices of Magna's common stock
would have resulted in an unacceptable level of intangible
assets for the combined company," Magna said. Even with a
fixed price, Magna said, "the transaction is now expected to
generate intangible assets for the combined company because
of current estimates for purchase accounting adjustments
required at closing and the approximately $19 million net
change in Landmark's tangible book value since the October
1990 merger agreement."
   By establishing a fixed value for the transaction, "we are
controlling the probable level of intangibles produced in the
transactions," Magna said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Magna
shares climbed $1 to close at $13; Landmark shares slipped
12.5 cents to close at $8.75.

   Magna International Inc., Canada's largest auto-parts manufacturer, said it is negotiating with auto makers about assembling complete motor vehicles for them. 

   Jerry Barker, a company spokesman, declined to identify the auto makers, but an industry source said they are based in Detroit. 
He didn't elaborate. 

   Magna is looking at producing about 10,000 units annually, the source said. 
Should the project proceed, Mr. Barker said it would be run by Cosma International Inc., a Magna subsidiary formed yesterday. 

   Magna said Cosma comprises Magna's 27 U.S. and Canadian stamping plants and its tooling joint ventures with Japan's Fuji Tool &amp; Die Co. and Mueller-Weingarten of West Germany. 
Together, these operations will generate sales of about $400 million (Canadian) in fiscal 1987, ending July 31, Magna said. 

   Cosma is based in Bramalea, Ontario, near the new unit's main stamping plant. 
Mr. Barker said Magna is considering an initial public offering by the new unit. 

   Magna, which reported sales of $1.03 billion (Canadian) for fiscal 1986, said its chairman, Frank Stronach, also will serve as Cosma's chairman. 
Ueli Spring, formerly a vice president of Magna's stamping operations, was named president of the unit.

   TORONTO -- Magna International Inc. said it reached an
agreement in principle with its lenders to restructure 560
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$485.9 million) of its more
than C$1 billion in debt.
   The auto parts maker said it will continue to cut costs,
sell assets and seek joint venture partners to meet its debt
obligations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the restructuring plan, Magna will make payments of
C$279 million and C$153 million on May 31 and Dec. 31
respectively. Of the May 31 payment, C$120 million will be
financed through sales of real estate assets to principal
units of the company. Part of the payments will go to holders
of C$75 million of Magna Series 1 Debentures. The holders
agreed to extend the maturity date of the debentures to May
31 from the original date of Dec. 31.
   The remaining C$128 million of debt will be restructured
through loans to Magna subsidiaries.
   A "substantial" portion of the amount due to be repaid on
May 31, is already available, the company said. It said it
"has identified further transactions which are expected to
produce the balance of the funds required for the May 31
distribution."
   Magna asked its creditors for help in restructuring its
debt almost a year ago. The company's financial troubles stem
from overexpansion at a time when the auto industry was
heading into a slump and interest rates in Canada were high.
   As part of the consideration for the lenders'
participation in the plan, the company agreed to issue to
them warrants to purchase 2,750,000 Class A Subordinate
Voting Shares of the company, or about 10% of the class, at
C$4 a share.
   The company didn't elaborate on the financing for the Dec.
31 payment.
   In other news, Magna said the trustees of the Stronach
Trust acquired from Magna Chairman Frank Stronach, and a
company controlled by him, 697,929 Class B Magna shares, or
about a 51% voting interest in the company.
   Prior to this acquisition the trust held no Magna shares.
The family trust was established for estate planning purposes
for the benefit of Mr. Stronach and his family, the company
said.

   Magna International Inc. posted a 92% earnings decline for its first quarter ended Oct. 31 and predicted lower net income for all of fiscal 1988. 

   Canada's largest auto-parts manufacturer reported net income declined to 842,000 Canadian dollars ($644,635), or three cents a share, from 10.3 million dollars, or 41 cents, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 12% to 291.6 million dollars from 259.4 million dollars, despite an approximate 5% decline in production by North American car makers during the quarter, the company added. 

   Magna cited delays in the introduction of new vehicle models and problems in bringing certain of its new production plants to full efficiency for the earnings slump. 

   James McAlpine, Magna's executive vice president, said profit margins are expected to improve later this year, but it is "highly unlikely" that fiscal 1988 earnings will match the 40.3 million dollars, or 1.56 dollars a share, earned last year. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Magna shares closed at $7.875, off 62.5 cents. 

   Also, shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday approved a plan that would allow Magna to take its operating divisions public. 
Mr. McAlpine said a major financial institution has agreed to acquire a fully diluted interest of between 15% and 20% in Magna's Cosma International Inc. unit for 50 million dollars, as a first step in possibly taking Cosma public. 
Details of the private placement will be announced next month. 
The Cosma unit makes automotive body systems. 

   Mr. McAlpine also disclosed that following the stock market crash in October, Magna established a program to help longtime employees who are nearing retirement and want to sell their Magna shares. 
Under the plan, these employees can sell their stock to the company at the average stock market price for Magna over the past five years, currently about 20 dollars.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater: 'King John': A Fresh Look at Shakespeare </HL>
<AUTHOR> John Sylviane Gold </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Shakespeare Festival's summer production of "King John" has given many theatergoers -- myself included -- the chance to be virgins again. 
It's not often we get to see a Shakespeare play whose plot, characters, famous lines and legendary interpreters aren't rattling around our brains before the curtain goes up. 
I might have remedied this situation, of course, by reading the play in advance. 
But I couldn't see denying myself the opportunity to enjoy fresh Shakespeare on the stage. 

   And fresh it is. 
A colleague with 40 years of theater reviewing under his belt couldn't remember ever having seen this play. 
It's true that Stuart Vaughan's production, which runs through Sunday at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, amply illustrates why "King John" has been shunned by producers for so long; but it's also true that this play's time may at last be at hand. 

   Nothing will make it one of Shakespeare's great ones. 
It lacks dramatic focus, with three characters all vying for the audience's interest, not to say sympathy. 
And it lacks the soaring poetry that ennobles some of Shakespeare's other, equally sprawling histories. 
But some of the qualities that led to "King John's" neglect in the past also are the reasons we're likely to be more kindly disposed toward it today. 
The play fairly crackles with the kind of intrigue and scorn that give rise to, oh, say Iran-Contra scandals. 
Its multiple betrayals and shifting alliances make it the most deeply cynical -- and thus, perhaps, the most contemporary -- of Shakespeare's history plays. 

   Shakespeare adapted this play from an earlier, anonymous work called "The Troublesome Reign of King John," and the real King John's reign was troublesome indeed. 
At home, he antagonized his bishops and his barons; the latter got even by forcing him to sign the Magna Carta. 
Abroad, he battled the French and the Pope, who got even by excommunicating him. 
But Shakespeare is concerned chiefly with the means by which John struggled to hang onto his crown. 
According to a strict construction of the principles of primogeniture, the kingdom would have gone to John's young nephew, Arthur, upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, who never married, but did leave a son, Philip the Bastard, who figures prominently in Shakespeare's play -- in fact, very nearly takes it over. 

   Philip is everything you could want in a dramatic hero: smart, courageous and, in Jay O. Sanders's rambunctious performance, just barely able to rein in his anarchic spirit. 
The problem is he hasn't got very much to do in the play except comment -- often devastatingly -- on its action. 

   Philip is prevented from being the play's hero by his subservient position; John is stymied by his character. 
Shakespeare has made him as ruthless as Richard III, but not as merry; as narcissistic as Richard II, but not as lyrical. 
John hasn't the force of Henry IV, or the humor of Henry V, or the pensiveness of Henry VI. Indeed, you feel that in King John, Shakespeare finally met his match: a character for whom he could have no sympathy whatsoever. 

   Kevin Conway works hard to overcome this problem, blustering here, whimpering there, practically crumpling under the weight of the onerous crown. 
It's an honorable, competent performance, but one that doesn't succeed in making us care for this unpleasant king. 

   There is yet another candidate for the hero slot in "King John": young Arthur, whose claim to the throne is taken up by the King of France. 
This child is guileless enough to be appalled by the war for which he is the pretext, yet canny enough to stay the hand of a determined assassin. 
The problem in dramatic terms is that he must be played by a child actor, almost certain to be unequipped for the role's subtleties. 

   The ladies in "King John" have a war of their own going on. 
John's mother, Queen Elinor, and Arthur's mother, Constance, are more eager than their sons for the crown of England. 
But neither Jane White nor Mariette Hartley can make the most of her juicy opportunities. 
Ms. White's regal Elinor lacks passion, and Ms. Hartley is stiff and shrill as Constance. 

   The performance problems may well be due to infelicitous direction by Mr. Vaughan, who let so many good actors go astray in the Shakespeare Festival's recent "Julius Caesar." 
And, as he did in that production, Mr. Vaughan is once again setting off great gusts of stage movement -- banners on parade, soldiers in flight, messengers in haste -- that seem completely divorced from what's supposed to be happening in the play. 

   Mr. Vaughan was artistic director of the Shakespeare Festival's first four seasons, and it's perhaps appropriate to note that in its 33 seasons, the festival hasn't yet achieved the aesthetic goal that was set for it. 
Joseph Papp's professed aim always has been to create a contemporary, urban, American style of Shakespeare performance. 
It hasn't happened. 

   From time to time, however, we've been allowed glimpses of what such a style might do. 
One such occasion was the first of this year's Delacorte offerings, "Much Ado About Nothing." 
Directed by Gerald Freedman, another old festival hand, it starred Blythe Danner and Kevin Kline as Shakespeare's hard-headed lovers, Beatrice and Benedick. 

   With these two stars at their best -- Ms. Danner haughty and gay, Mr. Kline dashingly comic -- and Jerry Stiller as a very New York kind of Dogberry, "Much Ado" had a fresh, kinetic verve. 

   Mr. Papp may feel that the formal British way of acting Shakespeare won't do for New York Shakespeare Festival audiences. 
But in a British Shakespeare production, most of the actors seem to be speaking the same language and living in the same world. 
That is almost never true in his. 
With this "Much Ado," for once at least many of the minor roles were up to the leads. 
Don Reilly and Phoebe Cates made a winsome pair of young lovers, and Brian Murray a wily Don Pedro. 
David Pierce was deliciously evil as Don John, and Dylan Baker was a leering Borachio. 
Who? you ask. 
Borachio is the accomplice who helps Don John carry out the wicked ruse that temporarily turns the comedy into a nightmare. 
It's a small but important part -- the kind that's been habitually left to fend for itself in Shakespeare Festival productions. 

   With this "Much Ado" as an inspiration, it's time for the festival to start some serious work on finding a consistent style for all its plays. 
The second year of the festival's Shakespeare Marathon, of which this summer's offerings were nos. 4 and 5, begins this fall. 
Wouldn't it be nice to hope that by its end, we could await the entrances of characters like Don John and Borachio with confidence instead of fear? 
Wouldn't it be nice to think that the New York Shakespeare Festival had made a contribution not just to the city it serves so well, but also to the poet?

   Magna International Inc.'s chief financial officer, James McAlpine, resigned and its chairman, Frank Stronach, is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around, the company said. 

   Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending "until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained," Magna said. 

   Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed Mr. McAlpine. 

   An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn. 
The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years, despite steady sales growth. 

   Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$13.73). 
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$9.625. 

   Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canada's Parliament. 

   Analysts said Mr. Stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company. 
They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization. 

   The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring, assisted by Manfred Gingl, president and chief executive. 
Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment. 

   Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career, with Magna as one of his clients.

MAGNA BACKERS INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four former promoters of a defunct Thousand Oaks company have been named in a 
42-count criminal indictment unsealed by a grand jury in Los Angeles Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The charges, stemming from the rapid rise and collapse of the stock of Magna 
Technologies in 1985, include multiple counts of conspiracy and securities and 
wire fraud. The indictment says Magna was a "shell corporation" with no assets 
that was used by the defendants to profit by manipulating its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the indictment were Jacob Rubenstein, formerly of Woodland Hills; 
Robert Gutstein, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon who was Magna's chairman; 
Robert Victor of Las Vegas, and Herbert Stone, a former New York stockbroker. 
Rubenstein, Gutstein and Victor all held large blocks of Magna shares; Stone 
was the primary market maker for the stock. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was returned by the grand jury March 7. 
</P>
<P>
Magna once claimed to have plans to market such unusual products as a 
45,000-volt "stun gun," an "insta-cup" to make instant soup, a device to help 
sexually impotent men and a hand-held, battery-powered pain reliever. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Walsh, assistant U.S. attorney, said Tuesday that the company "didn't 
produce any products" during the period identified in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four others were also named in a civil suit 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May, 1987, which accused 
them of manipulating Magna stock. The defendants entered summary judgments in 
which they did not admit or deny guilt but agreed to stop the activities cited 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Rubenstein and the others used fraudulent schemes 
to manipulate Magna's stock, including inducing friends and relatives to set up 
accounts to trade in Magna stock to create the impression of interest in the 
stock. However, Rubenstein and the others actually controlled the accounts, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also says the defendants ordered Magna stock without intending 
to pay for it -- a practice called "free-riding" -- and when actual investors 
tried to sell Magna stock, they refused or failed to execute the sell order. 
They also released false and misleading information about the company's 
products, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Magna's stock rose from 50 cents a share in March, 1985, to a peak of $9.50 in 
September, 1985. During that time, the defendants made more than $1 million in 
profits by selling their shares. Soon after, the stock collapsed and became 
virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said Rubenstein is a fugitive. David L. Kagel, Rubenstein's former 
attorney, said he hadn't seen him in more than a year and didn't know where he 
was.

   It was the evening of David Hibbard's last day
as a Peace Corps volunteer in a mud-hut village in Nigeria when his
overseas radio crackled with the bulletin that John F. Kennedy had
been assassinated, and Hibbard's lonely nightmare began.
   ``I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and grief,'' said Hibbard,
now a doctor in Boulder, Colo. ``I stayed up all night listening for
details. I wondered irrationally whether he might have lived if I'd
stayed in Nigeria another year. I cried myself to sleep, exhausted.''
   Jim Hagan of Santa Cruz, Calif., recalls he was a youngster
trying to hitchhike out of a blizzard in Buffalo, N.Y., to attend
the president's funeral in Washington. He never made it, but he
joined the Peace Corps three years later for a stint in India.
   Kennedy, said Hagan, embodied the Peace Corps' ideal of ``helping
others, breaking down barriers ... and promoting peace instead of
war.''
   Hibbard and Hagan were among 450 former Peace Corps volunteers or
their surrogates who saluted Kennedy's memory during a 24-hour vigil
in the Capitol Rotunda which ended at midday Tuesday, the 25th
anniversary of the president's murder in Dallas.
   They joined hundreds of other former volunteers at a memorial
Mass at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, where the Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh recalled Nov. 22, 1963, as the day when ``the
heartbeat of a nation stood still.''
   Americans across the land stood still for a moment Tuesday to
recall that dark day, although members of the Kennedy family said
they hoped the president could be remembered for his life, not his
death.
   ``I think we should think of the high points of his life, the
laughter and the vision,'' said Eunice Shriver, the president's
sister, who made an early-morning visit to his grave at Arlington
National Cemetery. ``Hopefully, someday we'll get excited about his
birthday.'' Kennedy would have been 71 last May 29.
   Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel, appeared shortly after the
cemetery gates opened at 8 a.m. Later in the day, Evelyn Lincoln,
the president's personal secretary, laid three red roses before the
eternal flame. She has visited the site every Nov. 22 since the
assassination.
   Thirty uniformed men of the Army's elite Green Berets laid a
wreathe, formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in
chief.
   The president's youngest and only surviving brother, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., laid a single white rose at the Kennedy
memorial at Runnymede, England, where King John made a historic
grant of civil and political liberties in the Magna Carta.
   ``We think it's extremely important to celebrate the life of
President Kennedy rather than the tragedy,'' Kennedy told reporters.
``We're focusing on the birthday and the hope of his life rather
than dwelling upon his loss.''
   A private Mass was held for the president's widow, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, and her two children, John Jr. and Caroline, at St.
Thomas More's Roman Catholic Church in New York City. The former
first lady made no public appearances.
   In Dallas, no official ceremonies were held, but about 2,500
people gathered at Dealey Plaza to pray silently and observe the
site where Kennedy was killed by an assassin's gunfire as he waved
to crowds from the back of an open limousine.
   Twenty people clasped hands along the motorcade route. A crucifix
and two bouquets of flowers were left at the approximate spot on Elm
Street where the president was struck. Notes attached to the flowers
read ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22'' and ``After 25 years, we still
love you, John.''
   Schoolteacher Jean Hill, who witnessed Kennedy's murder a
quarter-century ago, brought her 50 third-graders to Dealey Plaza.
``I want my kids to know it does not take violence of any kind to
bring about change and that they themselves can be instruments of
change and it can be good,'' she said.
   Some cable television viewers relived the hours after the
assassination as the Arts &amp; Entertainment channel interrupted its
regular programming and played NBC News' actual coverage of the day
minute-by-minute exactly 25 years later.
   It started at around 2 p.m. just after the bullets were fired and
ended in the evening with events in Washington after President
Lyndon B. Johnson landed in the presidential plane that also brought
Kennedy's body and widow back to Andrews Air Force Base outside the
capital.

LIVES OF MARTIN MAGNER: FAME IN EUROPE, TV PIONEER AND ACTIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Magner has lived several lives in his almost 89 years. In his current 
incarnation, the Los Angeles-based director is prepping for the Friday opening 
of "La Ronde" at the Harman Avenue Theatre in Hollywood. From 1939 to 1965, he 
lived in New York, directing television at CBS. Before that, he'd built a 
reputation in Europe as one of the leading directors of modern theater. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Germany, Magner discovered acting at 18. "I had no idea what a director 
is," he admitted in his gently fractured English. "I thought it is someone who 
makes sure the actors don't bump into each other. As an actor, I played a lot 
of ghosts, did many plays by Strindberg, Dr. Rank in 'A Doll's House,' 
Mephisto. I think I was quite a good devil -- a little devil." 
</P>
<P>
By 1930, he was working in an increasingly politicized theatrical community. "I 
hate to say leftist because it was just tremendously progressive, very aware -- 
aware of the times, and completely opposed to the Nazi ideology," Magner noted. 
The general director of the theater, who felt especially vulnerable because 
both of his parents were Jewish, feared the repercussions of his work and 
hurriedly left town. 
</P>
<P>
Officials lost no time filling the post with the half-Jewish Magner. "There 
must be some mistake," he told them. "You can't make me general director; I am 
on both sides Jewish." The visitors produced the 1904 death certificate of his 
father, Maximilian Magner -- a Lutheran. "There was nothing I could say," he 
recalled grimly. "They said, 'You don't know that?' I said, 'Well, my memory is 
sometimes foggy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Magner held the uneasy position until the night of March 21, 1933, (he 
remembers the exact date of all the important events in his life), when he 
received orders to fire the seven Jewish actors in the company. Without waiting 
for the banks to open in the morning, he packed a suit and a tuxedo, gathered 
his hat, coat and briefcase, and took the night train to Vienna. Three years 
later, Magner sailed to America. 
</P>
<P>
He holds tight to many cherished memories of his life in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Such as the time George Bernard Shaw paid an impromptu visit to a rehearsal of 
Magner's radical production of Shaw's "Too True to Be Good" and declared, 
"Sometimes youth is not wasted on the young" before he strode away. Or the time 
Sigmund Freud (amused by a show Magner was staging, in which a Freud look-alike 
psychiatrist fell asleep over his patient), invited the young director over for 
tea -- and, several meetings later, suggested that Magner become a lay analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Though he speaks proudly of his accomplishments -- he was presented a special 
award from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle in 1975 -- there is, even in 
the grandest of statements, an endearing absence of hauteur. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pioneered so much in my life," he said of the early years in TV. " 
'Studio One,' 'Montgomery Presents.' It was a medium that was not yet 
developed. We had to do that. And we could experiment to our heart's content. 
Nobody was looking over our shoulder saying, 'Don't do that' -- because nobody 
knows anything. It was the most exciting direction because it was in your 
hands. In theater, you're backstage biting your nails. But in live television, 
you are in control: You edit while you're on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory retirement forced Magner out of CBS in 1965, and he resettled in 
California with his third wife, Marion Palfi, whom he lost to breast cancer in 
1979. "We 
</P>
<P>
were two bachelors living together," he said of their 27-year marriage. "She 
supported what I did; I supported what she did. She was a remarkable woman, a 
great photographer. Four Guggenheims." He gestures to a volume of 
black-and-white photos, "Invisible in America," Palfi's bold and eloquent 
chronicle of poverty in the South in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"When she was marching in Selma with Martin Luther King, she turned to him and 
said, 'Aren't you afraid?' He said, 'Aren't you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Palfi, a former beauty queen and Ziegfeld star (Magner remembers her face 
adorning public kiosks when he was a young man) effected social change through 
her photos: Robert Kennedy used them in the Justice Department's case against 
the anti-segregationists; they were also instrumental in changing many of the 
country's child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Palfi taught photography at the Inner City Cultural Center, while 
Magner directed several plays there. "He had an eye for detail," said C. 
Bernard Jackson, ICCC executive director. "Most directors just go for the 
gusto. But I learned from Martin to look for the literary quality, to see 
things beyond their most superficial aspects. Also, at a time when other 
directors weren't utilizing multiracial casts, he did a lot of non-traditional 
casting." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, "La Ronde," Schnitzler's 19th-Century merry-go-round of love 
and sex, had been one of the plays Magner staged at ICCC; he felt that the time 
was right to visit the work again. "Not that the play is a challenge," he 
admitted. "But it is a charming show, and I like Schnitzler very much. There is 
insight into people of both genders. It's a knowing show, it's smiling -- and, 
I think, it's a very funny play. Risque, yes." (When he originally staged it in 
Europe, "the audience throws stink bombs on stage.") 
</P>
<P>
After a career steeped in heavy works -- "Genet, Sartre, untold Shaws, Athol 
Fugard at a time when nobody knows of him" -- Magner, whose theater work is 
supported by the local Goethe Institute, is relishing comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, light things is much more difficult than heavy," the director said. 
"Even back in Germany, when I started, I never liked Teutonic acting. Every 
line was filled with unbelievable importance, as unnatural as you could be. I 
never acted this way. And when I directed, I always said to the actors, 'Why 
don't you talk to each other -- talk and listen.' But in Germany, they like 
major against minor, crashing all the time." 
</P>
<P>
A former mountain climber ("The desire is not to get to the top -- anybody can 
do that -- but to get higher and higher, into the lighter and lighter air"), 
Magner appears to be a man at peace with his life. "I came in with the century; 
I don't expect to go out with it," he said calmly. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an operation a year ago, a blood clot next to my brain. Afterward, I 
crawled out of the bed, took one of the walkers and walked till the nurses 
caught me and brought me back. I wanted to live, and I wanted to be well. 
</P>
<P>
"And I am."

European parts maker

MAGNA International, the Toronto-based automotive parts supplier, plans to
expand its European operations by investing about CDollars 100m (USDollars
76m) in an unidentified parts manufacturer.
Magna said yesterday that it was in talks which may result in it buying a
majority interest in an operating unit of the European group, and a minority
stake in a public company within the same group. It is also investigating
several other potential investments in Europe.
Magna officials declined yesterday to identify their target, beyond saying
that it is a large company. But Magna has a history of close co-operation
with German car and parts makers. It already has a 50 per cent stake in a
joint venture with Voest-Alpine of Austria which owns four parts factories
in Germany and Austria. Magna owns another factory of its own in Germany.
To finance the proposed acquisition, Magna also announced plans yesterday to
issue 3m common shares in the US and Canada at a price of CDollars 50.50 a
share. The issue will be underwritten in Canada by a group led by Richardson
Greenshields. Bids have been invited from US brokers.
Mr Paul Robinson, senior vice-president for finance, said the thrust into
Europe was prompted partly by potential benefits in the European market, but
also to cement 'stronger relationships with European customers as they move
into North America'. Magna already has contracts to supply BMW's new factory
in South Carolina.
Mr Robinson said the investment will also encourage a 'cross-fertilisation'
of technologies between European and North American auto-parts plants. A
substantial number of Magna's engineers and other senior managers are
Europeans.
Magna has recovered strongly from financial difficulties which pushed it
close to the brink in the late-1980s. It posted record profits of CDollars
140m on sales of CDollars 2.6bn in the year to July 31.
The share price dropped CDollars 1.25 in early trading yesterday on the
Toronto stock exchange to CDollars 52.25.

   Holds Talks to Sell
   Stakes in 3 Divisions

<LP>
   TORONTO -- Magna International Inc., a financially
troubled auto parts manufacturer, said it is holding
"serious" discussions with two parties interested in
acquiring stakes of as much as 50% in three of the company's
operating divisions.
   Frank Stronach, Magna's chairman and controlling
shareholder, wouldn't disclose the identity of the parties,
but said he expects a formal announcement for a strategic
partnership would be made within two to three months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are in the talking stage with a number of people" with
the intention of forming joint ventures for "a big chunk of
our business," Mr. Stronach said in an interview. Magna,
based here, is looking for partners to take stakes of between
30% and 50% in each of the divisions, he said.
   Magna has four main operating divisions, or systems
groups. These include Cosma, a manufacturer of automotive
body systems; Decoma, a maker of exterior parts; Tesma, which
builds parts for auto powertrains; and Atoma, which builds
interior parts. Atoma already is 25% owned by Japan's
Mitsubishi Corp.
   Mr. Stronach said Magna has little choice but to find
equity partners if it is to reduce its debt. "If for one
reason or another we couldn't find a joint venture partner,
we would sell a {whole} systems group," he said.
   Magna has been in technical default on most of its debt
since last year as cash flow dried up in the wake of a sharp
slowdown in the North American auto industry. The company
found itself saddled with excess capacity, and bloated debt,
following an ambitious expansion program in the late 1980s.
   By selling various assets, Magna already has lowered its
debt that is subject to restructuring negotiations with its
lenders to 959 million Canadian dollars (US$829.6 million) at
Jan. 31 from C$1.03 billion at the end of its fiscal year
last July 31.

   Modern Artists Forget Their History

<LP>
   A great cry has been raised by the contemporary art world
that the tiniest infringement of total freedom exerts a
crippling effect on an artist's creative imagination.
   It's a cry that would be silly if it weren't so rabid, as
any art historian should know that none of the titans of past
centuries -- neither Michelangelo nor Rembrandt nor El Greco
nor Shakespeare -- was ever free to insult and/or belittle
the fundamental beliefs of his church and people. Nor until
modern times did many of them even want to.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The only significant event in the reign of England's King
John was the signing of the Magna Carta. Viewed by
Shakespeare as impairing the power of the Tudor monarchy, he
omitted it entirely from his "King John." A principle feature
of the Battle of Agincourt was the slaughter of French
prisoners and wounded by English soldiers. Shakespeare barely
hinted at it in his "Henry V." Two earth-shaking events of
14th-century England were Wat Tyler's Peasant Rebellion, when
rebels took London and beheaded the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Wycliffe's fiery theological heresies. Chaucer's
"Canterbury Tales," a supposedly all-embracing tapestry of
medieval life, mentions them nowhere.
   Yet, despite these political inhibitions, Shakespeare and
Chaucer managed to produce works generally thought to have
artistic merit. As every schoolchild should know, the female
roles in Shakespeare were played by boys, as the Elizabethans
considered it indecent for women to exhibit themselves on the
stage. So at the Globe theater Romeo had to declare his
passionate love for Juliet to a 14-year-old boy. Somehow he
managed.
   Cervantes, unlike the image of him evoked by Broadway's
"Man of La Mancha," never had a word to say against the
Spanish Inquisition. Far from a dissident spirit "dreaming
the impossible dream," he fought as a Spanish officer against
the infidel Turk at Lepanto, one of the greatest naval
battles in history. Spain's most illustrious playwright, Lope
de Vega, sailed to conquer England in no less a venture than
the Spanish Armada.
   Michelangelo, closer in temperament to some artists of
today, quarreled with his principal patron, Pope Julius II.
Considering himself a sculptor, Michelangelo had little
interest in painting, but the pope had means of inducement
and Michelangelo, under protest, relented. The result of this
tyrannical coercion was the Sistine Chapel.
   Although there had been earlier flareups (Florence's
Savonarola, who carried out the original "Bonfire of the
Vanities"), the censorial spirit made a massive entry into
the arts with Oliver Cromwell. His Puritans, considering the
theater the "devil's workshop," shut it down entirely.
(Cromwell also banned as a pagan holiday Christmas, which
somehow survived.)
   But theatrical censorship in the modern sense was
introduced in England in the 18th century by Sir Robert
Walpole, the country's first prime minister. Much nettled at
the barbed satires of a young dramatist named Henry Fielding,
Walpole endowed the Lord Chamberlain with strict powers of
censorship, both political and moral, which he retained for
some 250 years, doing no noticeable damage to the works of
Sheridan, Goldsmith, George Bernard Shaw, or Oscar Wilde.
   For his part, Henry Fielding took to the novel, wrote "Tom
Jones" and, entirely unembittered by Walpole's attack -- a
lawyer as well as a writer -- became England's first police
magistrate. A strong law-and-order man who thought the
government was indulging criminals, Fielding organized the
"Fleet Street Runners," which became London's police force.
   A sea change took place in the West's artistic communities
in the late 18th and 19th centuries, writers and artists,
beginning with the Romantics, becoming by fits and starts
"adversarial."
   But the great artistic hullabaloos in France, where in
this period the art world became firmly centered, are often
misrepresented by modern activists seeking martyrs. Although
censorship existed, the Impressionists were not condemned for
offenses to decency but, briefly, for violation of artistic
conventions -- and not by the state but by the day's art
establishment.
   What were these Impressionists doing painting ordinary,
vulgar people? In bourgeois apartments? In the open air? In
such garish colors? The brouhaha did the Impressionists far
more good than harm, and Claude Monet's ascent was such that
he became a regular Sunday dinner companion of French Premier
Georges Clemenceau. Vincent van Gogh, whose "Portrait of
Doctor Gachet" was just sold at Sotheby's for $82.5 million,
could hardly have been condemned, as almost nobody had heard
of him. In his lifetime he sold only one painting.
   As for political dissent, when painter Gustave Courbet
sided with the Communards in the abortive Paris Commune of
1871, he was brought swiftly to justice by the Third
Republic. When Jean-Louis Barrault, director of France's
national Odeon Theater, took the side of student rebels in
1968 he was as swiftly sacked by Culture Minister Andre
Malraux of the Fifth Republic.
   Attempts by America's current art establishment to obtain
absolute immunity for publicly funded "cutting edge" artworks
are doubly specious, as the cutting-edge artistic "rebellion"
of our day is in no way comparable to the past's great
stylistic upheavals. There are now, simply, no artistic
canons left against which to rebel.
   Painter Robert Rauschenberg talks of the necessity of
shock to create a "new social awareness," and Roy
Lichtenstein of "suffering the sophomoric to achieve the
sublime." But artistic rebellion today is empty, driven for
meaning to a shabby assemblage of hand-me-down radical
political cliches. As a means of achieving the sublime it is
not likely to have impressed Julius II or Lorenzo de Medici.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain today proposed that a 35-nation summit this fall adopt a
universal code of rights for Europe and North America.
   In a speech to Czechoslovakia's parliament - the country's first
democratically elected legislature in five decades - she also urged
that the 12-nation European Community offer full membership to
Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe's other new democracies as soon
as they have introduced Western-style economies.
   ``If we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the
west coast of the United States right across to the Soviet Far
East, that would give us the best guarantee of all for security -
because democracies don't go to war with each other,'' the British
leader said.
   Mrs. Thatcher also apologized for the 1938 Munich Treaty, in
which Britain endorsed Adolf Hitler's division of Czechoslovakia.
   ``We failed you in 1938, when a disastrous policy of appeasement
allowed Hitler to extinguish your independence,'' she said.
  Although Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill was quick to
repudiate the agreement, the British ``still remember it with
shame,'' she added.
   ``In contrast to 1938, the United States, Europe and, indeed,
the wider world have responded with an impressive display of unity
to Saddam Hussein's aggression,'' she said of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Turning to Alexander Dubcek, whose 1968 Prague Spring attempts
to create ``socialism with a human face'' were crushed by Soviet
tanks, Mrs. Thatcher also referred ruefully to the West's lack of
action then.
   ``The pictures of that brave venture are etched in our memory,
and our inability to help remains a burden on the free world's
conscience,'' she said.
   Dubcek is now president of Parliament.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the first British prime minister to visit
Czechoslovakia, is on a trip celebrating the downfall of communism
in Central Europe. She will also visit Hungary.
   Her visit followed one last week by French President Francois
Mitterrand, whose country also signed the Munich agreement
endorsing Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland in northern
Czechoslovakia.
   A year later Germany invaded Poland and World War II broke out.
   After her speech, Mrs. Thatcher walked to central Wenceslas
Square with Dubcek and President Vaclav Havel.
   The square is the heart of Prague's peaceful November revolution
and the British leader laid flowers at the statue of Bohemian
patron St. Wenceslas - the rallying point for most of the
revolution's protests.
   Crowds gathered despite the drizzle and applauded as Mrs.
Thatcher laid the flowers and then went over to shake hands with
several well-wishers.
   Before leaving Prague for Bratislava, she formally renamed a
nearby square Winston Churchill Square after Britain's World War II
leader. It was formerly named after Antonin Zapotocky, a post-war
Communist Party secretary.
   In Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, she planned to meet with
Slovak leaders before leaving for Budapest late today.
   Underlining her proposal for a 35-nation universal code of
rights, Mrs. Thatcher presented the assembly with a copy of
England's 13th century Magna Carta, which guaranteed basic freedoms
for the population.
   Mrs. Thatcher did not provide details of her proposal, but it
seemed to involve a document guaranteeing basic human rights.
   She said she wanted a ``European Magna Carta'' adopted at the
summit of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe to be held in Paris in November. The conference includes all
European countries, except Albania, in addition to the United
States and Canada.
   Mrs. Thatcher has urged repeatedly that the group become a key
consultative body for the new Europe and its relations with North
America following the collapse of Communist rule in most of the
East Bloc last year and reforms in the Soviet Union.

   Mr. Gingl, 39 years old, succeeds Frank Stronach, 55, who resigned as chief executive to pursue a political career. 
Mr. Stronach will "temporarily" retain the post of chairman, Magna said. 
A spokesman said it isn't clear when Mr. Stronach intends to resign as chairman. 

   Magna, a Markham, Ontario-based auto parts concern, also named James McAlpine to the newly created post of vice chairman. 
Mr. McAlpine, 42, will remain executive vice president and Magna's chief financial and administrative officer. 

   Mr. Stronach, who plans to seek the Liberal Party nomination for a seat in Parliament from Ontario's York-Simcoe district, will continue to advise Magna on charitable donations and employee relations issues only, a spokeswoman said.

   Magna International Inc., an auto parts manufacturer plagued by overcapacity and high spending, cut its quarterly dividend in half to six Canadian cents (5.1 U.S. cents). 

   Magna reported increased net income yesterday for the year ended July 31, but the profit included large one-time gains. 
Magna said in a statement that its heavy capital spending has "resulted in lower profits for the time being." 

   Magna said net income rose to C$33.6 million (US$28.6 million), or C$1.21 a share for the fiscal year, from C$19.5 million, or 70 Canadian cents, a year earlier. 
Sales rose to C$1.92 billion from C$1.46 billion. 
But 1989 profit included a pretax gain of C$42.2 million, mostly from the sale of real estate. 

   Analysts say the dividend cut and earnings troubles largely come from the company's cash flow problems, high capital spending and large number of plants just as the auto industry enters a slump. 
Magna said it spent more than C$1 billion on new facilities and equipment during the past three years. 
Capacity utilization averaged only 50% in 1988. 

   Magna announced the dividend cut and reported its earnings after the close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, where its Class A shares gained 12.5 Canadian cents to C$9.375 on low volume. 
Wednesday, the stock closed at C$9.25, a 52-week low.

   Magna International Ltd., Toronto, said holders of its
public debentures approved an extension of the maturity date,
giving the auto parts maker more time to complete a debt
restructuring package.
   Magna, which has been plagued by overcapacity and a
downturn in the auto industry, said the extension affects 75
million Canadian dollars (US$64.7 million) of its 10.375%
unsecured debentures, Series 1, which were to have matured
last Monday. The new maturity date is Feb. 15. The company
said the annual interest rate on the securities, beginning
yesterday, will be equal to the highest level of interest
paid by Magna to any of its bank lenders; it didn't specify
the level.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Magna initially proposed extending the maturity date on
the debentures to March 31. It also proposed raising the
interest rate to 13.25%. No reason was given for the change
in plans, and company officials weren't available to comment.
   Magna has proposed restructuring more than C$1 billion in
debt. It expects to raise about C$425 million by next July by
selling various assets and finding joint-venture partners for
certain operations.

   aul Klapproth, a spokesman for Siemens Automotive LP, said
"a number of points have to be resolved" before the deal is
finalized. The transaction also would require Canadian
regulatory approval.
   Toronto-based Magna said the Maci Group, with five plants

annual sales of about C$120 million and has 1,200 employees.
   Siemens Automotive, based in Troy, Mich., manufactures

MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, tripled
fourth quarter net profits and expects to benefit from a 5 to 10 per cent
rise in north American car production in fiscal 1993.
Profits for the fourth quarter to July 31 were CDollars 31.3m (USDollars
25.8m), or 82 cents a share, up from Dollars 11.6m, or 41 cents a share, a
year earlier, on sales of Dollars 625m, up 16 per cent.
Two years after a brush with failure, the restructured Magna reported a
profit of Dollars 98m, or Dollars 2.91 a share for the full year, up sixfold
from Dollars 16.5m, or 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were
Dollars 2.4bn, up 17 per cent.
Magna attributed the strength in sales to rising north American vehicle
output and growth in the company's average production content. Magna also
operates several European plants.
Profits gained from higher plant operating rates and lower interest costs.
Debt has been halved to Dollars 274m, including a Dollars 165m convertible
debenture.
Magna plans to apply for a New York Stock Exchange quotation. It is paying a
10 cents a share dividend on the A and B stock on October 16.
Lac Minerals, a Canadian gold producer, is buying 52 per cent of the high
grade Lisheen zinc-lead property near Kilkenny, in Ireland, from Chevron

THREE senior executives who played a leading role in Magna International's
financial turnround are leaving to become full-time consultants.
But Magna, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, says it had signed
consulting contracts with all three.
The company said its focus was shifting to 'operational matters'.
Mr David Copeland, Mr James Nicol and Mr Werner Czernohorsky were
respectively chief financial officer, vice-president corporate development
and chief administrative officer. All three sat on a five-man executive
management committee set up in 1990 when Magna faced bankruptcy with growing
debt and sliding profits due to the recession.
Now Magna says it has drastically reduced debt and will resume 'disciplined
growth'. For the year ended July 31, profit was CDollars 98m (USDollars 79m)
on sales of CDollars 2.4bn.

   Magna International Inc., Toronto, said it plans to ask
holders of its public debentures for a second extension of
the issue's maturity date, to allow the auto parts maker more
time to complete a debt restructuring package.
   The extension would affect 75 million Canadian dollars
(US$64.4 million) of Magna's 10.375% unsecured debentures,
Series 1. The maturity date previously was extended to Feb.
15 from Dec. 31. Magna said its proposal for the further
extension would require 50% of the debentures' principal
amount to be repaid on May 31, with the balance due on Dec.
31.

billion in debt that the company planned to restructure as of
Oct. 31. The company said it is continuing efforts to reduce
its debt, including the sale of various assets.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Called by Carlos Magno the "national 
figure of the year" in the 24 December Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 
newly reelected Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes, a Socialist Party 
(PS) luminary, is now generally seen as the North's "new star." 
According to Magno, Porto, which needed a leader in 1989 when 
Gomes was first elected, identified with the "technocratic 
discourse" of this economist and Eurodeputy possessing a "very 
short political resume." Following his election, Gomes was 
increasingly recognized as a "serious player." It was remembered 
that the late legendary PSD leader Sa Carneiro had asked him to 
join his Social Democratic Party (PSD) on the strength of his 
conviction that "this man will go far." In fact, Lisbon 
politicians no longer laugh when Gomes is mentioned as a 
possible Socialist Party (PS)leader or even presidential 
candidate, Magno comments. The Porto mayor is his own man, he 
continues, quoting him as saying that "I did not leave the 
European Parliament when the Portuguese Government wished to 
push me out, and I do not go where others want to take me." 
According to Magno, Gomes is "calmly" preparing his way south to 
the capital, but remains fully aware that his "vital space" is 
still Porto, at a distance from the seat of government that 
enhances his authority. PS leader Antonio Guterres, who called 
him a "statesman" during the municipal election campaign, had 
nicknamed him "Mr. North" when Gomes helped him wrest the PS 
leadership from former secretary general Jorge Sampaio. In fact, 
despite rumors that Gomes and Guterres will fight for the party 
leadership, nothing points to a duel between the two men, Magno 
asserts, noting that while they may fear each other, their 
relationship also involves sincere mutual appreciation. Gomes' 
real test is still to come, Magno concludes: the sights of a 
winner of a string of regional victories in Porto are now 
naturally set on more important political battles at the end of 
the decade.

   LOS ANGELES -- Herbert Stone, a New York stockbroker, was
sentenced to 30 months in prison for his involvement in the
manipulation of the over-the-counter stock of Magna
Technologies Inc., a now-defunct Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
corporation.
   Mr. Stone, 63 years old, pleaded guilty in August 1990 to
12 counts of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud. Part
of the sentence, imposed by federal Judge Terry J. Hatter
Jr., is to run concurrently with the last several months of a
two-year sentence Mr. Stone is serving for stock manipulation
involving another over-the-counter stock, European Auto
Classics Inc., a now-defunct Great Neck, N.Y., company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Magna Technologies was a shell corporation with few
assets, no business income and substantial debts, according
to an indictment filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney John F.
Walsh. The indictment alleged that Mr. Stone and others
gained $1 million in illicit profits by manipulating the
stock from 50 cents in March 1985 to a September 1985 peak of
$9.50 a share.
   Mr. Stone acted as the primary market maker for Magna
stock, buying and selling the stock on the account of Norbay
Securities, a now-defunct New York firm where he worked,
according to the indictment.
   An attorney for Mr. Stone couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Stone is the first individual in the Magna indictment
to be sentenced. Another defendant, Jacob Rubenstein, 46,
formerly of Woodland Hills, Calif., is now a fugitive,
according to Mr. Walsh.
   Robert Victor, 53, of Las Vegas, Nev., pleaded guilty to
four counts of securities and tax fraud in March in relation
to the Magna manipulation. And Robert Gutstein, 53, of
Thousand Oaks, was convicted of five counts of conspiracy and
securities and wire fraud last month. Both men are scheduled
to be sentenced this summer by Judge Hatter, Mr. Walsh said.
   Messrs. Rubenstein, Gutstein and Victor couldn't be
reached for comment.

   Magna International Inc. said it presented lenders with a
plan to reduce and restructure its debt.
   The Markham, Ontario, auto parts maker said its long-term
and short-term debt totaled 1.1 billion Canadian dollars
(US$949 million) March 31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It didn't elaborate on other elements of the plan, but
said it included debt reduction of about C$400 million
through July 1991, mostly through asset sales and turning
some operations into joint ventures.
   Magna said sales and joint ventures already arranged will
generate C$184 million. It said other divestitures are
expected to generate about C$150 million more.
   Magna said in March it was in technical default on some
loans. It had a C$203 million net loss on $1.41 billion of
revenue in the nine months ended April 30 after taking a
second-quarter charge of C$153 million to write down
unprofitable operations.
   The company said its asset sales would leave it with about
100 factories and "capacity" for more than C$2.5 billion in
annual sales. Magna said results have improved recently,
leading to a "small" operating profit in May and June.

   Do Pro-PCers Set Up Straw Persons?

   Katharine T. Bartlett's defense of the "politically
correct" movement on college campuses has a factual
misstatement that's cropping up in many pro-PC arguments --
that the term "politically correct" was invented by the
anti-PC side, as a form of derision (Counterpoint, op-ed
page, June 6). It is indeed being used derisively, but it
originated as a term of mutual congratulation within and
among the denizens of the campus left. I first heard it at
Yale in the early 1980s, as one of several slogans on buttons
worn by feminist leaders.
   Prof. Bartlett's call for debate is undercut by her
intriguing point that all concepts of "neutrality" reflect a
pre-analytical commitment of some kind. It is scarcely
deniable that claims of neutrality often mask
presuppositions, but if neutrality is a null concept, then it
is hard to see how debate can go forward. Debate requires
some agreed-upon core. That core need be no larger than the
elementary rules of logic, yet even these are rejected by
some PC-ers, as reflecting "oppressive" Western rationalism.
No wonder so much "debate" takes the form of antiphonal
sloganeering and organized intimidation.

   Hurrah for Ms. Bartlett] Finally someone refutes the
hysterical attacks on the PC epidemic supposedly threatening
higher education. At the University of Alabama, where I am
employed, I have seen no evidence that PC is anything like
the threat claimed by you and others. I think it's a bogyman
created by those who want the right to be offensive and
insensitive without being made to feel guilty.
   If women, blacks, Hispanics, Arabs, Asians and Africans
are tired of having their feelings and cultures treated as
marginal, the PC critics don't want to hear about it.
   Efforts to introduce sensitivity and balance to campus
life have undeniably led to excesses. But the main point of
these efforts is not, for example, that
Aristotle-Shakespeare-Hemingway should be discarded as
unimportant; it is that writings and ideas from other
cultures are important, too.

   Ms. Bartlett complains that PC critics attack the
insistence by some "`blacks' and `Indians' that they be
called `African-Americans' or `Native Americans'" and "yet
they take for granted their own titles of `Professor' or
`Doctor' . . . as a matter of simple civility."
   Isn't there a difference, Ms. Bartlett? People earn
academic titles. And when they do, they usually are addressed
with their titles because they deserve the respect of others.
But they would be laughed off campus if they went around
demanding that they be so honored. And when was the last time
a student was threatened with expulsion because he/she wasn't
civil (i.e., failed to use the correct form of address) to a
professor?

   Ms. Bartlett argues that the critics of "political
correctness" exemplify the academy's real problem. Their
complaints and their assertion that classic literary works
are superior to certain others, are, she says, a "smoke
screen" behind which "those who have power" defend their
"privilege" against the "voices" of women and minorities,
from which there has hitherto been "silence." Thus, she
categorizes authors by sex, race and ethnicity, assumes that
authors so grouped represent corresponding political
perspectives, and substitutes calculations of group interest
for intellectual standards.
   Her position is equally anti-individual and
anti-intellectual. It denies individuals the ability to think
as individuals and reduces the complexity of the Western
cultural tradition to a uniform defense of the status quo.
Her claims that Western civilization courses are in
"alignment" with "points of view . . . dominant . . . in our
society" is patently false; yet Ms. Bartlett, a professor at
Duke Law, assumes its truth without evidence or argument.
This adds up to a thumbnail sketch of "political correctness"
-- a malaise Ms. Bartlett evidently exemplifies. By
construing debate over intellectual issues as a struggle for
power, she unwittingly reveals the root cause of the
academy's new intolerance.

   Ms. Bartlett sets up straw men (straw persons?) and then
tries to knock them down. Her suggestion that PC radicals are
only now being heard as a result of "surplus visibility"
requires us to believe the feminist-left wave on campuses
beginning in the 1960s has been silent up to now. This
requires a willing suspension of disbelief, and requires the
believer to have lived on another planet during this period.
   In times past, the liberal-arts community was more than
hospitable to reappraisals and fresh discoveries. It was
happy to welcome new, contemporary authors, until it was
asked to believe these trendy new authors were possessed of
the kind of genius that put them in a class with the
immortals of literature. They were superior to
dead-white-males such as Shakespeare, Milton and Dante, and
with cries of "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western culture's got to
go]" sensitive souls like Ms. Bartlett are trying to issue in
the New Age. With apologists like Ms. Bartlett, I am almost
ready to believe the average female Duke student shuns the
label "feminist."

   I am reminded of an old British limerick regarding the
creation and execution of the Magna Carta. At the end it
reads:
                                                                                                       

   It's on account of that Magna Charter
   As were signed by the barons of old
   That in England today you can do what you please
   So long as you do what you're told
                                                                                                       

   With the spreading of PC, I suggest the following
modification for Americans:
                                                                                                       

   On account of the First Amendment
   That was signed by some statesmen of old
   In the U.S. today, you can say what you please
   So long as you say what you're told.
