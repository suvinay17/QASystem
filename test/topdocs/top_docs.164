<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration whether state ``lemon laws'' should be allowed to
give buyers of chronically defective automobiles more legal
protection than they receive under federal law.
   The court invited Justice Department lawyers to comment on
arguments by domestic and foreign car makers that such state laws
impermissibly conflict with federal law.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant
review to the manufacturers' appeal until hearing from the
government, which could take months.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the car
makers when it upheld New York's lemon law last March.
   ``Congress did not intend to occupy the field of informal
dispute resolution mechanisms (and) it is possible to comply with
both the New York and federal schemes,'' the appeals court ruled in
giving car consumers a significant victory.
   Congress in 1975 passed the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, aimed at
giving consumers more information about the warranties provided on
the new cars they buy. The law does not require that a warranty be
provided, but requires that if one is given it not be misleading.
   The law also permits car manufacturers to require consumers with
complaints about the cars they bought to resort to some informal
type of dispute resolution, such as arbitration, before suing.
   The federal law was not successful in resolving consumer
problems with chronically defective cars, and many states responded
by assing their own lemon laws.
   The New York law, enacted in 1983, requires manufacturers to
give consumers full refunds or to replace defective cars if unable
to repair the same problem after four tries or if a car is out of
service for 30 days or more within the first two years or 18,000
miles of operation.
   The law was amended in 1986 to make any arbitration decision
binding on car manufacturers but not on consumers and to entitle
consumers to oral arbitration hearings.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and the Association
of International Automobile Manufacturers sued over the 1986
amendments. A federal judge ruled that the amendments are
pre-empted by the Magnuson-Moss Act, but the 2nd Circuit court
reversed that ruling.
   The case is Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association vs. Abrams,
89-2026.

<TEXT>
   Washington state's automobile-lemon law, designed
to protect consumers who purchase defective new motor vehicles, was
upheld today by a unanimous state Supreme Court.
   The law had been challenged by the Ford Motor Co., which
contended it violates the equal protection and due process
provisions of the state and U.S. constitutions.
   ``The state's interest in protecting consumers in the purchase
of motor vehicles under the motor vehicles warranties law outweighs
the due process considerations,'' Justice Charles Smith wrote for
the court.
   The case stemmed from Ford's appeal to the King County Superior
Court of a New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board ruling in favor of
Gary Barrett.
   Barrett bought a Ford Thunderbird from Mossy Ford in Bellevue in
September 1985. He went to the arbitration board after the dealer
was unable to repair a steering problem that caused the vehicle to
pull to the left.
   The board ordered Ford to buy the vehicle back from Barrett.
   Ford conceded that the steering defect constituted a serious
safety defect.
   But the automaker appealed, asking that Barrett's claim be
denied on merits and contending the requirement that it repurchase
the vehicle was unconstitutional.
   Superior Court Judge Patricia Aitken disagreed. She ordered Ford
to pay Barrett $7,125, representing the repurchase cost less offset
for use; $7,000 for Ford's failure to provide free use of a
comparable loaner vehicle pending resolution of the appeal; and
$1,750 for attorney's fees.
   In its appeal of tht decision to the state's high court, Ford
contended that requiring it to pay attorney fees and a
loaner-vehicle fee constituted the singling out of ``a class of
litigants and subjecting them to onerous penalties as a condition
of seeking redress within the court system.''
   Ford also complained that if had prevailed in its superior court
appeal, Barrett could not have been forced to pay attorney fees.
The company said that represented denial of equal protection under
the law for Ford and discouraged the filing of appeals.
   Smith noted, however, that the law designates two classes,
manufacturers and consumers, and that the consumer class is not
held liable for fees incurred in an appeal.
   Smith held that the separation of classes was rational. And he
brushed aside Ford's argument that the law might discourage all
appeals by manufacturers.
   He said Ford had not effectively demonstrated that the law was
not rationally related to its purpose.
   ``Equal protection does not require that legislative efforts be
perfect,'' Smith wrote, adding: ``The state's interest in (consumer
protection) outweighs any deterrent effect on manufacturers.''

<HL> Auto Associations Want U.S. to Steer Issue of Arbitration --- Petition Is Filed With FTC Seeking to Clarify Rule On Consumer Complaints </HL>

   Two automobile trade associations, in a controversial move, filed a petition with the Federal Trade Commission seeking to clarify U.S. guidelines governing how and when conflicts between consumers and auto makers go to arbitration. 

   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and the Automobile Importers of America want the FTC to beef up a rule that currently governs voluntary arbitration under the Magnuson-Moss Act of 1975. 
A spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association said the rule has fallen into conflict with so-called lemon laws passed by many states that often define when and how a dissatisfied car buyer can take a manufacturer to arbitration over a conflict. 

   He said the states' procedures vary widely and in one instance, a manufacturer submitted the same plan for an arbitration program to six states and three approved it while three turned it down. 
The trade association wants the FTC to take clearer oversight of procedural aspects of voluntary arbitration programs, deciding which qualify and which don't, among other things. 

   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association filed the petition on behalf of Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. and Volvo of North America Corp. 
The AIA said it filed on behalf of 20 member companies. 

   The two trade associations are billing their recommendations as "aiding consumers." 
But at least one state attorney general sees the effort as a "sneak attack" on state lemon laws. 

   "Today's petition to the Federal Trade Commission is a backdoor attempt to strip car buyers of the legal rights that states have given consumers," Hubert Humphrey III, Minnesota's attorney general, said. 
"I'm already talking with the other attorneys general. 
We're not going to let this happen." 

   The Big Three auto makers are all part of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association but in this case General Motors Corp. has broken ranks with its fellow members. 
While noting that it doesn't oppose the petition, a statement released by GM said: "The petition seeks to pre-empt state regulation of private arbitration programs sponsored by the auto companies. . . . 
We couldn't join the other petitioners without breaking faith with states to whom we have made commitments in recent years."

   A federal judge ruled that New York can require auto makers to provide basic warranties of 24 months or 18,000 miles for new vehicles sold in the state. 

   Two groups representing U.S. and foreign auto makers had argued that the so-called lemon law was unconstitutional because it regulates business outside New York and opens the door to inconsistent rules by the states. 
The auto makers claimed that higher costs caused by such laws would probably result in price increases nationwide. 

   Judge Leonard B. Sand of the U.S. district court in Manhattan, however, said the warranty requirements are constitutional. 
He also said, "There is no reason to believe that the few manufacturers affected by the {lemon law} will not do what logic dictates and continue to pass along the added costs to the consumers who benefit from the statute, namely those who purchase and register their cars in New York." 
Already, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. add a surcharge to their auto prices in New York to cover the cost of complying with the lemon law. 

   But the judge invalidated one aspect of the warranty requirement: He said New York can't require out-of-state dealers to send auto makers written notice of owners' complaints. 

   William Stein, an attorney for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the U.S. and the Automobile Importers of America Inc., said the trade groups haven't decided whether to appeal.

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court will decide the legality
of a weapon the Federal Reserve Board says is critical in
regulating bank holding companies -- the power to force them
to bail out their ailing bank subsidiaries.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by the Fed
challenging the May 1990 ruling of a federal appeals court in
New Orleans in favor of MCorp, a Dallas bank holding company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dispute concerns the Fed's "source of strength"
doctrine, which requires bank holding companies to use their
own assets to help their bank units that are in "financial
stress or adversity." The doctrine was applied by the Fed on
a case-by-case basis until it was adopted in formal
regulations issued in 1984 and 1987. Just the threat of
administrative proceedings, however, has often been enough to
spur bank holding companies to assist their ailing banks.
   In 1989, the Fed told MCorp that it would begin
administrative action to require MCorp and its subsidiaries
to come to the rescue of ailing banks. MCorp responded by
challenging the Fed's authority in federal bankruptcy court.
At about the same time, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
in March 1989 declared 20 of MCorp's 25 bank units insolvent
and in federal receivership. The 20 banks were sold later to
Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio.
   The Fed succeeded in moving MCorp's case from bankruptcy
court to federal district court. In June 1989, the district
court barred the Fed from continuing enforcement proceedings
against MCorp.
   In May 1990, the New Orleans appeals court agreed with the
district court that the Fed exceeded its authority in its
source of strength rules. While agreeing to hear the Fed's
appeal, the high court also agreed to hear an MCorp appeal
over a separate issue in the New Orleans court's ruling.
   The justices will decide whether a bankruptcy court,
supervising a bank holding company in Chapter 11
reorganization, may block a Fed enforcement action aimed at
stopping the holding company from taking steps that are
"unsafe or unsound" for its bank subsidiaries.
   The district court ordered the Fed to halt its enforcement
effort that charged MCorp with requiring two of its banks to
make unsecured loans to another MCorp subsidiary. But the
appeals court said the district court didn't have the
authority to halt the Fed action. (Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System vs. MCorp; MCorp vs. Board of
Governors)
                                                                                                       

   Lemon Laws
                                                                                                       

   The justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling that
rejected the auto industry's challenge to informal dispute
resolution procedures in New York state's lemon law. Lemon
laws, which exist in most states, protect consumers,
especially car buyers, by setting minimum standards for
sellers' warranties.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1986 by the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association of the U.S., the trade group for
the domestic industry, and the Association of International
Automobile Manufacturers, an industry group for foreign
manufacturers and importers.
   The manufacturers argued that 1986 amendments to New
York's lemon law were pre-empted by a 1975 federal law that
sets minimum standards for warranties, including automobile
warranties.
   The federal law encourages the use of informal means,
short of lawsuits, to settle warranty disputes. The law
doesn't require sellers to offer informal dispute resolution,
but it ordered the Federal Trade Commission to issue minimum
standards for sellers that offer dispute resolution. New
York's law goes further; it requires any seller that offers
dispute resolution to give the buyer a chance for a hearing,
to keep additional records, and to rely on personnel trained
in arbitration.
   The auto industry argued that the federal law left no room
for more stringent state regulation. But a federal appeals
court in New York ruled in March 1990 that Congress intended
to set only minimum standards for resolving warranty disputes
and didn't intend to bar the states from giving consumers
additional protection. Yesterday, the Supreme Court refused
to hear an industry appeal, although two justices, Byron
White and Harry Blackmun, voted to hear the case. (Motor

<HL> Law: 'Lemon Law' on Cars Survives a Challenge In Connecticut Court </HL>

<DATELINE> HARTFORD  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut's new car "lemon law," the first ever adopted and a model for other states, has survived an important court test. 

   But the fight over the constitutionality of the law, designed to protect new car buyers, is far from over. 
The Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Association, Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., and 20 other opponents could still appeal yesterday's ruling by a Hartford Superior Court judge to the state's Supreme Court. 

   Connecticut's "lemon law," enacted in 1982, gives a new car buyer the right to a refund under certain conditions, for instance if the same defect has to be repaired more than four times. 
The statute also established arbitration panels to decide disputes between car owners and manufacturers. 

   The manufacturers' group challenged the law as unconstitutional, arguing among other things that the arbitration system deprived them of their rights to jury trial. 
But Superior Court judge Mary Hennessey ruled the law passed constitutional muster. 

   The lemon-law's author, State Rep. John Woodcock, called the decision "very significant" because it could encourage other states to go ahead with similar legislation. 
Mr. Woodcock, an attorney, said he expects an appeal, but he added: "I'm hoping the auto industry will realize the best way to resolve the matter is to work with the states to put together sound model legislation." 

   The attorney for the industry group couldn't be reached to comment.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. illegally charged $100
deductibles to perform some automobile repairs it should have done
in New York State for free under the state's lemon law, a mid-level
state appeals court ruled.
   The Appellate Division of the state's Supreme Court decided
Thursday that Ford was ``unjustly enriched'' by charging New York
consumers the deductibles and must make restitution.
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams contended in court
that the state's 1983 lemon law, designed to provide New Yorkers
with replacement vehicles or money back if their new cars exhibit
irreparable flaws, did not allow Ford to impose the deductibles.
   According to court papers, Ford paid the cost of all repairs for
its new cars during the first 12 months or 12,000 miles. But under
an extended limited warranty, the automaker charged $100 each time
it made repairs to the power train and other major components of
cars with 12,000 to 18,000 miles or between one and two years old.
   Abrams argued in court that the state's lemon law prohibits
automakers from imposing a deductible for repairs on new cars
during their first 18,000 miles or two years.
   A state Supreme Court justice in Albany, Harold Hughes, ruled in
December 1986 that the lemon law prohibits Ford from imposing the
deductibles, but he did not order the automaker to provide
restitution.
   In the 5-0 ruling by the appellate division Thursday, however,
Presiding Justice A. Franklin Mahoney said he and his colleagues
``choose to exercise our discretion'' by ordering Ford to give the
money back.
   Mahoney rejected arguments by Ford attorneys that New York's
lemon law is unconstitutional and that it violates interstate
commerce laws.
   Mahoney conceded that while Ford may not have detailed records
of all customers it improperly charged for repairs, ``it would not
be impracticable to give purchasers during the relevant time period
a general notice and a time period to come forward.''
   Mahoney sent the matter back to the state Supreme Court level to
devise an ``appropriate restitution procedure'' for Ford to follow.
   He was joined in his decision by state Supreme Court Justices T.
Paul Kane, John Casey, Leonard Weiss and Thomas Mercure.
   Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman for Abrams, said the attorney
general's office has no accurate total of how many New Yorkers were
improperly charged the deductibles. But she said it's believed
refunds could total ``in the millions of dollars.''
   Philip Lacovara, a Washington-based attorney who represented
Ford in the case, did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.
   The ruling could be appealed to the state's highest court, the
Court of Appeals.

Question: I have repeatedly had to return my new Chevrolet to the dealer for 
different repairs. The engine computer went out once, stranding me. Since then, 
the engine doesn't seem to run right. The power door locks would not work. And 
just recently, the automatic transmission seems to be making a loud clunk every 
time it shifts. I am worried I have a lemon. I have heard there is something 
called a lemon law. What is it and how do I use it? -- N.G. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The vast majority of problems on new cars, even difficult ones that 
defy the first repair attempt, can be solved without invoking lemon laws, but 
occasionally a car is so badly built that a motorist has no alternative but to 
do legal battle with the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Most states, including California, have lemon laws that give new car owners 
specific legal rights. But the lemon laws require that a series of specific 
steps be taken to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the lemon law, which is part of 1982 amendments to the 
Song-Beverly Warranty Act, is administered by the New Motor Vehicle Board. An 
owner must have a car that's less than a year old and have fewer than 12,000 
miles to use the law. 
</P>
<P>
A motorist must make four or more attempts to have the dealer fix a single 
problem before he or she can proceed under the law; alternatively, a motorist 
must be able to show that the dealer was unable to fix all of the problems on a 
car within 30 working days at the garage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into Arbitration 
</P>
<P>
If these conditions are met, the motorist must contact the manufacturer in 
writing about the failure of the authorized dealer to make the repairs under 
the warranty. At this point, the owner and the manufacturer are ready to go 
into third-party arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of organizations can fill the third-party role. Manufacturers use the 
Better Business Bureau, the American Automobile Assn. or the Automotive 
Consumer Action Assn., which is sponsored through the National Automotive 
Dealers Assn. Some manufacturers, such as Ford and Chrysler, have their own 
arbitration boards. Some, such as Hyundai, do not offer arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions made by the third-party arbitrator are binding on the manufacturer, 
but they can be appealed by the consumer through the state civil courts. That's 
where the lemon law's specific protections come into play. 
</P>
<P>
The law puts the burden of proof on the manufacturer to show that the car is 
not a lemon. If you win the case in court, the manufacturer has an obligation 
to buy back or replace the car. But most cases don't go that far. The New Motor 
Vehicle Board can help resolve disputes between consumers and dealers or 
manufacturers. The board handles about 150 calls per day. Its telephone number 
is (916) 445-1888. 
</P>
<P>
The New Motor Vehicle Board is separate from the California Bureau of 
Automotive Repair, which licenses and regulates repair facilities. It helps 
resolve disputes between consumers and repair garages or dealer service 
departments. Its toll-free number is (800) 952-5210. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently wrote about gas-line antifreeze and said isopropyl is safe to 
use. It seems to me that most antifreeze is methanol. Which should I use? -- 
M.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: You are right that methanol is the most common anti-icing additive for fuel 
lines, but most types of alcohols will work. Ethanol, another type of alcohol 
that is made from grain, also acts as an anti-icing agent. It has an affinity 
for water and picks up moisture throughout the fuel system. By moving the water 
out of the tank and fuel lines, you avoid having it freeze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial Additive 
</P>
<P>
It's best to buy a commercial anti-icing additive that contains the correct 
concentration of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
But unless you have a specific problem with your fuel system, you probably 
don't need to add anything. Major gasoline brands contain an anti-icing agent 
that should provide all the protection necessary.

      For Car Buyers, 1990 Is
   Closer Than They Think
   WANT A CAR of the future? 
A 1990 model car can be yours as early as this January. 

   Typically, next-year models are introduced a few months before the year actually starts. 
But just weeks after 1989 begins, Chrysler Corp. will roll out the Plymouth Laser and bill it as a 1990 model. 
General Motors Corp. will launch its 1990 Chevrolet Lumina sedan in May. 
Nissan Motor Co.'s new 300 ZX sports coupe and its minivan make their debuts next spring as 1990 models. 

   Actually, Chrysler officials say, the company could have introduced the Laser this fall instead of waiting until next year, because production is running ahead of schedule. 
But launching a 1990 model car before 1988 ends would have been absurd. 

   Or worse. 
A federal regulation prevents auto makers from introducing 1990-model vehicles more than 12 months before that year actually begins. 
Auto makers stretch the rule to its limits to attract buyers looking to slow their cars' depreciation. 

   Lemon Law Leaves
   Buyers With Sour Taste
   LEMON LAWS are supposed to protect consumers from lousy cars, but for New York state buyers, protection carries a high price. 

   That's because New York is the only place where both Ford Motor Co. and GM tack a surcharge onto the base price of their vehicles to cope with the cost of complying with the state lemon law. 
Since last year Ford has charged New York car buyers an extra $115. 
GM charges $65. 

   The charges reflect the cost of warranty provisions required by the lemon law, the companies contend. 
The law requires basic warranty coverage for 24 months or 18,000 miles, and prevents manufacturers from charging a $100 deductible for warranty visits during that period. 
Ford's basic coverage ends after 12 months or 12,000 miles. 
GM requires a $100-per-visit deductible after that time, although its basic coverage extends for three years or 50,000 miles. 
"No other state lemon law has extended our basic warranty coverage," Louis R. Ross, a Ford executive vice president, wrote to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to explain the extra charge. 

   But consumer groups don't buy that explanation. 
The surcharge is "an attack on the lemon law by the manufacturer by making {the law} seem like it's a consumer burden," argues the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C. 

   The war has gone beyond words. 
After Ford itemized the surcharge on each vehicle's window sticker, the New York state Legislature passed a bill prohibiting the company from identifying it as a "charge" due to the lemon law. 
Then two industry trade groups sued the state, attacking the lemon law's constitutionality. 

   Last May, the groups won a partial victory. 
A federal court in New York ruled the state couldn't ban manufacturers from telling consumers the reason for the surcharge. 
But decisions on whether New York can require car makers to extend their basic warranty coverage or whether it can ban deductible payments during the warranty period are pending. 

   Station Wagons Fade
   As Minivans Surge
   AS MORE FAMILIES pile the kids into the minivan, more auto makers drop the family station wagon. 

   Mazda Motor Corp., which just launched its first U.S. minivan, recently discontinued the wagon version of its 323 subcompact car. 
GM's Chevrolet division won't have a station wagon in its new Lumina line of midsize vehicles, which includes a sedan, coupe and an "all-purpose vehicle." 
The APV, which is another name for minivan, makes it debut next fall. 
Chrysler's next generation of family cars, the Dodge Spirit and the Plymouth Acclaim, will come in a sedan version only. 
They replace the Aries compact and Reliant "K cars," which included station-wagon versions. 

   Chrysler doesn't think it's "prudent" to invest much money in new station wagons given the popularity of minivans, says copresident Bennett E. Bidwell. 

   Total minivan sales are expected to surge 25% this year to about 744,000 vehicles, putting them above station-wagon sales for the first time. 
By 1990 Americans are expected to buy more than one million minivans a year. 
Station-wagon sales, in contrast, peaked at 1.3 million in 1973, and will drop below 730,000 this year. 

   Station wagons won't disappear, however. 
Chevrolet will continue to produce the midsize Celebrity wagon after it rolls out the Lumina line. 
And Ford plans to keep its Taurus station wagon. 

   A Hidden Cost
   Of Eased Fuel Rules? 

   THE LOWERED federal fuel economy standard for autos will boost small-car prices, an economist predicts. 

   George Hoffer of Virginia Commonwealth University argues that the recent easing of the gas-mileage standard "puts less pressure" on U.S. car makers to offer incentives to boost their small car sales. 
Indeed, while Ford has offered price discounts on its subcompact Escort every year since it was introduced in 1980, there aren't incentives on the 1989 Escort yet. 
And Chrysler has raised the price on its 1989 Dodge Omni subcompact a hefty 10%. 

   In the past, auto makers discounted small cars to increase their sales and thus offset the low gas mileage of their more-profitable large cars. 
Federal regulations set a minimum miles-per-gallon average for an auto maker's entire fleet, so the companies had to sell lots of small cars in order to sell the big ones. 
But now they can sell fewer small cars, because the Department of Transportation eased the corporate average fuel-economy standard for 1989 model cars to 26.5 miles per gallon from 27.5 mpg.

For years, John and Gracie Davis, both 67, of Glendale coveted a Cadillac, a 
symbol that they had "made it" in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But they say their dream of luxury travel turned into a nightmare when they 
finally purchased a new Cadillac El Dorado in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
After only 1,200 miles, the car's computer -- which controlled everything from 
the speedometer to the headlights to engine functions -- began to malfunction. 
Since then the car has been in the shop for serious repairs 22 times, the 
Davises said, with each visit lasting two to four days. At the moment, the car 
is in the shop, with its engine totally dismantled, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't get in the car. It's a hazard," Gracie Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Davises were among more than a dozen frustrated General Motors customers 
with pending lawsuits against the company who gathered outside its Van Nuys 
plant Friday morning to vent their anger. Some of the protesters, such as the 
Davises, have filed individual lawsuits against the company; others were 
plaintiffs in a class-action suit filed Thursday that contends General Motors 
does not honor the California "lemon law." 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first demonstration ever in 67 years, but this car has got me that 
mad," John Davis, a retired computer engineer, said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the lemon law, enacted in 1982, a car buyer is entitled to a new car or a 
refund -- less depreciation -- from the manufacturer if, during the first year 
or the first 12,000 miles of driving, a specific problem cannot be repaired 
after four attempts or if the car is out of service for more than 30 days due 
to mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
The law is administered by the New Motor Vehicle Board. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the refund or exchange, a motorist must notify the manufacturer in 
writing of the failure of an authorized dealer to make repairs and the matter 
is then referred to an arbitrator chosen by the manufacturer. Decisions can be 
appealed by consumers to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Norman F. Taylor said General Motors does not comply with the 
regulation, and he has filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in Los 
Angeles Superior Court seeking damages on behalf of three buyers he said have 
been cheated out of their full refunds. 
</P>
<P>
When customers try to obtain new vehicles, he said, GM fights them "with 
tooth-and-nail tactics," leading to lengthy litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he told one of the plaintiffs in his class-action suit not to 
bother with arbitration because he said it was rigged to favor the car 
manufacturer and to cheat the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ott, GM's director of media relations, denied that the company ignores 
customers' complaints or tries to skirt the state lemon law. He said the 
company's top priority is consumer satisfaction, and that they have an 
arbitration process that allows purchasers to get refunds or replacement 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make them happy with their vehicles," Ott said. "We will do 
everything we can to assist them." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to discuss the complaints or other specific cases. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department of Consumer Affairs said statistics on complaints about GM 
cars and lemon-law compliance were unavailable Friday because of a staff 
shortage. A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Automotive Repair said the lemon law 
itself, with its strict rules on timing, notice and documentation, prevents 
some disgruntled consumers from receiving new cars or full refunds. 
</P>
<P>
The Davises, however, said they cannot get even the basic services promised in 
their warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Their contract promises that Cadillac will pay any car-rental costs the Davises 
incur while the car is in the shop for repairs, but the Davises say they have 
been unable to collect that money. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they said, all they want is a refund so they can buy another car from 
another company. 
</P>
<P>
"After this experience, I wouldn't want a Cadillac if you told me I could have 
two of them for free," Gracie Davis said.

<HL> State Aides Oppose Plan To Replace 'Lemon Laws' --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>

<TEXT>
   A group of attorneys general from 41 states has asked the Federal Trade Commission to reject a proposal that would establish at the federal, rather than the state, level, arbitration procedures for conflicts between vehicle owners and manufacturers. 

   The group, led by Virginia Attorney General Mary Sue Terry and Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III, says state laws "offer consumers better means of resolving automobile owners' complaints . . ." than a program that relies solely on federal standards that the group claims auto companies could circumvent. 

   Forty-four states and the District of Columbia have adopted so-called lemon laws to aid consumers with certain problems related to new vehicles. 

   The petition under fire was filed in April by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and the Automobile Importers of America. 
Neither of the industry trade associations could be reached for comment. 

   The trade associations have said the current multiplicity of arbitration regulations makes it difficult for auto companies to design programs that will meet the differing requirements of different states. 
The attorneys general group has countered that the association's proposal will "harm consumers by making it more difficult for them to obtain repairs for their vehicles."

YOUR WHEELS: 'LEMON LAW' PROVIDES FOR REMEDIES TO OWNERS OF DEFECTIVE CARS

Question: I purchased a new Nissan Sentra nearly a year ago. I've taken it into 
the dealership repeatedly because it tends to stall in traffic jams. I am 
frustrated because I don't think the dealer knows how to fix it. I am 
considering filing a lawsuit under the "lemon law," but I don't know where to 
begin. I understand various groups offer arbitration, but I have friends who 
advise me to get a lawyer. What should I do? -- S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You will find no shortage of books, pamphlets and guides to help assert 
your rights under various arbitration programs and lemon laws. The problem is 
selecting the route that will satisfy your goals with the least headache and in 
the shortest possible time. 
</P>
<P>
In the simplest terms, lemon laws are intended to force a manufacturer to 
replace your car if it cannot be satisfactorily repaired after a limited number 
of attempts. California has the nation's strongest lemon law, known as the 
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, but almost every state has a similar law, 
and the federal Magnuson-Moss Act applies all over the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Song-Beverly law, a motorist is entitled to a full refund or a 
replacement car if, during the first year, a specific problem cannot be 
repaired after four attempts or if the car is out of service for more than 30 
days for any problems. 
</P>
<P>
The law also provides for punitive damages. About half of all cases are settled 
with punitive damages, which can range from $1,000 to $100,000, according to 
Norman Taylor, a Los Angeles attorney with one of the largest lemon law 
practices in the nation. Most lemon laws provide for attorney fees to be paid 
by the manufacturer, and most attorneys take cases on a contingency fee, so 
there is little downside risk for the motorist. 
</P>
<P>
"We have touched only the tip of the iceberg under this law," Taylor said. 
"There aren't enough people who are aware of their rights." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can also go to small claims court, but damages are limited to actual 
losses and are capped, typically, at $2,000. You cannot be represented by an 
attorney in small claims court and if you lose your case, you generally are out 
of luck, because such decisions cannot be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there are the arbitration boards, set up by the manufacturers 
themselves or by organizations such as the Better Business Bureau. In many 
cases, arbitration is a required first step before a lemon law suit. (Lawsuits 
may drag on for a year and a half, during which time you will continue to 
suffer with your lemon.) 
</P>
<P>
Taylor insists that such arbitration boards are not neutral bodies and 
generally are not licensed by state consumer affairs organizations. And they do 
not operate under the strict regulations set down by lemon laws. Such boards 
generally are panned by consumer advocates as well. 
</P>
<P>
Before deciding on a course of action, you may want to read some specialized 
publications. The Center for Auto Safety, a Ralph Nader group, publishes the 
368-page Lemon Book, which contains details on almost every state's lemon law, 
suggestions on small claims cases and information about various arbitration 
boards. It is available in bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Consumer Affairs publishes Lemon-Aid for New Car 
Buyers, an easy 12-page guide to the Song-Beverly law. You can get it by 
sending a stamped, self-addressed legal-size envelope to the department, P.O. 
Box 310, Sacramento, Calif. 95802. 
</P>
<P>
The Better Business Bureau publishes How BBB Auto Line Works, concerning its 
arbitration program. It is available from the Council for Better Business 
Bureaus, Southern California Auto Line, 5800 S. Eastern Ave. 370, Commerce, 
Calif. 90040. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Of what use is a ported vacuum switch? Mine was broken off and the car still 
drove all right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.F.S. 
</P>
<P>
A. A ported vacuum switch is part of a vacuum-operated system, such as the 
vacuum advance for the distributor or the exhaust-gas recirculation system. At 
idle, the switch provides no vacuum, and once the car is under way, it provides 
vacuum to whatever system with which it is connected. 
</P>
<P>
Without knowing which ported vacuum switch broke on your car, its effect is 
difficult to determine. If it is the vacuum advance on the distributor, you 
might not notice any change, but you may be losing fuel economy and 
performance.

<HEAD>State Announces $100 Million Automaker Refund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams on Monday
announced a settlement with 12 car manufacturers that will provide
up to $100 million in refunds to consumers.
   The settlement was reached under the state's ``lemon law'' and
could set a precedent for other states, officials said. Abrams said
he believes it to be the largest refund by automakers in the
nation's history.
   The settlement will provide refunds for all New York residents
who bought or leased new cars after Aug. 2, 1986, and have been
forced to pay for repairs that should have been covered by
warranty.
   The repairs must have been made after the manufacturer's basic
warranty expired (normally during the first 12 months or 12,000
miles, whichever comes first), but before the first 24 months or
18,000 miles, or whichever comes first.
   The state's lemon law requires manufacturers and their dealers
to make repairs under their warranty, at no cost to the customer,
for a period of two years or 18,000 miles, whichever comes first.
   The carmakers who entered into the agreement are Chrysler, Ford,
General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan,
Subaru, Toyota and Volvo. Each company also paid the state $10,000
in costs, for a total of $120,000. But they did not admit
wrongdoing in signing the settlement.
   Some carmakers, such as Mercedes-Benz, were not included in the
settlement because their warranty programs are broader than the
state's lemon law, Abrams said.
   Abrams said the settlement was reached after a ``long-fought
effort'' of four years to get the auto manufacturers to agree on
the terms.
   Within the next month, the automakers will place advertisements
in major New York newspapers detailing the refund plan. The ads
will run for six weeks and consumers have 4{ months to respond.
   ``What happens in New York becomes very important to the rest of
the nation and we may see other states taking a look at this,''
Abrams said.
   Since the state's lemon law was expanded in 1986, a record $60
million has been recovered on behalf of consumers, Abrams said.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Motors Corp. repurchased nearly 400
defective cars under the state's ``lemon law'' and then allowed
dealers to resell them without warning buyers of their past
problems, according to state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The company agreed to make up to $2 million in refunds in a
settlement with the state, Abrams said Thursday. He called the case
``one of the more flagrant violations of the law I've ever seen.''
   Chrysler and American Motors, a Chrysler subsidiary, repurchased
the cars from consumers who won arbitration cases against the
companies under the ``lemon law,'' Abrams said.
   That law defines a car as defective if a problem persists after
four repair attempts or if a car spends a total of 30 days in a
dealer's garage within 18 months of purchase.
   Abrams said the company turned around and resold the cars
without notifying the new buyers of their histories. He also said
Chrysler failed to notify the state Department of Motor Vehicles
that it had repurchased the ``lemons,'' as required by law. That
would have allowed the agency to issue new titles for the cars that
would have alerted used-car buyers of the problems.
   ``Consumers who buy cars are entitled to know of the car's lemon
history,'' said Abrams. ``Chrysler failed to provide this essential
information, which would have allowed consumers to make an
intelligent choice.''
   Chrysler, which admitted no wrongdoing in settling the case,
agreed to pay the state $100,000 in legal costs.
   Under the settlement, Chrysler will offer 205 consumers who
purchased defective cars since last September the option of
returning the cars for a full refund or accepting a $1,000 cash
payment and a 12-month, 12,000-mile service contract.
   Customers who take the service contract option will be entitled
to free repair of any exisiting conditions and reimbursement for
previously documented repairs.
   An additional 185 consumers who purchased lemons between Aug. 2,
1986, and Aug. 31, 1987, will receive $750 cash awards plus the
service contract, free repairs and reimbursement for previous
repairs.
   Chrysler will mail notices to car owners by Oct. 8 and owners
will have 30 days to exercise their option.

<HL> Connecticut Files Complaint on GM Under 'Lemon' Law </HL>

<CO> GM </CO>
<IN> AUT </IN>
<TEXT>
   The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles has filed a complaint against General Motors Corp., alleging that the No. 1 auto maker violated a reporting requirement in the state's so-called "lemon" law. 

   Under an amendment to the law adopted in July 1987, auto makers are supposed to notify the department of any vehicle that they repurchase because of a defect or problem that isn't repaired to the owner's satisfaction. 
Companies and dealers can resell these vehicles only if the problem is disclosed to potential buyers or repaired and approved by the department. 

   A department spokesman said the agency hasn't been notified of any repurchases since the statute was amended, despite the fact that "roughly 400" vehicles have been declared lemons under the state's arbitration program in the past 11 months. 

   He said the department filed its complaint against GM because it discovered during an investigation that GM had sold unreported cars to dealers at a company-sponsored auction. 
He said the investigation was prompted by recent reports in the Hartford Courant that some consumers had unknowingly purchased vehicles that had been declared lemons. 

   State officials said they are looking into the allegations raised by the Courant. 
They also said they are continuing the investigation to determine whether other manufacturers or dealers have violated the requirement that repurchased vehicles be reported to the motor vehicle department. 

   GM hasn't yet received "a formal citation" or "any informal inquiry" about the matter, said a spokesman in Detroit. 
But GM considers the problem "basically a misunderstanding regarding administrative procedures" and hopes to resolve it before a July 21 administrative hearing. 
The fact that no company has provided information about repurchased cars "may be because the state has not yet provided direction about how that portion of the law should be carried out," he said. 

   He added that GM's practice in Connecticut has been to repair repurchased vehicles and then resell them to dealers at auction, clearly identifying the vehicles as repurchased by special "literature" and window stickers. 
"We would hope that dealers would disclose that information" to potential customers, he said.

      A Cold Shoulder
   To Longer-Term Loans
   CONSUMERS ARE shunning extended-term car loans despite the lower monthly payments. 

   Volvo Cars of North America says only about 100 buyers have signed up for the 10-year auto loans it introduced with much fanfare in February. 
"We've only done one here," says Kelly Coghill, assistant sales manager at Don Beyer Volvo in Falls Church, Va. 

   One hurdle is the required 20% to 25% down payment on the loans. 
Interest rates also can be as much as three percentage points higher on the 10-year loans than on traditional five-year loans. 

   The monthly payment on a $22,755 Volvo 740 GLE, financed for 10 years at 11.25%, would be roughly $250 a month, after a 21% down payment. 
Buyers making the same down payment with a five-year loan at 9.5% would pay about $377 a month. 
The catch: Total interest payments on the 10-year deal are significantly higher -- $12,036 compared with $4,673. 

   Chrysler Corp., the only other major auto maker to offer extended contracts on a regular basis, also hasn't found many takers for the six-year loans on its minivans; only about 7% of all minivan buyers in the year ended March 31 opted for these loans. 

   Volvo and Chrysler say, however, that the programs are attracting customers who ultimately choose another form of financing. 
"Our motivation is not to sell 10-year contracts," says a Volvo spokesman. 
"Our motivation is to sell cars, and at least it is an attention-getter." 

   Used-Car Buyers Get
   A Little More Protection
   LEMON LAWS are spreading slowly to used cars. 
About 45 states have such regulations covering new-vehicle sales. 
Now, Massachusetts and Minnesota soon will join the District of Columbia, Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut in adopting laws that require warranties for used cars and trucks. 

   The Massachusetts law, which takes effect July 1, covers vehicles that cost $700 or more and have less than 125,000 miles at the time of sale. 
The Minnesota law applies, starting Aug. 1, to vehicles that are less than eight years old, have been driven less than 75,000 miles and have sticker prices of at least $3,000. 

   Most laws guarantee buyers a warranty of at least 30 days on specified parts. 
All also outline the criteria under which a vehicle would be considered a "lemon "usually a problem that isn't repaired after a certain number of days or trips to the dealer. 

   Many car dealers oppose the laws. 
Some complain the laws unfairly exclude sales by individuals. 
Others argue that the laws will force up the prices of used cars. 
And in some cases, state officials fight the laws because they're afraid enforcement will require too much work. 

   Regulators also fear loopholes. 
The $700 cutoff in Massachusetts may lead to "a lot of cars sold for $699," says attorney Paul Gromer of the state consumer affairs office. 

   Boost for Critics
   Of 'Option Packages'
   CAR BUYERS upset about the proliferation of costly car and truck "option packages" are getting a big and vocal ally -- the National Association of Fleet Administrators. 

   The group's members buy about a million vehicles a year. 
And some don't like being required to take, say, tinted glass when they buy air conditioning, or a tilt steering wheel with an automatic transmission. 
Such "packaging" of options has greatly increased because it simplifies the production process -- and thus, say auto makers, improves vehicle quality while cutting costs. 

   But the fleet association, like many individual buyers, complains that the price "discounts" attached to the packages often don't offset the extra cost of unwanted features. 
And often "the packages are very difficult to interpret," says association President Frank W. Kraus, automotive fleet manager for the Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group's Lever Brothers Co. unit. 
"A car may have package A, B and C . . . but A is part of B and B is part of C." 

   The association has discussed the problem with the Big Three, asking the companies to "rethink how they're doing this," Mr. Kraus says. 
One "solution" could be yet more packages -- designed especially for fleet needs. 

   The High Price
   Of Indy 500 Fame
   AUTO MAKERS love to brag that their cars have been picked to pace the Indianapolis 500 race over the Memorial Day weekend. 

   "It's no wonder the all-new Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme was chosen to be the Pace Car for the 1988 Indianapolis 500," boasts a recent Olds ad. 

   But the "honor" isn't cheap. 
In fact, it's so expensive that some companies have been known to decline the opportunity because they didn't feel it worth the price. 

   Olds, for instance, must provide the two specially engineered cars that actually start the race, as well as the clones used in parades and the dozens of courtesy vehicles for celebrities and race officials. 

   In all, about 120 cars. 
And then there's the advertising space the pace-car company must buy in the race program and around the track. 

   "You have to look at it as a promotion," says B.F. "Moon" Mullins, sales and marketing spokesman for Chrysler, whose LeBaron convertible was the 1987 pace car. 

   Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which sponsors the race, declines to comment on its selection criteria. 
And for its part, General Motors Corp.'s Oldsmobile division says its pace-car status is an honor. 
"It's not something that's doled out rather capriciously," says Olds spokesman Mark Rollinson. 
He adds that Olds is willing to pay the cost -- which it won't specify -- for the exposure. 
The May 29 event is expected to attract more than 300,000 fans and will be televised to some 40 million people.

<HL> Chrysler Will Settle New York's Claims Over Consumer Law </HL>

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will give New York consumers as much as $2 million in compensation, state officials said, to settle claims that the car maker sold cars it had earlier repurchased under the state's "lemon law" without proper disclosure. 

   The announcement comes just over a year after Chrysler was indicted for selling as new more than 60,000 cars and trucks that had been tested with the odometers disconnected. 
The auto maker eventually agreed to pay $16 million to owners across the country in that case. 

   New York's so-called lemon law requires auto makers to repurchase vehicles if they have been in the repair shop for at least 30 days in the first 18 months of ownership, or if a problem persists after four attempts to fix it. 
The companies often repair the cars and re-sell them. 
But the law requires the companies to tell potential buyers of the earlier problems. 

   An investigation by the New York state attorney general's office concluded that in about 400 cases Chrysler re-sold the vehicles, but didn't disclose their history. 
Under the settlement, Chrysler will give 205 consumers who purchased their vehicles after September 1987 the option of returning the cars for a full refund or accepting a $1,000 cash payment and a 12-month, 12,000 mile service contract. 
Chrysler also will refund past repair bills of customers who select the service contract. 

   Some 187 customers who purchased their vehicles between Aug. 2, 1986, and Aug. 31, 1987, will receive $750 and the same extended service agreement from Chrysler. 
The auto maker also will refund the consumers' previous repair bills. 

   A Chrysler spokesman said the incidents resulted from "completely inadvertant human error," and added that the settlement the company agreed to, "went well beyond the letter of the law." 
By the agreement Chrysler admitted no wrongdoing, but the company has paid New York state $100,000 to cover legal costs. 
The state said the settlement could total $2 million, but Chrysler estimated the total payout at $1.1 million. 

   State officials said they didn't have any consumer complaints, but wanted to investigate what happened to cars repurchased under the lemon law. 
They added that other auto makers also had similar violations, but Chrysler was singled out because it had the most. 
The officials declined to say whether they will announce similar agreements with other auto companies. 

   The Chrysler spokesman said that the company sells 200,000 cars a year in New York and that fewer than 0.1% are considered defective.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Protect Alabama Car Dealers from Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to protect
Alabama car dealers from being sued by customers who say they were
sold a lemon.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand an Alabama
Supreme Court ruling that such car buyers can sue even if they
signed contracts saying all disputes will be referred to binding
arbitration.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear
arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   Jack and Juanita Warren, residents of St. Clair County, Ala.,
sued a Birmingham car dealership, Jim Skinner Ford Inc., in 1987
after experiencing what they said were numerous problems with the
new car they had bought three months before.
   The sales contract the Warrens had signed called for binding
arbitration of any dispute.
   Jim Skinner Ford immediately sought to freeze the lawsuit until
arbitration was completed, contending such action was required
under the Federal Arbitration Act.
   In past decisions, the nation's highest court has ruled that the
federal law precludes a state court proceeding over an alleged
breach of contract if the disputed contract affected interstate
commerce and contained an arbitration clause.
   A state trial judge granted the dealership's request but last
July 7 the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the federal law did not
require freezing the Warrens' lawsuit.
   The state court said the sale of a car by an Alabama dealer to
Alabama residents is not covered by the federal arbitration law
because the two contracting parties did not comtemplate
``substantial interstate activity.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Jim Skinner Ford
argued that Congress never intended the federal law to be so
narrowly confined.
   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted by two associations representing over 1,000 car
dealerships in Alabama. They said the state Supreme Court ruling
deprives car dealers of their right to enforce arbitration
agreements.
   Lawyers for the Warrens urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   They said the federal arbitration law's provisions ``never were
intended to apply to contracts ... involving the consumer purchase
of a product by a citizen of one state from a retailer residing in
the same state.''
   The case is Jim Skinner Ford vs. Warren, 89-567.

   AMERICA'S APPETITE for bigger cars hasn't been killed by
the recent surge in gasoline prices, but some auto makers say
there is increased interest in their tiniest gas misers.
   August sales of the Daihatsu Charade -- which averages
nearly 42 miles a gallon in government tests -- have risen
about 20% from a year earlier and 40% from July of this year,
says Daihatsu Motor, which expects to sell 1,600 to 1,700
Charades this month.
   Dealer orders for the 1991-model Suzuki Swift picked up
sharply this month, Suzuki Motor reports. In addition, some
dealers are beginning to advertise Swifts -- which average 48
miles a gallon -- Suzuki says.
   Still, most customers steer away from these high-mileage
minicars, dealers say. "People who come in are concerned
about gas prices, but they're still buying the bigger car,"
says Jerry Presley, a salesman at Lapointe Honda in
Charlotte, N.C.
                                                                                                       

   Auto Makers Selective
   In Rankings They Tout
                                                                                                       

   QUOTING consumer surveys is all the rage in auto
advertising. But ads based on survey results aren't always
reliable guides for shoppers.
   Consider the full-page ads General Motors' Chevrolet
division is running in various newspapers trumpeting a survey
that found its Lumina Coupe to be the "most trouble-free car
in its class."
   In fact, the Lumina Coupe's quality during the first three
months of ownership is worse than the average for all cars on
the market, according to a recent survey by J.D. Power &amp;
Associates, an Agoura Hills, Calif., market researcher. The
Lumina averages 147 problems per 100 cars, compared with the
overall average 142 problems per 100 cars.
   Fortunately for Chevrolet, the Power survey has another
way of ranking cars that views the Lumina in a more
flattering light.
   When compared only with the six other domestic, midsized
coupes that make up the "midsize specialty" class, the Lumina
shines -- sort of. It has nine fewer defects on average than
the second-place finisher in the class, GM's Buick Regal
coupe.
   Chevy's ad doesn't tell consumers that the Lumina Coupe's
quality score is below the industry average. But Chevrolet
and J.D. Power's William Fleming say the ad isn't misleading.
Buyers interested in the Lumina typically compare it with
similar domestic rivals, and "among that competitive set,
this model happens to be the best, as far as initial
quality," Mr. Fleming says.
   Chevy isn't alone in selectively quoting Power surveys.
Consider the ads Honda Motor's Acura division is running to
tout its fourth straight first-place finish in Power's
Customer Satisfaction Index. Acura's ad names the top three
brands for 1987-1989: Acura, Mercedes-Benz and Honda. But for
1990, Acura shows only the top two brands: itself and
Mercedes. Conveniently omitted is this year's No. 3 finisher,
Toyota. Honda dropped to No. 5.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Cars Graded
   Highest by Students
                                                                                                       

   ONLY 40% of U.S. college students plan to buy a new car
made by one of the Big Three U.S. auto makers, says a
recently released survey that indicates Detroit's
market-share decline is likely to continue.
   A majority of 1,024 students surveyed this spring by Roper
Campus Reports said foreign cars are more fun to drive and
offer better workmanship, fuel economy, styling and
reliability than their Detroit counterparts.
   The only area where American cars win out: ease of repair.
   Despite what they say about purchase plans, however, some
57% of the students owning cars have American cars now. But
that is down six percentage points from a similar Roper
survey two years earlier. During the same period, the number
of students owning Asian nameplate cars rose six percentage
points to 30%.
   Though many of the students dream of owning sporty
European makes such as Porsche, BMW or Ferrari, the single
most popular car brand is as American as, well, baseball, hot
dogs and apple pie. Some 10% of the students say the car they
would most enjoy owning is a Chevrolet.
   That varies by region, however. Students in the Midwest
are twice as likely to name Chevrolet as those in the West.
Chevrolet was also the favorite of adults in a 1989 Roper
survey, when 15% picked Chevy as their top choice.
   People get more practical as they get older, the survey
also shows. More than half the students say they would most
enjoy owning a sports car or convertible; among adults, they
were named by only one in four.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   GM IS GOING nationwide with a program to satisfy
disgruntled customers before they file complaints under state
lemon laws. The move comes after a yearlong experiment in
Massachusetts during which the auto maker opted to settle
most lemon-law claims, rather than fight them as in the past.
The results: Only one Chevrolet owner has been accepted for
arbitration under the Massachusetts lemon law so far this
year. That compares with 180 Chevy owners accepted for
arbitration for all of 1988. . . . Ford Motor, meanwhile, is
trying to make it easier for customers to call in their
comments. In 1988, Ford began replacing its regional
customer-service offices with a central office in Detroit
having a single 800 telephone number. Before the new setup,
only 54% of callers got through to a representative. Now,
Ford says 95% do. In addition to car-owner gripes, operators
will answer general questions about the company. One recent
query: how many Mustang convertibles were built in 1966? The
answer: 72,119.

LEGAL VIEW: HEY MOM: I'M BEING TAUGHT BY A '57 CHEVY

Students at Culver City High School are learning about the law in an unusual 
educational project sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation and the 
Beverly Hills Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare enough that high school students are offered classes about legal 
principles, but what makes this project even more interesting is the "vehicle" 
being used to teach the law: a 1957 blue Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Louis M. Brown, 80, first had the idea for the course nearly 30 years 
ago, when his children were in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, anybody can teach all of the law that a high school 
youngster can possibly absorb using the automobile as the central theme." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who helped pioneer the preventive law movement and who is the author of 
several legal books, wrote an outline for a textbook based on his idea, but he 
couldn't attract any interest among publishers. So the idea sat in the back of 
his mind until last year, when he found himself next to Kathryn Ballsun, the 
new president of the Beverly Hills Bar Assn., at a luncheon in his honor. He 
mentioned the idea to her, and as he puts it, she "went running with it." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-week, one-day-a-week course, taught by several volunteer attorneys, 
began at Culver City High School in February and will move to Santa Monica High 
School this month. 
</P>
<P>
Ballsun says her goal is for school districts across the country to pick up the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum uses the purchase, repair and operation of a blue '57 Chevy to 
illustrate these legal concepts: basic legal rights (the right to own property, 
to seek redress through the courts); contract law (the purchase of a car is a 
contract); automobile insurance; consumer rights (lemon laws, repairs), and 
criminal law (tickets, arrest). 
</P>
<P>
"The students love it," Ballsun says. "The law becomes something living and 
vital for them, rather than abstract principles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal," she continues, "is to expose high school students in a positive way 
to the concept of laws and how important they are in their daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
The handouts given each student at the beginning of the course demonstrate the 
pervasive impact the law can have on even a high school student. Included are 
an automobile purchase agreement, a manufacturer's warranty, a loan and 
security agreement (this allows the bank to repossess the car if you don't pay 
your car payment), a traffic ticket form, and a criminal complaint (the legal 
document that sets forth the crime with which a defendant is charged). 
</P>
<P>
And, no matter what your age, you'd be doing pretty well if you could 
understand all that.

<HL> Winnebago's Breakdown-Prone Diesels Assailed by Owners and Consumer Groups </HL>
<AUTHOR> Robert L. Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> WGO </CO>

<TEXT>
   In 1983, Winnebago Industries Inc. introduced its new line of sleek, diesel-powered motor homes, promising a "new era" for recreational vehicles. 

   It was an era that many recreational-vehicle owners came to regret. 
The vehicles turned out to be trouble-plagued machines that can go through diesel engines and transmissions as fast as some cars go through mufflers or cheap tires. 

   The vehicles' names aren't exactly household words: the Winnebago LeSharo, the Itasca Phasar, and a van version called the Centauri. 

   But the Center for Auto Safety says the Winnebago diesels may have the highest percentage of defects of any vehicle since 1969, when the nonprofit consumer group was formed. 
The center estimates that of the 7,800 Winnebago diesels sold before the line was dropped in 1986, one in two is a "mechanical lemon." 
Clarence M. Ditlow III, executive director, says the ratio of problem vehicles rivals only that of the diesel cars made by General Motors Corp. in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 

   The Winnebago diesel line is "one of the worst, if not the worst," of all vehicles, Mr. Ditlow says. 
The center is demanding that Winnebago set up a $100 million fund to compensate diesel owners. 

   Automobile Warranty Corp. says the vehicles are such lemons that it stopped selling service contracts for them in late 1986. 
The Wheat Ridge, Colo., company says it was having to pay claims on at least 80% of all the policies it sold for the vehicles. 
Paul Redd, sales administrator and vice president, says those claims distorted its overall financial picture. 

   Even Winnebago diesels with impeccable maintenance records are plagued by the problems, says Brian Hochhalter, an Automobile Warranty claims adjuster. 
"It's not customer abuse or negligence," he says. 

   Larry Ritze, claims manager for General Mechanical Service Corp. in Mesa, Ariz., says his company also is considering halting the sale of warranty coverage on the diesels, "basically because the losses are so high on them." 

   Owners are so mad that they've talked about forming a caravan to Winnebago headquarters in Forest City, Iowa, to stage a mass protest. 
That could be difficult, though. 
Gene Buckley of Wilmington, Del., for one, says he doubts his LeSharo would make it past Pennsylvania. 

   A typical owner experience: Howard I. Peach says his 1985 Phasar broke down on the way to his mother's funeral, leaving a puff of black smoke and a panel full of red warning lights. 
The tab for a rebuilt diesel engine and turbocharger: $4,300. 
The odometer read 27,000 miles. 

   Similar stories are told by other owners, who spent $20,000 to $30,000 for the vehicles. 
"This dream has become a nightmare for anyone who has owned these things," says former diesel LeSharo owner Richard J. Pelletier, Wilbraham, Mass. 

   The problems aren't limited to the engine and transmission. 
Owners also have complained about turbochargers, bearings, brakes and speedometers, among other things. 
But the main problem appears to center around the Renault-built power train Winnebago selected to use in the LeSharo, Phasar and Centauri. 
Critics say it simply isn't powerful enough to handle the diesel vehicles' three-ton load. 

   The complaints come at a bad time for Winnebago. 
Production problems on the company's assembly lines over the summer led to lost sales, the dismissal of the chief executive officer, and a dismal fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 27. 

   Frank Rotta, a Winnebago spokesman and member of its management committee, acknowledges the company had problems with the diesel engines purchased from Renault, but he declines to elaborate. 
He does say, however: "We've taken our warranty obligations very seriously here and feel we've fulfilled all terms of requirements under the warranty." 
The warranty covers 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first. 

   Mr. Rotta won't comment further, citing "some litigation" over the matter with owners. 
He says Winnebago stopped selling the diesel models after 1986 because of low demand and instead began offering only gasoline versions of the three vehicles. 
Some former Winnebago officials, however, say problems with the diesel models led to the switch to gasoline power. 

   A Renault spokesman says the French auto maker is "just a supplier" to Winnebago, and that the motor-home maker "is in charge of its own product, including the engine." 
He says Renault hasn't had problems with the engine in Europe. 

   Unsatisfied with the response from Winnebago, angry owners have formed an informal network to take on the company. 
They leave notes on LeSharo windshields and compile lists of unhappy owners. 
And they hire lawyers. 
Fred Curran, a 67-year-old retiree from Rochester, N.Y., even formed a club of disgruntled owners, which has hired a lawyer to sue the company. 

   The diesel-powered RVs were supposed to cause a different kind of revolution. 
Still suffering from an earnings slump brought on by the gasoline shortage in the late 1970s, Winnebago designed a whole new vehicle, moving away from the traditional heavy coach built on the back of a truck body. 
It would be fuel-efficient and sell for less than $23,000. 
It would have front-wheel drive and an aerodynamic design. 

   The result, introduced in 1983, was a road-hugging, 22 miles-per-gallon marvel that helped Winnebago achieve record sales and near-record earnings that year. 
Though half the weight of a conventional motor home, the LeSharo and Phasar boasted all the conveniences: range, refrigerator, hot-water heater and a bathroom. 
The company's 1983 annual report featured a LeSharo on its cover. 
The new line helped Winnebago boost its market share by 19% in 1984. 

   Mr. Pelletier bought his $22,000 LeSharo the very next year, banking on the reputation that had made Winnebago synonymous with motor home. 
But after 36,000 miles, he says he had replaced the engine, turbocharger and transmission. 
He says he spent $14,000 on repairs before finally selling it to a dealer for $7,000. 

   The Sagamore resort on Lake George, N.Y., bought the van version in 1985. 
Within two years, it had gone through two engines, one turbocharger, two trans-axles, one transmission and three clutches. 
Total cost of those and other repairs: $18,000. 
The hotel's owner says his five Winnebagos -- four of which were diesels -- racked up a total of $50,000 in repair costs. 
The last of the Winnebagos broke down in May. 
"I might drive it into the woods and use it for storage," says Mark Graves, the hotel's director of grounds. 

   "I think the engine is way too small for the size of the vehicle," says Mr. Graves, who is responsible for maintaining the Sagamore's fleet of 35 vehicles. 
"It couldn't take the stress." 

   Some retirees sank much of their savings into the units. 
Mr. Curran says he cashed in a retirement plan to pay for the new engine for his motor home. 
In a letter to Winnebago founder and Chairman John K. Hanson, Mr. Curran said the engine failed after 25 months and 12,000 miles, even though he says he changed oil and filters every 2,000 miles, more often than the manufacturer recommended. 

   Winnebago's reply to Mr. Curran was similar to its response to other owner complaints: "We sincerely regret any inconvenience or expense you have recently encountered," the company said in a letter, but the 12-month, 12,000-mile factory warranty has run out.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal
by General Motors Corp., which was seeking to kill a
warranty-related lawsuit that may become a class action for
nearly 600,000 purchasers of 1981-1985 cars and trucks with
5.7-liter diesel engines.
   The suit was filed by 183 purchasers of diesel-powered
vehicles for alleged violations of a federal law that
regulates warranties on consumer products. The purchasers,
who experienced problems with the engines, sued over the
company's failure to repair defects and challenged GM's
limits imposed on "implied" warranties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit hasn't been certified as a class action, yet.
The purchasers say that if a federal court recognizes the
case as a class action, there may be 596,364 persons making
claims against GM.
   "We're dissapointed that the Supreme Court declined to
review the court of appeals decision," a GM spokesman said.
"The Supreme Court decision is not a decision on the merits
of the case or that it can proceed with a class action. GM
intends to vigorously defend itself in this case."
   The dispute is over the so-called implied warranty of
merchantability. Motor vehicle makers provide buyers some
express, written warranties on parts. But most states also
have laws regulating sales that add an additional, implied
promise in consumer transactions that the merchandise is fit
for consumer use.
   Manufacturers may place limits on how long express
warranties last, such as 24 months or 24,000 miles. But the
GM purchasers sued over the company's effort to impose the
same limit on the duration of implied warranties.
   Before trial, a federal court dismissed the claims of 107
purchasers who said the problems with their vehicles began
after express warranties had expired.
   But a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., reinstated
the claims, ruling that the purchasers should be allowed to
offer evidence that applying the time limits of express
warranties to implied warranties is unfair to consumers.
   The high court, without comment, refused to hear GM's
appeal. (General Motors Corp. vs. Carlson)

   In other actions, the high court:
   -- Agreed to decide whether convicted criminals who didn't
object to having federal magistrates preside over jury
selection at their trials are now entitled to new trials
because of a Supreme Court ruling last year that magistrates
don't have the power to oversee jury selection. (U.S. vs.
France)
   -- Refused to hear a challenge by PPG Industries Inc. to
federal clean-water standards imposed by the Environmental
Protection Agency. (PPG Industries Inc. vs. EPA)

<HEAD>High Court Lets Stand Decision on Car Replacement Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a decision
generally barring foreign car manufacturers from forcing franchised
U.S. dealers to buy replacement parts exclusively from them.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Mercedes-Benz
of North America Inc. that had been supported by other foreign and
domestic car makers.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
Mercedes violated antitrust restrictions on tie-in arrangements by
requiring franchised dealers to use ``genuine Mercedes-Benz parts''
when servicing customers' cars.
   The appeals court rejected Mercedes' argument that a 1936
Supreme Court ruling granted car manufacturers an exemption from
antitrust enforcement for tie-in arrangements.
   The appeals court also ordered a new trial to determine how much
money Mercedes must pay in damages to Metrix Warehouse Inc., an
independent auto parts distributor.
   A federal jury had ordered Mercedes to pay Metrix $7 million in
damages. The figure was based on $2.3 million in losses Metrix said
it suffered from 1977 through 1983, with the figure tripled under a
provision of antitrust law.
   A judge overturned the jury award on grounds some of the money
Metrix claimed it lost may have been the result of lawful
competition and not illegal tie-in arrangements.
   Mercedes, which sold some 90,000 cars in the United States in
1987, said its 1 percent share of the U.S. market depends on
guarantees of high quality.
   Requiring franchised dealers to buy parts from the manufacturer
is essential to assuring that quality, Mercedes said.
   The 4th Circuit court said many of the parts sold by Metrix were
made by the same companies that supplied Mercedes. Metrix also said
most of the parts were non-warranty, quick-turnover items such as
filters, plugs, hoses and belts.
   But Mercedes said it conducted random testing of the parts to
assure they were not defective, and Metrix did not test the
products.
   Mercedes said to maintain the goodwill of its customers it must
assure ``meticulous supervison of the products, components and
services offered by its franchised dealers.''
   The 4th Circuit court said Mercedes could offer such assurance
by less restrictive means than tie-in arrangements.
   For example, the appeals court said, Mercedes could require
dealers to tell customers the origin of replacement parts, and
could require that any parts sold by dealers meet certain
specifications.
   The appeals court also rejected a counterclaim by Mercedes that
Metrix illegally offered incentives to dealers to induce them to
purchase replacement parts from Metrix.
   Automobile Importers of America Inc., representing foreign car
manufacturers, and Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the
United States Inc., representing domestic producers, supported the
Mercedes appeal.
   The case is Mercedes-Benz vs. Metrix, 87-1560.

   General Motors Corp. must continue to defend a
nationwide suit by some owners seeking damages for defects in
diesel engines after their warranties expired, the U.S. Supreme
Court decided.
   The court refused Monday to review a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling that consumers can be protected beyond time limits
set by the manufacturer by an ``implied warranty'' that a product
is fit for its ordinary purpose.
   GM lawyers charged that the lower court's August 1989 ruling
``will have intolerable consequences for manufacturers of consumer
products throughout the United States.''
   GM and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association said the
ruling could trigger a wave of lawsuits by ``anyone who suffered
repair costs at any time,'' and could extend to all consumer
transactions.
   Lawyers for consumers said GM's arguments were exaggerated.
   The Supreme Court let stand the appeals court's ruling that GM
must defend against a suit by 600,000 owners of 1981-85 cars and
trucks with 5.7-liter diesel engines who made claims for defects
after their warranties expired.
   GM's warranties covered the engines for two years or 24,000
miles for 1981-82 models and three years or 50,000 miles for
1983-85 models.
   Lawyers for the vehicle owners charge GM knew but didn't
disclose that its diesel engines would fail prematurely.

   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accused Ford Motor Co. of violating the federal Clean Air Act by illegally refusing to fully honor emission-system warranties on cars and trucks. 

   The formal allegations, outlined in a letter sent to Ford last week, mark the first time the EPA has formally charged an auto maker with such violations, even though disputes over the warranty coverage have existed for years. 

   Under federal law, the warranties must ensure that a vehicle complies with federal emissions standards for five years and 50,000 miles. 
The law also prohibits vehicle makers from refusing to honor such warranties. 

   In the past, auto makers have often refused to extend the coverage to a defective part, such as a turbocharger or carburetor, if the part causes the emission system to fail. 

   Such refusals technically violated federal laws, but the EPA usually only reminded manufacturers about their responsibilities under the law rather than taking steps to punish them after receiving complaints from vehicle owners. 

   Now the agency said it is stepping up its enforcement after getting an unusually large number of complaints. 
The EPA said it has 23 documented cases in which it alleges Ford improperly withheld required warranty coverage. 

   "Because of the increased concern about emissions control on state and local levels, we determined that we will have a more active role in making sure these manufacturers comply with the Clean Air Act," said Richard G. Kozlowski, a field operations director for the EPA. 
"We're going to be visiting other manufacturers. 
We don't believe Ford is the only manufacturer not acting consistently with the Clean Air Act." 

   A Ford spokesman said the company received the EPA notice Friday, and plans to work closely with the agency to resolve the issue. 
However, the auto maker, in a prepared statement, called the EPA allegations "technical issues" and said it "believes that its longstanding emissions warranty coverage of emission control-related components is fair and reasonable and more than meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act. 

   "We believe, and have suggested to the EPA, that (the) issues are of importance to the industry as a whole and should be addressed through the rule-making process." 

   A Ford spokesman said the EPA action could significantly increase Ford's warranty costs if the company has to cover repairs of faulty parts that cause emissions system failures, as well as the failed emissions systems themselves. 
However, company officials say they haven't yet determined how much their costs could rise. 

   Ford will have 90 days to negotiate a settlement with the EPA or let the allegations go to trial. 
Ford may be liable for a $250,000 civil fine if the matter goes to court and Ford is found guilty of violating the Clean Air Act. 

   The EPA said the penalties against Ford may be mitigated if the auto maker changes the way it honors its emission-system warranty and if it "corrects past improper denials of warranty coverage."

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court, in a ruling that gives a boost to auto makers, upheld the government's lowering of the 1986 fuel-economy standard to 26 miles per gallon. 

   The court said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department, has considerable discretion in setting the standard. 
That could affect pending litigation that challenges the agency's lowering of the 1987 and 1988 standards. 

   Congress, as part of a 1975 energy-conservation law, set the standards at 27.5 mpg for model year 1985 and beyond, but gave the department authority to reduce the requirement to as low as 26 mpg if warranted. 

   The agency, in lowering the 1986 fuel-economy standard to 26 mpg, said Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. were making progress toward meeting the congressional goal of 27.5 mpg, but that "unforeseen events" had interfered. 
The principal one was a sharp drop in gasoline prices, which encouraged consumers to shift from small, fuel-efficient cars to larger ones that aren't as fuel-efficient. 

   Chrysler Corp.'s performance wasn't an issue because it mostly sold smaller cars that met the higher fuel standards. 

   Public Citizen, a Washington-based group affiliated with Ralph Nader, and some states and cities sued the agency on the grounds that it didn't have the authority to consider consumer-buying patterns in setting fuel-efficiency standards. 

   But the appeals court in Washington disagreed, saying Congress had given the agency broad guidelines in changing the fuel-economy standards. 
It also said the agency wasn't unreasonable in considering the possible economic impact of the higher standard on the auto makers. 

   The decision could presage future rulings on other fuel-economy litigation. 
Public Citizen and two other consumer groups have sued the agency for lowering its 1987 and 1988 model-year standards to 26 mpg. 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a business group, also sued, saying the fuel-economy standards should be even lower. 

   Cornish Hitchcock, an attorney for Public Citizen, said the group was "disappointed" by the ruling but hadn't decided what to do about the pending suit. 

   The agency's lowering of the 1986, 1987 and 1988 fuel-economy standards saved GM and Ford millions of dollars in fines for failing to meet fuel-economy standards in previous years. 
The car makers' performance is based on their fleetwide averages. 
Under the federal rule, car makers earn "credits" for exceeding the standard, and those credits can be used to wipe out fines that occur later for failing to meet the standards. 

   In Detroit, a GM spokeswoman said the No. 1 auto maker was pleased by the ruling. 
She added that the fuel-economy requirement "continues to be a straitjacket on American full-line vehicle manufacturers and the damage it causes should be removed either through repeal or amendment of the law or administrative action by the Department of Transportation." 

   At Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford, a spokesman said the company would have had to cut production of its largest and most profitable models if the agency hadn't rolled back the 1986 standard. 
"We are pleased the court once again recognized that customer demand is an important element in establishing fuel-economy standards," he added.

<HEAD>Borden Loses Battle of Plastic Lemons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled against
Borden's Inc. Thursday in a battle over the right to sell lemon
juice in squeezable containers.
   The Law Lords, Britain's highest judiciary body, upheld a
previous High Court ruling that bars Borden from selling its
plastic lemons filled with reconstituted lemon juice in Britain
because shoppers could confuse Borden's ReaLemon with a similar
British product, JIF.
   Borden issued a statement from its headquarters in New York
saying the firm disagreed with the decision but would abide by it.
   JIF's manufacturer, Reckitt and Colman, won an injunction three
years ago barring Borden from marketing ReaLemon ``in any container
so nearly resembling the Jif lemon-shaped container.''
   Borden had argued that it would be impossible to compete without
causing initial confusion because JIF was the only product of its
kind in the British market.
   The judge disagreed and said that if the Borden product were
packaged differently _ put in a box or shaped like a lemon segment
_ the problem would be solved.
   ``It's unfortunate that U.K. consumers will not be able to make
their choice in the marketplace based on price and quality of
competitive and conspicuously labeled products,'' Borden's
statement said.
   The three-year legal battle is believed to have cost the two
companies $2.5 million in legal fees.
   Lord Bridge, one of the five judges who heard the case, said
Reckitt and Colman had been given a de facto monopoly in
natural-sized plastic lemons.
   ``A trader selling plastic lemons would never be permitted to
register a lemon as his trade mark, but Reckitt and Colman have
achieved the result indirectly that a container designed to look
like a real lemon is to be treated, per se, as distinctive of their
goods,'' he said.
   Bridge said he would have liked to avoid this result, but he
could not fault the legal reasoning and agreed with the other
judges in dismissing Borden's appeal.
   Another law lord, Lord Jauncey, said he did not believe that
JIF's makers were being given a monopoly. The ruling, he said,
merely meant that Borden had not taken adequate steps to
differentiate its package from that of Reckitt and Colman so
consumers would not be deceived.
   Borden said it would continue to sell its lemon product in
bottles in Britain and throughout Europe and its lemon-shaped
containers in France and Norway.

'LEMON CAR' SUIT REAPS $80,000 AWARD

A woman won an $80,000 award from an Orange County Superior Court jury Tuesday 
under the state automobile "Lemon Law" for the trouble she suffered with her 
1987 Sterling, which she sent to the repair shop about 20 times in a vain 
effort to fix a variety of electrical glitches. 
</P>
<P>
Glenda Hauth, 47, said the headlights on the British-made, $25,000 car 
sometimes went out when she went over a bump, and the electric seat adjustment, 
radio and mirrors often failed to work. But mechanics at three dealerships 
couldn't repair most of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"One time the headlights went out and I had to drive 10 miles in the dark," 
Hauth said. "Eventually, I stopped driving the car because it wasn't safe. 
Every time I took it in, they'd say it was repaired and then about a week 
later, boom, it would hit again." 
</P>
<P>
Hauth's attorney, Lawrence Hutchens of Downey, said he believes the jury award 
is the largest ever under the law, which requires manufacturers to replace or 
repurchase a car if they cannot properly repair a defect that affects a car's 
value or safety. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Austin Rover Cars of North America, distributor of Sterling, and 
the firm's attorney, Gary Yates, could not be reached for comment on the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Estelle Duncan said she and other jurors thought the auto company "did 
not follow through; they never tried to solve her problems," Duncan said. "They 
passed the buck. . . . It was definitely a lemon." 
</P>
<P>
Hauth said she was pleased with the verdict, but would have much preferred to 
have had the car run properly from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the award was, it can't compensate for all the anguish that 
they put you through," she said. "I'm glad it's over with; I'm glad that they 
finally were shown that they can't do this to people." 
</P>
<P>
The car began having problems soon after Hauth bought it from an Anaheim 
dealership, but she repeatedly tried to have it repaired because "I loved that 
car," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hauth stopped driving the car at night at the end of 1988. ERIC BAILEY

   GM to Drop $100 Deductible It Charges
   For Repairs Under New-Car Warranty

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. reopened the auto
industry's warranty war, saying it will drop a $100
deductible it has charged for each repair visit under its
basic new-car warranty. But the new policy, which starts with
1992 models, will cover most GM vehicles for fewer miles.
   GM's new warranty plan follows the trend among Japanese
and European auto makers toward offering warranties that are
shorter in duration but cover practically all the car's parts
and promise repairs at no charge. GM found that customers
resented being charged as much as $100 every time they
brought a vehicle in for repairs under GM's two-year-old
"bumper-to-bumper" warranty that covers cars for three years
or 50,000 miles, one company official said. GM's Cadillac
division dropped the $100 deductible in 1990, and "customers
responded very favorably," GM President Lloyd E. Reuss said
in a statement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The deductible should never have been there," said
Wertheim Schroder analyst John Casesa. "The savings resulting
from the deductible are small compared to the ill will it
generated."
   GM's U.S. rivals, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Co., which
also have deductibles in most of their warranty coverages,
said they were studying GM's move. Analysts expect Ford to
match GM's move.
   During the 1980s, the Big Three sought to use their
warranty policies to gain a marketing edge. Chrysler was
particularly aggressive, offering six-year and then
seven-year or 70,000-mile coverage for its engines and
transmissions. But those so-called power train warranties
didn't cover common annoyances, such as wind noise or
defective door handles. Now, analysts say, customers are
demanding that manufacturers fix any problem with a new car.
   Under GM's current warranty, the company offered to fix
most defects within three years or 50,000 miles of purchase.
But the $100-deductible provision kicked in after the first
12 months or 12,000 miles.
   GM's new warranty will offer free repairs for three years
or 36,000 miles.
   GM's Cadillac division will keep its four-year,
50,000-mile warranty plan, under which there have been no
deductible charges.
   GM apparently hopes to convince shoppers that its new,
1992 models are of such high quality that it can afford to
fix anything that goes wrong in the first three years for
free. That's the message Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor
Co. have sent by covering practically all parts in their
models for three years or 36,000 miles and charging no
deductibles for covered repairs.
   GM dealers welcomed the change. "It's a better program
when you have something with no deductible rather than
insulting the customer with a $100 fee," said Steven
Hainline, general sales manager at Friendly Chevrolet in
Dallas. "The consumer found the deductible quite petty."
   Ford officials said they may respond to the move once they
see the details. "We will certainly review the program and
take it under consideration," a Ford spokeswoman said. On
most of its cars and all of its pickup trucks, Ford offers a
12-month, 12,000-mile basic warranty with no deductibles. The
engine and transmission are covered differently. On those
components Ford offers a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty that
carries a $50 deductible.
   Chrysler covers most of the parts on its cars for 12
months or 12,000 miles with no deductibles. The engines and
transmissions of Chrysler vehicles are covered for seven
years or 70,000 miles with a $100 deductible that kicks in
after 12 months. Chrysler officials said they aren't likely
to respond immediately to GM's new policy.
   "We don't feel the $100 deductible is that much of an
issue when you're considering the more expensive potential
costs in the engine and drive train," a Chrysler spokesman
said.

<HEAD>Quaker State Backs Up Oil With Engine Warranty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OIL CITY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker State Corp. is offering a free
warranty on the lubricated engine parts of new cars for 10 years or
250,000 miles, extending warranties offered by automakers, said
President Jack W. Corn.
   New car owners must meet strict rules to qualify, including an
oil and filter change every four months or 4,000 miles by a lube
shop or auto dealer. The Quaker State warranty does not cover
claims already covered by auto manufacturers' warranties, but it
will pay for deductibles not covered by automaker extended service
contracts.
   ``We are providing every car owner who uses Quaker State
additional protection for a quarter of a million miles or 10
years,'' Corn said Wednesday in a news release.
   The Oil City-based refiner previously offered a similar but more
limited warranty available at fewer than 1,000 auto dealers
nationwide, the company said.
   But the new warranty ``goes beyond that,'' said spokesman Benton
H. Faulkner. ``Potentially, thousands of lube shops and auto
dealers will offer it,'' he said.
   In recent years, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler
Corp. and other automakers have extended warranties on engines and
transmissions. Chrysler extended its coverage to five years or
50,000 miles and GM and Ford followed with six-year or 60,000-mile
coverage.
   Faulkner declined to reveal the cost of the warranty program. He
said only, ``Our estimate is that we can manage it.''
   He said Quaker State expects the warranty to increase sales of
motor oil.
   ``This reflects our conviction that more people are concerned
about caring for their vehicle properly,'' he said.
   The four-month, 4,000-mile oil and filter change requirement is
more strict than that recommended by auto manufacturers, Faulkner
said. But Quaker State has claimed for some time that motor oil
should be changed more often than those recommendations, he said.
   ``This puts us on the record as saying what people should do,''
he said.
   The warranty is being offered through auto dealers, service
stations and quick lube shops, Quaker State said.
   To enroll in the warranty program, car owners must sign up at
participating shops that sell Quaker State motor oil. New car
owners have six months from the date of purchase, or before the car
has 6,000 miles, to sign up.
   Quaker State said it will replace or repair lubricated engine
parts that fail or wear abnormally due to failure of its motor oil.
   To qualify for reimbursement, the company said, a new car owner
must keep records of oil changes, which must be submitted at the
time of a claim. Quaker State will pay for reasonable costs
associated with parts and labor.

   Driving with the gas gauge on empty isn't a good idea, and not
just because you may find yourself stranded.
   When too little gasoline is in the tank, condensation can form,
literally watering down the gas that's there. That can cause
starting problems, hesitation on acceleration and poor overall
performance. --_
   Keeping a maintenance record for your car can pay off.
   In addition to being a handy reference if you want to complain
to a service department about a job you think was poorly performed,
the log can be a selling tool, too.
   If you can show a potential buyer that you have taken care of
your car, there may be less concern by the purchaser of getting
stuck with unseen problems. --_
   Here are some things which may indicate a problem with your
brakes, according to Allied Aftermarket Division, which markets
Fram, Bendix and Autolite products:
   _ A spongy feeling in the pedal. This may indicate that air has
gotten into the brake fluid, making it less efficient.
   _ The pedal throbs when pressed. Throbbing can be caused by a
problem with brake drums or rotors. Drums press against rotors to
slow the car, and when the contact surfaces are uneven, throbbing
occurs.
   _ Brake fade. The driver notices that it takes longer to slow
from one speed to another when using the brakes. It often occurs
when there is frequent braking during rush hour traffic situations.
Heat is the most common reason for fading. --_
   Tough drunken driving laws are turning into good news for
limousine operators, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.
   The MVMA says about half of the revenues collected by limousine
operators come from business uses, but lots of folks are leaving
the driving at party time to someone else.
   It can be cheaper and safer for a group of friends to rent a
limousine for the night, forget about parking charges and stay away
from steering wheels after having a few too many, the organization
says. --_
   What a difference a hemisphere makes.
   There are five vehicle dealerships in Moscow, Idaho, selling
Subaru, Jeep, Toyota, Chevrolet, Volkswagen, Ford, Mercury, Buick,
Pontiac, Cadillac, Nissan and GMC Trucks.
   In Moscow, Soviet Union, there are just three. But they have
hundreds of service bays apiece. --_
   Households with more than one car in the driveway or garage
aren't as rare as some may think.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association says about 30
percent of all households in the United States have two vehicles
and about 9 percent have three or more. --_
   Motorists who run red lights in New York City may find
themselves on something like ``Candid Camera.''
   The city's police have set up automated cameras at busy
intersections in the Big Apple to photograph the license plates of
motorists who go when they should stop.
   Offenders could be fined up to $50, but no points will be
charged against their licenses. --_
   The rebates that car buyers see advertised these days aren't
anything new.
   The original Henry Ford offered rebates of $40 to $60 to each
purchaser of a Model T. But there was a catch.
   Those rebates would be available only if Ford sold more than
300,000 of the cars between August, 1914, and August, 1915. These
days, manufacturers impose no such restrictions. --_
   You can play with your toy cars at any age if you look at the
models as objets d'art.
   And a New York gallery, l'Art et l'Automobile, has a collection
to fit your artistic tastes, such as a $25,000 made-to-order
Bugatti Royale Coupe Napoleon. The gallery also stocks posters,
books, sculptures, paintings, badges and other automobilia with
more modest pricetags.
   Gallery owner Jacques Vaucher raced Formula III cars in the
United States and his native France before opening the gallery
eight years ago.

   Driver abuse is the most common reason for premature wear and
breakdowns on automobiles, according to an industry newsletter.
   The newsletter, Runzheimer Reports on Fleet Management, surveyed
117 automotive fleet managers and 62 percent of them blamed
breakdowns on the drivers themselves. Twenty percent blamed
manufacturing defects for breakdowns.
   When asked which is the most common car component to fail, 36
percent said it was the brakes, followed by body integrity (13
percent) and the engine (13 percent).

<HEAD>Court Says Consumer Laws No Protection for Those Who Lease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal consumer protection
laws don't cover leased vehicles, a Florida appeal court ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal
concluded in a unanimous opinion Tuesday that Florida's Uniform
Commercial Code and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act should
cover leased cars, but they don't.
   ``Obviously, in today's market place, a compelling case can be
made for applying the principles of the Magnuson-Moss Act to
transactions of the type before us, but that remains a matter for
legislative decision,'' the judges wrote.
   Both laws permit purchasers to return vehicles and other new
items that have numerous defects not satisfactorily repaired by
dealers and manufacturers.
   The judges said it was the first time a Florida appellate court
had ruled on the issue.
   The opinion upheld a decision by Circuit Judge A.C. Soud Jr.,
who ordered a directed verdict in favor of Frank Griffin AMC Jeep
Inc. of Jacksonville and American Credit Corp. in a suit filed by
Timothy L. Sellers and Kristi H. Sellers over a defective lease
vehicle.
   The dealer had refused to take back the Sellers' new Jeep
Cherokee or refund their down payment and lease payments after the
car allegedly developed numerous problems, including an engine that
exploded, rattles and leaks, seat covers that separated, brakes
that failed and an air conditioning system that didn't cool.
   Soud and the appeal judges found neither state nor federal law
covered the couple because the statutes apply only to sales
transactions.
   The Sellers would have wound up paying about the same as if they
had purchased the vehicle, because they would have had to carry
insurance and have the car serviced and repaired.
   ``The legal incidents of a lease vary significantly from those
of a sale, and the parties' unambiguous expression of intent to
create only a lease cannot be overturned by this court through
legal recharacterization of the transaction,'' the judges wrote.
   ``Transactions like this one obviously should be made subject to
UCC provisions for revocation of the acceptance when a defective
vehicle is delivered pursuant to either a sale or a long term
lease,'' the judges stated. ``Nevertheless we must leave this
solution to the Legislature.''

<HEAD>Air Board Orders New Anti-Pollution Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Air Resources Board on Thursday
ordered that as of 1994, new cars in California must offer advanced
computerized systems to warn drivers about faulty automobile
equipment that causes pollution.
   The new technology was approved by a 7-0 vote following a public
hearing crowded with more than 75 auto industry representatives and
environmental advocates.
   The advanced system, state officials said, would result in
quicker repairs of defective parts, leading to lower emissions of
smog-producing hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.
   Resulting reductions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would
amount to more than 100 tons a day apiece statewide, according to an
air board staff report.
   Almost half the reduction would be in the South Coast Air Basin,
which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, the area that suffers the most polluted air in the nation.
   The dashboard diagnostic system, which air board staff members
estimate could cost manufacturers $45 per vehicle, would have two
purposes: to improve air quality and to help mechanics repair
high-tech auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxious
emissions.
   Air board engineering studies chief Steve Albu said it would have
a ``greater impact on emissions than any other single control
measure adopted by the board.''
   Among those supporting the new regulation were the South Coast
Air Quality Management District, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the American Lung Association and the Automobile Club of
Southern California.
   Engineers for major auto makers said they like the idea of
expanded on-board diagnostics but raised technical questions and
requested more time to devise the detection systems.
   ``Due to the need to develop new, unproven technology,
considerable lead-time is needed,'' said Suanne K. Thomas, a staff
scientist for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the
United States.
   She said the association urged that implementation be delayed
until the 1996 model year and phase-in be extended to the 1998 model
year.
   The manufacturers' group is a Detroit-based industry group that
includes Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. The state board,
however, decided to order the changes in 1994, with full compliance
ordered by 1996.
   ``In the state of California, we have to be aggressive,'' said
Jananne Sharpless, board chairman.
   Board member John Lagarias said the dashboard system would
provide for ``smart warning lights'' as opposed to current ``idiot
lights.''
   On-board monitor lights the air board ordered on new cars
beginning in 1988 warn drivers they need repairs only when basic
emission-related parts such as the fuel system fail to work.
   The new system will require improved monitoring of the fuel
system but also monitor engine misfiring, catalytic converter
efficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air conditioning systems.
   The regulation calls for on-board computers to store data that
would help repairmen identify faulty equipment. It also calls for
standardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning tool
so any repair shop can access the data in the vehicle computer.

<TEXT>
   The companies that make motor vehicle
anti-pollution equipment predict they can meet the tough emissions
standards proposed in a clean air bill favored by environmentalists
but denounced as too extreme by the auto industry.
   Strongly disagreeing with auto industry witnesses, the
Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association told a House panel
Tuesday that its companies could produce pollution control
equipment that would meet the proposed standards for 100,000 miles
of driving each vehicle.
   Bruce Bertlesen, executive director of the group, said the
association based its assessment on continuing progress in
developing better anti-pollution equipment, more advanced engine
controls and continued reduction of lead contamination in unleaded
fuel.
   ``The most serious challenge to meeting these more stringent
emission standards is maintaining emission control performance
during the useful life of the vehicle under real world
conditions,'' the association said. ``We believe the engineering
challenges can be resolved.''
   At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee, the association strongly endorsed emission testing
programs to ensure that owners keep their vehicles properly tuned.
   Bertlesen testified at the first hearing on legislation by Rep.
Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman, to reduce air
pollution at a time that virtually every U.S. city has failed to
meet federal air quality standards. While reducing pollution from
motor vehicles is a major part of the bill, it also attempts to cut
emissions from industrial sources and consumer products.
   But the debate over auto, truck and bus emissions standards is
likely to determine whether Congress _ as happened last year _ lets
a clean air bill die in a legislative stalemate.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United
States, representing the ``Big Three'' U.S. automakers, told
Waxman's panel the best way to reduce pollution from motor vehicles
is by waiting for the normal phase-out of older cars still on the
road.
   Thomas H. Hanna, president and chief executive officer of the
association, said less than half the vehicles now in use were built
under the latest emissions standards. He blamed the older vehicles
for nearly 90 percent of the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
emissions, and more than 7 percent of the nitrogen oxides _ major
pollutants from motor vehicles.
   He predicted that a further tightening of emission requirements
would have ``a minimal air quality benefit compared to vehicle
fleet turnover.''
   Gregory Dana, vice president of the Automobile Importers of
America Inc., representing major manufacturers of foreign cars,
called Waxman's bill ``extreme and unreasonable'' and said the
legislation presents a challenge that is ``simply unattainable.''
   Waxman's bill would toughen tailpipe emission standards for
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides; set new requirements to reduce
hydrocarbon pollution from the evaporation of gasoline at the pump
and on the road; and require that emission controls last the full
useful life of an automobile.
   The tailpipe standards would kick in for passenger cars
beginning in the 1992 model year and become even tougher in the
2000 model year.
   An alternative bill, sponsored by nine House members as a
compromise between the auto industry and the environmentalists,
would toughen current standards but not nearly as much as the
Waxman bill. The nine lawmakers would use the best available
technology in requiring new emissions requirements starting in
1993, while the Waxman measure aims to force automakers to develop
new anti-pollution technology.
   Backing Waxman's position were environmental groups including
the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and
public officials representing state and county governments,
including Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin representing the National
Governors' Association.
   ``Mobile sources account for half, or more, of the air
pollutants that threaten public health in our cities, and we simply
must demand more of the motor vehicle manufacturers,'' she said.
``We need automobiles that drive us where we want to go, without
driving us to environmental destruction,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a clean air bill
Thursday that goes beyond new federal requirements for auto
emissions in limiting pollutants blamed for acid rain and the
greenhouse effect.
   The measure is based on California's tough new standards.
Supporters said Massachusetts is the first state in the nation to
go along with California's tighter controls.
   State Rep. David Cohen, who sponsored the bill, said last week's
passage of the standards in Massachusetts may encourage other
states to follow.
   ``There are many, many states that are looking at doing what we
did, but they were afraid,'' Cohen said. ``Massachusetts was a
trailblazer in this action.''
   ``We hope to create a domino effect,'' said Jenny Carter of the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
   Massachusetts air quality failed to meet federal health
standards on at least 40 days during the past three summers. ``This
law will help reverse that trend,'' Carter said.
   New York also is considering the California standards, said
Benjamin Marvin of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   The Massachusetts bill says the new standards will be phased in
beginning in 1993, but in reality state officials reached a verbal
agreement with automobile manufacturers to start the program with
the 1995 model year.
   Carter said she expects most manufacturers will adapt to the new
law by refining catalytic converters.
   She estimated that the measure would cost consumers an extra
$170 when they buy a new car, but tighter warranty standards
included in the new law would help defray that one-time cost.
   The plan calls on car makers to cut smog-causing hydrocarbon and
nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 percent to 75 percent beyond what is
required under the new federal Clean Air Act, averaged over their
entire fleet.
   Dukakis said the federal government must do more to fight
pollution and to save energy so that the United States becomes less
dependent on foreign energy supplies.
   ``There's one other way to clean the air and that's to make
automobiles more efficient,'' Dukakis said.
   An operator at General Motors Corp. in Detroit said company
officials would not be available to comment because of the
holidays, and a recorded message at Ford Motor Co. said offices
there are closed until Jan. 2.
   Dukakis also signed two other environmental bills, one to
protect endangered species and the second to make local
conservation commission members front-line agents in monitoring
wetlands protection laws.
   The endangered species bill protects the habitat of threatened
species from alteration. It also establishes a process for listing
species as endangered, threatened or of special concern and
prohibits the taking or selling of species that make the list.
   The wetlands conservation measure gives local conservation
commissioners the power to protect wetlands. In 1988, the state's
Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the conservation commission
lacked authority to enforce the wetlands protection act.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Business and the law: Flash warning - The potentially
far-reaching implications of the US Supreme Court's Kodak judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent US Supreme Court ruling against Eastman Kodak reinstating an
antitrust lawsuit filed against the photographic equipment giant in 1987 by
18 service companies, came as a rude shock to America's commercial lawyers.
Lawyers for the companies, which accused Kodak of violating federal
antitrust laws by operating an illegal 'tying-in' agreement involving sale
and repair of photocopiers, hailed it as the most important decision for US
business in a decade.
Mr Richard Fine, a Los Angeles attorney who filed a brief on behalf of the
California State Electronics Association (CSEA) in support of the
independent service providers, said the decision guaranteed survival of a
domestic service industry for all products, including cars, computers and
consumer electronics.
The decision would reduce the amount consumers pay for service and repair of
products and boost the provision of parts manufacturing. Ultimately, by
reducing US dependence on foreign made parts, the ruling would reduce
America's balance of payments deficit, he said.
Antitrust lawyers regard the decision as no less revolutionary but for
different reasons.
The Supreme Court move came as a big surprise, says Mr Roy Englert, a
partner in the Washington office of the law firm Mayer Brown &amp; Platt. This
is because the ruling delivered a sharp rebuke to the free-market, Chicago
School approach to competition issues that has dominated the Supreme Court's
handling of antitrust cases in recent years.
'The court has relied on heavier and heavier doses of economic theory in its
antitrust decisions. Most people expected the Kodak case to go the same
way,' he says.
Instead the justices said there could be no blind reliance on economic
theory. The theory must relate to the evidence of the market.
On another level, by ordering Kodak to go to trial on the 1987 lawsuit, the
Supreme Court decision has sown fresh confusion about the extent to which
antitrust cases can be disposed of by summary judgment without going to full
trial.
The US still has juries in civil cases. Corporate lawyers believe juries
invariably rule against companies accused of anti-competitive policies
because they do not understand the issues. It is in their clients' interests
therefore to dispose of antitrust cases before trial.
The case against Kodak was that by refusing to sell independent service
groups parts to fix its copiers, the photographic equipment giant was, in
effect, trying to squeeze them out of the market. Kodak's policy was to only
sell parts to owners of its copiers that had to use Kodak to service the
machines, or who performed repairs themselves.
Service companies argued that this policy amounted to an illegal 'tying-in'
arrangement. Kodak insists this was not anti-competitive because it only
controlled a quarter of the market in copier machine sales. Consequently,
its monopoly on parts and servicing was legal.
In other words companies that contracted to buy Kodak copiers knew what they
were letting themselves in for. So long as there was strong competition in
the equipment market itself, tied service agreements were not necessarily
anti-competitive.
The court rejected this argument by six to three. If Kodak had won, the
result could have been the domination of the US service industry by a few
original equipment manufacturers, a disastrous outcome for consumers, Mr
Fine says. As it is, the decision has given the service industry a new lease
of life that will lead to greater competition and drive prices down.
The importance of this cannot be underestimated, he adds. The US is no
longer a manufacturing based economy. More than 60 per cent of its gross
domestic product is service oriented. In the car industry in 1990 about
Dollars 255bn (Pounds 169bn) was spent on parts and servicing, dwarfing the
Dollars 147.8bn spent on new car sales. The high-tech equipment service
market, worth Dollars 250bn a year, is forecast to grow by more than 17 per
cent a year.
Mr Fine also believes more competition in the service sector will create a
demand for cheaper spare parts. Many manufacturers seem to be discouraging a
market in service and repair of their products by pricing parts at levels
that encourage consumers to buy new models when existing ones break down
rather than get them fixed.
Mr Fine points to a brand of Japanese television on sale in California for
Dollars 300 new; yet to replace its four most expensive parts would cost
Dollars 800. New wide-screen televisions cost about Dollars 2,500, but a
replacement picture tube costs Dollars 2,600. This pricing policy should
create the opportunity for new American parts manufacturers to spring up and
for existing ones to expand, he says.
The Kodak case is now back in San Francisco's federal district court for a
trial on the facts; Kodak shows every sign of fighting it - in spite of the
perceived wisdom that if the case goes before a jury the plaintiffs will
win.
Mr Jim Hennefer, the attorney running the case for the independent service
companies, says he is knee-deep in documents requested by Kodak, while new
evidence of abuse by Kodak arrives daily. The next preliminary hearing is
set for December 17, when the district court judge will set a trial date for
autumn 1994.
Meanwhile, Mr Fine is pursuing a Dollars 600m class action suit on behalf of
CSEA against 34 of the world's biggest consumer electronics manufacturers.
CSEA alleges that the makers fail to compensate independent service
companies properly for doing their warranty work as required by state law.
He says he is close to agreeing settlement terms with some of the companies,
but last week was forced to file fresh class action damages suits against
Sony, Sharp, Toshiba and Sansui, which have shown no signs of settling.
In spite of these actions in California, the avalanche of litigation between
manufacturers and the US's 250,000 independent service providers predicted
by Justice Scalia in the wake of the Kodak ruling, has yet to materialise.
Some lawyers say the impact of the Kodak decision may be narrower than first
thought. Kodak's policy was aggressive and its terms stringent. It may yet
turn out to be a one-off.
'The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association filed a brief in support of
Kodak. It hoped Kodak would win, because if Kodak's policy was ruled OK then
theirs definitely would be. But just because Kodak lost doesn't mean the car
manufacturers' policy on after-sale service and parts violates antitrust
law,' says Mr Englert.
There is good news for antitrust lawyers too. Last week the Supreme Court
accepted for review a predatory pricing case in the tobacco industry from
the 4th Circuit Court of Appeal in Richmond, Virginia. That will provide an
early opportunity for the justices to make it clear whether or not they have
really abandoned the Chicago School approach to competition issues.

   A divided federal appeals court reinstated an earlier ruling that requires the Environmental Protection Agency to adjust its fuel-economy estimates for vehicles. 

   The action may lead to increased federal penalties against General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. for falling short of federal gas-mileage standards. 
When the original decision was issued by a three-judge panel here in December 1986, the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, estimated that it could cost General Motors $250 million and Ford $50 million in penalties. 

   Federal law requires that auto manufacturers meet vehicle gas-mileage standards enforced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
Vehicles' gas mileage is tested according to EPA procedures. 
In June 1985, the EPA aided manufacturers by retroactively boosting its gas-mileage estimates for cars made since 1980 to allow for changes in testing procedures that depressed fuel-mileage calculations. 

   But in a suit by the Center for Auto Safety, the appeals court ruled in December 1986 that the EPA also had to take into account changes in testing procedures that increased gas-mileage estimates, not just those that depressed the calculations. 

   The original ruling was wiped off the books in February 1987, when the full 11-member appeals court voted to reconsider the case. 
At issue was whether the Center for Auto Safety should have been allowed to challenge the EPA standards in the first place. 

   Yesterday, the full court, with only 10 members voting on the case since Judge Robert Bork resigned in February, split 5-5 over whether the watchdog group's stake in the dispute was sufficient to give it standing to file the suit. 
Unable to resolve the standing question despite four separate opinions totaling 94 pages, the appeals court assumed that the consumer group was a proper party in the case. 
So, it reinstated the 1986 decision, which was written by Chief Judge Patricia Wald. 

   As has been the case on some other recent occasions, the appeals court was split along ideological lines, with five judges appointed by Democratic presidents voting to approve the watchdog group's standing and five appointed by President Reagan opposed. 

   Auto makers have long been disturbed by the fuel-economy standards. 
Yesterday, a GM spokesman said, "The (court) decision is symptomatic of the burdensome problems" created by the standards. 

   Consumer groups counter that Congress intended to force auto makers to manufacture more-fuel-efficient cars and that the standards are necessary for that goal. 

   Enforcement of the fuel-efficiency standards operates on a complex system in which auto makers are penalized for falling short of standards and gain credits for exceeding them. 
The new rule that the EPA will have to issue likely will wipe out some credits that GM and Ford were to receive based on adjustments in the testing for model years 1980 through 1984. 

   The two companies may be able to offset some of the loss, though, with credits they have gained for exceeding standards for more-recent model years. 
The more-recent standards have been lowered by federal officials.

   An alliance of government and private highway
safety advocates wants to give police the power to take away a
drunken driver's license on any road in the country.
   Claiming successes in 29 states where automatic revocation laws
are in effect, the heads of the National Transportation Safety
Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called
Wednesday for a campaign to pass similar laws in the rest of the
nation.
   The aim is to give police in every state the power to suspend
the license of a driver who refuses or fails a roadside breath test
for alcohol consumption.
   The action is taken administratively, without a court decision.
A nonjudicial hearing may be held if the driver appeals. The laws
have passed all court tests in states where they have been applied,
officials said.
   In most states, the illegal level of alcohol in the blood is
0.10 percent, but five states _ California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine
and Utah _ have set the level at a more stringent 0.08 percent.
   The surgeon general has recommended that all states adopt the
tougher law and eventually go as low as 0.04 percent for adults and
0.00 for any driver under 21.
   More than 1.6 million drivers are arrested each year on drunken
driving charges, and about half of all the 45,000 traffic
fatalities each year are alcohol-related, according to the traffic
safety agency.
   ``We hope the coalition will stay active until we get the
administrative revocation law in all 50 states,'' said NTSB
Chairman James L. Kolstad, whose independent board has called for
such laws in its investigations of drunken driving accidents.
   Kolstad and traffic safety agency Administrator Jerry R. Curry
met with representatives of safety advocacy groups, the insurance
industry, police organizations and others to plan a campaign for
passage of laws in the remaining 21 states.
   ``The fact that in the morning a driver has a license, and if he
or she is foolish and drinks at lunchtime and then fails a breath
test, the license is lost on the spot'' would be a strong incentive
against drinking and driving, Kolstad said.
   Curry said he had followed drunken drivers through the process
of losing their licenses, being taken to a hospital for verifying
tests, being processed at a police station and then having to be
driven home by someone else.
   ``It's an absolutely debilitating experience. You think you're a
criminal. You are a criminal. This is a violent crime,'' he said.
   ``Without such laws, we have to go through the court system, and
if we're not able to get a trial date, that particular drunk's
license might not be pulled for months,'' Curry said.
   The administrator said the laws may be tough to get passed in
legislatures where it has become a states' rights issue. ``It's
going to be a hard push,'' he said.
   Opponents of the laws include some police agencies who are
concerned about the extra hearings required when driver's appeal
the revocations, from trail lawyers who defend arrested drivers,
and from some state motor vehicle officials concerned about the
administrative costs.
   The federal government offers incentives of up to several
million dollars to states which pass automatic revocation laws.
   Among organizations participating in the campaign are the
American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, American
Automobile Association, American Trucking Associations, Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, International Association of Chiefs
of Police, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association and National Safety Council.
   States that do not have the automatic revocation laws are
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington.

   Paying a Premium
   For Service Contracts

   SOME AUTO DEALERS are taking car buyers for a ride by
charging inflated prices on extended warranties.
   So says the New York attorney general's office, which
gathered pricing information from four auto makers -- Ford
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Toyota
Motor Corp. -- and from New York car dealerships. The office
concluded that dealers overcharged half of New York customers
who bought service contracts in 1989, or about 175,000 car
buyers.
   The attorney general's office defined overcharging as any
prices higher than manufacturers' suggested retail prices,
which include sizable profits for dealers. Where there wasn't
a suggested price, any price more than double the dealer's
cost was considered overcharging.
   In one case, the attorney general's office says, a New
York Chrysler dealer charged a customer $1,620 for a service
contract that had a suggested retail price of $250, and a
wholesale price to the dealer of $125.
   Based on its findings in New York, the attorney general's
office estimates that consumers nationwide paid $300 million
more than they should have in 1989 for such policies. A
spokeswoman for the National Automobile Dealers Association
says, "We are aware of the findings but have no comment at
this time."
   Extended warranties may not be worth the trouble anyway.
"Service contracts can be real moneymakers for the provider
{but} very troublesome for consumers," says a spokeswoman for
Consumer Reports magazine. She suggests simply buying a car
with a track record of reliability.
                                                                                                       

   Marketing to Women
   May Be No Different
                                                                                                       

   DON'T WE all want the same thing? A woman auto executive
says yes and declares "women's marketing" to be nonsense.
   For years, auto makers have talked up marketing to women
and spent big money on several programs aimed directly at
female buyers. The reason: Women buy lots of cars and
influence purchases they don't actually make. Last year, 47%
of all cars and 20% of trucks were sold to women, says a Ford
spokesman, who adds that growing female purchasing power is
bringing women's marketing "to a high point in the industry."
   But Laurel Cutler, Chrysler's vice president, consumer
affairs, and vice chairman of New York ad agency FCB/Leber
Katz Partners, says advertising aimed solely at women is
"patronizing and condescending." Ms. Cutler says women, like
men, want their cars to deliver quality, reliability,
enjoyment and style. She says Chrysler and other auto makers
should dismantle their women's marketing committees.
   A Ford spokesman, however, says its women's advisory
committee brought the company such recommendations as car
door handles that can be opened with minimum breakage to
women's fingernails. "There is a value to a women's marketing
committee," the spokesman says. "It comes up with concrete
things that are really worthwhile."
                                                                                                       

   Things That Go Bump
   Can Be a Nightmare
                                                                                                       

   CAR BUMPERS may not be the same even on vehicles that are
alike in virtually every other way.
   Toyota's Corolla DX, made in Japan and exported to the
U.S., sustained no damage when its front bumper hit a barrier
at five miles per hour in a test by the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety. But the car's U.S.-made twin, GM's Geo
Prizm, sustained $267 of damage in the same test. "There are
some differences in {the supporting} brackets that may have
accounted for the difference in performance," a GM
spokeswoman says.
   Overall, the institute says, bumpers did "a poor job of
preventing damage, and some were downright lousy." It
recently conducted a series of four five-mph crash tests at
different angles on 16 small, four-door 1990 cars. All
sustained extensive -- and expensive -- damage in the tests.
   The best-performing bumpers of the group were on Honda
Motor Co.'s Civic DX, which had $769 in damage. The Civic's
front bumper came out unscathed in a head-on barrier
collision, and the car suffered moderate damage in three
other tests. The worst performer was Daihatsu Motor Co.'s
Charade SE, with $3,838 in damage.
   The institute blames weakened federal requirements and
failure to supply consumers with bumper performance
information. In the early 1980s, new cars had to withstand
front and rear crash tests at five mph with minimal damage to
the bumpers. But for 1983 and later models, the
Transportation Department switched to 2 1/2-mph crash tests
and allowed more substantial bumper damage. "The result is
unnecessary damage in fender-bender crashes," says Brian
O'Neill, institute president.
                                                                                                       

   Price of Replacing
   Air Bags Is Dropping
                                                                                                       

   THE COST of replacing a deployed air bag depends on the
car.
   Ford says repairs average $475 for its driver-side air
bags and $575 for passenger-side bags. But at Mercedes-Benz
of North America Inc., those costs average $950 and about
$1,500, respectively. Chrysler's average cost is $300 for a
driver-side bag; the company doesn't yet offer one on the
passenger side. Nor does General Motors, which suggests
replacing the total air-bag system, rather than just the bag,
at an average price of $945.
   The good news for drivers: Insurance companies generally
pay to replace bags. And as air bags become more common, the
cost of replacing them is falling. Ford's charges have
dropped by more than $100 in the past year.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Foreign-owned automobile plants,
leading players in Brazil's industrial development, are under
fire from a government that wants to open up the market.
   Brazil recently announced plans to allow the installation
of new automobile plants. The country's big four --
Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Fiat
S.p.A. -- suddenly have found themselves at a crossroads,
independent automobile industry analysts say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Complicating the situation is a drastic anti-inflation
program that has dried up consumers' money and forced
existing auto makers to slash production and send workers
home.
   Brazil's automobile industry, the world's 11th largest,
"will have to choose between producing better and cheaper
vehicles that can compete internationally or be squeezed out
of the market, most likely by Japanese automobile makers,"
said Amedeo Scabbia, of the Sao Paulo office of Technomic
Consultants International, a consulting firm based in
Evanston, Ill.
   The four automobile companies "have a kind of gentlemen's
agreement to not rock the boat," Mr. Scabbia said. "Since
there is no real competition among them, they don't have to
bother with developing more modern or fuel-efficient cars."
   Before taking office in March, President Fernando Collor
de Mello described Brazilian-made cars as "horse carts"
compared with those in other countries. On May 1, he ordered
a study on the feasibility of having other automobile
manufacturers operate in Latin America's largest country.
   "We have already been informally advised of the interest
of some industries, namely Japanese, to set up operations in
Brazil," said Marcos Caramuru, press spokesman for the
Economy Ministry.
   Mr. Caramaru said the entry of new automobile
manufacturers would break the cartel-like grip Volkswagen,
Ford, GM and Fiat have on the market.
   But industry leaders, such as Jacy Mendonca, president of
the National Automakers Association, say an invasion of
foreign auto makers is unlikely in the short run.
   "When we sold more than one million vehicles in 1979 no
one showed any interest in coming to Brazil," said Mr.
Mendonca, the local auto makers' main spokesman. "Why would
outsiders want to come now, when we expect to sell less than
700,000 units?"
   Mr. Mendonca said Japanese auto makers he consulted
"showed no interest in investing in Brazil. They are more
interested in the U.S., Asia, Mexico and Western and Eastern
Europe."
   Tadatsugu Tanaka, administrative director of the local
subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp., said that "although we hope
to one day produce passenger cars in Brazil, that day won't
come for quite a while."
   Since starting operations in Brazil in 1958, Toyota has
produced only jeeps and light-duty trucks here.
   Mr. Tanaka said Brazil's local market was too small to
warrant massive investments needed to set up automobile
plants similar to others around the world.
   "For the moment, the investment priorities of Toyota,
Japan are in Europe, the U.S. and Asia," Mr. Tanaka said.
   To produce cheaper and more competitive cars the
government needs to lift a ban on imports of high-tech
components, and lower taxes, which currently represent more
than 40% of the final cost of a vehicle, Mr. Mendonca said.
   Brazil exports approximately 30% of its production, but to
enter First World markets, the Brazilian vehicle must include
several high-tech components that can only be imported if the
automobile is made for export.

   Stolen-Car Trackers
   Try to Steal the Market

   HIGH-TECH homing devices that help recover stolen cars are
flocking to the market. But consumers might want to hold back
while the nascent industry dukes it out.
   LoJack Corp. of Needham, Mass., sells a system that gives
off a radio signal that can be tracked by police cars
equipped with LoJack receivers. The transmitter, hidden in
the car, is activated by remote control after the owner
reports the vehicle missing. The company, which has sold the
device in Massachusetts since 1986 and has expansion plans,
says 95% of the 1,100 LoJack-equipped stolen cars have been
recovered.
   But a competitor, Code-Alarm Inc. of Michigan, faults
LoJack. Peter Stouffer, vice president of Code-Alarm, snipes
that with LoJack, "when you get back from your trip to
Hawaii, you call." In contrast, he says, Code-Alarm's
"Intercept" system, due for launch in Michigan this month,
will flash tracking signals the moment the car alarm is
tampered with or the ignition is bypassed.
   Meanwhile, Mets Inc. of Indianapolis is launching a system
that uses receivers mounted on a series of towers to zero in
on transmitted signals. James Walker, Mets' executive vice
president, says his company's system is better because it
doesn't depend on police to act as trackers, and can be
adapted to send signals to tow trucks. In Los Angeles,
International Teletrac Systems says it will begin offering a
locator service similar to the Mets system later this year.
   The lack of a standard could thwart the effectiveness of
the systems. "You could steal a LoJack vehicle, and go past a
state police officer {whose agency monitors another system}
and nothing would happen," says Kenneth MacKenzie, a
Richardson, Texas, police detective.
   The LoJack and Mets systems start at about $600, but Mets
will also charge a $10 to $15 monthly fee. Code-Alarm's
device is part of a $1,499 alarm-cellular phone system that
also packs a monthly fee. But Code-Alarm's Mr. Stouffer says
that as technology matures and competition grows, "prices
will drop by half."
                                                                                                       

   With the Power to Sell,
   Survey Pitches a Pitch
                                                                                                       

   IF YOU'VE GOT it, flaunt it.
   J.D. Power &amp; Associates, the California market research
firm whose annual quality survey sways many a new-car buyer,
is looking to capitalize on its success. This year, for the
first time, J.D. Power is offering companies whose cars
ranked in the top 10 on its quality study the chance to buy a
customized video that dealers can show to shoppers to give
them "an independent, third-party perspective."
   Power is urging makers of top-ranked cars to buy copies of
the videos, which will cost in the area of $50 to $100, and
send them to all dealers. Power isn't publicly saying which
cars are on the list, but says the results were set before
the video marketing began.
   The videos won't say which rank each car earned. But
consumers can rest assured that the company whose car is
named No. 1 will broadcast the fact. After Power dubbed the
Buick LeSabre the top quality U.S.-made car last June, sales
of the model jumped nearly 33% that month and 91% the next.
   Power wanted to keep the study under wraps until July 3 to
give winners time to develop advertising around the results.
But the Detroit News and Free Press spilled the beans
Saturday: Toyota Motor Corp.'s Cressida was the top model;
its Lexus luxury division the No. 1 brand. Buick's LeSabre
was the only Big Three car in the top 10.
                                                                                                       

   `Affordability Index'
   Confirms Racing Prices
                                                                                                       

   DOES IT SEEM that car payments take a bigger bite out of
the monthly budget than a few years ago? David G. Sowerby, an
economist at Detroit's Manufacturers Bank, says it's no
illusion.
   Since 1972, the cost of buying and financing a new car has
gone up faster than the median family income, and Mr. Sowerby
and Manufacturers have developed an "Auto Affordability
Index" to illustrate the imbalance.
   The index is based on 1972, when the cost of the average
new car, including finance charges, was $4,464, or about 40%
of the median family income of $11,126. The Auto
Affordability Index for 1972 was 100. By 1989, the total cost
of the average new car had more than quadrupled to $19,198,
in part because of the cost of safety and pollution-control
equipment. But median income had risen only to $32,487, not
even a tripling. Result: The affordability index plummeted to
67.9.
   Car makers contend that the index doesn't recognize that
consumers are choosing higher-end cars, and getting more car
for the money than 18 years ago.
   But that argument sidesteps the fact that the car market
is stagnating, says David L. Littman, a senior economist for
Manufacturer's Bank. "There are a lot more potential buyers
out there {than in 1972}, yet the market hasn't hit any new
highs," he says. "Much of that has to be laid at the doorstep
of affordability."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   UNDER PRESSURE from New York state, Ford Motor Co. is
dropping a longstanding policy that allowed Ford and
Lincoln-Mercury dealers to refuse to provide warranty repairs
for Ford vehicles they didn't sell. As of Sept. 1, all Ford
dealers nationwide will be required to do warranty work on
any Ford vehicle. New York officials charged that some Ford
salespeople in New York were telling buyers they could get
their cars fixed at another dealership, while service
managers were refusing to take in cars purchased elsewhere. .
. . What do motorists fear the most: Brake failure, according
to a survey by the Allied-Signal Inc. unit that markets
Bendix brakes. So how many of the same car owners say brakes
should be checked regularly? Just 19.6%.

   Massachusetts Follows California's Lead
   And Adopts Tough Auto-Emission Rules

   BOSTON -- Massachusetts adopted stringent auto-emission
standards modeled after recently enacted California rules,
making it the second state to clamp down harder on
car-related smog than the new federal clean-air legislation
does.
   Environmentalists, who have criticized the new federal
emissions rules as too weak, hailed Massachusetts' move as
the beginning of a trend that eventually may force the auto
industry to meet the California standards nationwide. "We
hope to create a domino effect," said Jenny Carter, an
attorney with the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group, an offshoot of Ralph Nader's lobbying organizations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts law, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003,
requires auto makers to cut new vehicles' hydrocarbon
emissions to levels 75% lower than those set by the new
federal law. It requires emission levels of other major smog
ingredients, nitrogen oxides, to be 50% lower than required
under the new federal standards. The Massachusetts law also
copies California's provisions that require auto makers to
continually test air-pollution control systems in randomly
selected vehicles they've previously sold and to correct
failures.
   Massachusetts' adoption of the California standards
"increases the momentum dramatically" among Northeast states
to adopt similar rules, said Michael Bradley, executive
director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management, or NESCAUM, an eight-state group that coordinates
regional efforts to cut air pollution. He added that Maine
and Rhode Island "are close to proposing similar
regulations." Illinois, Texas, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington and Oregon also "have
expressed interest in" the California standards, he said.
   "At some point, it will simply be easier for car
manufacturers to make the better car for all 50 states," said
Massachusetts state Rep. David Cohen, co-sponsor of the new
law.
   The auto industry lobbied hard against the Massachusetts'
law, arguing that it will increase car sticker prices by $500
or more. "There's no free lunch," said Thomas Joyce, a Boston
attorney representing the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.
   But supporters of the new law estimate the improved
pollution-control devices it requires will add only $100 to
$300 to a new car's price. "Given the industry's unfulfilled
doomsday predictions about earlier emissions standards, its
credibility is sorely lacking" in predictions of fallout from
the new standards, said Mr. Cohen.
   Supporters of the Massachusetts law asserted that it
represents the cheapest way to meet air-pollution standards
mandated by the new federal law. To attain the pollution cuts
expected under the auto-emission standards by lowering
smokestack emissions instead is estimated to cost as much as
five times what the auto standards will cost, said NESCAUM's
Mr. Bradley.

   A few big, successful retailers believe their customers might shop for their next new car at the same places they buy soap or appliances -- and they are quietly testing the idea. 

   Some new-car dealers think the retailers -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Price Co. and Amway Corp. -- might be right, so they're not so quietly trying to quash the idea before it spreads. 

   So far the experiments have been low-key and limited. 
But that gives little comfort to car dealers. 
"The last thing we want Sam (Walton, Wal-Mart's founder and chairman) to do is to get involved in the car business," says Dennis Jungmeyer, executive vice president of the Arkansas Automobile Dealers Association. 
Warned his group's recent newsletter: "What if Sears, Penney's or K mart decided to do the same thing? 
Next thing you know, Piggly-Wiggly would be selling" four-wheel-drive trucks. 

   That may be a bit far-fetched. 
But the specter of multibillion-dollar retailers in the car-selling game to any degree has raised auto dealers' fears. 
Painfully aware of how Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., K mart Corp. and others have cut into their parts and tune-up business, few dealers dismiss the marketing power and customer base of these retailing giants. 

   The retailers rarely have any car models on display. 
And they actually can't even sell new cars themselves; only franchised dealers can obtain new cars from auto makers. 
So instead, retailers refer customers to dealers who have agreed to deliver new autos at cut-rate prices. 
The customer then completes the purchase and takes delivery from the dealer. 
In turn, retailers receive a fee from the dealers. 

   Already, Sam's Wholesale Club, with about 80 warehouse stores nationally, has experimented with car sales in a few outlets in Arkansas, Texas and Florida. 
Sam's, a Wal-Mart unit, says it dropped its program because it wasn't worthwhile. 
But the bigger problem may have been that Arkansas and Texas dealers withdrew because of legal challenges. 

   Nick White, a Wal-Mart senior vice president and general manager of the Sam's chain, doesn't rule out the program's revival. 
"We thought it would be a benefit to our customers," he says. 

   Price Clubs of California, a 37-store, $3.2-billion discount club in the West and East also offers a car-shopping plan in some stores. 
And Amway, noted for its nationwide army of in-home salespeople, has quietly added cars to its list of soaps, cleansers and household supplies. 
Amway distributors can now sell their customers memberships in a program that would allow them to buy cars through 1,500 dealers in 26 states. 
Amway hopes to expand the dealer list to about 35 states. 

   To head things off, dealers in some states are turning in competitors who strike bargains with retailers. 
The complaining dealers are taking advantage of state laws that prohibit third-party fees for helping sell new cars. 
In Texas and Arkansas, dealers offering cars through Sam's were warned any fee paid Sam's would be illegal. 
After a California dealer complained to motor vehicle officials, four San Diego dealers working with Price Clubs began paying the chain a flat "advertising" fee for displaying brochures and prices, instead of a per-car fee. 

   By some estimates, as many as half the states have such laws, and some people think they're unfair. 
"Why shouldn't you as a consumer have a free choice to buy a car from whom you want?" asks Arnold W. Wonsever, president and chief executive of Car/Puter International Corp., an auto-buying information service. 

   But dealers claim the laws, many enacted in the past decade to prevent brokers from eventually selling new cars and eroding dealers' new-car franchise, protect consumers from sellers who can't provide service or live up to warranties. 
"The auto business is a particular business where you need service along with your sales," says James T. Caplinger, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
He adds: "If we're going to have a franchise, we should be allowed the privilege of selling the cars." 

   Participating dealers like the car-sales programs. 
They save time by eliminating price dickering. 
Moreover, although near-wholesale pricing is implied, prices include a modest, standardized profit margin for the dealer. (Indeed, individual shoppers can sometimes match the prices -- if they're willing to shop and haggle enough.) 

   George Cameron, national fleet sales manager for Jim Allee Oldsmobile-Jeep-Renault in Dallas, says that a plan that generates 20 to 30 sales a month would be a success. 
"We aren't trying to knock in a home run on every single sale," he says.

   Japan's Transmissions 

   Take Technology Lead 

   THE JAPANESE EDGE in automobile-engine technology now extends to transmissions. 

   Japanese auto makers have been ahead of their Detroit rivals in developing "multivalve" engines, which have four valves per cylinder instead of the standard two, and thus boost performance without sacrificing fuel economy. 

   Now Nissan Motor Co. has developed for two cars sold only in Japan an electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission. 
The Nissan transmission is the first of its kind, and its main attributes are improved fuel economy and smoother driving. 

   None of the Big Three have anything like it in their plans through the mid-1990s. 
Chrysler Corp. came out with its first four-speed automatic transmission just last fall, and early quality glitches gave it a rocky start and sent warranty claims soaring. 

   Ford Motor Co. could adapt the four-speed automatic used on the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable to handle a fifth gear, but doing so would be expensive. 
"It isn't a hard thing to do" technically, a Ford official says. 
"It would just add costs, maybe another $50 a vehicle." 

   The trouble is, adding cost is worrisome to Detroit auto makers, who are still struggling to erase Japanese manufacturers' lower-cost advantage. 

   The Japanese have another reason to push faster on product technology: Consumers in Japan typically see cars as a recreational item and are willing to spend more for the latest advances. 
But Americans tend to use their cars for basic transporation and are more reluctant to pay for new frills. 

   Now It's Caveat Emptor 

   When Picking Car Wax 

   NOTHING IS simple anymore, not even waxing the car. 
Traditional car waxes may actually scratch the "clear-coat" finish that's applied to most new cars nowadays. 

   About 80% of the cars now on the road were covered with clear-coat finish at the factory to protect the underlying paint from fading. 
Others -- mainly older cars but some new ones as well -- have nothing protecting their enamel paints, making them vulnerable to oxidation. 

   As a result, wax makers formulated many of their products with abrasives to cut through oxidation. 
But the abrasives that helped older finishes sparkle can scratch softer clear coats. 

   "It's like taking a piece of plexiglas and rubbing it with a very fine sandpaper," says J.D. Culea, president of Northern Laboratories Inc., the maker of Kit car wax. 
"A lot of people don't realize what they're doing." 

   That's because most don't know whether their cars have clear-coat finishes. 
Not all plants have clear-coat paint shops. 
So some cars don't get a clear coat, while cars of the same model built at another plant do. 

   New waxes are available that won't mar clear-coat finishes. 
Auto makers and wax makers advise owners to find out what's on the car and what's in the wax before they start rubbing. 

   Miata Success Story 

   Has Curious Twists 

   THE SUCCESS of Mazda Motor Co.'s sporty two-seater convertible, the MX-5 Miata, is fraught with ironies. 

   One big one: The new car's assistant chief designer was Mark Jordan, the son of Charles M. Jordan, vice president of design for General Motors Corp. 

   Three years ago, GM developed a prototype car similar in concept -- though not exactly in shape -- to the Miata, which evokes images of the classic British roadsters of the 1960s. 
The GM car was called "B2B" for "back to basics," but the company chose not to put it into production. 

   Another irony: Miata fans angry at the hefty premiums dealers are exacting for the hot-selling car have some unusual company -- Mazda's own executives. 

   Auto makers have no legal right to dictate prices to dealers, as Mazda dealers are quick to point out. 
But Mazda is angry that dealers are demanding $3,000 or more above the sticker price (about $13,800) for a vehicle the company touts as "affordable." 

   Mazda is having its field sales staff "counsel" dealers that overcharging people isn't good business. 
The company sent dealers a letter conveying a similar message and plans to raise the issue at a dealer meeting this month. 

   "If we intended for this car to sell for $3,000 more, we would have charged it," says Mazda's U.S. sales and marketing chief, George McCabe. 

   Daytime Car Lights 

   May Prevent Accidents 

   DRIVING WITH lights on in the daytime may look dumb, but it's safer than driving with them off. 
That's what the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says. 
The Institute is promoting the use of "daytime running lights," which it says help reduce accidents. 

   Daytime running lights can be low-beam headlights or regular parking lights, on the front or side of the car -- any lights that are kept on during the day. 

   Two years ago, the institute outfitted 2,000 rental cars with automatic daytime lights and leased an identical fleet without them. 
The result: 7% fewer accidents in cars that kept the lights on. 

   Saab-Scania AG, the Swedish auto maker, also supports daytime light use. 
And Canada recently passed a law requiring that all vehicles sold in the country beginning in December be outfitted with automatic daytime lights. 

   But critics say daytime lights are helpful only in northern nations like Canada, where dusk lasts longer. 
One obstacle in the U.S. is a hodgepodge of state laws, including some that restrict daytime lights to police cars or cars in funeral processions.

MITSUBISHI DEALER TO FACE DMV HEARING ON FRAUD COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Motor Vehicles is seeking to revoke or suspend the 
sales license of a West Covina auto dealership because of an alleged pattern of 
consumer fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing will begin in Los Angeles on Tuesday on the allegations against West 
Covina Mitsubishi, which is owned by Ziad Alhassen. Alhassen's attorney has 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Developments in City 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen, one of the city's most successful businessmen and developers, built 
the 13-story Eastland Tower, West Covina Village shopping center and other 
smaller developments in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In DMV papers, which list 40 complaints, the dealership is accused of assessing 
illegal charges and fees to customers, of using misleading and false 
advertising, of preparing fraudulent credit applications, inducing customers to 
make purchases based on false information, and late payment of required state 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We occasionally have dealers who are charged with this much, but (the scope of 
this case) is more than we have in most incidents," said DMV spokesman William 
Gengler. "This is a serious case that we are pursuing and we do intend to take 
some action, whether that be suspension or revocation." 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen did not return telephone calls from The Times but his attorney, Steven 
P. Rice, denied the accusations. He asserted they are the result of a 1984 
dispute between Alhassen and the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen went to court to force the DMV to allow his dealership to sell 37 
foreign cars which state officials contended did not meet state air quality 
standards. Under a settlement with the DMV and the State Air Resources Board, 
Alhassen was allowed to sell the cars which were refitted to comply with 
emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no Grand Chevrolet," Rice said, referring to the Glendora car 
dealership formerly run by Eminiano (Jun) Reodica. That dealership went 
bankrupt last year amid DMV allegations of massive fraud and deceit, but has 
since reopened under a federal trustee. "This is a case of the DMV being very 
vindictive over what happened a couple of years ago," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ranked in Top 5 
</P>
<P>
The dealership was Mitsubishi's top retail dealer in the country in 1987, with 
sales of 4,304 cars, and it has often ranked in the top five, according to 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America. The dealership, which opened in 1983, nets 
the city between $300,000 and $400,000 a year in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get to be No. 1 by ripping off their customers," said Rice, who 
said there has been a "parade of DMV investigators" through the dealership's 
offices following the 1984 battle with the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
"They've come up with a pretty paltry list of accusations after three year's 
work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV began its investigation in the fall of 1987. The complaint was issued 
in December. A state administrative law judge will conduct the hearing, which 
is expected to take several days. If the hearing officer suspends or revokes 
the sales license, Alhassen can appeal to the state New Motor Vehicle Board, 
the only appellate body with jurisdiction over the DMV. Among other duties, it 
regulates car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Etching Fee 
</P>
<P>
Most of the DMV accusations stem from events in 1987 and early 1988, Gengler 
said. He said the agency may consider referring the findings from its 
investigation to the major fraud unit of the county district attorney's office 
for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main allegations involves charging a fee of $190 to $390 to etch an 
automobile's identification number on the windshield. The DMV alleges that the 
dealership falsely told customers that such a procedure was required by state 
law. It also contends that the cost of the etching was often added to the 
contract without the buyer's knowledge. In the DMV's complaint, the charge was 
listed on the contract as a "vehicle identification registration" fee. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said the DMV did not determine how many customers were allegedly misled 
in such a manner, but said "it was more than a few." He added that the vehicle 
identification number is stamped on each car by the manufacturer and there is 
no legal requirement to have the same number etched on the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the dealership never applied identification numbers to a car or 
charged for the procedure without notifying the customer. He said the 
dealership no longer offers such a service because not enough customers wanted 
it, so it was not profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The dealership is also accused of omitting required information regarding car 
specifications in newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
During two months in 1987 and two months in 1988, the dealership advertised 
vehicles without listing the make, model, type, manufacturer's identification 
number and a number assigned by the DMV as required by the state Vehicle Code, 
the complaint alleged. The omissions continued after a DMV investigator 
informed the dealership in December, 1987, that the ads must contain such 
information, according to the DMV complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the dealership does not deny that some of the identification numbers 
or numbers assigned by the DMV were omitted from the ads. But he said it is a 
common error made by car dealers because of the high volume of cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens every day in every paper," he said. "There is no bait and switch 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Another misleading ad, according to the complaint, was published in September, 
1987. In it the dealership advertised that it had 25 Mighty Max pickups and 
"150 others in stock." The DMV alleged that the dealership had only 25 pickups 
on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the dealership did have 175 pickups on hand. "We've got inventory 
records from the manufacturer," he said. "That's just one of the more blatant 
mistakes in this accusation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DMV alleges that the dealership fraudulently altered a buyer's 
credit application to Mitsubishi Acceptance Corp. so the customer could receive 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said that Tarek Alhassen, who is listed on state incorporation 
papers as the company's secretary, "told a department investigator that 
altering credit applications to qualify customers for financing was a regular 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Tarek Alhassen had a lawyer present when the statement was taken and 
he never made such a remark. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total fabrication by the DMV investigator," Rice said. "It seems hard 
to believe that our client would say something like that in the presence of a 
DMV investigator." 
</P>
<P>
Richard W. Bergmann , executive vice president of Mitsubishi Acceptance Corp., 
which finances many of the dealership's sales, said his company has never 
experienced problems or noted discrepancies in credit applications from the 
dealer. "Our relationship has been extremely satisfactory in all respects," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV has also alleged that the dealership misled a San Bernardino couple 
over how long a pickup was covered by the manufacturer's warranty. This was 
done, the DMV alleged, to induce Jeff and Theresa Auman to buy the dealership's 
service contract. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Jeff Auman said the couple bought the $550 service contract 
from the dealer and later discovered that it duplicated the warranty provided 
by Mitsubishi. Auman said that when he questioned the dealership about the 
contract, he was told that the interest rate on his loan from Mitsubishi would 
be raised or the sale invalidated if he stopped payment on the service contract 
or complained to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Alhassen's employees never misrepresented the service contract, nor 
did they ever threaten to cancel the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'd like to see their license removed," said Auman, who will 
testify at the hearing. Auman also said he was charged a fee to have the 
identification number of his car etched on the vehicle although he had never 
agreed to have that service performed.

      For Dealers, Extras
   Become More Crucial
   SOMETHING TO keep in mind next time you walk into a car dealership: Increasingly, the salesman is counting on you to shell out several thousand dollars after you pay for the car. 

   For years, dealerships have sold services in addition to the car itself. 
Extended warranties. 
Rustproofing. 
Loans. 
Insurance on loans if you can't pay. 

   But the importance of these "financing and insurance" products to dealers is escalating. 
"More money can be made here than on the actual sale of a new vehicle," says a trade publication. 
The National Automobile Dealers Association says dealers on average received 13.4% of car-sale gross profits from financing and insurance products during the first half of this year, up from about 8% in 1983. 

   "Competition is getting ever more keen in the automobile business, and profit margins continue to narrow," says James J. Madden Jr., executive vice president for operations and marketing of Chrysler Corp.'s credit arm. 
"Any additional source of income becomes more important." 

   Auto makers say that demand is strong for the extras because people are keeping cars longer, increasing concerns about their ability to pay for the car over time, and about maintenance. 

   But consumer groups complain that naive car buyers are being pressured into purchasing additional services. 
"A lot of people do their homework in buying their car, shopping around," says Peter G. Drymalski, an investigative attorney with the the Montgomery County (Md.) 
Office of Consumer Affairs. 
"But they are then totally unprepared when they go in to the F&amp;I department." 

   Some customers also complain that dealers automatically write insurance into financing contracts without saying it's optional. 

   "F&amp;I is bad when it's dealership-income driven," says Louis Carrio, assistant manager of General Motors Acceptance Corp.'s sales department. 
But, he adds, "it's good when it's customer-service driven that also produces income." 

   Is it Safe? Depends
   On Whom You Ask
   WHILE CAR BUYERS are paying more attention to safety, it's difficult to compare just how safe different cars are. 
It isn't that figures aren't available. 
It's just that they contradict each other. 

   The most commonly cited study is the federal government's crash test. 
That supposedly determines the likelihood of surviving a head-on collision, traveling 35 miles per hour into a wall. 

   But compare the results for 1988 models with the Highway Loss Data Institute's index of insurance collision claims on cars. 
Of the twelve 1988 model vehicles rated by both groups, half got contradictory ratings. 

   For example, the Chevrolet Astro Van finished 60% below the acceptable level on the federal government's test, and was one of the worst in its class of vehicle. 
But, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute figures, the Astro Van has the best record of all vehicles tested-70% better than average. 
Meanwhile, the government says the two-door Pontiac LeMans had one of the best scores among subcompacts, about 20% better than the acceptable level. 
The highway institute ranked it near the bottom, 65% worse than average. 

   "We feel we're reporting on what's happening in the real world," says Richard O. Elder, a vice president of the highway institute. 
Defenders of the government numbers say the real-world data doesn't necessarily measure the structural safety of a car -- that certain cars, such as sports cars, tend to attract unsafe drivers and therefore have higher accident rates. 

   At GM, Squeaky Wheels
   Stand to Gain
   GENERAL MOTORS Corp.'s Oldsmobile division started mailing letters in May to 383,000 owners of its 1985 model-year Cutlass Ciera, Ninety-Eight and Delta 88 cars, asking about their experiences. 
If they report significant dissatisfaction, they get some recompense, up to a $1,500 rebate on a new Olds. 

   "We're just trying to retain our owners and possibly reach a few new buyers," says Ivan W. Stebbins, Olds's assistant general sales manager. 

   But, rather than measuring current dissatisfaction, the survey may invite complaints. 
Customers who report no problems get a letter thanking them for their support, while those who scream get money. 
"I'd rather they be talking to us than somebody else," explains Charles Golden, manager for service promotion. 

   Olds expects to get up to 150,000 responses and offer as many as 8,000 rebates. 

   Auto-Repair Hot Line:
   Help or Hindrance? 

   FOR MANY, the only thing worse than having a car break down is taking it to a mechanic. 
Ron Vincent says he's giving wary consumers a weapon: an auto "tech talk" hot line. 

   Mr. Vincent -- a former Ford Motor Co. mechanic, inventor, and self-proclaimed under-hood expert -- set up his service in May in Dearborn, Mich. 
For $19.95, motorists in distress can call him, describe the car's symptoms, then get an instant prognosis on what the car needs and how much it should cost. 

   If the mechanic argues with his prescription, Mr. Vincent or a sidekick will show up to argue with you, armed with information about consumer-protection laws. 
And he says if he's wrong, he will refund your money. 

   For now, Mr. Vincent is focusing on southeast Michigan, but says he's going nationwide on Nov. 1. 

   But some say the hot line is itself a dishonest ploy. 
"How in God's name can someone diagnose something over the phone?" asks Ronald H. Weiner, president of a national automotive-repair trade group.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms Order to Revise Auto Fuel Ratings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also ran on general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's two largest automakers could face
$300 million in penalties because of ruling by a sharply divided
federal appeals court that upholds revised fuel economy ratings for
1980-1984 model cars.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington split 5-5 along
ideological lines Tuesday, leaving intact a 1986 order by a
three-judge panel of the court. The earlier order followed a
challenge of new Environmental Protection Agency standards by the
Center for Auto Safety, a consumer activist group.
   At issue is EPA's decision in 1985 to raise the fuel economy
ratings for cars made between 1980 and 1984 to reflect seven
changes in test procedures. Ford and GM contended the original
method had unfairly lowered the ratings.
   The higher ratings recalculated by EPA lowered penalties against
Ford and GM for falling short of the fuel-economy standards set
under the Environmental Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.
   Under the law, manufacturers are penalized $5 for each tenth of
a mile a model falls short of the miles-per-gallon standard. The
law also gives manufacturers credits for surpassing the standards
that can be carried over into subsequent model years.
   The three-judge panel had unanimously held that in recalculating
the ratings, EPA should also have factored in changes in several
test procedures that had benefited manufacturers by raising the
scores.
   The full court later vacated the panel's ruling and agreed to
rehear the case.
   The automobile manufacturers have never provided an estimate of
how much the 1986 ruling would cost them. But the Center for Auto
Safety estimates it could result in penalties up to $300 million
for Ford and GM. Chrysler Corp. was not affected because its cars
met the fuel-economy standards for those years.
   GM spokesman Bill Nowack said in a statement that ``the decision
is symptomatic of the burdensome problems CAFE (the fuel economy
system) has represented in recent years _ which have threatened
American productivity and jobs.'' But he added that ``the potential
impact of the court decision and the expected EPA rulemaking are
yet to be fully determined.''
   The judges split along liberal and conservative lines over
whether the center had legal standing to challenge the way the EPA
recalculated the Corporate Average Fuel Economy ratings.
   Chief Judge Patricia Wald, who wrote the original 1986 opinion,
tartly accused her conservative colleagues of ignoring legal
precedent, the will of Congress and common sense in questioning the
center's right to bring the case.
   Conservatives argued that the consumer group lacked legal
standing because it could not prove that EPA's decision inflicted
an economic harm.
   ``The fact that Congress has determined that consumers would be
injured by driving automobiles that use more rather than less fuel
is of little help in determining whether these petitioners are able
to establish ... injuries-in-fact sufficiently personal and
concrete to meet the requirements'' for legal standing, Judge James
L. Buckley wrote in a dissent. He was joined by Judges Douglas H.
Ginsburg, Stephen Williams and Kenneth Starr.
   Wald, joined by Judges Abner Mikva, Spottswood Robinson, Ruth B.
Ginsburg and Harry Edwards, said the consumers have standing
because ``the injury they suffer is a traditional economic one:
higher prices and diminished availability of the goods they seek.''

      Rustproofing: A Bad,
   But Profitable, Idea? 

   DEALERS CONTINUE to hard-sell rustproofing for cars even though many manufacturers say it's useless and perhaps even harmful. 

   The motivation for dealers is simple: big profits. 
By spraying cars with $50 worth of materials, they can slap an additional $200 or more on the price of the car. 

   "We heartily encourage buyers to get as much protection as possible for an investment as large as a car," says John Schmitz, general manager of Feld Chevrolet in St. Louis. 
"But I'm not going to deny rustproofing is a very good source of income for us." 
Other dealers say much the same. 

   But most Japanese cars now come with body-rust warranties of three to five years. 
In the last year, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have raised the warranty to six years or 100,000 miles from only three years. 
And Chrysler's warranty lasts for seven years or 100,000 miles. 
With improved body metals, especially steel that's galvanized on both sides, GM has even stopped offering rustproofing as a factory-approved "part." 

   "We don't want people, frankly, screwing around with the car and gunking things up," says GM President Robert C. Stempel. 
After-market rustproofing requires the drilling of tiny holes into a car's underbody or interior panels, he explains, so "you see wires cut because the guy drilled through something, not realizing what was on the other side." 
That concern has become critical, Mr. Stempel adds, as cars have gotten smaller and auto makers have crammed more sensitive electrical gadgets behind door panels. 

   Dealer Ratings Are
   Needed -- And Unlikely
   FINDING REVIEWS of cars and trucks on the market is simple. 
Finding ratings on dealers that sell the vehicles remains impossible. 

   The only consistent measures of dealership performance are consumer-satisfaction surveys that auto makers take to judge their franchisees' service departments, pricing strategies and sales techniques. 
Some auto executives concede ratings would benefit car shoppers, who now can judge individual dealers only by word of mouth, or by their own past experience. 
But companies aren't about to turn the surveys loose publicly. 

   "That is something we have no intention of doing," says Leonard J. Alaimo, a customer-satisfaction planning manager at Ford. 
"That would kill the spirit of partnership we have to keep with dealers." 
GM's Mr. Stempel says: "We think that's our business. . . . 
If you're a good shopper, you're going to buy at the right dealer." 

   Auto makers say the ratings indirectly benefit their customers, because the ratings are used to advise or punish poor performers and to reward consistently high scorers. 
But only within limits. 
Pulling franchises from consistently weak performers is rare because of sticky legal questions. 
GM's Buick division says it uses the ratings to reward high performers with additional franchise rights. 
But in fact, any dealer with a rating just above average can get an additional franchise. 

   Even using the ratings in this way is going too far, some dealers insist, because dealers get blamed for manufacturers' defects. 
"If you get a car that isn't all it should be," says Ron Tonkin, who owns 15 new-car franchises in the Pacific Northwest, "there's no way the customer will give the dealer good ratings no matter how perfect the service." 

   Shoulder Belts Coming
   For Rear Seats
   AUTO MAKERS, stung by recent court judgments, say that by 1990 almost every car sold in the U.S. will have rear-seat shoulder belts. 
Until then, it's catch as catch can. 

   No law requires rear-seat shoulder belts. 
But auto makers feel the heat: Last December, a federal court jury in Baltimore awarded a family $3.3 million in a suit against Ford. 
A child in the family was partially paralyzed in an accident, and the jury cited, among other things, the lack of a rear shoulder harness. 
Ford isn't planning to appeal. 

   For now, though, consumers have to scramble to get protection. 
Last September, Zillah Davis of Elroy, Wis., died after an auto accident in which she was wearing a rear-seat lap belt. 
Her surviving husband, Louis K. Davis, later wanted to get rear-seat shoulder belts added to his Jeep Cherokee. 
But Mr. Davis's dealer refused to handle installation. 

   Officials at Kayser Jeep/Eagle in Madison, Wis., say only shoulder-belt kits made by outside companies are available for the Cherokee. 
But the dealership's insurer warned that handling such non-factory safety parts could shift future liability from the auto maker to the dealer. 
"There's a real danger for us to handle after-market safety equipment like that," says John Acomb, sales manager of Kayser Jeep/Eagle. 

   Factory-made, rear-seat shoulder belt kits are available for some car and truck models, although many dealers aren't aware they exist. 
Cost: about $60 to $100, depending on the model, plus installation charge. 

   Buyers See the Future
   And Prefer the Past
   TALK ABOUT the car of the future, and most designers envision dazzling dashboard computer displays. 
But the feedback on Buick's Reatta and Riviera, two cars that feature in-dash computers and digital displays, indicates that owners haven't yet caught the fever. 

   On both cars, drivers must press points on a miniature screen to activate such functions as the radio and climate control. 

   But many dealers say buyers wish the recently launched two-seat Reatta came with the option of traditional displays on the dashboard. 
And a San Francisco car leasing agent even warns first-time drivers of the car not to use the computer controls unless the car is stopped to prevent people from being distracted.
