<HEAD>`20-20' Admits `Buckwheat' Was an Impostor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The executive producer of ABC's ``20-20''
acknowledged Saturday that the television show was duped by an
impostor claiming to be Buckwheat from the classic ``Our Gang''
comedies.
   William ``Billy'' Thomas, the actor who played Buckwheat, died
nearly a decade ago.
   On ``20-20'' Friday night, Hugh Downs narrated a segment in
which the series claimed to have found Buckwheat working as a
grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz. The impostor, Bill English, said he
had changed his last name from Thomas and refused to sign
autographs because it would interfere with his work.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Saturday that Thomas'
obituaries proved English was a fake and the show would apologize
during its next broadcast Friday.
   ``(Executive producer Victor Neufeld) feels indeed there was a
lapse in the research done by the production team and we may very
well have made a mistake,'' Ms. Perl said. ``Obviously we are upset
and dismayed with the mistake.''
   Thomas' friends and family said they were angry the impostor
received a national television audience.
   Thomas died Oct. 10, 1980, of a heart attack at age 49, said his
son, William Thomas Jr. of Covina, Calif.
   The elder Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films, starting in
1934 - when he was 3 years old - until the series ended in 1944.
   ``I just can't believe `20-20' didn't investigate this better.
I'm somewhat dumbfounded by the whole thing,'' Bill Thomas said
Saturday.
   ``We did not mean to cause any pain or unpleasantness for any of
Buckwheat's family or friends,'' Ms. Perl said. ``With regard to
the production team, obviously they will be reprimanded and that
will be handled internally.'' Thomas, who runs Buckwheat
Enterprises and makes a living licensing the character, said
impostors threaten his business. He has filed several lawsuits to
protect the name.
   George McFarland, 62, the child star who played Buckwheat's
sidekick Spanky, said he spoke Saturday with Neufeld and the
producer ``was terribly concerned about what had happened.''
McFarland, who lives in Fort Worth, said he too has been dogged by
impostors.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote the 1976 book ``Our Gang, the Life
and Times of the Little Rascals,'' with Leonard Maltin, said the
error hurt the ABC news magazine show's credibility.
   ``What kind of research is this? You would think that at this
level of investigative reporting, you would catch something like
this,'' he said from his Los Angeles home. ``It sort of undermines
anything you'll ever see on that show again. And next week, they'll
find Elvis.''
   A Tempe viewer suggested the profile, said Ms. Perl.
   ``I don't believe in the 12 years of the broadcast we have ever
had such a problem and we will without question tighten all
research and review processes,'' she said.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the dual billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   The series starred several child actors, including Robert Blake
and Jackie Cooper. The kids had a pit bull named ``Pete the Pup''
with a circle painted around one eye.
   A year to the day after Thomas died, Eddie Murphy began his
parody of an adult Buckwheat on NBC's ``Saturday Night.''

Hasn't Been Touched by Innuendo

   Like many other citizens these days, Spuds MacKenzie has grown concerned about pit bulls.

   Not that the Bud Light "Senior Party Consultant" worries about having his leg chomped off.
Rather, some people have been making, well, insinuations.

   They're suggesting that though he may wear tuxedos and appear on talk shows, when you get right down to it, Mr. MacKenzie may actually be a. . . .


   "Absolutely not!
Spuds is not a pit bull," says William Stolberg, a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Cos., which uses the dog to sell beer.
"Spuds is an original.
He's an executive."

   But amid the recent flurry of charges about the dangers of American pit bull terriers, few dogs have avoided suspicion.
Even famous canines like Nipper, the RCA Victor dog; Petie, of "Little Rascals"; and Buster Brown's dog, Tige, are being scrutinized.

   Employees and customers have been calling the dogs' masters demanding to know if the celebrity canines are really pit bulls.
The masters say the suspicions result from erroneous media portrayals.

   USA Today, for example, editorialized that pit bulls have changed since Nipper's prime (and now deserve names like Killer, Ripper and Chopper).
A New York Newsday headline read: "Petie the Pit Bull."

   "The truth of the matter is, Petie is a lovable mutt and not a vicious dog," says a spokesman for King World Productions Inc., syndicator of "Little Rascals," in which Petie began appearing in the '20s.

   A spokesman for General Electric Co., RCA's parent, says Nipper is a fox terrier, not a pit bull -- though he concedes the dog got its name "from nipping at people's heels."
Kent C. Robinson, chief executive of Buster Brown Apparel, says, "We're sure a dog as wise and loving as Tige is not a pit bull."
Besides, Tige was just a cartoon character, never a real dog.

   As for Spuds, Mr. Stolberg says that if he were a dog and not an executive, he "would prefer to be an English bull terrier (his actual breed) because they are extremely cool and mellow."
For people worried about Spuds's bloodlines, Anheuser-Busch even sends out a formal statement on the distinction between English bull terriers and pit bulls. (The company strongly denies reports that Mr. MacKenzie is pregnant; as to whether he is actually a she, Mr. Stolberg says only that Spuds "likes to keep his privacy.")

   While the name-calling may annoy the dogs' masters, others have tried to turn it to their advantage.
GE's spokesman says he has been contacted by several pit bull owners' groups seeking confirmation that Nipper is a pit bull.
"They were trying to ride on Nipper's image," he says.
"We told them they were barking up the wrong tree."

<TEXT>     Shiro, an Akita, lunged at Bybee's 3-year-old niece, shook her by the hair
and sank her teeth through the little girl's ear, which required stitches. The
same day, Shiro bit a teen-ager.;   "She had a tendency to want to play
rough," said Bybee, of Buena Park. "She had a great personality otherwise.";
Bybee said she sadly took the advice of an Akita breeder and had the dog
humanely killed after the two bites.;   "I'd never have been able to live with
it if she'd attacked another child, or an adult," Bybee said.;   Researchers
estimate there are anywhere from 1 million to 3 million dog-bite cases each
year in the United States, and attacks result in death once a month on
average.;   Obedience training or pedigree papers are no guarantee that the
family pet won't become a bite statistic. With that in mind, owners would do
well to evaluate their own pets, behaviorists said.;   Many owners do not
recognize when their dog has a problem; some simply can't believe the pet they
love is a threat to them or others, said Dr. John C. Wright, a dog-aggression
expert and professor at Mercer University in Macon, Ga.;   Behavioral clues;
"But a dog will bite the owner that feeds it," Wright said.;   In many cases,
bites can be predicted. Some tip-offs that your dog has a problem:;   The dog
won't let you hug him or her; the dog won't get off a couch you want to sit
on; the dog stares at you and tracks you through the house; the dog takes you
by the arm and tries to lead you; the dog growls if you move its food dish or
make eye contact.;   "A dog should never growl at its owner for any reason at
all," said Dr. Nicholas Dodman, director of the animal-behavior clinic at the
Tufts University Veterinary Medicine School in Massachusetts.;   One bite does
not necessarily mean a dog has a problem, experts said.;   "The friendliest
dog in the world is going to bite someone if it gets loose and is injured,"
said Orange County Animal Control Sgt. Marie Hulett-Curtner.;   For some,
problems begin early. An older puppy sold through a pet store or found at a
shelter might have spent its first few months in a cage. It might bite because
it never learned to trust people and fears new situations, Dodman said.;   A
puppy that is allowed to nip or growl without correction can grow into a
domineering dog that bites.;   A first attack occurs most often when the dog
is 10 to 12 months old.;   A pit bull can be a darling cupcake. And supposedly
sweet little dogs -- the Lhasa apso or Maltese for example -- can be vicious
biters. (Orange County's official list of vicious dogs that must be kept in a
padlocked kennel and muzzled includes a Maltese.);   'Springer rage';   Some
breeds, such as the chow chow or German shepherd, deliberately were bred to be
aggressive. Such breeds (or mixes of the breeds) might be more likely to bite
if they are not bred for a steady temperament or if they are raised poorly.
And when they bite, the larger dogs can do more damage.;   In the last three
years, behaviorists have noticed a trend nicknamed "springer rage." Several
English springer spaniels that seemed ideal family pets attacked suddenly and
afterward did not seem aware of what happened.;   The same type of attack has
been seen by cocker spaniels, German shepherds, bull terriers and Chesapeake
Bay retrievers. The cause is not yet understood, behaviorists said.;   The
cocker spaniel is the No. 1 dog in popularity, but behaviorists say they often
see the breed for biting problems.;   "If you get down in this dog's face,
it's likely to bite, especially with children," Wright said.;   Most problem
biting pets fall into two categories: defensive or dominant.;   Defensive or
fear biters are scared dogs who bite because they want to escape or get the
person away from them. They'll also bite to protect something such as a bowl
of food or a bone.;   Defensive biters develop phobias. They might fear all
men or small children.;   The fear biter lowers its head and tucks its tail.
Dogs understand the submissive language and leave them alone, but people who
approach the dogs might be bitten.;   In contrast to the fear biter, the
dominant biter wants to control its victim and is provoked if the victim tries
to move away or struggle.;   The dominant biter might try to take something
from you -- like your dinner or the chair you're sitting on. It might feel
protective toward one family member and attack others who go near that person.
It is more likely to shake its victim.;   Experts estimate that about 70
percent of biters can be reformed with the assistance of a behaviorist who has
studied dog behavior and has experienced working with problem biters.  </TEXT>

<HL> Pit Bulls: Regulate Owners, Not Dogs
---
By Diane Calkins</HL>
<DD> 08/17/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   This spring a retired surgeon was killed by two pit bulls as he walked along an Ohio sidewalk; the same day an Oklahoma toddler was savaged by the family pet.

   Two months later in Northern California, a little boy got too close to a chained pit bull guarding its owner's marijuana crop and was fatally mauled by the dog, in what emergency-room doctors called "the worst trauma case they had ever seen."

   The latest attack brings the total number of people killed by dogs this year to five -- all five by pit bulls or pit-bull mixes.

   Graphic reports of pit bulls running amok have refueled passions in a continuing debate over whether the dogs are vicious land sharks or good dogs with a bad reputation.

   Pit-bull defenders react with recitations of their dogs' ideal qualities and accuse the media of fanning the fires of public hysteria.
Those defenders, however, cannot deny statistics showing that pit bulls are definitely, and increasingly, over-represented in fatal attacks on people.
In the past 18 months, 18 people, mostly children, have been killed by "man's best friend," 12 of them by dogs identified as pit bulls.

   But these statistics alone do not tell the whole story of the much-maligned pit bull.

   For one thing, the generic term "pit bull" defies absolute definition.
Unlike most pure-bred dogs, which are easily recognizable, the four or more breeds that could be considered pit bulls come in a wide variety of shapes and colors, and range in size from 20 to over 100 pounds.
Two hundred years of selective breeding produced an agile dog with powerful jaws and the un-canine quality of gameness -- a willingness to fight to the bloody end.
But fighting pit bulls were also painstakingly bred to be docile with people.
How else could their handlers pry the combatants apart without losing arms or legs?

   Lately though, a new breed of pit-bull fancier has emerged, one which makes the old-time dogfighter look like St. Francis of Assisi.
These folks want the baddest dog on earth, and they will do anything to create such a creature.

   They steal other dogs and match them against their pit bulls in one-sided contests.
In one raid, undercover Humane Society investigators found a dead German shepherd puppy, its jaws taped shut.
Dogfighters had used the puppy for training purposes but didn't want their animal scarred.
Hideous stories abound of live animals such as kittens or rabbits being presented to pit bulls to bait the dogs and bring out the requisite blood lust.

   The pit bulls suffer too.
Abusive owners use meanness to produce mean dogs, like the San Diego man who calls his puppies to him and pelts them with rocks when they come.
At least 1,500 fighting dogs die every year, and even the toughest survive only a few fights.
The not-so-tough are often done away with on the spot by their owners.

   Among problem people, the demand for pit bulls increases dramatically after every well-publicized attack.
To meet the demand, backyard breeders mass produce puppies for profit with no regard for temperament or the very real possibility of perpetuating a genetic "loose screw."

   "The dogs involved in the latest attacks are all junkyard dogs, not kennel-club dogs," says Randall Lockwood of the Humane Society of the United States.
"Irresponsible people and dangerous dogs are a lethal combination."

   Banning the local definition of a pit bull fails to solve the basic problem -- demented people who use animals for their own cruel ends.
The first step to reaching these people is passing and enforcing strict, generic vicious-dog ordinances, like the Rhode Island law that was passed in 1985.

   Dog-club members who automatically defend pit bulls need to take some responsibility by insisting that all dogs be bred and socialized for sound temperament.
Vigorous enforcement of anti-dogfighting laws, not a high priority so far, is necessary to eliminate the fun and profit of the illegal but flourishing "sport" and the need for aggressive, psychotic pit bulls.

   Most important of all, the blame for vicious dogs must be placed where it belongs -- on people.
In the past, dogs officially deemed vicious have paid with their lives, while their owners have remained free to acquire, and create, another dangerous animal.

   That may -- and should -- change.
In Georgia, a man is serving a five-year sentence for manslaughter after his pit bulls tore apart a four-year-old boy.

   The final answer lies with the heavy hand of law enforcement.
As the Humane Society's Mr. Lockwood says: "It just might work as a deterrent to have the word spread that if you go out of your way to own a vicious dog, and it kills someone, you will go to jail."

Lady is having as much trouble as the Tramp staying out of the pound these
days.
</P>
<P>
In a transient, divorce-prone society, purebred dogs are nearly as likely to be
abandoned, neglected and mistreated as their mongrel cousins, say caretakers of
the pampered and well-to-do of the canine set.
</P>
<P>
Not only common breeds such as German shepherds and cocker spaniels, but
afghans, salukis, and even borzois, or Russian wolfhounds, can be found in the
pound with 72-hour death sentences over their heads.
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't think you'd see that kind of dog in an animal shelter," said
Nancy Phillips, who owns three dogs, two cats and a parakeet.
</P>
<P>
But Phillips and her co-workers at Seattle Purebred Dog Rescue Inc. see it all
the time. Since February, 1987, the nonprofit organization has been placing
unwanted and abandoned purebreds with new owners in California, Washington,
Oregon, Idaho and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
It's the second such adoption referral agency in the nation. The first is the
Purebred Dog Rescue of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Both were founded by Dixie Tenny Lehmann, who moved from St. Louis to Seattle
in 1985. Lehmann set up the original dog rescue program in 1984 after a friend
who helped place abandoned bull terriers told her that he regularly came across
valuable dogs of all breeds in shelters.
</P>
<P>
"I thought, let's set up some kind of clearinghouse for all breeds," said
Lehmann, who handles Welsh terriers and a half-dozen other terrier breeds for
the dog rescue agency.
</P>
<P>
The common reason dogs are given up is that the owner has no time for the pet.
Others often cite a divorce or a move, Lehmann said.
</P>
<P>
At the five Seattle-area shelters, between 25,000 and 30,000 dogs, or between
70% and 85% of all dogs received, were euthanized last year, the Progressive
Animal Welfare Society said.
</P>
<P>
About 20% of them were purebreds, said Scott Henry, shelter supervisor of the
society.
</P>
<P>
The dog rescue agency tries to hook up animals from shelters or that still are
in their owner's homes with people who call the organization looking for a
particular breed.
</P>
<P>
In its first year, the agency placed 334 dogs from 71 breeds into new homes. In
1988, they found new homes for more than 700 dogs, or up to a third of the dogs
they listed, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
A dog adopted through the rescue agency usually costs about $40 to $70, far
less than the price of many purebred puppies.
</P>
<P>
Rescue agency officials said they recognize there also is a need to place
mongrel dogs in loving homes, but say there is a specialized need for their
service.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Fate Of Bucky, A `Super Pit Bull Dog'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some say Bucky is mutt, others say it's a
``super pit bull.'' A judge's decision on the matter ultimately
could cost the dog its life under the state's new anti-vicious-dog
law.
   Lucas County Dog Warden Thomas Skeldon said Wednesday that Bucky
apparently is a ``super pit bull'' _ part pit bull, part Rhodesian
ridgeback _ making it extremely dangerous.
   A Rhodesian ridgeback is known as an African lion hound because
of its ability to hunt lions, Skeldon said. Bucky, he said, has the
aggressiveness of a ridgeback and the tenacity of a pit bull.
   Skeldon said mixed breeding is on the rise because some people
see it as a way of circumventing Ohio's new vicious-dog law, which
was passed in 1987 after a Dayton-area doctor was fatally attacked
by two pit bulls. The law singles out only pit bulls.
   ``We can foresee larger pit bulls coming into the pound, and pit
bull crosses with larger breeds. We've never seen one this large
before,'' Skeldon said about Bucky, who weighs about 90 pounds.
   ``We hear there's an attempt to cross pit bulls with breeds so
that it doesn't look like a pit bull, and there also is the tendency
to breed the dog with a larger animal. This is frightening,'' he
said.
   County deputy dog wardens on Dec. 15 confiscated Bucky, who is
licensed, after the dog was seen running loose from its yard, which
had an open gate.
   Ron Cannon, a deputy dog warden, said the pound was notified by
the U.S. Postal Service, which complained that the dog chased one a
letter carrier, who had to use a spray deterrent to keep the dog at
bay.
   The owner, Amy Adkins, was cited for having a vicious dog
improperly confined and for having no liability insurance.
   Her attorney, Christopher Park, disputes Skeldon's contentions
that Bucky is a pit bull.
   ``It is my understanding that it is not a pit bull. I know the
owners say it isn't,'' he said.
   He said talking about the case would be premature because of a
Jan. 12 pretrial conference in Municipal Court.
   If a judge determines the dog is a pit bull, he can order it
destroyed.
   The previous attack classifies Bucky as a dangerous dog under the
law, but the question remains whether he is a pit bull, the only
breed listed in the state statue as a vicious dog.
   Penalities for violations involving dangerous dogs and vicious
dogs are similar, but the law requires the owner of a vicious dog to
carry proof of liability insurance, which is often difficult to
obtain.
   Skeldon said he thinks the dog is a threat to the public.
   ``I am willing to euthanize the dog if that's the case. But if I
am told by the court to return the dog to its owners, I will comply
with that also,'' he said.

<P>
Fatal maulings by pit bulls have occurred often enough in recent years to seem
almost commonplace. Equally common and predictable are the reactions of
everyone concerned.
</P>
<P>
Politicians, such as Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and Gov. George
Deukmejian, talk of an outright ban on pit bulls, and the dog lobby reacts with
an immediate campaign against such legislation.
</P>
<P>
The news media slavishly recount the gruesome details of the latest attack, and
the public clamors for something, anything, to prevent such atrocities.
</P>
<P>
I am a reserve animal-control officer, a dog owner and a writer about dogs
(including pit bulls), and this latest killing leaves me with an eerie sense of
deja vu.
</P>
<P>
Marjee Lilly, a 70-year-old San Diego woman visiting her grandson's home in Los
Angeles, was killed by his two dogs, young pit bull mixes. We'll probably never
know why Vic and Chomper attacked her.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Marjee Lilly's death calls for solutions beyond the usual lip
service to good laws and platitudes about responsible pet ownership.
</P>
<P>
First, though, we need a common understanding of the nature of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The term "pit bull" has been used to identify a large population of registered
and unregistered, purebred and mixed-breed dogs. Their ancestors were bred and
raised to fight other animals. As such, most share a remarkably uncanine
characteristic: They will fight to the bloody end and rarely warn of an
impending attack.
</P>
<P>
Just because they are genetically selected to fight other animals does not mean
they present a danger to people. On the contrary, the old-time dogfighters bred
their animals to be docile with humans.
</P>
<P>
Those dogfighters may not be everyone's idea of the perfect gentlemen -- except
when compared to the owners who emerged in the 1980s: the street-corner
fighters, the drug dealers and the macho guys who want the meanest dog on the
block. Backyard breeders, looking to make a quick buck, started mass-producing
the dogs with no regard to temperament.
</P>
<P>
No one can dispute the fact that pit bulls are over-represented in fatal
attacks. From 1979 through 1988, at least 157 people were killed by dogs in the
United States, and pit-bull breeds were involved in 41.6% of those fatal
attacks, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.
Although there are no reliable statistics on the number of pit bulls, we know
that those breeds do not account for anywhere near 40% of our canine
population.
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, the pit bull is just the latest breed to reap the spoils of
over-popularity. In the 1960s and 1970s, guard and attack dogs became popular,
and the wrong people wanted Doberman pinschers and German shepherds. Soon,
German shepherds headed the list of dogs that killed. In this decade, there's a
strong likelihood the Rottweiler will replace the pit bull as the media's dog
from hell.
</P>
<P>
One of the obvious solutions is to pass laws, but not those outlawing a new
dangerous dog each decade. Both San Diego and Los Angeles recently passed model
laws. In those cities, a dog can be impounded by animal control officers if it
attacks or even shows a propensity to cause injury to humans (and in Los
Angeles, other animals.) Enforcing the laws against dogfighting also helps.
</P>
<P>
But laws and enforcement can do only so much. Dog owners must be held liable
for the actions of their canine charges. In that regard, we have made strides.
At least two people, including a California man, have been convicted of
manslaughter after their pit bulls killed.
</P>
<P>
But why stop there? Why not hold dog sellers, including pet stores, responsible
as well?
</P>
<P>
Dog-fanciers in other countries are ahead of Americans in recognizing the
importance of canine temperament. For instance, in Mexico, a German shepherd
must have proof of a sound temperament in order to have its championship
recognized. Tests of temperament are available and are already used by
law-enforcement agencies and other specialty trainers.
</P>
<P>
Strong steps should at least be thoughtfully studied before we forget Marjee
Lilly:
</P>
<P>
* Demand that all breeding dogs have proof of sound temperament as well as
proof that they are free of the ever-growing numbers of genetic defects showing
up in purebred dogs. Concurrently, set up free clinics to encourage spaying and
neutering of companion pets.
</P>
<P>
* License dog breeders. Anyone wanting to produce puppies would have to prove
knowledge of canine behavior, genetics and the importance of socializing young
animals.
</P>
<P>
* Establish minimum standards to help consumers identify first-class,
well-socialized puppies, whose parents are sound in health and temperament.
</P>
<P>
Well-bred, well-socialized dogs do not kill. We must take strong, creative
action to avoid future pit bull (or Doberman or Rottweiler) incidents.

<HEAD>Dogs Quarantined After Fatal Attack on Elderly Woman</HEAD>

   Authorities on Monday quarantined
three mixed-breed dogs that attacked and killed a 73-year-old woman
as she picked up a newspaper in her front yard.
   A neighbor used a baseball bat to run off the dogs, but Frances
Fletcher died shortly after the attack Sunday.
   The state attorney's office Monday was considering criminal
charges against Sidney Bodie and Scherrie Laramore, neighbors who
owned the dogs, Jacksonville sheriff's spokesman Asa Higgs said.
   The three dogs _ one of them pregnant _ were held in the county
pound.
   ``We're holding them until we get word from the state,'' said
John Hartley, animal control supervisor. ``Under normal
circumstances, they would be held in quarantine for 10 days to
determine if they had rabies, then released to their owners.''
   The county would hold on to the dogs if charges were filed
against their owners, Hartley said.
   County officials initially identified the animals as English
bulldogs _ a small, pug-nosed breed _ arousing the ire of owners
and breeders of the dogs, who contend they are not as aggressive as
pit bulls.
   Hartley said Monday that animal control officials were not sure
of the breed.
   ``We're saying they're mixed bulldogs,'' Hartley said. ``It
could be English and pit. They've got a little bit of everything.''
   Other experts disputed the identification.
   ``It was told to me that they were English bulldogs, but they
were definitely not,'' said Phil Snyder, executive director of the
Jacksonville Humane Society. ``They look like pit bull terriers, or
mixed-breed pit bulls.''

<HEAD>Pit Bulls the Subject of New Legal Dogfight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gruesome death of an elderly woman after
an attack by two pit bull terriers has revived a legal dogfight
between pet owners and authorities over the regulation of vicious
canines.
   The issue centers on whether cities should pass ordinances
specifically citing pit bulls _ a breed the American Kennel Club
says does not exist among its 141 registered varieties.
   Animal control officers and politicians have adopted an
I-know-one-when-I-see-one stance, and insist the dogs that fit the
general pit bull description are more vicious than others and need
to be regulated more closely.
   Both sides have had victories. Last year, the kennel club
successfully challenged a New York City law requiring that pit
bulls be neutered, tattooed with a registration number, and
leashed, muzzled or confined at all times.
   But an Overland Park, Kan., law requiring the dogs to wear
muzzles when out of their homes or kennels survived a lawsuit by
pit bull owners that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined
to review the case.
   In Florida's Dade County, pit bull owners must pay a $50
registration and keep the dogs indoors or locked in a cage or a
6-foot-high pen. Outside, the dogs must be leashed and muzzled.
   After an attack in the Happy Valley, Ore., pit bull owners
managed to block an ordinance that would have had the animals and
other vicious dogs put to death or removed from the Portland-area
city.
   In California, a law took effect in January establishing a
uniform system of review, hearing and punishment for owners of
vicious dogs. But the law also bans counties and cities from
enacting their own regulations ``if they are specific to breed.''
   Focusing on any one breed ``is cutesy, shortcut politics'' aimed
at getting maximum attention, said Alan J. Stern, American Kennel
Club vice president.
   ``You make a dog vicious. You beat it, deny it affection, apply
electric shock, put down its food dish and take it away,'' said
Stern. ``These dogs are bad because of bad people.''
   He said 21 states and 183 cities have bans that do not mention
specific breeds.
   But Los Angeles Animal Control Lt. Michael Burns, who is
overseeing the investigation of the dog-mauling death of
70-year-old Marjee Lilly, said there are enough specifics about pit
bulls to adopt a law regulating them.
   ``This is the year of the pit bull ban,'' he said.
   He said arguments by opponents of pit bull bans about the
absence of genetic differences between breeds fall down in the
reality of backyard breeding used to produce dogs that most people
accept as pit bulls.
   ``You have a dog that has aggressive tendencies enhanced through
constant and incestuous breeding,'' Burns said. ``If there are some
recessive genes on the aggressive or psychotic side, they will make
themselves manifest.''
   Mrs. Lilly, of San Diego, was visiting her grandson at his home
and was attacked by his two dogs when she tried to feed them.
   The 4-foot-11 inch, 130-pound woman was alone at the time and
was mauled by the dogs for a half hour. She died Jan. 17, one day
after the attack.
   Her death prompted Gov. George Deukmejian to say he would
consider legislation restricting the ownership of pit bulls. Such
legislation would override the current law he signed.
   But Stern said the dogs that attacked Mrs. Lilly were
mixed-breed boxers. He called the immediate identification as pit
bulls typical of the trend by police, animal control officers and
the media to write off all vicious dogs as pit bulls.
   ``Pit bulls have been identified at one time or another as 27
different breeds,'' he said. ``It's a handle. If there's a dog
attack, then it's a pit bull.''
   Pit bull is generally applied to Staffordshire bull terriers,
the American Staffordshire terrier, the American pit bull terrier
and sometimes the bull terrier.
   Bred for dog fighting, they have a powerful chest, neck and jaw
muscles.
   And those are the features that backyard buyers of pit bulls are
most interested in, said Burns. He said a dog generically called a
pit bull can be bought for around $15 to $30 in Los Angeles.
   ``It just has to have the characteristics you talk about when
you are describing a fighting dog,'' he said.
   And they are different, Burns insisted.
   ``There's an absence of the normal sounds a dog makes when it
attacks,'' said Burns, who trained sentry dogs for the military.
``It's almost a workmanlike way they hold on in an attack. It's a
persistence I haven't seen in any other breed.''

<HL> Efforts to Ban Pit Bulls Spark Arguments
Over Residents' Safety and Civil Liberties
---
By Tony Cantu
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 07/06/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   In the past four years, 28 Americans have been murdered by dogs.
In 20 cases, the attackers were pit bulls.

   Viewed by many as instinctive killers but by others as playful pets, pit bulls have touched off emotional arguments over community safety and civil liberties.
As more municipalities ban the breed, debate intensifies over whether pit bulls' nature -- or irresponsible owners -- are to blame for the dogs' behavior.

   Either way, increasing accounts of grisly attacks have made the nation's one million pit bulls among the most feared animals in the U.S.
While accounting for just 2% of the dog population, they have caused five times more deaths than sharks have since 1983.

   "The best analogy is like keeping a loaded gun around," says Randall Lockwood, director of higher education programs of the Humane Society of the United States.

   This year, pit bulls are killing at the rate of once a month -- and, as always, children and the elderly are the most frequent targets.
In April, 16-month-old Melissa Larabee of Jones, Okla., was killed by a pit bull on a chain.
In May, two pit bulls killed a 67-year-old man in Dayton, Ohio, as arriving medical technicians, too terrified to emerge from their vehicles, attempted in vain to run over the dogs.

   Ten days later, a pit bull killed two-year-old James Soto in Morgan Hill, Calif.
"After 18 years as a policeman, I've never seen anything that bad," said Lt. Curtis Cole, who was at the scene of the boy's death.

   Some animals are as vulnerable as people.
In March, two pit bulls picked a fight with a woman's pet cougar in Orlando, Fla.
And in May, three pit bulls dug under a fence at the Houston zoo and killed six wallabies, a kangaroo and a goat.

   The pit bull was bred in 19th-century England for bull-baiting, in which three or four of the dogs were put in a ring to torment a bull.
When outlawed in 1835, this pastime gave way to dog fighting, in which the pit bull proved to be a ferocious competitor.
Today, pit bull is a generic term that applies to the American pit bull terrier, the American Staffordshire terrier and such mixed breeds as the Staffordshire bull terrier and the venerable bulldog.

   It has the build of a fighter: stout and strong-boned, with two-inch-thick muscles on its lower jaws.
Three .22-caliber bullets fired at an attacking pit bull in Arlington, Texas, last year ricocheted off the animal's skull.
The dog's method of biting is more destructive than that of a German shepherd or Doberman pinscher.
"They bite, hold and tear, as opposed to just biting and holding," says Andrew Rowan, director of the center for animals at the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine in Grafton, Mass.

   Many people, however, claim that irresponsible owners -- not the dogs themselves -- are to blame for the high incidence of attacks.
"They're amoral," says an official of the United Kennel Club, a prestigious pedigree association.
"They'll do what the trainer allows them to do."

   Indeed, in responsible families, pit bulls can make good pets.
Their playful side is aroused as easily as any breed's.
They shed little and are easily groomed.
And it goes without saying that pit bulls make good watch dogs; family fears of crime help account for the increasing popularity of the breed.

   "They're neat," says Sarah Nugent of Houston, whose four pit bulls guard the house and sometimes play with neighborhood children.
As she prepares to release her dog Lucky from his cage, 10-year-old James Kinsen is holding a bone, and 70-pound Lucky lunges -- only to begin wrestling playfully with the child.
"That's real vicious," Ms. Nugent says sarcastically.

   Many experts, too, say it is unfair to condemn an entire breed because of a few violent animals.
"It's tantamount to saying that only people of a (particular) ethnic background are criminals," says Roy Carlberg, executive secretary of the American Kennel Club.
Some pit bulls are perfectly stable, he says, while others can't control their violent temperament and superior strength.

   Unfortunately, pit bulls do seem to attract their share of unsavory masters, who seek out and encourage such temperaments.
Many owners are aficionados of dog-fighting, a bloody practice outlawed in 36 states.
In January a thief used a pit bull as a weapon while robbing a fast-food restaurant in Chicago.
In Kalamazoo, Mich., a woman was charged with assault after allegedly ordering her pit bull to attack two policemen.
Some law-enforcement authorities say the pit bull has become the watchdog of choice among drug dealers.

   Unwilling to rely on the discretion of owners, several municipalities have banned pit bulls outright.
When Cincinnati imposed jail terms of 60 days and fines of $1,000 last year for ownership of pit bulls, the animal-control center there began receiving and destroying an average of 12 pit bulls a month.
Similar statutes have been adopted by Tijeras, N.M.; Lynn, Mass.; Liberty, Mo.; and Shawnee, Kan.

   Such ordinances are often passed amid community outrage over a well-publicized attack, such as the one on the Soto boy in Morgan Hill.
After the attack, the City Council immediately began discussing a law.
"Those dogs are unpredictable and should be banned," says Arthur Soto, the boy's father.

   But such efforts have been opposed in court by the dogs' many devotees.
A lawyer successfully attacked a ban on pit bulls in Broward County, Fla., by arguing that the ordinance was too vague and, thus, violated the owners' Constitutional right to due process.
Many communities sidestep that issue by passing so-called vicious-dog laws, which require that all animals be kept on a leash in a secure area rather than targeting individual breeds.

   In a few cases, individual owners are being held accountable for their dogs' actions.
Michael Patrick Berry, whose pit bull killed Mr. Soto's child last month, was charged with involuntary manslaughter.
Mr. Berry has blamed the child's parents for allowing the child to wander too close to the dog.
The case is pending.
In Decatur, Ga., Hayward Turnipseed was sentenced in February to five years in prison for involuntary manslaughter after his three pit bulls killed a four-year-old boy.
Mr. Turnipseed is appealing.

   Investigating a dog's family history may be one way for would-be owners to avoid problems.
"Temperament is 70% hereditary," says Janice Price, an official at the American Kennel Club.
"If you want to get a pit bull, make sure you meet the father and the grandfather if you can."
But she adds that even the best animals may have a checkered lineage.
"If you shake the family tree hard enough," she says, "you're going to have some biting dogs."

   The owner of two part-pit bull dogs that
fatally injured his elderly grandmother in a half-hour attack wants
the dogs destroyed, but authorities said Wednesday the animals'
deaths must await an investigation.
   Marjee Lilly, 70, died Wednesday at County-USC Medical Center
despite six hours of surgery that included the amputation of her
left arm.
   ``She had puncture wounds on most of her torso and all the flesh
had been eaten off both arms from the wrist to the shoulder,''
police Lt. Alan Kerstein said Tuesdsay. The dogs gnawed on the
woman for about 30 minutes.
   The San Diego woman had been visiting her grandson, Clarence
Hubbard, when the dogs attacked Tuesday.
   Mrs. Lilly, who remained conscious during the mauling, told
police the dogs attacked while she was trying to feed the 45- to
50-pound animals.
   Hubbard, 34, who found his 4-foot-11, 130-pound grandmother on
the floor, said he's owned the 14-month-old pit bull terrier-boxer
mixed breed dogs since they were puppies and they had never
attacked anyone before.
   Hubbard told police he wanted the dogs destroyed, but city
Department of Animal Control Lt. Michael Burns said the dogs would
remain in quarantine at the North Central Animal Care and Control
Center.
   ``Our investigation is far from being complete,'' Burns said.
``We are going to hold the dogs for two reasons: First, we don't
know if they have bitten anyone else so we are holding them on a
10-day rabies quarantine, and second, we have to see if there is
any kind of negligence.''
   Kerstein said there apparently was no criminal violation because
the dogs were on private property.
   Gov. George Deukmejian said during a morning news conference on
another subject that he would be willing to consider legislation
restricting ownership of pit bull terriers.
   ``I'm as disturbed and distressed as anybody,'' the governor
said. ``We have to have some kind of law against owning them or
some other way of completely controlling them.''
   Burns said he would never own a pit bull terrier or recommend
one for a pet because of their unpredictable, vicious nature.
   ``They have a greater propensity for harming, for injuring an
individual. They will continue to attack where another dog will
just bite and run away,'' Burns said.
   ``A pit bull has a propensity for viciousness but some people
like breeds for a vicarious experience. They identify with tough,
big, aggressive dogs,'' he added
   Because there are more of them, German shepherds are the
nation's No. 1 biting dog. ``But per capita, you will have greater
injuries with pit bulls,'' Burns said.

<HEAD>Judge Bars City from Enforcing Pit Bull Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge barred the city from enforcing its strict
regulations of pit bull dogs, including a ban on all new pit bulls
after Oct. 1.
   In a ruling released Friday, State Supreme Court Justice Leland
DeGrasse called the Board of Health regulations irrational and
vague, saying the agency had not shown pit bull terriers were more
dangerous than other breeds.
   ``Vicious dog laws are already in place and can be enforced,'' he
said.
   City Council member Carolyn Maloney called DeGrasse's ruling ``a
resounding victory for dog owners and citizens concerned with sane
dog safety laws.'' She had opposed the regulations and submitted her
own legislation.
   The board, which enacted rules at Mayor Edward I. Koch's request,
called the pit bull ``a unique public health problem'' and cited the
dog's ``unusual savagery.''
   The American Kennel Club sued to challenge the rules, which
required the dogs to be neutered, tatooed with a registration number
and leashed and muzzled or confined at all times.
   The city argued that while pit bulls were 2 percent of the city's
dog population, they inflicted 14 percent of the bites over a
10-month period beginning November 1987.
   The name pit bull is used for several breeds, including the
Staffordshire bull terrier, the American Staffordshire terrier, the
American pit bull terrier and sometimes the bull terrier. Bred over
the centuries for dog fighting, they have powerful chest, neck and
jaw muscles.

   Dogs cause more deaths and injuries in the United
States than most people believe, claiming 18 to 20 lives a year and
scarring hundreds of thousands of people, federal researchers say in
a study.
   Seventy percent of deaths occur among children less than 10 years
old, including many less than a year old, who are sometimes attacked
while sleeping or after wandering into fenced areas where dogs are
kept, the study found.
   ``The occurrence of dog bite-related fatalities has been
underestimated,'' the authors, from the national Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, said in their report in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``Many of these bites and deaths are potentially preventable,''
they added.
   Pit bull breeds were involved in 42 of the 101 deaths in which
dog breed was reported, almost three times more than German
shepherds, the next most commonly reported breed, the researchers
said.
   That finding was questioned by American Kennel Club Vice
President Alan J. Stern, who said information on breeds was not
meaningful. ``We have legendary cases of misidentification of
breeds,'' he said.
   Twenty-seven breeds have been variously labeled as ``bull''
types, many erroneously, including Dalmatian mixes and Chesapeake
Bay retrievers, Stern said in a telephone interview Thursday from
New York.
   ``People don't know what they are,'' he said. ``The dogs attack,
so they're pit bulls.''
   But Ann Joly, a research assistant with the Washington-based
Humane Society of the United States, said pit bulls do represent a
disproportionately high number of animals involved in dog-bite
fatalities.
   She said, however, that news accounts of pit bull attacks
``helped fuel the fire'' by prompting ``weird kinds of people who
want a mean dog'' to look for pit bulls to train into vicious
animals.
   To curb the dog-bite problem, the CDC researchers recommended
stronger animal-control laws, better public education on dog bites
and more responsible dog ownership.
   Joly and Stern agreed with the recommendations. Stern stressed
the need for animal-control laws that ``go after the deed, not the
breed.''
   Besides deaths, dog bites cause a ``tremendous injury problem,''
said the researchers, Dr. Jeffrey J. Sacks, Dr. Richard W. Sattin
and Sandra E. Bonzo. ``More than 2 million persons are bitten yearly
_ half are left scarred, one-tenth require sutures (stitches) and
one-third suffer lost school or work time,'' the researchers added,
citing previous research.
   The authors identified 157 dog bite-related fatalities that
occurred in the United States from 1979 through 1988, based on data
from the National Center for Health Statistics and a computer search
of news stories during the period.
   In addition, there were four dog bite-related deaths recorded by
the Humane Society, and 17 other deaths at least partly attributed
to dog bites by data from the health statistics center, they said.
Since center statistics were missing for two years, the researchers
estimated that 26 deaths were unaccounted for, judging by data from
previous years.
   Taken together, the total for the period was 204 deaths, or about
20 a year, the authors said. Only one rabid-dog-bite fatality turned
up, and it was not included in calculations, the researchers said.
   ``The main victims of fatal dog bites were the very young and
very old, those least able to protect themselves,'' the researchers
said.
   The death rate for newborns, less than a month old, was 370 times
higher than that for adults ages 30 to 49, they said, and the rate
for infants, less than a year old, was 85 times higher than for
adults in that group.
   For people 70 or over, the rate was almost 11 times higher than
for the 30-to-49 group.
   The three states with the largest number of fatal attacks were
Texas, with 17; California, with 16; and Ohio, with 10. Western
states in general had higher death rates, said the researchers, who
offered no explanation for the finding.

   LONDON -- Chief Inspector Jan Eachus stares past thick
bars at the suspect he dragged in the previous night, after a
fierce street fight. The suspect, known only as Bella, glares
back through smoldering black eyes. Bella doesn't have a rap
sheet, but Mr. Eachus knows this isn't her first offense.
"Just look at those scars," he says, pointing at raw marks
across Bella's powerful shoulders. "No question this one's
been in a scrap before."
   Mr. Eachus will tell this to the judge as evidence that
Bella, an American pit bull terrier, shouldn't have been
allowed to roam uncontrolled. Bella's handler could be fined
more than $3,000 or imprisoned for up to six months. Bella,
who ripped open a dachshund's throat and bit its owner's
hand, will pay the ultimate price. "See ya in doggy heaven,"
says Mr. Eachus, watching Bella gnaw at the bars of her cage.
Asked if there's anything a pit bull such as Bella won't
bite, Mr. Eachus responds, "A 747 jetliner -- flight."

   England is renowned as a nation of dog lovers, a land
where corgis trail Queen Elizabeth II and where shoppers park
their poodles in a carpeted kennel at Harrods department
store. Queen Victoria even shared her deathbed with a
Pomeranian. But England's long affair with dogs has soured.
Aggressive breeds such as pit bulls and Rottweilers are
suddenly in vogue, and as their numbers have risen, so have
reports of dog attacks. The result is public panic,
Parliamentary debate and press headlines suggestive of "The
Hound of the Baskervilles":
   "Devil Dog Scars Tot"
   "Girl, 8, Scalped in Dog Horror."
   England isn't the first country to do battle with
dangerous dogs, but it may be unique in the lethal force it
is deploying. Some animal wardens are arming themselves with
riot shields, chain mail, and ultrasonic stun guns. "Heroes
get bit," explains Mr. Eachus, an inspector with the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA),
which is often called to handle vicious dogs. In a country
where gun control is so strict that most police go unarmed,
Mr. Eachus is licensed to pack a .32 automatic pistol in his
van.
   "We need that kind of weaponry to control humans, not
dogs," Micky Niego, an official with the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says of the varied
English arsenal. Some U.S. wardens carry tranquilizing darts
and Mace, but most prefer nets and rods with loops.
   The English say their situation demands special tactics.
Unlike the U.S., where rabies has led to tight animal
control, England is free of the disease and has no dog
licensing, no leash law and, in many areas, no dog wardens.
England's pet-obsessed public also can be feral in defending
animal rights. "The English worry more about the welfare of
poor little pooch than they do about the safety of Joe
Public," says Mr. Eachus, an American who has been living in
England since 1977.
   The English also resist the notion that some breeds may be
tough to tame. "People think a little loving care will turn
pit bulls into nice pets," says Roger Mugford, an animal
psychologist in London. "They're wrong." Mr. Mugford echoes
the view of many English experts in describing the dogs as
fearless, almost immune to pain, "and able to turn from
playful jokers into psychopathic killers without a moment's
warning."
   Some dog warriors are taking no chances. Standing beside
her van in the north England city of Bradford, Pat Harwood
dons the latest in canine battle dress. Long blond curls
vanish beneath a visored helmet designed for riot control by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Hands slip into
elbow-length gloves. She cradles a reinforced plastic
"Armadillo Tactical Riot Shield," used by police to repel
missiles. Her tall frame is enveloped by a zip-up jump suit,
lined with chain mesh and heavily padded.
   "I feel like I'm inside a Brillo Pad," says the warden,
her voice muffled by the helmet's visor. Ms. Harwood uses the
suit only for emergencies, but she never patrols without her
"Dazer," a pocket-sized weapon designed to startle dogs with
a high-frequency squeal. "It's important to intimidate," says
her boss, senior warden Terry Singh.
   Some say such gladiators are barking up the wrong tree.
"If you approach a pit bull looking like a creature from
Mars, he's more likely to go berserk and bite you," says
Kevin McNicholas, a veteran London dog warden.
   Answering a call on his van's radio phone, Mr. McNicholas
races to a suburban home whose residents are alarmed by a
gnashing sound from an adjoining yard. He finds a huge German
shepherd ripping apart the fence between the two yards with
its fangs. When the dog bounds toward him, Mr. McNicholas
kneels, clicks his tongue and slips a rope around the dog's
neck. "It doesn't need to be Waterloo every time you take a
dog in," he says, calmly guiding the animal into his van.
   On another call, an anxious woman points into her
neighbor's yard, where two dummies hang from trees, their
pants legs in shreds. The woman says her neighbors often
stand in the yard shouting "Kill]" as two pit bulls tear the
effigies apart. Mr. McNicholas's advice: If the dogs come
close, stand perfectly still, avoid eye contact, and, if
possible, whimper like a puppy. "Dog biscuits also help," he
says. The most lethal weapon he has ever employed is a fire
extinguisher. In eight years of service, he hasn't been
bitten.
   Many other officials haven't been so lucky. There were
7,717 dog attacks on mailmen last year; dozens of police were
injured. London police also are receiving twice as many calls
about dangerous dogs as they did just six months ago. While
fatal attacks remain rare (one or two a year compared to an
average of 15 in the U.S.), there now are an estimated
500,000 strays on English streets and crowded dog pounds with
cages marked "Mad] Take Care]"
   Despite strong lobbying by police, postmen, the RSPCA and
other groups, Parliament narrowly rejected a dog registration
law in May. But the government now is considering banning
some breeds, or requiring that such dogs be muzzled in
public. "It sounds like hysteria until a Rottweiler chews
your kid to pieces," says Bill Wadman-Taylor, a veterinarian
and head of the Battersea Dogs Home in London.
   Bill Edmond, head of Britain's Kennel Club, says the RSPCA
and other groups are overreacting. "The problem is people,
not dogs," he says. "Irresponsible owners can make any dog
vicious." His organization opposes dog licensing and other
restrictions "because the people who are neglecting their
dogs, or training them to attack, are the very same people
who won't comply with the licensing law."
   The RSPCA's Mr. Eachus doesn't hesitate to get tough with
both mad dogs and Englishmen. The chain-smoking inspector has
shot two dogs to death and donned riot gear to take in many
others. In his van, he carries a forensic kit containing a
magnifying glass, camera and tweezers to collect evidence
such as dried blood and dogs' hair for use in prosecuting
owners.
   "There's no room for amateurism here," says the veteran
enforcer. He can quote chapter and verse from English dog
law, such as the 1847 statute citing owners for "suffering to
be at large a ferocious unmuzzled dog," and more recent laws
regarding the fouling of sidewalks with what some
euphemistically call "dog-logs."
   Mr. Eachus predicts that the craze for pit bulls and other
macho dogs will peak in a few years, as it has in the U.S. In
the meantime, though, "we need to get dangerous dogs off the
street and their owners behind bars," he says.
   Officials fear, however, that another creature may soon
terrorize England. The RSPCA recently received a panicked
phone call reporting that a wild boar was running amok in a
London street. It turned out to be a Vietnamese pot-bellied
pig, a faddish pet in America that is just now reaching
English shores.

an asteroid striking Earth or even the more immediate peril of being maimed by
an L.A. cop.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HOW MAN'S BEST FRIEND IS TURNING INTO A MENACE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Martinez is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     I mean the growing number of emotionally unstable dogs among us.;    While
I have often worried about the melting Arctic ice cap and lethal bacteria in
my chicken, I have rarely concerned myself with maniacal pets.;    Now,
however, I am told this is something I ought to worry about so, by God, I'm
going to.;    I am not about to soar through middle age eating fat-free foods,
exercising regularly, avoiding stressful situations and shunning alcoholic
beverages only to have my throat ripped open by a homicidal Lhasa apso. As I
understand it, the problem is twofold: purebreds that are the result of
incestuous relationships and hybrids born from cross-breeding with wolves.;
Just as bad breeding of one type or another has created its share of maniacs
among humans, we have now extended that practice to Canis Familiaris with
similar results. Instead of just worrying about pit bulls, shepherds, Dobies
or Rottweilers, we can concern ourselves with Chihuahuas whose parents were
brother and sister, and collies with wolf blood.;    Imagine Lassie turning on
little Timmy? Imagine Benji menacing Baby Bumpkin? Anything is possible.;
Vicious dogs are in the news these days for various reasons, most recent the
use and misuse of them by -- who else? -- the Los Angeles Police Department.;
  Like their handlers, police dogs have demonstrated an inability to
distinguish good guys from bad guys, with predictable consequences.;    This
has stirred a campaign against vicious dogs, an offshoot of which has been to
revive a crusade to regulate in-breeding and cross-breeding. The Senate is not
likely to question Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas about his stand on
dog-breeding, but there are those who think it should.;    Among them are
L.A.'s own Barbara Fabricant, a captain in her self-founded Humane Task Force.
Wherever a domestic animal is being beaten, eaten or otherwise provoked, you
will find Fabricant calling for mercy. But this time, she is on the side of us
humans. She cornered me one day to demand I do something about a growing
tendency to cross-breed dogs with wolves, which is creating new strains of
vicious pets.;    "There are 300,000 of these things in the country now and
it's got to be stopped!" she said.;    I replied honestly that animal breeding
of any type was not high on my agenda and, in fact, I was beginning to lose
interest in human breeding. But then one day recently my son brought home a
dog that is part wolf, and Fabricant's warning took on new meaning.;    The
situation is not unlike that of ignoring the problem of public nudity until
one discovers his daughter has signed on as a topless dancer in a cowboy bar.;
   Our new dog's name is Sharmi. Up until now the only potentially lethal
behavior she has exhibited is a tendency to try licking a hole in my hand, a
display of sweetness I find barely tolerable.;    I had a hard time accepting
that in my kids.;    Armed with literature furnished by Fabricant, I am
informed that hybrids, as we call the wolf-dog combination, suffer "conditions
of irreconcilable conflict" and are apt to become schizophrenic.;    Fabricant
insists the same thing happens when pups are born from incestuous
relationships. Carrying the Oedipus complex into doghood, she points out that
breeders, in order to save money, will even combine mothers and sons to sire
purebreds they sell for hundreds of dollars.;    What this does, she says, is
create a crazy dog.;    "Anything can set them off and they become violent,
just like dingy humans. Even a cocker spaniel, if you can imagine anything
more mild-mannered, is a trotting time bomb if he's in-bred.";    Wolf-dogs,
she says, are similarly unpredictable. Something as simple as a cough can
spook them into seeing you as nothing more formidable than a tree squirrel,
which they love.;    What had been licking your hand a moment before, is now
regarding you as an early dinner.;    Lawyers whose pro bono talents are
limited to suing have always benefited from vicious dogs. Fabricant says the
benefits have now extended to insurance companies that are canceling liability
policies of those who own wolf hybrids.;    That is one more reason, Fabricant
says, not to own a vicious pet. I'm with her. We've got enough to worry about
in the world without allowing demented dogs running loose, however they arrive
at their dementia. Keeping an eye out for demented cops is a full-time job in
itself.  </TEXT>

   OK, What Rhymes

   Raw Chicken Necks?

   Answer: Dogue de Bordeaux,
   A Breed New to Many
   And a True Power Dog
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Douglas Quinn was so taken with the phlegmatic
dog star of the movie "Turner &amp; Hooch" that he took out a
classified ad seeking a "Hooch" pup. "I liked the dog, and I
want it. That's all," says Mr. Quinn, a man of few words and
the father of 3 1/2-year-old twin boys in Barry, Ontario. So
far, no response to the ad.
   Just wait till Mr. Quinn finds out that the gargoyle-faced
dogue de Bordeaux can cost as much as $1,800, weighs 125
pounds and craves 12 pounds of raw chicken necks each day,
plus kibble. "It isn't easy to get chicken necks," concedes
Peter Curley, the breeder who supplied four dogs for the
movie, which also stars Tom Hanks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Curley adds that though the dogue may have achieved a
certain vogue thanks to Hollywood, smart (as in fashionable)
doesn't necessarily mean smart (as in intelligent). "The only
thing you can train the Bordeaux to do is eat and sleep,"
says Mr. Curley, who now is branching out to an even rarer
breed: the presa de Canario, known as "the gripping dog" of
the Canary Islands. Mr. Curley expects that strong-jawed
beast to be popular at dog shows and to command maybe $2,500.
   The Bordeaux and the presa are power dogs -- not mere pets
but status symbols. "I'm sure it happens that there are
people who buy dogs like they buy cars," says Peter L.
Borchelt, an animal psychologist in Forest Hills, N.Y.
   Carol Lea Benjamin, a New York author whose book
"Second-Hand Dog" is a paean to the mongrel, notes that
"breeds are often chosen because somebody famous has one" --
the president of the U.S., say, or an admired movie star.
Appreciating that fact, the International Kennel Club, which
is really just a pet store in Manhattan, sometimes manages to
plant items in the gossip columns disclosing that an actor --
Bruce Willis, for instance -- is taking delivery of some
Akita pups or that singer Roberta Flack has a fox-faced shiba
inu. Gilt by association, in other words. It is supposed to
move dogs, and it undoubtedly does.
   People magazine recently predicted that the bichon frise,
a bit of fluff whose name means curly- haired lap-dog, will
be one of the top five dogs of the 1990s, "style-wise." And
in no time at all, Tina Geores, a New Jersey breeder, was
advertising it as "the most stylish dog of the '90s."
   Ms. Geores claims the bichon is getting more and more
popular "with very trendy people, people in show business,"
people like Carly Simon, the singer and songwriter. "They are
such a pleasant little dog," Ms. Geores says. "They're easy
to travel with. They're easy to live with." They cost between
$650 and $1,200.
   The authoritative American Kennel Club, which is not a pet
store in Manhattan, is a little slower on the uptake than
readers of People. It recognizes only 130 breeds, and the
Bordeaux and shiba inu aren't two of them. The AKC each year
lists the top 10 breeds (in terms of registrations), and most
are not exotic power dogs. Cockers and Labs, poodles, golden
retrievers and German shepherds head the list, in that order,
although two currently fashionable breeds, Rottweiler and
chow chow (chow for short), do make the latest top 10.
   "The Rotty is the guard dog of the moment," says John
Mandeville, an AKC judging official. He says the bear-faced
chow is probably the "pre-eminent fad dog." Mr. Mandeville
notes that both dogs tend to be hard to handle, particularly
if they aren't well trained and if the owner isn't assertive.
But, he says, many breed-conscious masters unfortunately
can't see past the pup. "If there's anything cuter than an
eight- or 10-week-old chow puppy, I'm not sure what it is,"
he says. But then one day, the dog owner wakes up to find a
giant, shedding beast (with a blue tongue in the case of the
chow) who wants to be boss. "Cute" can easily enough turn
into "trouble."
   That hasn't kept AKC registrations from reaching an
all-time high, as more Americans seek to spend their mad
money on the perfect dog. The dogue de Bordeaux may not be
it, for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it
originally was bred as a fighting dog. It is said to be good
with children. But it might just have the neighbor's shih tzu
for lunch.
   The border collie (like Mike the Dog in the film "Down and
Out in Beverly Hills") is a current favorite. So are
bulldogs. Jack Russell terriers are popular with the horsy
set. The short-legged Welsh corgi is big (Queen Elizabeth II
has at least one). And so, of course, is the English bull
terrier (thanks to Anheuser-Busch, Bud Light and Spuds
MacKenzie).
   Barbara Bush and the president have been good for English
springer spaniels. Theirs -- Millie and her pups -- have been
good for the Bushes politically. (Yes, Messrs. Reagan, Nixon,
Johnson and Roosevelt had famous dogs, too.) George Bush gave
this advice to a Republican running for Congress in New York:
"One single word. Puppies. Worth 10 points."
   Like politicians, dog breeds have their moment. But the
popular ones get overbred, by puppy mills and others trying
to take advantage of demand. "With anything trendy, there's a
rush to breed for profit," says Mr. Borchelt, the animal
psychologist. "That's no good." Puppy mills turn out dogs
with physical and psychological problems, dogs that can't
handle their aggressive impulses, dogs that bite.
   And ultimately a breed will pass out of fashion, as the
shar-pei seems to be doing now. It is that wrinkly creature
which, as a pup, looks more like a pile of sweat shirts than
a dog.
   On a tour of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, Mr.
Borchelt is interrupted twice by veterinarians seeking his
advice about their patients. An elderly woman has a "nervous
chow," says one. The other confides: "I've got a problem with
an aggressive shar-pei."
   The Chinese shar-pei, or "sand-skin," was nearly extinct
in the 1950s. But, two decades later, it caught on with the
rare-dog breeders and, in 1983, the Neiman Marcus Christmas
catalog featured a pair of shar-pei pups -- at $2,000 each.
The rage began. Today there are more than 50,000 shar-peis.
The price has come down to as little as $100, a sign that the
fad is about played out. And that's only the half of it.
   "The shar-pei is a veterinarian's dream," says Michael
Marder, a Manhattan vet. "I'm seeing a lot of health and
behavioral problems, not life-threatening but chronic," he
says. Skin trouble is especially common.
   Ethel Petry, of Central Point, Ore., is familiar from an
owner's standpoint with the shar-pei's potential for
ailments. She chose her shar-pei puppy largely because his
front paws were "broken down," and she was afraid the
flat-footed dog would be destroyed.
   Timothy, now three years old, cost her a hundred bucks.
But he was no bargain. His doctor bills have been at least
five times that. He contracted a bad case of mange, and he
tends to be sickly. "He can be playing with you one minute,"
Ms. Petry says, "and come down with a temperature of 104
degees the next."
   Efforts to fix the dog's feet failed, and the little pads
on his paws never toughened up. So, "Timothy is a grass-dog.
I never walk him on the street," says his owner. He travels
by car from his backyard to the park for outings. And at
least once, Ms. Petry has had to carry Timothy in her arms to
keep him off the pavement. Still, she says, "We get along."
   Fortunately, passe power dogs seldom seem to end up at the
pound, abandoned by owners who have traded up to a newer
model. Marjorie Stein, manager of adoption services for the
North Shore Animal League in Port Washington, N.Y., says she
sees few of the exotic breeds: "A chichi dog has a much
better chance of getting a home by word of mouth. Generally,
somebody wants it."

and maybe make a little money doing it.;    Prevention;  Long active in
volunteer breed-rescue work, Cannon believes it's better to stop someone from
getting a dog they'll one day get rid of than to find a home for that animal
down the line.;    "I like looking at the breeds and figuring what each is
good for and which ones work best with what people," she said. "I've been
involved with dogs in one way or another for years, showing, training and
doing rescue work. I wanted to alleviate some of the problems of unwanted dogs
by helping people make the best choice.";    A few months ago she got the idea
to turn her hobby into a business, Your Best Friend, that analyzes a
prospective dog-owner's lifestyle and recommends appropriate breeds.;
Several choices;  The process starts with a three-page lifestyle questionnaire
and ends with a recommendation of three or more breeds, along with carefully
researched and well-written sheets detailing the characteristics of the dogs
and tips on finding the right breeder.;    "I talked with breeders and read
all kinds of reference materials when setting this thing up," she said. "A lot
of my own experience is factored in, too. Eventually, I developed a system of
arranging the breeds by characteristics and broken into six size groups.";
So far, Your Best Friend hasn't been successful enough for Cannon to leave her
regular job as a management consultant for the California state government.
She isn't really sure it ever will be. Right now, she says, the $20 she
charges covers her expenses and little more.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;

<LEADPARA>  LONGTIME Dalmatian breeders are concerned that the Dalmatian craze could lead
to careless breeding. And they fear that many dogs may go to families that are

never had a dog before or for families with toddlers.;    "Most breeders fail
to tell you that Dalmatian puppies are little hellions," said Baughn, who has
been breeding Dalmatians for 20 years. "They chew up a lot and they're into
everything. Plus, they are the size dog that will whip around and hit a
toddler with their tail or scare the child.";    The dogs are good protectors
and good with people. But Dalmatians want to be with their owners all the
time.;    "They want to be with you when you're in the house, when you're
outside, when you're sleeping," she said.;    "It's nice that people are

   Your Feb. 7 page-one article regarding Dalmatians is
reminiscent of similar articles on "vicious" pit bulls. Such
generalizations evolve from misunderstanding and ignorance.
Dalmatians, like many purebreds, are especially attentive.
Your statement that they are "an ill-mannered breed if ever
there was one" is without merit. The obedience problems
experienced by the Dalmatian owners cited in the article
sounded more like discipline problems on the part of the
irresponsible owners.
   Owners must not underestimate the commitment necessary to
properly train and accommodate such enthusiastic,
affectionate and intelligent animals.

   I always thought my Dalmatian was so bad because she was
purchased at a pet store renowned for using puppy mills. I
now come to find that I may have the best Dalmatian in the
U.S. True, she has ruined the lawn and done considerable
damage to the house, but she loves my wife and me, and
absolutely adores our 19-month-old daughter. If other people
would realize that pets are members of the family and not
just "things" to have around the house, perhaps they could be
as lucky. A little love goes a long way.

   Cohabiting with a 70-pound Dalmatian is not for the faint
of heart nor, as your article detailed, people of small
stature in high heels. My first clue to the challenge of
"Dal" ownership was when the six-month-old pup reduced me to
tears in dog-obedience class. Duke redeemed himself by
receiving a standing ovation from the class participants upon
receiving the "most improved dog award" at the graduation
ceremonies. His behavior is still reprehensible, so judge for
yourself where we stood before the training lessons.
   Our companion, Duke (known as the "dog from hell" by
friends and family), is fiercely loyal, yet very independent;
lovingly affectionate, yet a ferocious watchdog; people
oriented, yet bowls over small children with his enthusiasm;
and loves his master, yet growls threateningly when removed
from the middle of the bed. If you have not yet experienced
panicked phone calls from your dog sitter while you are
vacationing 2,000 miles away from home, it is an experience
not to be missed.

   We are "fortunate" to own one of the 7% of totally deaf
Dalmatians mentioned in your article. People often stop us
and ask if "Bluto" is a "good" dog.
   Yes, he's good -- good because he has eaten the TV stand,
the "clicker" and a corner off the VCR, but not the TV set.
Yes, he's good -- good because his body stretches across only
one-quarter of our bed, but not the entire bed. Yes, he's
good -- good because he sheds short hair 365 days a year, but
not long hair.
   Why do we keep a dog whose myriad "good" points have
forced us to adopt a "thank God, it could have been worse"
attitude? Because when it comes to loyalty, affection and an
expressive personality, our "denizen of the firehouse"
couldn't offer us any more.

   The name Dalmatian tells of the dogs' origins: the Ottoman
Empire across the Adriatic to Italy in the late 17th to 18th
centuries. They were the typical Greek and Turkish village
dogs, whose coats had large areas of black or brown and
white. Selective breeding from Ragusa to Rome (lots of
puppies into the buckets) produced a spotted dog whose
mission was to prance with the carriages of the nobility.
Their nipping at horses' ankles to make the horses prance and
pace gave Dalmatians their later role in America's firehouses
in the horse-drawn era. Lest we think they are stubborn, they
are -- their job was to leap off the fire wagons (later fire
trucks) and keep people beyond the fire lines. In World War
II, with packs strapped on their backs, they went through
fire and storm as messenger dogs for the U.S. Army.

<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old Michigan child was killed by neighborhood dogs in a
mauling so grisly a doctor likened it to a shark attack, and a
Florida infant had four fingers chewed off by the family pet.
   The body of the Ishpeming, Mich., child was discovered by
neighbors outside the family's home.
   ``It appears she had been chewed upon, right down to the bone,''
said Sgt. Greg Tait of the Michigan State Police. ``Based on what
the doctor saw, he says it resembles a shark attack.''
   Tait said residents pointed out two of three neighborhood dogs
suspected in the attack, and officers killed the animals, identified
as a huskie and a German shepherd. Police were searching for the
third dog Thursday afternoon, he said.
   The child's name was withheld until her parents were notified,
Tait said.
   ``People let their dogs run loose during the day and there have
been as many as 25 in a pack,'' said Annie Trudell, whose store is
across the street from where the attack took place. ``People don't
understand how quickly a family pet can become vicious.''
   In Ocala, Fla., a mixed-breed puppy gnawed four fingers off a
22-day-old girl's right hand.
   The 7-week-old dog was described as three-quarters pit bull and
one-quarter husky.
   Shaye Lynne Emminger was in fair condition at Munroe Regional
Medical Center following the attack Wednesday morning. Her four
fingers were recovered from the puppy's stomach, but doctors could
not reattach them, said Jennifer Fanzlaw of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department.
   The child's parents, Michael Douglas Emminger, 19, and Deborah
Lawson Emminger, 16, awoke to find their child bleeding profusely in
her crib, Fanzlaw said. She said the dog also was in the crib.
   The dog was taken to the pound and killed.
   Investigators said they don't know what prompted the puppy to
bite the child, but they don't believe the dog attacked her
viciously, adding that the child might have had milk or formula on
her fingers.
   ``All puppies chew,'' Fanzlaw said.

<HEAD>School for Seeing Eye Dogs Celebrates 60th Birthday This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE MADER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first school for seeing eye
dogs celebrates its 60th birthday this year with its sights on
public education and expansion.
   ``Back in the '40s and '50s, the public probably knew more about
how guide dogs work than they do now,'' said Dennis J. Murphy,
president of The Seeing Eye Inc. ``It was such a new phenomenon
that people paid attention to it.''
   In 60 years, little has changed in the way the dogs are trained.
But the non-profit school has improved its breeding program and
spent money on research to improve dogs' health, Murphy said.
   ``What has changed is the need to train dogs in a little
different situations,'' he said. ``The dogs now ride on buses and
trains.''
   About 85 percent of the dogs trained by The Seeing Eye _ mainly
German shepherds and Labrador retrievers _ are born at the school's
breeding station in Mendham Township, said Doug Roberts, director
of training. A few dogs are donated.
   Over the years, breeding has reduced the size of the dogs _ from
120 pounds to 70 pounds _ as apartments and cars have gotten
smaller, Murphy said.
   Shortly after birth, the dogs are placed for a year with 275 4-H
families in New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware,
Murphy said. The dogs are taught basic obedience, given affection
and put into a variety of situations, such as car rides, Murphy
said.
   The school trains about 320 dogs each year. A kennel to be built
in the next two years will help the program expand to 400 dogs,
Murphy said.
   After 12 weeks, most of the dogs are ready to be placed with a
blind person, Roberts said. Eighteen people from throughout the
United States and Canada are brought to Morristown in northern New
Jersey for a month of instruction in dog handling.
   There is a six- to nine-month waiting list to get a dog.
Recipients usually must be at least 16 years old so they are
responsible enough to care for the dog, Murphy said.
   The cost for a first-time dog owner is $150, the same as 60
years ago, Roberts said. Owners looking for a replacement dog pay
$50.
   The Seeing Eye is one of 10 dog training schools in the United
States, says Lori Scholz, the school's spokeswoman.
   Michele T. Drolet, 35, of Morristown coordinates fund-raising
for The Seeing Eye. She is blind and has used guide dogs since 1974.
   ``It's a social icebreaker,'' Ms. Drolet says. ``With a cane
people tend to avoid you. They don't know how to talk to you.
   ``With a dog, they forget about the master and want to talk
about the dog.''

<TEXT>     Why the fuss? Hamil's five dogs are more than 80 percent wolf.;    After
dancing with Kevin Costner on the big screen, wolves are in. And wolves
crossed with dogs are the closest people can come to legally owning one.;
An estimated 15,000 wolf hybrids are being kept as pets in California alone.
Wolf-dog puppies sell quickly for more than $400, many to aggressive owners
seeking another macho breed.;    As more people try to get closer to nature,
conflicts between man and dog -- or man and wolf -- are on the rise, sometimes
with tragic results. In April and May, two infants had their arms severed by
wolf hybrids. One Fort Wayne, Ind., 2-year-old bled to death.;     Claiming
that wolf dogs are dangerous, animal control officials in Santa Clara County
and nationwide are seeking to restrict the pets with "wild animal"
designations. Public health officials want to ban them, fearing that rabies
shots may be ineffective.;    Owners of wolf hybrids say the handful of
problems with the wolf dogs should be blamed on irresponsible pet owners, not
the breed.;    And states such as California, under fire from both sides, are
grappling with the complex legal question: Are hybrids wild wolves or domestic
dogs?;    Out of its world;  "It's really an animal that can't fit into either
world," said Randy Lockwood, vice president of field services for the Humane
Society of the United States. "It can't live in the wild. It can't live in the
home. There is no legitimate reason to own one.";    Owners of wolf hybrids
vehemently disagree. They describe the bonding between human and wolf in
mystical terms. "They are like our children," says one. "They are the most
gentle creatures alive," says another.;    "Too many people want to believe
the myth of the big bad wolf," said Donna Stephen, founder of the West Coast
Wolf Hybrid Association who has five wolf dogs at her Airwolf Kennels in
Morgan Hill. "I've never, ever had a problem. I can't understand why people
call them vicious.";    Owners of wolf hybrids correctly point out that many
other dog breeds are more aggressive. Pit bulls are responsible for the most
fatalities, followed by German shepherds, according to the American Medical
Association.;    Ann Hamil's wolf dogs cower when an airplane flies overhead.
They accept strangers with caution, but with no sign of aggression.;    Hamil
and others say they own hybrids to show the naturally passive nature of wolves
and enhance the reputation of pure wolves in the wild.;    "We see it as a
good opportunity to educate people about the wolf coming so close to
extinction," said Hamil, who has owned her hybrids for five years. "An amazing
(number) of people are curious.";    Crossed with fierce breeds;  Perhaps too
curious. Wolf dogs increasingly are being bought by people looking for
aggressive attack animals, longtime hybrid lovers admit. And in get-rich-quick
puppy mills, wolf hybrids are being crossed with fierce breeds. Others are
paraded in pickup trucks as status symbols, taught to be mean against their
instincts.;    "Captivity can provoke unpredictability," said Terry Jenkins of
Folsom, who got out of the breeding business after two pups she sold mauled
children.;    Jenkins now is head zoo keeper at the Folsom City Zoo east of
Sacramento, where the focus is "to educate people that wild animals make bad
pets.";    The zoo is a magnet for Northern Californians whose dreams of a
perfect pet have gone awry. At least once a week, Jenkins gets a call from the
owner of a wolf dog desperate to get rid of the animal because it won't accept
strangers, it can't be housebroken or it chases children.;    "We get so many
people who were not prepared in the slightest for the problems," Jenkins said.
"Most bought a puppy and didn't know it would be any different than a dog.";
 The U.S. Humane Society, which opposes breeding wolves with dogs, says too
many hybrids end up roaming free. Some are shot attacking livestock; others
are hit by cars. Packs of wolf hybrids have prevented the reintroduction of
pure wolves in Yellowstone National Park, Lockwood said.;    When the Humane
Society of Santa Clara Valley captured a recent stray, it was killed. "We
can't take a chance and adopt them out," said Stacy Hill, a spokeswoman for
the society.;    Not after a Florida panhandle animal welfare agency paid
$425,000 last October to settle with the family of a 4-year-old boy who was
killed by a wolf hybrid. Just two hours after it had been adopted from the
shelter, the animal jumped a fence and attacked.;    Eight states have adopted
laws either restricting or prohibiting wolf hybrids. But there's a catch.
There is no scientific way to prove what is, or isn't, a wolf hybrid. So in
California, the animals fall between the regulatory cracks.;    The state
Department of Fish and Game requires a wildlife permit for first-generation
wolf hybrids. The animals are supposed to remain fenced on their owners'
property. But though thousands of hybrids are thought to live in the state,
fewer than 30 permits have been issued, permit captain Rod Simon said.;
"When I tell people they need a permit, they kind of lie," Simon said. "They
say it really doesn't have much wolf and there's nothing I can do.";    Fenced
or not, hybrids could be a public health threat, say officials at the state
Department of Health Services. "Hybrids are not dogs: There are distinct
metabolic differences," state veterinarian Kevin Reilly said. "There is no
proof a canine rabies vaccine works on them.";    But Reilly's department has
no animal enforcement authority.;    With little state regulation, Santa Clara
County hopes to join a handful of California counties that have declared wolf
hybrids "wild animals." The law would give animal control officers the power
to inspect the homes of wolf hybrid owners and, in the event of a problem, to
restrict the animal.;    Supporters of wolf hybrids insist the animals are not
the problem.;    "You work on ways to make people responsible owners," said
Morgan Hill veterinarian John Quick.;    If any restriction is needed, said
Pat Brienen, who owns a wolf hybrid in Santa Cruz, it is on who buys the wolf
dogs.;    "It's like guns," he said. "People who can't handle that type of
power shouldn't be allowed to have them."  </TEXT>

   The government says it is ready to consider
banning a dangerous breed of dog called ``bandog'' _ a cross
between a pit bull terrier and a bigger breed, such as a rottweiler.
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
described the 130-pound dogs as ``Darwinian nightmares'' capable of
killing any human being in a one-to-one fight.
   Asked about a possible ban, Home Secretary David Waddington said
Friday: ``I'm prepared to look at anything. I think it's a very,
very serious situation.''
   He said Britain strengthened legislation governing dangerous
breeds last summer so courts now can order dangerous animals
destroyed.
   ``But certainly one has got to look to see if the law is tough
enough to give sufficient protection to the public against people
who take around streets of the land these terribly fierce dogs,''
he said.
   He said there was a problem in naming certain breeds of dog in
legislation because other breeds could then be developed.

<P>
Around the arena, owners will be busy grooming and cajoling their charges into
center-ring readiness.
</P>
<P>
Between judgings, a troupe of Dobermans will jump through hoops and barrels and
will scale walls. In the scent relay, teams of dogs will jump over hurdles and
locate the jackets of their owners. There will also be a demonstration of how
dogs herd farm animals.
</P>
<P>
Other attractions include the appearance of Warren Eckstein, radio host of "Pet
Show," who will answer behavioral questions about dogs (as well as cats, pigs
and goldfish, if he's asked); free veterinary advice; a demonstration of how
4-H youngsters help train puppies to become guide dogs, and more than 70
vendors selling dog paraphernalia. A computer is provided for visitors' use to
find out which breeds would best suit their life styles.
</P>
<P>
Show hours are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: adults, $4.50; children, $1.

   In a sunlit New England meadow, Kolya
stretches out among his sheep for a snooze.
   Even in dozy repose, he investigates anyone approaching the
flock.
   And when eyes meet, there is little doubt who's in charge - it's
the Shar Planinetz, a huge, lion-like dog with majestic blue mane
bred to protect the flocks in the mountains of Yugoslavia from
wolves.
   Kolya is one of the first of the breed to be used successfully
against coyotes by a pair of Hampshire College biologists.
   Nearly 15 years after Ray and Lorna Coppinger began
experimenting with rare breeds from remote corners of Europe,
thousands of the big dogs are watching over flocks in the American
West.
   And like good shepherds, the Coppingers are keeping an eye on
the big, deceptively placid breeds.
   ``They are still the best non-lethal method we've got to protect
sheep against coyotes and other predators on the open range,''
Coppinger said.
   ``We thought we'd place out and follow 100 dogs and that would
be the end of the research, but we're up to 1,221 now and still at
it,'' Mrs. Coppinger said. ``The sheep producers wouldn't let us
stop.''
   She estimates that with offspring of dogs and the work of other
groups, there are 4,000 to 5,000 guard dogs protecting flocks.
   ``They are an answer to all of us,'' said Sandy Petersen, a
rancher in Sidney, Mont., who leaves her two guard dogs alone with
her flock of 350 purebred sheep. ``They eat a lot, but it's nothing
compared to the cost of losing the lambs to coyotes and you don't
have to get involved in poison. They keep us in business.''
   Initially skeptical, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is now
promoting sheep-guarding dogs with pamphlets and videos.
   In some areas of the West, the dogs have significantly changed
the way ranchers manage flocks, said Tom MacDonald of the American
Sheep Producers Association. They are particularly effective on
desert range, where a pair of dogs can protect 1,000 ewes, he said.
   Some Colorado ranchers have told the association their losses
have been cut from 450 sheep a year to a dozen or so.
   And not just from coyotes.
   At the Coppingers' farm recently a student was training a pair
of beguiling, white Maremma pups headed for the area around
Yellowstone Park, where ranchers are nervous about plans to
reintroduce wolves.
   In a test in Minnesota, a single dog kept a small wolf pack from
a bait station for 30 nights, until the wolves finally combined
forces to drive off the dog, Coppinger said.
   ``We put him back the next night with a second dog and it went
back to a standoff,'' he said. Despite nightly confrontations, the
two dogs deterred the wolves until the experiment was ended 30
nights later.
   Typically, the dogs chase away, rather than kill.
   ``One of the primary aims of any predator is to keep itself
healthy, because it can't hunt for food when it's hurt. So they
will back off in the face of the threat of likely harm,'' Mrs.
Coppinger said.
   Supported by a newly created association of guard dog users,
Mrs. Coppinger is compiling a computerized registry of dogs on
American farms and ranches, their working characteristics and blood
lines.
   Although some crossbreeds have been successful, and the Tibetan
mastiff also is used, most of the sheep-guarding dogs in the United
States are European breeds.
   Some, such as the Great Pyrenees from the mountains along the
French-Spanish border and the Komondor and Kuvasz from Hungary, had
also become popular as pets. But others - the Anatolian shepherd,
the Akbash dog from Turkey, the Maremma from Italy, the Shar
Planinetz of Yugoslavia and the Polish Tatra - were little known
outside the sheep-raising areas of the Old World.
   The only American entry is a smaller strain, developed by the
Navahos in Arizona to defend flocks against coyotes, Mrs. Coppinger
said.
   Little research had been done linking dogs' personality traits
to genetics when the Coppingers first began their studies in the
1970s.
   They found that through years of breeding, the guard dogs'
psychological development had been arrested in the beguiling stage
f puppyhood when little animals affectionately lick and touch
their litter mates. They stay close to the nest and are suspicious
of anything new, reacting to an intrusion with a panicked bark or
snap.
   The dogs also lack good species recognition patterns and when
raised with sheep or other animals are ``unclear about who or what
is and isn't a dog,'' Coppinger said. ``They may think of sheep as
dogs, or llamas as dogs or people as dogs.''
   So a Shar Planinetz will lie down peacefully with its lambs but
will stand menacingly between its flock and danger.
   ``They seem to be able to set up limits and lines that are not
to be crossed,'' Mrs. Coppinger said. ``And once they have bonded
with the sheep, that's really the only training they need to guard.
''
   Roger Woodruff, a researcher at the University of Oregon, and
Jeffrey Green of the University of Idaho also began importing guard
dogs in the 1970s in a separate program. Woodruff, now with the
USDA, said their basic behavioral findings were similar.
   ``We were more oriented to immediate application and let it go
after placing 60 dogs,'' he said. ``The Coppingers have done a lot
of real in-depth behavioral and basic scientific research.''
   The dogs only watch and protect; they won't herd sheep.
   ``They don't see sheep as prey as a border collie does, but as
another dog,'' Coppinger said. ``You can't even get them to chase a
ball. It's just not in their makeup.''

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Ordinance Restricting Ownership of Pit Bulls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact an
Overland Park, Kan., ordinance restricting the ownership and
possession of ``pit bull dogs.''
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague.
   Lawyers for 13 owners of dogs told the justices the 1987
ordinance ``does not even attempt to offer a standard for the
police or dog owners to use when trying to determine whether a
particular dog is subject to the ordinance.''
   ``Anti-pit bull laws and ordinances are now sweeping the
country,'' the appeal said, ``and constitutional challenges on
vagueness grounds have been mounted in dozens of counties and
states, with inconsistent results. This ordinance is among the very
worst offenders.''
   The appeal said trial judges in California, Florida, Minnesota
and Washington state have struck down anti-pit bull ordinances for
being too vaguely worded.
   The Overland Park ordinance deems pit bull dogs ``dangerous
animals'' that must be kept indoors or restrained and muzzled at
all times.
   Pit bull dogs are defined by the ordinance to include
Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers,
American Pit Bull Terriers, or dogs that ``have the appearance and
characteristics of being predominantly of (those) breeds of dogs.''
   The ordinance also requires pit bull owners to acquire a $50,000
liability insurance policy to compensate for any damage caused by
the animals. Owners who fail to comply may be criminally liable,
and could face substantial fines and up to 30 days in jail.
   A state judge and the Kansas Supreme Court upheld the ordinance.
   Noting in its ruling last April 4 that no constitutionally
protected conduct is being limited, the state Supreme Court said
the ordinance is worded precisely enough.
   ``The ordinance, as interpreted by the Overland Park Police
Department, applies only to animals in which pit bull dog
characteristics predominate,'' the state court said. ``Ultimate,
god-like precision is not required.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the dog owners said
the ordinance ``on its face lacks even a rudimentary core meaning.''
   The case is Hearn vs. Overland Park, 89-412.

<P>
The hundred-pound-plus Rottweiler, jaws as big as a suitcase, strains at the
end of his leash, whoofing and itching for a chance to attack.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ann Hill gives the command, and Sasko clamps his massive chops down on
the protective leather sleeve held by trainer Brad Franz. After a few seconds
of twisting and tugging, Hill calls her dog off, and Sasko is sweet as sugar.
</P>
<P>
"He's my baby," says Hill, of Yorba Linda, the wife of former Los Angeles Rams'
tight end David Hill. "I don't think (my husband would) have any other kind of
dog. I just feel so safe."
</P>
<P>
Safer, no doubt, than the ill-advised intruder who would invade the territory
of Sasko, or any other well-trained guard dog -- such as Ashley, Jeannie
Salazar's black German shepherd. Salazar, who lives in Santa Ana, took her dog
to protection training classes for two years.
</P>
<P>
"It was in her breeding," Salazar said. "I can take her to the park, and she's
great around the kids. But if anyone comes around the house, forget it. No one
even comes up to the gate."
</P>
<P>
Burglar alarms are cleaner and don't need feeding. Deadbolts are cheaper. But a
dog -- particularly one schooled in protection -- remains one of the most
effective methods of improving home security.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of a dog in a back yard will keep intruders outside," said
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. "They bark and make a racket. That will
certainly deter someone from going back there."
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Michael Gray, head of the Anaheim Police Department's community services
bureau, says residents at neighborhood watch meetings often ask about the
advisability of purchasing dogs to guard their homes.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend anything that would make a person feel more comfortable in their
home, and more secure," Gray said. "There are ways to defeat a dog -- throw it
meat and such -- but they're definitely a deterrent. . . . If you're going to
have one, you ought to have it trained."
</P>
<P>
An untrained dog can be either too vicious -- presenting both safety and
liability problems -- or too passive, providing no real security, say police as
well as dog trainers and breeders.
</P>
<P>
"If you have control over your dog, then you really won't have problems," said
Tom Tackett, a trainer and breeder in Orange. "If the dog is not in control, if
it's just plain mean, well, then you don't have much of anything."
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth agrees that a trained guard dog is better than simply a vicious one --
but even then, he has reservations about the presence of large, dangerous dogs
in family neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
"There are numerous occurences in a residential neighborhoods, like when a kid
kicks a ball over into your yard and he goes to retrieve it, where a guard dog
might react differently from the average dog," Hedgpeth said.
</P>
<P>
Tackett, who runs his business out of his home, says he turns away more than
half the dogs brought to him for protection training.
</P>
<P>
"What I like to see in a dog is that they're very sociable, friendly and
self-confident," Tackett said. "If he has those traits, we can train him."
</P>
<P>
A "sharp" dog, on the other hand -- a dog that is quick to snap if startled, or
one that shows its teeth and tries hard to look vicious -- is not a good
guard-dog candidate, Tackett said.
</P>
<P>
"A dog that's sharp, quite often he's got some insecurities," he said. "He's
putting up some kind of bluff."
</P>
<P>
A stress test allows Tackett to quickly assess a dog's confidence and
aggression levels. With the dog on a tether, the trainer slowly approaches him
from the side, establishes eye contact, and then comes at the dog straight on,
waving a bag or stick.
</P>
<P>
Some dogs can't handle the stress and show extreme fear. Others raise their
hackles and bare their teeth, hoping to scare the attacker. "The ideal dog is
at the end of the cable, barking, tail up, muscles forward," Tackett said.
"He's saying, 'OK, you want to fight? Great, let's go.' "
</P>
<P>
Then, the trainer drops the threat and quickly tries to befriend the dog.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal dog can handle all of that," Tackett said. "Some freak out."
</P>
<P>
Some breeds make better guard dogs than others. Rottweilers, German shepherds
and Belgian Malinois -- an increasingly popular breed, particularly with law
enforcement agencies -- are ideal for protection work, trainers agree. Hunting
dogs, such as golden retrievers, are normally too friendly. "They're too
passive, too easygoing," Tackett said.
</P>
<P>
Terriers, however, do "extremely well," he said. "They're small, but they don't
think they are. . . . A dog 45 pounds and up can handle himself and take out a
man."
</P>
<P>
Dobermans, while menacing, are not the most reliable breed, and tend more than
some others to bark unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
Pit bulls? "We don't see them too often," said Tony Terrazas of K-9 Companions,
which operates out of Yorba Linda and Riverside. "Their owners believe their
dogs are aggressive as is. . . . What they've got is a gun without a safety."
</P>
<P>
Mixed breeds sometimes turn out to be trainable, but if what you really want is
a first-class, four-legged bodyguard, you should buy a dog that has been bred
for that kind of work, Terrazas said.
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to put your money into it, you want a Cadillac," Terrazas
said.
</P>
<P>
An untrained Rottweiler costs between $800 and $1,500, while a trained dog of
that breed might sell for $2,500, according to Terrazas. German shepherds are
somewhat less expensive.
</P>
<P>
Dogs with champion bloodlines, however, cost much more.
</P>
<P>
One of Tackett's Rottweilers -- 10 year-old Bruno von der Herzogslinde -- cost
$10,000, while Arras Zur Spielmanns-Au, a former world champion and the
grandfather of a recent litter of "Rotties" at Tackett's house -- all of which
were sold before birth -- is worth about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
These dogs, and others with similar bloodlines, are entered in Schutzhund
(protection dog) competitions, which test a dog's skills -- including its
ability to run and knock down a man wearing a full protective body suit.
</P>
<P>
"You teach them to tackle like a linebacker," Tackett said. "Some of the
trainers have gotten cracked ribs . . . and most of them end up with bad backs.
It's very physical work."
</P>
<P>
Training a dog can cost from $300 for basic obedience to $3,000 and up for
advanced, specialized protection training.
</P>
<P>
For about $800, a dog can be trained to provide an acceptable level of
protection, Tackett said.
</P>
<P>
"He'll alert when told, and bite if someone gets aggressive," Tackett said.
</P>
<P>
Both Tackett and Terrazas agree that the demand for protection dogs has
increased in recent years. "It used to be 10% of my business; now it's probably
40%," Tackett said.
</P>
<P>
Terrazas says that business often picks up after highly publicized crimes, such
as the Night Stalker murders or the 1988 killing of auto racing figure Mickey
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, more people want it," Terrazas said.
</P>
<P>
Ann Hill said she got her first guard dog because her husband was out of town
so often "and the football schedule's right there in the paper for everyone to
read."
</P>
<P>
"The dog's great with the kids," said Hill, who has two young boys. "And we
don't get too many magazine salesmen."

<LEADPARA>  It's a dog's life for Bill McFadden.;    The 32-year-old professional dog
handler knows that the secret to producing champions is just plain, doggone
hard work. He puts in 18-hour days grooming and conditioning his charges. And,
like a racehorse jockey, he crisscrosses the country showing the dogs for a

<TEXT>     McFadden and his wife, Taffe, run their dog handling business in Campbell
and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings. Those who
think you can get rich handling dogs are barking up the wrong tree.;    "We
make a good living but the overhead is high and the hours long. Before a show
we sometimes work around the clock brushing and cleaning the dogs, working on
their coats," said McFadden. "And breeds such as poodles have to be highly
trimmed.";    McFadden said he handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each
show and works around 120 shows a year all over the U.S. The dogs are frequent
winners in best of breed and best of show categories. "We finish with close to
100 champions a year," he said.;    As a handler, McFadden emphasizes that he
doesn't do obedience training. His job is to trim and condition the dogs and
prepare them physically and mentally. The aim, he said, is to have a
"confident and happy dog" entering a competition.;    Over the last seven
years, McFadden and his wife have shown dogs representing approximately 75
percent of the 135 breeds of dog. Taffe McFadden, a Vancouver, British
Columbia native who has been involved in dog handling since she was a child,
specializes in poodles. The couple also owns two standard poodles and breed
wire fox terriers.;    McFadden's latest product, a Kerry blue terrier named
Kerrageen's Hotspur, won the best of show prize at the 81st Golden Gate Kennel
Club Dog Show held Feb. 2-3 at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. More than
2,000 purebred dogs participated in the national competition.;    It was the
37th best in show win by Kerrageen's Hotspur, making him the top Kerry blue
terrier of all time. The dog is owned by Bryan Percy and Judy Hertwell of
Seattle.;    Kerrageen's Hotspur was scheduled to join McFadden in New York
City last week for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square
Garden. Recognized as one of the most prestigious shows in all of dogdom,
Westminster is also, with the exception of the Kentucky Derby, the longest
continuous sporting event held in the U.S.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Britain banned the import of American pit bull terriers effective today in

<TEXT>     The government also is considering urgent legislation ordering the humane
destruction of all potential killer dogs in the country. The law could be
introduced by summer.;    Public outrage erupted over the weekend when
Rucksana Khan was mauled by a pit bull. Passersby were unable to force the dog
to release the girl until she had suffered broken ribs, a lacerated lung, a
broken nose, two knocked-out teeth and multiple bruises and bites.;    It was
the latest in a series of vicious attacks by fighting dogs, half of them
American pit bulls.;    Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, whose party had
demanded an immediate ban on the import of fighting dogs, announced his strong
support for the government action. The legislation would also ban the Japanese
tosa, a fighting breed that can reach 200 pounds and is considered extremely
vicious.;    The Labor Party's home affairs spokesman, Roy Hattersley, today
will demand in Parliament introduction of a dog-registration program, which
the government previously has opposed as unworkable.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THANKS to the 30th-anniversary release of "101 Dalmatians," the American
Kennel Club reports that kids and parents across the country are scrambling to
find the dotted dogs.;    "We've been getting a lot of attention lately," said
Vilma Baquero, an Orlando Dalmatian aficionado, "especially when we walk both
of our Dalmatians. Kids point to us as we go by. We're getting lots of double
takes these days."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Baqueros recently bred their 2-year-old Dalmatian, Jake, with neighbor
Scott Burke's Dalmatian. Coincidentally, the nine puppies were ready for sale
just as the movie came out. Five have been sold.;    For Debra Kellermeier,
who lives in Belleview, Fla., the timing was perfect. Kellermeier's Dalmatian
had her second litter in June and, though Dalmatians typically have six to
eight puppies, Kellermeier found herself with a dozen.;    Desperate, she
persuaded an Ocala movie theater manager to let her put up notices in the
lobby where "101 Dalmatians" was playing.;    "I was grateful for the movie,
frankly," Kellermeier said. "Selling puppies near Christmas is easy, but
trying to sell 12 in July is another thing entirely." So far, she has sold
seven.;    Yet the Dalmatian boomlet didn't begin with the rerelease of the
animated Disney classic in which the adorable puppies of Dalmatians Pongo and
Perdita are abducted by henchmen of the evil Cruella De Vil. And although the
evidence is spotty, it appears that the trend will continue after the movie
closes. Long favorites of firefighters, Dalmatians are making a dash toward
the top of the doggie popularity charts.;    Of the 131 breeds recognized by
the New York-based American Kennel Club, the Dalmatian is now the 19th most
popular breed in the country -- up from 24th in 1989. AKC officials predict
that at this rate, Dalmatians may break into the club's Top 10 during the
1990s.;    "This jump occurred before the movie came out," said AKC spokesman
Wayne Cavanaugh. "In 1990, there were tons of TV commercials featuring
Dalmatians. In fact, Hewlett-Packard pulled theirs, saying it wasn't being
recognized because of 'Dalmatian saturation.' ";    Although dog-watchers are
often at a loss to explain why a breed suddenly skyrockets in popularity,
Cavanaugh thinks fashion may be behind the upward mobility of Dalmatians: They
go so well with the black-and-white fashions in vogue.;    Cavanaugh also
figures that Americans are tiring of guard dogs and are returning to family
dogs. "I hope that since the Dalmatian is such a happy, good-natured family
dog that this bodes well for the '90s," Cavanaugh said, noting that the most
popular canines of the 1950s were Boston terriers ("a wonderful little lap
dog"), beagles and cocker spaniels.;    Cavanaugh credits the revival of "101
Dalmatians" with bringing Dalmatian mania to a head.;    After all, time has
proved that television and movies have a pronounced effect on the public's dog
preferences. Collies rose dramatically in popularity while Lassie was on the
air, and nearly every dog movie since has caused a similar sensation.;
Since "101 Dalmatians" was rereleased in July, the AKC's offices in New York
and North Carolina have been swamped with calls from people looking for
reputable Dalmatian breeders.;    Though not rare, Dalmatians are not as
common as beagles, poodles and golden retrievers -- all breeds that have been
in the AKC's Top 10 during the past decade. Among the estimated 1.2 million
dogs registered with the AKC, there were only 21,000 Dalmatians in 1990.;
Dalmatian owners, as a result, spend much of their leisure time answering
questions from the curious.;    "I walk my dog two miles every night," said
Lisa Moye, a St. Cloud, Fla., resident and Dalmatian owner, "and I can't get
away from people stopping me and asking questions.";    A few years ago, Moye
drove to North Dakota with her dog, Spokes. At every rest stop and gas
station, strangers peppered her with questions.;    "Nobody really understands
the breed," Moye said, "so they have lots of questions.";    Dog historians,
in fact, still debate the origins of Dalmatians. While some believe the
spotted dogs originated in Asia more than 300 years ago, Dalmatians appear in
antique frescoes and paintings from Egypt and Greece. The consensus, however,
holds that the dogs originated in the Middle East and traveled westward with
bands of Gypsies. When the Gypsies settled in Yugoslavia, the dogs became part
of the landscape in and around an area known as Dalmatia.;    Used as
messengers during the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913, the dogs acquired the name
Dalmatians. They were also used as sled dogs, herd dogs and guard dogs.;
But in the 19th century, Dalmatians became popular throughout Europe --
particularly in Britain -- as carriage dogs. Well suited for the work,
Dalmatians are typically good with horses and reportedly could thread their
way through a team of horses without disturbing them. Because of these traits,
the dogs frequently accompanied carriages and were used to guard the carriage
and horses while the owners tended to business.;    It was that trait that led
to Dalmatians' reputation as firehouse dogs. Firefighters of yesteryear needed
a dog that could calm the horses and watch the fire cart while they were
battling blazes.;    Dalmatians are rarely found in fire stations today, but
they remain popular pets for firefighters. At the Altamonte Springs, Fla.,
Fire Department, Cmdr. Bill Baer counts at least a half-dozen Dalmatian owners
among his staff.;    The dogs tend to wind up with fire-related names. There's
Ashes, Smokey and the occasional Ben -- named for Benjamin Franklin, who
founded the nation's first volunteer fire department.;    But among civilian
Dalmatian owners, the names still tend to focus on the spots. There's Spot
(which causes Dalmatian breeders to gag), Dottie, Checkers and the occasional
Freckles.;    But at the American Kennel Club, where dog owners register the
names of their purebreds, spokesman Cavanaugh is willing to bet what the most
popular names will be in the coming months.;    "We'll be overwhelmed with
requests for the name Pongo."  </TEXT>

   Local humane society officials are
pressing for an ordinance to ban all breeding of dogs and cats.
It's not that they are against puppies and kittens, they just want
to stop killing 10,000 unwanted animals each year.
   The debate over the proposed breeding ban is shaping into a
class battle fought by responsible pet owners and breeders of
aristocratic pets, and shelter workers who must euthanize thousands
of those pets' poorer cousins each year.
   ``What is radical is what we've been doing, killing animals,''
said Kim Sturla, executive director of the Peninsula Humane
Society. ``I think it's crazy that it's become acceptable to kill
dogs and cats.''
   Under the proposal, believed to be the first of its kind in the
nation, pet owners found in violation would face fines ranging from
$100 to $500. Penalties would be waived if the animals are spayed
or neutered.
   ``It doesn't seem right. If people allow their animals to roam
outside, then I understand why they should be spayed or neutered,''
said Carolyn Varner of San Mateo County, who is selling two
5-month-old registered Persian kittens for $175 each.
   ``But my cats are indoor cats and they aren't allowed to go
breed every time they go into heat.''
   The proposed ordinance, which would apply to unincorporated
areas in this affluent county of 600,000 south of San Francisco, is
designed to reach zero pet population growth.
   It calls for a one-year moratorium on breeding and then
mandatory spaying and neutering of cats and dogs. Pet stores would
still be allowed to import puppies and kittens, but the animals
would have to be neutered.
   Opponents argue that it is unenforceable. Breeders, they say,
would lose a livelihood and animals spayed and neutered to comply
with the new law would be barred from many competitions.
   San Mateo County Supervisor Tom Nolan, the ordinance's sponsor,
said he expects some details may be modified after public hearings
that begin Tuesday before the county board of supervisors.
   But Nolan says the tragedy of euthanizing thousands of animals a
year ultimately outweighs other concerns.
   ``If you put show and prize animals as one value next to an
ordinance that might potentially save 10,000 dogs or cats a year, I
imagine the choice is clear,'' Nolan said.
   Sturla said there are no large-scale breeders she is aware of in
San Mateo County.
   ``I would challenge anybody to show me anyone making a living
off breeding animals, except `puppy mill'-ers,'' Sturla said.
``We're certainly having an impact on somebody's hobby, but we're
not having an impact on anyone's livelihood.''
   And Nolan said he is less interested in catching every violator
than encouraging pet owners to be responsible.
   ``My hope is that ... there will some kind of social sanctions
attached to the person in the neighborhood who lets their dog or
cat go around without being spayed or neutered,'' he said.
   Of the roughly 15,000 animals brought to the shelter each year,
1,500 are returned to their owners and 3,500 are adopted, according
to Humane Society figures. The remaining 10,000 animals are killed.
   As if the statistics weren't attention-grabbing enough, the
Humane Society recently euthanized several animals in front of
reporters.
   ``We're trying to illustrate to the public that 10,000 is not
just a statistic,'' Sturla said. ``They are living, feeling
animals.''
   The reporters ``experienced what we experience every single day.
They got to see fear on the animal's face, to see the animal
tremble and see her defecate in the hallway on the way to the
kennel,'' Sturla said.
   ``What we're attempting to do is drag the euthanization of dogs
and cats out of the closet,'' Nolan said. ``When you see it, you
understand its a barbaric practice.''

'VERBAL CONTROL' OF PIT BULLS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled to see the photo in the (April 4) Ventura County section showing
a young woman who "playfully swings her pet pit bull, Gypsy" in the parking lot
of the Oxnard airport, as the caption stated.
</P>
<P>
Pit bulls are dangerous dogs, I thought, and to have an animal "known for
powerful jaws and aggressive behavior," as the caption said, run loose at a
public airport parking lot sent shivers up my spine.
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, the lady at the Ventura County Animal Regulation Department told
me. As long as the pit bull, Doberman, German shepherd or whatever breed is
"under the verbal control of the owner," it is perfectly OK to have the animal
unleashed on public property. I was assured that none of the named breeds are
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Do you suppose that the several recent victims of vicious pit bull attacks
would agree with the cavalier interpretation of the animal control regulations?

   Your Feb. 6 article "They Find It's Also Hard to Teach an
Old Dog's Puppies New Tricks" recounts dates that defy
history. Nipper the dog was not "adopted as a mascot by RCA
in 1929," nor was he ever listening to His Master's Voice on
a Victrola. The now-world-famous trademark was created by my
grandfather Emile Berliner (inventor of the microphone, the
disk record and co-founder of Victor Records) in 1900 from an
1899 painting by the British artist Francis Barraud and
depicts an 1896 Berliner gramophone. Victor Records was not
founded until 1901 and the word Victrola didn't appear until
1908; consequently, the dog was never listening to a
Victrola. Four calamities occurred in 1929: RCA acquired
Victor and thus the then-world's most famous trademark; Emile
Berliner died; I was born, and the stock market tumbled.
   General Electric acquired the trademark when it reacquired
RCA, leasing certain use of it to Thomson S.A., of France.
And the reason Thomson's ad agency is having difficulty
getting dogs that resemble Nipper -- and the dogs they do get
have to be used under very limited circumstances -- is that
they're using the wrong dogs. If they'd bother to check,
they'd have learned that Nipper was a bull terrier, a very
common British breed that incorporates the strength and broad
chest of the bulldog with the speed, size and other
characteristics of a terrier.

<TEXT>     "He has an amazing energy level and muscular development," said Gloth.
"He's helped me put in long hours of training. I just float along with him.";
  Gloth knows dogs. He is a veterinarian. He has run as much as 10 miles a day
with Tarzan since the dog was 1 1/2 years old. "He adapted better than a
human," Gloth said. "He didn't find it stressful at all.";    Runners have
always had a love-hate relationship with dogs. Almost every runner has stories
about being chased during workouts by growling dogs, and many runners have
been bitten.;    But a growing number of people enjoy running with their dogs
for company, protection and the benefits of having a speedy training partner.;
   "The question of running with a dog has come up increasingly because people
want protection," said Micky Niego, training director of the ASPCA in
Manhattan. "The answer is, sure, if the dog is physically mature, and you work
him gradually, we recommend it. The worst thing for a dog is to sit around all
day with nothing to do.";    In terms of fitness and training intensity, dogs
are much like humans. They should start out with an easy couple of miles, run
on soft surfaces whenever possible, maintain a healthy diet and be careful in
the heat.;    "Dogs do not sweat," said Brian Kilcommons, president of Family
Dog Inc., a Manhattan canine training facility, and a consultant to the Tufts
University School of Veterinary Medicine.;    "They release their body heat
mainly through panting. If a dog begins to pant heavily and his saliva becomes
viscous, it's a sign to back off.";    Certain breeds are better suited to
running than others. Their suitability is based primarily on size, body type
and the ability to cope with heat.;    Generally, big dogs with long legs and
short coats are strong runners. A heavy coat makes heat dissipation
difficult.;    Retrievers, Labradors, setters, hounds, Dalmatians, pointers
and huskies are among the superior runners.;    Pekingese, dachshunds, Lhasa
apsos, Boston terriers, Yorkies and bulldogs are poor runners. Dogs with short
noses do not have breathing passages geared for distance running.;    "Make
sure the dog has access to fresh water during a run," said Gloth, who runs
near a lake so Tarzan can take a periodic drink.;    Now that Tarzan is
getting older -- he's about 50 in human years -- Gloth has cut the dog's
running to five miles three times a week.;    Age is a more important
consideration when the dog is young and still growing. "I have a 6-month-old
Great Dane puppy who looks like an adult. But his bones are still soft," said
Kilcommons. "I'll wait till he's a year-and-a-half before running with him.";
  That is the age to begin running with a so-called giant breeds, according to
Davia Anne Gallup, author of "Running With Man's Best Friend" (Alpine
Publications, Loveland, Colo., 1986).;    Giant breeds, said Gallup, are dogs
over 100 pounds. She specifies 8 months as a starting point for small breeds
(45 pounds or less), and 1 year for large breeds (46 to 100 pounds).;
Gallup and other experts emphasize that dogs must be obedience-trained before
running.  </TEXT>

   Two boys turned loose a pair of dogs on a
playground full of children, who ran and screamed as the animals
chased them and bit five of the youngsters, police said.
   ``I was playing catch at recess when I heard them yelling, `The
dogs are coming! The dogs are coming!' I climbed up the wall and I
kicked him (a dog) in the face when he started after me,'' said
Edgar Oliveras, a sixth-grader.
   Police searched for the boys who released the dogs Thursday
during recess for about 100 children at the St. Edwards Parochial
School, said Officer George Christman.
   Some victims identified the dogs as pit bulls, but police and a
spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals were unable to identify the breed.
   ``We weren't doing nothing to them. All I know is that they just
let go of the pit bulls,'' said Jerry Lopez, 10.
   He and four others were treated at St. Christopher's Hospital for
Children for wounds on their feet and legs. One of the injured, a
12-year-old who fell while running from a dog, suffered 35 bites and
cuts on his legs and feet.
   The attack ended when two men scared away the dogs.
   Elaine Newton, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania SPCA, said
several people in the neighborhood own pit bulls but that SPCA crews
were unable to find the dogs involved in the attack and were unsure
whether pit bulls were responsible.

We recently put our family cocker spaniel out of his misery -- the poor dog had
developed cataracts and chronic ear infections. Hardly a normal condition for a
dog 6 years old; the vet credits congenital defects due to inbreeding of the
most popular breed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He probably could have been nursed along for another few years on systemic
antibiotics, but there was no guarantee that the quality of his life would have
improved, nor did it seem quite right to spend so much money, given the far
greater needs we have as a society.
</P>
<P>
Next time we get a dog, we'll go to a private breeder, or better yet, adopt
from the pound. These animals so badly need a home, and "mutts" are often
easier to get along with than highly wired pure breeds. We've learned our
lesson, which basically boils down to responsibility on the part of pet
breeders and owners. Too bad people don't take a course in pet care so they
appreciate the full magnitude of the responsibilities and costs before buying
that adorable little thing in the window.

   A man whose two mixed-breed pit
bulls attacked and critically injured his mother is asking the
county to return the animals to him instead of destroying them.
   Terrence Young's dogs, who had bitten other people, were
impounded after they attacked his 76-year-old mother, Anna Young,
on July 5. They are being held at the Broward County Animal Control
shelter.
   Outside Thursday's hearing, Young, of Pompano Beach, said that
people who committed similar crimes were imprisoned, not killed. He
called his pets, named Honey and Bruiser, ``defenseless little
dogs.''
   Al Davis, director of Animal Control and the hearing officer in
the case, said he would decide the matter in 10 days.
   Several witnesses, including a mailman bitten by the dogs,
argued against the dogs' release.
   Deborah Stuck, the paramedic who treated Mrs. Young, described
how the left side of Mrs. Young's neck had been mauled, her breasts
ripped and her legs shredded.
   Richard Collard, executive director of the Humane Society of
Broward County, said the dogs should be put to death or they would
attack again.
   The Youngs' lawyer, Martin Jaffe, contends the county has not
determined that the dogs are vicious. Jaffe said that under county
ordinances, a dog can be impounded only if it attacks someone after
it has been determined to be vicious.
   Mrs. Young was in critical condition Friday at the Northwest
Regional Medical Center. She was taken of life support at the
hosptial shortly after the July 5 accident, but while being
transferred to another hospital her ambulance was struck by a car.
   After the accident, she was again admitted to Northwest in
critical condition.

   The City Council unanimously approved
a law requiring pit bulls to wear muzzles in public, the first of
its kind in the nation.
   The measure, approved Monday, still must be OK'd by provincial
authorities.
   There has been a recent increase in publicity over attacks by
pit bulls, which are becoming very popular in the Netherlands.
Nationwide, there are about 6,000 of the dogs.
   A pit bull terrier killed a horse in the southern city of
Eindhoven this month, and several people have been injured in
recent pit bull attacks.
   Although written with the pit bull terrier in mind, the Gouda
law would order muzzling for ``a breed designated as dangerous (by
the city fathers) or any of its descendants obtained by
cross-breeding.''
   Pit bull owners convicted under the new bylaw would face a
$2,600 fine.

<LEADPARA>  An ordinance mandating that most cats and dogs in Santa Cruz County be
neutered or spayed is being proposed by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.;    The proposed law, similar to one adopted after much
controversy in San Mateo County late last year, would set fines for pet owners
who refuse to sterilize their dogs or cats. It would also exempt professionals
whose pups and kittens are intended for breeding or show purposes.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEUTERING LAW WEIGHED IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     An SPCA official said Thursday that she hoped the law would reduce the
number of dogs and cats put to sleep at the group's shelter near Santa Cruz
each year.;    Last year, said Judy Cassada, SPCA director of education, 5,135
dogs and cats were "put down" at the shelter.;    "Actually," said Cassada,
"the number of animals we've had to put down has been going down each year.
But the number is still enormous.;    "We hope this ordinance would reduce
that number substantially.";    The future of the proposed ordinance, which
would have to be adopted by the board of supervisors, is by no means certain.;
   Although no organized opposition has yet surfaced as it did in San Mateo
County, Cassada predicted that it would arise as the proposed ordinance is
aired.;    Fred Keeley, chairman of the board of supervisors, indicated
Thursday that he was not a supporter of the SPCA proposal.;    "It certainly
has yet to be proven to me that there is need for legislation in that area,"
said Keeley, whose sprawling San Lorenzo Valley-Scotts Valley district
includes rugged mountain areas where dog catchers are about as welcome as
"revenooers" used to be in the illegal white-lightning distilling areas of
Appalachia.;    A slightly different version of a mandate that dogs and cats
be sterilized was approved by San Mateo County supervisors, on a 3-1 vote,
last December. That ordinance drew fire from many pet owners, who complained
that it would restrict breeders while having little long-range effect on the
pet population explosion.;    "It sounds like a wonderful idea at first," said
Betty-Anne Stenmark, an opponent of the San Mateo County ordinance. "But it's
not that simple. You just can't get all the dogs and cats licensed. It just
won't work.";    The SPCA will hold a public meeting on the ordinance at 7
p.m. Tuesday at Green Acres School, 966 Bostwick Lane, Santa Cruz. Then, said
Cassada, the proposal will be forwarded to county officials for their
consideration.;    Soquel dog breeder Tom Markey, whose family has been
raising and selling Boston terriers at Byrmar Kennels for more than four
decades, said Thursday he was not opposed to the proposal. He noted that as a
professional breeder he would be exempted from its provisions.;    In fact, he
said, there were probably some advantages to the ordinance.;    "There are
people," he said, "who let their male dogs run loose and hook up with every
bitch in town."  </TEXT>

   I guess it would have detracted from the otherwise wryly
humorous tone of Pamela Sebastian's interesting article "OK,
What Rhymes With Vogue and Eats Raw Chicken Necks?" (page
one, April 23), but there was little discussion of what
becomes of dogs no longer seen as trendy (or that become too
big or aggressive), or that come out of puppy mills with many
handicaps and wind up being given up to animal shelters as
excess baggage and, if not adopted soon, killed. There is
already a severe overpopulation of dogs and cats, with
thousands put to death by euthanasia daily, yet some people
encourage more breeding in order to seem chic. I guess it
wouldn't be trendy to adopt a pet from a shelter (and so save
its life) or, perish the thought, actually watch what happens
to the no-longer-trendy-or-convenient animals put in pounds
or shelters.

inferior, indolent breeds of dogs.
   Squire is bright, intelligent, loyal and as good a

necks." He doesn't just eat and sleep as does Mr. Dogue de
Bordeaux. He is a loving friend.
   When I awoke this day, he was in a foul mood. When I
questioned him, he told me about Ms. Sebastian's reference to
the "in pets," a la Akita pups or a fox-faced "shiba inu",
the "bichon frise" plus the AKC's so-called top 10 breeds.
   Squire, who is 10 years old, is sitting beside me as I

him a biscuit, and now there is peace in this domicile.

   In mentioning the "gripping dog" of the Canary Islands,
your article on "power dogs" provided an unexpected
etymological treat. After all, the Canary Islands were named
for the canines roaming wild there. (The bird was named for
its island home, not vice versa.) Having read the article, I
pondered the fact that the Greek word for dog is the root of
"cynosure" and "cynicism."

   The nation's first ban on pet
breeding has become law, and owners of show animals promise a
dogfight to overturn it.
   San Mateo County's breeding ban, which requires that most pets
be spayed or neutered, received final approval Tuesday.
   Opponents campaigned for a last-minute reversal before the Board
of Supervisors voted 3-1 in favor of the law designed to reduce the
number of strays put to death in the county just south of San
Francisco.
   Under the law, breeders who obtain permits would be able to
continue furthering bloodlines, but that's not enough for some show
dog owners.
   ``The whole thing is going to end up an enormous legal battle,''
said Susan Clough of Redwood City, a show dog owner picketing with
her dog Loree.
   ``The intent was never to go after any group of people but to
rectify an untenable situation in which we kill 10,000 pets a
year,'' said Supervisor Tom Nolan, author of the measure.
   The ordinance bans breeding by private dog and cat owners for
six months starting in July. By 1992, only dogs and cats owned by
professional and hobby breeders holding permits will be allowed to
reproduce.
   All other cats and dogs will have to be spayed or neutered.
   Violators face a $500 fine. The cost of the permit and other
details have not been worked out.
   The ordinance affects only unincorporated areas amounting to
about 10 percent of the county's population of 628,000. It would
not affect such cities as South San Francisco, Redwood City, San
Mateo and Menlo Park.

   It was to have been a bright spot in the Dallas Apparel
Mart's spring fashion show: A model in leather and polka dots
walking down the runway next to a Dalmatian with more or less
the same look.
   But fashion turned quickly to farce when the dog spotted
its owner in the crowd and lurched on its leash, yanking the
young woman off her high heels. "It pulled that poor 90-pound
model nearly to the floor," recalls Chere Hickock of the
Animal Trackers talent agency, which provided the dog.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's how it is with Dalmatians, an ill-mannered breed if
ever there was one. But the dogs' graceful good looks have
made them stars of page and screen. Dalmatians appear in ads
for Sears and Hewlett-Packard, J.C. Penney and Citicorp. One
was on the cover of HG (House &amp; Garden). And they are
enjoying the sort of surge in popularity among dog owners
that happened when Snoopy caused a run on beagles.
   Unfortunately, as many new owners are discovering,
Dalmatians can be unruly. Bred as coach dogs (another name
for the breed), and associated with firefighters, Dalmatians
frequently prove too rambunctious for house and apartment.
They were born to run. Thanks to the gene pool, a quarter of
the dogs also are deaf in one ear. (A wag might say that's
why they obey only half the time.) And they urinate
particularly high-proof uric acid, guaranteed to kill any
lawn.
   "Dalmatians are too much dog for most people," says Bob
Maida, who trained Nancy Reagan's bouvier des Flandres puppy,
Lucky.
   That doesn't stop people from buying Dalmatians. According
to the American Kennel Club Inc., annual registration more
than doubled from 1986 to 1990, to 21,603, making the
Dalmatian the 19th-most-popular breed and the fastest-growing
breed in the U.S.
   The registration numbers most likely understate the
breed's presence. When a pup is born with a black patch
covering an eye or ear, breeders who care will either drown
(or "bucket") the dog or give it away unregistered.
Dalmatians sometimes have litters of 10 or 15 and not enough
teats to feed them all. Totally deaf Dalmatians (about 7% of
the breed) are usually destroyed in their first weeks of
life.
   Many who have paid the price (often $200 to $500) for a
supposedly flawless Dalmatian probably wish they had bought,
say, a wild boar instead. Take Christine Sylvester, a
substitute teacher in San Jose, Calif., who bought one of the
dogs after taking her two children to see the Disney movie
"101 Dalmatians."
   Instead of the "ideal family dog" described in a dog book,
Ms. Sylvester says the new pet, Abbey, terrorized her kids by
pogoing around and nipping at them in play. "My daughter
would crouch on the floor like she was preparing for an air
raid," Ms. Sylvester said.
   Once, when her seven-year-old son didn't assume the
position, Abbey snagged him on the top of the ear with a
sharp tooth and nearly ripped it off. The boy needed 12
stitches and plastic surgery. (Abbey was impounded for a time
but eventually found a home where there were no children.)
   Stan Tiner, public affairs director for Arkla Inc., in
Shreveport, La., bought a Dalmatian for its sleek lines and
long, pointed tail. Mr. Tiner pictured a warm Christmas scene
with his family cooing over the pup he named Winston. But
after Winston chewed every shoe in the house, dug up the
garden and broke a lamp, "I think I'm the only human left who
likes him," Mr. Tiner says.
   Of course, not all Dalmatians generate horror stories.
Dalmatian lovers abound, at least in history books, from
George Washington to Adlai Stevenson. Today's most prominent
Dalmatian fanatic probably is Deal-a-Meal diet guru Richard
Simmons, who owns six but doesn't want to be interviewed
about them.
   Still, the dogs' sudden popularity puzzles even some of
their longtime fans. "They're the flavor of the week, and I
don't know why," says dog writer Esmeralda Treen, co-author
of the seminal work "The Dalmatian: Coach Dog-Firehouse Dog."
   Breeders guess that people have been drawn to Dalmatians
because of the graphics-oriented fashion scene of recent
years -- and all those polka dots. Also, those who have given
the matter some thought suggest that the drumbeat of
Dalmatians in advertising probably sells dogs even as it
moves laser printers.
   If art directors are to blame for selling pet owners on
difficult dogs, they have subjected themselves to some
punishment too. Persuading these fidgety beasts to sit, much
less pose, can put spots before your eyes.
   If many dog breeds achieve the show-biz equivalent of a
Ph.D. in behavior, Dalmatians are usually dropouts. Ms.
Hickock, the animal trainer, remembers shooting one print ad
in which the dog simply refused to look at the camera. For a
full day, she says, she waved her hands, raw meat and
whatever else was handy, while the photographer did a slow
burn. Only when she waved her newborn baby did the animal
finally take notice. "I have a sleepless night before I work
with Dalmatians," she says.
   Rob Ingalls, West Coast creative director for Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi DFS/Pacific ad agency, recalls that the 30-second
television spot for Hewlett-Packard Co.'s laser printer
required four frustrating days and 96 takes.
   Charlie, the HP TV spokesdog, is one of the best-trained
Dalmatians on the circuit, with credits that include a role
in the Francis Ford Coppola film "Tucker: The Man and His
Dream." But even he had a hard time learning to walk, run,
stop, look at the computer printer and then at the camera,
says Mr. Ingalls. Charlie's understudy on the HP set is more
typical -- he wouldn't obey a single command.
   Few blame Dalmatian misbehavior on stupidity. The
suspicion is that the dogs understand commands well enough.
It's just that Dalmatians would rather have back their old
jobs as marathon pace dogs. Modeling is not their thing. And
small children are to bite.
   "Of all the dogs we use," says Bill Lunsford, creative
director for Alpo's ad agency in Philadelphia, The Weightman
Group, "the Dalmatians are never quick to give the affection
shots we need."

   Museum Puts on the Dog

   St. Louis -- For one recent brisk afternoon the Dog Museum
here could claim a clumber spaniel. Then we piled Annie in
our car, headed back to Kentucky, and left the museum bereft
of the breed. Clumbers are not the only thing of which the
Dog Museum is bereft: the list includes kuvaszok (except for
the one on a pewter key ring in the gift shop), proper
labeling and available guides (human, written or audio). It
is, after all, just a pup of a museum, but a pup of superb
configuration and great promise. Given time and the right
diet ($), it very likely will develop into a champion.
   Devoted to the collection, preservation and exhibition of
works of art and literature related to "canis familiaris",
the Dog Museum first opened in New York in 1982. In 1987 it
moved into Jarville House, a magnificent Greek Revival
building in Queeny Park, 25 miles west of downtown St. Louis,
and invited people and dogs inside for a look. Last fall the
museum opened a grand, well-lighted, air-conditioned,
beautifully decorated addition. (Paid for in most part by
$1.2 million from county funds -- a government expense that
did not go unnoticed by editors, writers of letters to the
editor, cartoonists and voters during last fall's county
election.) The expansion and refurbishment involved new
carpet, which, alas, brought on new rules. Annie could not
get past the front door of Jarville House. Four magnificent
black cast -- concrete retrievers and a fantastic carousel
dog guard the entry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This deprivation did not offend Annie, whose perception of
culture extends only inches past her nose. There are about
200,000 dogs in St. Louis County, and a good many of them
apparently have visited Queeny Park. While Annie sniffed
their vestiges outside we looked inside.
   The largest individual art collection given to the museum
so far came from the estate of Marie Moore, a Virginian who
majored in mastiffs. In oil (including Richard Ansdell's "The
Poacher"), watercolor and bronze, as well as on hat pins and
earrings, her mastiffs are the cornerstone of the museum's
holdings.
   Since Ms. Moore's initial gift, there have been several
other good-sized collections donated, as well as individual
gifts, so there is a somewhat diverse representation of
breeds. The main exhibition room displays schipperkes,
pointers, whippets, a bull terrier, coonhounds and others
along with a collection of figurines by Amory C. Simons
donated by the American Museum of Natural History.
   Those products of the no man's land between art and
science exemplify one of the major goals of this museum: to
acquire dog collections before they get dispersed or ditched.
   The most spectacular pieces currently on exhibit are a
pair of pointer paintings by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, an
18th-century French artist. My enchantment with Oudry's
pointers may have been influenced by the fact that one of
them looks a lot like a pointer I once knew. I felt the same
attachment to some wonderful bronze coonhounds, but then, my
dogs have always been hunters.
   The museum's collection is heavy with 19th-century English
dog art, a reflection of the English Victorians' urge to own
dogs and pay painters to immortalize them. Collectors today
may expect to pay from $2,000 to $70,000 or more for such
paintings, according to William Secord, who put together the
initial Dog Museum collection when he was curator during its
time in New York. (Mr. Secord now specializes in dog art at
his New York gallery, at 52 East 76th St., where he recently
opened a new exhibit, "British Dog Painting, 1840-1940.")
   A big chunk of the Dog Museum's collection is in storage
until April while "Snoopy, the Universal Dog" fills the
galleries of the new building. Even non-beagle people tend to
think of Snoopy as MY dog, and his stint at the museum has
garnered good publicity. A more extensive and diverse
exposure of the permanent collection will give the museum a
chance to expound on the unique place man's best friend has
in art and history. In the meantime, the museum's collection
of dog literature, both antique and current, is available for
browsing.
   The new building includes a tile-floored community room
where dogs (well-behaved and with their human in tow) are
allowed. Annie joined us there to look at some contemporary
dog art, including a poignant photograph of a mutt (a breed
scarce in dog art) and works by members of the museum's
registry of dog artists (who will happily paint, sketch,
watercolor, draw or sculpt your dog; the museum does not
quote prices).
   Later, while Annie snored, we watched an 18-minute
American Kennel Club tape about the clumber spaniel's proper
configuration (Annie lacks a bit in this department -- she's
merely a "pet quality" clumber) and sterling qualities
("dignified" and "enthusiastic" -- no mention of digging or
snoring or shedding). The museum's extensive tape library
includes a complete set of AKC breed tapes plus a goodly
selection of how-to's and documentaries.
   Each Sunday afternoon the museum sponsors show-and-tell in
the community room, usually focusing on lesser-known breeds
or pet care. February's schedule includes the Bedlington and
Norwich terriers and the Havanese.
   When I told a dog-nut friend of mine who lives in New
Jersey that I was going to visit the Dog Museum in St. Louis
she said, "Oh, it's such a pity they put it out there where
no one can see it." The St. Louis tourist bureau people would
like for my friend to know that one-third of this nation's
residents (who own, presumably, one-third of the nation's
54.5 million dogs) live within a day's drive of St. Louis.
More and more visit every day, leaving their, er, mark on the
place. Annie may not be able to stand the excitement of a
second trip.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Pit Bull Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first case of its kind, the owner
of a pit bull dog went on trial Monday in the murder of a toddler
mauled after wandering into the dog's path while, prosecutors say,
it was guarding 243 marijuana plants.
   Jury selection began in Santa Clara County Superior Court for
Michael Berry, 39, of Morgan Hill. Berry is charged with
second-degree murder for the June 13, 1987, death of his 2-year-old
neighbor, James Soto, who died of severe blood loss after being
attacked by the Berry's pit bull named Willy.
   Berry also faces felony marijuana cultivation charges.
   According to the prosecutor and the Humane Society of the United
States, the trial marks the first time in this country that a pet
owner has been charged with murder because of an animal's actions.
   Deputy District Attorney Dale Sanderson acknowledged there is no
evidence of malice or intent to kill young Soto, but said the
prosecution is based on the theory of implied malice. That allows a
murder conviction for someone whose actions show wanton disregard
for human life.
   ``What we have is a guy who raises a dog that is bred for
aggressiveness and to be a combatant,'' Sanderson said during
Berry's arraignment two years ago. ``And, knowing the dog's
propensity, he places him in an area accessible to all _ including
children.''
   During a search of Berry's home, authorities said they found
several publications on illegal dog fighting, and a dog-sized
conditioning treadmill.
   A gag order was issued last month, barring both sides from
discussing the case.
   James Soto's father, Arthur, said he and his wife had left James
playing with new toy trucks on their back patio while they went
shopping at garage sales. When they returned, the father said he
found their son being ``torn apart'' by the pit bull after
apparently wandering through an open gate and into the unfenced
yard of their neighbor. The child never regained consciousness.
   At least 157 people have died from dog attacks nationwide in the
past 10 years, 70 percent of them under the age of 10, according to
the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   But of those cases, the Humane Society of the United States said
only one owner has been convicted of a major felony. Hayward
Turnipseed of De Kalb County, Ga., was convicted of involuntary
manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison after three of
his pit bulls killed a 4-year-old boy in 1987.
   Berry has contended that he has been singled out because his dog
attacked a child at a time when the breed was the center of
considerable negative publicity.
   ``I think a murder rap is overdoing it by a lot,'' said Sanford
Kadish, a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``If this is the highest form of crime, then what do we
do with the hired killer or the serial rapist?''
   Kadish and other lega experts have speculated that Berry was
charged with second-degree murder in an effort to force him to
plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter instead.
   Berry faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.
   While Berry goes on trial, his dog, Willy, remains at the Santa
Clara animal shelter.
   He has not been destroyed because he is considered evidence in
the case, and he is described as a friendly and affectionate dog.
But shelter spokeswoman Stacy Hill said Willy nevertheless will be
destroyed at the conclusion of the legal battle.

<TEXT>
   The city is getting tough on the pugnacious pit
bull dog, barring the breed from taking up future residence and
requiring photos and tattoos of those already here.
   The Board of Health adopted a Health Code amendment Monday that
requires that all pit bull terriers be registered, spayed or
neutered and identified by photographs and tattooing.
   The regulations, which go into effect in 30 days, also require
that the animals be muzzled whenever there is any potential contact
with the public, that they be on a leash when outside the owner's
home and that signs be posted on the premises indicating the
presence of a pit bull.
   The terriers, which were long ago bred to battle bulls for
sport, have been known to turn on humans without warning and bite
or maul them.
   Registration of all pit bulls with the city Department of Health
must take place before Oct. 1, and owners must have proof of
liability insurance of at least $100,000.
   Unregistered pit bulls can be seized and owners face fines of up
to $500 a day, said department spokesman Barry Adkins.
   ``After October first,'' he said, ``there will be no pit bulls
allowed into New York City. ... Eventually, there will come a time
when there will be no pit bulls in New York City.''
   Adkins said the only figures he had available on deaths from dog
attacks indicated that from 1983 to August 1987, there were 29
deaths nationally and 21 of those were caused by pit bulls.

<MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A  You must be referring to the commercials featuring the white dog and puppy
watching television. The modern version of RCA's Nipper and his puppy
companion are different breeds of terrier. The older dog is a mixed-breed
terrier, says James Harper, spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics, which
markets RCA appliances in America. The perky puppy in the commercial actually
is a composite of several puppies -- all Jack Russell terriers, about 2 months
old. Whether they make good pets, we'll leave up to you and animal experts.
But "they have a personality like you wouldn't believe," says Harper, who adds
that the puppies are very lively and energetic. Incidentally, a fox terrier
was used as the model for the original Nipper. But according to a New York
Times article, years of breeding had significantly changed fox terriers'
appearances, so the advertising agency found an animal trainer with a dog
whose appearance filled the bill. According to "Symbols of America," by Hal
Morgan, the original Nipper was born in Bristol, England, and owned by the
brother of a French landscape painter. After his brother died, the artist,
Francis Barraud, inherited the dog and was amused to see how Nipper put his
ear to the gramophone horn whenever a recording of his original master's voice
was played. Sometime in the 1890s Barraud painted the dog in that pose,
titling the picture "His Master's Voice." He eventually sold it to the
Gramophone Co. after repainting the gramophone as a record player at the
company's request. Nipper died in 1895, but his painting came to America in
1901 as the trademark of the Victor Talking Machine Co. and moved to RCA in
1929 when it acquired Victor.; NO ONE'S GETTING YOUNGER; Q  In March 1990, I

establishment that sells Icees, says Mike McIntyre, general manager of the AMC
Theaters. He says the theater doesn't sell Icees or you could have redeemed it

deceptive. He says it was just one of many free coupons handed out this summer
to adults entering the theater. For example, he says the latest coupon is for
free popcorn and can be redeemed at the AMC refreshment stand.; TIP: FINDING A

<HEAD>Northern California Community Approves Law to Prevent Dog, Cat
Litters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with too many stray dogs and
cats, San Mateo County officials have tentatively approved the
nation's first law that requires nearly all pets to be neutered to
prevent unplanned litters.
   The ordinance approved Tuesday night would impose a moratorium
on all breeding by private dog and cat owners for six months
beginning in July.
   After Jan. 1, 1992, only dogs and cats owned by professional and
hobbyist breeders who hold special permits would be allowed to
reproduce. All other cats and dogs in unincorporated areas of the
county 15 miles south of San Francisco would have to be neutered.
   ``We're very, very pleased. We definitely made history tonight
and we hope (others) will follow suit around the country,'' said
Sherry Richert, spokeswoman for the Peninsula Humane Society.
   Supervisor Tom Nolan, who wrote the ordinance, agreed: ``We took
an historic first step ... toward solving the animal overpopulation
problem.''
   Nolan introduced the measure in October after learning the
humane society kills 10,000 strays each year.
   If approved on final reading next Tuesday, the ordinance will
become law, setting up a committee to set the specific rules and
fees for licensing professional and hobby breeders. Violators would
be fined $500.
   Angry pet owners, including professional and amateur breeders,
have threatened to sue if the law passes.
   ``It's going to be heavily litigated,'' predicted Mark Rudy, a
lawyer representing local dog breeders.
   ``Our canine defense fund has $350,000 in it and we will use
it,'' said Betty-Anne Stenmark, a member of Responsible Dog
Breeders of San Mateo County.
   ``A (breeding) moratorium is blackmail,'' added J. Alan Stern,
spokesman for the American Kennel Club. He urged the board to seek
other means of solving the problem and called for more education
and tougher leash laws.
   The board approved the ban 4-1 after a four-hour hearing that
drew breeders from as far away as Washington, D.C. Among those who
spoke in favor of the measure was singer Grace Slick of the
Jefferson Starship, an animal rights activist who lives in Marin
County north of San Francisco.
   ``We're users, the human race. One of the things we use the most
are the animals,'' Slick said.
   Outside, one of about 50 demonstrators against the ordinance
carried a sign reading: ``If the Humane Society had been in
Hollywood, there would be no Lassie.''

The American Kennel Club has certified thousands of dogs across the country
that investigators contend were fraudulently registered and others whose
pedigrees are uncertain, according to a newspaper report. "The breeders and the
pet stores all know the AKC papers are a joke, but they make their livelihood
on it," Robert Baker, a veteran investigator with the Humane Society of the
United States, told the San Jose Mercury News.

Club officials said the organization routinely accepts a dog owner's word that
an animal is a purebred and does little to verify the applications for the 1.3
million dogs it registers each year. "Basically, the whole system is based on
trust; let's face it," said AKC President Kenneth Marden. The AKC has never
said registering a dog guarantees its breeding, he said, although the public
generally believes that to be true.
