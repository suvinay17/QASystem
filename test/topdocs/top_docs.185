   ``Suddenly there came a tapping, as of
someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.'' Yo.
   Edgar Allan Poe, meet Sylvester Stallone.
   Stallone took a detour during filming of ``Rocky V'' to visit
the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site, a house where the poet
and short-story writer lived for two years.
   Park ranger Joelle Wagner said Thursday she answered a knock at
the locked front door Feb. 12 to find the creator of movie hero
Rocky Balboa on the doorstep with co-star Talia Shire and a
bodyguard.
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' she said. ``I had to take a few moments
to compose myself.''
   As the group toured the three-story structure, one of four
houses Poe rented while living in Philadelphia from 1838 to 1844,
Stallone told Ms. Wagner he had written a movie script about the
author of the poem ``The Raven.''
   ``He's just in awe of Poe,'' Ms. Wagner said. ``He said he
really admired him.''
   Stallone, the lead in such action movies as ``Rambo'' and
``Tango and Cash,'' did not say if he wanted to portray Poe, she
said.
   Ms. Wagner said the trio viewed the park's slide show, which
describes Poe's life from his childhood in Richmond, Va., his time
at West Point and his literary life in Philadelphia, where he was
most successful as a poet, short-story writer, literary critic and
editor.
   Poe died in 1849 in Baltimore as he was traveling to New York.
Stories at the time said he collapsed in the street of an alcohol
or drug overdose.
   While touring the house, Stallone discussed Poe's life and
literary works with his friends, according to Ms. Wagner.
   ``There wasn't much I could tell him'' about Poe, the park
ranger said.
   She said Stallone bought a book on the writer.
   Movie publicist Dave Fulton said Stallone wrote the script
because he believes the writer ``gets within the soul'' of people
and poetry.
   ``He's a big fan,'' Fulton said.
   Poe also wrote ``The Fall of the House of Usher,'' ``The Black
Cat,'' and ``The Murders of the Rue Morgue,'' which established the
mystery or detective short-story form.

<TEXT>
   One of the six Philadelphia homes of author
and poet Edgar Allan Poe was designated a National Literary
Landmark on Sunday because of its importance in the writer's career.
   Jeff Collins, acting supervisory ranger at the Edgar Allan Poe
National Historic Site, said the house is the only one remaining of
Poe's houses in Philadelphia, where he lived from 1838 to 1844.
   Poe's time in Philadelphia is considered among his most
productive, Collins said. ``Most of his famous works were published
here,'' he said.
   They included ``The Tell-Tale Heart,'' ``The Murders in the Rue
Morgue,'' ``The Gold Bug,'' ``The Pit and the Pendulum,'' and ``The
Black Cat,'' said Collins. However, it is not known whether Poe
actually composed those works while living in Philadelphia because
his manuscripts weren't dated.
   The historical site, which became part of Independence National
Historical Park in 1981, includes the house he rented and a
neighbor's house.
   The Literary Landmarks Association is a Columbus, Ohio-based
group that designates sites important to the lives of famous
authors.
   Poe was born in Boston in 1809 and died in Baltimore in 1849.

   A mysterious man dressed in black left a half
bottle of cognac and three roses on Edgar Allan Poe's grave early
today in a ritual that for 41 years has marked the horror writer's
birthday.
   ``Tonight at 3 a.m., six of us inside Westminster Hall spotted a
man dressed in black with a white scarf walk into the grave yard
and place the cognac and roses on the grave,'' said Jeff Jerome,
curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House. ``Some saw a man with white
hair and others didn't.''
   The gifts first were left on Poe's grave at Westminster Hall in
1949, the 100th anniversary of his death, said Jerome, 40.
   There is some argument as to whether the same man has been
responsible for leaving the gift for the entire 41 years, or
whether there has been a succession of grave decorators. Stopping
the man to find out would be out of the question, Jerome said.
   ``First of all, that would be an invasion of privacy,'' he said.
``It's none of our business .. if we interfered, it would ruin it.''
   The man in black leaves a rose for each grave; the bodies of
Poe's wife, Virginia, who died at 25 of tuberculosis, and his aunt,
Maria Poe Clemm, are buried beside the writer.
   Among Poe's most well-known stories are ``The Pit and the
Pendulum,'' and ``The Fall of the House of Usher,'' as well as the
poem ``The Raven.''

   A rare first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's first
book, a collection of poetry written when he was 14, is to be
auctioned by Sotheby's, which calls it ``the most exciting book
discovery in many years.''
   In the 161 years since its publication, only 11 other copies of
``Tamerlane and Other Poems'' have been found. Published in 1827 by
an obscure Boston printer when the poet, short story writer and
critic was 18, it could bring as much as $300,000 at auction on
June 7.
   This 12th copy of the book was discovered in a bin of early
20th-century pamphlets on fertilizers and farming machines by a
Massachusetts book collector while he browsed at an antique barn in
New Hampshire. The price was $15.
   Recognizing the title from an article he had once read, the
collector contacted Sotheby's for an inspection and appraisal.
   ``It was quite a thrill,'' said Jay Dillon, an assistant vice
president in Sotheby's Rare Books Department. ``God, it was
thrilling. ... Here's a fabulous rarity, famous to anyone who's
ever taken more than two courses in American literature.''
   The Massachusetts man, who collects books on local history, said
he suspected it might be an original when he found it, though he
wasn't sure. He had the book only one night before turning it over
to Sotheby's.
   ``I knew I had found something great, a piece of Americana
...,'' said the man, who spoke in a telephone interview on
condition of anonymity. ``I knew it was valuable but never dreamed
that it would mean this much money.''
   ``Actually, I didn't handle it real carefully when I first got
it,'' he said. ``I thumbed through it. ... I never read anything by
Poe in my life. I really don't know too much about books.''
   Poe, who was born in Boston in 1809, orphaned when he was 11 and
raised in Richmond, Va., had the volume published during a short
visit to Boston.
   The literary importance of the 40-page book, which names the
author only as ``A Bostonian,'' is considered negligible; rather,
the work's value has to do with the fact that it's the first work
of one of America's greatest writers and a limited number of copies
were printed.
   How many were printed?
   ``One can guess, but they are all wild,'' Dillon said. ``I think
the range would be from 50 to 250. I would be amazed if more than
500 were printed.''
   The softbound book has its original, tea-colored paper wrappers
and is in unrestored condition. ``The wrappers are frayed, as one
would expect in a 161-year-old pamphlet,'' Dillon said. ``There's
also a light stain on the front cover running through first few
pages.
   ``But the condition of a book like this is not a matter of great
importance among connoisseurs. The question with this book is how
can you get one at all. I would prefer it to be in better
condition. ... I also would prefer to have Poe's signature on it.''
   Nine of the other copies are in public institutions, one is
owned privately and the other's whereabouts is unknown, Dillon said.
   The first copy didn't surface until 1859 when an antiquarian
bookseller in Boston sent it along with a consignment of books to
an agent in London who promptly snatched it up for the British
Museum. A second copy turned up 23 years later in a bookshop's
sidewalk box. It cost 15 cents and later sold at auction in 1892
for $1,850.
   Other copies have surfaced over the years through collections
and dealers. The 11th copy was discovered in 1954 and was auctioned
by Sotheby's in 1974 for $123,000.
   The poems included in the book are ``Tamerlane'' and a group Poe
called ``The Fugitive Pieces.'' They are: ``To ---,'' ``Dreams,''
``Visit of the Dead,'' ``Evening Star'' (never again printed),
``Imitation,'' ``Stanzas,'' ``Poem,'' ``A Wilder'd Being,'' ``The
Happiest Day'' and ``The Lake.''
   The adolescent collection was not exactly the literary hit of
the day. One critic noted: ``A book the critics read without
praising, and the ladies praised without reading.''
   However, the complex and tortured artist was vindicated in later
years through his sinister and compelling stories such as ``The Pit
and the Pendulum'' and ``The Masque of the Red Death,'' and his
musical and sensuous poems such as ``Annabel Lee'' and ``The
Raven.''
   He published two other volumes of poetry after ``Tamerlane,'' in
1829 and 1831. Poe died in 1849.

   A Sorrowful Master of the Macabre

   The sad facts of Edgar Allen Poe's life seem unremarkable
(in terms of tragedy or even weirdness) when compared with
the lives routinely paraded before us by Oprah or Phil or
Sally Jesse. The master teller of Gothic tales didn't claim
to be the product of satanic rape, or incest or any one of
the other horrors that have become staples of confessional
afternoon television.
   The sorrow that lay behind an extraordinary body of
literature of the macabre ("The Pit and the Pendulum," "The
Murders in the Rue Morgue," "The Raven") was "ordinary" by
today's sensationalist standards. Poe's mother died before he
turned three, after his father had already abandoned the
family. The writer's own brief life was a perpetual struggle
for money, recognition and against alcoholism. The most
potentially scandalous thing about it was his decision to
marry his cousin Virginia when she was only 13 (but no
scandal erupted).

   So as a character Poe was intriguing, but hardly
larger-than-life. But his childhood loss, his childish
marriage and his lifelong preoccupation with death have
continued to be of interest for almost two centuries because
of the sustained, morbid power of his poetry and prose. Now
literary historian Kenneth Silverman has illuminated the
relationship between Poe's life and art with a blend of
scholarly and biographical detail as well as Freudian insight
in a fascinating new book, "Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and
Never-ending Remembrance" (HarperCollins, 564 pages, $27.50).
   Mr. Silverman, a serious researcher and writer whose other
books have included a biography of Cotton Mather, clearly
doesn't want to be taken as a pop psycho-biographer. "This
biography is not an argument but a narrative," he writes, and
"no attempt will be made to `prove' that the psychoanalytic
prototype of the bereaved child applies to {Poe}." But he
also recognizes that the heart of Poe's work and its
continuing appeal lies in a lifelong preoccupation with his
mother's death, that this "prolonged mourning, an artistic
brooding-on" motivated the artist's fantasy life. Mr.
Silverman is, after all, chronicling the life of the man who
wrote: "I could not love except where Death/Was mingling his
with Beauty's breath. . . ."
   Edgar Poe was born in 1809 to itinerant parents. His
mother Eliza, an orphan, was a well-thought of actress who
played the East Coast circuit. His father David, son of a
somewhat prominent Baltimore family, wasn't successful
onstage or off; after he abandoned Eliza and their two young
sons, he was never heard from again. More than a year later,
Mrs. Poe gave birth to a third child, a daughter, and then
died at the age of 24.
   Edgar wound up in the care of John Allan, a merchant from
Richmond, Va., and his wife Frances. Their only connection to
him was their love of theater, and their desire for a child.
But their generosity was complicated by John Allan's
ambivalence. He was a self-made man who scorned dependence,
which put his ward Edgar -- a dependent by definition -- in a
difficult position. He was desperate to find a replacement
for the mother he'd lost, but the people who stepped in to
care for him would always keep him at a distance, even
refusing to officially adopt him.
   So Edgar repeatedly sought to annoy John Allan in all ways
possible. Eventually their only communications were through
Edgar's repeated attempts to wheedle money from Allan, to pay
the debts he repeatedly incurred. It seems that even Edgar's
literary drive was fueled by John Allan's disdain of
literature. At the very least, Mr. Silverman observes, Allan
proved to be a rich resource for his ward's fiction, the
model for more than one of Poe's unsympathetic characters.
   Edgar, a bright child who would never satisfy the yearning
left by his mother's death, turned to the world for the
solace he couldn't find at home (Frances Allan, though kind
to him, was sickly). His large ambition announced itself
early on, when as a young teenager he urged his teachers to
publish his poetry. He was obsessed with early success, and
was willing to lie and plagiarize to advance his own
interests.
   As Mr. Silverman chronicles Poe's struggle to establish
himself as a writer, he brings to life the intellectual world
of 19th century America. Poe set out to present himself as a
literary enfant terrible and he chose the right time to do
it. Mr. Silverman describes the years 1825-1850 as the
"golden age of periodicals," a time when 4,000 to 5,000 new
publications came into being.
   With no competition from radio or television or movies, a
brilliant writer of dark melodrama such as Poe could become a
celebrity. And he worked at it, both in his fiction and in
his provocative literary criticism. But his renown didn't
translate into financial success. He died -- at the age of 40
-- as he was born, in poverty.
   One would like to know more about Edgar's life with the
sickly young Virginia (Mr. Silverman hints that the marriage
was never -- or barely -- consummated). But the book does
full justice to the most prominent character in the writer's
life -- his work.

EDGAR A. POE: MOURNFUL AND NEVER-ENDING REMEMBRANCE by Kenneth Silverman
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 25, 564 pages
'EA POE - Ho] Ho] Ho] . .' chanted Noel Coward to roars of laughter from his
Las Vegas audience. Poe was teased about his name in his lifetime too. This
is one of the few glimmerings of humour in Kenneth Silverman's new
biography. It clears up many misconceptions about, and is the fruit of years
of research into, Poe's sad strange life. Name apart, there can never have
been less cause for mirth in the life of a writer.
Tragedy struck in Poe's infancy and rarely let him be till he died at the
age of 40 in 1849. His mother Eliza Poe was a leading lady in a provincial
touring company. She had great success playing Shakespearean heroines in
places as far apart as Boston, Mass. and Richmond, Virginia. Poe was her
darling. His father, David Poe, as poor an actor as his wife was starry,
absconded one day never to be heard of again. In 1811 Eliza contracted a
fever and by the end of the year she was dead. Poe was only three.
John Allan was a dour Scottish immigrant to America, a partner in a then
flourishing tobacco-exporting business. He and his wife were keen
theatre-goers. They had admired Mrs Poe and they took responsibility for her
boy - hence his middle name - without formally adopting him. Like that other
successful story-teller, Somerset Maugham, the young Poe was an orphan
transplanted to an environment from which he soon felt alienated and which
he was determined on becoming adult to put permanently behind him.
Precociously clever and brilliantly imaginative, he began at an early age to
compensate by concocting poetic fantasies. By the age of 20 he had published
a slim volume of dreamy romantic poetry; like his later, more celebrated,
verse this early stuff contains an intense longing for an earthly paradise,
a preoccupation with death and the return to life of the dead.
Poe's turbulent youth, and ever-worsening relations with Allan, particularly
when trying to sponge off him, are well described by Silverman. They follow
a pattern of Poe's failure to sustain any form of work or training outside
his writing. His career at the University of Virginia came to an abrupt end
in a pile of unpaid gambling debts. Concerned to prove his manliness, Poe
gained one of the coveted cadetships to West Point, only to chuck it
half-way through. Here the analogy with Maugham - whose West Point was St
Thomas's Hospital - ends. Maugham accepted the world on its own terms;
something, as this book makes painfully clear, Poe could never bring himself
to do.
Poe married his cousin Virginia Clemm when she was 14. To this often sick,
ethereally lovely girl, Poe seems to have been more of an admired big
brother than a husband. He called her Sissy and her mother, Marie, who
always lived with them, was Mabby. Ten years later Virginia was dead. By one
of those numerical ironies with which the work and life of Poe is riddled,
24 was the age at which his own mother had died. He made one or two
determined attempts to re-marry among female poets and bluestockings but,
still a widower, he was dead himself a few years later - a classic example
of a literary genius ending his life as a burnt-out case.
Until the end his output was prodigious. Poems, stories, essays, a novel -
The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym - together with endless streams of
ephemeral journalistic items, poured out of him and into the various
magazines for which he wrote. The only interruptions to his flow of work
were those extended periods when he took to drink. They became quite
frequent in his latter years.
In spite of his immense industry, his many successes and his eventual
world-wide fame, there was no breakthrough into affluence. Poe was often his
own worst enemy; even so one cannot but feel he was cruelly done by. He
reaped little benefit from having pioneered many of those genres of
literature that have flourished commercially as popular entertainment since
his death. Historians of the detective story like Julian Symons agree that
Poe first gave it a definitive form in tales such as The Murders in the Rue
Morgue, The Mystery of Marie Roget, The Purloined Letter. His investigator
C. Auguste Dupin anticipated the methods of Sherlock Holmes. In another
famous tale, The Gold-Bug, with a detective element and concerning buried
treasure, he gave a lead to RL Stevenson. But the bulk of Poe's tales were
gothic horrors or spine-chillers. As a master of the macabre Poe is without
a peer.
Less well-known to the general public is his work as a literary theorist.
His essays on poetic composition were influential, particularly in France
where Baudelaire became a disciple. Poe was an early and vicious exponent of
the hatchet-job in criticism and reviewing. He laid into Longfellow and the
other New England writers whose hegemony he resented with savage ferocity.
The 'Frogpondium' was his contemptuous collective name for them.
Had he lived 50 or so years later when the laws of copyright became subject
to international agreement and authors began to receive royalty payments
instead of surrendering their work for outright fees, Poe would certainly
have become a rich man. Merely the royalties from his poem 'The Raven' - its
reception 'might be compared to that of some uproariously successful
hit-song today', Silverman says - would have kept him and his wife in luxury
for years. As it was it earned him only a few dollars initially with further
paltry fees for public readings of it.
His limitation - and this ultimately debars him from being classed with the
truly great - is also his strength: his obsession with literary mechanism,
his love of the ornately calculated effect, of what he called in his 'tales
of ratiocination' (the word detective was not then in use) the operation of
acumen in solving the mystery. As Alfred Kazin has written in A Writer's
America, 'Poe is the only American classic of whom it can be said that his
landscapes issued from his mind alone . . . He never quite overcame thinking
of landscape as a problem or situation.'
Even so, Poe's influence was lasting and it remains, whether in the fiction
of novelist-cryptographers like Nabokov and Umberto Eco, or in serious
horror-film directors like Roeg and Cronenberg. Silverman has performed a
valuable task. He presents all the ascertainable facts about Poe's life and
art as a coherent narrative.

<TEXT>
   A rare book by Edgar Allen Poe that a
Massachusetts man picked up for $15 in a New Hampshire barn was
auctioned for $198,000, putting the seller in a ``dream world,'' an
auction house official said.
   The first-edition copy of ``Tamerlane and Other Poems,'' only
the 12th known copy of Poe's first book published in 1827, was sold
at Sotheby's auction house Tuesday to a rare book dealer for less
than expected.
   Even so, the Massachusetts seller was `extremely happy,''
Sotheby's Vice President David Redden said. ``He's still in, I
think, a sort of dream world over the whole business.''
   The seller, who demanded anonymity said he found the book in an
antique barn in southern New Hampshire. The barn was not identified.
   Poe, who paid to have the book published by an obscure Boston
publisher, went on to write such classic poems and stories of
horror and romance as ``Annabel Lee,'' ``The Raven,'' and ``The
Tell-tale Heart.''
   ``It's the rarest book in American literature _ it's the most
famous book in American literature,'' said the buyer, Manhattan
book dealer James Cummins. ``It's the book that every rare book
seller hopes to get his hands on.''
   Cummins said he was buying the book for a ``serious book
collector'' from New York and was ``very pleased'' with the price,
which Sotheby's described as a record for a work of American
literature.
   Sotheby's had estimated the book's value at $200,000 to
$300,000. The $198,000 price includes the 10 percent commission
that goes to Sotheby's.
   The soft-cover book, which contains the long title poem and nine
shorter ones, bears no reference to Poe, listing the author only as
``a Bostonian.'' Although Poe was born in Boston, he lived there
only a few months before his parents moved to Richmond, Va. He
lived in Boston again for about eight weeks when ``Tamerlane'' was
published.
   The work had been written about five years earlier, when Poe was
12 or 13 years old. There is no indication that a single copy of
the book was ever sold, and it never has been highly regarded by
critics.
   Its value is considered historical more than literary, since it
is the first and rarest work by Poe.
   Of the 11 other known copies of ``Tamerlane,'' all but one are
owned by libraries or other institutions. The only other one in
private hands is on loan to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.
   Also sold Tuesday were four handwritten notebooks by Nobel
laureate Saul Bellow that comprised the rough draft of his 1970
novel, ``Mr. Sammler's Planet.''
   The notebooks, believed to be the first archive of a major
living author's published work to be auctioned during his life,
brought $66,000.

EDGAR ALLAN POE, HIS LIFE AND LEGACY by Jeffrey Meyers John Murray Pounds
25.00, 348 pages
EDGAR POE grew up expecting to be rich. His parents, travelling actors in
post-Independence United States, died when he was a boy. Poe was informally
adopted by a Virginia merchant who hoped to shape him into an heir who would
be suitable, in due time, to take over the business and the slaves. Allan's
name was inserted into his own as a sign that he had a new father.
Poe was given the liberal education of a Southern gentleman, but no money.
When he tried to eke out his income at the University of Virginia by
speculative gambling, he was forced to leave. He then enlisted as a soldier
and became a serjeant. Allan rescued him back to gentility, arranging for
him to go to the officer school at West Point, with the prospect of a
secure, financially independent and honourable career. But, with the dour
persistence of his Scottish ancestors, Allan again demanded love and
gratitude but paid Poe a hopelessly inadequate allowance. As the problems
mounted, he refused to settle his son's debts, closed his ears to anguished
appeals, and stood self-righteously by when he went to jail.
In 1831 Poe took matters into his own hands. He deliberately refused
military orders every day for a month, was court-martialled, declined to
offer a an explanation, and was dismissed from the service. He had at last
broken free, but the disgrace cut him off from his family and his prospects.
He was an orphan again.
For the rest of his life Poe earned an uncertain income as magazine editor
and short story writer, seldom out of difficulty and sometimes crushed by
worry. He swung between care and recklessness, abstinence and binge. When he
was 27 he married Virginia Clemms, then aged 14, who declared in the oath
that she was 21. They had been living together for some months. The early
signs of her tuberculosis were already visible, the coughing of blood
followed, and she died a few years later.
Poe - in what was to become a tradition among American men of genius - drank
himself to death when he was 40. When asked what things harmed a writer, he
is said to have replied 'Politics, women, drink, money, ambition. And the
lack of politics, women, drink, money, and ambition.'
Externally Poe's life was as romantic and as doomed as that of any invented
Byronic hero. But it was not enough. Poe pretended to have set off to fight
in the Greek War of Independence and to have visited St Petersburg. Other
incidents merge fact and fantasy. Some of the erudite, exotic, wonderfully
evocative, quotations from Italian authors with which he prefaced his tales
turn out to have been his own composition.
In his excellent new biography, Edgar Allan Poe, His Life and Legacy,
Jeffrey Meyers reconstructs the life with unobtrusive skill, demonstrating
but not exaggerating the extent to which Poe adapted his own experience in
his poems and stories. In a final section he traces the development of Poe's
reputation. The book is well researched, judicious, fluent, scholarly and
readable.
Poe is one of the fathers of the modern detective story. The conventions of
the tradition from Sherlock Holmes to Inspector Morse are already present -
the admiring matter-of-fact narrator, the misleading clues, the bumbling
official force, the sharp easily forgiving detective who prefers justice to
the law - although not all in the same story.
But in the tales of the imagination Poe created something far more
mysterious, a world of enchantment, terror, desire, and impending disaster.
Long before Freud wrote about the unconscious, Edgar Allan Poe had ventured
into the dark cellars and vaults of the mind. Poe is sad, strange, and
unique, and in Meyers he has found a worthy biographer.

<TEXT>
   The dark figure who visits Edgar Allan Poe's
grave every year was captured on film by a photographer who used
surveillance equipment to snap the only known picture of the annual
rite.
   But the identity of the man remains a mystery worthy of Poe, the
patriarch of American mystery writers. The photographer did not
approach the shadowy figure or try to spoil his secret.
   Every Jan. 19 since at least 1949, on the anniversary of Poe's
birthday, someone has left three roses and a bottle of cognac on
the writer's grave. Poe died in Baltimore in 1849.
   Life magazine, in the July issue that hit newsstands Monday,
includes a picture of the figure during his early-morning visit.
   Bill Ballenberg, a free-lance photographer in New York, spent
$17,000 from Life to rent infra-red, night-vision equipment, which
he set up facing Poe's original grave and the monument he rests
beneath.
   When the darkly clad visitor appeared at the grave at 3 a.m.,
Ballenberg took the picture by a remote radio signal from inside
Westminster Hall, the Presbyterian church that overlooks the
graveyard.
   ``We had about 30 seconds. It was really fast. It was like 12
hours of boredom punctuated by 30 seconds of terror,'' Ballenberg
said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allen Poe House, allowed the
photographer and a magazine writer to wait with him for the visitor
last Jan. 19, the 181st anniversary of the writer's birth. The two
agreed not to try to nab, identify, talk to or otherwise disturb
the visitor.
   The picture shows the back of a man kneeling at the grave where
Poe was buried for 26 years. Because the photo was taken with a
nightscope, which intensified the available light 35,000 times, the
somewhat fuzzy photo shows only the visitor and the grave within a
circle of light.
   ``I could see his body. I never could see his face. No one could
see his face. He had a hat and a scarf pulled up well around his
face, securing his face,'' Ballenberg said.
   Poe died at the age of 40 after being discovered in a delirium
on a Baltimore street in 1848. He had stepped off a steamer and was
en route to New York after visiting his childhood sweetheart in
Richmond, Va.
   The circumstances of his death remain unclear. Some researchers
of Poe attributed his state to a fever; others pointed to the late
stages of alcoholism and a deteriorating mind.
   For 26 years, Poe's remains lay under a medium-sized stone in
the graveyard. A larger monument was erected in front of the
downtown burial ground and he was reinterred in 1875.
   Jerome, who became curator in 1979 and began the overnight
vigils, has been accused of orchestrating the visits, which he
denies. But he said he uses the publicity and annual birthday
celebrations to draw attention to the works of the writer.
   Witnesses' accounts indicate that several different men have
brought the cognac and roses in the 40 years since the offerings
were spotted by the church curator.
   No one else will be allowed to photograph the mysterious
visitor, Jerome said.
   ``This was a once in a lifetime chance.''

A mysterious stranger who leaves three roses and a bottle of cognac on Edgar 
Allan Poe's grave every year on the author's birthday has been captured on film 
for Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A New York photographer, armed with $17,000 worth of sophisticated equipment, 
took what apparently is the first photograph ever of the visitor to the West 
Baltimore grave. 
</P>
<P>
But the visitor's identity still is not known. 
</P>
<P>
The photo appears in Life magazine's July issue, due on newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Bill Ballenberg staked out the Westminster Burying Ground on Jan. 
19, Poe's 181st birthday, and snapped a fuzzy photo of a man in an overcoat 
crouched at the gravestone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hours and hours of boredom punctuated by less than a minute of sheer 
panic," Ballenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballenberg had accompanied Life magazine writer Gary Smith to Baltimore to 
investigate the graveyard tradition, which dates at least to 1949 and doubtless 
has been carried out by more than one person. 
</P>
<P>
Smith initially wanted to uncover the visitor's identity. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said he was persuaded by Poe House curator Jeff Jerome not to disturb 
the visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant so much to him to not ruin the mystery. We decided to respect his 
wishes," said Smith, who suggested the story to Life after seeing coverage of 
past graveyard visits. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome said he agreed to let the Life team wait with him for the visitor this 
year, as long as they did not try to nab, identify or talk to the man. "That's 
none of our business," Jerome said. 
</P>
<P>
Poe, whose most widely read poems and stories include "The Raven" and "The Pit 
and the Pendulum," was found semiconscious on a Baltimore street Oct. 3, 1849, 
and died four days later.

ANN CONWAY: MONDAVI LIFTS GLASS TO POE;

<P>
'PRICE, PINOT AND POE' TO SALUTE THE ACTOR, THE AUTHOR, THE WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Why don't they just let him be crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
Actor Vincent Price is sitting in the sun-filled living room of his Beverly 
Hills bungalow, sipping pinot and talking about Edgar Allan Poe. Art crowds the 
walls of the room and treasures from all over the world jam every available 
table surface. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to prove he wasn't crazy," Price continues, shaking his head. 
"He was the greatest American writer. He invented the romantic lyric song poem, 
the Gothic tale, the detective story. Why don't they just leave him alone?" 
</P>
<P>
The moment becomes a preview of sorts. On Oct. 25, Price will visit the Robert 
Mondavi Wine and Food Center in Costa Mesa to appear at a dinner dubbed "Price, 
Pinot and Poe." 
</P>
<P>
The actor is delighted about the chance to visit Orange County to sample pinot 
noir, dine (on "pumpkin, pigeon and pears," says an organizer) and entertain 
more than 100 guests with poetry by Poe. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a lot of movie roles based on Poe," Price says. " 'The Tell-Tale 
Heart,' 'The Masque of the Red Death,' 'The Pit and the Pendulum,' 'The Cask of 
Amontillado.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing then that intrigued me most about Poe was that he is the 
kind of author -- there's one for every country -- that kids think they have to 
read. They forget he is the greatest writer of his kind in the world, that his 
influence on art is incredible. Everybody thinks of Poe as the bogeyman." 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for Price to recite the macabre at the Mondavi. "I hope to bring 
some of Poe's romantic works to the dinner," Price says. "About 65 percent of 
his pieces are very sophisticated and romantic, very unlike the others." 
</P>
<P>
Price's love affair with wine began "years ago in St. Louis, Mo. -- where I was 
brought up," he says. "Where we just had grapes. You know, wine started with 
grapes; there weren't always these fancy names and things. It was wonderful 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in wine. I worked with the Wine Institute before 
it was called the Wine Institute. I was always trying to get people to learn 
about wine. It could be pretty terrible in those days unless you knew which 
wine to drink." 
</P>
<P>
Price's knowledge of the grape is what led Eric Hansen, director of the Mondavi 
Center, to ask the legendary actor to come to Costa Mesa. Last year, Hansen 
invited Price to speak about food and wine at the Kapalua Bay Club on Maui, 
Hawaii, at an annual wine symposium. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Price was wonderful," Hansen says. (Included in the witty actor's speech 
was a recipe for dishwasher trout that he'd whipped up for Johnny Carson on 
"The Tonight Show": "Tightly wrap trout in foil with lemon, wine, parsley, salt 
and pepper. Put it through the whole cycle. No soap!") Also appearing at the 
symposium was "Jeopardy" game show host Alex Trebek. ("I hope to have Trebek -- 
a great cook -- appear at the Mondavi one of these days soon," Hansen says.) 
</P>
<P>
"At the Mondavi Center we like to associate wine with the arts," Hansen 
explains. "And when I came to the idea that it would be great to have poetry, I 
thought of Mr. Price. Let's just say we're elevating Poe and pinot to very good 
company." 
</P>
<P>
When it came time for Price to have his picture taken for this story, he donned 
a straw hat and strolled slowly into his garden -- as packed with flowering 
plants and statuary as his house is with art and souvenir treasures. 
</P>
<P>
"I love hats," says the suave veteran of such film classics as "Laura" with 
Gene Tierney and "Victoria Regina" with Helen Hayes. "Do you think I should 
have dressed up more? When you look at the French magazines you always see 
people drinking wine casually. It doesn't always have to be a dress-up kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cooking up gourmet fare for the event will be Gary Jenanyan, head chef of the 
"Great Chefs Program" for the Robert Mondavi winery in Napa Valley, and Rosanne 
Ruiz, formerly of the Sorrento Grill in Laguna Beach and now in-house chef for 
the local Mondavi Center. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the guest list for "Price, Pinot and Poe" is film producer Tony 
Bill, owner with Liza Minelli and Dudley Moore of the 72nd Market Street 
restaurant in Los Angeles.

   One of 12 known first editions of Edgar Allan
Poe's first published book sold at auction for $165,000, Sotheby's
said.
   The book, ``Tamerlane and Other Poems,'' went to a private
American collector, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the
auction house.
   The copy sold was one of two in private hands; the other sold at
Sotheby's last year for $198,000, Stewart said.
   Also Tuesday, a four-page autographed letter by Herman Melville
to Nathaniel Hawthorne's wife was bought for $132,000 by Profiles
in History, a Beverly Hills, Calif., dealer in books and
manuscripts, she said.
   In the Jan. 8, 1852, letter to Sophia Peabody Hawthorne, who had
complimented Melville on ``Moby Dick,'' the author denied that the
book contained any symbolism.
   Tuesday's sale of American literature and children's books from
the library of H. Bradley Martin totaled $2.6 million, Stewart said.
   Sale of the collection was to continue today with Americana,
including George Washington's copy of ``The Federalist Papers.''

FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Perfect poems, poor lives - Anthony Curtis on the
French poets Baudelaire and Mallarme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAUDELAIRE by Joanna Richardson John Murray Pounds 30, 602 pages
MALLARME: A THROW OF THE DICE by Gordon Millan Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 30,
389 pages
Yeats said 'The intellect of man is forced to choose, perfection of the
life, or of the work'. Never can that dilemma have appeared with greater
clarity than it does in the lives of the two French poets, Baudelaire and
Mallarme, of whom new biographies have just appeared. Both of them sought
ceaselessly for perfection, and in many of their poems actually achieved it.
Between them they are largely responsible for the modern notion of formal
perfection as a poetic ideal. It was their disciplined response to the
interminable flood of verse that poured out of a Victor Hugo or a Tennyson.
Ironically it was the last of the fluent Victorians - Swinburne - who was
the first English poet to hail Baudelaire's genius - in an article in The
Spectator in 1862. Since then almost every major English poet, starting with
Yeats, Eliot and Auden, has paid tribute to Baudelaire as the founding
father of modernism.
The ideal of perfection helps to explain what we find most puzzling about
Baudelaire and Mallarme, their veneration for the work of Edgar Allen Poe.
Baudelaire's admiration for Poe verged on idolatry; he translated much of
Poe into French, one of the few things that brought Baudelaire some regular
income. Though Baudelaire was by far the greater poet, it was Poe's writings
on poetic technique and theory as well as the morbidity of his
subject-matter that fertilised the mind of Baudelaire. The seeds of the
Frenchman's notion of correspondence - involving a synthesis through words
of all the arts, music, dance, painting, literature - the bedrock of
symbolism, may be found in Poe.
But, as emerges from Joanna Richardson's massive new life of Baudelaire,
there were also remarkable parallels between his life and that of Poe. Both
lost their natural fathers when they were little; both became
mother-fixated; both had adoptive fathers of a military cast who despised
poetry; both adored women but found straightforward sex impossible; both
became chronic invalids; both were invariably in debt.
The last full biography of Baudelaire was by Enid Starkie in 1957. If her
scholarship could at times be faulted, Starkie was always an enthusiast and
she presented a Baudelaire redeemed by her admiration for his work. With
much fresh material at her disposal, Richardson gives us a remorseless march
of all the grim facts, concentrating on the poet's disastrous financial
situation. From his improvident youth to his death aged 46 it never
improved.
What makes it so heart-rending is that his degradation could easily have
been avoided. Baudelaire inherited a sizeable fortune at the age of 21.
Prudently managed he could have lived off it - supplemented by his small
literary earnings - in comfort and dignity for the rest of his life. Within
a few years he had got through half of it, and had burdened himself with
supporting a mulatto mistress Jeanne Duval - the Black Venus of his poetry -
from whom he caught the syphilis that ultimately resulted in the aphasia
(loss of the faculty of speech) that caused him to spend his last years as a
virtual mute.
General Jacques Aupick, the epitome of careerist respectability in the
Second Empire, called a family council to decide what to do about his
prodigal stepson. It was decided that Baudelaire's remaining capital should
be administered by a conseil judicaire allowing him a small annual income.
Baudelaire's stormy relations with his administrator, a family friend who
kept very tight control of the purse-strings, provide an element of pathetic
comedy in the sad story.
Apart from Jeanne Duval, two other women captured his heart - Apollonie
Sabatier, the white Venus who looked like one of Rubens models and who
inspired many of les Fleurs; and the actress Marie Daubrun, who was the
inspiration behind 'le Beau Navire' and 'L'Invitation au Voyage'. Baudelaire
competed for their favours among many gifted men. With the former he
triumphed to the point where she finally confessed her love for him. The
saddest episode of all is his inexplicable failure to turn this dream of a
perfect love into a reality.
Mallarme was one of the earliest of the younger French poets to recognise
Baudelaire's poetic mastery. His own life, freshly told by Gordon Millan,
professor of French Studies at Strathclyde University, was not quite such a
mess, though he too suffered from continual financial constraint. He made a
stable marriage, fathered a daughter who became his literary executor, and
acquired a reputation in his lifetime. But his work as a provincial
schoolmaster, irksome from the start, became intolerable as his poetic gift
developed.
Somehow he managed to get a posting to Paris where his house became a forum
of abstruse poetic speculation. His regular Tuesday evening gatherings were
attended by many artists and writers including the young Paul Valery, his
most gifted disciple. They were in no doubt about Baudelaire's genius and
they developed his theory of correspondence. Some of Mallarme's abstruse
poems and sonnets, always popular with English readers, exemplify it.
At least one of his longer works - 'L'Apres midi d'une Faune' - found a
perfect musical correspondence in the mind of Debussy - and after that in
the work of choreographers and dancers, Nijinsky, Lifar, Arthur Mitchell.
Millan's book reveals the slow evolution of the original poem. He
demonstrates the contrast between the poet's tormented, precarious existence
and the radiant purity of his vision. That indeed is the message of both
these books.

Kanaga, said Wednesday. Thiemann asserts the video game, endorsed by 
professional baseball, falsely pledged that its users could simulate being a 
baseball manager by choosing which players to field. But the boy found the game 
"just has lists of uniform numbers" -- insufficient information because 
baseball reference books aren't based on the numbers, Kanaga said. Nintendo had

Last Bash: An alcohol-treatment center in Newport, R.I., has published the 
memoirs of Billy Carter, the late, beer-guzzlin' brother of former President 
Jimmy Carter. "Billy: Billy Carter's Reflections On His Struggle With Fame, 
Alcoholism and Cancer," was released by the publishing arm of Edgehill Newport,

   Quoth the raven, ``out,'' ``help,'' ``come
on, let's go'' and ``let me out'' _ but never ``nevermore.''
   The two-pound bird with a 2{-foot wingspan arrived Thursday at
the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium from San Jose, Calif.
   ``Out!'' cried the raven when bird trainer Barbara Osborn
released it from a traveling kennel into a large cage.
   The bird was turned over to the Humane Society last September by
a woman who reportedly adopted it illegally as a nestling or an
unhatched egg, then found it more than she could handle.
   The bird was uncomfortable except in human company and even
scared of crows, so society officials contacted the Non-Releasable
Animal Placement Program in Texas, which advertised the bird's
needs in its newsletter. Officials at Point Defiance, who had been
hoping to add a raven to the zoo's population, responded.
   The raven has been dubbed Poe or Poette, depending on its sex,
which zoo biologists have yet to determine. Unlike the raven in the
famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe, however, this bird never says
``nevermore.''

   Johnny Fever doesn't work there and
the musical format is country instead of rock 'n roll, but WKRP is
on the air again.
   WNVI-AM in North Vernon, a town of 6,000 people, has adopted the
call letters of the fictional radio station in the 1970s television
comedy ``WKRP in Cincinnati.''
   ``Everybody's heard of WKRP,'' said station manager Shawn Lynch.
However, only listeners in and around Jennings County will be able
to hear the 1,000-watt station.
   WNVI management jumped at the chance to capitalize on the name
recognition when the last WKRP, in Dallas, Ga., decided to change
its name. Federal Communications Commission regulations allow just
one station at a time to have the call letters.
   The station ushered in its new name April 1 by duplicating a
``WKRP in Cincinnati'' episode that featured a turkey drop from an
airplane.
   ``Instead of live turkeys, we dropped a helium-filled,
turkey-shaped balloon over the high school, where they were playing
a ball game,'' Lynch said.

   Some Farmers Branch police officers
were blue about being dressed in brown, so city officials shelled
out some of the green stuff for spiffy new uniforms.
   Police in the Dallas suburb had complained that they were often
mistaken for security guards because of their brown uniforms _ even
by police in surrounding cities.
   The television series ``Hill Street Blues'' didn't help morale
much.
   And then there were all the cars in the area with bumper
stickers reading ``Back the Blue,'' part of a public campaign to
support the blue-clad Dallas police following a series of officers'
deaths.
   City Manager Ron Escalante's suggestion box brimmed with
proposals that the police change their uniforms, and City Council
responded by voting to spend more than $23,000 to buy blue
uniforms, which are expected to be ready next month.
   ``It's been the biggest morale boost we could ever have given
them,'' said city spokeswoman Donna Huerta.

The Mystery Writers of America, formed in 1945, is the senior organization of 
crime writers in this country. Its annual Edgar awards (named, of course, for 
Edgar Allan Poe, who is generally saluted as the founding father of the form) 
are the most prestigious in the field. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 awards, presented at a formal banquet last week at the start of a 
three-day ingathering of mystery authors, editors and publishers, confirmed the 
range of work that falls under the umbrella of "mystery," from a Broadway 
musical to traditional puzzles and hard-edged works heavy on social realism 
rather than arsenic at the vicarage. The prevailing tone was a cheerful feeling 
that the public's appetite for mystery in all its guises is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence includes the frequent appearance of mystery writers on the 
best-seller lists: P. D. James, Ruth Rendell, Tony Hillerman, Mary Higgins 
Clark, Dick Francis, Joseph Wambaugh and others whose works are technically 
thrillers rather than mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing popularity of "Murder, She Wrote" and the "Mystery" series on PBS 
is also heartening to the mystery trade. The committee that chose the Edgar for 
best mystery motion picture deliberated among 51 titles (some candidates 
indubitably far-fetched). The numbers in other categories were equally 
impressive: 75 candidates for best first mystery novel, 220 entries for best 
novel, 60 young adult mysteries, more than 600 short stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Edgar for best novel went to James Lee Burke for his "Black Cherry Blues," 
set partly in Louisiana, where Burke has lived, and partly in Montana, where 
Burke now lives. It features his series character, a former New Orleans cop 
named Dave Robicheaux, who first appeared in "The Neon Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Burke, a one-time Los Angeles Skid Row social worker, writes with poetic 
intensity about a very real and often ugly world. His stories develop a double 
suspense because Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic whose struggles to stay 
dry despite the tensions and frustrations of the case at hand are painful but 
heartening. 
</P>
<P>
Burke has also written four non-mystery novels and his short stories have 
appeared in the Kenyon Review and other literary journals. His work reflects 
one strain of present mystery writing, toughly realistic but compassionate, 
entertaining in the hard-edge tradition but qualifying as a work of social 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Men outnumbered women among the winners, yet it seems significant that three of 
the five nominees for best first mystery novel were women, including Los 
Angeles' Melodie Johnson Howe, a former Universal contract player whose "The 
Mother Shadow" was very well reviewed. The winner was "The Last Billable Hour" 
by Susan Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a significant trend in the mystery field, it is the increasing 
frequency and popularity of mysteries by women, with women as protagonists, 
like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, taking over Ross Macdonald's Santa Barbara 
beat, and Sara Peretsky's V. I. Warshawski, finding crime and social problems 
going hand in hand in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys have suggested that perhaps one published mystery in four is 
written by a woman. Yet the ratio seems deceptive, probably because women 
historically and today have been disproportionately successful in the field, 
from the days of Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery 
Allingham in England, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Mignon Eberhart and several others 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
This is Christie's centenary year -- she was born in 1890 and died in 1976 -- 
and there will be elaborate observances in England and elsewhere. Her 84 books 
continue to sell in innumerable languages and to find new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's grandson, Matthew Pritchard, who oversees the ongoing sales and 
productions of her work, was an honored guest at the awards banquet and at a 
90-minute seminar Saturday on the durability of Christie's work. 
</P>
<P>
She was, the panelists agreed, an unparalleled puzzle maker, especially 
ingenious at diverting the reader's eye from the culprit yet making the 
ultimate revelation inevitable rather than arbitrary. As one of the panelists 
said, the reader's reaction is most often: "Fooled again, but fairly." 
</P>
<P>
It is a kind of conjuring trick, and Pritchard noted that his grandmother was 
fascinated by magic tricks and in fact briefly employed a butler whose gifts 
included performing magic. 
</P>
<P>
The question often asked at gatherings of mystery writers and readers is why 
the form should have such a continuing and evidently growing popularity. Prof. 
B. J. Rahn of Hunter College, an expert on P. D. James, Ruth Rendell and other 
English writers, thinks that the charm of the mystery is that restores order 
after chaos, in a world that sometimes appears increasingly chaotic. It also 
metes out justice in a world where justice is not always seen to be done. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional puzzle mystery was escapist fare, ideal for train rides, 
hammocks and sleepless nights. Yet even the escapist fare, Rahn says, reflected 
its times. Christie's characters, said Mary Higgins Clark, who chaired the 
seminar, were not stereotypes but prototypes, and they reveal the times 
Christie lived in and the places she knew, from English villages to 
archeological digs where she spent a month each summer with her husband Max 
Mallowan. 
</P>
<P>
What Edgar Allan Poe began, Arthur Conan Doyle and Christie made a worldwide 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The other Edgar winners included Jack Olsen's "Doc: The Rape of the Town of 
Lowell," as best fact crime book. Norman Sherry's "The Life of Graham Green, 
Volume I: 1904-1939" was the best critical or biographical study. The Larry 
Gelbart/Cy Coleman/David Zippel musical "City of Angels," won an Edgar as best 
mystery play. (It was also the only nomination.) 
</P>
<P>
Keith Peterson's "The Rain" was chosen the best paperback original mystery. 
Surprisingly, the Edgar for best motion picture went to "Heathers," a blackish, 
brackish comedy thriller about murderous and suicidal games among high 
schoolers. The runners-up were Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," "Sea of 
Love," "True Believer" and "Licence to Kill," the most recent James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
A special Raven award went to Carol Brener, for her tenure as owner of the 
pioneering Manhattan mystery book shop, Murder, Ink. 
</P>
<P>
The Mystery Writer's Grand Master award for an entire body of work went this 
year to Helen McCloy, now 86, who published her first mystery in 1938.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Glass meets Poe in the House of Usher - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five or six years ago the minimalist composer Philip Glass took a break from
writing monster stage-pieces, to devise (with Arthur Yorinks) a chamber
opera after one of Edgar Allan Poe's most famous horror tales. The Fall of
the House of Usher had its premiere in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988; the
following summer, Music Theatre Wales staged it at the Vale of Glamorgan
Festival. Last week they revived it for the Huddersfield Festival of
Contemporary Music, and it is touring southward to reach the Queen Elizabeth
Hall on December 18.
I caught up with it in the Oxford Playhouse on Sunday. Michael McCarthy's
efficient production fitted the stage well, with Richard Aylwin's chunky set
suggesting both hi-tech cruelties and the gloom of a Victorian pile - it
doubles as Roderick Usher's library and the family vault, with plenty of
stage mist. The neurasthenic Roderick, as you may remember, is the last of
his line, devoted (possibly incestuously) to his fey sister Madeline.
She dies, and is duly interred - but she is not quite dead. In one of Poe's
craziest, most overwrought visions, a friend of Roderick's reads from an
ancient epic over weirdly apposite sound-effects, the sounds of Madeline
struggling out of coffin and vault to expire at last on her brother's
breast: cue fall of House.
The grip of the original tale depends upon the wild efflorescence of Poe's
language. For operatic purposes, of course, most of that has to go. When
Debussy set out to make a one-acter of it, the music instead was to recreate
the haunted atmosphere. It is a tribute to Glass's indomitable chutzpah that
with Debussy's fragments now recovered, filled out by other hands and
staged, he should set the story in his own chugging style, as much brutalist
as minimalist.
Endlessly repeated chords and arpeggios, mostly bland and diatonic: the odd
'wrong' note is slipped into the harmony for piquancy, but it never leads
anywhere. One half-expected that the Glass manner might suit the obsessive
character of the tale, but despite the 12-strong band and a keen conductor,
Michael Rafferty, the effect is soon soporific - except when the volume is
rudely turned up to make climaxes. Early Glass used to be altogether more
interesting.
The plot does not bear stretching over two acts (two hours with interval).
The principals - Julian Pike as Roderick, Anne-Margrethe Elkaas as Madeline,
Gwion Thomas as the faceless friend - strove ably to invest their plain
vocal lines with intensity and character beyond what the music contains.
Glassophiles may detect more virtue in this piece than I could do; well,
they will get their chance on the South Bank.

<HEAD>The Artists: Lyric Opera Harmonizes Innovation and Solvency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General director Ardis Krainik is steering the
Lyric Opera of Chicago into the 21st century, and she feels the way
to reach the wild blue yonder is to stay in the black.
   Once again this year, the woman who told Luciano Pavarotti his
services were no longer needed in Chicago has come up with an
operatic marvel rarer than a superstar tenor. It's called solvency.
   ``We haven't had a deficit since 1981, and for the second year
in a row our entire season was sold out by opening night,'' Lyric
spokeswoman Susan Mathieson said. ``Our ticket sales will top $11
million. Our fund-raising goal for the year is $7.95 million, and
we're right on target for that, too.''
   The current eight-opera season at Lyric, which began Sept. 14,
is the first of a decade-long initiative Miss Krainik has dubbed
``Toward the 21st Century.'' It's a program meant to showcase
often-overlooked 20th century operatic works, reshape productions
of more traditional operas and - most importantly - point the way
to the future.
   That future, as Miss Krainik sees it, is ``our own, unique
American opera, not just a hashed-over European art form.''
   Chicago's first taste of what such opera might be came Oct. 27,
when Lyric presented its first production of Minnesota composer
Dominick Argento's 1976 work, ``The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe.''
   Although Argento's hallucinatory opera had been performed
before, both in the United States and Europe, it had never received
a full-scale production in a major house until Miss Krainik hired
Pulitzer Prize-winning director Frank Galati to realize it on the
Lyric stage.
   The opening night audience greeted ``Poe'' with wild applause
and multiple curtain calls - an enthusiastic response for a complex
tale filled with death, madness and suggestions of necrophilia.
   Appropriately, ``Poe'' was still running over Halloween, and the
timing reflects the canny Krainik strategy that has sold out the
3,564-seat Civic Opera House for every performance in recent years.
That strategy mixes innovation, superstar vehicles and old
favorites.
   The 1990 season began with soprano Jessye Norman's Chicago
debut, which came in a work so old it was new - Gluck's 1767
``Alceste.'' The 18th century music was juxtaposed against Robert
Wilson's ultramodern set designs and costumes, the first production
he had done for an American opera house.
   ``Alceste'' caused grumbling among some audience members, who
complained of the lack of English-language supertitles that have
become standard under Miss Krainick's management.
   All other Lyric productions this season have supertitles,
including ``Poe,'' which is sung in English.
   After ``Alceste,'' Lyric's season moved to the mid-19th century
sumptuousness of Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin'' and on into the
early 20th century with Puccini's ``Girl of The Golden West.'' The
Puccini work gave tenor Placido Domingo a chance to revel in the
spaghetti Western role of ``Johnson di Sacramento'' and to romance
the keeper of the Polka Saloon.
   Then came ``Poe,'' complete with premature burial, a pendulum
and a Masque of the Red Death.
   ``Red's not a color we like around here, financially, but it's
fine for costumes,'' Ms. Mathieson commented.
   The rest of Lyric's 1990-91 season is more traditional fare.
``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' ``Rigoletto'' and ``Carmen'' will span the
Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period, and a reworking of its acclaimed
1985-6 ``The Magic Flute'' will appear in January.
   Miss Krainik has not announced the 1991-2 portion of ``Toward
the 21st Century,'' but she says composer William Bolcom is
preparing ``McTeague,'' an operatic version of Frank Norris' 1899
naturalistic novel as the centerpiece of the 1992-3 season.
``McTeague'' is to be staged by film director Robert Altman, who
will be tackling the same material Erich Von Stroheim used for his
silent movie epic ``Greed.''
   The 1992-3 season also will feature the beginning of an even
more ambitious project, a remounting of Richard Wagner's monumental
``Ring'' cycle. Zubin Mehta is scheduled to conduct one of the four
``Ring'' operas each season until 1996. The entire cycle is to be
performed again in the spring of that year.
   Miss Krainik says world premieres of two other operas will occur
in the 1996-7 and 1999-2000 seasons - and both will be by American
composers.
   It's a major departure from the views of Miss Krainik's late
predecessor, Lyric founder Carol Fox, whose predilection for
European works and singers earned the Chicago company the nickname
of ``La Scala West.''
   Miss Fox's idea of a tribute to the U.S. Bicentennial was to
commission Polish composer Kryzystof Penderecki and British
playwright Christopher Fry to do an operatic version of John
Milton's ``Paradise Lost.'' That work had its premiere two years
late, in 1978, with sets designed to fit the stage of Milan's La
Scala, not Chicago.
   ``Paradise Lost'' cost a reported $2 million and added to the
sea of red ink that threatened to drown Lyric by 1980. In that
year, Lyric's board persuaded the ailing Miss Fox to step down
after 26 years and elevated Miss Krainik, who had been artistic
director since 1975.

   Canadian marathon swimmer Vicki Keith, still
tired from crossing the English Channel two weeks ago, had to
abandon her effort to butterfly from Santa Catalina Island to the
mainland after 19 hours.
   ``I don't consider this a failure,'' she said. ``I figure I just
went out there and gave it my best shot.''
   Keith's support crew persuaded her to quit after the exhausted
and hallucinating athlete gained less than half a mile in the last
eight hours Friday, said crew member Craig Williams.
   She had covered more than 18 of the 24 miles across the San
Pedro Channel when she gave in.
   Keith thought that a huge tanker was inches from her as she
swam, Williams said. Hallucinations are normal for her during
marathon swims, he said, but not until she's been in the water for
36 hours.
   The 28-year-old schoolteacher mastered all five of the Great
Lakes last summer and raised more than $550,000 for a Toronto
sports training and fitness center and a children's aquatic center.
   This summer she made the 42-mile English Channel crossing and
swam 14 miles across Australia's Sydney Harbor, also in marathons
associated with children's charities.

   LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. (AP) _ After an insult from a
much-younger man, old pro wrestler Buddy ``Nature Boy'' Rogers
added some injury.
   A 30-year-old rowdy picked on the wrong old man, police said
last week. Rogers, 68, had just ordered lunch in a sandwich shop
when Theodore Terhune of Pompano Beach burst in looking for someone
named Mike.
   When he was told Mike wasn't there, he began verbally abusing a
pair of employees, police said, and Rogers asked him to quiet down.
   ``He called me an old man,'' said Rogers, in his day the star of
the pro wrestling circuit and still powerfully built. ``He said:
`If you want a piece of me, you can have me right now.'
   ``I pushed him against a wall and he picked up a chair and threw
it at me,'' Rogers said. ``Then I unloaded. I gave him a shot and
he must have flown five feet into a refrigerator. Then I nailed him
in the stomach, and he flew into the kitchen.''

   Director George Romero is back at the scene of
his first, 1968 horror classic, ``The Night of the Living Dead,''
to make his 11th feature film.
   ``Now it's sort of become a signature. I'm known as that guy who
works in Pittsburgh,'' he said recently during filming of ``The
Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.''
   ``Anything's cheaper than New York or (Los Angeles), but that's
not really the factor,'' Romero said. ``It's a varied kind of look.
All people don't want their films to have palm trees in them.''
   Filming of ``M. Valdemar,'' starring Adrienne Barbeau, Ramy Zada
and E.G. Marshall, started July 10 and is scheduled to conclude
Aug. 5.
   The film is an adaptation of a short story by Edgar Allan Poe
and will be teamed with another adaptation of a Poe story, ``The
Black Cat,'' and released under the title ``Two Evil Eyes.''
   ``I grew up with Poe. I've always had an affinity for the genre.
Even as a kid, those were the movies that I watched and the comic
books I read, and Poe was the only author I could actually read in
school and get my kicks,'' said Romero.

   Cowboy singer Rex Allen hasn't got a case
against the late Slim Pickens or the actor's family or estate
because of injuries he sustained at Pickens' Wyoming cabin, the
state's Supreme Court ruled.
   The singer sued for damages for loss of sight in one eye
following a 1983 fall, but the court said Friday there was no
negligence on the part of Pickens.
   Allen slipped on overgrown grass partly covering steps to the
cabin while looking for a key Pickens had at one time told him was
hidden. At the time of the accident, Pickens was seriously ill in
California.
   In upholding a summary judgment that had gone against Allen in
lower court, the Supreme Court ruled that neither the Pickens
family nor the actor's estate was responsible for maintaining the
cabin for unexpected guests.

   Philadelphia Orchestra music director
Riccardo Muti has been named an honorary ambassador by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the orchestra reported.
   The formal announcement was made Saturday in Salzburg, Austria,
by U.N. High Commissioner Jean-Pierre Hocke. Muti, who is also
music director of Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy, immediately
announced two benefit concerts to be held in 1990 in Milan and in
1991 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.
   Muti's acceptance is a public commitment to the ``defense of
human rights and to the cause of the world's 14 million refugees
whose basic human rights have been threatened,'' said Bonnie
Arnold, orchestra spokeswoman.
   ``If we look at history, artists of all kinds, painters,
scluptors, writers and musicians have always been amongst the most
influential and the most deeply involved members of society,'' Muti
said in Salzburg.

Edgar Allan Poe and Steven Berkoff: a marriage made in Heaven or perhaps for
some spectators Purgatory. Both favour the wilder side; both plough their
own imaginations; both choose the Gothic and place style before content. So
Berkoff performing Poe's Tell Tale Heart is an awesome experience.
The silences, and the slow drawing out of certain of Berkoff's favourite
words, like 'stealthily', are only matched by his rat-a-tat explosions of
action. As the mad man who murders the miser to avoid the stare of his fishy
blue eye, Berkoff is as well matched as a sweater to Edinburgh. And as the
drama proceeds from the slow laborious preparations for the killing to the
rising, insistent, reproachful beat of the dead man's heart as it pounds
from its hidden grave, so Berkoff winds up the audience to the pathetic
climax. Sometimes the words are strangulated beyond meaning; but the body
never fails to speak loudly and Berkoff even makes a virtue of mime. No one
climbs an imaginary staircase better; no one opens the door with more dread.
This is how Dickens must have transfixed an audience at his public readings
and if it owes more to Victorian excess, to the Henry Irving School of
acting than to sophisticated realism, that is spot on for Poe. Berkoff
brings death to life.
The other two monologues in his show at the Assembly Rooms are superficial
stuff, some rhyming nonsense about a failing actor, and an East End tough
singing the praises of his killer dog. But Berkoff uses his physical
presence to more effect than any rival and he makes a convincing case for
his self-proclaimed if slightly odd genius.
Twenty-three year old Crispin Whittell has hardly edged into the public
limelight as a dramatist but this year's Killing Him (The Pleasance) adding
greatly to the reputation he established last year with his play Success
must suggest a great future.
Black (or White) Wednesday is already an important historical date and the
tensions, both private, political and philosophical, that it generated are
superbly captured in Whittell's play. The dialogue cracks along, with City
slang, designed to make the awful seem palatable, running happily with
spouts of poetical lyricism. The style is so sharp that we take defeat and
murder happily in our stride. The four characters screw each other and
themselves to perfection but the moral survives beneath the wit in the
audience's total identification with the only decent character, an
unemployed birdwatcher. Wonderful acting; an unexpected treat.

   A man convicted of kidnapping and
murdering a businessman by burying him alive in a coffin-like box
``took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar Allan Poe
nightmare,'' the prosecutor says.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Ficaro is seeking the death
penalty for Daniel J. Edwards, 31, of Bourbonnais, who was
convicted Monday.
   The jury deliberated about an hour before finding Edwards guilty
in the Sept. 2 abduction of Stephen Small, who suffocated while
buried in a rural section of Kankakee County in northeast Illinois
before his family could pay the $1 million ransom.
   Small, 40, was a great-grandson of former Gov. Len Small and a
member of a family with major media holdings. He was vice president
of Mid America Media, which owned radio and cable television
stations before its sale in 1986.
   Edwards showed no emotion when it was announced he had been
convicted of three counts of murder and 10 counts of aggravated
kidnapping.
   The jury will reconvene Wednesday to determine whether he should
be sentenced to death.
   In his closing argument in the week-long trial, Ficaro said
Edwards knew the Kankakee businessman wouldn't survive the burial.
``I never saw anybody come out of a grave,'' Ficaro said.
   ``Take a good long look,'' he told jurors as he pointed to the
homemade plywood crate in which Small died. ``Danny Edwards' greed
for the big score drove those nails, dug that grave and buried
Stephen Small alive.
   ``All Danny boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put
Stephen Small .. in a box,'' said Ficaro, slamming his hand on the
crate. ``He took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar
Allan Poe nightmare.''
   Edwards was ``a man who made greed his god,'' and planned for
Small to die so he could not tell police what had happened, said
Assistant Attorney General Frank Nowicki.
   Defense attorney Sheldon Reagan argued that a faulty air supply
system caused Small's death. He pointed out that Small was buried
with candy bars, lights, and water, and had not been harmed.
   ``It's an accident but it's not an intentional murder,'' said
Reagan, who sugggested someone else abducted Small.
   ``You don't make a box by accident,'' countered Ficaro.
``Stephen Small didn't wander by and fall in.''
   The prosecution argued that the candy bars, lights and water _
along with the plastic pipe the kidnapper claimed was for air _
were used to lure Small into the box.
   Small was lured from his Victorian home after midnight Sept. 2.
His wife, Nancy, received ransom calls throughout the day but could
not understand her husband's tape-recorded instructions for
delivering the cash.
   Two days later, police found Small's body buried under 3 feet of
sand about 13 miles southeast of Kankakee.
   ``Danny Edwards needed Stephen Small to make those tape
recordings and ... get in that box without a fight,'' said Nowicki.
   He said Small clawed, scratched and struggled to get out of the
box as he used up the limited air supply, but probably died within
hours.
   Edwards' live-in girlfriend, Nancy D. Rish, 26, awaits trial on
kidnapping and murder charges.

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disciples of fantasy-horror writer H.P.
Lovecraft are campaigning to mark the 100th anniversary of his
birth with a hometown monument to the man who inspired a generation
of spinners of creepy tales.
   The work of Lovecraft, an obscure pulp-magazine writer in his
lifetime, was rediscovered in the 1940s and he is mentioned in the
same breath as Edgar Allan Poe as the forerunner of today's
blockbuster authors of the macabre.
   ``Lovecraft probably influenced more writers stylistically
anywhere in America except Ernest Hemingway,'' said Robert Bloch,
author of the novel that inspired the movie ``Psycho,'' and one of
those who want Providence to put up a plaque honoring the hometown
author.
   ``I really think the city would be honoring itself, and
Lovecraft will take his place beside Poe,'' Bloch said.
   ``I think that Providence really has a debt to pay,'' said Jon
B. Cooke of Friends of H.P. Lovecraft, a group campaigning for a
memorial.
   City officials aren't eager to honor the writer, fearing they'd
set off a torrent of similar requests.
   The effort, however, gets a boost this weekend from the Horror
Writers of America, who are holding their annual meeting here to
mark the centennial of Lovecraft's birth.
   In a fitting tribute, the authors and screenwriters planned to
toast Lovecraft with champagne, at dusk, at his grave in Swan Point
Cemetery on Friday night.
   Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence on Aug. 20,
1890. He spent a brief period in New York, returning in his mid-30s
to live with two aunts until he died March 15, 1937, a victim of
Bright's disease and cancer.
   During his lifetime, he published just one book, ``The Shadow
over Innsmouth,'' in 1936. Most of his fantasy and horror tales
appeared in such pulp magazines as Weird Tales and Amazing Stories.
   Posthumously published collections of his stories inspired such
horror superstars as Stephen King and Clive Barker, and remain
popular among those who frequent the fantasy shelves in bookstores.
   Those books include ``The Outsider and Others,'' published in
1939; ``Beyond the Wall of Sleep,'' 1943; ``The Dunwich Horror,''
1945; ``The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,'' 1952. The product of
what some people called Lovecraft's ``sick'' mind was a world
dominated by sinister aliens, evil beings living in basements, and
beastlike creatures terrorizing helpless people.
   Bloch, in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles home, said
he never met Lovecraft in person, but was one of several aspiring
horror writers with whom the author corresponded.
   ``His encouragement to a teen-age kid in the middle of the Great
Depression was supremely responsible for my career,'' said Bloch,
73, who went on to write 54 books, 10 film scripts, a radio series
based on his stories, and about 70 television shows.
   Lovecraft's headstone is the city's only reminder that Lovecraft
hailed from Providence, other than his tales _ where he referred to
the city as the ``Divine Providence.''
   The horror writers and Friends of H.P. Lovecraft want the
memorial erected at Prospect Terrace, a park the author frequented,
and Cooke's group has raised more than enough money to pay for it.
   The city doesn't allow such markers, said Nancy Derrig,
superintendent of parks. She suggested the Lovecraft devotees take
their case to Brown University, where the writer's papers are
stored at the John Hay Library.
   Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. once proposed putting a plaque at
one of Lovecraft's homes, but nothing came of it.
   Brown has a Lovecraft symposium scheduled for mid-August.
   And fans want a Lovecraft-inspired movie, the upcoming
``Re-Animator II,'' to have its premiere in Providence.
   ``He's light on plot and character, but pretty strong on
atmosphere,'' Cooke said. ``He'll scare the hell out of you.''

MAN CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF TEENS IN CAR

A Rancho Palos Verdes man who allegedly fired his gun into a carload of 
teen-agers on a scavenger hunt, injuring a 16-year-old boy, has been charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an inhabited vehicle.

Carl Faulkner, 43, faces up to 13 years in prison, if he is convicted of the 
two felony charges filed Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after 10 p.m. May 28 when three Rolling Hills 
High School students drove to the home of varsity baseball coach Garry Poe to 
take Poe's license plate, a sheriff's investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Poe said he aborted the prank when his daughter told him that someone was 
outside their house on Rockinghorse Road in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Youth Wounded 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were not released, sped off but drove into a dead end 
and had to turn around and drive back past Poe's home, according to the 
Sheriff's Department. Poe's neighbor, Faulkner, whose home had been burglarized 
recently, fired a shot at the car as it drove off, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The shot struck one of the youths in the arm, leaving a minor flesh wound. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, sheriff's deputies said the three 16-year-old 
students might be charged with trespassing, but the district attorney's office 
has declined to prosecute. The youths were not trespassing because Poe's car 
was parked in the street and their tampering with the license plate was so 
minor that it does not warrant filing criminal charges, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Martin Oghigian. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, a contractor, could not be reached for comment.

   Those convicted of first-time drug possession in
Judge Ted Poe's court will get probation with a twist: their cars
must bear a bumper sticker reading ``Texas _ Don't Mess With
Drugs.''
   ``It's not going to move mountains, but it's just another way of
communicating that drugs are harmful,'' the state judge said Monday.
   Before instituting the policy, Poe's probation requirements
usually included regular urinalysis and drug treatment.
   The decals are a toned-down version of those many people
convicted of drunken driving must have on their cars warning
motorists that the driver is a felon and advising them to report
erratic driving to police.
   So far, the judge has given the stickers to six offenders. He
offers probation to first-time, non-violent offenders only, and not
to drug dealers.
   ``The only place (a dealer) is going to be able to put a bumper
sticker is on his tractor up at the penitentiary,'' Poe said.
   Poe is known for his creative probation requirements. Some
people placed on probation in his court worked on the restoration
of the battleship Texas, and a drunken driver had to erect a cross
where he killed the victim.
   ``The old paths are not the proven paths,'' Poe said of his
unorthodox ways.

Los Angeles designer Gregory Poe, who makes and peddles his pricey clothes in 
Japan, is setting the stage for his entry into the U.S. market -- literally. 
Poe, 32, designed the flashy costumes for "The Geography of Luck," a play 
opening today at the downtown Los Angeles Theatre Center. Set in Las Vegas, 
Poe's most spectacular female get-up is a Kelly green showgirl number, complete 
with satin, feathers, sequins and beaded headdress. Poe, who says he plans 
later this year to start selling his other designs in the United States, 
describes the "Geography" costume gamut as "anywhere from very glitzy showgirls 
to white trash."

Stylist to the stars Angelo di Biase has left his post at Umberto to become the 
style director at Char Salon. Di Biase is known for creating the unusual hair 
styles sported by Rosanna Arquette, Beverly D'Angelo and Ellen Barkin. His work 
will be seen in the movie "Johnny Handsome," featuring Barkin and Mickey 
Rourke. Di Biase will also be responsible for coiffures showcased in "Robocop 
II." Guess even robots need the right "do."

Step Right Up, Folks

Here's a new approach to hair salon protocol. At the Accent salon, clients are 
taken on a walk-in basis only. No appointments accepted. And those who wait 
more than 45 minutes for services are granted a 50% discount. There are seven 
of these shops in U.S. cities now, and there will be one in Los Angeles this 
year, says Mary Tingle, a spokeswoman for the company. They cater especially to 
the hair-care needs of black men and women, and use both Gentille and Nucleic A 
products, she tells Listen.

Looks like Tom Petty is into the hippie scene, judging from the decorative 
patches on his blue jeans. Listen caught sight of him the other night, with 
rocker Billy Idol close by. Idol isn't joining the Woodstock Revisited look, 
despite all the hoopla lately about this being the 20th year after. He's still 
wearing his ubiquitous black leather with fringe. This time he added a 
horsehide vest, complete with Pinto markings. What would the hippie vegetarians 
say about that?

<TEXT>
   Poet Mark Strand, an English professor at the
University of Utah, was named Friday as the new poet laureate
consultant in poetry at the Library of Congress.
   Strand, who also is a short-story writer, editor, translator and
author of children's books, will start his one-year assignment in
September.
   He will receive $35,000 to give a poetry reading and a lecture
during the year, to work with students and to advise Librarian of
Congress James H. Billington on new library acquisitions.
   He will succeed poet Howard Nemerov, who served for two years.
   The position of consultant in poetry was created 54 years ago,
but Congress voted in 1985 to expand the title to designate its
holder as the equivalent of poet laureate of the United States.
   Since then, four poets have been named as poet laureate
consultant in poetry at the libary. Besides Strand and Nemerov,
they were the late Robert Penn Warren and Richard Wilbur.
   Strand has published seven collections of poetry. His eighth,
``The Continuous Life,'' is to be released in October. He also has
translated works by other poets, written three children's books and
two books on art, and has published three anthologies.
   A former Fulbright Scholar, Strand taught at 14 colleges and
universities, including Harvard, Yale and Princeton, before he
joined the University of Utah faculty in Salt Lake City in 1981.
Among his awards are the Edgar Allan Poe prize in 1974 and the
National Institute of Arts and Letters award in 1975.

TWO SMASH WINDOW, FLEE JUVENILE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Two teen-agers used a cot as a battering ram to break a window pane and escape 
from San Diego County Juvenile Hall on Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths -- a 15-year-old federal detainee and a 17-year-old accused of 
murder -- broke out five minutes after probation officers had routinely checked 
the room they shared, said Jim Poe, deputy chief probation officer of juvenile 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old is charged with smuggling people across the border, a U.S. 
marshal said. The 17-year-old was arrested in the Feb. 16 fatal shooting of a 
35-year-old man at a Logan Heights duplex, said Carlos Armour, chief of the 
juvenile division of the district attorney's office. Murder charges were filed 
against the 17-year-old Tuesday, and a detention hearing had been scheduled for 
Wednesday, Armour said. 
</P>
<P>
The hall, with a capacity of 219 beds, had 405 detainees Tuesday, Poe said. He 
said that police had asked that the 17-year-old be separated from another 
detainee who was also being held in connection with the killing and thus was 
placed in a "less secure room." The more secure area has an extra fence and 
reinforced windows. 
</P>
<P>
Poe said the escape comes at a time when the Probation Department is awaiting 
bids to build a new facility and to upgrade the existing one, which is usually 
filled beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The officers checked the room at 7:55 p.m., Poe said, but were sent to quell a 
fight that had broken out in the day room a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned to their rounds -- about five minutes later -- they saw the 
broken window, looked out and saw the pair running east toward the fence that 
surrounds Juvenile Hall, Poe said. The boys scaled the fence and disappeared, 
he said, adding that behind the fence are a hill and Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department helicopters and canine units searched but found nothing, 
Poe said.

AN AUTUMN STORY, BY TOMMASO LANDOLFI,TRANSLATED FROM THE ITALIAN BY JOACHIM 
NEUGROSCHEL (ERIDANOS PRESS: $20, CLOTH; $11, PAPER; 145 PP.)

Tommaso Landolfi occupies an odd place in modern Italian literature as one of 
its most admired and least read writers. He has the reputation of being a 
"writer's writer," most of whose novels and short stories are out of print 
despite the high praise of authors as distinguished as novelist Italo Calvino 
and poet Eugenio Montale. "An Autumn Story" -- one of Landolfi's last books, 
written just four years before his death in 1979 -- makes it easy to understand 
why he has sparked the enthusiasm of the few but not of the many. 
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning of this short novel one has the impression of entering 
an extremely strange and yet familiar literary universe. It is a dark and 
stormy night, the nameless protagonist, a fugitive from war, comes upon a 
lonely aristocratic mansion guarded by two fierce hounds, with no human 
inhabitants in sight. After breaking into the house, he meets its solitary 
owner, an old but ferocious nobleman who reluctantly allows him to stay the 
night. The narrator prolongs his visit as he finds himself increasingly drawn 
in by the sense of mystery in this enormous, largely abandoned manor house. The 
evasiveness of his host, the strange sounds within the house, the seemingly 
endless labyrinth of musty, cobwebbed rooms and an alluring portrait of a 
beautiful woman over the fireplace take hold of the protagonist's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the background is clearly the German occupation of Italy at the end of 
World War II, Landolfi keeps the circumstances as vague as possible in order to 
create an atmosphere of timelessness. The language is lavishly ornate with an 
old-fashioned, musty quality not unlike the fading, mildewing wallpaper of the 
mansion itself. We are not really in this world at all but in the verbal world 
of the gothic novel, of Edgar Allen Poe or of Nikolai Gogol (whom Landolfi 
translated into Italian). There are many superficial resemblances to Poe's "The 
Fall of the House of Usher" -- the lone aristocrat, a horrible family secret, 
the crumbling mansion and the baroque language. 
</P>
<P>
One night the narrator awakes convinced that someone is standing over him, 
breathing; but when he reaches for a match, his room is empty. The following 
day he decides to search the house, something his host has strictly forbidden 
him to do. Exploring, he finds evidence of a woman living hidden in the house, 
a woman who appears to wear the same clothes as the one in the old portrait 
above the fireplace. Risking death, the protagonist follows the owner when he 
retires at night and watches him perform a bizarre religious-satanic rite 
through which he raises the spirit of the dead woman from out of the fire. When 
the narrator screams in terror, the specter vanishes. In the struggle that 
ensues between the two men, the old man swoons in a fatal stroke. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonist flees but cannot help returning a few days later. He finds the 
woman from the portrait -- except that she is young, beautiful and very much 
human. She explains that she is the daughter of the old man and the woman in 
the painting and has lived as her father's captive for her entire life. The 
narrator and the young woman fall in love but when members of the invading army 
arrive she is raped and killed before his eyes. And so the narrator ends up 
like a younger version of the old man, tied irrevocably to the crumbling 
mansion by a powerful, impossible passion for a dead woman. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the course of this bizarre tale, the novel degenerates from an 
alluring story of imagination into a kind of gothic melodrama. Landolfi is at 
his best when he is conjuring the as-yet-unknown mysteries of the house with 
its noises and dark passageways, but when he brings the plot to its climax the 
fascination of his spell seems to break just as the specter of the woman 
vanishes at the narrator's scream. 
</P>
<P>
But "An Autumn Story" is not as silly as its plot would make one believe. In 
fact there is something peculiarly modern to this apparently old-fashioned 
tale: Landolfi seems to be self-consciously creating a purely verbal universe, 
which has no more reality than the feverish incantation that the old man 
recites to invoke the spirit of his dead wife. 
</P>
<P>
Landolfi, an archaic modernist, uses the conventions of the gothic novel for 
rather esoteric purposes. His mixing of genres and his belief in the hypnotic 
power of language are perhaps what attracted a modernist like Calvino. For the 
same reason, however, Landolfi is an odd, hybrid writer, who defies easy 
classification, making him a kind of literary fish out of water, unlikely to 
attract a wide audience.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING GALLERY DEATH IS RULED A SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of a 19-year-old man who shot himself Thursday night at a public 
shooting gallery was not an accident but a suicide, the Orange County coroner's 
office said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Ricky Son Dang of Huntington Beach, died after shooting himself in 
the head at 7:44 p.m. at the Firing Line, 17921 Jamestown Lane. Police 
initially reported the death as an accidental shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, authorities said that subsequent investigation determined that 
the man deliberately shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Apparent reasons were the young man's despondence over "education and family 
problems," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Charles Poe said Friday that investigators found 
that Dang went to the shooting gallery Thursday night with several male 
teen-age friends. Poe said Dang rented a .380-caliber pistol, put it to his 
head and shot himself. Poe said Dang did not disclose his suicide intentions to 
his friends and fired the shot with no warning. The young friends "were shocked 
and stunned," Poe said.

<HEAD>Sticks and Stones Can't Break Rambo's Bones _ But Oh Those Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sticks, stones, tanks and helicopters can't hurt
Rambo, but critical words are sharper than death for Sylvester
Stallone.
   ``Oh yeah, it hurts,'' says Stallone, and he remembers some that
stung.
   ``Like, `this is a guy who should now consider going to
Louisiana and become a bayou fisherman.' That's a little rough. Or
when someone will say, `his career is stranger than crib death.'''
   It hurts so much he laughs.
   ``In one way it is very humorous. But if I said these things to
a child ... the kid would be in an institution by the time he was
12. He would have no ego. He'd be gone,'' said Stallone, who was
grinding through a full day of interviews to promote the $63
million ``Rambo III.''
   ``I've seen a lot of actors, they get on a bad roll and they
keep descending and the critics keep pounding on them. And maybe
rightly so, but too harshly. I mean, lighten up a little bit or
you'll kill that character.''
   ``Rambo III'' follows the failure of ``Over the Top,'' in which
Stallone played a trucker who wins his son's affection, in part,
through arm-wrestling. ``In `Over the Top,' I just felt that the
movie was what it was, a simple little movie,'' he said. ``It was
sold, I think, improperly because people perceived it as this big
action epic, and it wasn't.''
   Stallone, 41, was all but unknown when ``Rocky'' burst on the
screen in 1976. Made for $1.1 million, ``Rocky'' took in more than
$45 million at the box office, won an Academy Award for best
picture, and received best-actor and best-screenplay nominations
for Stallone.
   Later films have made more money, but none has enjoyed that kind
of critical success.
   ``Rambo III'' figures to be critic-proof, returning to the
violence-laden formula that carried ``Rambo II'' to a worldwide box
office of $270 million.
   ``People say, `yeah, you're giggling all the way to the bank,'''
said Stallone, who picked up nearly $20 million for reprising his
role.
   ``No! No! The money is a result of the success of the film, but
if you are perceived as a failure in the eyes of your peers _ you
see what I mean? _ you have a problem.
   ``It reminds me of the character in `East of Eden,' Jett Rink _
remember that? _ when he has a banquet and no one shows up? He's a
billionaire, and he stands there all alone, and he collapses on the
table. Seating for a thousand, and he's all alone.''
   Stallone, though, expects to keep going for a while, and he
joked about a sequel way down the line: ``We find out that Rambo
had a brother, and it's Rocky Balboa. And they meet, and we do like
a Hayley Mills split screen,'' he said.
   ``We could keep this baby going on forever. I know we're
reaching, it's getting kind of thin on plot, but let's go for it.''
   Stallone has gotten this far on the script:
   ``Why don't you cut your hair, brother?''
   ``Noooooo.''
   Meanwhile, he's scouting ideas for ``Rambo IV,'' and getting
ready for ``Rocky V'' and even talking about ``Cobra II.''
   When it comes to his characters, Stallone is no killer.
   ``It's hard. Not if I like them, no, I really can't,'' he said.
   ``Because I think people die a hundred times over when you keep
them alive. When their honor is gone, and they've been shamed
publicly, or their manhood has been impugned irreparably _ whew!
Death is easy. Living is hard.''
   In terms of critical acceptance, Stallone thinks maybe he should
have followed David Morrell's book, ``First Blood,'' and killed
Rambo in the first film. It was shot that way at first, but wasn't
palatable to test audiences or to the star.
   ``He was a psycho in the book, and being true to that character,
he wiped out everyone,'' Stallone said.
   ``And I think it would have been a great movie on that level
too, but it would have been a harsh expose. I think it would have
received more accolades, that this was an important film like
`Platoon' or `Coming Home' if we had stayed with it, because that
really would have been an indictment.''
   Stallone has talked about playing a Hasidic cowboy, or doing a
film on religion. One project he's given up is starring as Edgar
Allen Poe in a screenplay he wrote years ago.
   Audiences just wouldn't buy it, he said.
   ``I'd be saying, `Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered
weak and weary,' and you know someone would say, `Remember when he
used to carry a gun?' The image of the long hair and headband would
like _ woooooaaaaah! _ be superimposed.
   ``What's he gonna say? `Yo! Quoth the raven! Yo! Poe!'''

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED FOR FIRING AT TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Rancho Palos Verdes man has been placed on three years' probation after 
pleading no contest to a charge of firing a handgun into a carload of 
teen-agers on a scavenger hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook also ordered Carl Faulkner, a 
44-year-contractor, to pay a $500 fine and to turn over his gun to authorities 
to be destroyed, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Geltz. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner was charged with shooting into an occupied vehicle last June after he 
allegedly fired one shot into a car carrying three Rolling Hills High School 
students, slightly injuring a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
The May 28 shooting occurred after the students had gone to the home of the 
school's varsity baseball coach, Gary Poe, to take Poe's license plate as a 
prank. 
</P>
<P>
Poe, alerted by his daughter that someone was outside their house, aborted the 
prank, sheriff's investigators said. As the youths sped off, Faulkner, a 
neighbor of Poe's, fired a shot at the vehicle, investigators said. Faulkner's 
home had recently been burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Faulkner pleaded no contest to a felony charge, Shook reduced it to 
a misdemeanor, which carries less severe probation violation penalties, Geltz 
said.

LA JOLLA WRITER HAL G. EVARTS JR., 74, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal G. Evarts Jr., a 49-year resident of La Jolla whose literary career spanned 
more than 50 years and included stints as a free-lance writer, journalist and 
novelist, died Sunday after a fall at home. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas native collected two Edgar Allan Poe Awards from the Mystery Writers 
of America for his novels "Treasure River" in 1964 and "Smugglers' Road" in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, he started writing adventure and mystery stories for young 
readers, including the popular "Big Foot." 
</P>
<P>
The American West was the theme of many of Evarts' earlier novels, including 
"Colorado Crossing," "Man Without a Gun" and "The Sundown Kid." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1936 from Stanford University, where he earned a bachelor's 
degree in English, Evarts traveled around the world. He incorporated his 
experiences in such remote areas as Tibet and western China into magazine 
articles, short stories and novels. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote 28 novels and more than 100 short stories. 
</P>
<P>
Evarts' writing career began in 1935 as a reporter with the San Diego Evening 
Tribune. In 1939, he signed on with the European edition of the New York Herald 
Tribune in Paris. After only a few months as a foreign correspondent, he was 
out of a job when the impending German occupation forced the office to suspend 
operations in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Europe in 1945 as a combat historian before settling in La Jolla 
the same year and resuming his career as a free-lance writer. 
</P>
<P>
Evarts is survived by his wife, Dorothea Abbot Evarts; a daughter, Ginger 
Wadsworth of Orinda; sons John of Santa Ynez and Bill of San Diego and five 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The family requests that friends remember him with gifts to the Anza-Borrego 
Desert Natural History Assn., Hal G. Evarts Memorial Library Fund, P.O. Box 
311, Borrego Springs, CA 92004.

<TEXT>
   The man who disarmed the Lone Ranger will be
spending lots of time around horses, but he'll be cleaning up after
the animals rather than riding them.
   Edward Louis Young III, convicted of stealing pistols owned by
Jack Carlson ``Clayton'' Moore, was sentenced to spend 600 hours
cleaning up after the horses at the Houston Mounted Patrol's
stables.
   The task could take 2{ years if Young spends 20 hours a month
shoveling manure at the Houston Mounted Patrol's stables.
   Judge Ted Poe said the punishment was fitting for the theft of
the weapons from the hero who's been bringing evil outlaws to
justice on television and in movies for a half-century.
   Poe also sentenced Young on Tuesday to a month in Harris County
Jail and placed him on probation for 10 years.
   Young, a 45-year-old former airline baggage handler, was
convicted of stealing Moore's chrome-plated, twin Colt .45-caliber
revolvers at Houston Intercontinental Airport on Dec. 24, 1986. An
appeals court recently upheld the conviction.
   ``I carry no animosity and I'm certainly a believer in law and
order, and one thing for sure, the Ten Commandments,'' Moore said
Wednesday from his California home. ``And one of those is `Thou
shalt not steal.'''
   Moore was signing autographs the airport when his bags
disappeared.
   Aside from two U.S. Customs inspectors, Young was the only other
person in the baggage area when Moore's luggage and guns were
stolen. Young was apprehended after police traced him as the person
who sold the weapons at a jewelry and gold exchange. He contended
someone had sold him the pistols and holsters for $200 outside a
pawn shop.
   Young's lawyer based his appeal on insufficient evidence and the
fact that Poe let the Lone Ranger wear his sunglasses and white hat
while testifying.
   Poe, who often wears cowboy boots under his judge's robe in
court, said he had no intention of ordering Moore to remove his
trademark hat.
   ``I wasn't about to be the one who revealed the identity of the
Lone Ranger,'' Poe joked. ``Outlaws have been trying to find it out
for years.''

<P>
Eric Hansen had been plying Vincent Price with wine for months. Thursday night, 
just in time for Halloween, those bottles of pinot noir finally paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Making a rare public appearance, Price came to Costa Mesa to be the centerpiece 
for Hansen's upscale answer to trick-or-treating. The director of the Robert 
Mondavi winery's Southern California outpost, Hansen had organized an evening 
when $150 bought a grab bag of recent vintages, a gourmet dinner and the 
presence of Price, who read a sampling from his favorite poet. In order of 
descending importance, the black-tie affair was titled "Price, Pinot and Poe." 
</P>
<P>
Charged with upgrading the image of wine in a culture more familiar with Night 
Train Express than Chateau Rothschild, Hansen reasoned that the presence of the 
famed actor would add a touch of class to the business of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to associate fine wine with the artistic community, and the man is 
truly an artistic treasure," Hansen said of Price, who has appeared in films 
ranging from "Laura" to "Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine." 
</P>
<P>
"But more than that," Hansen said, "he is a great connoisseur of fine food and 
wine." 
</P>
<P>
Price, whose viticultural expertise once led President Lyndon B. Johnson to 
seek his advice on California wines, opened his remarks with a crowd-pleaser: 
Poe, he recalled, "could juggle the book and the bottle with equal dexterity." 
</P>
<P>
He then launched a 20-minute discussion of the appropriately disturbing poesy 
of Poe, beginning with "The Conqueror Worm," a comment on mortality as well as 
the title of one of Price's many Poe-derived films. 
</P>
<P>
The actor continued with such works as "The Bells" and concluded with what 
might be considered Price's own signature piece, "The Raven." 
</P>
<P>
Would he read it again? "Nevermore," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Price had more current terrors on which to comment. He made pointed 
reference to the crusades against artistic freedom led by Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) and others. 
</P>
<P>
The chilling of free speech particularly concerns Price, who recalls that when 
he started making movies in the 1930s, filmmakers were severly restricted in 
what they could show. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd gotten so far since then. We emerged as the most creative nation on 
earth," Price said. "Then we get set back by some fool trying to make his name 
in politics. It's such a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Price said he was heartened by the recent acquittals in the 
obscenity trials of Contemporary Arts Center officials in Cincinnati and the 
rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will all pass eventually, just like it did before," he said, 
referring to the McCarthy era. "Somebody will finally say no (to censorship), 
just like the people on that Cincinnati jury did." 
</P>
<P>
He had less faith, however, that the audience at hand would see the linkage of 
Poe, Luther Campbell and the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it went straight over their heads. It's Orange County. You're never 
sure what they'll get down here," the Yale-educated actor said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this was not a group that was ready to discuss 19th-Century poetry, 
1990s rap or, for that matter, the Roger Corman exploitation pictures that 
etched Price his place in film history. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, like children lining up to meet a shopping center Santa Claus, the 
stemware-clutching sophisticates waited eagerly to have their pictures snapped 
with the macabre legend. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in testimony to the potency of the evening's treats, they amused Price 
with somewhat inaccurate attempts to compliment him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased to hear you knew Sinclair," said a local developer, apparently 
confusing Price's reference to Sinclair Lewis, the author of "Babbitt," with 
the novelist-politician Upton Sinclair. Price nodded politely. 
</P>
<P>
When a woman forthrightly asked Price his age, the 79-year-old actor deviously 
replied, "90!" 
</P>
<P>
"You know," she said reassuringly, "my grandmother lived till 96." 
</P>
<P>
Price smiled at the woman, before making an aside: "These people are so full of 
it. They'll swallow anything." 
</P>
<P>
To be fair to the 100-odd folk who came to experience the good life with Price, 
few had any pretensions of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good idea to bring fine wine and fine acting together," said Yorba 
Linda drapery company owner Rick Ashbrook, 43. "But I certainly didn't 
appreciate these things in my 20s. I grew up as a surfer in California. What 
did we appreciate? Probably nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Some confessed that they didn't even have that much familiarity with Price 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know he acted," said Darci Davis, one of the youngest at the 
affair. The 17-year-old from Dana Point, who came with her father, a Mondavi 
employee, remembered just one exposure to Price's distinctively diabolical 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I ever heard him was on the 'Thriller' record," she said, 
referring to the Michael Jackson song that features Price's narration. 
</P>
<P>
Price may be cultivated, but he's no snob. 
</P>
<P>
"People kidded the pants off me when I did that," he said. "But it's a good 
album. I listened to it the other day, and it really holds up." 
</P>
<P>
So, it seems, does Vincent Price.

McKinley, was born in Niles, Ohio.
   In 1845, Edgar Allan Poe's poem ``The Raven'' was published under
a pseudonym in the ``New York Evening Mirror.''

'Contemptible' Chaucer to 'Vulgar' Voltaire
---
By Ned Crabb</HL>
<DD> 01/28/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The following is one of the rottenest reviews I've ever read about a published work: "It is a vulgar and barbarous drama, which would not be tolerated by the vilest populace of France, or Italy. . . . 
one would imagine this piece to be the work of a drunken savage." 

   That was Voltaire writing in 1768 about "Hamlet." 
It is one of 175 excerpts of scathing notices in "Rotten Reviews: A Literary Companion" (Pushcart Press, 93 pages, $12.50), edited by Bill Henderson and with an amusing, perceptive introduction by Anthony Brandt. 
The book demonstrates that literally no one literary eludes revilement from some source. 

   Lord Byron didn't like Shakespeare either: "{His} name, you may depend on it, stands absurdly too high and will go down." 
And he thought Chaucer "obscene and contemptible: he owes his celebrity merely to his antiquity." 
Byron, however, got his from John Quincy Adams: "His versification is so destitute of sustained harmony . . . 
I have always believed his verses would soon rank with forgotten things." 

   H.L. Mencken, the critic of everyone and everything, called Henry James ". . . an idiot, and a Boston idiot, to boot, than which there is nothing lower in the world." 
Ralph Waldo Emerson couldn't abide Jane Austen; her novels, he said, are "imprisoned in the wretched conventions of English society, without genius, wit or knowledge of the world. . . . 
The one problem in the mind of the writer is marriageableness. 
Suicide is more respectable." 
His dislike was shared by Charlotte Bronte: "Why do you like Miss Austen so very much?" she wrote to G.H. Lewes in 1848. 
"I should hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen, in their elegant but confined houses." 
But, then, a British critic named James Lorimer writing about "Wuthering Heights" made it plain he couldn't take Charlotte Bronte or her sister Emily: "Here all the faults of 'Jane Eyre' (by Charlotte) are magnified a thousand fold, and the only consolation which we have in reflecting upon it is that it will never be generally read." 

   Critics pummeled Walt Whitman vilely: "He is morally insane, and incapable of distinguishing between good and evil, virtue and crime"; "as unacquainted with art as a hog is with mathematics." 
Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" was curtly dismissed as "A gross trifling with every fine feeling. . . . 
Mr. Clemens has no reliable sense of propriety." 
And another critic dismissed Twain himself: "A hundred years from now it is very likely that 'The Jumping Frog' alone will be remembered." 

   But then, Twain also could be a lethal critic, especially when it came to James Fenimore Cooper: "In one place in 'Deerslayer,' and in the restricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences against literary art out of a possible 115. 
It breaks the record." 

   Edgar Allen Poe's writing offended Leslie Stephen, who in his 1874 book, "Hours in a Library," stated: "After reading some of Poe's stories one feels a kind of shock to one's modesty. 
We require some kind of spiritual ablution to cleanse our minds of his disgusting images." 

   Twentieth-century American critics weren't nearly so hyperbolic, but they were just as misguided. 
Clifton Fadiman, writing in The New Yorker, described William Faulkner's 1936 novel "Absalom, Absalom" as "The final blowup of what was once a remarkable, if minor, talent." 
In 1925, a critic wearily discharged F. Scott Fitzgerald: "A little slack, a little soft, more than a little artificial, 'The Great Gatsby' falls into the class of negligible novels." 

   "Rotten Reviews" also includes excerpts from rejection letters; they're amusing in retrospect, but must have been terribly alarming to the recipients. 
I wonder how Rudyard Kipling felt getting this from the San Francisco Examiner in 1889: "I'm sorry, Mr. Kipling, but you just don't know how to use the English language." 
My favorite is this one: "My dear fellow, I may perhaps be dead from the neck up, but rack my brains as I may I can't see why a chap should need thirty pages to describe how he turns over in bed before going to sleep." 
That was Marc Humblot, French editor, in a rejection note to Marcel Proust in 1912. 

   Will authors, impaled on the ends of critics' pens, find comfort reading these things? 
Probably not. 
Perhaps it's better they adopt a philosophical attitude -- several splendid ones can be found in the back of "Rotten Reviews" in quotes from authors about book reviewing. 
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s, for example: "I have long felt that any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. 
He or she is like a person who has just put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae or banana split." 
Or Andre Gide's: "A unanimous chorus of approval is not an assurance of survival; authors who please everyone at once are quickly exhausted." 

   But I believe this one by E.M. Forster is the truest: "Some reviews give pain. 
This is regrettable, but no author has the right to whine. 
He was not obliged to be an author. 
He invited publicity, and he must take the publicity that comes along."

Behind the Glamour Girl's Mask
---
By James Reginato</HL>
<DD> 05/29/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   When Leland Hayward and his wife, now Lady Nancy Keith, divorced, their settlement included a division of turf at El Morocco. 
He had to stick to one side of the fabled nightclub's main room, she to the other. 
That was the kind of world in which lived Brenda Frazier, when, for a time, she was the most famous girl alive. 
In the six months preceding her debut in December of 1938, the press somehow singled her out from among the legions of her debut-bound peers and anointed her "Glamour Girl No. 1"; Super-Deb. 

   Five-thousand articles appeared about Brenda in half a year, everywhere from the Saginaw News to Life Magazine, whose cover she adorned. 
Even the Daily Worker wrote about her (under the headline "$8 Million Glamour Girl Has Serious Side -- Once Read a Book"). 
Her every move was documented; a perfume, Sarong, was created in her honor; she endorsed Studebakers (though she didn't drive); her "look" -- translucent white skin, deep red lips, and dark hair with prominent widow's peak -- became the rage. 

   While the ostensible subject of "Debutante: The Story of Brenda Frazier" (Knopf, 331 pages, $19.95) is the quick rise and long, long fall of the girl herself, its author, journalist Gioia Diliberto, is as much concerned with the phenomenon of Brenda's incredible, inexplicable fame: the press that created it, the public that consumed it. 

   Enterprising reporters managed to build entire articles around the girl's new hairdo or her tired feet ("I love it. 
But golly, my feet hurt! -- a tea dance this afternoon, out again tonight, then dancing later," she told America). 
Brenda would never have risen into the view of the nation's intrepid reporters, however, without two powerful engines: her social-climbing mother and grandmother, who mercilessly programmed her social calendar. 
When Brenda was feeling ill, which was often, her mother would march into her bedroom and say "You're going out; you're going to El Morocco and the Stork Club. 
Get up. 
You're just pretending to be sick." 

   Brenda wasn't truly beautiful, but, thanks to her elders' efforts, she became dazzling: by age 13 (when she had her own French lady's maid and could be spotted waltzing until dawn at the St. Regis in floor-length pink chiffon, heavy makeup and expensive jewels), Brenda was spending more time on manicures, pedicures, coiffures and fittings, than at school. 
But as her mother said: "You do not become a grande dame in society by playing the piano or painting seriously." 

   Mother Frazier pulled all the stops to orchestrate a debut for Brenda grand and gaudy enough to be a deification. 
And, by all accounts, she succeeded. 
The party, at New York's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, drew 1,400 top-drawer swells and generated as much press as a coronation. 
President Roosevelt's niece came out at the White House the same evening, but the next day the San Francisco Chronicle's banner headline read: "BRENDA IS FINALLY OUT, NOW WE CAN ALL RELAX." 

   Ms. Diliberto attempts to explain this baffling celebrity -- which puzzled even the reporters who created it -- and traces it to the Depression era's consuming hunger for escapism. 
This explanation seems incomplete, however, when one reads how astoundingly dull the girl really was: "Brenda's typical day that year began at noon. 
Lying in bed, drinking the coffee brought to her by Slater, she would phone her friends. 
Later, she'd lunch at an expensive restaurant, usually having three shrimp and a glass of brandy champagne." 

   As meticulously as Ms. Diliberto charts Brenda's social ascent, so does she chronicle her descent, which began promptly after her first marriage, in 1941. 
After Pearl Harbor, debutantes and the rest of the idle rich slid out of fashion. 
Obsolete, then, at 21, Brenda filled her many declining years by drifting through marriages and affairs, and into alcoholism, anorexia, bulimia, suicide attempts (30 of them; wrist-slitting was her favored method -- her arms looked like railroad tracks), and drug addiction. 
To her dying day, however, she retained a clipping service, to make sure she wouldn't miss any stories about herself. 

   The end was truly ghoulish. 
As her life deteriorated, she remained ever more devoted to the care and application of her "Glamour Girl Mask," which took hours to prepare and involved foundation, "several powderpuff-fuls of rice powder mixed with cornstarch which gave her the patina of a Kabuki dancer," false eyelashes, liver-red lipstick, and a black velvet stick-on beauty mark. 
"As Brenda's life grew darker, the mask grew whiter," observes Ms. Diliberto. 

   She records the gory details unflinchingly: "On top of her bed were clouds of lacy pillows and flowered cotton sheets, which Brenda always covered with plastic before eating dinner or slitting her wrists." 

   Readers at this point may wonder if "Debutante" isn't really a long-lost Edgar Allan Poe story. 
But did Poe ever write anything this scary?

<HEAD>Panel Urges Federal Quarantine for Infested Grove Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAKE ALFRED, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A citrus industry committee on Friday
asked state and federal authorities to impose a quarantine and
fruit shipping restrictions around a grove infested with a virulent
strain of citrus canker.
   The quarantine would establish a strict inspection and
eradication program and restrict marketing of fruit from the grove
owned by Florida Citrus Commissioner Ed Smoak.
   Canker is a bacterial disease that could spread and devastate
Florida's billion-dollar citrus industry, scientists say.
   Steve Poe, a scientist representing the U.S. Department of
Agriculture on the committee investigating the canker infestation,
said the agency may impose a quarantine within the next two weeks.
   But the U.S. Department of Agriculture won't rush because the
400-acre grove is isolated and not productive, so the disease is
unlikey to spread to Florida's 700,000 acres of commercial groves.
   ``That's one reason we're taking our time on this,'' Poe said.
``It's really pretty sparsely inhabited and only a total of about
55 acres are in production in there.''
   The Asiatic or A-strain of the disease blemishes and blisters
tree stems, leaves and fruit.
   Other citrus-producing states like Texas, California and Arizona
rely on federal shipping embargoes and quarantines to keep the
disease from spreading into their groves.
   The outbreak has tentatively been traced to another small
infestation discovered elsewhere in Florida in 1986.
   State agriculture officials believe a former employee of the
canker-eradication program took infected material to his home near
the Smoak grove.
   Leon Hebb, acting director of the state's canker eradication
program, said the man may have taken the infected material for
private research.
   Poe said the USDA was working with state investigators to
determine if the man caused the infestation.
   ``It's a real detective story,'' Poe said. ``We're doing
everything to trace the whole thing down.''

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: All hail the high prince of horror - Nigel Andrews
pays tribute to the actor Vincent Price, who died this week aged 82
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tingler, The Pit And The Pendulum, The Raven, Theatre Of Blood . . .
Vincent Price, prince of darkness, is dead. Who can resist the ritualistic
mourning incantation? - 'Horror cinema will never be the same without him.'
But of course horror cinema was never the same with him. Never the same from
movie to movie - when would this gaunt actor-chameleon put on his
sepulchral-serious colours and when his self-spoofing motley? And never the
same, seen historically, in the post-war Price heyday as it was in the
earlier era of Lon Chaney or Boris Karloff.
Almost single-handedly Vincent Price created a new realm of Gothic cinema:
one where stomping monsters gave way to silken aristocrats, monochrome (and
often monotone) mayhem to a richly-coloured Romanticism sometimes curdling
into camp.
His best movies were the series of Poe-based films made with director Roger
Corman. Here the damask snarl of a voice - Missouri-southern mixed with
stage-trained Shakespearean elocution - gave us the beat of Poe's taunting,
haunting prose. And the patrician-bloodhound face summoned up all those Poe
aristos, marooned in their mansions as troublesome guests dropped by. 'That
noise, sir? Just my sister trying to emerge from her resting place. That
scream, sir . . . ?'
The only time I ever met Price, it was in his pink-washed villa halfway up
the Hollywood Hills. He already looked frail from long illness. But he
talked for an hour; showed me round his art collection (he has written books
on painting and was once reported to be the highest-paid art lecturer in
America); and rolled out his career history for me like a red carpet.
He was a living half-century chronicle of Hollywood. After early stage
experience with, among others, Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre, he came to
screen fame in the late 1930s as Sir Walter Raleigh to Bette Davis's Queen
Elizabeth I. Then he spent the next two decades working for a connoisseur
series of Mad Directors, including Otto Preminger (Laura, 1943) and Cecil B
DeMille (The Ten Commandments, 1956). DeMille was his favourite: probably
because, like a good horror director, CB expected other people's imagination
to work along with his own.
'He never had a script,' says Price. 'He'd have a Bible on his desk and that
was the script]' The film's visuals were not always
quick-off-the-drawing-board either. 'In The Ten Commandments I had a line to
Sir Cedric Hardwicke, who was playing the Pharaoh and I said, 'Yonder lies
the city of Seti's glory]' And behind us there was this great blank
cyclorama which they'd superimpose the photograph on later. And DeMille
pulled me over and said, 'Vincent, you don't read that line with much
conviction.' And I said, 'Mr DeMille, I don't know what I'm talking about] I
look out there and all I see is a great blue screen.'
'He said, 'You're right, come with me to the studio.' And he showed me what
was going to be superimposed - temples, giant tombs and 13,000 slaves
walking up the Valley of the Kings pulling an obelisk] It was the most
extraordinary thing you ever saw in your life. I went back and read the line
a little more convincingly.'
But not - see the film today - all that convincingly. Price never seemed
wholly comfortable in either ancient or modern clothes. He was to find his
identity in between: in those fin de siecle, quasi-Victorian villains that
came his way after DeMille, multiplying like a benevolent plague in the 60s
and 70s.
'You've really made it in Hollywood when you're typecast,' he says. 'You
haven't made it until they say 'Oh he's the actor to play that kind of part,
let's hire him.' So they hired Price. Again and again. His novelty value was
that he was the suavest, most cultured 'heavy' in the history of screen
Gothic.
'I think Aristotle's theory of the villain is correct. He said the villain
should be a high-born, highly educated, very erudite man. Because if he has
to pay for his sins, we hoi polloi understand that we must pay for ours.
I've always tried to give my characters that kind of elegance.'
Different directors, though, had different uses for the Price charisma. For
years he was pulled two ways by two contrasting auteurs: William Castle, of
The Tingler and House On Haunted Hill, and Roger Corman.
'Bill Castle was a showman. He'd strew his movies, and his theatres, with
these outsize gimmicks. For The Tingler, he wired up the seats with little
buzzers so audiences would get shocked at key moments. And he sent the
actual tingler, which was like a kind of lobster, on a string round the
auditorium]'
Corman was ascetic by comparison. He steered Price through the incomparable
Poe films, poised between refined camp and psychoanalytic fable. 'Roger's a
very erudite man. He used to give Karloff and Peter Lorre and me directions
on how Jung would have approached this or Freud that, and he'd quote from a
book by Krafft-Ebing, and we'd say 'Yes, Roger, but how do we do the
scene?''
The Corman movies gave us the Price we know, and the Price we know gave us
hours of enjoyment screaming away in the darkened stalls. Did he think it is
innocent enjoyment?
'I've been asked a lot about this. You know, 'Is it harmful to our
children?' Well, it's not as harmful as the things that are harmful, which
we can see on every street corner. Horror is a kind of escape. It happens
when you're very young. Your favourite stories are Bluebeard and
Rumpelstiltskin, which are terrifying stories. We start early loving to be
frightened. 'Boo]' is probably the first word children react to, and they do
all their life.
'I've had people come up to me, people my age in their eighties, and say 'I
remember being frightened to death and holding hands with my boyfriend or
girlfriend.' And it's true: there's a kind of intimacy that's brought about
by adventure, and by adventures in evil.'

<TEXT>
   A jury Wednesday ordered 10 years'
probation and a $5,000 fine for a man whose lion mauled a girl at a
flea market, and a judge barred him from contact with exotic
animals and children.
   State District Judge Ted Poe said in augmenting the jury's
sentence that it was Gary Durkovitz's fault that Roxanne Hernandez
``is going to bear the bite of a lion for the rest of her life.''
   ``Society needs to realize that certain creatures don't belong
near the city, near the public where they can hurt little girls.
... I wanted to make sure he never forgot that,'' Poe said.
   Durkovitz, 35, whose 350-pound pet lion, Samson, attacked the
8-year-old girl at a flea market in Houston on Oct. 10, was
convicted last week of injury to a child.
   The lion tried to put the girl's head in its mouth and bit off
part of her skull, exposing part of the brain. The girl has
undergone reconstructive surgery and faces more operations.
   After the jury ordered the probation and fine, Poe imposed
further restrictions, ordering Durkovitz to get rid of all his
exotic animals, to stay away from children and to serve 30 days in
Harris County Jail.
   Since the attack, Durkovitz has been jailed on two charges of
indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a
child. The cases, which are pending, stem from his allegedly using
the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys, prosecutors said.
   Poe also ordered Durkovitz to do 20 hours of community service
work each month with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and said he would have to approve any of Durkovitz's future
jobs.
   Defense attorney Robert Scardino said he would appeal the
verdict.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Alice Brown, who had
asked for the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $5,000
fine, said she was not disappointed about the sentence.
   Durkovitz was walking the lion out of the flea market on a chain
leash when it attacked Roxanne as she walked in front of it.
   The girl's mother, Sonia Hernandez, testified the girl had to
wear a wig or cap in public and had trouble concentrating.
   The lion was shot as it was attacking the girl and was destroyed
later.
   Durkovitz, who testified he had taken every measure to prevent
an attack, also faces a civil lawsuit in the case.

<HEAD>Lawyer Who Ditched Plane Over Atlantic Faces FCC Disbarment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington attorney who ditched his plane
in the Atlantic Ocean last summer has been ordered to show why he
shouldn't be disbarred from practicing before the Federal
Communications Commission.
   In the meantime, Thomas L. Root has been suspended from
practicing law before the commission, the FCC said Friday.
   The commission said it took the action because the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia entered an order April 12
disbarring Root by consent. FCC rules require that attorneys
practicing before it not be under any disbarment order.
   Telephone calls to Root's office Friday went unanswered.
   In March, Root was indicted on 33 counts of fraud and other
crimes involving radio stations he was representing before the FCC.
   The federal indictment accused Root of defrauding the government
and five clients in FCC proceedings on permits to construct FM
radio stations throughout the United States.
   Root gained notoriety last July when his single-engine plane ran
out of fuel and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas following
a six-hour, 800-mile flight that began near Washington.
   He told authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the
odyssey, but Navy fighter pilots flying alongside the plane
reported seeing him move in the cockpit.
   When he was taken to a Florida hospital, Root was found to have
suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
   Less than a week after the crash, Sonrise Management Services of
Columbus, Ga., sued Root for $584,000, claiming he failed to
perform work and double-billed a client.
   Root filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors in
October 1989, claiming he had $1.64 million in liabilities.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf: Toasting the Glory Days of Guzzling </HL>
<AUTHOR> Dave Shiflett </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Tastes great! 

   Less filling! 

   So goes the epic drinking debate at the end of the 20th century, and a thin dispute it is. 
Back in the weightier 1500s, Rabelais asked, "Which came first: thirst or drinking?" then proceeded to turn his belly into a bulging wine sack. 
A great man, a great talent, but maybe it's a good thing the maestro isn't around today. 
Truth told, the glory days of guzzling probably are far behind us. 

   That's one reading of Joan and John Digby's fine anthology, "Inspired by Drink: An Anthology" (Morrow, 459 pages, $24.95). A sad story it is, told by the likes of Homer, Hemingway, Chekhov, Hardy, Coleridge, Burns, Dickens, Baudelaire, Pushkin, Milton, Shakespeare and scores of others. In condensed form, it goes something like this:
   Back in the days before drinkers were heaped in with crack addicts and other drug fiends, they were a proud and defiant people. 
In fact, drinkers were rather intolerant of the puff-chested drys. 
Japanese poet Otomo Tabito (655-731) spoke for the age when he said: O what an ugly sight/The man who thinks he's wise/And never drinks sake!/Give him a good look -- How like an ape he is!" 

   The Greek poet Anacreon (582?-485 B.C.), somehow aware that his words would never come back to haunt him in a Senate confirmation hearing, was even more enthusiastic: "See! see! the jolly god appears/His hand a mighty goblet bears/With sparkling wine full charg'd it flows/The sovereign cure of human woes." (Our own national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner," is set to the music of an old drinking song titled "Anacreon in Heaven.") 

   Po Chu-i's "Better Come Drink With Me," a ninth-century classic, is intoxicating; had Carrie Nation read it she might have lived out her days sipping gin atop a steam grate. 

   But as time passed, the bottle busters, who have always been with us, seemed to gain the upper hand. 
"Buddha taught that a man who takes liquor and forces another to drink will be reborn five hundred times without hands," Kenko Yoshida had warned back in the 14th century. 
By and by, he was taken seriously. 
Everything turned to vinegar. 

   Whereas wine drinking had once led lads and lassies to sublime reveries, now we find Fortunado (in Edgar Allen Poe's "The Cask of Amontillado") chasing the grape into a niter-dripping catacomb, where he was shackled, walled up and left to ferment into a pile of dust. Mr. Poe (in whose destruction the grape also played a part) wasn't the only one to hang a lei of gin blossoms around Bacchus's neck: There is for example, Bertolt Brecht's description of a grog seller:
   "And his body heaves, he writhes there groaning
   Cold sweat smears his forehead like slime
   While his spongelike brain there enter
   Nightmare figures as in pantomine." 

   Modern literature is brimming with bad hooch. 
Seldom do you hear the celebratory voice of a John Clare (1793-1864), who uplifted the hearts of many when he wrote: "We'd sooner suck ale through a blanket/Than thimbles of wine from a glass." 
Instead there are Hemingway's sad drunks, and Fitzgerald's alcoholic crack-ups. 

   As "Inspired by Drink" makes clear, the modern world thirsts for affirmative voices. 
Today's best known beer advocate is a dog -- Spuds McKenzie -- and an ugly dog at that. 
And we do have Bartles and Jaymes, but they're paid psalmists for the wine cooler, a vile concoction serious drinkers consult only after they've gone through hair tonic and windshield deicer. 

   Only a few brave voices stir. 
Tom O'Grady, a poet/wine maker from the Old Dominion, writes sonnets about the Great Grape and had a minor hit a few years back with "Sitting Under a Picture of Robert E. Lee in a Small Bar Somewhere in the South of Virginia." 
But such enthusiasms are rare. 

   None of this is meant to discount the value of the cautionary tale, which is well represented in this anthology. 
In fact, parents might have their adolescents read the book to get an idea of the variety of experiences drinking provides. 
There are potent tales to be told, of poor creatures who awoke, post-binge, in a strange hedgerow, only to exclaim, "Hallo! 
What's this? 
A knife wound?" 
Or about the sop who peered up from a drunk-tank bunk to find a cellmate swinging from a pantleg noose. 

   Yet, as "Inspired by Drink" also reminds us, alcohol warmed Christ's belly, lightens the mourner's burden, and has sponsored countless hours of fellowship during the grim history of our fractious species. 
Those who busy themselves turning wine back into water go too far. 
There's a middle ground. 
Or as Pascal said: "No Wine, no wisdom/Too much wine -- the same." 

   ---
   Mr. Shiflett takes an occasional nip in Vienna, Va.

CRITIC AT LARGE: MURDER, THEY WRITE -- A GATHERING OF THE GENRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a room full of murderous thoughts, but you'd never have known it to look 
about you. The auditorium at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice on 
Manhattan's West Side contained some 200 present and future writers of crime 
fiction, come to hear a symposium on physical evidence. To a person, they were 
making furious notes that will undoubtedly shape the creation of tomorrow's 
vile deeds. 
</P>
<P>
The witness included author William Caunitz ("Black Sand"), who before he took 
up writing was for 29 years a high-ranking New York Police Department officer; 
Lt. Frank Bunting, a 20-year narcotics detective with the department; and 
Lawrence Kobilinsky, who is an expert on DNA "fingerprinting." The DNA work, 
already the subject of a book by Joseph Wambaugh, is the hot news in forensic 
medicine. Judging from all the note-taking and question-asking, it will be soon 
be harder to escape in crime fiction than red herrings. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium was a feature of the annual gathering of the 2,500-member Mystery 
Writers of America, who met this time in an atmosphere of ebullient 
satisfaction. Measured by sales of both new and reprinted works (the mystery 
past is being ransacked), and by other symptoms, like the popularity of 
"Murder, She Wrote," there seems clearly a resurgence of interest in the form, 
which has never quite been out of fashion but rarely been chic. 
</P>
<P>
The late eminent literary critic Edmund Wilson once wrote a snarling essay 
called "Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?" a slighting reference to one of 
Dame Agatha Christie's earliest and most controversial works, about whose 
denouement cries of "Dirty pool!" are still heard. But the equally eminent poet 
W. H. Auden countered with a celebration of the mystery form called "The Guilty 
Vicarage," evening the score so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
The danger facing the form at the moment may not be overt hostility but a 
smothering and dissecting interest from the academic community, which is 
subjecting crime fiction to various forms of analysis, from Marxist to 
semiotics. 
</P>
<P>
But the mystery writers go about their work rather serenely indifferent to 
these academic flurries. Possibly inspired by the model of Dame Agatha herself, 
a sturdy grandmother figure surely more at home among primroses than police 
procedures, the writers are as benevolent-looking a group as you could hope to 
find this side of the Chelsea Flower Show. (Given the ruthless competition 
amongst hybridizers, possibly even more benevolent.) 
</P>
<P>
On the evidence of the turnout for the group's annual Edgar Awards dinner 
Thursday night -- the awards named, naturally, for Edgar Allan Poe, the 
acknowledged procreator of the modern detective story -- the mysterians are 
predominantly female, in their early to middle years. 
</P>
<P>
Why the writers, except for the occasional sporty and raffish exception, should 
appear so uniformly kindly, men and women alike, is good question. It may be 
because they are able to exorcise their lethal angers and frustrations by 
putting them down on paper. The rages that others harbor, gnawing at their 
innards like concealed foxes, the crime-writers can assign to the bad guys or 
the good persons (who are able to vent their spleens in ways denied to lesser 
humans). 
</P>
<P>
One says good persons these days, because there is a rising trend toward female 
operatives, not just the amateur sleuths in the folksy tradition of Jane 
Marples, but private eyes, like Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshinsky, who can take 
a punch as well as Lew Archer ever could, and unmask and unhand the villain 
with equal knightly flair. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of crime fiction is, as ever, primarily escapist -- an antidote to 
insomnia, worldly cares and the tedium of travel. But, as the work of this 
year's Edgar winners suggests, the field is not easy to summarize. It ranges 
form the traditional "cozies" (set in small towns with a tight cast of 
suspects) to more exotic situations. 
</P>
<P>
Present stories offer moral ambiguities and sexual and linguistic candor 
eschewed in classic crime fiction. The best writing offers a background of 
well-observed social history that in decades to come will give accurate clues 
to the way we lived now. 
</P>
<P>
This year's top winner, appropriate to a year of glasnost, was Stuart M. 
Kaminsky's "A Cold Red Sunrise," one of his series featuring a Moscow 
policeman. It was chosen from more than 200 entries. 
</P>
<P>
The eagerly sought and career-launching Edgar for the best first mystery by an 
American writer went to "Caroline Skeletons" by David Stout. The best paperback 
original was Timothy Findley's "The Telling of Lies." There were 93 entries in 
the category, a measure of activity in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Winner for the best factual book on crime was "In Broad Daylight" by Harry 
Mclean, about the murder of an unpopular man in a Missouri town, a crime that 
has gone unpublished because none of the four dozen eyewitnesses would testify. 
</P>
<P>
The Edgar for best biographical or critical study went to Francis M. Nevins Jr. 
for his exhaustive book, "Cornell Woolrich: First You Dream, Then You Die." An 
Edgar for best movie went to Errol Morris for his documentary, "The Thin Blue 
Line," which was instrumental in the freeing of an unjustly convicted man after 
he had spent more than a dozen years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The television honors went to a feature, "Man Against the Mob," written by 
David J. Kinghorn and shown on NBC, and to "The Devil's Foot," an episode from 
the PBS Mystery! series, "The Return of Sherlock Holmes." 
</P>
<P>
A special Ellery Queen Award went to the partnership of William Link and the 
late Richard Levinson for their body of work, which included the creation of 
"Columbo" and "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
The Mystery Writers highest honor, the Grandmaster Award, went to the veteran 
Hillary Waugh, whose classic thriller, "Last Seen Wearing . . ." has twice been 
included on lists of the 100 best crime novels of all time. 
</P>
<P>
As banquets go, Thursday night's could have used more mystery and suspense and 
somewhat better plotting. But it was congenial and, above all, benevolent.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: ON THE STAGE, AN APRIL FILLED WITH SPRING OPENINGS

Passover gets the performance treatment at Highways in Santa Monica on April 
10, when the traditional Seder will be celebrated with a mix of old and new 
ritual: readings from the Haggada both ancient and feminist, Middle 
East-inspired food, performance and music -- on the flute, guitar and 
saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
(The Seder is a religious meal accompanied by the retelling of the Jews' escape 
from Egypt; the Haggada is the biblical narrative.) "Not all of us are Jewish," 
said Robin Podolsky, one of the seven people who assembled the evening. "And 
within those of us who are Jewish, there's a real range. For instance, I'm 
quite secular; my spiritual practice is as eclectic as you can get. Malcolm 
Boyd knows more about liturgy than anyone. And Brian Zeiden is a student of 
religion -- and quite observant." 
</P>
<P>
The unifying intent, she added, "was to consciously re-create the link between 
theater and ritual. For a lot of us, there's a memory and affinity for the 
ritual of Seder -- sitting around the table as a child -- and wanting to say, 
'This is what we do in our lives: tell stories to make sense of the world.' As 
critical thinkers, we try to take those stories apart. As actors we try to put 
the magic back, albeit informed with understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The seven, who for the most part are either gay, lesbian or people with AIDS, 
have also sought to include the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 
inviting a dozen Middle Eastern artists to participate. "The story of the Seder 
is the narrative thread that pulls the evening together," Podolsky said. 
Participants are asked to provide an offering: a music performance or symbolic 
reading, food (only unleavened bread will do) or goods such as candles and 
incense. Admission is $5. 
</P>
<P>
