   PHILADELPHIA -- The latest TV ad for appointed Sen. Harris
Wofford, the Democratic underdog in next month's Senate
election in Pennsylvania, blisters GOP opponent Dick
Thornburgh's record as U.S. attorney general.
   The ad blasts Mr. Thornburgh for dereliction in
investigating the scandal-ridden Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce
International. It attacks him for failure to track down money
stolen in the savings-and-loan scandals. It slams him for a
conflict of interest in refusing to appoint a special
prosecutor to examine the role of Neil Bush, the president's
son, as director of a failed S&amp;L.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Thornburgh's strategists have a new negative attack on
Mr. Wofford, too. It's a commencement speech Mr. Wofford
delivered 23 years ago at Webster University, in St. Louis,
in which he said that "clearly the education women need is to
be good amateurs . . . {education} that will help them choose
their husbands well."
   Mr. Wofford's canny handlers aren't impressed. "Who
cares?" says one.
   In a campaign the Republicans are desperate to win, Mr.
Thornburgh, a two-term former governor, remains the favorite.
But Mr. Wofford, a cerebral Democrat who has been the
president of two universities, is making a race of it --
thanks largely to a tough band of guerrilla campaigners led
by senior strategist James Carville and his deputy, Paul
Begala, and by media consultants Robert Shrum and David Doak.
   "This is fun," says Mr. Carville, a striking figure in
pinstriped downtown Philadelphia in his trademark skintight
blue jeans. "It's like getting a free kick in a soccer game."
   In the end, win or lose, Mr. Wofford and his supporters
hope they will have given disheartened national Democrats an
inkling of how they might challenge George Bush in next
year's presidential race.
   Two key lessons for Democrats emerge from the Keystone
state, which hasn't elected a Democratic senator since 1962:
   -- Take the fight to the opposition. Put them on the
defensive. And, when they attack, hit back, fast.
   -- And when discussing the issues, emphasize working-class
and middle-class concerns. Play down programs aimed to
benefit the very poor.
   From the start, the Wofford campaign lobbed one grenade
after another into the lethargic Thornburgh camp. Mr.
Wofford's strategists charged that Mr. Thornburgh after
leaving the Justice Department accepted a "sweetheart deal"
with a Pittsburgh law firm that pays him $1,000 a week for
doing nothing. Then they recruited what seemed to be every
senior-citizens organization in the state to say that a
Thornburgh ad touting his record helping older people was
riddled with inaccuracies. Mr. Thornburgh's camp -- the
candidate himself isn't giving any interviews -- denied the
charges in both situations.
   Mr. Carville and others pounded away at what they say are
major shifts in Mr. Thornburgh's stand on important issues.
"Once he opposed the death penalty," says Mr. Carville. "Now
he favors it for jaywalking."
   In the midst of it, Mr. Thornburgh's campaign manager,
Michele Davis, was quoted in every media outlet in the state
as saying that Mr. Thornburgh, when elected, would be the
"salvation" of this "sorryassed state." The Wofford team had
a field day with that one.
   The early GOP strategy was singleminded -- to remind
voters that Mr. Thornburgh, as governor from 1979 to 1987,
held the line on taxes and spending. That plays off against
voters' resentment at tax increases imposed by Democratic
Gov. Robert Casey, who named Mr. Wofford as interim senator
to fill the vacancy created by the death of Republican Sen.
John Heinz in an airplane crash last April. The winner of the
special election on Nov. 5 -- the only Senate election in the
country this year -- will serve the remaining three years of
Mr. Heinz's term.
   "They did have us reacting," says Ms. Davis, Mr.
Thornburgh's campaign manager. But now, working with media
consultant Greg Ste- vens, an associate of Bush media adviser
Roger Ailes, the Thornburgh machine is lurching into action
with negative ads attacking Mr. Wofford.
   Their first negative ad, aired this week, charges that Mr.
Wofford, as state Democratic chairman in 1986, "presided over
one of the most negative campaigns ever." That was the year
Mr. Carville made his mark here. His candidate, Mr. Casey,
defeated Republican William Scranton Jr. with the help of a
TV ad showing old photos of a long-haired Mr. Scranton in the
days when he was a marijuana-smoking hippie. The Thornburgh
ad also charges that Mr. Wofford ran big deficits when he was
president of Bryn Mawr College (Mr. Wofford says that, in
fact, he put the college back on the path toward fiscal
solvency).
   The biggest problem for the Wofford campaign is that Mr.
Thornburgh is a familiar figure to almost everyone in
Pennsylvania. His opponents argue he is arrogant and aloof,
but on the campaign trail he is warm and folksy. Mr. Wofford
remains an unknown quantity to most Pennsylvanians still
struggling to pronounce his name correctly (it rhymes with
offered). On the stump, he is frequently awkward and
discursive.
   With the help of President Bush, Vice President Quayle and
members of the cabinet, Mr. Thornburgh will be able to spend
just about any sum he thinks necessary to win this race. The
Wofford campaign is always strapped for cash.
   For all the negative advertising, there are some positive
aspects of this campaign. Mr. Thornburgh has proposed federal
initiatives to rehabilitate the abandoned factories that dot
this old industrial state, to establish enterprise zones that
would provide new jobs in distressed neighborhoods and to
supply assistance to small businesses to attend overseas
trade fairs.
   As for Mr. Wofford, he has discovered health care as a
hot-button issue in a state where more than one-third of the
voters are 60 years of age or older. "People in Washington,"
he says, "are beginning to understand that Americans are
ready, finally, for a nationalized health-care system." Mr.
Wofford's most successful positive TV ad says, "If criminals
have the right to a lawyer, I think working Americans have
the right to a doctor."
   Mr. Wofford also receives a positive response to his ads
and speeches attacking special trade agreements with places
like China and Mexico. If the agreement with Mexico passes,
he says jobs will be lost in Pennsylvania, which has already
been pummeled by bad times. In a kicker his strategists say
could be used nationally, Mr. Wofford, who helped found the
Peace Corps more than 30 years ago, argues, "I think it's
time for America to help Americans for a change. It's time to
take care of our own."
   Mr. Wofford is targeting his campaign at working-class and
middle-class voters who have tended to abandon the Democratic
Party because of their concerns that it no longer cares
enough about their problems.
   "I believe our party has let itself get too deeply
involved in targeting programs for the very poor," says Mr.
Wofford. The other side of the coin, he argues, is that Mr.
Thornburgh, once widely perceived as a moderate, has moved to
the right in a party "that favors the rich and powerful."
   Mr. Carville never passes up a chance to note that Mr.
Thornburgh has boasted of his familiarity with the "corridors
of power" in Washington. "What's that mean, he bounced some
checks?" says Mr. Carville.
   "Wofford's making inroads by coming across as the
challenger in this race," says G. Terry Madonna, a political
scientist at Millersville State University. "I think it's
going to be very close."

   What was intended to be a simple gesture of
international friendship has turned into a source of embarrassment
for Missouri highway and economic development officials.
   The multilingual sign they erected outside St. Louis' Lambert
Airport to welcome foreign visitors was botched, in three of seven
languages.
   ``Their intentions were definitely good, and I can understand
how these things happen, but they should have consulted a
dictionary,'' said Antonio M. Molina of suburban University City.
   Molina said the Spanish welcome _ ``Bienvendos a Missouri'' _
should have read ``Bienvenidos a Missouri.'' Molina should know _
his father, the late Jose Molina, was the honorary vice consul from
Spain, and his great-uncle, Jose Alvarez, held the post before him.
   The German and French salutations also were misspelled or
grammatically incorrect. ``Wilkommen in Missouri'' should have read
``Willkommen in Missouri,'' according to James McLeod, professor of
German at Washington University.
   The French version, ``Bienvenue a Missouri,'' should read
``Bienvenue en Missouri.''
   ``The preposition is wrong. People arriving here from France
would laugh at the sign,'' said Jacques Chicoineau, a retired
professor of foreign languages at Webster University.
   The greetings in Japanese, Chinese and Korean were perfect,
however. Oh yes, they also got the English greeting right.
   Jacque Dunn, director of public affairs for the state's
department of economic development, said her office was
reconfirming the translations. Dunn said the translations had been
made with the help of the department's offices overseas.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Activist Killed Outside His Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white anti-apartheid
activist was shot and killed Monday outside his home by an
assailant firing from a passing car, police said.
   Colleagues said they had no doubt that David Webster, 44, was
assassinated because of his political activities.
   Webster, a lecturer in social anthropology at the University of
the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a prominent member of several
anti-apartheid organizations, was a leading opponent of the
government's policy of detention without trial and held periodic
tea parties for the families of detained black activists.
   Police said Webster died almost instantly after he was hit in
the back by a bullet fired from a heavy-caliber weapon outside his
home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Troyeville. Nothing was
known about the assailant, police added
   With Webster at the time was Maggie Friedman, a friend and
fellow member of the Human Rights Commission, a Johannesburg-based
monitoring group established by anti-apartheid activists last year.
She said Webster was shot after they had returned from buying
plants at a nursery.
   She said she heard a noise from a passing car which she thought
had backfired, then saw Webster stagger and tell her: ``I've been
shot with a shotgun. Get an ambulance.''
   ``It is clear to me that his killing was a highly professional
job,'' she said. ``I find it frightening that those who opposed him
were prepared to go to such lengths to eliminate someone.''
   Dozens of black activists have been killed in recent years in
unsolved murders. The Five Freedoms Forum, a human rights groups
with which Webster worked, described Monday's killing as one of the
first assassinations of a white activist.
   ``We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of our
dear comrade,'' said Mohammed Valli Moosa, a former detainee who
serves as unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups.
   ``We are concerned that his death comes as a result of
unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid,'' Valli Moosa
said. ``The only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an
interest in perpetuating this evil system.''

   An anti-apartheid activist was
assassinated outside his home just days after completing a report
contending death squads are stalking government opponents, his
editor said Tuesday.
   David Webster, a university lecturer, was shot in the chest
Monday by an assailant who fired a shotgun from a passing car,
police said Tuesday. Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said
doctors removed 16 pellets from Webster's body.
   Police offered a $4,000 reward for information leading to the
killers and released sketches of three unidentified white male
suspects.
   Glenn Moss, co-editor of South African Review, said an article
by Webster and a close friend, Maggie Friedman, was to appear in
the political journal's next edition in August.
   ``Assassinations are used as one of the methods of controlling
government opposition when all other methods such as detention or
intimidation have failed,'' the article says. ``It is a very rare
event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved.
   ``The past 12 months have witnessed a steady tempo of
kidnappings and assassinations of anti-apartheid activists ...
carried out by clandestine groups, presumably a death squad.''
   Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the white activist's
slaying came from blacks and whites, and from anti-apartheid,
academic, labor and student groups. Flags were flown at half-staff
Tuesday at the University of the Witwatersrand where Webster, 44,
taught anthropology.
   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster against race
discrimination, told hundreds of mourners at the Johannesburg
campus Monday night: ``There is only one group that stood to gain
from this act: those who are dedicated to perpetuating the brutal
and vicious system that David dedicated his life to opposing.''
   A statement in London from the African National Congress
guerrilla movement said Webster's death is ``the latest in a long
chain of such acts carried out by supporters of the apartheid
regime, determined to silence their opponents by whatever means.''
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said Webster ``was
not just a sympathizer in our struggle: he was a friend, a comrade,
an active participant.''
   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent
years. Many white activists in South Africa receive anonymous
threats. But few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing
of political science lecturer Rick Turner.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said: ``I want to make it
clear on behalf of the government that the murder is strongly
condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to apprehend
those responsible.''
   But South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ``I would be
surprised if the assassins are apprehended.''
   In a statement from an Anglican Church meeting in Cyprus, Tutu
said it was ``yet another example of the methods used against those
who stand for justice in South Africa.''
   The South African Council of Churches said Webster's death ``has
tragically demonstrated the vulnerability of anti-apartheid
activists in South Africa, given the fact that those who murder
opponents of the apartheid system are never brought to book.''
   The banned Detainees' Parents Support Committee said of Webster:
``His work went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover
of darkness.''

   Colleagues of slain
anti-apartheid activist David Webster today offered a reward for
the arrest of his killers and advised police officials to look
within their own ranks for suspects.
   Webster, a university lecturer and outspoken critic of the
government's policy of detention without trial, was shot outside
his home Monday by an assailant in a passing car who fired a
shotgun from close range.
   Also today, six mortar bombs were fired at an army radar
installation near the border with Botswana, damaging living
quarters but causing no injuries.
   Regarding Webster, police have released sketches of three
unidentified white men suspected of involvement in the killing and
have offered a $4,000 reward for information leading to arrests.
   Today, the University of the Witwatersand, where Webster taught
anthropology, offered an additional $4,000 reward. Robert
Charleton, the chief administrator of the multiracial university,
said it was ``deeply disquieting'' that police had made no arrests
in connection with a series of previous attacks and vandalism aimed
at staff and students.
   Anti-apartheid activists who worked with Webster announced at a
news conference that his funeral would held Saturday.
   Max Coleman, a prominent human rights advocate, called for an
investigation into the possible existence of death squads formed to
kill government opponents.
   ``There may be no more profitable place to start such an
investigation than within the ranks of the police themselves,''
Coleman said. ``This is the body which has the expertise, the
information and the wherewithal to carry out such acts so
professionally.''
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a leader of the banned United Democratic
Front anti-apartheid coalition, told the news conference that
Webster ``was a very carefully chosen target.''
   ``His cold-blooded murder is meant to serve as a warning to the
increasing numbers of whites who are daring to associate themselves
in word and deed with the oppressed people of this country,'' Valli
Moosa said. ``We fear that more and more of our leaders are going
to be assassinated.''
   ``The ordinary people of this country have a strong suspicion
that Comrade Webster's assassin is a member of the police force,''
he added.
   Webster was an authority on the tactics used legally and
illegally to repress or intimidate government opponents. He
recently completed an article discussing unsolved abductions and
assassinations of anti-apartheid activists.
   Numerous black activists have been slain in recent years. Many
white activists have received anonymous threats or have been
harassed but few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing
of Rick Turner, a political scientist at the University of Natal.
   In north-central South Africa, security forces set off a land
mine while trying to catch those who fired the mortar bombs at the
radar installation, but the detonation of the mine caused no
injuries, the military said.
   It said the radar installation was near Mafikeng near the
Botswana border.
   There was no immediate indication who was responsible.
   There have been few attacks on army bases, and very few mortar
bombardments during the 28-year-old guerrilla campaign waged by the
outlawed African National Congress. South African officials have
contended that ANC guerrillas often infiltrate from Botswana to
carry out bombing and sabotage missions.

   Attackers firing from a
passing car today shot and killed anti-apartheid activist David
Webster outside his home, friends said.
   Police confirmed a white man was killed in a shooting incident
at Webster's home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Troyeville
but declined to release other details.
   Webster, 44, was a lecturer in social anthropology at the
University of the Witwatersrand and a prominent member of several
anti-apartheid organizations. He led campaigns against the
government's policy of detention without trial.
   Glenda, his former wife, told the independent South African
Press Association that Webster was opening the back door of a van
when shots were fired by men in a car. She said he had just
returned from buying plants at a nursery.
   Audrey Coleman, a colleague of Webster's and a fellow activist,
said she was certain the killing was politically motivated.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a former detainee now serving as
unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups, said in a
statement: ``We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of

   ``We are concerned that his death comes as a result of

   Police offered a $4,000 reward
today for information about the killing of a prominent white
anti-apartheid activist and the country's law and order minister
said he was horrified by the murder.
   Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the death of university
professor David Webster came from both blacks and whites, and from
anti-apartheid, academic, labor and student groups across South
Africa.
   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster in several organizations
opposed to race-segregation, told hundreds of mourners Monday night
at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ``There is
only one group that stood to gain from this act: those who are
dedicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that David
dedicated his life to opposing.''
   White musician Johnny Clegg, whose Zulu-style music has gained
international acceptance despite a cultural boycott against South
Africa, sent a message of support to the meeting from Los Angeles.
   Webster, 44, an anthropology lecturer at Witwatersrand, was shot
to death outside his Johannesburg home Monday by an assailant
firing from a passing car.
   Colleagues said they had no doubt he was killed because of his
political activities. He was a prominent opponent of detention
without trial.
   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent
years. Many white activists have received anonymous threats or have
been harassed by vandals, but few have been attacked.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a statement: ``I
want to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murder
is strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to
apprehend those responsible.''
   Tributes to Webster came from a wide range of organizations
opposed broadly to apartheid and specifically to various policies
of the white-led government. The groups assist families of
detainees, keep records of alleged human rights abuses, object to
military conscription and contest eviction of blacks from rented
houses.
   A spokesman for the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference
said Webster's life ``was one of great respect for the human
dignity of all people.''
   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, said the killing ``is a blow to our struggle but it
will only strengthen our determination to uproot and destroy
apartheid evils.''
   The Detainees Parents Support Committee, banned by the
government, said Webster became an authority on forms of state
repression and also patterns of informal repression. ``His work
went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover of
darkness,'' a statement said.
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

SLAIN APARTHEID FOE MOURNED IN PROTEST MARCH

<P>
A bespectacled anthropologist, David Webster, concluded a recent paper on
repression in South Africa by singling out the "steady tempo" of anti-apartheid
activists slain by right-wing death squads.
</P>
<P>
Webster said these clandestine groups control government opponents by
assassination after official methods, such as detention, have failed. "It is a
very rare event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, before that paper could even be published, about 5,000 white and
black South Africans marched through Johannesburg's white suburbs to bury
Webster, himself a victim of an assassination squad.
</P>
<P>
The gentle-mannered, 43-year-old white professor was killed outside his home
Monday by a single shotgun blast fired from a car carrying three white men. His
funeral march was one of the largest anti-apartheid processions here since the
government imposed a state of emergency three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Webster was the 61st anti-apartheid activist assassinated in South Africa since
1978, and the ninth in less than two years, according to human rights groups.
The authorities have filed charges in only one such case in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
The hearse carrying Webster's simple casket was escorted on a five-mile journey
from St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral downtown to a suburban cemetery Saturday by
jogging throngs of mourners, carrying anti-apartheid banners and singing songs
extolling the outlawed African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
During a three-hour funeral service, attended by the leading lights of the
anti-apartheid movement, Webster was eulogized as "a gallant soldier whose
determination to fight apartheid was more important than his life," in the
words of Mohammed Valli Moosa, a United Democratic Front official.
</P>
<P>
"It is people like David Webster who make black people realize that white South
Africans are human beings," said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader.
"His death is a clear indication that he was a thorn in the side of the
disciples and beneficiaries of apartheid."
</P>
<P>
Well-planned attacks on political activists and bombings of anti-apartheid
group offices have escalated in recent years, and political analysts blame
shadowy, pro-apartheid vigilante groups, some reportedly made up of police
officers or former police officers unhappy with government constraints on
security force behavior.
</P>
<P>
"These are guys who believe they are the white knights of the white race,
appointed by God to keep the black hordes and communism at bay," Mark Swilling,
an expert on black politics at the Center for Policy Studies in Washington,
D.C., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Swilling said it's no coincidence that the increase in vigilante activity has
coincided with a decline in the number of massacres, beatings and incidents of
torture by police, who are under intense international pressure to shape up
their image.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Muzzles Police'
</P>
<P>
The right-wingers "think the government has betrayed whites. And when the state
muzzles the police, they figure the only natural and moral thing is to take it
upon themselves to eliminate the revolutionaries," Swilling said.
</P>
<P>
Max Coleman, a white activist and friend of Webster, said his colleague's death
"bears all the hallmarks of a professional, well-informed hit squad. And there
is no more profitable place to start the investigation than within the ranks of
the police themselves."
</P>
<P>
The South African police have denied involvement in any of the bombings or
assassinations since 1978, and they have launched a highly publicized search
for Webster's killers, issuing sketches of the wanted men and offering a
10,000-rand ($4,000) reward for information leading to their capture.
</P>
<P>
But the failure to solve these crimes in the past "feeds suspicion that agents
of the state, on duty or off duty, are guilty, and that the state itself does
not want the crimes solved," the Business Day newspaper said in an editorial
last week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unlikely Target
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Webster seemed an unlikely target for such a hit squad.
Although he was one of the few white members of the UDF, a banned
anti-apartheid coalition, the quiet, baldish professor was not a prominent
political activist. He often referred to himself as "just a small fry," friends
said, and unlike thousands of other activists he had never been banned,
detained or restricted by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
But Webster was well-known to the local police because of his work with the
families of detainees. He helped organize many social gatherings for released
detainees and their relatives, often booking the meeting halls in his name.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, he had frequently come face-to-face with police attempting to
break up those "detainee tea parties" in black townships. Webster usually
attempted to negotiate with the police, and he was warned several times that no
more tea parties would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks before his death, police surrounded a Johannesburg church
during another tea party. Webster's attempts to mediate that time were futile
and police ordered the meeting to disperse.
</P>
<P>
"He was the kind of person every security policeman loved to hate," said
Swilling. "He had a moral courage that the police came into contact with
regularly. And he was a white man whom the black comrades loved."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Webster had begun writing about government repression for
human rights publications, and he became an expert in the field of "extra-legal
repression" -- political assassins, hit squads and vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Webster and Maggie Friedman, his girlfriend and co-researcher, had
driven their small pickup to the bakery and returned home, parking on the
street. When Webster walked to the back of the truck to let his dogs out, a car
drove slowly past and a shotgun was fired at Webster's chest. He collapsed and
died almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
His funeral drew dozens of foreign diplomats and hundreds of anti-apartheid
leaders, including white activists such as 84-year-old Helen Joseph, the Rev.
Beyers Naude and Raymond Suttner. Suttner, a law professor and former detainee,
served as a pallbearer, defying a government order that prohibits him from
being with more than four people at a time.
</P>
<P>
Webster's friend Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most famous pop musician, flew in
from Los Angeles, a stop on his current U.S. tour. Clegg and Webster, both
anthropologists, shared a passion for black township life and music.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unrestricted Funeral
</P>
<P>
Anti-government demonstrations of any kind are illegal in South Africa, and
police have routinely limited the number of mourners and speakers at political
funerals. But Webster's funeral was not restricted, and several hundred police
impassively monitored the funeral and parade route.
</P>
<P>
Webster's murder reminded many of the death of Ric Turner, a white professor at
Natal University, who was shot to death as he answered a knock on his front
door in 1978. No one was arrested in that case, and since then a string of
activists have been killed by "persons unknown," in the words of the police.
</P>
<P>
Griffiths Mxenge, a Durban civil rights attorney, was stabbed to death on his
way home from work in 1981. His wife, Victoria, began a campaign to identify
his killers but, four years later, she was hacked to death in front of her
children.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Dhlomo, 19, made allegations of police brutality last year in a
documentary aired by CBS and was later interviewed by police about those
claims. Four days after he talked to police, he was found shot to death.
</P>
<P>
The only such killing to result in arrests was that of Eric Mtonga, 35, a
regional director of the Institute for Democratic Alternatives for South
Africa. Mtonga was beaten to death and then stabbed in the heart. Several
senior police officers from the Ciskei homeland have been charged.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, more than 50 anti-apartheid activists have been killed by
unknown assailants outside of South Africa. And unknown bombers and arsonists
have destroyed several buildings occupied by anti-apartheid organizations.

   Thousands of blacks and whites
thronged to a cathedral today for the funeral of assassinated white
activist David Webster, then followed his coffin in one of the
largest anti-apartheid marches of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   Mourners jogging behind the hearse and packed into buses gave
clenched fist salutes to passersby and chanted the initials of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement as they
headed through central Johannesburg toward a cemetery six miles
away in a whites-only suburb.
   Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a man firing
a shotgun at close range from a passing car. Police have issued
sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the killing,
which provoked grief and outrage throughout the anti-apartheid
movement.
   Webster, a professor of anthropology, was one of the few senior
white members of the predominantly black United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   He was a prominent critic of the government's policy of
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved
killings and abductions of anti-apartheid activists that have
occurred over the past decade.
   ``He helped us (blacks) realize there are white people who are
human beings,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader,
at the three-hour funeral service. ``His life should be a message
to all white South Africans to rediscover the humanity that could
make this country free.''
   About 2,000 people filled St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral for the
funeral, while hundreds more stood outside, singing freedom songs
during the service.
   Eulogies for Webster were interspersed with performances by
white and black singers and a black jazz group. The mourners
included diplomats from more than a dozen Western countries, human
rights activists from across South Africa, residents of a remote
Zulu community where Webster conducted research, and fellow
supporters of a Soweto soccer team, the Orlando Pirates.
   The crowd included Raymond Suttner, another white,
anti-apartheid academic who was released last year after more than
two years in detention, and Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most
successful pop music star, who flew back from a tour in the United
States to pay tribute to a man whom he credited for helping to
inspire his Zulu-style rock 'n' roll.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, secretary-general of the United Democratic
Front, described Webster as ``a gallant soldier whose determination
to fight apartheid was more important than his life.''
   He said Webster's work in support of detainees over the past
three years, a period when about 30,000 activists have been held
for varying times without charge, ``denied the government the
ability to break our spirits.''
   ``It is widely suspected that the assassin is a member of the
police force ... maybe on duty outside this cathedral,'' Valli
Moosa said.
   Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white activist the South African
media are not allowed to quote, said: ``The guilt for David's death
lies squarely on the shoulders of the National Party government.''
   Hundreds of policemen, including some in helicopters, were
deployed to monitor the funeral and the route along which 5,000
marchers and bus-riders traveled to West Park Cemetary.
   Anti-government parades are not allowed in South Africa, and
police have restricted most funerals of slain activists, placing
limits on the number of mourners, the content of speeches, and size
of the funeral procession.
   But at Webster's funeral, policemen watched impassively as
hundreds of black youths marched and drove past chanting in support
of the African National Congress.

   Thousands of black and white
mourners Saturday staged the largest anti-apartheid march of the
3-year-old state of emergency, chanting through whites-only suburbs
in a funeral procession for an assassinated white activist.
   Young blacks gave clenched fist salutes, waved banners and sang
in support of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement as they jogged in unison behind the hearse or perched atop
overflowing buses for a six-mile journey from a downtown cathedral
to a cemetery.
   David Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a
shotgun blast fired at close range from a passing car. Police have
issued sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the
killing, which provoked grief and anger throughout the
anti-apartheid movement.
   A professor of anthropology, Webster was one of the few senior
white members of the predominantly black United Democratic Front, a

detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved
killings and abductions of anti-apartheid activists that have

three-hour funeral service at St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral. ``His

   More than 2,000 people of all races filled the cathedral.
Hundreds more stood outside, singing freedom songs.
   Hundreds of policemen, some in helicopters, monitored the
funeral and the route which the roughly 5,000 marchers and
bus-riders took to West Park Cemetery. Police stayed away from the
gravesite, where four young blacks unfurled a large ANC flag after
hiding their faces.
   Other youths joined clergymen in sprinkling dirt onto the wooden
coffin after it was lowered into the grave. Said one of the
ministers, veteran white activist Beyers Naude: ``David is saying
`Stop the violence, stop the killings, stop the injustice.'''
   Anti-government parades are illegal in South Africa, and most
funerals of slain activists have been restricted by police during
the emergency, with limits placed on the number of mourners,
content of speeches, and size of the funeral procession.
   But Webster's funeral was not restricted, and policemen watched
impassively as throngs of militant mourners paraded past them.

   Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white activist whom South African

   ``The guilt for David's death lies squarely on the shoulders of

<HEAD>Police Confirm Arrest of Ex-Detective in Slayings of White Activists</HEAD>

   A former narcotics detective
has been arrested in the assassinations of two prominent white
activists, one in South Africa and one in Namibia, police said
Thursday.
   Police headquarters refused to release the name of the
31-year-old suspect, saying it confirmed his arrest only after
newspapers reported it. An official statement said further arrests
in the slayings were possible.
   An evening news report on government-run TV said it was believed
police ``are looking at the possible existence of a private
assassination squad with strong right-wing links.''
   The suspect, a white former police sergeant, was arrested this
month in the killings of David Webster, a university lecturer and
human rights activist in Johannesburg, and Anton Lubowski, a lawyer
who was the only senior white official of Namibia's main
independence movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Both men were shot to death outside their homes; Webster on May
1 in Johannesburg and Lubowski on Sept. 12 in Windhoek, Namibia.
   The suspect had not been charged and was being held for
questioning under the provisions of security legislation that
allows for indefinite detention without access to visitors or
lawyers.
   The Star, a liberal Johannesburg daily, said the suspect's
father had filed an application demanding his son's release from a
Johannesburg police station cell, but later withdrew the request.
   Police said the suspect was discharged from the police force in
1984 after being sentenced to prison on charges of murder and
theft. He was convicted of killing a suspect in one of his
investigations as a narcotics officer for the West Rand, a region
west of Johannesburg.
   ``The person has been in detention for some time,'' police said.
``The police did not wish to announce his detention because this
would have jeopardized an investigation which still has to be
launched.''
   The national police force has come under widespread criticism
for its failure to solve the Webster murder and dozens of other
killings of anti-apartheid activists over the past 10 years.
   The arrest coincides with a government investigation into
allegations by former policemen that police death squads, acting on
orders from superiors, killed numerous government opponents.
   An Irish national, Donald Acheson, 51, was arrested in Namibia
the day after Lubowski was killed. He had been held as an illegal
immigrant, but on Nov. 6 was told he would be charged in the
slaying.
   Newspapers have reported that Acheson was taken to Johannesburg
for interrogation by authorities who fought the court application
for the ex-narcotics officer's release. Those authorities also are
investigating Webster's assassination.
   Also on Thursday:
   _ Scores of protesting black bakery workers in Pretoria
reportedly were injured and 200 arrested by riot police using tear
gas and clubs. Police said five officers were hurt by bread crates
hurled from rooftops.
   Hundreds of workers gathered at the Boerstra bakery in Pretoria
to protest working conditions. Neil Coleman, a spokesman for the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, said riot police attacked
the workers without provocation. Police said the protesters ignored
repeated warnings to disperse.
   _ Police in the impoverished township of Alexandra near
Johannesburg used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 500
blacks protesting living conditions in their township. Four people
reportedly were arrested.
   _ Six anti-apartheid activists met with African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela and later said they did not believe
he would be freed from prison this year. Billy Nair, former Natal
province leader of the outlawed ANC military wing, did not comment
on the more prominent expectation that Mandela would be freed early
next year. President F.W. de Klerk said, ``The matter is receiving
attention. ... We will make an announcement when we are ready.''
   _ De Klerk prepared to travel to the Ivory Coast for a meeting
Friday with President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to discuss mutual
relations and the Angolan civil war. The two countries have no
formal diplomatic relations, but extensive trade ties.
Houphouet-Boigny condemns apartheid, South Africa's legal system of
racial separation, but criticizes as counterproductive sanctions to
force South Africa to give equal rights to its black majority.

   A judge today overruled police
investigators and ordered the release of a former policeman
detained in the assassination of two white left-wing activists.
   Police had opposed the release of Calla Botha, saying there was
evidence linking him to a right-wing group responsible for
political assassinations.
   Johannesburg Supreme Court Justice J.C. Kriegler granted an
application filed by Botha's father, a retired police colonel,
seeking release of his son. Kriegler said there was insufficient
evidence connecting Botha to death squads.
   Botha was detained without charge on Nov. 30 as part of an
investigation into the assassinations of David Webster, a
university lecturer and human rights activist, and Anton Lubowski,
the only white office-holder in Namibia's main independence
movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Both were shot outside their homes _ Webster in Johannesburg on
May 1 and Lubowski in Windhoek, Namibia, on Sept. 12.
   In a court affidavit last week, police Brig. Floris Mostert
described Botha as the ``handler'' for Donald Acheson, who is held
in Windhoek awaiting trial for Lubowksi's murder.
   Another former policeman, Ferdinand Barnard, remains detained in
Johannesburg in the case. Mostert said Botha and Barnard were held
briefly in June after they were uncovered monitoring the movements
of one of Webster's activist colleagues.
   Police say the Webster-Lubowski case is not directly related to
investigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of the
national police force killed government opponents on the orders of
high-ranking officers.
   One black ex-policeman has pleaded guilty to committing a murder
as part of such a death squad, and a white former captain, Dirk
Coetzee, fled abroad after telling a newspaper he commanded a death
squad.
   In other developments today:
   _Police headquarters reported five more deaths in factional
fighting in black townships around the port city of Durban.
Authorities say more than 100 people have been killed in the area
this month in violence related to a three-year feud throughout
Natal Province between Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu
political organization, and supporters of militant anti-apartheid
groups.
   _Police freed four black activists who staged a three-week
hunger strike after they were detained without charge while leading
an unauthorized protest in Alexandra, an impoverished black
township near Johannesburg.
   Obed Bapela, a spokesman for the anti-apartheid Alexandra Civic
Organization, said the four had suspended their fast Friday after
police informed them they would soon be freed.

   A judge today rejected an
application to free a white former police captain allegedly
involved in a secret terror network that harassed and assassinated
anti-apartheid activists.
   The suspect, Ferdinand Barnard, has been held without charge
since Oct. 31 as part an investigation into the assassinations last
year of two white activists: Johannesburg university lecturer David
Webster and Namibian lawyer Anton Lubowski.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice H.J. Priess rejected a bid by
Barnard's father, a retired police colonel, to have the former
narcotics detective released.
   In Windhoek, Namibia, another Supreme Court judge today set
April 18 as the start of a murder trial for Donald Acheson, a
suspected accomplice of Barnard who is accused of involvement in
Lubowksi's killing.
   Lubowski, shot and killed outside his Windhoek home on Sept. 12,
was the only white to hold a leadership position in Namibia's
independence movement, the South-West African People's
Organization. Webster, a well-known human rights activist, was shot
and killed outside his Johannesburg home on May 1.
   Police Brig. Floris Mostert, in testimony opposing Barnard's
release, said the investigation into the assassinations had
uncovered the existence of ``a secret organization ... with members
from all levels of society, which strives to terrorize left-wing
radicals with the aid of violence and intimidation.''
   Dozens of anti-apartheid activists have been the victims of
unsolved murders in recent years. Many others have had their cars
vandalized, and there have been bombings or arson attacks on
offices of militant trade unions, civil rights groups, and
opposition newspapers.
   Mostert said Barnard had been in contact with Acheson prior to
Lubowski's murder. The brigadier also said: ``I must respectfully
stress that the nature of my investigation is extremely sensitive
and that the secrecy of the information which I possess is of the
utmost importance.''
   Police say the Webster-Lubowski case is not directly related to
investigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of the
national police force killed government opponents on the orders of
high-ranking officers.
   One black ex-policeman, Butana Nofemela, has pleaded guilty to
committing a murder as part of such a death squad, and a white
former captain, Dirk Coetzee, has fled abroad after telling a
newspaper he commanded a death squad.
   Thus far, legal steps have been taken only against Nofemela and
Coetzee, not against other policemen implicated by them. This has
resulted in widespread demands for an independent judicial inquiry
and accusations that President F.W. de Klerk's government is
engaged in a cover-up.
   Some of the white officers implicated by Coetzee appeared today
at an inquest into the deaths of four young black activists in
1986. The policemen have denied allegations that the youths were
murdered, saying they were shot in self-defense by a special
counter-insurgency unit.

   Members of a secret
intelligence unit planted bombs, were suspects in political
killings and plotted to harass Archbishop Desmond Tutu by sending
him a baboon fetus, an intelligence official said Monday.
   Gen. Rudolph Badenhorst, head of the Military Intelligence
branch of the Defense Force, was the first witness to testify
before a judicial inquiry into allegations of military and police
participation in death squads.
   Opposition leaders claim the squads may have been involved in
about 60 unsolved murders of anti-government activists in the past
decade.
   Badenhorst said the Civil Cooperation Bureau _ a unit so secret
that President F.W. de Klerk says he was not told of its existence
until recently _ had blown up a Pretoria store owned by an
anti-apartheid activist, exploded a bomb at a community hall in a
mixed-race township near Cape Town and planned to deliver a baboon
fetus to Tutu, an anti-apartheid leader and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Badenhorst gave no reason for the plan to send the fetus. He
said the idea was called ``Operation Apie.''
   The intelligence chief said an internal military investigation
begun in November revealed that prominent anti-apartheid activists
such as black mineworkers leader Cyril Ramaphosa, the Rev. Frank
Chikane of the South African Council of Churches and Jay Naidoo,
general secretary of the nation's largest trade union federation,
were on a list to have their movements monitored.
   He maintained that he did not know the bureau existed before
November and he didn't know the purpose of the surveillance.
   The secret unit reportedly consisted of cells of civilians,
mostly former policemen, in undercover operations against
government opponents.
   An attorney for the Civil Cooperation Bureau said its chief,
Col. Joe Verster, had been detained Friday for questioning by
police who are investigating the 1989 assassinations of David
Webster, a Johannesburg anthropologist, and Anton Lubowski, the
only white executive member of the South-West African People's
Organization in Namibia.
   Badenhorst confirmed that three former policemen wanted in
Lubowski's death were members of the Civil Cooperation Bureau. All
three disappeared last month after police in Namibia issued
warrants for their arrests. Badenhorst said the Civil Cooperation
Bureau was not involved in Webster's slaying.
   He said that during questioning by military investigators,
Verster had seemed surprised at some of the activities of bureau
members, and was especially surprised by the hiring of an
ex-policeman, Ferdie Barnard, after he had been released from
prison.
   De Klerk, who became president in August, said Defense Minister
Magnus Malan did not tell him of the Civil Cooperation Bureau until
January. Badenhorst told the commission de Klerk had not sanctioned
any of the unit's activities.
   Malan said Monday he did not know the bureau existed until
November.
   The defense minister has said he never authorized killings or
other illegal acts, but he has come under increasing pressure from
opposition parties to resign.
   In another judicial inquiry ordered by de Klerk, Supreme Court
Justice Richard Goldstone ruled that Clayton Sizwe Sithole,
identified by friends as the former boyfriend of Nelson Mandela's
youngest daughter, Zindziwe, committed suicide in police custody on
Jan. 27.
   Sithole had been arrested with others in a murder investigation,
and after police interrogation he was found hanging by his
shoelaces and belt at the Johannesburg police headquarters.
   Goldstone said there were no recent injuries on his body other
than those associated with hanging.

A judge Monday overruled police investigators and ordered the release of a
former policeman detained in the assassination of two white left-wing
activists.
</P>
<P>
Police had opposed the release of Calla Botha, saying there was evidence
linking him to a right-wing group responsible for political assassinations.
</P>
<P>
But Johannesburg Supreme Court Justice J. C. Kriegler granted an application
filed by Botha's father, a retired police colonel, seeking release of his son.
Kriegler said there was insufficient evidence connecting Botha to death squads.
</P>
<P>
Botha was detained without charge on Nov. 30 as part of an investigation into
the assassinations of David Webster, a university lecturer and human rights
activist, and Anton Lubowski, the only white officeholder in Namibia's main
independence movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.
</P>
<P>
Both were shot outside their homes -- Webster in Johannesburg on May 1 and
Lubowski in Windhoek, Namibia, on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
In a court affidavit last week, police Brig. Floris Mostert described Botha as
the "handler" for Donald Acheson, who is being held in Windhoek awaiting trial
for Lubowski's murder.
</P>
<P>
Another former policeman, Ferdinand Barnard, is still in custody in
Johannesburg on the case. Mostert said Botha and Barnard were held briefly in
June after they were uncovered monitoring the movements of one of Webster's
activist colleagues.

   Three convicted murderers were
hanged today, but another received a stay of execution after
claiming he was part of a police death squad that killed a
prominent black anti-apartheid activist.
   Butana Nofemela was to be hanged at dawn at Pretoria Central
Prison along with two other blacks and a mixed-race man. But
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, after receiving an urgent request
from human rights lawyers, granted a stay of execution pending an
investigation of Nofemela's claims.
   According to lawyers, Nofemela said in an affadavit he was one
of four security policemen who killed activist Griffiths Mxenge in
1981 under orders from senior officers. Nofemela also said he was
partly responsible for the killings of eight other political
activists ordered by his superiors.
   Nofemela, 32, was convicted in 1987 of murdering a white farmer
in a case apparently without political overtones.
   Peter Mothle, a director of the Pretoria-based organization
Lawyers for Human Rights, said lawyers who studied Nofemela's
affidavit found it credible, containing accurate details related to
Mxenge's killings.
   Mxenge's body was found outside a Durban-area stadium in
November 1981. He had been stabbed more than 40 times.
   Mxenge's wife, Victoria, an attorney and activist, was killed in
August 1985. They are among several dozen anti-apartheid activists
_ black and white _ who have been killed in recent years in cases
that have never been solved.
   Many activists believe most or all of the killings were carried
out by elements of the security forces.
   After the assassination in May of David Webster, a white
activist and university lecturer, police formed a special
investigative force to probe both that killing and unsolved
bombings of offices of anti-apartheid groups. No arrests have been
made.
   Mothle said Nofemela's claims initially would be investigated by
the office of the Transvaal Province attorney general.
   ``We hope they won't turn it over to the police, but we have no
control over that,'' he said.
   The three hangings Friday raised to 45 the number of executions
so far this year. One of the prisoners was a mixed-race man
convicted of killing two residents of an retirement home.
   The other two were blacks convicted of murder during a 1986
robbery.
   Two of the men hanged this year were white, the rest black or of
mixed-race. The number of hangings so far this year is much lower
than in recent years, such as 1987, when a record 164 people were
hanged.
   The government says 60 condemned prisoners have received
reprieves this year. More than 200 prisoners, nearly all of them
black men, remain on Death Row.
   Anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa, including senior members
of the African National Congress guerrilla movement freed last
Sunday, have listed an end to executions as one of their conditions
for agreeing to enter negotiations with the white-led government.

   Three anti-apartheid activists
who escaped from custody and fled to the U.S. Consulate five weeks
ago emerged Wednesday and pledged to resume their opposition to the
government.
   South African authorities say they won't arrest the three, who
had been jailed without charge for more a year before they slipped
away from police guards and fled to the consulate Sept. 13.
   The activists _ all senior officials of banned anti-apartheid
organizations _ spent the next 36 nights in a consular meeting room
on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
   The three said they had little faith in the government's promise
not to act against them.
   ``Our experience with the government is that we must be very
cautious and not accept anything at face vale,'' said Murphy Morobe.
   But they added they were influenced to leave their sanctuary on
the advice of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``The view of comrade Nelson Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible, and that assisted us in our
decision,'' said Mohammed Valli Moosa.
   Mandela's message was relayed to the men via his wife, Winnie.
The couple met Saturday at the Cape Town clinic where Mandela is
recuperating from tuberculosis.
   ``We entered the U.S. Consulate not simply to secure our own
freedom, but to stir the conscience of South Africa and the
international community about the plight of our fellow detainees,''
said Valli Moosa.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge
during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About 1,000 are
believed in detention.
   The three smiled broadly as they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting for them in the lobby of the building. Scores of
journalists and about 200 supporters also were present.
   The activists gave clenched-fist salutes to the cheering crowd,
mostly young blacks who chanted ``Amandla,'' the Zulu word for
``power.''
   Riot police, armed with truncheons and shotguns, sought to keep
the crowd under control and police camera crews photographed the
event.
   ``It's great to be out of here,'' said the third activist, Vusi
Khanyile.
   Valli Moosa and Morobe are senior leaders of the United
Democratic Front, and Khanyile is chairman of the National
Education Crisis Committee. Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli
Moosa is Indian.
   The front is the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. The
crisis committee was formed to seek greater black control over
education policies.
   The activists later held a news conference at the nearby
University of the Witwatersrand. Before it began, a television crew
from the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. was subjected
to jeers from the crowd and left at the request of organizers.
   The three men said they would resume their anti-apartheid
activities although they declined to give specifics.
   ``We would like to continue as before, but obviously there are
major constraints,'' said Morobe. ``Our major concern is for other
colleagues in detention.''
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in 1987 after
going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June 12,
1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in 1986.
   They escaped while undergoing physiotherapy at a Johannesburg
hospital.
   Before his detention, Morobe operated from underground as chief
spokesman for the United Democratic Front. One of the UDF's most
eloquent speakers and writers, he played a key role in coveying its
positions at a time when most of its leadership was in jail or in
hiding.
   The activists said they had cordial relations with the U.S.
Consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``We would like to interpret it as a snub ... but there may have
been other reasons,'' said Morobe. He said the three did not
request a meeting with Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador in
South Africa.
   In February, the government banned the front and other major
anti-apartheid groups from functioning.
   It is unclear whether the government will allow them to promote
the front's positions freely or whether they will be restricted
again.
   ``We hope the government will react differently this time,''
said Morobe. ``We are eternal optimists.''
   The U.S. Embassy said in a statement: ``The U.S. government did
not negotiate and was not involved in their decision to leave ...
They arrived at their decision after consultations with their
families and advisers.''
   South African officials did not issue a statement.

   The highly publicized trial of
a white supremacist who killed seven blacks and an Asian could
incite further violence by right-wing extremists, a prominent
newspaper editor said today.
   The warning by Harvey Tyson, editor of The Star of Johannesburg,
followed a week of dramatic testimony in the trial of Barend
Strydom, a 23-year-old former policeman who killed or wounded more
than 20 blacks during a shooting spree on the sidewalks of downtown
Pretoria in November.
   Strydom was convicted of eight counts of murder on Tuesday. Over
the next three days, he and his father outlined their racist views
as part of proceedings to determine whether Strydom should be
sentenced to death.
   Sentencing is expected next week.
   Strydom told the Pretoria Supreme Court that his actions were
justifiable and said he would do the same again if given the
chance. His father, also a former policeman, said he believed
blacks were animals, not humans.
   Both father and son belong to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement. Fellow members of the group have attended the trial to
show solidarity with the defendant.
   Tyson, whose newspaper is South Africa's largest-selling daily,
said in a column that the extensive local news coverage of the
trial ``bodes ill for a country which has bred so many extremists.''
   ``We may be witnessing an increase in the growth of the
ultra-right's incoherent killing,'' he wrote. ``It seems more than
likely that Barend Strydom's actions could be repeated, not just by
a madman but by sane members of a secret group in our society.''
   Tyson said he had received an anonymous death threat in the mail
last week.
   Police have been investigating Strydom's claims that he belonged
to a clandestine right-wing terror group called the Wit Wolwe
(White Wolves), but senior officers say they doubt such a group
exists.
   A weekly anti-apartheid newspaper, Vyre Weekblad (Free Weekly),
reported Friday that Stydom had handed a letter to one of its
reporters claiming that the Wit Wolwe were responsible for the
``removal'' of David Webster, a white anti-apartheid activist who
was assassinated on May 1.
   The letter also indicated the group was responsible for a recent
bombing that damaged the home of a Parliament member of the
governing National Party.
   In his testimony, Strydom claimed that Wit Wolwe leaders had
instructed him to try to kill Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
the Rev. Allan Boesak, two anti-apartheid church leaders.
   Dozens of activists, almost all of them black, have been slain
in recent years, but in only one case has there been a murder
conviction. Police have made no arrests in connection with
Webster's killing.
   ``It is vitally important that all political killers are brought
to book as quickly as possible,'' Tyson wrote. ``For if justice is
not swift and seen to be impartial, communal insanity will grow.''

   Authorities have chained,
assaulted and tortured the president of a banned anti-apartheid
youth group during his month-long detention, his lawyers said
Wednesday.
   The allegations were made in an application filed in court on
behalf of Peter Mokaba. The document seeks to restrain police from
alleged assaults and requests that a magistrate and doctor be
allowed to see him.
   The government has confirmed Mokaba's detention under the
Internal Security Act, which does not require that authorities give
a reason. However, the government has said the activist has not
been assaulted while in custody.
   Mokaba, 29, is president of the South African Youth Congress,
one of 17 anti-apartheid groups effectively banned by the
government in February. The leadership of the group, which claims
700,000 members nationwide, is mostly in jail or hiding.
   The group has worked against apartheid, which by South African
law and custom establishes a segregated society in which the 26
million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   The activist had been held in several police stations in
northern Transvaal province since his detention about four weeks
ago, according to lawyers of Cheadle-Thompson, the law firm
representing Mokaba.
   They said his mother has been also been detained since she
accused authorities of torturing her son.
   Their papers were filed at Pretoria Supreme Court. They asked
that a magistrate be assigned to take statements from Mokaba about
his alleged mistreatment. They also asked that he be examined by a
district surgeon.
   Lawyers said a hearing on their application would resume Friday,
when they plan to file an affidavit from Mokaba's mother.
   In another development Wednesday, a black guerrilla freed from a
guarded hospital room by armed colleagues two years ago was
convicted of murder and terrorism.
   Gordon Webster, 24, was recaptured in September when he tried to
return to South Africa from Botswana.
   He was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one
which killed a police colonel. A bystander was killed when gunmen
burst into Edendale Hospital in May 1986 and freed Webster.

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Excerpt] A series of inconclusive inquiries into political
violence overseen by Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht will
come under fresh scrutiny in the next fortnight by a team of
international investigators appointed by the President F.W. de
Klerk. The Goldstone commission, which named General
Engelbrecht as one of three top generals implicated in "Third
Force" activity, has a mass of new information to put before the
investigators. This information is expected to throw the
spotlight on the remarkable record of failure by the SA [South
African] Police [SAP] to resolve a series of cased of serious
political violence.
  As head of SAP's counter-intelligence department, General
Engelbrecht is in charge of all investigations dealing with
violence and subversion -- including train, taxi and hostel
massacres. Before that, he was involved in two major
investigations into security force involvement in hit squad
activities.
  The sequence begins with the allegations of convicted
murderer Almond Nofomela in 1989 that he and another police
officer based at Vlakplaas, Dirk Coetzee, had murdered
anti-apartheid figures. General Engelbrecht was requested to
assist the McNally commission of inquiry into the allegations.
Tim McNally later led evidence before the Harms commission,
which found there was no proof of a state-sanctioned police hit
squad at Vlakplaas.
  Then General Engelbrecht was appointed by former Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to assist in an investigation of the
SA Defence Force after claims that the CCB [Civil Cooperation
Bureau], a covert military organisation, was involved in
murdering political opponents of the government. He paid
particular attention to the assassination of Wits academic David
Webster, allegedly by a CCB hit squad. At the Webster inquest,
retired police general Jaap Jourbert said General Engelbrecht
had sent a message to detained murder suspect Ferdi Barnard that
he should not speak for six or seven months about CCB
activities. A week before his evidence, the investigating
officer, Warrant Officer Wessel Rousseau, had told the Rand
Supreme Court General Engelbrecht had warned two other CCB
operatives not to talk. They were Calla Botha and Slang van
Zyl. The inquest court could not make a conclusive finding. The
Harms commission later found the CCB was not responsible for the
murder of Dr Webster.
  General Engelbrecht is one of three generals placed on
compulsory leave on Friday by Mr de Klerk for allegedly being
involved in providing arms to Inkatha for hit-squad activities,
illegally manufacturing weapons, issuing false documents and
passports, fomenting violence and attempting cover-ups when the
Goldstone commission began its work.
  The evidence provided by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on
Friday, described as prima facie of criminal action, is only a
part of the allegations of illegal activities that will be
provided to a special task team of international policemen.
Evidence received by the Goldstone commission, but not yet
disclosed, includes allegations of car theft and corruption in a
rewards scheme for AK-47 assault rifles and other criminal acts
by policemen. [passage omitted]

   Members of the country's main
guerrilla movement, the African National Congress, are reeling from
a string of setbacks, including revelations of a spy in their midst
and a crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.
   Three guerrillas face a possible trip to the gallows, one leader
was assassinated and a purported informer supposedly photographed
secret guerrilla documents and turned them over to the government.
   Congress leaders acknowledge the setbacks and have acknowledged
that South Africa's nearly 2-year-old state of emergency has
hobbled ANC efforts to undermine white-minority rule.
   During a recent trip to ANC headquarters in Zambia, guerrilla
leaders engaged in ``an orgy of self-criticism,'' according to a
story last week in The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper.
   But it said there remained lingering optimism.
   ``The emergency and the general repression are counterproductive
for the regime,'' ANC official Steve Tshwete was quoted as saying.
``In terms of heightening resentment and mobilizing mass opinion .
.. the situation is favorable for our activities.''
   But the bad news for the congress includes:
   _ The March 29 assassination of guerrilla leader Dulcie
September in Paris.
   _ The April 7 maiming of Albie Sachs, a lawyer and ANC member
who was seriously injured by a car bomb in Mozambique.
   _ The April 15 death of a guerrilla killed when a mine he was
carrying blew up in Pretoria, prompting pro-government newspapers
to claim the group has stooped to using poorly trained ``kamikaze''
bombers.
   In February, the government prohibited political activities by
major anti-apartheid groups. In addition, three ANC members
convicted of murder, terror and treason face possible death
sentences.
   In Messina, near the northern border with Zimbabwe, Mzondileli
Nondula, 25, and Mthetheleli Mncube, 28, are expected to be
sentenced within the next few days.
   Nondula was convicted of killing two white women and four
children who died in a blast when the truck they were riding in
struck a mine. Mncube was convicted of planting a mine that killed
a black man in November 1985 and of killing two white policemen
during a subsequent escape attempt.
   In the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, Gordon Webster,
24, was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one
that killed a police colonel.
   At another trial of three alleged ANC members charged with
terrorism and treason, evidence submitted included secret internal
documents, purportedly photographed by a spy, that cited problems
faced by the guerrilla movement because of informers and shortages
of weapons and funds.
   Defense witnesses described Webster as a gentle young man who
joined the congress in a state of despair over racial
discrimination in South Africa, where the system of apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.
   Taking the stand to plead for his life, Webster professed
loyalty to the congress but voiced some disenchantment.
   Asked what he would do if he could start over again, he replied:
``I would like to be a teacher.''
   Formed as a non-violent civil rights group in 1912, the ANC was
banned in 1960 and a year later began a bombing and sabotage
campaign.
   Its tactics are repudiated by some moderate blacks, but it is
believed capable of winning a national election if restrictions on
black voting rights and political activity were lifted.

<HEAD>Escaped Terrorist Suspects in Namibia Linked to Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three suspected right-wing
terrorists who escaped custody in Namibia had been linked to South
African-based death squads believed to have killed two white
activists, police said Tuesday.
   South Africa's state-run television reported that police were
investigating the possibility the escape may have been arranged by
a far-right group that had drawn up a ``hit list'' of potential
assassination targets.
   The report said five suspected members of the group had been
arrested. It did not identify the organization or give further
details.
   The escapees _ two South Africans and a West German _
overpowered police guards Monday and fled in a car with two
accomplices near Windhoek, Namibia's territorial capital.
   One of the officers, Ricardo van Wyk, was hit in the spine by a
shot from his own revolver, which was seized. He was unconscious in
a Windhoek hospital Tuesday, and doctors said he might be paralyzed.
   The escapees had been charged with murdering a black security
guard in a hand grenade attack on a United Nations office in
northern Namibia in August. South African police said the three
were connected to two former South African police officers held in
the assassinations of David Webster of Johannesburg on May 1 and
Anton Lubowksi of Windhoek on Sept. 12.
   Police have said the ex-officers also have been linked to death
squads, some of which allegedly existed in the national police
force.
   Webster was a university lecturer and human rights advocate.
Lubowski was the only white official of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, the main independence movement in Namibia.
   The grenade attack on the U.N. office in the town of Outjo and
the assassination of Lubowski were the most publicized incidents of
violence during the campaign for U.N.-supervised pre-independence
elections in November.
   SWAPO, which waged a 23-year guerrilla war for independence from
South Africa, won a majority in an assembly that is now drafting a
constitution. Independence is expected by early next year.
   Some right-wing whites accused the U.N. monitoring force of
favoring SWAPO in the election.
   The head of the U.N. contingent, Martti Ahtisaari, said Tuesday
it appeared that arrangements for moving the escapees between their
cells and a courthouse were ``surprisingly lax.''
   The three had been charged with the murder of David Hosaeb, 22,
a private security guard at the U.N. office.
   They were identified as Horst Klenz, 52, of West Germany, and
Darrell Stopforth, 22, and Leonard Veenendal, 23, both South
Africans.
   Veenendal headed the Johannesburg branch of the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, whose members advocate creation of a
whites-only state and often wear khaki uniforms with swastika-style
emblems.
   One of the ex-policemen held in the killing of the white
activists is Ferdinand Barnard, a former detective convicted in
1984 of murdering two drug suspects. The other is Calla Botha, a
well-known rugby player who was a member of the Brixton Murder and
Robbery Squad, the unit investigating the assassinations.
   On Monday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said police had
made progress in their investigation of South African death squads
believed involved in the slayings.
   The national police force has been criticized widely for its
failure to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists
since 1978. Opposition groups have demanded the appointment of an
independent judicial commission to conduct the investigations.

   Raymond Suttner, a law school
lecturer jailed without charge longer than any other white
activist, was freed Monday after more than two years in detention
but was placed under heavy restrictions.
   Suttner, 43, was detained June 12, 1986, the day that President
P.W. Botha declared a nationwide state of emergency that remains in
effect. Suttner spent much of his detention in solitary confinement
and was allowed a half-hour visit from his brother or sister every
two weeks.
   A restriction order issued by Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok places Suttner under nighttime house arrest and bars him from
any educational facility, effectively preventing him from returning
to his job at the University of the Witwatersrand.
   Vlok said Suttner was being released on ``humanitarian grounds''
because his health had deteriorated in recent weeks. The statement
did not elaborate.
   Suttner, wearing blue jeans and a blue sweatshirt, had a tearful
reunion with his sister and his friends at a Johannesburg house
where he will be required to spend each night. Atop his shoulder
was a small lovebird he had been allowed to keep in his cell at
Pretoria Prison.
   Friends said three months ago Suttner was allowed to keep a
bird, but the first died, and the second escaped, even though its
wings had been clipped.
   His restriction order requires him to report twice daily to the
neighborhood police station, forbids him from leaving Johannesburg
and bars him from giving interviews, according to his lawyers.
   They said Suttner also is barred from working with various
anti-apartheid organizations and cannot have more than four
visitors at his house at one time.
   An estimated 30,000 people, virtually all of them black, have
been detained for varying periods during the emergency.
   The government does not issue comprehensive statistics on
detentions. Last week, it said there were 802 detainees still in
custody who had been held longer than 30 days.
   Suttner, a law lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg, served eight years in prison starting in 1975 for
aiding the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   In March 1985, he was elected to the Transvaal Province
executive committee of the United Democratic Front, a non-banned
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   In 1986, he co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a
blueprint for a non-racial, post-apartheid South Africa that has
been endorsed by the African National Congress and the United
Democratic Front.
   Suttner was detained at Johannesburg's airport as he was about
to fly to Harare, Zimbabwe, to deliver lectures about the Freedom
Charter and popular justice.

   President F.W. de Klerk said
Friday he would not order an independent inquiry into allegations
of police death squads because justice officials could do the job
faster and just as well.
   Several police officers, serving and retired, will be
investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until
investigations or legal proceedings are completed, de Klerk and
Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, said in statements
released at 12:01 a.m.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said two former security
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be
prosecuted. One awaits execution for a non-political murder and the
other has fled the country.
   ``The government has full confidence that the tried and
respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to
bring the accused before the court, impartially and objectively,''
de Klerk in response to demands that the investigation be conducted
outside the law enforcement establishment.
   ``A judicial inquiry can take months, if not years, to reach its
final conclusions,'' he said. ``In the meanwhile, a climate of
suspicion and distrust could develop, something the country can ill
afford at this stage in its history.''
   South Africa's national police have been criticized for failing
to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists since
1978. Anti-apartheid leaders say many people believe security
personnel help plan, participate in, or cover up such actions.
   Three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper
interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death
squad operations on orders of superiors, many of whom still occupy
high positions in the police.
   The former policemen, two black and one white, said they were
involved in bombings, arson, kidnapping, robbery and murder in
South Africa and neighboring countries.
   One, Almond Nofomela, is awaiting execution. The others have
fled, but one is reported held by authorities in Botswana.
   Vlok's statement about what would be investigated mentioned only
Nofomela's allegations. He said ``a team of senior detectives''
would work with the attorneys general of Natal and Transvaal
provinces.
   The South African Council of Churches demanded access Thursday
to camps where police say former African National Congress
guerrillas are held when they agree to join the police.
   One former policemen who fled, ex-Capt. Dirk Coetzee, said the
death squads recruited such former guerrillas.
   Police identified five Afrikaner men Thursday who were arrested
in connection with an alleged far-right group suspected of planning
attacks on anti-apartheid activists. The men, all from the
Johannesburg area, range in age from 24 to 41, and were arrested
Tuesday.
   Police say the men are believed to be part of a group that broke
with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   A report in the Citizen newspaper said police were investigating
the possibility that extremists had murdered black civilians as
practice for future attacks on political targets.
   It said all five men were former members of the paramilitary
bodyguard that protected Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and he was on a ``hit list'' found
when they were arrested.
   Police are said to be investigating possible connections between
the five men and two other cases.
   In one, two former policemen are held in Johannesburg for
questioning about the assassinations of university academic David
Webster and Namibian lawyer Anton Lubowski.
   In the other, three men escaped this week from police custody
while being transported from a Namibian court, where they faced
murder charges for a grenade attack on an office of the U.N.
observers monitoring the territory's transition to independence.

<TEXT>
   The government's decision to
extend the state of emergency for a third year means continued
detention without trial for some of the country's most articulate
and effective anti-apartheid leaders.
   Many of the estimated 2,500 people detained under emergency
regulations are black activists known only in their own
communities. But scores of others formed the core of leadership of
nationwide anti-apartheid groups like the now-restricted United
Democratic Front.
   Those still in detention include:
   _Zwelakhe Sisulu, 37, editor of the New Nation, a weekly
newspaper closed by the government three months ago. Sisulu, who
was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, was detained in December
1986. His father is jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu. His mother, Albertina, is co-president of the United
Democratic Front and has been banned from speaking publicly.
   _Raymond Suttner, 42, a law school lecturer at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand and the only white emergency
detainee held for two years. Suttner served eight years in prison
starting in 1975 for aiding the outlawed African National Congress.
He co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a
non-racial, post-apartheid South Africa that has been endorsed by
the ANC and the UDF. Friends say he has spent much of his detention
in solitary confinement.
   _Henry Fazzie, 64, and Mkhuseli Jack, 30, UDF leaders from Port
Elizabeth who helped organize effective black consumer boycotts of
white-owned stores in 1985 and 1986. They were detained in August
1986. Fazzie's wife, Beauty, also is in detention, as are many
other UDF leaders from the area.
   _Vusi Khanyile, 37, chairman of the National Education Crisis
Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and student groups
seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in
their schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off
classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the
government outlawed its later campaign for ``people's education.''
Khanyile was detained in December 1986 and nearly all other top
leaders of the crisis committee have been detained since then.
   _Murphy Morobe, 32, acting publicity secretary of the UDF, who
was detained in July 1987. Between the 1986 emergency declaration
and his detention, Morobe operated from underground, wearing
disguises and showing up unannounced at newspaper offices. He is
considered one of the UDF's most eloquent writers and speakers.
   _Ivy Gcina, 51, leader of the UDF-affiliated Port Elizabeth
Women's Organization, detained for the entire emergency. Employed
as a cleaning woman at a school, she had five children _ including
one killed in unrest and three who have fled the country.
   _Brian Sokutu, a Port Elizabeth-based free-lance journalist,
held for the entire emergency.

   A South African court Monday
sentenced a member of the African National Congress to 25 years in
prison for murder and terrorism.
   Gordon Webster, 24, was convicted by the Pietermaritzburg
Supreme Court of bombing several electrical transformers. One
bombing killed a police colonel.
   Webster's case drew widespread attention when armed colleagues
freed him from a guarded hospital room in May 1986. Webster was
recaptured last September after he planned to take hostages in a
bid to free one of his rescuers, who by that time was awaiting
execution.
   In the highly publicized trial, which ended on Monday, defense
witnesses described Webster as a gentle young man who joined the
guerrilla group in a state of despair over racial discrimination in
South Africa.
   ``Sometimes I wished I could be white,'' Webster said.
``Sometimes I was angry for having color, for what I was _ black.''
   The prosecution said Webster joined the ANC willingly and was
aware that the organization waged a bombing and sabotage campaign.
   The congress, based in Lusaka, Zambia, is the main black group
fighting to overthrow the government of South Africa and end
apartheid.
   The judge and two assessors handling the case said they agreed
on the 25-year sentence after considering the extenuating
circumstances in the case. They said Webster's impoverished
upbringing and skin color caused him difficulties as a youth. They
also said Webster had not intended to kill people when he planted
bombs.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Stompie Seipei, the 14-year-old
activist allegedly murdered by Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was
buried Saturday and eulogized as a youth who gave up his childhood
to fight for freedom.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, was not mentioned by name during the funeral service.
   Some anti-apartheid leaders have renounced her since Seipei's
death, but speakers at the funeral urged reconciliation.
   About 500 mourners packed into a Roman Catholic church in
Tumahole, the township where Seipei, at age 10, became commander of
an army of militant boys who agitated against apartheid.
   They sang songs of freedom, raised clenched fists and chanted
their loyalty to the ANC guerrilla movement and to Mandela, the
country's best-known black leader.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, leader of the Methodist Church in the
Johannesburg region, blamed apartheid for Seipei's death.
   ``What have we done in this country, that a child who should have
been chattering in a classroom or playing marbles in his backyard
should have become a 14-year-old general with the tired eyes of an
old man?'' asked Storey, a white.
   The number of mourners swelled to about 1,000 as chanting,
singing youths ran ahead of the hearse to the cemetery where Seipei
was buried.
   Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer
club, in December allegedly abducted Seipei and three young men
staying at a Methodist Church sanctuary in Soweto, the township
outside Johannesburg.
   The victims allegedly were taken to Mrs. Mandela's home and
beaten.
   Police say Seipei's decomposed body was found in a Soweto field
Jan. 7.
   The three others implicated Mandela United members in their
abduction, and two team members and the club's bus driver were
arrested last week in connection with Seipei's slaying.
   Two other murders also have been linked to Mandela United.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any knowledge of Seipei's death but has
said the youths were taken from the church because they were being
sexually abused by a white minister, the Rev. Paul Verryn. Methodist
officials have said the allegations are false, and Verryn attended
Saturday's funeral.
   Speakers at the service indicated Seipei's killers may have
thought incorrectly that he was a police informer.
   During the 32-month-old state of emergency imposed by the South
African government to quell unrest in black townships, police often
have restricted the size and duration of funerals for slain
activists.
   No restrictions were imposed on Seipei's funeral, however, and
speakers suggested that authorities were trying to exploit his death
to deepen divisions in the black community.
   ``We shouldn't point fingers at other people, because Stompie was
interested in unity,'' said McLean Skosane, a local anti-apartheid
leader. ``Don't let his death divide us.''
   Leading anti-apartheid groups have accused Mandela United of
terrorizing Soweto residents and for months asked Mrs. Mandela to
disband the group, which lived at her home. She refused the request
until last week.
   Police searched her home Monday and said they found blood on
walls and weapons including clubs and a knife.
   She has called the actions by police and anti-apartheid activists
a plot to discredit her.
   Seipei became an anti-apartheid leader at age 10, when he and a
friend formed the ``Under Fourteens'' in Tumahole, about 60 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
   More than 1,000 youths served under Seipei and challenged police
and pro-government vigilantes during the height of township unrest
in 1985-86.
   ``The other groups were all talk and no action,'' the youth told
a British journalist in 1987.
   Seipei was detained for the first time when he was 11 and became
the youngest person held under emergency regulations. He learned to
play chess in detention and tried to keep up with studies that were
interrupted when he left primary school in 1986.
   In 1987, he addressed an anti-apartheid meeting at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand, enthralling his audience and
earning a luncheon invitation from the university's vice chancellor.

   _Murphy Morobe, 32, is acting publicity secretary of the United
Democratic Front and was detained in July 1987. Married, with two
children, he went underground after a state of emergency was
declared on June 12, 1986. During the next 13 months, he remained
active, often showing up unannounced and in disguise at newspaper
offices to give interviews or deliver press releases. He is
considered one of his group's most articulate speakers and writers.
He was imprisoned from 1977 to 1982 after he and other black
student activists from Soweto were convicted of sedition.
   _Mohammed Valli Moosa, 31, is acting general secretary of the
United Democratic Front. He and Morobe, who were detained together,
assumed their positions in 1985 after their predecessors were
arrested on treason charges in a case still pending in court.
   Valli Moosa, of Indian descent, was born in Johannesburg, but
his family was forced to move to a segregated, Asian suburb in 1964
under the terms of South Africa's Group Areas Act. He is married
and has one daughter. Prior to his detention, he visited Europe,
the United States and Canada on behalf of the United Democratic
Front.
   _Vusi Khanyile, 37, is chairman of the National Education Crisis
Committee and also was special assistant to the chief administrator
of the University of Cape Town. He is married, with three children.
He became involved in black student politics in 1972, and was
detained for five months in 1977-78. He received a bachelor's
degree in 1982 from the University of Birmingham in Britain.

<HEAD>THE ORGANIZATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The United Democratic Front was founded in 1983, primarily to
oppose a new constitution that brought Asians and people of
mixed-race into Parliament while continuing to exclude the black
majority. The front quickly established itself as the largest
anti-apartheid group in the country, a loose coalition of about 700
labor, civic, church and educational groups which up to 2.5.
million members. Most of the estimated 30,000 people detained for
varying periods since the 1986 emergency declaration have been
affiliated to the United Democratic Front, and the organization was
banned in February from conducting any activities.
   _The National Education Crisis Committee, also banned in
February, was formed in December 1985. Like the United Democratic
Front, it is a multiracial but predominantly black coalition. It is
composed primarily of parent, teacher and student groups seeking to
give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in their
schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off black
classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the
government outlawed its subsequent campaign for ``people's
education'' and has detained virtually all its leaders.

<HEAD>Thousands March in Protest Against Apartheid, Police Suppression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KING WILLIAM'S TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people
marched through this city to the police headquarters Friday to
protest apartheid and police suppression.
   The independent South African Press Association estimated 20,000
people joined the procession, led by clergymen, while scores of
policemen watched. No violence was reported during the march, which
had received official permission from a magistrate.
   Organizers claimed it was the biggest march since the funeral
procession for Steve Biko, founder of the black consciousness
movement who died in 1977 while in police custody.
   Also Friday, a man convicted in the murder of a schoolteacher
was executed despite an appeal for mercy by the United Nations.
   The Justice Department said Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, 36, a black
member of the outlawed African National Congress, was hanged. He
was convicted in the 1985 killing of Mellina Fass, a black teacher
who apparently defied a school boycott called by anti-apartheid
militants.
   Mrs. Fass, who was in her 50s, was a victim of a ``necklace''
murder _ killed by having a gasoline-soaked tire placed around her
neck and set afire.
   Dozens of blacks considered collaborators with the white
government were killed by the ``necklace'' method from 1984 to 1986.
   The U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, called
on South Africa to commute the death sentence of Boesman and all
other ``political prisoners.''
   The United States and Britain abstained. U.S. Ambassador Thomas
R. Pickering said, ``There can be no circumstances in which a
violent murder such as the one in this case ... could be considered
a rightful political act.'' There have been 39 executions in South
Africa this year, far fewer than in recent years when more than 100
people were hanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black
men, remain on death row.
   About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this
year and are serving prison terms.
   There have been anti-apartheid marches in cities throughout the
country since the Sept. 6 elections. Most have been peaceful, but
police used batons and dogs to stop women from marching in Pretoria
last Saturday because they did not have permission.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told a police parade in the
northern Transvaal town of Hammanskraal on Friday that police had
``no option but to act to curb illegal demonstrations'' such as the
Pretoria march.
   The marches involve the parliamentary elections that excluded
the black majority.
   Anti-apartheid activists say that 23 people were killed in
election-day violence instigated by police. Officials initially
denied responsibility for any deaths but police opened an
investigation and recently said 19 people were killed, including 10
who died in black-vs.-black factional fighting and nine in
incidents where police may have been involved.
   One of the leaders of the defiance campaign, Mohammed Valli
Moosa, was released Friday after being held for 42 days without
charge. He was placed under heavy resrictions.
   Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United Democratic Front,
was one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and
took sanctuary at the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg. The three
left the consulate after the government said they would not be
arrested.
   But police seized Valli Moosa in his Johannesburg office on Aug.
18, days before the United Democratic Front and other organizations
declared they would ignore the banning orders.
   Vlok signed the release order for Valli Moosa. It prohibits him
from being in the company of more than seven other people for any
purpose, talking to the news media, leaving Johannesburg, taking
part in United Democratic Front or Transvaal Indian Congress
activities, preparing anything for publication or leaving his home
at night.

   Five long-exiled leaders of the
African National Congress made an emotional return to South Africa
on Friday to prepare for groundbreaking talks next week with the
white-led government.
   The five, who arrived from the group's exile headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia, will join ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela for
discussions with President F.W. de Klerk's government May 2-4.
   ``As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 27 years
ago, `We are really on the way,''' said Joe Slovo, a member of the
ANC's National Executive Committee. He fled South Africa in 1963.
   ``We who left by the back door ... have now entered the very
front door of South Africa,'' said Slovo, the ANC's highest-ranking
white. ``It's a remarkable feeling.''
   In addition to Slovo, the group included the ANC's
secretary-general, Alfred Nzo; head of foreign affairs, Thabo
Mbeki; commander of the movement's guerrilla wing, Joe Modise; and
head of the women's section, Ruth Mompati.
   The five, who had been in exile since the 1960s, arrived on a
private charter and held an airport news conference.
   ``It is an exciting moment for all of us,'' said Nzo.
``Regrettably, our South Africa is still a bleeding country ravaged
by the apartheid system which continues to divide our people into
warring clusters.''
   Mbeki wept as he stood beside his 80-year-old father, Govan
Mbeki, an ANC veteran who spent 23 years in prison before his
release in 1987.
   About 100 supporters greeted the ANC leaders at the airport.
Hundreds more lined the road outside, waving the banners of the ANC
and its ally, the South African Communist Party.
   Meanwhile, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, 73, quietly left
Sweden on Thursday after a recuperating there since Jan. 3 from a
stroke he suffered late last year, officials in Stockholm said
Friday.
   The Swedish news agency TT said Tambo wanted to return to South
Africa soon, but it was unlikely he would be able to resume an
active leadership role in the ANC.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC in February after a 30-year ban. Many
of the estimated 15,000 members in exile are likely to return this
year. Four lesser-ranking ANC officials returned this week but have
not appeared in public.
   The government promised that the exiled ANC leaders would not be
prosecuted upon returning to South Africa for the talks.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
country's 5 million whites maintain political and economic control,
and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   Next week's talks are designed to clear the way for negotiations
on a new constitution that would include blacks.
   The ANC has said the government must lift the 3{-year-old state
of emergency and release prisoners convicted of politically
motivated crimes before negotiations can begin. The government
wants the ANC to renounce its armed struggle.
   The government has said constitutional negotiations will include
several black opposition groups in addition to the ANC.
   Slovo is general secretary of the Communist Party. About half of
the ANC's top 35 leaders also are Communists.
   In other developments:
   _Police said Friday six people were killed in black factional
fighting in Natal Province during the preceding 24 hours.
   _Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said he plans to introduce
legislation that would end racial segregation of prisons.
   _A former member of the Johannesburg City Council security
department alleged that a military intelligence operative was
responsible for the assassination last year of prominent white
anti-apartheid activist David Webster.
   Hannes Gouws made his allegation at an inquiry into a spy ring
conducted by the city council. No one has been arrested for
Webster's killing.

   Thousands of people of all

   Among the marchers were the white managing director of the
Mercedes-Benz auto manufacturing plant in East London and many of
the company's black employees, who were given the day off to
participate.
   The rally for ``justice, peace and freedom'' was organized by 20
local anti-aparthied groups as part of a nationwide protest
campaign launched in early August. The demonstrations have targeted
segregated schools, hospitals, beaches, buses and other facilities.
   Police estimated today's crowd at between 25,000 and 40,000, and
journalists at the scene gave similar estimates.
   The largest previous government-approved rally was a march in
downtown Cape Town two weeks ago by an estimated 20,000 to 25,000
people.
   In other developments, authorities released a prominent
anti-apartheid activist who had been on a hunger strike, and the
city of Johannesburg formally opened all public facitilies to
blacks.
   There have been a series of mass demonstrations across the
country since President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 that
authorities would not break up lawful, peaceful protests.
   The East London rally was led by David Russell, the Anglican
Archbishop of Grahamstown, along with other local clerics and human
rights lawyers.
   The rally clogged the entire downtown area and most shops closed
for the day. Marchers danced, chanted and sang freedom songs, and
some carried the green, gold and black flag of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Leaders of the rally marched to the headquarters of the security
police and presented written demands that call for the release of
political prisoners, the legalization of banned opposition groups
and the lifting of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   There was a heavy police presence at the rally, including
armored vehicles and a helicopter, but officers stood aside and no
incidents were reported.
   All the approved mass rallies in the past two weeks have been
peaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in the
southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg. In Pretoria, police used
clubs Saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with a
protest march that was not authorized.
   In Johannesburg, white students at Rand Afrikaans University
jeered and heckled about 200 black students who marched today to
protest the segregated dormitories. About 75 percent of the
students at the overwhelmingly white university voted last week to
maintain segregated residences, the black students said.
   In another development, authorities released a prominent
anti-apartheid activist who went on a hunger strike after being
detained without charge last month, his attorney said.
   Trevor Manuel, who was freed Tuesday, is one of the top-ranking
leaders in Cape Town of the banned United Democratic Front, the
country's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   Manuel, who has been detained previously, was held in the
central city of Bloemfontein and refused to eat for two weeks of
his 30-day confinement, attorney Essa Moosa said.
   Before his most recent detention, Manuel was under police
restrictions that limited his movements. Moosa said he did not know
if any new restrictions had been placed on his client.
   Many activists have ignored the police orders as part of the
nationwide defiance campaign.
   The government released hundreds of detainees earlier this year
after they launched a hunger strike, and only a few dozen were
being held without charge in June and July.
   However, a human rights groups estimate that the number has
risen to about 250. More than 30,000 people have been detained
without charge for varying lengths of time under the 3-year-old
state of emergency.
   In Johannesburg, meanwhile, the city formally opened all public
facilities to blacks today after the city council voted to
desegregate buses, swimming pools and recreation centers.

<HEAD>Three Escaped Activists Plan To Emerge From U.S. Consulate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Three escaped anti-apartheid
activists holed up in the U.S. Consulate for five weeks plan to
``call the state's bluff'' and emerge from their refuge Wednesday.
   The activists disclosed their decision Tuesday after advice was
relayed to them from jailed black leader Nelson Mandela. The three
previously had said they mistrusted the government's pledge to let
them leave the consulate without being redetained.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said Monday she discussed the activists
when she met Saturday with her husband, who is recovering from
tuberculosis at a hospital in Cape Town. Mrs. Mandela said she
passed on unspecified suggestions from her husband to the escapees'
lawyers.
   The three activists _ prominent leaders of banned opposition
groups _ have been living in a meeting room at the consulate on the
11th floor of a Johannesburg office building since their escape
Sept. 13.
   The government has said the men are free to leave and will not
be detained again or restricted.
   ``The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave
... to claim their freedom,'' said a statement issued on their
behalf by the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest
anti-apartheid group not banned from functioning.
   The activists' decision ``is a major test of the government's
undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on the
detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' said the
congress, the main black labor federation.
   The three activists are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa,
senior leaders of the United Democratic Front, and Vusi Khanyile,
chairman of the National Education Crisis Committee.
   All had been held more than a year without charge when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a
Johannesburg hospital. Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli Moosa
is Indian.
   ``If the state detains or restricts them, it will deepen the
credibility problems of the apartheid regime,'' the congress'
statement said. ``Government repression has not, and will not,
succeed in destroying the strength and mass support of the
democratic movement.''
   U.S. officials have said they would not force the three to leave
despite a policy of not allowing diplomatic premises to be used by
asylum seekers.
   U.S. officials have maintained a low profile during the episode
and the embassy issued no statement Tuesday. The South African
government also had no immediate comment.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people are in detention, according to anti-apartheid groups.
   The three escapees have demanded the release of all detainees
and protesting the policy of indefinite detention without trial,
which they described as a form of torture.
   Colleagues of the three criticized U.S. officials for barring
the men from direct contact with the news media.
   An activist who escaped to the consulate Sept. 21, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His
lawyers had allege he was tortured while in custody.

   Black activist Winnie Mandela
said today U.S. officials have imposed restrictions on three
anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the U.S. Consulate since their
escape from detention last week.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, commented after visiting the three men at the
consulate in a Johannesburg office building.
   She said U.S. officials in Washington were refusing to let the
three communicate directly with the news media, a condition which
they initially agreed to but now want to change. ``We would like to
see the Americans a little more committed than they are,'' she said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Barry Walkley, said his government was
concerned with the well-being of the activists ``and at the same
time with maintaining the appropriate posture of a diplomatic
mission.''
   ``Establishing a media forum is incompatable with either the
concept of temporary refuge or the functioning of a diplomatic
mission,'' he said.
   ``We agreed that they can convey messages through their legal
representatives. However, using their legal representatives as
intermediaries for interviews goes beyond that agreement.''
   Elsewhere, 11 activists reportedly were detained under
state-of-emergency regulations in Cape Town, where a national
anti-apartheid conference is planned this weekend. In the port city
of Durban, police said 160 people were arrested after hundreds of
striking black dockworkers went on strike.
   Encamped at the U.S. Consulate are two leaders of the banned
United Democratic Front _ Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa _
and the chairman of the banned National Education Crisis Committee,
Vusi Khanyile. They slipped away from guards Sept. 13 at a
Johannesburg hospital.
   They have remained at the consulate despite a government promise
that they will not be arrested or restricted if they leave, and
have called for the release of all political detainees.
   Mrs. Mandela said the three are wary because of a threat by
South African authorities immediately after their escape. She said
the government said it would take ``the most severe measures''
against the men unless they agreed to leave the country.
   Lawyer Essa Moosa said activists taken away from their homes
today included Trevor Manuel, 32, Cape Town leader of the United
Democratic Front. Manuel was detained without charge in August 1986
and was placed under severe restrictions when released in July.
   The detained activists reportedly included at least two whites,
an Indian, several blacks and people of mixed-race.
   Police declined to confirm the detentions, but did report on the
Durban dock strike. According to police, the arrests in Durban came
after strikers, many of them carrying sticks and pipes, staged an
illegal gathering.
   The strike began Tuesday to protest the dismissal of a worker
and to demand higher pay.
   Initial reports from lawyers and relatives indicated nine
activists were detained in Cape Town. But Frank Meintjies of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions said 11 United Democratic
Front activists were detained.
   The anti-apartheid conference is to be held Saturday and Sunday
at the University of Cape Town and is sponsored by the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the country's largest labor federation.
   Organizers are seeking to bring together about 75 opposition
groups, ranging from white, liberal Parliament members to
organizations that advocate black self-reliance.
   ``This is not a conference of people who necessarily agree on
everything,'' Meintjies said. ``But they all agree that the
apartheid problem should be done away with once and for all.''
Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about security force actions and treatment of detainees,
but enforcement of the rules has not been comprehensive.

   Three prominent anti-apartheid
activists, detained for more than a year without charge, escaped
from a hospital Tuesday and took refuge at the U.S. Consulate in a
high-rise office building.
   The U.S. Embassy said it had ``high regard'' for the men and
would not force them to leave against their will.
   Two of the three are senior officials of the now-banned United
Democratic Front _ acting publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, a
black, and acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, an
Indian. The other is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of the
banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   The U.S. Embassy statement confirmed that the three had taken
refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of an office building in
downtown Johannesburg. The building is two miles from the hospital
where they were being treated.
   The main U.S. embassy is in Pretoria.
   Several associates of the escapees later met with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins and they said he assured them the men
would be well cared for.
   The three have asked to meet with their relatives and with
leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, but they have not disclosed
any other requests.
   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to
their detention without charge, and hold them in high regard,'' the
U.S. statement said. ``We will not press them to leave against
their will.''
   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum at
its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable
under international law and may not be entered by the host
government without consent. The embassy said it was discussing the
situation with the activists and the South African government.
   Jay Naidoo, an anti-apartheid labor leader, said he and several
colleagues including Max Coleman conferred with Perkins, America's
first black ambassador to South Africa, and they were assured the
escapees' physical needs would be cared for. Coleman said of the
three, ``They're very pleased to be where they are.''
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,
said the men had escaped from Johannesburg Hospital, where they had
been receiving physiotherapy. No details of the escape were
disclosed.
   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison.
   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force
deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two
dozen journalists waited in the hall for several hours before
dispersing.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.
   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobe
operated from underground, wearing disguises and showing up
unannounced at newspaper offices.
   As one of the United Democratic Front's most eloquent writers
and speakers, he played a key role in conveying the positions of
the nation's largest anti-apartheid group, at a time when most of
its leaders were in jail or in hiding.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge at
some point during the emergency. The government has not released
comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that 802 people who
had been held at least 30 days were still in custody.
   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated
to the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than
600 anti-apartheid groups.
   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum
and policies in their schools.
   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts
that spread nationwide in 1985-86. But when it subsequently
campaigned for ``people's education,'' the government outlawed it.
   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among
17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting
any activities. The U.S. government was among many to condemn these
bannings.
   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic
missions in South Africa. Six United Democratic Front leaders
stayed at the British Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late
1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason. The charges
later were withdrawn.
   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klaus
de Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a Dutch
Embassy office in Pretoria for two years.
   De Jonge escaped into the office from police custody after being
arrested for aiding the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.

   Three escaped detainees
encamped in the U.S. Consulate for more than a month plan to leave
their sanctuary Wednesday, an anti-apartheid labor federation said
today.
   The three prominent activists, who escaped detention Sept. 13,
have been living in the consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown
Johannesburg office building.
   The South African government has said the trio is free to leave
and it will not redetain or restrict the men in any way.
   The decision for the men to leave ``is a major test of the
government's undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on
the detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' the
Congress of South African Trade Unions said in a staement.
   The congress is the country's largest black labor organization
and is a militant opponent of apartheid.
   The anti-apartheid leaders are Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli
Moosa, leaders of the banned United Democratic Front coalition, and
Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National Education Crisis
Committee.
   Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli Moosa is of Indian descent.
   All had been held more than a year without charge when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a
Johannesburg hospital.
   ``The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave,''
the congress statement said.
   ``We do not for a moment believe that the government intended
releasing them and that they somehow pre-empted this by their
escape,'' it added. ``This government line was meant to appease the
U.S. administration and dilute public and international concern
over detentions.''
   U.S. officials have said they would not force the three to leave
despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not allowing diplomatic offices
to be used by those seeking asylum.
   U.S. officials have maintained a low profile during the episode
and U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said he had no immediate
comment on the matter.
   Earlier the activists had said they do not trust the government
and repeated their call for the release of other political
detainees.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without trial for
varying lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency.
About 1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most
are being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment, his
law firm said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Police Investigate Death of 13-Year-old, Winnie Mandela Link</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shooting attack that killed a
13-year-old girl at her Soweto home may be linked to the controversy
surrounding Winnie Mandela, police said Thursday.
   The killing Wednesday night was the fourth in two months
involving people connected to Mrs. Mandela and her unofficial
bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer club.
   Mrs. Mandela's husband, jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, met for more than four hours Thursday with three
anti-apartheid lawyers at a prison farm near Cape Town. One of the
lawyers, Dullah Omar, said no details of the discussions would be
disclosed.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied media speculation that her 30-year
marriage is in jeopardy because of her estrangement from major
anti-apartheid groups.
   Last week, leading anti-apartheid activists accused Mandela
United members of conducting a ``reign of terror'' in the vast black
township outside Johannesburg and said Mrs. Mandela should be
ostracized.
   Police said the Soweto girl, whose name was withheld, was killed
when gunmen fired on her house with AK-47 rifles and set the
dwelling aflame with a firebomb.
   A few hours before the attack, a woman living in the house was
detained in connection with the stabbing death last week of Maxwell
Madondo, a member of the soccer club. Plice declined to identify the
arrested woman.
   ``The possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearing
on the murder of Mr. Madondo and is possibly a revenge attack is
being investigated,'' police said.
   Madondo's body was found near the house that was firebombed. A
former soccer club member, Andrew Ekaneng, has been charged in the
killing.
   Two other people with links to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards
have been slain recently in Soweto.
   Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist, was allegedly beaten at
the Mandela home by Mandela United members. His decomposed body was
found in January. Two members of the soccer club have been charged
in the slaying and the abduction and assault of three men.
   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, an activist, was killed at his Soweto clinic
last month. Two men have been charged in the shooting death, and
police have said they believe the motive was robbery. However, Mrs.
Mandela has suggested Asvat may have been killed because he had
examined Seipei and other youths who she said were sexually molested
by a Methodist minister in Soweto.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, the senior Methodist official for the
Johannesburg-Soweto region, on Thursday reiterated the church's
denial of the sex allegations.
   ``The church particularly resents recent suggestions that it is
involved in a conspiracy with the police to frame the Mandela United
soccer team,'' he said.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied complicity in any wrongdoing, has
suggested that Seipei is still alive, and has asserted the
controversy results from a campaign to discredit her.
   In another development, police banned a rally Thursday intended
to show solidarity with black detainees who have staged hunger
strikes to protest being held without charge.
   More than 300 people, mostly students, had gathered in an
auditorium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg
when police officers entered the hall and said the meeting had been
banned.
   Student leaders, faculty members and administrators from at least
five universities have fasted in support of the hunger strikers.
   Hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that
the government free them or charge them.

   Three psychics and a $50,000 reward didn't work.
In the end, it was a veterinarian walking her dog who found the
bones of a Harvard student who vanished in 1981.
   The discovery of the remains of Joan Webster also renewed
questions about the role of the infamous Leonard ``The Quahog''
Paradiso, a small-time hood doing time for another slaying.
   Paradiso never was charged in the Webster case, in which Essex
County District Attorney Kevin Burke said he ``became a suspect
almost immediately'' after Webster disappeared from Logan
International Airport.
   The case was revived after veterinarian Karen Wolf last month
stumbled across part of a skull in the woods in Hamilton, a wealthy
community 25 miles north of Boston.
   More bones were found after that.
   Confirmation that the remains were Webster's was made Monday.
Authorities said the cause of death was ``blunt trauma to the
head,'' and that Webster was a homicide victim.
   ``That is some measure of relief,'' George Webster said of the
identification. He said he and his wife, Terry, had long believed
their daughter had been slain.
   Joan Webster was last seen at the airport on Nov. 28, 1981. The
native of Glen Ridge, N.J., and Syracuse University graduate was
headed back to the Harvard's School of Design after a Thanksgiving
visit with her parents.
   Webster was a successful and active student who had made the
dean's list at Syracuse. She liked skiing, sailing, tennis and
photography and had traveled widely, her parents said.
   The search for Webster turned up her wallet 300 feet from where
20-year-old Marie Ianuzzi's body was dumped in 1979 in Saugus.
Saugus is 15 miles from where the bones were found. Paradiso was
convicted of Ianuzzi's murder in 1984.
   After Webster vanished, her family and friends offered a $50,000
reward. Shortly after the disappearance, three psychics came
forward, including one who said he envisioned her body was in a
pond in Manchester, about five miles from where her bones were
later found.
   ``It was close,'' said Beverly Police Capt. Gordon Richards, who
was among the investigators in 1982.
   In 1985, attention focused on Paradiso after a former cellmate
alleged that the one-time fish merchant claimed involvement in
killing Webster.
   Timothy Burke, who was Suffolk County prosecutor at the time,
said in an affidavit that Paradiso told an informant he forced
Webster onto his 26-foot cabin cruiser, the Malafemmina _ Italian
for ``bad woman'' _ with a fake .357-caliber Magnum.
   According to the account, he hit her on the head with a whiskey
bottle and dumped her body in Boston Harbor.
   Many people now want to talk to Paradiso, 45, formerly from
Revere.
   Paradiso, who has defended himself in the media in the past, is
not talking much. He did not return a phone call Tuesday, and a
spokesman for the Department of Correction said the Walpole inmate
refuses to speak to reporters.
   It could not be immediately determined if he was currently being
represented by an attorney. His convictions include rape and
attempted murder of a hitchhiker in 1975, as well as the
strangulation of Ianuzzi in 1979.
   He was also found guilty on federal bankruptcy fraud charges for
claiming to be worth $10 when he was working at a lobster company
and had $10,000 in the bank.
   When the prison informant linked him to Webster's disappearance,
Paradiso denied the allegations. He protested his innocence in
writing to newspapers, the district attorney, police and even
Webster's parents.
   ``Now do you think a high-class smart girl like Joan Webster
from a good family, with money, is going to get into a car with a
guy like me smelling of fish?'' he told a newspaper six years ago.
   He sued Boston magazine for $3 million, saying he was libeled in
a story linking him to the Webster case. That suit was dismissed in
1987 by a judge who said Paradiso's reputation was so bad he was
``libel-proof.''
   Kevin Burke, the Essex County prosecutor, indicated Paradiso
wasn't ruled out even though finding the bones in the woods seems
to discount the Boston Harbor theory.
   Shards of metal and glass stuck in Paradiso's index finger,
thought to be part of the fake gun, became the subject of a
protracted and much publicized legal battle over the inmate's right
to keep the contents of his injured finger secret. He underwent
forced surgery but it yielded no new evidence.

   President F.W. de Klerk on
Thursday accepted a proposal by the African National Congress to
send a delegation for the first formal talks between the white
government and its foremost adversary.
   The ANC's commitment to dialogue ``is a positive step,''
reflecting a desire to ``search for solutions through peaceful
means,'' said de Klerk, who lifted a 30-year ban on the guerrilla
movement three weeks ago.
   De Klerk also made his first public statement on a controversy
involving Defense Minister Magnus Malan, who has been linked in
press reports to a secret military unit that allegedly assassinated
anti-apartheid activists.
   The president, interviewed by the state-run TV network, said the
allegations would be thoroughly investigated by a judicial
commission, criticized the press for conducting a ``trial by
media,'' and praised the role of the security forces in saving
South Africa from ``anarchy and chaos.''
   Opposition political leaders demanded Malan's resignation and
urged de Klerk to ensure that no cover-up takes place.
   Malan, in statements this week, denied having ordered
assassinations, but did not rule out the possibility the unit may
have committed such acts. He pledged the military would not
interfere with any investigations.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg quoted sources as saying
Malan had been aware of the unit at least since 1987.
   Police investigators have said in court papers that members of
the unit, called the Civil Cooperation Bureau, are suspected of
involvement in the assassinations last year of David Webster, a
Johannesburg human rights activist, and Anton Lubowksi, a civil
rights lawyer and pro-independence activist in Namibia.
   De Klerk last month ordered a judicial inquiry into charges that
military and police squads murdered government opponents. The
commission is expected to investigate the unsolved killings of at
least 60 activists in the past decade.
   Three former policemen have confessed to serving on death
squads. Several active police officers are under investigation.
   The activists allegedly killed by the death squads include
members and supporters of the ANC.
   Although it was legalized Feb. 2 as part of de Klerk's peace
initiative, the ANC says its guerrilla campaign remains one of its
tactics in trying to pressure the government to end white-minority
domination.
   On Feb. 16, the ANC said from its headquarters in Zambia that it
would send a delegation to South Africa to confer with de Klerk
about obstacles in the way of negotiations on a new constitution.
   The ANC says the state of emergency must be lifted and all
political prisoners freed before such talks can start. Its office
in London released a list Thursday of more than 750 prisoners it
said should be freed.
   No date for the preliminary meeting has been set. De Klerk said
the government would first have to address ``legal uncertainties''
regarding exiled ANC leaders who might be liable for prosecution in
South Africa.
   Earlier Thursday, the government said de Klerk had postponed a
meeting scheduled for Saturday in Zaire with leaders of some black
African nations. The ANC had urged a boycott of the meeting, saying
de Klerk's reforms had not gone far enough.
   While welcoming the ANC's decision to pursue talks, de Klerk
said it was ``disappointing that the ANC leadership continues to
talk about an armed struggle and hostilities at a time when most
South Africans, supported by the rest of the world, want peace.''
   The government ``is committed to a new dispensation which offers
peace and justice for all,'' de Klerk said. ``An armed struggle and
hostilities do no fit into this pattern.''
   Recently freed ANC leader Nelson Mandela helped launch the
guerrilla campaign in 1961, a year after the group was outlawed.
The bombing and sabotage campaign has been ineffectual in the past
year and poses little threat to the government.
   In the port city of Durban, leaders of the ANC and a more
conservative rival movement, Inkatha, opened their first
head-to-head peace talks Thursday, seeking to halt a power struggle
that has killed more than 3,000 people.
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu, arriving for the closed-door talks,
said blacks in Natal Province were ``preparing themselves for
peace'' after three years of savage factional warfare.
   Mandela is expected to appeal for reconciliation when he
addresses a mass rally in Durban on Sunday.
   Sisulu, one of Mandela's closest associates, joined an ANC
delegation that met black community leaders from around
Pietermaritzburg, one of the worst-hit areas.
   The group then returned to Durban to meet an Inkatha delegation
headed by Oscar Dhlomo, second-in-command under Zulu politician
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Both groups depict themselves as foes of apartheid, but Inkatha
rejects the ANC's use of violence and opposes confrontational
protest tactics. The ANC favors a socialist-oriented economy, while
Inkatha favors free enterprise.

   Three anti-apartheid leaders
who escaped to the U.S. Consulate 36 days ago emerged from their
refuge today to test the government's claim that they are free men.
   The activists said Nelson Mandela, serving a life prison term
for his anti-apartheid activities, advised them to leave the
consulate. They pledged to resume anti-apartheid work.
   The government says it will not detain the men again. They had
been jailed without charge more a year when they slipped away from
police guards and fled to the consulate Sept. 13.
   The three _ Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli Moosa, leaders of
the United Democratic Front coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman
of the National Education Crisis Committee _ had been living in a
consular meeting room on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office
building.
   The men grinned broadly as they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting in the lobby of the building. They gave
clenched-fist salutes to cheering supporters, mostly young blacks,
who chanted ``Viva!'' and ``Amandla!'' which means ``power'' in
Zulu language.
   Riot police with truncheons and shotguns were deployed. Officers
sought to keep the crowd under control and police camera crews
filmed the event.
   ``It's great to be out of here,'' said Khanyile.
   ``It is not without apprehension that we have left the
consulate,'' Valli Moosa said at a news conference later.
``Notwithstanding the government's assurances, we realize that we
could be redetained or given harsh banning orders.''
   Valli Moosa said the three were influenced by advice from
Mandela, a black leader who is recuperating from tuberculosis at a
Cape Town clinic.
   ``The view of comrade Nelson Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible, and that assisted us in our
decision to leave,'' Valli Moosa said. He said the advice was
passed to the three by Mandela's wife, Winnie.
   The United Democratic Front is the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition. The crisis committee, a front affiliate,
was formed to seek greater black control over education policies.
Both groups were banned in February, along with scores of other
organizations opposed to apartheid.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.
   The activists said they had cordial relations with the U.S.
Consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``We would like to interpret it as a snub... but there may have
been other reasons,'' said Morobe. He said the three did not
request a meeting with Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador in
South Africa.
   U.S. officials said they would not force the three to leave
despite a U.S. policy of not allowing diplomatic offices to be used
by those seeking asylum.
   About 30,000 people have been detained without trial for varying
lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most are
being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His
lawyers had alleged he was tortured while in custody.
   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobe
operated from underground as chief spokesman for the United
Democratic Front. One of the front's most eloquent speakers and
writers, he played a key role in coveying its positions at a time
when most of its leadership was in jail or in hiding.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   It was unclear whether the government will allow the three
activists to promote their positions freely or whether they will be
restricted in some manner.

   Threats of violent resistance
to even cautious reform of race policies are becoming reality, and a
showdown appears imminent between the government and white
extremists.
   In the latest incident Nov. 15, a white gunman opened fire on
blacks at random in downtown Pretoria, fatally wounding seven
people. Authorities arrested Barend Strydom, a 23-year-old former
policeman linked to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   President P.W. Botha's government, which warned extremist groups
previously, responded by banning the White Liberation Movement, a
small group that has held a few public rallies in the past year. It
is the first white extremist group ever banned in South Africa.
   The White Liberation Movement advocates ``clearing out'' blacks
living in white urban areas. The government described its members as
``fanatical right-wing extremists (who) favor an active form of
violence to take racism to its extreme.''
   Johan Schabort, a biochemist who formed the group in 1985, said
banning it reduces the ``outlet for frustration of white South
Africans.''
   ``Now we cannot control people who are worried about their race
survival,'' said Schabort, who claims about 1,000 members and many
more sypathizers.
   Although no white extremist organizations had been banned, the
government has declared 23 anti-apartheid groups illegal and
detained or restricted hundreds of black activists this year alone.
   Right-wing white groups have increased in both numbers and
prominence in recent years as the National Party government
implemented gradual race reforms and proposed limited power-sharing
with blacks.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs, and the official apartheid policy of race discrimination
preserves power and privilege for the 5 million whites.
   Officials did not say why they acted only against the White
Liberation Movement, which is much smaller than the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement led by Eugene TerreBlanche.
   TerreBlanche has built his organization into the largest of the
far right. Nearly all its members are Afrikaners, the descendants of
white settlers who dominate the government.
   Thousands of rural and blue-collar whites attend the movement's
rallies, at which TerreBlanche delivers spellbinding speeches about
an all-white state and rejects any concessions to the black majority.
   Despite repeated threats, the government has not yet acted
against the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, possibly because of worry
about its vow of violent resistance to any reduction of white
privilege.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said recently: ``There are whites in
this country who can put together a more efficient violent
organization than the African National Congress,'' the main
guerrilla group fighting white domination.
   Asked why the government does not detain whites as often as black
anti-apartheid activists, he said: ``It is not a question of
arresting a few people and that's the end of it.''
   The government portrays itself as a haven of stability in the
increasingly militant struggle by blacks and extremist whites.
   About 170 bombings have occurred since a nationwide state of
emergency was imposed June 12, 1986. Officials have blamed most of
them on the African National Congress, but the targets of several
recent explosions have been anti-apartheid groups.
   ``There should be no doubt that right-wing violence is quite as
evil and destructive as that of the left,'' the government-run South
African Broadcasting Corp. said in a recent editorial.
   Black activists have raised the possibility of involvement by
government security forces in attacks on anti-apartheid activists
and organizations.
   After receiving several death threats in March, the Rev. Allan
Boesak said many anti-apartheid leaders ``have been assassinated in
South Africa. I want the world to know the light of suspicion should
fall on the South African government and the police if something
should happen.''
   Police often boast of their success in capturing ANC guerrillas
and pre-empting their attacks, but have announced no progress in
recent cases of violence widely blamed on white extremists.
   Among them: A bomb destroyed a Johannesburg building that housed
several anti-apartheid groups, fire damaged offices of
anti-apartheid church groups in Pretoria, a bomb exploded in a
Johannesburg disco frequented almost exclusively by blacks and a
fire was set in an anti-apartheid group's offices at the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   The Conservative Party, which opposes all concessions to blacks,
split from the National Party in 1982 and now is the largest
opposition in Parliament. Some of its Parliament members belong to
the TerreBlanche's organization.
   Other groups preaching an all-white homeland are the Boerestaat
Party and the Orangeworkers.
   Hercules Booysen, chairman of the Orangeworkers, said of the
action against the White Liberation Movement: ``The government will
keep on banning organizations until only itself is left.''

   Members of the United Democratic
Front and seven other banned anti-apartheid groups unfurled their
banners at a cathedral Sunday and declared they would defy
government emergency laws by operating openly again.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a multi-racial congregation
of 2,500 in chanting, ``No to apartheid, no to injustice, no to
oppression and no to racism,'' at the church service, which replaced
a planned rally at the mixed-race University of the Western Cape.
Police prevented that rally from taking place.
   The declarations by the anti-apartheid groups, some of which took
place in Johannesburg, are part of a national defiance campaign
organized to coincide with the sixth birthday of the 700-group
United Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition.
   They aim to challenge the government in the weeks before the
Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority.
   Organizers in Cape Town obtained a last-minute Supreme Court
order forbidding police from interfering with the rally at the
cathedral.
   But a similar rally in Johannesburg, also banned, was thwarted
when police blockaded main entrances to the white University of the
Witwatersrand. About 200 protesters slipped through and held a rally
addressed by little-known spokesmen who refused to identify
themselves but declared the United Democratic Front and five
affiliate organizations ``unbanned.''
   After the Johannesburg rally ended, about 50 black youths chanted
and danced on the campus lawn until police moved in with batons and
dispersed them. The independent South African Press Association
quoted an unidentified foreign diplomat as saying police injured
several of the youths and arrested about 20.
   Sources close to anti-apartheid leaders said many of those in
Johannesburg had gone into hiding Friday after police detained
Mohammed Valli Moosa, acting general secretary of the United
Democratic Front, under emergency regulations that allow them to
hold a suspect indefinitely without charge.
   Valli Moosa was a principal organizer of the defiance campaign,
which involves challenges to segregation at beaches, hospitals, in
parks, buses and schools.
   A mobile emergency medical clinic was on standby outside the
cathedral in case of injuries from police action, but because of the
court order the police remained two blocks away, sitting in parked
vans. However, they set up a roadblock on the main highway into Cape
Town and stopped a busload of people from attending the rally.
   Police also prevented students from leaving the campus of the
University of the Western Cape.
   Referring to a police attack Saturday on hundreds of blacks
attempting to picnic on whites-only Cape peninsula beaches, Tutu
said: ``They say apartheid is dead. It is one of the most
extraordinary corpses around.
   ``They had police, dogs and tear gas to stop people from walking
on God's beaches. I have never been more proud of people who are
involved in the struggle for justice and freedom in this country
than yesterday. It is our country and we are claiming what is
ours,'' he said.
   The banner of each organization was unfurled as the group was
pronounced ``unbanned.''
   Zoli Malindi, leader of the United Democratic Front in western
Cape province, defied restrictions which prohibit him from
addressing a gathering. He declared:
   ``The United Democratic Front is unbanned and will continue as if
it has never been banned.''
   Representatives of the organizations, holding the banners aloft,
marched outside the church and then dispersed after the 2{-hour
service.

<HEAD>Last South African Hunger Striker Resumes Eating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last participant in a
hunger strike has resumed eating, ending a protest that helped win
freedom for hundreds of black inmates who were held without charge,
a human rights group said today.
   The Human Rights Commission said the last known hunger striker,
Zelile Zwane, began eating Thursday after being taken to court and
charged with various offenses, including illegal weapons possession
and attempted murder.
   Like the other hunger strikers, many of them anti-apartheid
activists held since 1986, he had demanded the government either
release him or charge him.
   The government said this week that less than 100 people remained
in custody under emergency regulations allowing indefinite
detention without trial. About 1,000 were held in late January,
when hundreds of detainees began fasting in prisons across the
country.
   ``We see what happened as a great victory for detainees,'' said
Audrey Coleman, a member of the Human Rights Commission. ``Through
their united action, they were able to expose the whole system of
detention without trial.''
   However, the commission and civil rights lawyers issued angry
protests today because of reports that former hunger strikers had
been shackled to their beds while recuperating at Johannesburg
Hospital.
   The National Medical and Dental Association, an organization of
anti-apartheid health care professionals, said Thursday that at
least two detainees had been shackled to prevent escapes. Since
September, there have been at least four escapes from hospitals by
detainees receiving treatment.
   Police headquarters declined comment on the use of shackles at
the hospital but said departmental policy allowed such measures.
   The Human Rights Commission says a majority of detainees freed
in recent weeks have been issued with restriction orders. Many of
them are barred from certain political activities, confined to
their homes at night and required to report to a police station
twice daily.
   One former detainee, Chris Ntuli, was killed by unidentified
assailants last week after making his required appearance at a
police station in a black shantytown outside Durban. Civil rights
groups suggested the killers were right-wing vigilantes who were
able to predict Ntuli's movements because of the restrictions.
   Black activists in the Durban area today called for residents to
stay away from work and school in conjunction with a memorial
service for Ntuli. There were unconfirmed reports that two buses
were fire-bombed and that a milk truck was set on fire, killing the
driver.
   The Weekly Mail, a leading anti-apartheid newspaper, reported
today that the decision to free most detainees was made by the
Cabinet against the wishes of the State Security Council, which
includes senior military and intelligence officials as well as a
few Cabinet ministers.
   The Weekly Mail quoted Mark Swilling, a Johannesburg-based
political scientist, as saying it was the first time the security
council was overruled in the 11 years since President P.W. Botha
took power.

   Police used tear gas and clubs
today against activists supporting a boycott of Wednesday's
nationwide elections for segregated municipal councils. Archbishop
Desmond Tutu called for an Election Day fast and appealed to all
sides to avoid violence.
   A bomb exploded today in Potchefstroom, southwest of
Johannesburg, extensively damaging a shopping center and slightly
injuring a policeman, police headquarters said.
   It was the second bombing in as many days and police said the
attacks are part of a campaign by the African National Congress
black guerrilla movement to disrupt the elections. On Monday, a car
bombing in Witbank, east of Johannesburg, killed two people and
injured 42.
   In Zwide, near Port Elizabeth, a black candidate was shot and
killed at his home late Monday by an unidentified assailant, a
local newspaper reported.
   Near Cape Town, more than 30 mixed-race high school students
were injured today in a clash with club-wielding police after they
protested the elections, a school official said.
   At Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, more than
1,000 people staged an anti-election rally. Many of them, including
black activist Winnie Mandela, marched to a campus gate where riot
police ordered them to disperse, then fired tear gas.
   Police said officers were being deployed throughout the country
to guard polling stations.
   The Human Rights Commission, a group opposing apartheid, said in
a report today that the elections ``are taking place under a
blanket of silence generated by the repression of anti-apartheid
activists.''
   The commission said about 300 activists had been detained
without charge since Sept. 1, most of them in connection with the
election campaign. The commission also alleged that authorities
were coercing large numbers of blacks into voting.
   Tutu said those who wish to vote, as well as those who boycott,
``should be free to exercise their choice without intimidation.
   ``I want to make an urgent call for a peaceful response to the
elections,'' the Anglican archbiship said in a statement from
church headquarters in Cape Town.
   ``I call on the government not to provoke violence during the
polling and on all those involved in responding to the elections,
whether supporting or opposing them, not to allow intimidation,''
he said.
   Tutu, along with other black anti-apartheid leaders, have been
calling for a national day of protest and a boycott of the
ballotting for segregated municipal councils.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, called for fasting
and prayer but said the he and other anti-apartheid leaders were
not necessarily calling for a general strike.
   Since a state of emergency was declared in 1986, it has been
illegal to call for nationwide strikes.
   The elections mark the first time South Africans of all races
vote at the same time. The white minority government has spent
millions of dollars on advertising to encourage a high black
turnout, seeking support for its claims that it is extending
democracy to blacks even though it denies them a vote in national
elections.
   There are about 5 million whites and 26 million blacks in South
Africa. Roughly half the blacks live in self-governing homelands
not involved in the local elections.
   Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and
because no candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are
running. Many opposition groups are banned, and most activists view
black town councils as subservient extensions of the
white-controlled central government.
   In the white elections, attention is focused on a showdown
between President P.W. Botha's National Party and the far-right
Conservative Party, which seeks to strengthen segregation laws.
   White anti-apartheid candidates are active in only a few cities.
Their most important battleground is Johannesburg, where they are
underdogs against the National Party in a fight for control of the
city council.

   A sit-in by three prominent anti-apartheid activists at the U.S. consulate here ended yesterday, but their standoff with the South African government has just begun.

   The trio of United Democratic Front leaders emerged from the consulate at noon, challenging the government to keep its word that it won't re-detain or restrict them.
The three had been holed up in a consulate office since Sept. 13, when they escaped from the police after lengthy detentions.
Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, both senior UDF executives, were detained in July 1987, and Vusi Khanyile, the chairman of the National Education Crisis Committee, a UDF affiliate, was detained in December 1986.

   Since their detentions, the government has banned the UDF and has severely restricted most of the organization's prominent members who weren't already in jail.
It is unlikely that the government will let these three go totally unshackled -- they have vowed to continue their opposition to apartheid and to press for the release of hundreds of other political detainees -- but any move against them now would likely heighten the tension inside the country and prompt an international outcry as well.

   The government is trying to improve its image abroad.
It has seriously pursued talks aimed at bringing peace to Angola and independence to neighboring Namibia, which South Africa has controlled in defiance of a United Nations resolution.
At the same time, President P.W. Botha has embarked on a diplomatic offensive designed to improve ties to black Africa.

   At a press conference shortly after they left the consulate, the three said they turned down a government offer to go into exile.
They said they will return to the black community to resume their work as activists "because we believe we have a duty to do," Mr. Morobe said.

   "It is not without apprehension that we have left the consulate," Mr. Valli Moosa said.
"Notwithstanding the government's assurances, we realize that we could be redetained or given harsh banning orders."

   The three said they decided to leave the consulate on the advice of Nelson Mandela, indicating that the 70-year-old leader of the outlawed African National Congress still has a hand in guiding the opposition movement after 24 years in prison.
Mr. Mandela, who is currently recovering from tuberculosis at a guarded clinic near Cape Town, met with his wife, Winnie, over the weekend and sent a message to the trio.

   "We had asked Mr. Mandela for his advice on what we should do," said Mr. Valli Moosa, who was only seven years old when Mr. Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
His advice, Mr. Valli Moosa said, was that the three, through their escape and sit-in, had made their point about the government's practice of detention without trial and that they should leave the consulate as soon as possible and return to anti-apartheid work.

   During their 36-day stay in the consulate, the three held almost-constant consultations with anti-apartheid leaders who dropped by to visit them.
At the press conference, they gave few details of their escape, and when asked why they chose the American consulate, Mr. Morobe joked, "We know of only two superpowers in the world and, of course, the one doesn't have an embassy in South Africa."
The Soviet Union doesn't have diplomatic ties with this country.

   At first, American diplomats here privately expressed delight that the three had chosen the U.S. consulate, saying that it proved that the U.S. still had good ties with the black opposition despite the general impression among South African blacks that the Reagan administration has been too friendly with Pretoria.
But by the end of their stay, relations had soured.

   Anti-apartheid activists were upset that the Americans prohibited the three from making any statements to the press during their sit-in, and the three seemed somewhat offended that there hadn't been a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins.

<HEAD>Black Activists in Hiding As Police Continue Crackdown</HEAD>

   Prominent black activists went
into hiding as police on Monday continued to crack down on a
campaign to defy apartheid laws and emergency restrictions.
   Students at three Natal province universities defied police
banning orders and held rallies to declare outlawed student
organizations would operate openly. Eight students were held briefly
and six were charged with attending illegal gatherings.
   Several hundred sturdents at each university clashed with police
who came to the campuses to halt the rallies, part of a national
campaign to disregard banning orders placed on organizations during
the 3-year-old national emergency.
   Police fired tear gas and turned a water cannon on students and
staff at the multiracial University of Natal-Durban, after a crowd
of more than 1,000 refused several orders to disperse. A student
leader shouting over a megaphone declared the End Conscription
Campaign and the South African National Students Congress
``unbanned'' as he ran from squads of police scattering the crowd.
   Students at the white University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg
encountered police when they marched off-campus with placards
proclaiming the two organizations ``unbanned.'' Police also
disrupted a rally at the mostly-Indian University of
Durban-Westville, where students danced and chanted in celebration
of the ``unbanning.''
   ``The past few days have been marked by a systematic pattern of
repression by the state against the defiance campaign,'' said Cas
Coovadia of the banned United Democratic Front, the country's
largest opposition coalition.
   ``The detention of our leaders and the banning of our meetings
serves to strengthen our spirit of resistance,'' Coovadia said in a
statement. He added that he had gone into hiding, but did not name
any others who had done so.
   There have been reports of several activists dissapearing since
Friday when police arrested Mohhamed Valli Moosa, the acting
secretary-general of the United Democratic Front and a chief
organizer of the defiance campaign. He was held under emergency
regulations that allow police to keep him in custody infefinitely
without charge.
   Leon Mellet, spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, indirectly
confirmed that activists were hiding. ``It is ironic that they unban
themselves and then immediately go underground,'' he said.
   He said ``a number'' of people who had defied the law had been
arrested and ``when they sit alone in a police cell, they must blame
those faceless people who irresponsibly urged them to defy the law.''
   The defiance campaign which began Aug. 2 has been escalating in
the days leading up to Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that exclude
the 28 million-member black majority.
   Police responded by breaking up several weekend anti-apartheid
rallies, including a march by blacks at a ``whites-only'' beach at
Cape Town and a demonstration at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg. The chairman of the Johannesburg rally said major
speakers from the UDF had not arrived Sunday because they were in
hiding.
   Police said an ``unsatisfactorily high'' number of unrest
incidents had occurred over the weekend in the Cape Town area, and
that police would continue to use whatever action neccessary to curb
such protests.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu condemned the police use of
whips, dogs, and tear gas to keep blacks off the beaches Saturday.
   ``In my experience it is the police who have been creating
`unrest.' Whenever they keep away from an event, it goes off
peacefully. Whenever they arrive with their quirts, tear gas and
firearms and try to prevent people from peacefully expressing their
dissent, they precipitate confrontation and violence,'' he said.

Depression, Grief Reign
As Regime Extends Measures

    There are many ways to
measure South Africa's year-old state of emergency. You can
look at the number of people who have been detained, chart
the level of violence or consider the repressive legislation.
   You can also probe the depth of Katherine Mlangeni's sorrow.

   For Mrs. Mlangeni, the state of emergency -- which the government extended last night for as much as one year -- has been a private state of grief that began one year ago tomorrow; her son Bikhie, a leader of a black liberation group, was detained by security police hours after the nationwide clampdown started.
Since then, Mrs. Mlangeni has anxiously waited for word of what Bikhie is being charged with, when he might be released, how he is doing.

   "The worst part is the uncertainty," she says.
"I know they are trying to break him."

   For what must be the millionth time, Mrs. Mlangeni takes a photo of her son from her purse.
Taken weeks before his detention, it shows him in his graduation gown and holding his diploma from Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University.

   "He was going to start law school, but now who knows?" she says.
"Some of them come out of detention and they aren't the same up here."
She taps her head.
"One boy from the neighborhood, we hear, is very bad off.
He used to like poems and music and singing.
Now his friends say he is very different."

   The state of emergency has changed many things in South Africa's black community.
Some 25,000 anti-apartheid activists have been detained, and thousands more are in hiding, leaving the black opposition bereft of direction.
The presence of security troops in the townships creates a climate of fear and suspicion.

   The indiscriminate repression and widespread detention of children (civil-rights groups say between 30% and 40% of the detainees are under age 18) have alienated an entire generation of youths.
The euphoria of two years ago, spurred by the rash belief that the apartheid government was teetering, has been replaced by what one social worker calls a "revolutionary depression."

   The state of emergency has also touched the white community.
Most whites have become obsessed with security.
Some have been outraged by the erosion of democratic freedoms.
The international economic sanctions have pinched some pocketbooks.
But life in the cozy suburbs largely goes on as if the state of emergency had never happened.

   In the cramped and dusty black townships, though, the scars are unmistakable.
"Overall, it's a pretty grim picture in the townships," says Tom Lodge, a specialist on black politics at Witwatersrand.
"The organizations have lost their sense of momentum and motivation.
The state demonstrated it has the firepower, that it can rule by repression."

   Still, the government hasn't quashed the fiery emotions that led to the state of emergency.
The resistance movement is learning to operate underground and is trying to forge a strategy.
New leaders are coming to the fore.
The factors that precipitated unrest -- massive youth unemployment, state intimidation, despair over the future -- are still ticking away.

   "For weeks, even months, things have seemed quiet.
The kids are off the streets and back in school.
The shops are doing regular business," says Nat Molatsi, who lives in a township south of Johannesburg.
"But it's an uneasy quiet.
People are waiting for something to happen."

   This state of anxiety has become the hallmark of the state of emergency.
James, a 17-year-old student who was detained for three months, confides to a psychiatrist treating ex-detainees that he is terrified the police will pick him up again.
"I'm afraid to sleep at home," he says.

   A mother who hadn't heard from her son for months told social workers she was relieved to find his body in a mortuary.
"At least I know where he is now," she said.

   Even veteran anti-apartheid activists are forever fretting that the next crackdown is just around the corner.

   "The society has become fearful and distrustful," says Adele Thomas, director of the Johannesburg Child Welfare Society, which counsels ex-detainees.
"People fear the worst."

   Usually, the worst is detention.
Under the emergency, the government can detain people indefinitely without charge.
Rough treatment and solitary confinement are the penalties for not cooperating with police interrogators.
Normal prison privileges, such as family visits and reading material, can be withheld from detainees.

   "Detention is like pulling up a tree, cutting off its roots, and then putting it back into the ground," says Paul Verryn, a counselor at the South African Council of Churches.
"There is a feeling of total hopelessness, a loss of self-respect and responsibility.
Complete alienation."

   Three young men on the lam, ex-detainees now drifting from house to house, wander into the Johannesburg office of the Detainees' Parents Support Committee.
They have come, briefly, to tell their stories of detention and to catch up with each other on what is happening in their township of Duduza, east of Johannesburg.

   They are "comrades," members of the cadre of young black militants who seized control of township politics in 1984 and pushed the black rebellion further than it had ever gone before.
Now, following their detentions of varying lengths, they have returned to a world far different from the one they knew.

   "It seems like everyone has joined a church choir," says 19-year-old Godfrey, reporting on the taming of his once-radical student organization.
"There's choirs all over the place.
They figure the police won't touch a choir."

   "People are frightened," says Zola, 21.
Archie, also 21, agrees.
"The state of emergency has been a blow.
It has hurt."

   But Archie reckons the state of emergency also has its benefits, in a curious sort of way.
He believes it will make the black opposition stronger.

   "Detention can be an education," he says.
"Before we were detained, we were maybe a little ignorant about what was going on around the country.
We were just concerned about ourselves, our township.
Suddenly, there you are with other comrades and you hear what they have to say.
You come out much more aware."

   He believes this will make the black opposition stronger.
For now, though, the three have to go, although they don't know exactly where.

   "At our age, in just about any other country, we'd be expected to start contributing to society," Archie says.
"But just look at us.
We don't even know where we're heading."

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Lawyer Wounded In Car Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A white South African lawyer who was
jailed for anti-apartheid activities in the 1960s was seriously
wounded Thursday when a bomb exploded in his car, Mozambique's
official news agency reported.
   Albie Sachs's right hand was nearly severed from his arm in the
blast, which occurred as he opened his car door outside his
apartment in downtown Maputo, the agency said.
   Sachs was in very serious condition after an operation, hospital
sources told AIM.
   The news agency said a 33-year-old Mozambican man, Ishmael Nagib
Mussagy, suffered a serious head wound from bits of metal flying
from the booby-trapped car, and the man's 3-year-old son was
slightly injured.
   Sachs, a member of the African National Congress guerrilla
group, was jailed by South African authorities for more than three
months without charge in 1963. He also defended members of the
anti-apartheid group, which was banned in 1960.
   He was one of the few white people who participated in the
congress' 1960 defiance campaign, which urged people to ignore
apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested.
   Sachs left South Africa in 1963 after being released from jail.
He wrote a book about his experiences, ``The Prison Diary of Albie
Sachs,'' which was turned into a play in Britain.
   He worked in Britain before going to Mozambique, where he
lectured at the national university in Maputo until recently. He
works for the Justice Ministry in the capital, AIM said.
   Tom Lodge, a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatersrand and South Africa's foremost expert on the ANC,
said Sachs was not working for the ANC in Mozambique and was not an
officer in the organization, which is made up mostly of blacks.
   The attack is the latest in a series carried out against African
National Congress members outside South Africa. At least six ANC
members have been killed outside the country this year.
   South Africa has denied responsibility for the deaths, although
it repeatedly warns it will cross its borders in pursuit of ANC
members.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's blacks have no vote in national afairs. The whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

   The government on Thursday
banned a national anti-apartheid conference planned for this
weekend, and a fourth activist took refuge in the U.S. Consulate
after escaping from detention.
   Organizers had depicted the Cape Town conference as one of the
most important anti-apartheid gatherings in 30 years. More than 70
groups, with members ranging from black militants to liberal white
Parliament members, had planned to discuss strategies for
countering repression of dissent.
   The ban was part of a crackdown on opposition.
   Earlier Thursday, authorities backed off in the case of the
latest escape by a detainee, who joined three other anti-apartheid
activists holed up at the U.S. Consulate. Police issued, then
withdrew an arrest warrant for Clifford Ngcobo, who escaped
Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and fled to the
11th-floor consulate in a downtown Johannesburg office building.
   Consular officials allowed Ngcobo to remain while his case is
assessed, U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said. The consular
officials earlier provided refuge for three prominent activists who
escaped Sept. 13.
   Zavis said he could not confirm reports that the consulate
turned away a fifth fugitive Wednesday night. Local news reports
said a black man sought by police was refused entry into the
consulate and later was taken into custody under security
legislation.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington
Thursday that the South Africans given refuge agreed not to have
contact with news media as a condition of their staying. This was
so the consulate could continue normal operations and avoid
activities incompatible with diplomatic activity, he said.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela visited the consulate Wednesday
and complained that U.S. officials would not let the detainees
contact reporters.
   Police pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if they
leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
confirmed that a multipronged crackdown against other activists is
under way.
   Across South Africa, more than two dozen activists were detained
or barred from political activities this week, offices of
anti-apartheid groups were raided, and pedestrians and motorists in
urban centers were subjected to random searches.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, spokesman for Vlok, announced the conference
ban. He said one goal of the conference was to promote disruption
of upcoming nationwide municipal elections.
   Activists advocate a boycott of the elections, saying the
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a
white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central
government.
   Mellet said participants in the conference were sympathetic to
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement and were
seeking to fill the vaccuum created by the banning in February of
17 major anti-apartheid groups. The groups included the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition.
   The crackdown comes during an upsurge of bombings, including
five in a 9-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday.
Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a
Johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks at a disco on the other
side of the city.
   The disco owner said three white men left shortly before the
blast without drinking their beer.
   Police have blamed most recent bombings on the ANC. But
activists believe right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force
unit carried out the recent bombing of a Johannesburg building used
by anti-apartheid groups.
   Redman said of Ngcobo: ``He indicates that he is a member of the
United Democratic Front and had been in detention for five months
prior to his escape. He is now in temporary refuge with the three
other ... activists.''
   The three are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of
the UDF, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National
Education Crisis Committee.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The government said Wednesday
that three anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the U.S. Consulate
after escaping detention are free men and will not be rearrested.
   But the lawyer for the trio, who were jailed up to 21 months
without trial, said he received no official word of the
government's stance and gave no indication what his clients planned
to do.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the three were ``not in any
danger of being arrested once they leave the consulate.'' Police
said they would have to issue new orders to detain the men again
but that they have no plans to do so.
   The activists slipped away from their police guards Tuesday
while undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital and made their way to
the consulate in a downtown office building.
   ``We sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate because we failed to
see any justification for our continued detention without trial,''
the three said in the statement. ``We have now resorted to the only
dignified response to our continued incarceration.''
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front, Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe, detained without trial since July 1987, and Khanyile,
detained since December 1986, are black. Valli Moosa, an Indian,
was arrested with Morobe.
   The trio, in a statement released by their lawyer, Krish Naidoo,
called for an end to the 27-month state of emergency and demanded
``the right to walk out of this consulate free of any restrictions,
or the threat of redetention.''
   Naidoo said his clients had not received word of the
government's offer. He said he did not know how the activists would
respond if they received a formal offer of unconditional freedom.
   Naidoo, who met with the men Wednesday, said they gave no
indication that they want to leave South Africa.
   The trio, who also met with family members, were staying in one
small room, but they had a television, videocassette recorder and
their own beds, Naidoo said.
   The Rev. Beyers Naude, a white anti-apartheid activist who also
met the detainees, said, ``Their state of mind is positive and they
are in good spirits.''
   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins met for an hour Tuesday night
with Naidoo and other members of a committee representing the
activists.
   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
conferred with the Rev. Frank Chikane, the black general secretary
of the South African Council of Churches; Jay Naidoo, an Indian
anti-apartheid labor leader; and Max Coleman, a white opponent of
detention without trial.
   Chikane said Perkins promised that the activists' material needs
would be met while they were in the consulate.
   U.S. officials have said the activists would not be forced to
leave their sanctuary against their will despite a worldwide U.S.
policy of not formally granting asylum in diplomatic offices.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman said the embassy remained in contact with
the South African government about the situation.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the emergency, which the white-led
government declared to control widespread black protests.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.

   Three of the most prominent
anti-apartheid activists detained under state-of-emergency
regulations escaped from a hospital today and took refuge in the
U.S. consulate.
   The three men have requested a meeting with U.S. Ambassador
Edward Perkins.
   Two of the men are senior officials of the banned United
Democratic Front _ publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, a black, and
acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, an Indian. The other
is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of the banned National
Education Crisis Committee.
   The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria issued a statement confirming that
the three had taken refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of
an office building in downtown Johannesburg.
   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to
their detention without charge and hold them in high regard,'' the
statement said. ``We will not press them to leave against their
will.''
   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum at
its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable
under international law and may not be entered by the host
government without consent.
   The embassy said it was discussing the situation with the
activists and the South African government.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,
confirmed the incident and said the men escaped from Johannesburg
General Hospital, where they had been receiving physiotherapy. No
details of the escape were disclosed.
   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison.
   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force
deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two
dozen journalists waited in the hall.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 34, were detained in July 1987
after working clandestinely for the front since a state of
emergency was declared June 12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in
December 1986.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency. The government has
not released comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that
802 people who had been held at least 30 days were still in custody.
   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated
to the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than
600 anti-apartheid groups.
   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum
and policies in their schools.
   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts
that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the government outlawed its
subsequent campaign for ``people's education.''
   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among
17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting
any activities.
   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic
missions in South Africa. Six front leaders stayed at the British
Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late 1984 before emerging
to face arrest for high treason. The charges later were withdrawn.
   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klaus
de Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a Dutch
Embassy office in Pretoria for two years. De Jonge escaped into the
office from police custody after being arrested for aiding the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

<TEXT>
   At least 27 black activists,
including leaders of two banned organizations, have been detained
in an apparent crackdown on opposition to Oct. 26 elections,
newspapers reported Thursday.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of several clergymen to
defy emergency regulations by urging an election boycott, repeated
his call Thursday.
   Addressing about 2,000 people at the predominantly mixed-race
University of the Western Cape, Tutu said of next month's local
elections:
   ``Please consider prayerfully what God wants you to do. We want
to urge black people _ do not take part in a process which will
perpetuate your oppression.''
   The archbishop called on whites to join the boycott ``because
the time of white politics is past.''
   Police headquarters declined to comment on the reported
detentions. It also has declined to give details of an
investigation on whether Tutu should be prosecuted for urging an
election boycott.
   The anti-apartheid weekly New Nation said the detentions in the
past two weeks are believed to be part of a government attempt to
stifle opposition to the elections, which will mark the first time
voters of all races go to the polls on the same day.
   Many blacks oppose taking part in segregated local elections as
long as the black majority cannot vote in national elections.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, said the activists
detained this week included Nkosi Molala, president of the Azanian
People's Organization.
   Molala's organization was one of 17 anti-apartheid groups banned
in February from conducting any activities. It espouses the
philosophy of black consciousness, or black self-reliance,
developed by Steve Biko before his death in detention in 1977.
   New Nation said 14 members of the South African Youth Congress,
another of the banned groups, have been detained since last week.
It said all top leaders of the Youth Congress now are in detention.
   New Nation, whose editor Zwelakhe Sisulu has been detained
without charge for nearly two years, said 12 other activists from
the Pretoria area were detained Wednesday.
   Two of them worked for the Community Research and Information
Service, a social service group which has expressed fears about the
life of another black staff member, Stanza Bopape.
   Police say Bopape escaped three days after being detained June
9. His family and associates have not heard from him since, and
fear he may have been killed.
   Security police have seized two tape recordings of a sermon
given by Tutu on Sunday in which he advocated an election boycott.
Such calls are punishable by up to 10 years in jail.
   In his speech Thursday, Tutu explained his defiance.
   ``It is not because Tutu is trying to look smart,'' he said. ``I
have a commitment and a passion for South Africa. We have the
potential of being one of the greatest countries. My passion makes
me able, whatever the penalties, to do what I believe God is asking
me to do.''
