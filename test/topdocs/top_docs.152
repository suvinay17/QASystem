   Smiling grade school students Monday helped
a descendant of legendary seamstress Betsy Ross place a wreath at
her tomb on the eve of Flag Day.
   Greg Scott of Norristown placed the wreath with the assistance
of Chris Amend and Chris Walsh, both 11 amd from Cranford, N.J.
About 100 people gathered around Mrs. Ross' gravesite in the
Atwater Kent Park for the ceremony. Amend and Walsh were among 62
fifth-graders who attended the ceremony.
   Mrs. Ross, according to some historical accounts, created the
first official American flag, sewing a flag with bars and 13
five-pointed stars. The story goes that a special committee headed
by George Washington visited Mrs. Ross in June 1776 and asked her
to sew a flag based on their rough design.
   Mrs. Ross was the official flagmaker for the Pennsylvania Navy.
But the story of the first stars and stripes has never been
authenticated.
   Scott, an administrator at Bryn Mawr College, plays saxophone in
a big band, and says he is not a practicing Quaker; nor does he
belong to any organizations such as the Sons of the American
Revolution.
   But he said he admires his great-great-great-grandmother, who
died in 1836, because she was a rebel.
   ``I do this because Betsy was a pretty cool old girl,'' Scott
said. ``She was no shrinking violet.''
   Mrs. Ross, born Elizabeth Griscom to Quaker parents on Jan. 1,
1752, broke with the Quaker tradition of pacifism to support the
Revolutionary War, he said.
   The ceremony Monday was preparatory to the city's Flag Day
ceremonies on Tuesday, which commemorates the day Congress
officially adopted the flag in 1777.

<HEAD>Huge 13-Star Flag Unfurled As Celebration Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's an unproven legend that Betsy Ross made
the nation's first official flag. But there was little disbelief
among children at her house to start the celebration of the 211th
anniversary of the flag's adoption by Congress.
   A 22-by-45-foot replica of the 13-star flag was unfurled Tuesday
down the side of a building as 30 schoolchildren watched, waving
smaller versions of the flag.
   Just who was Betsy Ross?
   ``She was the one that made the first American flag,'' said Paul
Sherlock, 11, from St. Charles Borromeo School in Cinnaminson, N.J.
   ``By making the first American flag she was like the first real
American,'' said classmate Matthew Kozlowski, 11.
   Ross has received popular credit as the seamstress who made the
13-star flag that was adopted by the Continental Congress on June
14, 1777. The anniversary will be celebrated with a ceremony next
Tuesday _ Flag Day _ in front of the house in which Mrs. Ross
supposedly sewed the banner.
   William Kingsley, director of the house near Independence Hall,
feels there is enough evidence to give Ross credit for the flag. In
any case, he said, she remains an important woman in the nation's
history.
   ``We know she made flags for the Pennsylvania Navy and musket
balls for the Continental Army. She was involved in the life of her
country,'' Kingsley said. ``I think if you took away the incident
of the flag, she'd still be worth knowing.''
   Kingsley said the huge flag was made three years ago in the
courtyard of the house by employees of Humphry's Flag Co., located
across the street.
   On Monday, Greg Scott, a descendant of Mrs. Ross, will
participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of Mrs. Ross
and her third husband, John Claypoole, at a park next to the house.

   At the Betsy Ross House, where Flag Day is a
sacred holiday, those who celebrate the stars and stripes' creation
have strong views about its destruction.
   But stitching an amendment onto the Constitution to stop people
from burning Old Glory had some workers and visitors at the house
knitting their brows with concern.
   ``Patriotism is in the heart and can't be legislated,'' said
Seta Demurjian, 57, of Cherry Hill, N.J., a guide who escorts
people to Philadelphia's historic sites.
   ``Once you start monkeying around with the Constitution you open
up a lot of problems,'' said Ms. Demurjian, who suggested Congress
had more pressing issues to worry about.
   Passion about the issue was re-ignited this week after the U.S.
Supreme Court decided Monday that a federal law making it a crime
to burn the flag violated free speech protections in the Bill of
Rights.
   After the decision, President Bush renewed his call for a 27th
amendment to the Constitution to make flag burning a crime.
   A big celebration is scheduled for Flag Day at the Betsy Ross
House, complete with fife-and-drum corps and the reading of an
essay by 14-year-old competition winner Katie Appleget of Princeton
Junction, N.J., on ``What the Flag Means to Me.''

BASE'S 'BETSY ROSS' FIXES TATTERED FLAGS 
</P>

<P>
Rarely a day goes by without Darla Figueroa glancing at one of the flags 
flapping over the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme and 
wondering whether its seams are still intact. 
</P>
<P>
Known to co-workers as a modern-day Betsy Ross, Figueroa, 34, is not one to 
stand for tattered flags. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't even have to be badly ripped," said Figueroa, a security clerk at 
the construction center. "Someone else might not even notice it needs mending, 
but I can't resist the urge to do some fixing." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa is the base's unofficial flag mender. Since 1985, when she first 
volunteered to trim the frayed edges of the nation's symbol, Figueroa estimates 
that she has fixed about 15 flags. 
</P>
<P>
She began mending flags as a favor for her husband, Chief Master of Arms Luis 
Figueroa, CBC's assistant security officer. He is responsible for maintaining 
the department's three flags. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought one home one day and asked me if I would mind fixing it," Figueroa 
said. "He's been bringing them home ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Her efforts have saved the Navy about $800, she said. Without mending, the 
flags would probably have been burned in accordance with military protocol. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when the military is facing steep cuts in defense spending, Figueroa 
said she is pleased that her efforts are able to save the Navy some money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier and cheaper for me to spend 10 minutes fixing a seam than throwing 
it out or paying a lot of money to have someone else do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa began sewing in junior high school and has made clothes for her 
family. Since moving to Port Mugu in 1982, when her husband was transferred 
from Long Beach, she said she hasn't had as much time for sewing as she would 
like. The demands of caring for her family and holding a full-time job take 
most of her effort, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since making it known that she enjoys mending flags, Figueroa's co-workers have 
begun to call her the "Betsy Ross of the '90s." "I didn't do it for the 
recognition. I just thought it would be a nice thing to do," she said. CAROLYN 
KUSKY

   Leona Tennyson is known as ``the Betsy Ross
of the Prairie'' for her work in assembling the world's largest
quilt. Now, like the original Betsy Ross, she has a fight on her
hands: State officials want to take apart her labor of love.
   ``I will never allow it to be dismantled. I will fight to the
end for that,'' declared Tennyson, a 74-year-old ranch owner and
insurance saleswoman.
   The quilt is shaped like North Dakota and features intricate
details of each of the state's 53 counties and 1,358 townships. It
weighs 800 pounds and measures 85 by 134 feet, 1{ times as long and
wide as a basketball court. Twenty-five to 40 people are needed to
carry it.
   But Tennyson's pride and joy now sits in a heap, stuffed with
mothballs and covered with plastic, in a storage room at Minot
State University's athletic complex. Critics call it a white
elephant, and they say Tennyson is too stubborn to admit it.
   The state Historical Board, which oversees items placed in the
state museum in Bismarck, refused to accept the quilt for display,
saying it was not a historical artifact. The board recommended it
be dismantled so each county could be given its particular section
_ a proposal that angered Tennyson.
   ``It is too beautiful of a piece of work to be torn apart,'' she
said. ``The sections fit together just like sections of land on the
ground.''
   The state Centennial Commission, which gave Tennyson about
$10,000 in expense money for the project, has appointed a special
committee to find a solution to the quilt quandary.
   State Tourism Director Jim Fuglie, a member of the panel, says
he ``pooh-poohed'' the quilt until he walked on it, tracing a path
from his hometown of Hettinger to Bismarck.
   ``Just the incredible calculation to make it fit to scale is
phenomenal,'' Fuglie said. ``My instincts are not to dismantle it.
... I think there is a way to display it. We just haven't found
it.''
   Tennyson, a rusty-haired great-grandmother, lives alone in a
modest home in this town of 100 people just two miles south of the
Canadian border.
   She recently bought a van to haul the quilt to events during the
state's 100th birthday celebration this summer. She probably will
charge $1 to see it, she said.
   State officials rallied around Tennyson when she struggled to
make her quilt the world's largest _ especially when she had to
enlarge it at the last minute to surpass a quilt in Australia.
   Gov. George Sinner held a news conference to promote the
project, and the quilt was displayed on the state Capitol grounds,
as well as in Fargo's civic auditorium.
   The Guinness Book of World Records certified the quilt last July
as the world's largest. A quilt that was assembled in San Francisco
to memorialize AIDS victims was many times larger, but its panels
were laid side by side, not actually sewn together.
   Former Gov. Arthur Link, chairman of the Centennial Commission,
said the dispute over the quilt involves some basic questions _ who
owns it and what possible use could be found for it.
   One solution would be to put it on a huge roller, ``sort of like
an endless towel,'' Link suggested. Another idea is to store the
quilt in an air-tight container and use pictures to explain it.
   Tennyson coordinated the Citizens Centennial Quilt Committee,
which used 7,000 volunteers to cut and assemble the pieces that
eventually became the quilt. Volunteers in each township and county
were responsible for their own sections, and the 53 completed
county sections were sent to Tennyson in Antler, where she and some
local volunteers sewed together the completed quilt.
   ``Some feel she got paid for it so it isn't hers. ... She's very
set in her ways,'' said bartender Madonna Eide in Antler, where
Tennyson and her quilt are a popular conversation piece.
   But letters Tennyson receives from people across the state _ one
woman suggested each resident of the state donate $1 to construct a
building for the blanket _ convince her that the quilt should never
be dismantled.
   ``I don't think you call that being stubborn. You are just
standing up for your rights,'' she said, smiling.
   North Dakotans should be proud they sewed the world's largest
quilt, the seamstress said.
   ``They (officials) have to sign papers that that quilt will not
be taken apart before I turn it over (to them),'' she said.
   ``That's my baby.''

KING NOW THE RULER OF LPGA; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: SHE HAS ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT NANCY LOPEZ, WHO TURNED PROFESSIONAL THE 
SAME YEAR, IS A MORE POPULAR PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Betsy King has been playing professional golf long enough that five years ago a 
set of her famous-label irons sold for $25 at an Irvine garage sale. 
Unfortunately, her swing didn't come with the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
So, while some have struggled to learn how to swing a King, few know more about 
King than that she has a good swing. This is partly because she started on the 
LPGA tour in 1977, the same year as one of the most popular golfers of all 
time, Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was a star from the start, winning nine tournaments in 1978 and eight in 
'79. She had 27 victories before King earned her first. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez not only won more, she smiled more and talked more than the quiet, shy 
King. Then Lopez married a baseball player and had a couple of babies. 
</P>
<P>
And King? "I had a very good rookie year," she said Wednesday at the Los 
Coyotes Country Club in Buena Park, where the LPGA tournament begins today. 
"And it would have won rookie of the year in a lot of other years. But there I 
am, in the same rookie class as Nancy. It's timing, and it's obviously not 
something you can control." 
</P>
<P>
From 1977 through '83, Lopez earned more than $1 million, King $328,839. To 
date, Lopez has 42 career victories to King's 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I resented it somewhat, but not anymore," King said. "Now I cheer for 
everyone, and it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, King has not only earned $771,000 more than Lopez, she has finished 
first or second on the money list four times to Lopez's one. She ranks ahead of 
the third-place Lopez on the career money list by $50,000. "The purses are 
bigger now," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season was King's best as she won six tournaments and $654,000. That was 
the most money ever earned in one season on the LPGA tour until Beth Daniel 
broke the record this year. This season has been nearly as good. She has won 
three tournaments, including two majors, and is third on the money list with 
$470,760. 
</P>
<P>
And lately, King seems to be talking more. 
</P>
<P>
When asked recently how she felt about public acceptance of women's 
professional golf, she complained about the media, who rarely write about her. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of (the problem) is the media is dominated by males and -- I hate to say 
this -- they often send the middle-of-the-barrel reporters to cover our 
tournament, or guys who do hockey in the winter," King told the Hartford 
Courant. 
</P>
<P>
"Once last year, after I'd won four events, someone asked me, 'What kind of 
year you having?' Ever hear a pitcher with a 20-4 record asked what kind of 
year he's having?" 
</P>
<P>
Camera crews were stacked up four deep behind King and Lopez Wednesday before 
they began play in the pro-amateur tournament at Los Coyotes. By 11:40 a.m., 
King had given six interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I am getting more fan recognition now," King said. "Last year made a 
big difference, My first good year was in 1984, and I played well for a few 
years since then. And it's been interesting that quite a few of the wins that I 
have had have been on television. All three this year were televised, and at 
least four or five of my six wins were on television last year. That's your 
only chance at a really big audience." 
</P>
<P>
King said the turning point in her career actually came in 1980, her worst 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Several things happened that year -- at the beginning of the year I became a 
Christian, and then went on to have my worst year -- but that has helped me the 
most," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I was a Christian, I put my self-worth on how I did on the golf course. 
I don't have to do that anymore. And with that perspective, it allows me to be 
bolder in my play." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1980, King hired Ed Oldfield as her coach and credits much of her 
success to him. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 35, the most famous female golfer from Reading, Pa., is learning how to 
deal with all of the increased attention. 
</P>
<P>
"After you do 100 interviews, you do get better at it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
LPGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, No. 4 this season on the money list with $439,076, has 26 career 
victories and needs four more to get into the LPGA Hall of Fame. She would be 
the first player to enter the Hall since Nancy Lopez in 1987. Bradley is the 
No. 1 career money leader with $3,305,105, followed by Betsy King with 
$2,940,454 and Lopez with $2,885,221. Bradley is also the only golfer to have 
won all four modern majors, three of them in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After the top four -- Beth Daniel with $661,578, Patty Sheehan with $640,751, 
King with $470,760 and Bradley -- there's a big drop to No. 5 Rosie Jones with 
$319,391. Lopez had this explanation Wednesday of why the top four players are 
so far ahead: "With players of that quality, once they get on a roll, they have 
the confidence and are just going to go ahead. Once one is doing it, the others 
fight to keep up." . . . Daniel and Sheehan are not playing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the tournament is $10 today and Friday, $12 Saturday and Sunday. 
Parking is at Hughes Aircraft Co. on Melvern and Gilbert avenues, and a shuttle 
is provided. There is no parking available at the course. . . . A field of 144 
players will tee off today, including Amy Alcott at 9 a.m., Juli Inkster at 
9:10, Lopez and Bradley at 11:50, and King and Jan Stephenson at 12:30 p.m.

SAILING: LIBBIE KAMISUGI HOPES TO BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN TO ENTER THE 
MALE-DOMINATED WORLD OF AMERICA'S CUP RACING.

<P>
Ever since she was 12, Libbie Kamisugi had dreamed of making an ocean crossing 
in a sailboat. Now she is on the verge of making a historic crossing, entering 
the male-dominated world of America's Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it was beyond my vision," Kamisugi said Friday afternoon on board the 
12-meter America II in San Diego Bay. "I never thought I'd have the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before Philip Freedman, chief executive officer of the Betsy 
Ross group, announces his choice of skipper for the syndicate's entry. But 
Freedman has made it clear that Honolulu's Kamisugi is the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
"I have files on five women," Freedman said. "We looked at all the best 
professional women, and we felt because it will be the first time a woman 
skippers an America's Cup boat, we had to have the most experienced one." 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi has finished three Los Angeles-to-Honolulu TransPac races, finishing 
second in her class last year and fourth overall in 1983. She has sailed in 
many major regattas and was one of the first International Offshore Rule racers 
to receive major sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman said Kamisugi is well-suited to handle the heavy scrutiny the first 
female skipper in America's Cup competition would most likely face. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to be put under a microscope," Freedman said, "but she's not 
intimidated. She'll be one tough cookie." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman is being scrutinized already. Critics say he's trying to attract 
greater sponsorship, and publicity, by fielding a boat skippered by a woman and 
with several female crew members. 
</P>
<P>
"People say we're doing it to get sponsors, but so far, our sponsors aren't for 
women's products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman notified Kamisugi six weeks ago of his intention to have a woman on 
one of his boats -- the Betsy Ross group plans to race two -- for the 1992 
America's Cup. She was quick to tell him she wasn't interested in a crew 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"She said to me, 'I'm not a crew member, I'm a driver,' " Freedman said. "I 
like that she's not petite and quiet like you think she is." 
</P>
<P>
But petite she is. At 5-feet-4, 115 pounds, Kamisugi said she even hopes to 
shed a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely strong for my size," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi said he began lifting weights as the result of a conversation she 
overheard in the early 1970s. Before she made her first TransPac crossing, she 
was bothered when she heard a sailor talking about the dangers of a woman 
competing in such a race. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd never take a girl on TransPac," Kamisugi said. "He said he could 
just see himself falling overboard, and this little fragile hand with finger 
polish is going to pull him out? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that. I said to myself that I'm going to be as strong as I can be 
because that could happen. If you weren't strong enough to hold onto someone, 
they could die. I took that very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
While she does have polish, it's in her sailing and not just her nails. 
</P>
<P>
Said one crew member on board America II: "I've followed her career for five 
years now, and she's good." 
</P>
<P>
The Betsy Ross will be the first time a U.S. boat in the America's Cup will be 
named after a woman. Freedman said he came up with the name when he considered 
Ross' role in the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a first," Kamisugi said. "Provided the performance is good, it'll show 
that women aren't really disadvantaged in certain positions on sailboats. I 
think there's a place for men on boats, but there's a place for women, too." 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi grew up in Chicago and began sailing in small boats on Lake Michigan 
when she was 11. At 15, she won her first championship against men. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never raced with or against women, I've always raced with and against 
men," she said. "I grew up with a mixed identity. I didn't know I wasn't 
supposed to do those things. My father always told me there wasn't anything I 
couldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
Neither is Kamisugi as serene as she appears to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a very pushy leader," she said. "I speak softly, but it's not that I 
don't take control. I do, but I run a democratic ship compared to many." 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi traces her reputation to tenacity and a willingness to learn from 
those around her. When she first started sailing big boats in Honolulu, she 
challenged herself to sail the short distance to the island of Hawaii and not 
get sick. She accomplished that goal in part. 
</P>
<P>
"I got good at being sick," she said. "I kept doing it until I got used to 
getting sick. It's not like I don't have the same problems as other people do 
(at sea), it's just a willingness to stick out there and suffer." 
</P>
<P>
And she isn't too proud to surround herself with experts and learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever possible," she said, "I will take on board my boat the very best 
sailors I can get. I welcome their input. I try to profit from their experience 
so when I get off, I'm better than when I got on."

<HEAD>Tots Think Barbara Bush Sewed The American Flag</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Fourth of July celebrates somebody's
birthday, George Washington is ``nice and he's dead'' and the
original Stars and Stripes flag was sewn by Barbara Bush, according
to a poll of youngsters.
   More children age 4 to 6 think Mrs. Bush was the flag's
seamstress than Betsy Ross, with 29 percent casting a vote for the
president's wife and 15 percent going with the real McCoy.
   Hoping for a story like this, a toy company surveyed 151
children at day-care centers in Boston, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Denver
and Los Angeles to find out how much they knew about Independence
Day.
   The poll was taken by the Pawtucket-based toymaker Playskool Inc.
   When asked from whom the United States gained independence, the
kids gave answers ranging from ``the King,'' at 56 percent, to the
Indians, 19 percent, the Pilgrims, 18 percent, the Russians, 5
percent, the British, 2 percent, and the Italians, 1 percent.
   When questioned about the meaning of the Fourth of July, 18
percent of the youngsters, who were polled in February, said it was
a holiday _ but weren't sure which one.
   ``It's somebody's birthday,'' said a 4-year-old boy from Denver.
   ``It means celebrating the presidents and they're all very
special,'' said a 6-year-old girl from Boston.
   More than anything else, the children thought July 4 had
something to do with fireworks. While 21 percent said that, none
knew the holiday commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of
Independence.
   Fifty-one percent knew George Washington had something to do
with the presidency, and two kids from Atlanta knew he appears on
money, but others drew their own conclusions.
   A 6-year-old boy from Cincinnati thought Washington was a statue.
   ``He's nice and he's dead,'' said a 5-year-old boy from
Cincinnati.
   ``He was a captain who fights the bad guys,'' said a boy, 5,
from Los Angeles.
   In fact, it was Washington who on Jan. 2, 1776, raised the first
American flag, in Cambridge, Mass. Some kids gave him more credit
than was due _ 3 percent said he made the first flag.

<TEXT>     Union City throws its second annual Octoberfest today at Kennedy Park to
toast German beer, music, sausages and costumes.;   Ardenwood Historic Farm in
Fremont makes hay out of the day with its fourth annual scarecrow contest
today.;   All the events are free.;   "You could come here and spend a weekend
doing a lot of wild stuff," said Jill Stavosky, who is helping organize Union
City's Octoberfest. "We're telling people to go to everything this weekend
instead of trying to choose. There's a lot going on.";   The Octoberfest --
modeled loosely after the famous event in Munich -- features a half-dozen
types of beer from Winchester Brewing Co. of San Jose and Carlsberg breweries.
A roving German band will play polka, waltz and oompah music. Food booths will
serve sausages and sauerkraut.;   At 1 p.m., revelers can compete in two
costume contests -- one a King Ludwig look-alike contest in honor of an
originator of the famous Munich beer festival, and one to choose the best
German costume.;   There will be booths with crafts, a performance by the
Joanne Brown dancers and commemorative T-shirts and beer mugs.;   Octoberfest
runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today only at the park, 1333 Decoto Road.;   A few
miles away, Newark will mark the beginning of the monarch butterfly migration
season with the Monarch Festival from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days at Jarvis
Avenue and Newark Boulevard in front of the Newark Marketplace shopping
center.;   It features crafts, food booths, entertainment, horse and buggy
rides -- and maybe even some butterfly sightings. It also offers appearances
by "Monarch Man," a park employee who dresses in a butterfly costume and talks
to children about the graceful flutterers. He'll show up about 11 a.m. and
again in the afternoon.;   Real monarchs are known to stop each migrating
season at a large eucalyptus grove, which is now split by the freeway and the
shopping center, providing ample reason to celebrate, said Marilyn Prows of
the Newark Chamber of Commerce.;   And in Fremont, Ardenwood Historic Farm and
the J.B. Perry Farms will host the Ardenwood Scarecrow Contest at 10 a.m.
today. In that event, public and private preschools and elementary schools
compete to see who can build the best figure of hay. Each scarecrow must
represent a famous person in history.;   Last year, winning scarecrows
included depictions of Martha Washington, a pilgrim couple, Betsy Ross,
Sitting Bull and Marie Antoinette.;   The winning schools get prizes,
including field trips. And the scarecrows will stand amid the cornstalks until

<TEXT>
   Students can take a short and somewhat
quirky stroll through history at the Rollins College Walk of Fame:
600 slabs and chunks of stone recalling famous people through the
centuries.
   There's a stone from the cathedral crypt in Havana that once
held the remains of Christopher Columbus. There's a slab of worn
flagstone from the east portico of George Washington's home at
Mount Vernon, Va. There's a bit of stone from Atlanta donated by
the family of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King.
   Honored are half the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
most of the American presidents, flagmaker Betsy Ross, composer
Richard Wagner, Aristotle, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
   Most of the rocky memorabilia were collected by Hamilton Holt,
president of the the small private college from 1925 to 1949.
   Holt, a wealthy New Englander who was active in the world peace
movement that led to the formation of the United Nations, had
friends around the world who helped with his hobby.
   Adm. Richard Byrd brought a souvenir from the mountains of the
South Pole and presented it to the campus himself in 1938.
President Harry Truman joined Holt for a stone-laying ceremony in
his honor on March 8, 1949, after receiving an honorary degree.
   ``The stones ... are of no intrinsic value,'' Holt once wrote,
``yet each one of them is eloquent with suggestion and
inspiration.''
   Each of the geological souvenirs has been carefully set in a
slab of concrete engraved with the name of the person it represents
and the place where it originated.
   For years the stones were part of an asphalt pathway and were
actually walked on, defaced and weathered. But they have recently
been cleaned and restored and set off from the walkway itself by
concrete borders.
   The landscaped Walk of Fame was rededicated on its 60th
anniversary this past weekend.
   Not everyone proposed for the walk has actually been honored.
   In 1945, someone donated a stone from the fireplace of Adolf
Hitler's bunker in Berlin. Holt accepted, planning to use it in a
``walk of ill fame.''
   But either Holt or a successor thought the better of the plan,
and the Hitler relic has been lost.

JIM MURRAY: CONSISTENCY MAKES KING QUEEN OF LINKS

RANCHO MIRAGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's no secret golf is facing an identity crisis. A different winner every 
week, relays of faceless college kids who have not yet learned how tough a game 
it is, taking over on the tour with all these seagoing, no-brainer putts and 
miracle shots out of trees. 
</P>
<P>
The game looks in vain for a star. It waits for one to crash out of a pack that 
has become about as easy to pick an individual out of as a crowd shot. 
</P>
<P>
There used to be readily identifiable faces. Swings. Players whose 
accomplishments stood alone, who were larger than life, golfers whose names 
made crossword puzzles, cereal boxes, who had their own lines of golf clubs. 
But the sport has become more a lottery than a game. 
</P>
<P>
Except for this one player who seems to be coasting quietly along, winning a 
tournament or two a year, piling up recognition points, appearing on TV cameras 
with some regularity. 
</P>
<P>
This player doesn't attack the course the way Arnold Palmer did. The strategy 
is to romance it, not wake it up. Go for the fat part of the green, play around 
trouble, take the percentage shot rather than the longshot. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite? Who said anything about Tom Kite? We're talking Betsy King here. It's 
not only men's golf that is suffering from an overdose of anonymity but the 
women's game as well. 
</P>
<P>
Men's golf used to have Hogan, Snead, Nicklaus, Palmer, Trevino; and even 
earlier, Jones, Sarazen and Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
Well, women's golf used to have Babe Zaharias, Patty Berg, Glenna Collett Vare, 
Louise Suggs, Mickey Wright. Now, it seems to have a whole bunch of women named 
Penny, a few Lynns and Amys and Pattys -- but the only player the public will 
recognize on sight is Nancy Lopez. They all seem to have gone to Furman, and 
they all play the game like a card player who keeps hoping for a pair of aces 
but keeps turning over treys. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King stands out because she has discovered how to a) make money and b) 
win. Since 1984, Betsy has hit the winner's circle 16 times. Not even Nancy 
Lopez can match that gaudy streak. In that string, she has won $1,623,719. She 
has already won twice this year, beating Lopez by six shots in the year's 
opening tournament in Jamaica and shooting a 14-under-par to beat Jane Geddes 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy is not surprised. She thinks she has the best two instruction books in 
the world -- the Old and New Testament. They don't tell you how to hit a wood 
shot over water. But they tell you what to do when the shot doesn't come off. 
Smile. And go on to the next one. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy does not entirely rely on Scriptures for her birdies. She has her guru, 
as do most women on the LPGA tour. Hers is the taskmaster, Ed Oldfield, who is 
of the old school who believes the real secret of golf is hard work. 
</P>
<P>
In grade school, Betsy King was about as unlikely a candidate for future 
stardom as ever picked up a nine iron. Never mind the braces on the teeth, the 
skinny legs. The Coke bottle glasses made it appear as if the only way she 
could read a break on a green was by Braille. Her eyesight varied from 20/200 
to 20/Terrible. She used to play golf in her native Pennsylvania with a brother 
who became an outstanding amateur player and, briefly, a pro, and then a 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Golf was an important outlet for a young girl who was shy, bespectacled, very 
apt to blush. Some girls take to reading Charlotte Bronte in those 
circumstances. Betsy took to reading greens. She got good enough to become the 
low amateur (and eighth overall) in the 1976 U.S. Women's Open. At a prom, she 
might have been a wallflower. On a golf course, she was a belle of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Soft contact lenses only made Betsy King better. A chronic tinkerer with her 
swing, she pieced together one which other members of the tour say is as 
compact and glitch-proof as, say, Gene Littler's. Betsy is not so sure. "I take 
a swipe at it," she insists. "I'm a striker of the ball, not a picture 
swinger." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever she is, it works. For seven years, she wore out driving-range tees 
while her game seesawed to where she just about broke even on the tour. Once 
the log jam broke, Betsy was one of the ones to beat week-in and week-out. She 
was as steady as a heartbeat, won two to four tournaments every year. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents sent her to Furman because South Carolina seemed just far enough 
from the fleshpots of Philadelphia for a young woman, but Betsy was hardly the 
disco type anyway. Golf was her only true love. A green was the only dance 
floor she wanted to shine on. 
</P>
<P>
The rap against women players is they are inconsistent. Betsy is so consistent 
it makes people sick. 
</P>
<P>
She plays position golf. She doesn't play that 
hit-it-find-it-and-go-hit-it-again game. They used to say Hogan had three 
fairways, right, middle and left. The rest of the world saw one. Betsy's game 
is not refined to the point she sees three corridors to every green, but she 
does not close her eyes and swing, either. "I try to think of the next shot," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't always make for birdie-binges. But it pays the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Consistency looked as if it were going to have a bad week down here at the 
Nabisco Dinah Shore as Betsy opened with an un-Kingly 73-75 or four-over-par. 
But, order was restored in the Kingdom Saturday as she shot the day's low round 
-- 68 -- and vaulted over several players in the treacherous winds that raked 
the Mission Hills course. She may not win but she will, as usual, be in the 
photo. At least, women's golf may have found its King -- in name as well as in 
deed.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Decision Revives Flag Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two huge flags were being unfurled in New York City and tiny
banners were being planted on lawns in a Minnesota town for Flag
Day today _ a practically forgotten holiday until the Supreme Court
helped stir affection for Old Glory.
   Shopkeepers reported flag sales are up as well since the high
court on Monday struck down a federal law against flag burning. The
ruling has spurred the drive for a constitutional amendment against
desecrating the flag.
   In Philadelphia, 14-year-old Katie Appelget was to read her
winning essay in the annual ``What the Flag Means'' contest. The
ceremony was sponsored by the museum and home of Betsy Ross, who
legend has it made the first Stars and Stripes.
   ``The American flag unites us all,'' wrote Katie. ``Even though
we may speak different dialects or come from different backgrounds,
we share one common element, the American flag.''
   Two 20-by-30-foot flags were to be hoisted today at the site of
the 1964 World's Fair in New York City, the first time flags of
that size have been flown since the fair.
   Later in the day, 100 newly arrived Soviet Jews were to be given
American flags and a boat ride past Ellis Island and the Statue of
Liberty, courtesy of a tourist boat company and the New York
Association for New Americans.
   In Northfield, Minn., some 25 workers at a realty planned to
place 3,000 plastic flags on residents' lawns. Broker Millie Berg
said city officials and police have given the go-ahead, but
flag-planters will skip the homes of two people who complained.
   Not everyone in the town of 10,000 was happy with the
``intrusive political statement,'' as resident Gloria Stier put it.
   In Omaha, Neb., merchants said flag sales have been booming
since the Supreme Court ruling.
   ``A lot of it has to do with the flag controversy,'' Paul
Cullen, sales manager at Cosgrave Church Goods, said Tuesday.
   Cullen said the store sold 40 flags in two days this week,
compared to just five on an average day. Although sales increase
around Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, he said, customers
usually forget about Flag Day.
   Buyers this year seem to be ``making a statement'' by buying
flags for Flag Day, said Dave Anderson, owner of Anderson Catholic
Supplies.

are never out of style, particularly around the Fourth of July, but it's
doubtful the selection of home furnishings in red, white and blue has ever
been as plentiful as it is today. Consider dinner plates, coffee mugs,
tumblers, pitchers, trays, ice buckets, napkins, napkin rings, place mats,

<TEXT>     There is even a flag garage door.;    "It was my wife's idea," says Thomas
Hauck of the American flag he and his son-in-law Tim Anderson painted in late
December on Hauck's garage door in Sunnyvale as a gesture of support for the
troops in the Persian Gulf. "We have a corner lot on Heron Avenue facing
Homestead Road and we had flags flying. Jo said, 'Why don't you just make the
whole garage door a flag?' We thought we'll give it a shot, what the heck.";  
 Hauck and Anderson, partners in TRH Painting Services, spent close to two
days on the job. While work was in progress, an Amsterdam television crew
stopped by to film them, and the finished door has since appeared in local
newspapers and on television stations.;    "The reaction has been
overwhelming," Hauck says. "Mothers with kids over there, and wives, came by
to have their pictures taken with the flag background. We've had GIs come back
and knock on the door and thank us, and we've gotten more than 150 letters in
the mail from veterans and others thanking us.";    In spite of the favorable
reaction, Hauck says he's had no requests to duplicate the flag door -- a job
he estimates would cost about $450.;    Most people prefer their flag decor on
a smaller scale.;    Mary Emmerling, author of several books on American
Country antiques, cooking and decor, says she's been collecting flag-motif
items for more than 20 years.;    "I grew up in Washington, D.C., and I always
loved the flags and parades," she says. Today, Emmerling's summer home in
Bridgehampton, N.Y., has a flag gate to greet visitors. She says she doesn't
like to "shout" her passion, but stars and stripes are visible in her home,
from beach towels to quilts to a salad bowl. Emmerling wears a wardrobe of
flag-motif clothing, from jackets to sweaters to socks to shoes, and even her
dog, Star, wears a flag-patterned collar.;    The American flag is appealing,
Emmerling says, because "it makes you feel good. It's cheery and it makes you
feel like a celebration is at hand -- a picnic or the Fourth of July.";   
Emmerling has witnessed the flag's rise in popularity in the two years she's
been working on "Mary Emmerling's American Country Flags" book, due this fall
($15, Clarkson Potter). "It's easy to do this book now, but it was hard two
years ago," she says. "People would just put out flags for the Fourth of July
and Memorial Day, but now they're just leaving them out.";    Emmerling can
thank the recent upsurge in patriotism for much of this, says Elbert
Erlebacher,  professor of history at De Paul University in Chicago. The flag,
he says, is a way of "people showing their feelings about the country. It
usually enjoys a big increase in popularity in times of war, or after a
victory in the wake of a war.";    In addition to wars, Erlebacher points out
that flags enjoy a popularity upsurge around anniversaries such as the 1976
bicentennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the more
recent 1986 centennial of the Statue of Liberty. "You can look at pictures of
parades and exhibits and see the single most frequent decoration is bunting in
flag colors," he says.;    Red, white and blue bunting evoking the feeling of
the flag is typical of the route manufacturers take in offering stylized
interpretations, since displaying an exact reproduction of the U.S. flag in
any form other than a flag is illegal.;    While Desert Storm goosed the
flag's popularity, much of the merchandise hitting store shelves was designed
far in advance of that conflict.;    Always a trend initiator, Ralph Lauren's
fondness for flags pre-dated the Persian Gulf war and obviously spurred others
in the industry to follow suit. He used stylized American flags in his fall
1989 clothing collections for both men and women and has used flag motifs in
his tabletop line since last year. This spring the Polo USA pillowcase,
oversize "Betsy" towels and napkin rings joined the existing place mats and
napkins.;    Sales of the "Betsy" line have been year-round and country-wide,
according to Lauren's office.;    "Beyond its symbolic associations, the flag
is a timeless, beautiful graphic," says John Idol, president of the Ralph
Lauren Home Collection. "The bold lines and crisp colors of the stars and
stripes have an enduring, familiar appeal.";    Nancy Trainor, president of
Avery's of California in San Jose, says, "It's a trend in the industry that
started more than a year ago. Manufacturers can't produce dinnerware overnight
like they do T-shirts.";    Trainor says she placed orders in January for the
flag-motif tumblers, trays, bowls, ice buckets and coffee mugs she's selling.
"We always bring in red, white and blue goods for Memorial Day and the Fourth
of July. I bought more goods this year and we're selling more.";    Alice
Schnapier, vice president of advertising and sales promotion for Fieldcrest,
says the company's "Flag Quilt" blanket throw is part of a "revival of things
American and the brightness of the red, white and blue.";    The $50 flag
throw due in stores in August has had "a very, very positive reaction" among
retailers, she says, but thus far Fieldcrest is confining the stars and
stripes motif to the blanket. "We haven't done anything in bedding ensembles
or towels, but at the last market we did a wall of towels in red, white and
blue picking up the flag colorations," Schnapier says.;    Many Old Glory
items are transitory in nature, but one that is clearly meant to become a
family heirloom is the American flag-motif cedar storage chest from Lane. The
front of the chest re-creates one of the most famous pieces of American folk
art -- the painted flag farm gate from the Darling farm in Jefferson County,
N.Y. It is believed to have been painted in 1876 and is in the collection of
the Museum of American Folk Art in New York.;    The chest was introduced in
1982 as the hallmark of Lane's America Collection of furniture, designed in
cooperation with the folk art museum. It was discontinued in 1989, but "we
brought it back in January of this year with the new resurgence in patriotic
themes," says Carolyn Davis of the Lane advertising department. The chest's
retail price is $700, but the Horchow Home Collection catalog has it on sale
for $450.;    While most catalog firms, including Horchow and Lillian Vernon,
view flag-motif items as seasonal, some retailers expect the flag to continue
flying high in home furnishings for some time. They also expect this patriotic
wave to extend into increased popularity for American-made goods.  </TEXT>

JULY FOURTH OBSERVED WITH FROLIC, THOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: BARBECUES AND THE BEACH DRAW CROWDS. BUT SOME FIND TIME TO PONDER THE 
MEANING OF INDEPENDENCE.

<P>
The words of civic responsibility rang out clearly from the loudspeakers at the 
35th annual Independence Day celebration at Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt that freedom requires responsibility," a high school 
junior wrote in an award-winning essay that was read at the event. "Freedom 
without responsibility is the definition of the word anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
But only moments before, anarchy seemed to rule the day as eager children tried 
to eat their way to a messy victory in a pie-eating contest as parents watched 
and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of patriotism and pleasure prevailed throughout Los Angeles 
County on Wednesday as residents poured out of their homes into bright 
sunshine, lining streets for parades and gathering around barbecue grills with 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day for reunions, memories, egg tosses and three-legged races. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, for fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 people decided to get a jump on both their neighbors and the sun 
at the fourth annual pre-dawn fireworks display north of Santa Monica Pier. 
They arrived in droves -- some even spent the night -- congesting streets and 
packing the pier, the beach and cliffs overlooking the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks exploded and sent waves of color shimmering in the sky to the 
accompaniment of the Los Angeles Pops Orchestra. The crowd oohed and aahed and 
occasionally burst into applause. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great audio-visual experience," said Eric Hammerlund, a 19-year-old 
architecture student at Woodbury University. "It was really good to hear 
everybody applaud with you." 
</P>
<P>
Others went beyond the purely audio-visual and turned the experience into a 
gastronomic one. Moo Lim, 40, with his wife and young son, came armed with a 
camping stove and a cache of coffee, noodles, chicken, beef and shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica event offered a respite from the sweltering heat in Rosemead, 
Lim said. "It's fun. Last year we came with six families in our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The turnout for the fireworks display, aptly named "Dawn's Early Light," was 
the largest since the event was moved to early morning from evening three years 
ago in an attempt to reduce both traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
But violence marred the festivities when two men were shot in unrelated 
incidents, according to police, who said the wounds were not life threatening. 
Fights also broke out along the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those attending were unaware of the violence and simply enjoyed 
themselves, including a woman from Virginia who braved the possibility of 
giving birth to her sixth child at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me, 'You can go but stay close to a hospital,' " the woman 
said, patting her stomach. "I like excitement." 
</P>
<P>
For those who thought the rockets' red glare came too early at Santa Monica, 
Venice Beach offered another kind of glistening display at a more civilized 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of muscular, tanned, oiled bodies, for which the beach is famous, struck 
poses before an admiring crowd. The owners of the bodies were competing in the 
annual Muscle Beach Open sponsored by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Hoots, whistles and screams filled the sea-salted air as the audience expressed 
its approval for the young men in Speedos who flexed their biceps and the 
bikini-clad women who also flexed and blew kisses to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
However, one man who dared only to identify himself as "Jim" sounded a note of 
mild dissent. "I like females in good shape, but not muscular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck," he added, gazing at one particularly well-toned female physique, "she's 
bigger than I am. If push came to shove, she'd beat me up." 
</P>
<P>
The holiday was not without its serious side, especially for those with ties to 
homelands not so free. It was also a day for some to express their displeasure 
with the way things are in this country. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people in southeast Los Angeles protested police barricades and 
INS detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
The rally at Ross Snyder Park was dubbed "Committee for an Appropriate 
Celebration of July Fourth" and culminated in the burning of an American flag. 
Two people were arrested for battery on an officer and interfering with an 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of Lithuanian, Estonian, Polish and Vietnamese groups, among 
others, joined with Chinese residents in a "Let Freedom Ring Rally" outside the 
Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles. A Styrofoam and plastic replica of the 
"Goddess of Democracy," the American-inspired symbol of freedom for the Chinese 
students who protested in Beijing a year ago, stood among the rally's 40 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowd from a makeshift podium, Texas native Glory 
Rocha-Provencia said, "In Texas we have a saying: 'Remember the Alamo.' Now we 
have another saying: 'Remember Tian An Mien Square.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ting-po Huang, a Chinese immigrant, agreed with Rocha-Provencia, adding, "many 
of us immigrants are more appreciative of what this country is all about: 
liberty and a democratic form of government." 
</P>
<P>
His patriotism found an echo across town from Joseph Shabera, 54, a Marin 
County man who met in Los Angeles with nearly 20 friends from his childhood in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
As he geared up for a game of old-fashioned stickball, which he and the others 
played as children, Shabera said, "Most of us are first-generation (Americans), 
and we don't take the country for granted." For him the stickball game 
represented "tradition, remembrance and an appreciation of the things that this 
country affords us."

<TEXT>
   In an attempt to prove that anything can become a
pop hit, two Englishmen have released a dance version of Baa Baa
Black Sheep sung _ or rather bleated _ by Betsy the sheep.
   Five hundred copies of the single by Mark Richards and Ian
Fletcher have been on sale since Monday for about $2 in central
England record stores.
   Aileen Cameron, the secretary at Image Television where Richards
and Fletcher work, described the office as chaotic with requests
for records, photos of Betsy and interviews.
   Richards, who works as a scriptwriter when not acting as Betsy's
manager, said three radio stations have added the song to their
playlists. He said he and Fletcher would also welcome bids to
produce a music video.
   The sounds of the new Baa Baa Black Sheep song filled the Oasis
record store in Derby, 135 miles north of London, which has been
playing it regularly. Sales clerk Tricia Nicholls said Wednesday a
few party disc jockeys had expressed interest but so far, only one
of six copies has been sold.
   The producers said they were surprised by the amount of interest
in their song, which started out as a joke to poke fun at the music
industry's increasing use of electronic mixing.
   ``The Betsy Boogie starts out on hands and knees and then you
chew some grass like a sheep would do,'' Richards explained in an
interview.
   Fletcher told Sky Television: ``It's got certain influences of
some of the songs that are on the charts at the moment. I think we
wanted to prove just how little effort needs to go into making
something to get it into the charts nowadays.''
   Betsy's next hit, Richards said, will be a re-mix of the Beach
Boys' song, Baa Baa Barbara Ann.

   Like many people who have ``a certain age,''
Maggie Grubb Lambeth gets a little offended when asked how old she
is.
   ``I'm not that old,'' said Mrs. Lambeth, who along with her
identical twin sister turned 105 on Friday.
   Mrs. Lambeth's sister, Allie Grubb Hill, doesn't mind talking
about her age, but then she's a few minutes younger.
   The sisters, who are listed as the world's oldest living
identical twins by the Guinness Book of World Records, celebrated at
their home in the Mountain Vista Health Park. The two women lived in
Davidson County all their lives, never more than two miles apart,
and moved to the rest home two years ago.
   ``It's the Lord that has kept us here this long,'' Mrs. Hill said.
   Between them, Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Lambeth had 20 children, 15 of
whom are living. They have 48 grandchildren, 90 great-grandchildren
and 31 great-great-grandchildren.
   Hazel Briles, 67, the second-youngest of Mrs. Lambeth's nine
children, said her mother kept her house spotless and her yard raked
until she was in her 90s.
   ``She just enjoyed doing things like that,'' Mrs. Briles said.
``She was a real active person. Most everybody in our family is real
active.''
   The two sisters rely on each other for companionship, and somehow
manage to keep each other going, Mrs. Briles said.
   ``They just don't make them like that anymore,'' she said.

   Fifteen gifts that blew off the roof of a van
on Interstate 80 on Christmas Eve have been returned to a couple by
a state roads worker who tracked them down through a department
store label.
   Michael and Julianne Wiegel of Lafayette, Colo., lost the
Christmas presents as they drove through Nebraska but did not
discover the gifts were missing until they arrived at the home of
relatives in Wisconsin.
   ``I was in tears,'' Mrs. Wiegel said. ``At that point, I figured
a Nebraska wheat farmer probably would find them in his field next
spring.''
   David Luusua, a maintenance worker for the Nebraska Roads
Department, found the packages that same day, strewn along the
shoulder of Interstate 80 about a mile west of the Platte River
bridge, between Omaha and Lincoln.
   Jerry Johnson, maintenance office supervisor, said the workers
called the State Patrol, but no one claimed the gifts over the next
week or so. Johnson then began some detective work.
   ``Some of the packages had skidded on the pavement and I noticed
the wrapping on one had torn,'' Johnson said. ``I saw a label on one
of the boxes from a department catalog store and it was addressed to
a lady in Lafayette, Colo.''
   Johnson said he called the woman and told her what he had found
and she identified them.
   ``I was really surprised,'' Mrs. Wiegel said.

   Tourists could thank their lucky stars for
Friday the 13th at the Betsy Ross House.
   Nearly 600 people received 13-star flags Friday at the home of
the woman who many believe designed the first American flag,
according to William Kingsley, executive director of the house a few
blocks from the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.
   ``It's fantastic,'' Kingsley said. ``We probably have five times
as many visitors as we did on a comparable day a year ago. The
weather is good and that helps.''
   Visitors received 12-inch-by-18-inch flags, which the house also
hands out each Flag Day.
   They included a tour bus from a New York high school for Hispanic
and Far Eastern immigrants, who received an extra flag for their
principal. Kingsley said the group's teacher had told the students
in Spanish to thank Kingsley in English.
   ``It was touching,'' he said.

FORBES FETE: BIRTHDAY FIT FOR A SULTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The invitations, printed on Forbes stationery, began: "Our father is not in 
heaven yet, and as he also still signs our paychecks we are anxious to make his 
seventieth birthday a memorable one . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the five children of Malcolm Stevenson Forbes have made sure that when 
their father, the chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, turns the 
big seven-O on Saturday he won't feel too ancient. 
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, limousines began pulling up to Hangar 14 at the John F. 
Kennedy International Airport in New York, where some 600 friends and business 
associates, including California Gov. George Deukmejian and his wife Gloria, 
boarded three chartered planes. Destination: Tangier, Morocco, for a 
48-hour-long birthday celebration fit for a sultan. The weekend will be capped 
with a black-tie bash at Forbes' private Tangier palace, Palais Mendoub, on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Titans of big business and even the most jaded social types are ga-ga. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconceivable," said Barry Kaye, president of Barry Kaye Associates, a 
life insurance agency in Century City, who is a guest along with his wife, 
Carole. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Malcolm's style," allowed advice columnist Abigail Van Buren, who is 
attending with her husband Mort Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the guest list alone reads something like, well, the Forbes 400. 
Included are the chairmen and chief executive officers of dozens of major 
corporations, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chrysler Corporation, 
Compaq Computer Corp. and Computerland Corp. -- and those are just some of the 
Cs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous Faces 
</P>
<P>
There are famous faces, including Elizabeth Taylor (Forbes' date), Henry 
Kissinger, Walter Cronkite, William F. Buckley, Barbara Walters and her husband 
Merv Adelson. There are headline makers, such as Wall Street star Henry Kravis 
and his wife, designer Carolyne Roehm. There are media tycoons, such as John 
Kluge, Rupert Murdoch, Katherine Graham and Mort Zuckerman. There are fashion 
designers Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Arnold Scaasi. There are the 
governors of New Jersey and Rhode Island. Even Robin Leach, the host of 
television's "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," made the list. 
</P>
<P>
The small Southern California contingent includes Betsy Bloomingdale, Leonard 
and Caroline Firestone, and Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive officer 
of Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Another 200 or so Moroccan guests will join the party, including King Hassan 
II, who is hosting a luncheon for the entire group Sunday before their 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list illustrates how Forbes has refined the art of mixing business 
with pleasure. Barry Kaye says that once he began advertising in the magazine 
last October, "all of a sudden we were invited for a couple lunches and a ride 
on the yacht. This is the way he develops his business. He's written about it. 
He just develops a wonderful relationship with you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian on List 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Gov. Deukmejian made the list not for his advertising budget but 
because he appeared on the magazine's cover February 27, 1984, and subsequently 
met twice with the Forbes editorial staff. 
</P>
<P>
Has he ever previously attended a Forbes party? "Not to my knowledge," says a 
spokesman in Sacramento. "This would be the first one." 
</P>
<P>
For early calendar entry, invitations were first mailed out in March and signed 
by Forbes' children Malcolm Jr. (Steve), Robert (Bob), Christopher (Kip), 
Timothy (Tim) and Moira Forbes Mumma. Since then "Ali-Dada" (as his children 
call Forbes in the invitation) updates began arriving, including the latest, 
sent by Federal Express to the California contingent at least, which arrived 
Monday and included a map to Hangar 14 at JFK and an airport pass. 
</P>
<P>
A few feathers flew when it was learned that three planes would be flying: a 
DC8, a 747 and Concorde. Those not earmarked for the faster-flying Concorde 
feared that a caste system was in operation. But Don Garson, director of 
corporate communications at Forbes, says that the decision was purely 
democratic. "Anybody who came a distance to get to New York will be on the 
Concorde," he said. Van Buren (and presumably the rest of the West Coast 
contingent) is assigned to Concorde. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tangier Itinerary 
</P>
<P>
The itinerary in Tangier begins with dinner upon arrival tonight at the Solazur 
Hotel, and the opportunity to shop or sightsee Saturday. The birthday bash 
unfolds Saturday night at Forbes' dazzling Palais Mendoub with dinner, dancing 
and fireworks. Dress code: Black tie, ball gowns, turbans and tiaras are all in 
order. "Scheherazade," as the invitation pointed out, "took 1,001 nights to 
keep her old man happy -- we're counting on one night in a thousand in a 
Moroccan palace to keep The Chairman smiling." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes purchased Palais Mendoub to serve as headquarters for the magazine in 
1970, around the time of the international oil crisis, so that he could publish 
an Arabic Forbes, beginning in 1972. The Arabic edition disbanded five or six 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
In his new book, "More Than I Dreamed," to be published in October by Simon 
&amp; Schuster, Forbes describes his first reaction to seeing the palace 
perched on a cliff. "The physical setting was breathtaking. To your right you 
can see Gibraltar. Straight ahead is Algeciras, the southernmost tip of Europe, 
only 20 minutes away. And to your left, the site of the battle of Trafalgar, 
and at the same time you can see every ship that enters or leaves the 
Mediterranean." No one will say how much the party is costing, or who is 
footing the bill, or for that matter, whether the whole thing will be written 
off on Forbes' taxes. A previously published estimate of a $2-million cost for 
the party was neither confirmed nor denied by Forbes' press office. "We don't 
know where that number comes from," said a spokesperson. "We never release 
numbers."

MEN SHOULD START TALKING ABOUT CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELISE T. CHISOLM, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My good friend Betsy -- not her real name -- found out she had breast cancer 
six months ago and has told a few of us all about it. She is coping well after 
treatment, and her disease is in remission. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Alex -- not his real name -- has prostate cancer and isn't talking 
about it. He has never told anyone but his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason I know he has it is that his wife told me; she needed someone 
with whom she could talk. She was horrified at first. "Why him?" she asked. 
After the tears, the worry set in. His problem was also diagnosed six months 
ago, and his cancer, like Betsy's, is in remission after radiation treatment. 
But Alex is losing his ability to perform sexually, and he and his wife are 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
Both Betsy and Alex have a good chance of living long and happy lives. Betsy's 
mental attitude is great. She is buoyant and hopeful. But Alex is quiet and 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some of my best friends have had breast cancer. Most of them have beaten the 
disease. And apparently, some of my best male friends have had prostate cancer 
and I just never knew it. I feel sorry about that. I would have liked to have 
sent cards, offered prayers and hope for them and their families. As most of us 
have learned, cancer affects the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
142,900 New Cases 
</P>
<P>
One out of 10 women in the United States will get breast cancer. The American 
Cancer Society estimates that there will be 142,900 new cases this year. And an 
estimated 103,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United 
States in 1989. About one out of 11 men will develop the disease. 
</P>
<P>
I am so proud of women. Where once they could not talk about that area of their 
body, now they can. We talk about mammograms and breast examinations as 
routinely as if they were just dental checks. That is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
From Julia Child and Betty Ford to Shirley Temple Black, women who have 
survived breast cancer have told their stories of pain and gain, and the road 
to wellness. 
</P>
<P>
If you did not see NBC's "The Ann Jillian Story" or "Destined to Live," you 
missed wonderful stories. "Destined to Live" was hosted by Jill Eikenberry from 
"L.A. Law," herself a breast cancer patient, and this docudrama wasn't medical, 
it was more philosophical and personal. 
</P>
<P>
Jill talked to many famous women -- Nancy Reagan, Gloria Steinem -- housewives 
and career women about their bouts with cancer, and then the film cut to her 
elderly aunt who had cancer years ago, and how her faith had held her together 
and she had overcome. 
</P>
<P>
I was so impressed with the courage and positive attitude of these women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not So Grim 
</P>
<P>
The statistics on breast cancer are not as grim as they once were. Localized 
breast cancer is nearly 100% curable today, and the same is true of prostate 
cancer in men. 
</P>
<P>
But now I want to tell you why I think it is important to be like Betsy with 
her cancer rather than like Alex. 
</P>
<P>
First, Alex's wife thinks he would be much better off if he talked about his 
illness -- the treatment and the prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that men have been conditioned to keep things about their sexuality 
to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some people don't even know where the prostate gland is. Although men can and 
do brag about sexual prowess, they do not want to talk about impotence, much 
less admit it. The old saw that "men don't cry and women are the weaker sex" 
still flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer is, also, not always the end of a man's ability to perform 
sexually, but many men are macho about being ill, almost cloistered -- and 
especially so if it represents an affront to their manhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proven Wrong 
</P>
<P>
Women who are afraid they will lose their sexuality because of breast cancer 
and mastectomy have been proved wrong and have found out that breasts are not 
the only things that make them attractive or desirable. 
</P>
<P>
I guess what I am saying is that men go by a double standard. They might talk 
about their wives' recuperation from breast surgery at a party, but you don't 
hear them talk in a group about their "prostate trouble" or prostate cancer in 
a serious way. There is still that bravado. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing Alex, I think it would be much better if he knew that we all know he is 
ill and suffering from fear and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
People who can talk about their illnesses are much better off psychologically. 
Denial is normal at first, but you can't go forward with it. Support from loved 
ones is essential. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Alex suffers alone, and I hate that. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I'm being a little hard on men, but even Dr. John Laszlo, author of 
"Understanding Cancer," admits there is an unneeded "shamefacedness to prostate 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Have to Kill 
</P>
<P>
I recommend this excellent book for its candor and its information on the 
emotional side of dealing with cancer. Cancer kills 460,000 Americans annually, 
but it doesn't have to, and now we know that. Four out of 10 patients who get 
cancer this year will be alive five years after diagnosis.

   Albert Engelken and Robert Thomson had never met, though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world. 
Mr. Engelken, now a transit-association executive in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Thomson, a paper-products salesman in Montvale, N.J., hadn't even talked to each other. 
But one recent day, they became much closer. 

   Mr. Engelken, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of "my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players." 
He often groans, he says, at the "clutter" of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament "about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game." 
His morning paper, the Washington Post, even carries a sports column called "Jurisprudence" that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers. 
Like many sports buffs, Mr. Engelken has turned cynic. 

   But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes, and about what Babe Ruth, Mr. Engelken reminds us, once called "the only real game in the world." 
To Mr. Engelken, it is also a story "about love, because I'm blessed to have a wife who still thinks her slightly eccentric husband's 50th birthday deserves the ultimate present." 

   To understand what Mr. Engelken means, one must go back to a sunny October afternoon in 1951 at New York's Polo Grounds stadium, where, it can be argued, the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out. 

   It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants (the predecessor to the San Francisco Giants scheduled to play in tonight's world series). 
Baseball fans throughout New York had sweated out a long summer with their teams, and now it had come to this: a battle between the two for the National League pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game, no less. 

   Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands, and shouted at the top of their lungs. 
Mr. Engelken was doing the same across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where, with his nose pressed against the front window of the Passaic-Clifton National Bank, he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event. 

   The playoff series had riveted the 12-year-old Giants fan. 
"The Giants struck first, winning the opener, 3-1, on a two-run homer off Dodger right-hander Ralph Branca," Mr. Engelken recalls with precision today. 
"The Giants got swamped in the second game, 100, and trailed 4-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game. 
The Giants scored once and had runners on second {Whitey Lockman} and third {Clint Hartung} as Bobby Thomson advanced to the plate." 

   The rest, as they say, is history. 
Mr. Thomson, a tall, Scottish-born, right-hand hitter, stepped into the batter's box. 
"Thomson took a called strike," Mr. Engelken recounts. 
The tension mounted as Ralph Branca, again on the mound, stared down the batter. 
He wound up and let loose a fastball. 
The pitch sailed toward Bobby Thomson high and inside and then, with a crack of the bat, was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands. 
"Giants fans went into euphoria," says Mr. Engelken. 

   And Bobby Thomson was made a legend. 
The same Bobby Thomson, it turns out, who sells those paper-goods today. 

   There can't be an older baseball fan alive who doesn't clearly remember that Bobby Thomson homer, who can't tell you where he was when he heard the famous Russ Hodges radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with Mr. Hodges shouting, over and over, "The Giants win the pennant, the Giants win the pennant]" 

   Mr. Engelken and Mr. Thomson drifted in different directions in the subsequent years, and the Polo Grounds, located under Coogan's Bluff in upper Manhattan, was replaced by a public-housing project. 
Mr. Thomson played outfield and third base until 1960, posting a lifetime .270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales. 

   Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington, but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951. 
When his wife, Betsy, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966, Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: "You look prettier than Bobby Thomson's home run." 
The couple's first dog, Homer, was named after the Great Event, though unwitting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet. 

   And when Mr. Engelken's sister, Martha, who was born two days before the home run, reached her 25th birthday, Mr. Engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events. 
Mr. Thomson sent off a card to Martha: "It doesn't seem like 25 years since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth," it read. 
Martha was pleased, but nowhere near as much as Mr. Engelken. 

   The family license plate reads "ENG 23," the first three letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- Bobby Thomson's uniform number. 
And on Mr. Engelken's 40th birthday, his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. Thomson to be autographed. 
"What could have been better?" asks Mr. Engelken. 

   Betsy Engelken asked the same question earlier this year, when her husband was about to turn 50. 
She had an idea. 

   On her husband's 50th birthday (after an auspicious 23 years of marriage, it should be noted), Betsy, Al and their college-bound son set out for New York to visit Fordham University. 
Mrs. Engelken had scheduled a stop on the New Jersey Turnpike to, she told her husband, pick up some papers for a neighbor. 
The papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10. 

   "It sounded like something out of Ian Fleming," Mr. Engelken recalls. 

   At the appointed exit, the family pulled over, and Mrs. Engelken went to get her papers. 
Mr. Engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window. 

   In a matter of minutes, she was back, with a tall, silver-haired man in tow. 
She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname: "Bertie," she said, "Happy 50th Birthday. 
This is Bobby Thomson." 

   "And there he was," recalls Mr. Engelken. 
"The hero of my youth, the one person in history I'd most like to meet. 
Keep your Thomas Jeffersons, or St. Augustines or Michelangelos; I'd take baseball's Flying Scot without hesitation." 

   They talked of the home run. 
"I thought it was in the upper deck," said Bobby Thomson, now 66 years old. 
They talked of the aftermath. 
"I never thought it would become so momentous," Bobby remarked. 
Mr. Engelken, says his wife, "was overwhelmed by the whole thing. 
It was worth it, just for the look on Albert's face." 

   The two men spent an hour at Exit 10, rehashing the event, "fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned 50," Mr. Engelken says. 
His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca "a very fine pitcher." 
And when Mr. Engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he didn't even know, Bobby Thomson replied: "You know, Albert, if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy, you have an obligation to do it." 

   In an interview, Mr. Thomson, who is married and has three grown children, says he has few ties to baseball these days, other than playing old-timers games now and again. 
But his fans, to his constant amazement, never let him forget the famous four-bagger. 
His mail regularly recalls "my one event," and has been growing in recent years. 

   In response to the letters, Mr. Thomson usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note, and rarely arranges a rendezvous. 
But when Betsy Engelken wrote him, saying she could stop near his New Jersey home, it seemed different. 
"What a good feeling it would be for me to do that," he says he thought. 

   When the Engelken family got back from its trip up north, Mr. Engelken wrote it all down, just to make sure no detail was missed. 
"On the way home," his notes recall, "it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south. 
My mind was miles north at a place called Coogan's Bluff, where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it. 

   "Take heart, sports fans," he wrote. 
"Real heroes exist. 
You might not find one in the `Jurisprudence' column. 
But who knows? 
You might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10 of the New Jersey Turnpike."

   Democrats and Republicans have yet to
nominate their parties' standard-bearers this November, but 15
modern-day Betsy Rosses are embroidering the flags that will
accompany the new president who will take office next January.
   In the basement of Building 13 of the Defense Department's
supply center, below the gymnasium-sized rooms where huge spools of
olive drab thread turn into acres of U.S. Army fatigues, the women
of the embroidering room serve the next president with needles in
hand and thimbles on fingers.
   Beyond the whine of sewing machines, behind the cinder block
walls, the basement of Building 13 is the only place in the country
where the president's flags are made.
   Tiny spots of chalk dust outline the eagle and stars that make
up the president's coat of arms, as the women gently poke 19 colors
of silk and synthetic threads through the navy blue rayon banner,
held taut across a wooden rack.
   For the women in the embroidery room, who spend most of their
time embroidering detail on military units' flags, the opportunity
to work on a flag for the president holds a special thrill.
   ``When he talks on television, I look at the seal,'' said Maria
T. Negron, who learned embroidery as a hobby while growing up in
Puerto Rico.
   The women embroider hundreds of flags each year for various
military units, Cabinet members and Congress, but the presidential
flag is most important, the workers said.
   ``We make sure all the employees get a chance to work on a
presidential flag. It's one of the best morale builders,'' said
Frank Bennett, production chief at the center's manufacturing
directorate.
   One worker can embroider both sides of a 4-foot, 4-inch by
5-foot, 6-inch presidential flag in nine weeks, Bennett said.
However, if a deadline is looming, two or more women will embroider
the same flag, he said.
   Two or three flags are made for the president in most years, but
with a new president taking office, seven new flags are being
created.
   ``This flag symbolizes the most powerful office in the world.
And wherever he goes, the flag goes with him,'' Bennett said.
   At least five are always in use: one at the Oval Office, one
aboard Air Force One, one at the White House portico for outdoor
speeches and receptions for heads of state, one with the
president's honor guard, and one as backup, said Col. Victor M.
Hernandez, chief of the manufacturing directorate at the supply
center.
   Laden with symbolism, the coat of arms features an American
eagle clasping an olive branch in one talon and a bundle of 13
arrows in the other. A constellation of 13 stars runs through a
series of rays coming from the eagle's shoulders. The rays shoot
through an arc of thirteen cloud puffs.
   The coat of arms also appears on the president's seal, which is
most often seen attached to the front of a lectern.
   The embroidery room is staffed by middle-aged women who
recognize that few members of the younger generation are interested
in hand embroidery.
   ``Both sides have to be the same. No machine can ever do that,''
said Connnie Martins, who brought her skill to Philadelphia from
Portugal about 18 years ago. ``My daughter, she doesn't like it.''
   Each stitch is matched on each side of the flag, so the eagle
looking to his right on one side is looking to its left on the
other. The only part that doesn't appear backward on the flag's
opposite side are the words ``E Pluribus Unum,'' Latin for ``out of
many, one.''
   When the embroidery is finished, a synthetic gold-tone fringe is
stitched to three sides of the flag.

<LEADPARA>  IN A classic "Ugly Duckling" scenario, a San Jose Victorian has gone from
being "the worst house on the block" to being the sole West Coast winner of a
National Trust for Historic Preservation award.;    "We were excited and
pleased they picked a house that two ordinary homeowners had done," says Betsy
Mathieson of the Great American Home Award she and her husband, Scott, won for
their 10-year residential restoration project. "This is our first house, our
first renovation, our first woodworking, our first wiring -- it's our first
everything."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bruce Judd, an architect with Architectural Resources Group in San
Francisco and one of the judges of the competition, recalls being "impressed"
by the Mathiesons' efforts.;    "It's not a grand house or a major piece of
architecture, but it's a nice, smaller, more typical kind of house. These
people had lovingly researched what was there and tried to put it back. They
had a long-range plan and executed it very well," says Judd, who has served on
the six-panel judging committee since the award program started two years
ago.;    "We saw a lot of projects where developers went in and in two years
spent a lot of money, but you could tell there wasn't the love and affection
in the process that the Mathiesons had," he adds.;    Scott and Betsy
Mathieson, both engineering geologists, purchased their single story,
1,170-square-foot Queen Anne cottage in 1979 for $53,500.;    "We wanted a
Victorian and after looking in San Francisco, Alameda, West Oakland and San
Jose, we could afford San Jose," says 36-year-old Scott.;    "We wanted a
neighborhood that was mostly Victorians that we believed would improve rather
than deteriorate. We couldn't afford a fixed-up house, but we needed one in
good enough shape to live in while we restored it," says 35-year-old Betsy.;  
 The house the Mathiesons chose is on Pierce Avenue -- a block-long street
bounded by Almaden Avenue and Market Street, just three blocks from the San
Jose Convention Center.;    While some homeowners might shudder at the notion
of a convention center going up in their neighborhood, the Mathiesons are
philosophical about it.;    "The convention center helped us because we
organized the neighborhood to keep from getting run over," says Scott of the
Market/Almaden Neighborhood Association. The group lobbied for new trees and
old-fashioned streetlights in the area and has been successful in keeping a
condominium project on Pierce Avenue compatible with neighborhood
architecture.;    The Mathiesons' restoration project is a familiar one to
lovers of old houses.;    Among the joys was the discovery of Maude Lawler's
childish signature on a section of living room plaster. Research revealed
"Mrs. Annie C. Lawler, a dressmaker" lived in the house in 1892. The
Mathiesons preserved the signature and show it to visitors.;     Seeking the
right doorknobs;    Preservation was a key objective of the Mathiesons, who
opted for restoration over replacement whenever possible. Still searching for
the exact pattern doorknobs that match the few original ones in their home,
Betsy recognized one on another Victorian home while doing some political
canvassing. She's asked the owner if he would be willing to trade it for a
different pattern from the same era.;    On the down side, "the house had
lowered ceilings, sleeping lofts had been put in some rooms, the bathroom had
been modernized and had a leaking shower stall and the roof had been leaking
for years, creating soft spots in the ceilings," Scott says. Floors were as
much as six inches out of level and wood paneling had been used to camouflage
crooked portions of walls.;    The roof was a first priority, taking the
Mathiesons a week to pull off seemingly endless layers of redwood shingles and
roofing materials. After three more weeks' work they had a new roof of cedar
shingles, and Betsy used a saber saw to reproduce the original fish scale
shingles over the front bay window.;    Plaster was repaired, only to later be
damaged when the house had to be raised to replace the mud sill foundation
with a new reinforced concrete foundation and full basement.;     4 weeks 'in
the air';    Scrapbooks filled with photos are reminders of the nine months
the Mathiesons lived with a basement kitchen, using only a microwave and a
toaster oven for cooking; the four weeks they spent "up in the air" while the
house was raised to build the new foundation; and the three summers Betsy
spent stripping exterior paint with a heat gun.;    "We did everything in the
wrong order," Betsy says. "Now we know how to do it right -- now we'd do the
roof and foundation and then rip out the plaster and put in the new wiring and
plumbing.";    In spite of discouraging setbacks, the Mathiesons persevered.
"We worked on weekends, but not always. We went extremely slowly, but we
learned the right way," Betsy says.;    The exterior of the home was painted
olive brown with gold, cream and dark red trim in 1988. From January 1985
until August 1989 they lived with the interior sheetrocked walls painted a
flat white. It was the 100th anniversary of the sewer permit issued for their
home Dec. 10, 1889, combined with a Victorian Preservation Association house
tour, that caused the Mathiesons to finally push the project.;    "The last
three months of 1989 we worked full time, 20 hours a day," Scott says.;   
"The house tour was an impetus to finish," Betsy says.;    In that brief time
an expert wood grainer, Zane Working of Oakland, matched original walnut and
oak graining on doors, wainscoting, trim and windows. He also touched up the
faux tortoise shell finish on the cast-iron fireplace front in the dining
room.;    All seven rooms of the house are finished with hand-printed
Victorian-style wallpapers from Bradbury &amp; Bradbury Wallpapers in Benicia. The
ceiling of the dining room alone has 150 individually cut pieces of paper
forming the elaborate patterns.;    The Mathieson home is furnished with
family heirloom furniture and paintings as well as antique pieces they've
found in travels throughout Northern California. One particularly impressive
piece is an Eastlake Murphy Bed marked with a Feb. 3, 1883, date and a San
Francisco address.;    The Mathiesons are proud that by salvaging and careful
shopping they were able to remodel the kitchen for about $1,000, including
replacing cabinets and installing a vintage Wedgwood stove.;    Ten days
before the Oct. 28, 1989, house tour the Loma Prieta earthquake hit. "The
brick chimneys next door fell, but we had no damage," Scott says, adding that
he had re-plumbed the bathroom just five days earlier.;    Many couples
consider one renovation to be enough, and in some cases even one too many. Not
the Mathiesons, who both claim they would do it again.;    "Eventually we'd
like to own a bigger house, a Queen Anne with a two-story tower," Betsy says.
In the meantime, they are awaiting the birth of their first child this summer.  </TEXT>

RINGWALD HOPING TO GET CAREER BACK ON TRACK

<P>
Molly Ringwald, 22, finds herself in a supporting role for the first time in 
years in "Betsy's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
It's an important distinction at this point in her career because she is a Star 
with a capital S. 
</P>
<P>
But her recent films suggest she has been the victim of poor advice and 
victimized by less than inspired choices of scripts, directors and co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, she had been one of Hollywood's hottest young acting talents, 
brilliant in a trio of John Hughes films, "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink" 
and "The Breakfast Club," stunning in her revelations of the minds and hearts 
of adolescent females. 
</P>
<P>
The pert and poignant redhead, who has lost her innocence on screen more often 
than any star since Mary Pickford, marches to the altar in her current movie, 
"Betsy's Wedding," a fact that brings a smile to her freckled face. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Ringwald has managed to escape the coming-of-age or rite-of-passage 
film in which a post-pubescent girl enters adulthood with all the ramifications 
such transitions imply, at least in movies. 
</P>
<P>
An accomplished actress who looks and photographs a half-dozen years younger 
than she is -- which makes a big difference when a woman is 22 -- Ringwald 
chose to abandon her familiar metier. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? She's an adult, even though she still looks like a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald made her first movie at 13 in "Tempest," a comedy based on 
Shakespeare's play. She was astonishingly good, winning a Golden Globe Award 
for best new actress. 
</P>
<P>
She had an equal impact in the TV movie "Surviving," dealing with teen-age 
suicide. And her reviews in the Hughes films were glowing. 
</P>
<P>
But Ringwald felt it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Her recent films, however, have been less than successful at the box-office. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pick-up Artist" with Robert Downey Jr. was a disappointment, both to its 
producers and the young actress. "For Keeps," in which she played a pregnant 
teen-ager, failed to thrill anyone. "Fresh Horses," co-starring Andrew 
McCarthy, was a rehash of "Pretty in Pink" and never got out of the barn. 
</P>
<P>
She flew to France to co-star with Robert Lindsay and John Gielgud in the 
British film "Strike it Rich," which didn't. 
</P>
<P>
She tried new directions, playing Cordelia in Jean-Luc Godard's stage 
presentation of "King Lear" and in the New York stage production of Horton 
Foote's "Lily Dale." 
</P>
<P>
In "Betsy's Wedding," Ringwald is back on familiar terrain, playing a girl 
whose wedding touches off a series of family crises. She plays an off-beat 
bride in the comedy directed by Alan Alda, who also portrays her father. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald plays the title role, but she is not the star. Alda is. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I've come full circle," Ringwald said in an interview. "I did this 
picture because I wanted to work with Alan Alda. I liked the script. It made me 
laugh. I liked the prospect of doing an ensemble film again. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself my family would never be like this, getting upset over 
such silly things. I wouldn't let my family control me like the parents do in 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my sister Elizabeth decided on a formal wedding and in essence we're 
doing this movie. It's amazing what problems a family gets into over a wedding. 
There's something about the tradition and the ceremony that makes people crazy. 
You argue about everything -- invitations, music, refreshments, the church, 
clothes, the reception." 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald, who began her career singing with her father's Great Pacific Jazz 
Band when she was 4, is a thoughtful young woman who has no matrimonial plans 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Her first priority is her career. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriage is a long way off for me," she said, "but you never know. I think 
I'll have a small wedding with just family and a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Times have changed from my mother's generation. They got married early, 
sometimes right out of high school. Mom married when she was 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I've changed so much in the past five years -- I'm practically a different 
person every year. It would be a huge risk for me to marry now. I won't be the 
same person in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today a lot of women my age don't want to make marriage their career. It's a 
hard balancing act to have children and an acting career. But it's possible. 
Women are doing it every day. Compromises have to be made.

$5-MILLION CAMPAIGN OPENS FOR HOMELESS;

About 50 community and business leaders attended a dinner party Wednesday to 
start a $5-million fund-raising drive for the South Orange County YWCA Hotel 
for Women, a shelter for homeless women in Santa Ana. The low-key get-together 
filled a few plush, white-carpeted central rooms in Sandy and Betsy Sanders' 
Anaheim Hills home -- the first of a series of consciousness- and money-raising 
events dubbed "Great Homes for the Homeless." 
</P>
<P>
"That name is a little embarrassing, isn't it?" Betsy Sanders said. "I don't 
take it to mean 'look at my great home,' but in the sense of reminding us all 
of how much we have. If we have a home, a job, the self-confidence it takes to 
maintain a job -- if we have all of that, we're very lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"Every home is a great home," the hostess said. 
</P>
<P>
(And her great home -- an "estate," according to a realtor's full-color flyer 
untucked from Sandy's roll-top desk -- is for sale.) 
</P>
<P>
Guests parked on the street and rode a limo up the short, albeit steep, 
driveway.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Issue 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel for Women is a 38-bed facility that houses and feeds homeless women 
for up to 60 days and provides assistance programs, including psychological 
counseling, medical and legal referrals and employment guidance and training. 
With the "Great Homes" campaign, management and supporters of the 3-year-old 
shelter hope to create an endowment fund to meet long-term financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Douglas, the South Orange County YWCA executive director, said the hotel 
runs on a $250,000 annual budget, less than $50,000 of which comes from local, 
state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to provide a model program, and to do that we need a lot of money 
(from the private sector)," Douglas said. "I get the impression that people 
think the problem of homelessness is going away. In fact, the reverse is true." 
</P>
<P>
"This community has been extremely generous," said Arlene Sontag, president of 
the YWCA board. "We burned our ($1.1-million) mortgage after just two years -- 
one of the bank vice presidents came down and lit the match -- so I think that 
says something about the generosity here. But I'm not sure operations and 
maintenance is quite as glamorous as building a building. This may be a little 
tougher to raise money for." 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Weber, a member of the campaign leadership, said organizers hope to raise 
half of the projected $5 million by the end of the year. "This year," Weber 
said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homemade 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Sanders did her own cooking -- with a little help from Jeanne Dorsey, who 
cooks for hotel residents. "We're going Southwest tonight," said Sanders, who 
was busy at the burners when she wasn't hostessing. "Let's see, we're having 
Mexican chicken Kiev, corn pudding, zucchini a la question mark and salad a la 
double question mark -- that's salad with oranges and onions and pecans and a 
raspberry vinaigrette." Peeking into the oven, Dorsey said, "I'm doing the 
Mexican Jewish chicken and the pudding. I'm calling it 
corn-with-a-sense-of-humor pudding." 
</P>
<P>
In shorts and a sweat shirt, Chris Sanders, 19, tended bar for his parents. As 
he explained to one guest: "If I'd been hired, I probably couldn't have dressed 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Cocktailing and dining on Southwest with a sense of humor were Orange County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane, chairwoman of the 
fund-raising campaign; Bob Chesney and Gay Kroll, who produced a 10-minute 
videotape about the shelter -- which played continuously in the Sanders den -- 
for use in soliciting contributions; hotel director Dianne Russell; retired 
Superior Court judge Judy Ryan; Bill and Betty Palmer; Ted and Marilyn Parker; 
Jon and Camie McClintock; Roger and Barbara Allensworth, and George and Joan 
Dashiell.

It was only fitting that Isabel Schoepflin got the winning free throws in La 
Jolla Country Day's 49-47 victory over Calvin Christian in the Division V 
girls' basketball championships Thursday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jack Wigley said no one wanted the victory more than Schoepflin, who had 
played every minute the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got tremendous timing for a sophomore," Wigley said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoepflin, who started last year as a freshman, was a first-team all-league 
selection this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres (17-5) not only defended their division championship, they also got 
revenge on the Crusaders (23-2), who had defeated them twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we won it because we wanted to win it after they beat us twice," 
Schoepflin said. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a minute to play, Betsy Wilgenburg made a steal and drove 
downcourt for a layup to put Calvin Christian ahead, 47-46. Schoepflin was 
fouled with 35 seconds left and made one of two free throws to tie the score, 
47-47. Nine seconds later, Schoepflin was fouled again and this time made both 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Christian, which led most of the game, had a chance to win but missed 
two layups in the final 10 seconds. The Crusaders led throughout the first half 
but the Torres' Julie Corbo scored at the buzzer to tie the score, 22-22, at 
halftime. Calvin Christian's Betsy Wilgenburg scored at the third-quarter 
buzzer to tie the score again, 34-34. Schoepflin, who had only two points in 
the first half, led the Torres with 13 points. Nancy Dickerson and Robin 
Chatman each added 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres' goal was to stop Calvin Christian's 5-9 guard, Wilgenburg, who led 
her team with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We went more man-to-man and tried to shut Betsy down," Wigley said. "She's 
tough to stop."

<TEXT>
   Joe Howe, who proudly waves hundreds of
American flags daily atop the Capitol, believes flag burners should
be punished _ no matter what the Supreme Court says _ and says he
hopes he never meets one.
   Howe, 32, of Hollywood, Md., is foreman of the crew that spends
eight hours every weekday on the roof of the Capitol, raising and
lowering flags for members of Congress who send them to constituents
on request.
   For prices ranging from $7.38 to $56.25 each, depending on size
and such accessories as a pole and decorative eagle, constituents
can boast that their flags actually flew over the Capitol _ even if
only for a few seconds.
   ``I take pride in my work,'' Howe said in an interview during a
coffee break from his rooftop labors. ``How many people have the job
of flying the flag over the Capitol?''
   Howe would be surprised if there weren't a patriotic surge in
requests for flags inspired by the furor over the Supreme Court's
ruling last week that flag-burning is a form of free speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment.
   ``I don't agree with that decision, and you can quote me,'' Howe
said, ``and I don't agree with people who burn flags.''
   What would be suitable punishment for a flag burner? A lengthy
stint on Howe's work crew, raising flags on the Capitol roof in the
sweltering heat and suffocating humidity of summertime Washington?
   ``That's not stiff enough,'' Howe replied. He thought a moment
and added: ``I wouldn't want to be up there with someone who's
burned a flag.''
   Howe and his nine helpers raise and lower an average of more than
350 flags each weekday. They sometimes work on weekends to meet
requests for flags to be flown on special anniversary dates that
happen to fall on a Saturday or Sunday.
   The heaviest demand occurs on such patriotic holidays as Memorial
Day and the Fourth of July, when as many as 1,200 flags have been
flown in a single day.
   Using three small flagpoles on the roof of the House side of the
Capitol, they raise a flag for a few seconds, lower it and fold it
back into its box. In bad weather, they use six ropes equipped with
flag hooks under the sheltered skirt of the Capitol dome to ``fly''
their flags.
   The practice began in 1937, when a dozen flags were flown over
the Capitol for legislators' constituents. Last year, the number had
risen to more than 114,000. Altogether, more than 1.4 million flags
have been flown over the Capitol to meet public requests in the past
half-century.
   Down in the ``flag room'' in the Capitol basement, the busy
staging area for the flag flying operation, boxed flags are stacked
to the ceilings in four cramped rooms decorated with portraits of
Betsy Ross and a plaque bearing a poem titled ``Our Flag.''
   Chris Benza, who has run the flag room for 28 years, said the
public demand for the Stars and Stripes is growing so fast that
she's been promised a fifth storage room to handle the crush.
   ``The last few weeks we've been overwhelmed with flag requests,
and I don't know why,'' said William F. Raines, administrative
assistant to the Architect of the Capitol, who oversees the flag
program. Raines said the trend began before the Supreme Court's June
22 decision.
   Asked if the court ruling had any effect on her business, Ms.
Benza replied: ``I haven't noticed any yet, but it's possible we'll
get swamped.''

<TEXT>  What so proudly we hailed; On the Buick's antenna?; Whose broad stripes and
bright stars; Through the fog and the night,; O'er the 4 x 4's cab; Was so
gallantly streaming.; Seen at Orchard Hardware,; In a fireman's dyed hair,
Dresses, jackets and socks,; Yes, our flag's everywhere . . .;    O say does
that star-spangled banner yet wave . . . ?;    You bet it does, but I don't
think the flag-wavers are doing much honor to the flag these days.;    Does it
honor the flag when it is flown from a road-making machine, or whipped by the
wind as a car drives down the freeway at 70 mph, or -- as I saw one the other
day -- tied to the toolbox of a pick-up truck? I guess it was tied so it
wouldn't blow away, but it was being treated like a rag, not a flag.;    Union
City Fire Department decided that yellow ribbons were OK, to show support for
the troops, but flag emblems, presumably carrying a more controversial
message, had to be removed from helmets, fire engines and other departmental
property.;    So a fire captain had a red, white and blue flag shaved and dyed
into his hair.;    Well, it's the home of the free, all right. And, I guess,
the land of the brave too. But what does it prove to display a cloth, plastic,
paper or scalp-sculpted flag?;    The flag can mean any number of things these
days, from hoping our men and women in uniform come home safely to hoping they
come home safely and victoriously. It can say: USA rules. Or: Hey, this is my
country too and I don't like the way the First Ass-Kicker is running it.;   
As Burger King says: Have it your way.;    Support-the-president marchers
carry American flags. End-the-war marchers carry American flags.;    People
flying flags at their homes are reporting their flags stolen. Apparently,
thieves are pro-flag these days.;    Fundamentally, the flag symbolizes
nationhood, "the conviction that this country is superior to all other
countries because you were born in it," as George Bernard Shaw said. Or as the
Beach Boys sang: "Be true to your school. Just like you would to your girl."; 
  KGO talkhawk Jim Eason got a bunch of Mercury News readers to cancel their
subscriptions because our editors refused to dump all those boring words and
print a full-page flag, so people who were too cheap to go out and buy a flag
and too honest or cowardly to steal one could cut it out and put it in the
window. (Why doesn't Eason stop talking and devote his show to playing the
Star-Spangled Banner?);    This is dumb patriotism. I don't mean "dumb" as in
stupid, though it can be, but in the classic sense: lacking the power of
words. Words can define which national ideals the flag-waver favors: land of
the free, home of the brave, Bill of Rights, Marine Corps Hymn, etc.;    When
readers called to ask, "Why are you against the flag?" they started by saying
that printing the flag simply means "we're Americans" but then said the flag
means "we support the troops" and "we support the president" and "we hate
Saddam Hussein.";    When the newspaper reports on the war or takes an
editorial position on the war, we're supposed to say a lot more than that, and
say it a lot more clearly. And we're supposed to stand or fall on our own
credibility, without sponsorship by the stars and stripes. The newspaper may
be fishwrap but it shouldn't be flagwrapped.;    I read a story the other day
about the failure of diplomacy to prevent the war that had a line about flags
hanging limp and dispirited on Embassy Row. It was a pretty pathetic fallacy:
If it had been a windy day, the flags would have been streaming in the breeze,
war or no war.;    This is dumb in the colloquial sense. Flags don't mourn
diplomatic stalemate or cheer military victory. Flags don't think or talk.
Flags mean what people want them to mean, and if they're used too casually
they don't mean anything at all.;    The New York Times fashion section
reported Feb. 11 that flagwear is absolutely the latest thing, observing:
"Wearing depictions of the American flag was considered disrespectful. That
taboo died with the onset of the Woodstock generation. There are now flags on
T-shirts and sweatshirts, on swimsuits and beach towels, on tote bags and
umbrellas.";    Also: $500 bomber jackets, pillows, baseball caps, socks,
wallets, nightshirts, loungewear, jeans, boxer shorts and barrettes. Macy's
sells a $1,600 jeweled flag minaudiere. I don't even know what a minaudiere
is. (Actually, I looked it up, so I know now. It's a small woman's handbag
used for formal wear.);    The Woodstock generation wore flag shirts or
flag-bottomed jeans to show disrespect for the traditions of their elders.
Perhaps I spent too long in Girl Scouts, but I fail to see how it shows
patriotism or honors the flag to wear a stretch tank dress with a starry
breast and a stripey side ($60), or a cotton canvas jacket ($230) that looks
like Betsy Ross turned her surplus stock into ready-to-wear.;    Burning the
flag shows more respect. The flag-burner implicitly recognizes the flag's
symbolism as he symbolically rejects it. The guy who wears the flag on his
socks or his boxers equates it with an Izod alligator or a Lauren polo pony.
It's just the fashionable designer emblem of the season, like Scud jewelry in
Amman.;    Our flag is being used -- to make a political statement, to make a
fashion statement, to make money -- to make patriotism as simple as wearing a
T-shirt.;    I own a flag and I fly it on traditional flag-flying holidays.
These days, I show my respect for the flag by leaving it alone.  </TEXT>

In its six years, Transition House, the place that provides the homeless with 
support and tools to make the transition to mainstream society, has had a 63% 
success rate in its program graduates. Thus, the Skid Row Development 
Corporation and Charles C. Reed, president of Ahmanson Services, are asking for 
greater support Feb. 23 at the party they host at the Los Angeles Athletic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Skid Row chairman Alden McKelvey and president Martha Brown Hicks hope for 
generous donations, pointing out that Transition House is a permanent solution 
to homelessness, not astopgap. 
</P>
<P>
The cocktail affair will honor Ralphs Grocery Co. Mayor Tom Bradley and 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay are honorary co-chairmen. Sue Laris, Bruce Corwin, 
Andrea Van de Kamp, Catherine Hearst, Charles Hathaway, Jim Hill, Hugh Loftus, 
Morris Newman, Stephen Mellinger and Norman Dreyfuss are expected to be on 
hand.

DOWN-HOME: Italian opera will be followed by an "Americana Party" (Virginia 
ham, Vermont turkey, apple pie and cherry cobbler) at the black-tie opening of 
the Music Center Opera's "Tancredi" (all-American cast) at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion Feb. 17. That evening, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera's 1988-89 
season resumes with Marilyn Horne the star in her debut with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Gala and Patron subscribers including Doug Cramer, Tara Colburn, Nicholas and 
Sandra Costla, Nicholas and Janet Ciriello and Milt and Rosemary Okun are 
expected for the party in the Pavilion Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
DRIVING FORCE: For two decades customers and friends alike have dashed to San 
Juan Capistrano to see Gep (G. R.) Durenberger's new antiques shipments and 
have tea with the popular antiquarian. When he established Gep's Folie at his 
residence, a folly of a building where he brought the decorative arts leaders 
of the world together for seminars, supporters flocked to his lectures. 
</P>
<P>
Then Durenberger was asked to establish the cultural support for San Juan's 
Michael Graves-designed library; he formed the support group Libros Y Artes 
(Books and Arts). Now, he has given his incredible antiques shop to the city of 
San Juan Capistrano for the new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts he's 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
Friends from around the United States and all over California were in San Juan 
Capistrano last weekend to celebrate with Gep at a black-tie gala and to 
premiere the inaugural exhibition, "California Style: Collectors and 
Collections," which is open to the public Tuesdays through Saturdays until May 
6, when the exhibits change. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the admiring crowd at the opening was Stanley Barrows of New York, dean 
emeritus at Parsons School of Art and former chairman of Interior Design at the 
Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Gep's old pal from Notre Dame, New 
York and Montecito, designer John Saladino, was in the crowd, bringing Lyn and 
Norman Lear, whose house he's redesigning. Gothic collectors and former 
Pasadenans Jack and Jody Pike, now of San Juan Capistrano, beamed over their 
decorative contributions to the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Party chairman Electa Anderson and Gaye Birtcher, Joyce MacRae, Kay Evans and 
Bettie Auerbach made sure the overflow crowd got juggled. Philip and Sandy 
Jacoby, who are building the Marbella Golf and Country Club, donated $25,000 to 
underwrite the night, creating a lot of fun for everyone including Kay (she was 
chairman of exhibits) and Don Evans, Bud Sampson and Freda Weegar, Tom and Lucy 
Hartford, Harrison Negley, Judy and Steven Smith of La Jolla, Sandi and Tom 
Ewing, Dorothy and Don Koll, Gavin and Ninetta Herbert, John Benecke, Barbara

Warmington.

CELEBRATING LIFE: The late Joan Orr, wife of Verne Orr, former Secretary of the 
U.S. Air Force, succumbed in 1988 to Lou Gehrig's Disease, but before she died, 
she discovered a passion for creative dance -- and its therapeutic value. She 
reassembled the dance class she had led before the Orrs' departure to 
Washington. She also had been president of the Pasadena Arts Council and became 
the first chairwoman of the famed Bella Lewitzky Dance Company. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Light-Bringer Project, in association with the Pasadena Arts Council, 
paid tribute to her at Polytechnic School's Garland Auditorium last week, 
documenting her work on videotape ("A Question of Balance: The Life of Joan 
Orr"), showing her conducting classes from her wheelchair just two weeks before

<MEMO>  WEST CLOSE-UPS
INTERVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A. My mom calls me Alex.; Q. You've spoken and written quite a bit about your
mother, Charlotte Sheedy.; A. Both of my parents are really high achievers. My
mother was born in a very poor family, the only Jewish family in the black
section of Philadelphia, so they were, like, outcasts. She didn't graduate
from high school; she was illiterate and out on her own at 16, and today she
owns the Charlotte Sheedy Literary Agency in New York City.;    Q. Didn't she
try to steer you away from acting when you were a teen-ager?;    A. No, but
when I was acting in plays in New York, when I was 15, she hung up on someone
who called offering to help me get work in TV commercials. But she's really
honest: She told me she did it, and I called the woman back. Eventually I was
offered some commercials, and my mom and I had a fight about whether I should
take them.;    Q. Was your early success a heady experience for you -- getting
money and fame as a teen-ager?;    A. No, high achievement was the way I was
brought up. What I didn't expect was how a lot of people are put off if you're
successful. I wasn't prepared for the envy. It's still difficult. It's
difficult for me to make friends. And dating is hard sometimes; I don't always
know if the man is interested in me. And if you get involved with someone
who's prominent in his own right, that can be complicated. The only one of
those relationships that has worked for years and years is Paul Newman and
Joanne Woodward. I think the Demi Moore-Bruce Willis marriage will last.;   
Q. In 1985 you were in The Breakfast Club. I've heard of people who have seen
that film 30 or 40 times.;    A. It's a real cult favorite. I think it was so
popular because it expresses some emotional experiences that are pretty
universal. My character, Allison, has this scene -- she had been covering
herself up with makeup -- and she goes off with a friend and they take all
that stuff off, and she begins to see and reveal who she really is.;    Q. The
Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire, which you were also in, seem to fit
together, with many of the same actors doing a lot of soul-searching. Any
chance for a new movie that will follow up on the characters as they head into
their 30s?;    A. No, I don't think so. It would be so hard to get everyone
together. We're all over the place. I've kept in touch with that group. The
person I'm closest to is Demi Moore.;    Q. Has it been difficult for you to
make the transition from adolescent to adult roles?;    A. It has, I think
because I look a lot younger than my age. Sometimes I get turned down for
parts I want because "you're too young, you're too young." I still get sent
younger roles but I would rather work less and grow up. So I do one thing a
year. My part last summer in Betsy's Wedding was a breakthrough to adult parts
for me, playing this adult woman -- an adult woman who can't get a date!;   
Q. Didn't you buy rights to the book about rock 'n' roll groupies, I'm With
the Band, in hopes of developing a good role for yourself?;    A. Yes, but no
one wants to make that into a movie! I would hear from studio executives, "We
can't make a woman groupie into a sympathetic character." I think it would be
a terrific film if someone wonderful like Robert Altman wanted to do it and
focus on this really interesting woman and the whole '60s scene; it's not just
about some dead rock star. But it just hasn't happened. I give up.;    Q. In
your recent book of poetry, Yesterday I Saw the Sun, you write about some dark
times you've been through with addictions. You went to Hazelden, the
detox/rehab center?;    A. Yes. Those addictions and compulsive behaviors are
-- they're extremely powerful. I have great respect for them. It's something I
need to be aware of every day. Poetry helps me make sense of it all. I'm very
thankful I'm able to express myself with words. The poetry collection is my
second book, actually. I published She Was Nice to Mice when I was 12.;    Q.
One of your poems has a nice line about Hollywood: "driving down Sunset
Boulevard/her friends' faces/stare at her/from billboards.";    A. Those
billboards with 40-foot-tall faces, yes, it's a very, very strange feeling to
see your friends up there; there's no connection between that and the person
you know. It's even weirder when it's your own face. It's exciting; and also a
little bit unnerving. It made me nuts -- "Oh my God, now I have to live up to
this."  </TEXT>

<HL> McCall's and K mart Create a Magazine For Joint Promotion </HL>

<TEXT>
   McCall's magazine and K mart Corp. are teaming up to attract future readers and buyers by creating a new promotional magazine for six- to 12-year-old girls. 

   The minimagazine, to be called "Betsy McCall" after the McCall's paper doll character of the 1950s, will be given away at K mart discount stores and will be inserted in three issues of McCall's for the next two years, starting with the September issue. 
The big Troy, Mich.-based discounter also signed an exclusive licensing agreement to use the Betsy McCall name on products such as toys, clothing and accessories. 

   Arrangements like this between corporations and publishers are becoming more common now as publications search for new sources of advertising revenue. 
Advertising pages in McCall's, part of Working Woman/McCall's Group, have fallen 15.6% this year, according to Media Industry Newsletter. 
Meanwhile, more retailers, struggling to distinguish themselves at a time when stores are selling look-alike merchandise, are turning to joint marketing programs to develop exclusive products. 

   The new McCall's magazine will attempt to reach young girls through their mothers by capitalizing on baby boomers' nostalgia for the Betsy McCall doll of their youth. 
The minimagazine, which will be prepared by a promotional staff of McCall's, will be supported by advertising from K mart and its suppliers; it won't carry ads for other retailers. 
Five million copies will be inserted in McCall's, and a million more will be given away at K mart. 

   Under this arrangement, K mart will become one of McCall's top five advertisers, which means the retailer will contribute more than $1.5 million a year. 
The minimagazine's pages sell for more than McCall's usual rates; besides K mart, advertisers in the 16-page first issue include Pepsi, Mott's and Scripto. 

   "The magazine is written for and about young girls, an age group K mart hopes to attract as customers with this promotion," said Michael Wellman, K mart's vice president for marketing. 
"We want to appeal to these girls and keep them as lifelong K mart shoppers." 

   K mart also is launching other joint marketing ventures. 
Last year, the nation's second-largest retailer hired Martha Stewart, an author of books on lavish cooking and entertaining, as a celebrity spokeswoman. 
It is now developing an exclusive line of household merchandise that bears her name. 

   Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., meanwhile, is selling a line of McKids clothing under a licensing arrangement with McDonald's Corp. and is developing other children's products under a similar agreement with Walt Disney Co.

TESKE, HOFFENBERG BEAT THE PACK USING TEAM TACTICS TO FINISH 1-2

<P>
Team tactics paid off for Evan Teske and Mark Hoffenberg as they finished 
one-two in the men's 30-34 Criterium at the Great Earth Masters National 
Cycling Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the race, which consisted of over 100 cyclists, Teske and Hoffenberg worked 
together with teammates Tom Broznowski (of San Diego) and Danny Van Haute (of 
San Marcos) to take control of the field. (Broznowski and Van Haute race for 
Cycles Veloce). 
</P>
<P>
Teske crossed the finish line in 1:23.25 with Hoffenberg close behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We were planning to get a break away going with two to three guys and 
hopefully lap the field," said Teske, who rides for Nissan/Schwinn. "We wanted 
at least two guys in the top three." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hoffenberg, who rides for Vita-Crunch/Schwinn: "We wanted to send guys off 
in pairs. Danny and I were a pair and Tom and Evan were a pair. We just wanted 
the team to do well." 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the 47-lap, 60 kilometer race Broznowski and Steve Wood (of 
Brentwood), riding for Velo Club LaGrange, broke away from the pack and held 
the lead for eight laps before being absorbed by the field of racers. 
</P>
<P>
Wood again broke away, this time solo, with eight laps remaining in the race, 
but five laps later he dropped back into the pack. Wood finished third. 
Broznowski remained in the front of the field with two laps remaining but fell 
back and failed to place. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my best to get away because I'm normally not a very good sprinter," Wood 
said. "Then a big hole opened up." 
</P>
<P>
Teske was in the center of the pack when he saw his chance to break free. 
</P>
<P>
"I was boxed in really bad," Teske said. "Somewhere half-way down the stretch a 
hole opened up and I turned on the after burner." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hoffenberg: "When there was 100 meters to go and I saw my teammate's 
jersey, I was pretty confident it was Evan, I knew it was going to be a one-two 
finish. Evan just barely beat me. It was so close." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenberg had to rely on teammates to move ahead, because as the defending 
national champion he wore the red-white-and-blue jersey and was being 
challenged by other cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with wearing this jersey is they're not willing to let me go," 
Hoffenberg said. "With 10 laps to go I fell back and tried to remain 
inconspicuous." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Teske placed 13th in the Criterium, 10th in the road race and 10th in 
the time trials. He will be competing in the road race but decided not to do 
the time trials this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really just a criterium rider, a sprinter but I'm basically going to the 
road race to help the team," Teske said. 
</P>
<P>
Teske felt he had a good chance of winning, coming off two victories at a 
Masters Criterium in Temecula last weekend. He won the 30+ criterium and a 
category I-II race. 
</P>
<P>
A collision on the final stretch of the women's 35-39 race had a definite 
effect on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual winner was Karen Hornbostel of Louisville, Colo. with Camille Hood 
of Katy Texas close behind. 
</P>
<P>
Meg Berry (of Vista) and former national champion Betsy King (of Gainesville, 
Fla.) collided then crashed into the sideline fence and were unable to finish 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
There was a discrepancy among cyclists as to what actually occurred in the 
collision. Moments following the crash King began blaming it on Hood who was 
actually ahead of the group when the crash occured. 
</P>
<P>
King immediately left the race site and according to Race Director Mike 
McCollum, King went to the hospital with a deep puncture wound in her arm. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, who lost consciousness, was treated by American Red Cross medics for a 
badly bruised arm and abrasions on her hip. 
</P>
<P>
"I was passing everyone. I was coming on the inside of Betsy King. She knew I 
could win so she plowed me into the fence. I was going about 40 miles an hour 
when I hit," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda Stein (of Laguna Beach) who was riding my wheel said she saw Betsy plow 
into me then someone ran into her. Betsy said that someone ran into her but she 
was the one to hit me first." 
</P>
<P>
Local rider Tisha Whitney, of Irvine, who rides with San Diego Cyclo-Vets, won 
the national title in the women's 40-44 race in 56:47.

<HEAD>Americans Eager to Wave the Flag for Lithuania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush may be reluctant to recognize
Lithuania's new government, but customers at a colorful stand in
Union Station's Main Hall are eager to wave the flag.
   They're so eager that there's been a run on Lithuanian flags,
patches, key chains and lapel pins at Alamo Flags, where manager
Dante Payne's order book amounts to a weathervane of world events.
   ``People will come by and say, `I heard about it on the news.
Give me one.' They think freedom is great,'' Payne said.
   In the past week, Payne has sold about 100 of his 4-by-6-inch
flags at $3.99 each, and 25 of the demonstration-size 3-by-5-foot
banners for $35.
   ``I have to order at least twice a week,'' Payne said from his
stand in Washington's elegantly renovated main train station. ``You
can see we've almost sold out of patches. There's just one left.''
   Patches sell for $4. For Lithuania supporters who want to show
the yellow, green and red colors more discreetly, key chains and
lapel pins are priced at $3.99 each.
   Payne said many of his customers are Americans with Lithuanian
roots, others buy in bulk for demonstrations and the rest are
mostly curious passers-by.
   Dan Raber, a 17-year-old high school student from Kingsport,
Tenn., falls into another category: the motivated collector.
   ``I collect flags from different countries,'' he said. ``With
all this going on and Lithuania becoming a brand-new nation, I
thought it would be interesting to get a flag of theirs.''
   While he was at it, Raber picked up little flags from Estonia
and Latvia in case Lithuania's Baltic neighbors follow it down the
tricky path toward independence from the Soviet Union.
   Some other Washington-based flag outlets reported no special
increase in Lithuanian flag sales.
   ``I have had some calls, I wouldn't say dozens by any means,''
said Diane Wolter, a saleswoman for Betsy Ross Flag Girls Inc.
   But she said political currents do affect the flag business.
   ``Since the Berlin Wall came down, there's been a lot of
interest in Eastern Europe,'' she said. ``When we had this
flag-burning thing, that increased business tremendously.''
   The extra sales were to flag supporters, she hastened to add,
not to people wanting to set the stars and stripes ablaze.
   At Union Station, Payne said demand for the Lithuanian flag has
not matched the rush for Czechoslovakian flags last November or for
African National Congress banners when Nelson Mandela was freed in
South Africa in February.
   Alamo Flags boasts that it stocks flags from every country and
all 50 states.
   ``Namibia is the only one we don't have because it just became a
country,'' Payne said. ``But we should have it by the end of the
week.''

Eloise the Perfect Shopper:
Toys Are Her Department

Joanne Kaufman</HL>
<DD> 12/18/86</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eloise Lipscomb is like a kid in a toy store. 
Come to think of it, Eloise Lipscomb, though 25, is a kid in a toy store. 
As one of two personal shoppers at F.A.O. Schwarz, she escorts the rich, the sometimes famous and the frequently confused through 37,000 square feet of things that talk, glow, roar, rev and go beep in the night. 
And she is fully capable of having a spirited, even meaningful discussion with a barking, whimpering puppet dog or with a bear whose ursine gibberish generally makes sense only to a highly imaginative child. 

   "I definitely have a child's mind," says Ms. Lipscomb. 
She'd better. 
Many department stores have personal shoppers, but they tend to be generalists. 
Ms. Lipscomb has been a Schwarz personal shopper for three years, specializing, as the store does, only in toys. 
It's gotten to the point where she takes her work home with her. 
Her Greenwich Village apartment houses an antique teeter-totter used as a coffee table, a baby doll, two pull toys, a train set and several teddy bears. 

   "I know exactly why kids like things right away," she says. 
"I have a very good memory of my childhood. 
I remember what I liked at a lot of different ages." 
Being named Eloise also adds to Ms. Lipscomb's professional credibility. 
Some of the store's young patrons are convinced she's Kay Thompson's heroine grown up and on loan from the Plaza Hotel just across Fifth Avenue. 

   And like the original Eloise, Ms. Lipscomb is ready to tell grown-ups what to do. 
When a client announces that he's shopping for a three-year-old boy, count on Ms. Lipscomb to plump for a wooden train that connects with magnets. 
For a five year old, she advises the aforementioned vociferous puppet dog. 

   "Ten," confides Ms. Lipscomb, "is a tricky time because if you give kids immature toys they feel like they're being treated like a baby, but they still like toys. 
I can tell people exactly how a 10 year old is going to react to things." (A 10 year old, she believes, will react badly to the offer of a child doll. 
Better to go with an adult doll, a telescope or a chemistry set.) 

   If she's working with a new client, Ms. Lipscomb will ask the child's age, gender and favored activities. 
"As I start walking people around the store and telling them about the different products it becomes clear what their children like. 
I never ask how much they want to spend, but it becomes evident very quickly." 

   Certain clients like grandfather and chicken king Frank Perdue refuse to tour the sales floor and will simply bring in a shopping list. 
"I think it's better to walk the store because it definitely increases the sale," says Ms. Lipscomb. 

   Over the Christmas season she will average three or four customers a day, both walk-ins and appointments. 
Her Museum of Modern Art calendar is laced with names such as Gayfryd Steinberg, the wife of financier Saul Steinberg; the Steinbergs' two-year-old daughter, Holden (who brings her nanny); Richard Thomas; Michael Jackson (who generally comes disguised in a wig, a mask or a mustache); Christie Brinkley; Whoopi Goldberg; Betsy Bloomingdale; Diana Ross; and Katharine Graham. 

   Being rich and famous is not, however, a prerequisite for the privilege of walking the floor with Ms. Lipscomb, although most of her 100 regular clients think nothing of running up a $2,000-plus tab at Christmas. 
"A personal shopper sale of $1,000 is no big deal," says Ms. Lipscomb, who in Imelda Marcos's palmier days sold her a "toy" red Mercedes for $7,500. 
"You start getting impressed around $5,000." 

   "But if people want a personal shopper and they want to spend $20, they want to spend $10, it's okay," says the store's general manager, Cathy Windt. 
"If they spend $5, if they spend $5,000 we offer them the same service." 

   That service can include a walk-through on a Sunday morning before official store hours, as it did recently for Schlumberger heiress and fashion designer Christophe de Menil, her daughter Taya Snow, Taya's three children, Caroline, Dash and Max, two nannies and a family friend. 

   "I want the clock," whispers two-year-old Max staring in awe at the two-story F.A.O. Schwarz symbol dominating the entrance to the store. 

   "Why does Dash want Inhumanoids for Christmas?" his mother wants to know in some distress. 

   "Because they're ugly," says Ms. Lipscomb with the resigned air of someone who knows better than to argue with a five year old. 

   "I want a trillion of them," says Dash, now busy with the remote-control cars. 

   "Does your daughter need Barbie accessories?" asks Ms. Lipscomb, who knows from previous outings with the de Menils that Caroline already has Barbie's car, hot tub and horse and trailer. 

   "She should have the vanity, some new Barbie clothes, and she needs some more Barbies," says Ms. Snow. 
"Maybe the Peruvian and Greek Barbie and Rocker Barbie. 
Maybe I'll get two Rocker Barbies. 
But I don't know if we want the Barbie workout center." 

   "Do you like dolls, Caroline?" asks Mrs. de Menil, busily adding to her shopping list as the group stops at the Raggedy Ann display. 
"Dash likes to make things. 
But we haven't gotten to his department yet." 

   "Read off that list. 
I want to take off all the outrageous things," murmured Ms. Snow as soon as her indulgent mother was out of earshot. 

   "I want the clock," whispers Max as the de Menils make a hurried exit a few minutes after the store opens at noon, leaving behind a formidable list of stuffed animals, blocks, dolls, doll clothes, cars, castles, Jungle Gyms, books and puppets totaling $3,000 to $4,000 -- and they'll be back. 

   "The de Menils are wonderful because they know what they want," says Ms. Lipscomb. 
"People who can't make up their minds are the hardest part of the job. 
I don't like to push things down their throats but I get impatient with 'I don't know.'" 

   Ms. Lipscomb also gets impatient with parents who want to push their offspring into toys that are beyond them -- for example, a computer for a newborn or a train for a six month old. 
"They'll say 'my child is only three but she's a genius and I know she's ready for this six-year-old educational toy.' 

   "Parents are worse offenders than grandparents," Ms. Lipscomb says. 
"Grandparents are objective when they should be. 

   "I'm really compulsive," says Ms. Lipscomb, who lives by two abiding rules: 1. 
Test the toy. 2. 
Include batteries. 
"Last year, a customer bought three remote-control cars for his kids and I forgot to enclose batteries. 
So I hand delivered them with an apologetic note." 

   Right now, however, batteries are the least of her concerns. 
"I have one customer who has 11 children and comes in and does a separate personal shop for each one," she sighs. 
"He just spent $1,500 on his 11-year-old daughter. 
And he has 10 kids to go."

<HL> RJR Wants to Leave Winston-Salem, N.C., for Atlanta

Move Reflects Nabisco Brands'
Increasing Influence Over Its Parent

<TEXT>
   Winston-Salem, N.C., without R.J. Reynolds would be like Hershey, Pa., without Hershey, or Detroit without General Motors. 
Unthinkable. 

   But if any doubt remains that tobacco no longer dominates RJR Nabisco Inc., it will be erased this week when the company unveils a proposal once considered sacrilege: moving the corporate headquarters to Atlanta. 

   The management is expected to propose the shift south to its board Thursday, according to sources close to RJR. 
It has been looking for office space in Atlanta and would move 300 of its current 1,000-member headquarter staff there, the sources said. 
About 200 to 500 employees will be laid off, according to varying accounts from RJR executives, with the remainder reassigned to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem and other operating units. 

   RJR will continue to maintain two major tobacco plants and more than 13,000 employees in Winston-Salem. 

   Nevertheless, the move is a bold first strike by F. Ross Johnson, the former Nabisco chief executive officer who became RJR's new chief only 12 days ago. 
It signals that under Mr. Johnson, RJR will no longer be tied to its staid tobacco heritage. 

   The proposal also confirms rampant fears in Winston-Salem that while it was RJR that paid $4.9 billion to acquire Nabisco Brands Inc. in 1985, it is Nabisco that has truly taken over. 

   "The word 'Reynolds' and Winston-Salem are more or less synonymous," said Wayne A. Corpening, the city's mayor, responding to press reports of RJR moving plans. 
"I didn't sleep much last night," Mr. Corpening added. 

   For Winston-Salem, with a 1980 population of 132,000, the loss of RJR is the loss of a resident corporate patron saint. 
Through much of the last century, RJR has hired entire families, and provided them with low-cost housing, day care, even band concerts and baseball games. 

   It was RJR, or its founders, who helped give Winston-Salem a center for the arts, influenced Wake Forest University to come to the city and raised a building so striking -- the tobacco company's headquarters built in 1929 -- it served as a model for New York's famed Empire State Building. 

   But the announcement last August that Mr. Johnson would succeed J. Tylee Wilson as chief executive was handwriting on the wall for many Winston-Salem residents. 
Since then, several top RJR posts have been filled with Mr. Johnson's top aides from Nabisco and RJR employees let go. 
Rumors had it that RJR would move its headquarters either to New York or the East Hanover, N.J., headquarters of its Nabisco Brands Inc. unit. 

   But as recently as late last week, the company denied it would leave Winston-Salem, insisting that Mr. Johnson had bought a house there and that he had even plunged into civic activities, such as heading up a major fund-raising effort for the North Carolina Zoological Society. 
Now an RJR spokesman refuses to confirm or deny the proposed move to Atlanta. 

   Though seemingly a bolt from the blue, a move to Atlanta makes sense for RJR. Atlanta's airport is much more accessible than Winston-Salem for travel from offices in New York and New Jersey and RJR's extensive overseas operations. 

   Moreover, bustling, cosmopolitan Atlanta is a much more suitable home for Mr. Johnson, a hard-driving, hard-playing executive who thrives on late-night business meetings, glitzy golf tournaments, and famous friends, the likes of which include athletes Frank Gifford, Bobby Orr, and the Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney. 

   The move also makes sense for a paternalistic, old-fashioned company that has had trouble making the bloody break with its tradition. 
Although the company has been placing substantial investments outside of tobacco for 10 years now, it has continued to retain the image of "a tobacco company with other interests," says an executive. 
Although Mr. Johnson's predecessor Mr. Wilson boldly bought businesses and sold them -- including Kentucky Fried Chicken and Canada Dry -- his management was slow to cut the umbilical cord to Winston-Salem. 
Mr. Wilson remains chairman until next year. 

   Bringing the company to Atlanta would drive home Mr. Johnson's new strategy, which is to refit RJR with a more modern holding company structure, using a lean headquarters staff to provide limited support to four major, highly autonomous operating units. 
RJR has a total of 130,000 employees world-wide. 

   Tobacco will continue to be a major business, in addition to the food and liquor businesses. 
Tobacco contributes roughly 40% of sales and 64% of earnings. 
RJR had third-quarter net income of $750 million, or $2.62 a share, on sales of $14 billion. 

   In recent months, management has been reviewing the headquarters jobs, with an eye toward sharply trimming staff. 
When the process is completed in March, the headquarters will be trimmed to about 300 employees, who would move to Atlanta. 
While that number isn't so huge, RJR would become the biggest corporation headquartered in Atlanta, whose corporate landscape is now dominated by Coca-Cola Co. 

   The possible move also fuels speculation that First Wachovia Corp., a combination of First Atlanta Corp. and Wachovia Corp., of Winston-Salem, would also shift headquarters to Atlanta. 
Currently the bank holding company has headquarters in both cities. 
Atlanta's hyperactive commercial real estate community is said to be licking its chops over both prospects.

Why was Oscar de la Renta gracing the UCLA Art Council with his handsome 
presence and a view of his Fall 1989 Collection on the lawn at Hotel Bel-Air? 
He mused, "Well, Betsy Bloomingdale." Said Betsy: "Did he say that? How nice. 
Well, my daughter Lisa (Bell) is very involved with the council's Thieves 
Market." 
</P>
<P>
Saks Fifth Avenue hosted the event and underwrote everything. The elegant De la 
Renta, tanned from salmon fishing on the Cascapidian in Quebec, brought along 
his friend, Annette Reed, for the show, which was designed to boost the revival 
of the Thieves Market to be held Oct. 27-28 at Santa Monica Airport Center. 
That's the one co-chairs Marian Mandel and Muriel Simkin are pounding the 
pavement for, collecting antiques, memorabilia, art, silver, furs -- everything 
but the sofa. 
</P>
<P>
At the runway-end vantage point, Nancy Mehta, with a patch on her right cheek, 
sat next to Betsy Bloomingdale, Betsy next to Merv Adelson, Merv next to 
Barbara Walters. Fashion doyennes such as Mary Lazar (who hosted a party for 
Oscar and Annette), Patricia Ward, Pat York (with Michael), Helene Irvin (with 
Richard) and Patty Fox gushed over the couture. Gloria Luchenbill sang the 
words to "Begin the Beguine" as the couturier's black velvet dresses sashayed 
on the runway, and when the breeze billowed the chartreuse chiffon gown, she 
gasped: "I want that; I'll take it right now."

   Parents and Children on Trial

<LP>
   It seems like only yesterday that the mother of all child
sex abuse circuses -- the McMartin Preschool trial in
California ended with the prosecution thoroughly routed. The
McMartin jurors acquitted the defendants on the ground that
the charges put before them were, to say the least, not
credible. The verdict ended years of nightmares for the
defendants, but could hardly undo the emotional and financial
ruin inflicted over five years of a lurid investigation and
trial. When the preposterousness of the prosecutors' charges
and evidence, the techniques of the state's child therapists
(who put the abuse charges into childrens' mouths) all stood
revealed, it was said that the lesson of the McMartin case
would prevent such cruel fiascos from recurring. But as the
remarkable two-hour "Frontline" film by Ofra Bikel titled
"Innocence Lost" reveals (9-11 p.m. EDT tomorrow, on PBS), we
are about to see McMartin II take place in Edenton, N.C. The
program covers the investigations and the pre-trial hearings.
The actual trial will begin early in June.
   This time the people caught up in charges of child sex
abuse are the owners and teachers of the Little Rascals
nursery school. Edenton is, as its name suggests, an idyllic
setting, steeped in colonial history. In this green and
pleasant place, the child sex abuse fever has struck with a
vengeance, as it has in other towns in the nation where, in
the last decade, a single anonymous accusation has been
enough to set off an investigation, leading to charges
rapidly multiplying into the hundreds, and extending to an
ever wider circle of people accused -- usually nursery school
teachers or other child care workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Edenton, what began with one child soon progressed to a
point where prosecutors were claiming 90 children had been
abused. That the filmmakers deliver this anatomy of a child
abuse prosecution with calm even-handedness makes the story
they tell no less chilling. For this is, make no mistake, an
indictment -- and not of the defendants. It is a memorable
work on many counts, not least its assortment of fools,
villains, innocents and also (though by no means so
numerous), its heroes.
   One of the more unforgettable sequences stars the former
best friend of the accused Betsy Kelly (who ran the nursery
school along with her husband Bob, the chief defendant). The
best friend, an articulate, vivacious woman, as so many of
the parents are, tells how her small son said he had been
slapped at Betsy and Bob's nursery school, and how when she
heard that, she knew life would never be the same. She also
relates, in passionate detail, her growing fury at Betsy, how
she wanted Betsy to plead for forgiveness, which she wouldn't
do; how all she wanted was for Betsy to beg her to bring her
son back, which Betsy also neglected to do.
   Shortly thereafter, the former friend says, she fell to
ruminating that things didn't seem right at the school. Child
welfare investigators were soon all over the place.
   This entire piece of self-revelation, whose meaning will
be lost on no viewer, is related eagerly, without awareness
of the implications. It is in short, the purest drama. The
entire hour-and-a-half of the film (to be followed by a
half-hour panel discussion) is similarly ironic, gripping,
and saturated with enough passion, betrayal, and menace to
carry several miniseries.
   Here, as in the McMartin case and similar ones,
prosecutorial zeal runs high. A few parents, maintaining
their skepticism about the charges, let it be known that they
don't believe anything happened to their children or anyone
else's. For that lack of belief, they have been punished with
hints and open threats of dire consequences.
   One such mother, who overheard her own small son's
statements being twisted into testimony of abuse by the
state's child therapist, went to the prosecutor, furious that
her child's name had been put on the list of plaintiffs. The
district attorney advised her not to go public with her
skepticism, because, he warned her, she had been named by
many children as a participant in the abuse.
   Another mother who refused to credit the abuse charges
finds that investigators are sniffing around asking questions
about her character. One of the state's therapists accuses
her of being a neglectful mother.
   There is no denying the attractiveness, innocence, and
plain confusion of some of the plaintiff parents. An attorney
-- said to be the most prominent in town -- at first
represented the chief defendant, Bob Kelly, until the good
people of Edenton spread the rumor that the lawyer's own
small son was among the abused. The attorney became an
instant and total believer. He abandoned the defense
forthwith -- and also, apparently, his capacity for
skepticism. One has the feeling that his departure was not
the worst thing in the world to happen to the defense.
   Here as everywhere else, the film maintains its polite,
even-handed stance -- but even-handedness can't diminish the
impact of the facts put before us, all of which suggest the
frenzy to convict, the fantastic nature of the charges. The
narrator reports in an entirely neutral tone one of the
children's more noteworthy accusations: The teachers had
cooked her in a microwave oven.
   The film is not without flaws, for example the somewhat
overworked motif of a peaceful Eden, where things like this
aren't supposed to happen. It is the sort of easy paradox
beloved by TV. More important, the film does all too little
to explain the exotic interrogation techniques the
prosecutors' therapists used on small children, so as to
produce accusations of abuse. But none of that much
diminishes the extraordinary power of this work.
   As this story unfolds, a defendant has no idea where the
abuse is supposed to have taken place -- all over town, the
children say -- and the defense lawyers are refused normal
access to trial materials. One is reminded of a recent
constitutional rights literacy test whose dismaying results
showed a huge proportion of those tested thought the
defendant had to prove his innocence in court. The testees
must have spent a lot of time watching child sex abuse
trials.

<HEAD>Flag Burning Popular, But Most Legislatures Closed for the Year</HEAD>

   A constitutional amendment to protect the Stars and Stripes
enjoys wide popularity in state legislatures, but most of them have
finished their business for the year and won't consider
ratification anytime soon.
   ``There will be overwhelming support,'' said Georgia state Rep.
Bill Lee, chairman of the House Rules Committee. ``I'd lead the
charge.'' But Georgia, like more than half the states, has no
regular legislative session set until 1991.
   An Associated Press survey of state legislative leaders found
strong support in more than half of the nation's statehouses for an
amendment banning flag desecration.
   But skepticism in more than a dozen states, and legislative
timetables, mean there will be no rush to ratification even if
Congress approves an amendment this summer. The delay could give
emotions time to die down and opponents time to regroup.
   The Supreme Court issued its 5-4 decision June 11 _ three days
before Flag Day _ that flag burning is a form of political protest
protected by the First Amendment. The ruling threw out a law passed
by Congress after a similar high court ruling a year ago.
   Republican leaders immediately vowed to press for a 27th
Amendment to the Constitution. They are aiming for a vote before
July 4.
   Such a measure would have to pass Congress by a two-thirds vote
in each house and then be ratified by legislatures in
three-quarters, or 38, of the states.
   An AP survey following the Supreme Court decision found strong
support for the amendment, particularly in the South and Midwest.
   Legislative leaders stressed that the situation could change,
particularly since most votes would take place after the November
elections.
   Among the states where the amendment's chances look good:
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New
Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
West Virginia and Wyoming.
   In many of those states, legislators angered by last year's
Supreme Court decision have already passed some law or resolution
against flag burning.
   In Pennsylvania, home of Betsy Ross, resolutions asking Congress
to seek a flag-burning amendment easily passed both chambers, and
similar action is predicted on ratification.
   ``In this state, it would be like voting against apple pie or
motherhood,'' said Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Mellow, a
Democrat.
   States where skeptics could force a fight include Alaska,
Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Washington
and Wisconsin.
   In New York, the powerful Assembly speaker, Democrat Mel Miller,
strongly opposes an amendment and is in a position to block it.
   Only a handful of states have year-round legislatures; by
mid-June, most legislatures have adjourned for the year or are near
adjournment, including most of the states most strongly behind the
amendment.
   Louisiana's House has passed a bill reducing to a token fine the
penalty for beating up a flag-burner. A Senate committee endorsed
that bill last week. But the Legislature adjourns July 9.
   Illinois' Legislature adjourns June 30, but Gov. James Thompson,
a Republican, said Friday he would call a special session to hasten
a ratification vote.
   The last amendment to the Constitution, which lowered the voting
age to 18, took a little more than three months from its passage in
Congress in March 1971 to its ratification by 38 states.
   This time, with all but a handful of legislatures finished for
the year, or nearly so, no such speedy action is possible.
   ``It would be a five-year process if it worked,'' said the
majority leader in the Arizona Senate, Republican John Mawhinney.
``It would not be something that rolled through. We would not push
to be the first state.''

   Arthur Encalade was philosophical about
Florence, the hurricane that chased him from his home exactly 23
years after an equally rude uprooting at the hands of Hurricane
Betsy.
   As he sat among 1,200 other evacuees at Belle Chasse High School
just south of New Orleans on Friday night, the 69-year-old Encalade
said living through storms is a way of life.
   ``People live all their lives down here,'' he said. ``You hate
to leave. You go somewhere else and a tornado will take you or
something else will.
   ``It's discouraging, but what are you going to do?'' he said.
``If you're too old, you can't go far.''
   Florence was at hurricane strength Friday when the evacuees left
their low-lying homes, but lost its punch as it brushed the coast
and was downgraded to a tropical storm this morning.
   Thousands of residents of coastal areas in Mississippi, Alabama
and Florida also took refuge in shelters and homes of relatives and
friends on higher ground.
   Despite an almost casual acceptance of his situation, Encalade
said previous storms have cost him dearly.
   ``When Camille (in 1969) and Betsy came over, they cleaned us
out. I lost two houses,'' he said.
   Now Encalade lives in a trailer in Buras on the tip of the
Mississippi Delta.
   ``We've got it anchored,'' he said. ``But if the storm passes
over it's going to take it anyway. So you just lock it up and come
up here and see what happens.''
   At the school, cots were set up in the gym, with large families
grouped in classrooms. Some people brought TV sets and suitcases
with changes of clothes.
   Sitting on cots, Walter and Melodia Buras of Boothville were a
little more pragmatic than Encalade.
   ``I've been in this school three times already,'' Mrs. Buras
said. ``Once for Betsy and once for Camille. When it's a hurricane,
I'm gone.''
   They said they normally ride out weaker storms at home, but
anytime a hurricane nears shore they head for higher ground.
   Mrs. Buras said her quick departures when bad weather threatens
sometimes draw jokes from neighbors.
   ``They laugh at us when we get back, but I'd rather be safe.''
   Many shared the same outlook at St. Bernard High School east of
New Orleans, where 170 evacuees took refuge.
   ``Where we live is `God's Little Acre,''' said Ruth Gonzales,
65, of Delcroix Island. ``It's the best place to live even though
every time a storm comes through, we've got to go.''
   So why not move?
   ``If our home's destroyed, we'll make another government loan
and build again,'' she said.

<P>
THE MOVIE: "Betsy's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE: Molly Ringwald (Betsy) plays a betrothed fashion design student. Her 
father (Alan Alda), mother (Madeline Kahn), sister (Ally Sheedy) and fiance 
(Dylan Walsh) are stultifying characters who distract from the two best parts 
of the film -- the sartorially splendid, cartoon-gangster Tony Dee, played by 
Anthony La Paglia and Betsy's wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Costume designer Mary Malin created Ringwald's wannabe designer 
wardrobe by cleaning out her own closet and jewelry stash. She asked for 
contributions from her staff and even used some of Ringwald's own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The eclectic style does not work to Ringwald's advantage. She looks awkward in 
a '50s leopard fur toque with a short-sleeve red dress and red wrist-length 
gloves. Over-the-top fashion statements worked for Bernadette Peters in "Slaves 
of New York" but on Ringwald they look ridiculous, especially with a pillbox 
hat perched on her forehead, as if she were a carhop. The only clothes that she 
wears with any sort of conviction are the frilly dress for an opera scene and 
her wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony La Paglia, on the other hand, doesn't have a bit of trouble wearing the 
double-breasted, washed silk suits with peak lapels that look like a mountain 
range across his chest, and ties that are so loud they're deafening. He wears 
this grotesque wardrobe with a Cary Grant-like panache. 
</P>
<P>
THE STORES: Malin swears Ringwald's wardrobe has no certain store lineage. It 
was begged, borrowed or uncovered in the back rooms and sale racks of 
department stores. The wedding dress goes through such a transformation, from 
traditional to funky neo-nuptial, Malin feels it would be cruel to name the 
original designer. Customizing yields a Marie Antoinette-style frock with a 
decollete bodice and a swagged overskirt with a multicolored, multitiered 
underskirt of lace ruffles. Malin confessed the actual transformation took 
weeks of stitching in the workroom. 
</P>
<P>
La Paglia's suits came from Italy and from designers Hugo Boss and Bill 
Kaiserman. To find these eye-popping pieces, Malin said, "Well, let's just say 
I did very well in the (San Fernando) Valley." 
</P>
<P>
THE PAYOFF: Ringwald's converted wedding dress (pictured), worn with a white 
top hat and mid-calf length white boots, is surprisingly appealing. The white 
satin top hat is an especially nice touch. GAILE ROBINSON

<LEADPARA>  HATRED, imprisonment, torture, starvation, violent death, war, genocide. Less
than a generation ago these were considered mature topics from which children,
especially young children, needed to be carefully shielded.;   Today, however,
that sentiment has changed. If the next generation is to do something about
the evils of the world, say some writers, educators and activists, children
need to be aware of these issues at an early age. One result is the increasing
number of picture books for preschoolers on previously taboo subjects such as
the Holocaust and Hiroshima.  </LEADPARA>

A NEW VARIETY OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS DISCUSSES THE
HORRORS OF HISTORY.
BUT ARE KIDS READY FOR IT?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Family  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The new crop includes:;   (check) "Let the Celebrations Begin!" (Orchard,
$14.95), a picture book for preschoolers about a young girl confined in
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany during World War II, the camp
where Anne Frank died.;   (check) "Rose Blanche" (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang,
$15.95), a reissued picture book, translated from the original Italian, which
tells the story of a German girl who secretly takes food to Jewish children
held in a concentration camp near her village. The girl is subsequently shot
by Nazi soldiers.;   (check) "My Hiroshima" (Viking, $12.95), a picture book
that recounts the author's memories of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, when
she was a child.;   (check) "The Wall" (Clarion, $13.95), a picture book that
follows a young boy and his father on a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
in Washington, D.C., where they find the name of his grandfather etched on the
long black wall.;   "We're seeing a lot of books about World War II and
tremendous cataclysms coming out today, more than we've seen in a long time,"
says Ann Flowers, editor of the Boston-based Horn Book Guide, a respected
review of children's books. "Society has opened up, and people are beginning
to talk about these things more freely, and children do share more adult
concerns today.";   Although national sales figures haven't been compiled on
the most recent titles, owners of local children's bookstores say sales are
brisk.;   "Seventeen years ago we certainly had books about World War II for
readers 11 years old and up," says Harriet Zander, a former school
psychologist who owns Chanticleer bookstore in Los Gatos. "But now we're
getting requests for titles for younger and younger children." Most of the
requests, says Zander, come from teachers.;   Shula Raz, a kindergarten
teacher at Yavnev Jewish Day School in Los Gatos, has been talking about the
Holocaust with her 5-year-olds for nine years. Raised in Israel and the child
of Holocaust survivors, Raz, 44, often uses her own family's remembrances and
photographs to tell the story as simply and truthfully as she can.;   "What I
tell them depends entirely on the maturity level of the class," Raz says. "If
they ask specific questions, I will answer them. And sometimes I will show
them pictures of my sister and say, 'This girl is not alive any more. She was
killed because she was Jewish.' ";   To introduce the Holocaust, Raz says she
sometimes picks out children in her class who have black hair and brown eyes
and tells them they cannot go outside to play, or that they have to sit on
their hands all day.;   "I tell them to do something really strange, and then
I ask, 'Can you feel how children must have felt when they had to put on the
yellow star?';   "I don't dwell on it, and I don't overload them. But I answer
their questions, and I try to get them to think about how they should behave
to other people.";   Raz says she's never been approached by a parent who's
told her she's teaching the Holocaust to children who are too young. "Just the
contrary. They come in and tell me they want to hear the stories personally
that their children have been bringing home.";   Berry Kane, the father of two
children taught by Raz, says he doubts his youngsters had a "full appreciation
for the seriousness and gravity of the subject" at the age of 5 or 6. But he
approves of what they have learned in school, and he and his wife encourage
questions at home.;   "Our daughter, Emily, is 9 now, and she has begun to ask
why the Holocaust happened," Kane says. "It's hard to explain anti-Semitism
and thousands of years of history, but the simplest response I've found is to
tell her that oftentimes what people don't understand, they fear. And I tell
her, 'If you don't understand something, try and learn about it and see what's
good about it, rather than letting ignorance, or fear, or hatred govern you.'
";   Picture books in kindergarten;   Raz uses several picture books about the
Holocaust in her kindergarten classroom, including "The Children We Remember"
by Chana Byers Abells (Greenwillow, $9.95), a photographic essay of children
who died in concentration camps. During the Holocaust memorial period on the
Hebrew calendar, she also shows the children a picture book about the dropping
of the first atomic bomb.;   "Hiroshima No Pika" by Toshi Maruki (Lothrop,
$13.00) is based on the remembrances of a Japanese mother who lived through
the Hiroshima horror. The text is straightforward in its explanation that many
people and animals died in the fires. The watercolor illustrations evoke
images of intense suffering and confusion.;   "The pictures are very shocking,
but the book helps me tell kindergartners that another kind of Holocaust
happened to other people," says Raz. "And I think that's important for them to
understand." Some observers see the volume of recently published books about
the Holocaust as a natural extension of concerns that began to surface in the
late 1960s and early '70s.;   "The library profession made a strong statement
at that time that children's books should be reflecting children's worlds,"
says Betsy Hearne, editor of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books
at the University of Chicago.;   As a result, such issues as child abuse, AIDS
and death are included in a growing body of children's literature.;  
Ironically, the recently published "Let the Celebrations Begin!" is drawing
criticism from children's books specialists today, not because it is too
hard-hitting for a preschool audience, but because some critics say it glosses
over the Holocaust.;   Written by Margaret Wild and illustrated by Julie
Vivas, the book focuses on a time when the prisoners at Belsen were
anticipating liberation by the British. Polish women in the camp began
collecting scraps of material and buttons to make toys for a children's
party.;   Although the story is based on a brief historical account, the
occasionally lighthearted tone of the text and the lively watercolor
illustrations are both jarring and hard to believe, given the documented
suffering at the camp.;   "Why is there a compulsion in children's books to
give the Holocaust a happy ending?" writes Hazel Rochman, assistant editor of
the youth section of the American Library Association's Booklist, in the
August, 1991 issue. "In this picture book aimed at preschoolers, Belsen is a
summer camp with bunk beds, sweet secrets, homesickness and leapfrog games in
the sun.";   Rochman, a former librarian and native of South Africa who
recently edited a collection of short stories about apartheid for teen-agers,
is concerned that "Let the Celebrations Begin!" is an overly sentimentalized
story that leaves out the atrocities of the Holocaust.;   "The British troops
found 10,000 unburied bodies when they entered Belsen, and 300 people died
each day during the ensuing weeks," Rochman said in a telephone interview. "To
show children laughing and playing is to give slick comfort and a false
impression. No one had enough energy even to move. It wasn't a party.";   Does
this kind of criticism mean that children's authors should steer clear of
concentration-camp stories? No, says the Bulletin's Betsy Hearne. What's
important is whether the material remains true to the events that are depicted
and how adults share controversial books with children.;   And there can be
other problems. Hearne, for example, criticizes "Rose Blanche," which looks
like a picture book but is more appropriate for older readers. The
illustrations by Roberto Innocenti border on the surreal, and at least one
page, which shows a young boy being taken prisoner by Nazi soldiers, derives
from a famous wartime photograph.;   Are children ready?;   "There are so many
references like that (to the well-known photograph) that children wouldn't
understand," Hearne says. "And I think the ending is pretty ambiguous, too.
Kids really wouldn't have a clue what was happening.";   Given these and other
artistic problems, perhaps the fundamental question that needs to be asked is:
Are children of preschool age really equipped to understand and respond in a
constructive way to the violence and hatred that surround the Holocaust?;  
"My hunch is that at about the age of 10 or 11, kids would begin to get a much
better grasp on the Holocaust," says Robin Keller, a Berkeley psychotherapist
who has studied more than 140 Bay Area adults who are children of Holocaust
survivors.;   "But so much depends on the way in which information about the
Holocaust is communicated," she adds. "Some families have told their children
about the Holocaust in a very guilt-inducing way, and children exposed to that
kind of environment have later tended to distance themselves from their
families.;   "On the other hand, when information about the Holocaust has been
related in an educational or historical way, then it hasn't seemed to have a
negative effect. If there's been an openness to questions in a family, there's
much more interest in and acceptance of the Holocaust.";   Writing before they
die; The current interest in children's books about the Holocaust and other
war-related events can be attributed to several factors, say experts such as
the Horn Book's Flowers. For one thing, there are many authors who have lived
quietly with their memories for many years and now want to get their stories
into print before they die.;   "I think some things are just too deep to be
talked about for quite a while for the people who've lived through them,"
Flowers says. "It often takes a long time for honest feelings to be expressed
in artistic ways, particularly in fine literature.";   In fact, some new books
about World War II for older readers are adding new dimensions to the genre,
says ALA Booklist's Rochman. "The Man From the Other Side," a story about a
young boy and his father who help rescue Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, recently
translated from the Hebrew by Hilel Halkin, is breaking new ground in several
ways, she says.;   "For the first time that I can remember in a young-adult
book, the Jews aren't presented as an amorphous mass of victims and heroes,"
Rochman notes. "Some are brave and some are traitors. There's a real range of
individuals.;   "It's an exciting story, and it's also a story about moral
choice."  </TEXT>

   A high school's 22-year-old tradition of
a father-son banquet is getting a makeover _ mothers are now
welcome.
   The change came about after a quarterback at Mohawk Trail
Regional High School said he would boycott the event, which for
years was sponsored by the Friends of Mohawk Football, unless his
mother could attend.
   ``A lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers,
but they couldn't come to our banquet,'' Quarterback Owa Brandstein
said. ``It was blatant discrimination and just plain wrong.''
   After Brandstein complained late last year, the banquet was
canceled. But a group of parents stepped in and arranged the new
event, scheduled for Saturday night with Boston College Coach Jack
Bicknell as speaker.
   ``In most cases, whole families _ mothers, fathers, sisters and
brothers _ are coming,'' said Stuart Eisenberg, Brandstein's
father. ``What we are trying to do is not be divisive, but
recognize that we are a football family. Even the coach's wife can
come.''

   Pun-lovers 341, killjoys 94.
   Voters faced with choosing between a time-honored slogan and
clean language have decided that this Livingston County village of
3,400 will once again greet motorists with signs that read ``Best
Town by a Damsite.''
   The village, 30 miles south of Rochester, had the slogan removed
from signs last summer after some residents complained that the pun
was distasteful. But after the new signs went up, other residents
said they missed the slogan and wanted it restored.
   In a vote Tuesday, slogan defenders defeated opponents who
wanted it removed by a count of 341-94.
   ``I think it belongs there,'' said resident Pat Crowley, who
voted to restore the slogan. ``It's been there for years and years
and years and years and what's wrong with saying `damn?' I say a
lot worse than that.''
   The nearby Mount Morris dam was completed in 1952 to control
flooding from the Genesee River.

   The challenge: How to save as many trees as
possible while clearing underbrush for a $13 million municipal
complex.
   The problem: Heavy machinery used to clear land often damages
root systems, which can kill trees.
   The solution: Betsy the mule.
   ``The mule doesn't make near the mess that a tractor does,''
said Wayne Mabry, the subcontractor responsible for clearing the
30-acre site.
   He borrowed Betsy from a Cherokee County sawmill where the
animal usually works to haul sled loads of underbrush from the
building site to a shredder at the edge of the property.
   ``I pondered on the thought of using manpower, but that would
have cost me a fortune,'' Mabry said. ``Being a country boy like I
am, I just decided to use a mule, because economics made it
feasible.''
   Renting a light tractor and buying fuel for it would have cost
about $2,000, Mabry said. Betsy works for $500 a month, and a
friend is providing room and board.

<LEADPARA>  Traditional Mardi Gras drunkenness and breast-baring irreverence exploded on
New Orleans streets Tuesday, colored this year with extra doses of flamboyant
wartime patriotism.;    Effigies and caricatures of Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein hung from oak trees and lamp posts. Among the usual scantily clad men
and women lining the streets were dozens of Statues of Liberty, Betsy Rosses
and make-believe soldiers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "You can forget about the war for a little while, especially today," said
tourist Donna Crowe, 27, dressed as Miss Liberty. "But it will be back before
long.";    Parade-goers camped out overnight along parade routes to stake out
territory, setting up tents and barbecue grills. They wanted to be in position
to catch beads and other junk tossed by maskers on the hundreds of floats in
successive parades on Mardi Gras -- French for Fat Tuesday, the day before
Lent begins.;    Parades included the procession of Rex, King of Carnival and
head of a secretive "krewe" of high society, old-money businessmen. Also
rolling was the all-black Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, which started 75
years ago as a spoof of the more staid, all-white krewes.;    In between
traditional krewes rolled the truck parades, in which any group with a
decorated flatbed truck and a few hundred dollars for an entry fee could
join.;    Parodies of Iraqi dress were the costume of choice for many. Andre
McDonald, 42, of New Orleans donned Arab robes and called himself Abdullah the
Absent.;    "I wish I could be with my people in the desert," he joked, "but
there's shooting going on there, and there's drinking going on here.";   
There had been talk of canceling Carnival parades when the Persian Gulf war
broke out last month, but city officials said that would be economic suicide
in a city still suffering the effects of the mid-'80s oil bust. Officials
estimated that Mardi Gras would pump about $480 million into the local economy
this year.;    Various estimates put the crowds at about 1 million, although
there had been speculation that terrorism fears and the recession might reduce
attendance. Hotel bookings were down to 91 percent from about 98 percent going
into the final weekend of Carnival.;    Police said they had an anti-terrorism
plan in effect but refused to discuss it.;    The raunchier side of the
celebration unfolded in the French Quarter, where cross-dressers roamed the
streets with abandon and women bared breasts in return for Mardi Gras
trinkets.;    Even there, the war and patriotism theme was prominent. A dozen
giant roaches carried American flags.  </TEXT>

   Sandy Duncan says she's happy now that she
doesn't have to hide behind the happy persona she created for her
first television series, ``Funny Face.''
   Miss Duncan developed a benign brain tumor behind an eye while
working on the early 1970s series and going through a divorce. She
attributed her headaches and double vision to stress.
   ``No one knew what was wrong,'' Miss Duncan said in Dec. 31's TV
Guide. ``They kept calling it a nervous breakdown _ `Poor little
thing, all this stress and publicity and a divorce, too.'''
   The tumor eventually was found and removed, although she lost her
vision in one eye.
   She had created the happy-go-lucky personality for ``Funny Face''
and kept it up even after the operation, running around the
hospital, checking on other patients and signing autographs.
   ``I was locked into that perky, cheerful personality,'' she said,
adding that a psychologist warned her she was hiding behind it.
   She met a doctor at the hospital and they married. By mutual
agreement, Miss Duncan kept her appearances to a minimum.
   ``So, I didn't work for a while and that have me a chance to grow
up,'' Miss Duncan said. ``Now I don't need that cute and perky
persona anymore. I'm real clear on who I am.''
   Miss Duncan has remarried entertainer Don Correia, and is the
mother of two boys. She said she now feels completely comfortable
with life on the personal side and with her current television
family, ``The Hogan Family.''
   ``I have made a decision to be happy, and I am,'' Miss Duncan
said.

   Actor Gary Busey is spending the holidays in
the hospital as he continues to recover from head injuries suffered
in a motorcycle crash three weeks ago.
   ``He is stable, improving and progressing,'' Peggy Staff,
spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said Monday.
   Busey, 44, who lobbied against mandatory motorcyle helmet laws,
was not wearing a helmet Dec. 4 when he lost control of his bike,
fell and hit the back of his head on a curb. He underwent 90 minutes
of neurosurgery.
   The actor has been able to talk with his family, and his motor
skills are good, said Ms. Staff, adding that doctors expect a full
recovery.

   Today's ambitious women are ``looking for the
superficial things'' in males, says a group that announced Donald
Trump, Tony Danza and Lou Gossett Jr. are among the year's 10 most
watchable men.
   The list in 1988 represents a variety of attributes that include
attractiveness and success, Suzy Mallery, president of the
15,000-member Manwatchers Inc., said Monday.
   `They want it all, and this year's list has it,'' Ms. Mallery
said. ``Big bulging muscles have never been important, but now
dress, grooming and keeping in good physical shape has become much
more important.
   ``Good manners and communication are equally essential.''
   But women seem to be looking more at looks, Ms. Mallery said.
``Today's ambitious women are looking for the superficial things,
the bright and the savvy. It wasn't that way when we started in
1975,'' she said.
   Also making the grade this year were Paul Newman, Mel Gibson,
Kenny Rogers, John F. Kennedy Jr., Andrew McCarthy, Alan Thicke, and
Tony Curtis.
   Three previous contenders _ Burt Reynolds, Tom Selleck and Don
Johnson _ weren't eligible this year because Manwatchers elevated
them to its Hall of Fame, allowing room for new faces. Previous
inductees include Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford.

   ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson and his
ex-wife, actress Melanie Griffith, plan to remarry after an 11-year
hiatus during which each went from unknown to star.
   ``No date has been set,'' Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said
Monday in a statement by telephone from Aspen, Colo. He wouldn't
disclose where the wedding will be or where the couple is spending
the holidays.
   ``Both Don and Melanie wish to enjoy this very special time
together,'' Mintz said. ``In order to provide a sense of dignity and
privacy, there will be no press conference, photo opportunities,
interviews or further statement.''
   Miss Griffith, 31, star of the current hit movie ``Working
Girl,'' married the then-little-known Johnson in 1976. They divorced
the following year. She is the daughter of actress Tippi Hedren.
   She later married, then divorced, actor Steven Bauer, and they
have a 3{-year-old son, Alexander.
   Johnson, 39, recently was romantically involved with entertainer
Barbra Streisand, and the two sang together on the Top 10 adult
contemporary hit ``Till I Loved You.''
   Johnson has a 5-year-old son from his relationship with Patti
D'Arbanville.
   Johnson, who plays the scruffy vice cop Sonny Crockett on the
NBC-TV series, and Miss Griffith have reportedly been living
together in Miami.

FT  11 MAY 91 / Cookery: An autumn taste of Tuscany - Philippa Davenport
commends an Italian cookery course to Weekend FT readers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I DID not enjoy my schooldays much but I would not mind becoming a student
again if it meant attending the Villa Arceno in Tuscany for its one-week
term in October.
The subject on the curriculum is A Taste of Tuscany and the co-hosts and
organisers are Anna Del Conte and Betsy Newell. Their talents, the location
and the provisional programme suggest a lovely blend of food, culture,
comfort and fun.
Betsy is no newcomer to cookery schools. She has been at the helm of her own
in London for the past 10 successful years, and she has owned a house near
Arceno for twice that long so she knows the Chianti Classico area well. Anna
Del Conte is Britain's most respected writer on Italian food, author of the
indispensable Gastronomy of Italy and the best-selling Secrets from an
Italian Kitchen.
The Villa Arceno estate is a beautiful 4,000 acres. It fell into disrepair
and neglect after the war and is only now recovering under the management of
a new consortium of owners. Gradually the buildings and land, the olive
groves, vineyards, woods, parks and gardens are being resuscitated. The
villa itself, built in the 17th century, restored and extended in 1825,
reopened this spring, refurbished as a small luxury class hotel. It is here
that the party will stay and the cookery school will be held.
There is no obligation to attend the classes. Non-cooking partners are free
to shoot pheasant, help harvest and tread the grapes, ride (horses or
mountain bikes), play tennis or swim.
The cookery classes will embrace techniques and the quality of ingredients
as well as regional recipes, their history and development. There will be
talks, tastings, discussions and demonstrations. And everyone will be
encouraged to try their hand at making pasta. There will be advice about
buying pasta and pasta-making machines. Tortellini and rotolo will be made.
The latter is little catherine wheels of pasta lusciously stuffed with
spinach, cheese and prosciutto. Prosciutto? Cue for discussion and
comparative tasting of Parma, San Daniele and other hams.
Traditional polenta recipes will be made using oven, pressure cooker and
old-fashioned stirring methods. The degree of milling needed for different
purposes will be examined, as will the merits of traditional versus
pre-cooked. Demonstrations will include polenta layered and baked with a
four-cheese sauce, and polenta moulded in a ring, the centre of which may be
filled with a wild mushroom sauce.
Autumn vegetables will be stuffed, including red peppers filled with
monkfish. There will be tastings of the new season's nuts and favourite
Tuscan recipes using local chestnuts and chestnut flour.
Game from the estate - wild boar, duck and venison as well as pheasant  -
will provide star turns, including a dish of boar in a medieval sauce to
which chocolate is added. Although boar is now obtainable in Britain, I am
assured that hare or spicily marinated pork make fine alternative candidates
for this treatment.
Lunches, whether taken in the Villa or as a fete champetre by the lake, will
tend to relate to the morning's cookery class. Dinner will usually be taken
in neighbourhood restaurants, some smart, some family affairs, all offering
characteristic Tuscan fare.
Food, although the pivot on which the course turns, is by no means the be
all and end all of things. The idea is to give the visitor a taste of all
things Tuscan, culture as well as cuisine - and the grape. A tour of the
estate's winery is planned and a tasting of wines from the region.
There will be opportunities to explore the history and art of the area with
leisurely afternoons and evenings in Siena, where an art expert will join
the party. One day will be spent in Florence and there will be a visit to
Pienza, a jewel of a Renaissance town famed for some of the best pecorino
cheese in all Italy. A feast of architectural treats and Epicurean delights
for Italophiles.
Just 20 places are available on the trip which will run from October 12-19
(a second one-week course will probably follow). The cost is Pounds 1300 per
person. This is based on sharing a room and does not include aperitifs or
spirits, but is basically an all-inclusive price.
For details and bookings contact: Anna Del Conte, 93 Elm Bank Gardens,
London SW13 ONX. Tel: 081-876- 4509.
PEPPERS STUFFED WITH AUBERGINES &amp; CROUTONS
This recipe is a sneak preview from Anna Del Conte's Entertaining
All'Italiana, to be published by Bantam in September. It will serve six as a
first or main course, when it might be teamed with other stuffed vegetables
or a dish of cannellini beans dressed with garlic, parsley and oil.
Although the recipe is written for immediately consecutive cooking and
eating, Anna points out that most of the tasks can be done well ahead. The
peppers can be grilled, wrapped and stored in the fridge up to three days in
advance, and both croutons and aubergines can be cooked up to two days
ahead. Always, however, delay adding the croutons to the aubergine mixture
until ready to stuff and bake the peppers.
6 meaty peppers, red and yellow; 1 1/2 lb aubergines; 4 slices good white
bread, 1-2 days old, cut into  1/2 inch cubes; vegetable oil and extra
virgin olive oil; 1 garlic clove; 1 dried chilli, seeded and crumbled; 4
anchovy fillets; 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and dried; 4 tablespoons
chopped parsley; 1 dozen black olives (optional).
Peel the aubergines, cut into  1/2 inch cubes and sweat with salt in a
colander for at least half an hour.
Meanwhile char the peppers over a direct flame or using a very hot grill.
Keep a watch on them and turn them so they blacken evenly.
While keeping an eye on the peppers, heat some vegetable oil and when very
hot fry the bread until golden. Drain well.
When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel and halve them. Discard
cores, seeds and ribs. Place in an oiled dish.
Rinse and dry the aubergine cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil and saute
the aubergine until cooked, about 6 minutes, stirring frequently.
Chop the garlic, chilli and anchovy fillets and add to the aubergine with
half the parsley. Cook for 1 minute. Draw off the heat, add the capers and
adjust seasoning.
Add the croutons to the aubergine and fill the peppers with the mixture.
Sprinkle with the remaining parsley, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil
and bake for 10 minutes in an oven heated to 200 degrees C (400 degrees F)
Gas mark 6.
Do not serve this dish straight from the oven; let it rest for half an hour
or so, since stuffed vegetables are much nicer just warm. Scatter with the
olives just before serving.

bring the field of the U.S. Women's Open to its knees, perhaps it was not
surprising that the second-round co-leader didn't know it.;    "All I know is

Bradley, 40, the all-time leading money-winner on the LPGA Tour, shares the
second-round lead at even-par 142 with Joan Pitcock, who has not won in four
years on the tour.;    Pitcock shot a 1-over 72 and Bradley a 73 on Friday.;  
 They are one shot ahead of Alice Ritzman and Amy Alcott, the 1980 U.S.
Women's Open champion who shot a 68 Friday.;    Defending champion Betsy King
barely made the cut, 10 shots behind, with a 7-over-par 78.;    "I am a little
surprised," Bradley said. "There's always a player or two or three that makes
liars of tough conditions and tough putting. But I guess we all have been kept
at bay with the wind, heat and putting surfaces.";    "It was a long day. Five
hours is an awful long time to be out there. Golf is a game of momentum, and
for 16 holes we were twiddling our thumbs out there. I thought a 73 was pretty
good, to tell the truth.";    Pitcock, 23, said she was surprised to be tied
for the lead.;    "It's different as a professional," she said. "You have to
worry about making cuts, and as an amateur you could freewheel it. I'm
surprised to be here.";    LPGA champion Meg Mallon shot a 75 and was in a
group of five at 145 that included former champion JoAnne Carner.;    King was
disenchanted with her playing partners, the greens and the course as she saw
her bid for a third consecutive Open title dim.;    "It's been a strange week,
and obviously I would like to have played better," said King, who made it
clear she didn't like historic Colonial and its sun-baked, spike-marked bent
grass greens.;    "I can't say it's one of my favorite courses," King said.
"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed in the conditions.";    King
wiped away tears several times during her interview, then became so emotional
she left the press room through a back curtain.;    She posted two double
bogeys and a triple bogey Friday. Twice she miscalculated iron shots and found
the water.;    "It was hard to judge out there, a big guessing game," she
said. "It takes more than talent to hit a shot.";    Earlier in the week, she
had complained about pin placements, the watering of greens during the round,
and being paired with amateur Sandrine Mendiburu of France.;      U.S. Open;

UNCOVERING THE OUTRAGE OF INCEST  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Books
Sexton's most recent novel is "Private Acts"; her second novel, "Mirror
Images," dealt with incest. In cooperating with Diane Middlebrook on a
forthcoming biography of poet Anne Sexton, she speaks about her own sexual
abuse as a child by her mother.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  By Betsy Petersen; Bantam Books, 192 pp., $19;  THERE are some experiences so
ugly and damaging that the mind represses them, erasing their memory from
consciousness while their impact remains forever imprinted on the soul. These
experiences survive unarticulated, buried in the recesses of the mind,
emitting noxious gases that poison a life silently and secretly.;   
Sometimes, however, a person is courageous and determined enough to dig for
the source of the contamination. Betsy Petersen is such a woman, and "Dancing
With Daddy" is the moving story of her exploration into the ruins of her
childhood.;    Written almost like a journal, complete with dreams,
nightmares, fantasies and meditations, "Dancing With Daddy" tackles one of the
most disturbing, taboo subjects in our society: incest -- in this case, a
father's sexual abuse of his two daughters. Recently, increasing national
attention has been directed toward identifying incest survivors and helping
them recover from the trauma, and there has been discussion within the
American Psychiatric Association about broadening the diagnosis of
post-traumatic stress disorder to include incest victims.;    Deceptive
appearances;  "Dancing With Daddy" is a personal narrative of one child's
experience with sexual abuse and should convince even the most skeptical that
such a travesty can and does occur, far more frequently than most of us would
like to admit, in homes that appear normal.;    Betsy Petersen was 3 years old
when her father, a returning World War II veteran and surgeon suffering from
depression over his temporary unemployment, began entering her room during her
afternoon nap. As he masturbated himself against the bars of her crib, he also
put his "surgeon's hands" into her underpants and masturbated her. His abusive
behavior continued until she was 18, moving from mutual masturbation to oral
sex to sexual intercourse, but Petersen would not remember it until she
entered psychotherapy at age 45, when all those years of "eating the pain"
began to have inevitable repercussions on her roles as a wife and mother.;   
In his public life, Clinton Ervin was a respected, well-liked surgeon with a
lucrative practice in Hillsborough. At the time of his death, the church
overflowed with mourners, and Betsy and her mother received innumerable
condolence letters, some of which are included in the book. They are
unnecessary, for Petersen's narrative has demonstrated the gulf between her
father's inner and outer lives. Her portrait gives the reader a man complete
with strengths and weaknesses; this tragedy occurred in what looked to be an
ordinary home. In fact, the book's most profound and frightening aspect is
that monsters such as Clint Ervin move among us all the time, but we cannot
see them -- or choose not to see them -- because they look remarkably like
ourselves.;    Her mother's alcoholism, collusive silence and evasion of the
truth about what was happening to her daughters are also confronted. Like many
incest survivors, Petersen feels equally enraged with her mother for closing
her eyes and not protecting her daughter in the manner every child has the
right to expect.;    Although she has confronted her mother with her memories
and expressed her anger, there appears to be a lack of resolution between
them. At the time of publication, her mother -- whose name does not appear in
the book -- had chosen not to read the book or ask about its contents.
However, her mother, now a psychiatric social worker with a master's degree
from the University of California, Berkeley, did not oppose her daughter's
decision to publish her story or to use her own name.;    Petersen's sister,
Pat, 11 years older, was the only daughter from her mother's first marriage.
Ervin abused his stepdaughter in the bedroom the two girls shared, penetrating
her after he had finished fondling Betsy, particularly on those evenings when
he and his wife had quarreled. Petersen recovered her memories of the
incestuous episodes too late to share them with her sister, who was killed in
an automobile accident with her second husband when she was 33 and Betsy 22.
Although they were never able to validate each other's rage by discussing
their father's betrayal, Petersen feels that her memory of her sister's abuse
was integral to the process of coming to terms with her own. "She was my ally.
She was the only one in the world who knew what life with my parents was
like.";    The next generation;  As an adult, Petersen had great difficulty
raising her own children, finding that their needs threw her into a panic
because they were subconscious reminders of those demands she had found so
terrifying as a child. She went into therapy as much to help and protect her
two sons as to help herself, and when her memory reasserted itself to unload
its overdue shipment of pain, she kept the image of her children directly in
front of her as incentive to continue.;     Because keeping the secret was so
integral a part of the abuse, Petersen, now a writer in Metairie, La., wanted
to make it public as a way to deny her father the silence he had so long
required. This book may be only a symbolic gesture now -- but it is one aimed
toward crucial emotional healing. Clint Ervin wanted his daughter to be a
writer, and she now has written her first book: What justice that she has at
last told the truth about events he told her over and over never took place.; 
  "Dancing With Daddy" is uneven in places, perhaps because this is Petersen's
first book and its subject matter is so agonizing. The intensity with which
she writes is admirable, though, and of particular beauty are the dream
sequences that chart the process by which she discovered exactly what was done
to her and how she felt about it.;     The most evocative and powerful
sections of the book are those in which Petersen describes how a child
experiences overwhelming sexual sensations: the pleasure, the terror, the
pain, the fantasy of damage to one's self, one's body and even one's parent.
She details her deep confusion and shame over what her father coerced her to
do -- and to keep secret -- in the name of love.;     "Dancing With Daddy" is
a chronicle of rage and grief and love; at its conclusion, Petersen accepts
the loss of her childhood to her parents' narcissism and learns to take
responsibility for, and to love, the child who remains within her. In
confronting her past, she creates a new life for herself and offers her
children her greatest gift -- the kind of childhood she was never allowed to
have. Bravo.  </TEXT>

William Saroyan, for instance, describes the 1939 setting for "The Time of Your 
Life," which is being revived here by the Professional Actors Conservatory of 
Rancho Santiago College, as a specifically "American place." It is a San 
Francisco waterfront bar, home to every imaginable neighborhood type. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish are here along with the Italians and the Arabs. The hookers stop by 
along with the swells. So do the cops and the dockworkers, the sailors and the 
drunks, the newsboys and the con men, the lovelorn and the simply lost. The 
place fairly teems with the species Homo Americanus like a zoo on a quietly 
domestic Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But in fact, Nick's Pacific Street Saloon, Restaurant and Entertainment Palace 
could have existed only in Saroyan's affectionate world, certainly not in the 
real one then or now. 
</P>
<P>
The righteous proprietor of Nick's live-and-let-live honky-tonk pours free 
drinks, takes a strictly fatherly interest in the local hookers, tosses an 
intrusive vice cop on his ear, provides meals as well as work for the 
unemployed and gets regular visits from his white-haired old mother. 
</P>
<P>
And Nick isn't even the hallowed saint of this whimsically meandering, 
post-Depression paean to the common man. 
</P>
<P>
That honor goes to a gentle Irishman with a bum leg, one of the saloon regulars 
named Joe. He sits around drinking champagne, while flirting with the ladies 
and dispensing dollar bills from his vest-pocket bankroll to anyone who shows 
the slightest need of money. Joe's largess goes so far that it extends beyond 
mere acquaintances to anonymous passersby on the street. 
</P>
<P>
When the newsboy arrives to hawk his papers, Joe buys not one but all of them 
and tosses them away unread -- a munificent gesture, both charming and cynical. 
When desolate Kitty Duvall can't make the rent on her hooker's wages, Joe peels 
more bills and pays for her move to a better hotel. When his gofer, Tom, needs 
a fresh start in love and in life, Joe arranges everything. 
</P>
<P>
Because "The Time of Your Life" is virtually all texture and no plot, a series 
of acting "moments" strung out over nearly three hours, the strength of any 
production is particularly dependent on the quality of the players. Meanwhile, 
the very reasons that make it a difficult play to negotiate -- 26 speaking 
roles, for example -- also make it a desirable choice for a training program. 
</P>
<P>
Victor's Pappas' PAC staging happily manages to finesse the problem of cast 
inexperience with directorial clarity and several nicely shaped collegiate 
performances, despite a glaring weakness in the central role of Joe, wanly 
played by Phillip Beck (the lone professional actor and, ironically, the 
conservatory director). 
</P>
<P>
If Mark Ciglar gives the comedy's most extroverted and entertaining performance 
as Kit Carson, a Western old-timer with a con man's gift of gab and a skein of 
eccentric stories, Darin Heames gives the most authentic performance as Dudley, 
a bespectacled young man desperately trying to connect with the woman he loves 
on the saloon's public telephone. 
</P>
<P>
But the real test of the production's authenticity comes in the roles of Harry, 
the would-be hoofer-comedian who wants to break into show business, and Wesley, 
the starving drifter whose talent for noodling on the piano turns into gainful 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
As Harry, Pete Benson somehow creates the illusion that he can do a bit of soft 
shoe, though he doesn't really seem a dancer. But, much more than that, Benson 
captures the yearning innocence that one imagines Gene Kelly projecting as the 
original Harry in the Broadway production. In his climactic speech, which is 
one of the subtler peaks of the play, Benson achieves a wonderful, double-edged 
flush of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley, a totally self-effacing role that reflects a certain amount of racial 
stereotyping, has less importance as a character but is essential to the 
texture of the play just the same. Saroyan calls him "a colored boy" in his 
stage directions, and he is supposed to be portrayed by a black actor. Here he 
is played by David Fraioli, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice of casting someone with the right skin color who can't play 
the piano or someone with the wrong skin color who can, Pappas made the 
appropriate move. It would have been disconcerting to listen to canned music 
for the piano tunes that compose so much of the play's aural backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, James Rice gives a solid-as-rock portrayal of Nick. Sam Zeller 
brings a blushing energy to the boyish Tom. Betsy Ferguson has the right look 
as Kitty, though she needs more personal allure. 
</P>
<P>
Notable cameos include Barth L. Maher as the union intellectual McCarthy, Dan 
Cole as the sadistic vice cop Blick, Terra Shelman as an enthralled society 
lady and Jeff Hutcherson as a drunk who bounces off the furniture like a 
billiard ball. 
</P>
<P>
Mention must also be made of the attractive set, particularly the red-and-blue 
jukebox that plays and replays "The Missouri Waltz," and the "American Destiny" 
pinball machine, a flag-waving contraption that is played nonstop for the 
entire length of the show by Todd Terry as the silently obsessive pinball whiz 
Willie.
